00:01 - [Music]
00:07 - hello guys welcome back to another
00:10 - tutorial hit the bell icon button so
00:12 - that you don't miss out any tutorial hey
00:16 - everyone welcome to html5 from scratch
00:19 - we're going to be learning all about how
00:22 - html5 works and all the different
00:26 - technologies that work with html5 to
00:29 - become a web developer so this course is
00:32 - going to cover a lot of things we're
00:34 - going to cover html5 we're going to
00:36 - cover CSS we're going to cover a
00:40 - responsive web design introduction to
00:42 - JavaScript and how to deploy to the
00:45 - Internet we're even going to cover how
00:48 - to set up git and use github which is an
00:51 - essential tool for all web developers we
00:54 - are going to get into some more advanced
00:58 - things like animations using CSS we're
01:02 - going to talk about and use CSS
01:05 - frameworks such as bootstrap and
01:07 - materialise and others we are going to
01:10 - create several projects throughout the
01:11 - course small projects to help us learn
01:14 - our skills and then a bigger final
01:17 - project that to build which will be a a
01:21 - professional portfolio with a working
01:24 - contact form that we are going to learn
01:26 - how to deploy using Netta fly and we're
01:36 - going to be even learning a little bit
01:38 - about the backend and how that all works
01:39 - using git and github so even if you are
01:44 - knowledgeable about HTML and CSS and
01:47 - even a little little JavaScript this
01:50 - course is going to put everything
01:52 - together and you will I think get a lot
01:55 - out of it
02:00 - even though it is for anyone and it's
02:04 - for everyone we are going to start at
02:06 - the very beginning so if you have no
02:08 - prior knowledge of web development or
02:10 - coding this course is for you if you do
02:13 - know some of the some of the HTML
02:15 - concepts and basic CSS and basic
02:19 - JavaScript you can feel free to fast
02:22 - forward through some things skip things
02:24 - all together but this is going to be a
02:26 - comprehensive course that will give
02:31 - knowledge and skills on how to put
02:33 - everything together all the way to the
02:35 - final deployment so HTML was developed
02:42 - by Tim berners-lee in 1990
02:45 - it's short for hypertext markup language
02:47 - and it's used to create web pages that
02:51 - are displayed on the web you also can
02:54 - connect pages to other pages with
02:55 - hyperlinks html5 was first introduced in
03:02 - 2008 and then it was stabilized you made
03:07 - it might even say standardized in 2014
03:10 - and is the newest version of HTML if you
03:13 - look into the history of HTML there is
03:16 - some interesting things that happened
03:18 - from 2008 and to 2014 that you can learn
03:23 - more about about the standardization of
03:26 - it and how it evolved anyway
03:30 - html5 uses the basic rules as older
03:33 - versions but will at but add some new
03:36 - tags and attributes which makes it a lot
03:40 - easier it's just easier than ever to to
03:45 - create web applications we are going to
03:52 - learn and use quite a few of the new
03:56 - html5 technologies we are going to delve
04:01 - into learning about some of the advanced
04:03 - things like canvas and C f/c SVG
04:07 - features using audio and video and
04:10 - incorporating those things into our web
04:13 - page
04:14 - and even look into web storage and local
04:17 - storage then we're going to be using
04:20 - some of the more common new elements
04:23 - like section figcaption nav headers
04:30 - footers and then we're also going to be
04:34 - creating a contact form page on our
04:38 - final project and use a lot of the new
04:41 - input types so here's an example of what
04:49 - the old version of HTML looks like when
04:53 - you begin an HTML page and it has all it
04:58 - has all the same things that html5 has
05:00 - except it's a little Messier there's
05:02 - just things that we don't have to see
05:04 - anymore it's pretty it's it's it's not
05:07 - easy to read it's not easy to understand
05:10 - so let's compare it to the new version
05:13 - the html5 version which is a lot cleaner
05:17 - easier to read easier to write so let's
05:21 - talk about some of the different things
05:22 - that you're seeing so at the top you're
05:24 - going to have a tag that says doctype
05:27 - HTML and that is telling our browser
05:29 - that this is an HTML page and then we
05:33 - have our HTML opening a closing tag and
05:36 - we're going to learn that in HTML we
05:39 - need to have an opening and a closing
05:40 - tag for everything so what that means is
05:44 - the opening tag is a greater than and
05:46 - and a less I'm sorry a less than and a
05:51 - greater than and then the closing HTML
05:53 - is the great that's less than slash and
05:57 - then the greater than and everything
05:59 - inside of that duck of that HTML tag is
06:02 - what encapsulate s' the HTML document
06:07 - then we have to have a head tag and
06:11 - here's the opening head and here's the
06:14 - closing head and then we have a body tag
06:17 - opening and closing and everything
06:20 - inside the body tag is what you see on
06:23 - the page so it's what the user will
06:26 - in the browser the the the elements that
06:30 - are inside of the head are not seen on
06:33 - the browser and I'll explain that when
06:35 - we start doing it ourselves the things
06:39 - that are in the head are very important
06:41 - but they're not something the brow that
06:43 - the users going to see so for example
06:45 - this is some information that for
06:48 - example your search engine BOTS are
06:51 - going to be reading to understand what
06:54 - the page has it's going to have a title
06:56 - and so your search engine BOTS will read
06:59 - the title and then it might even have a
07:01 - description and when you go to a search
07:04 - engine and you look up a you do a search
07:07 - and you and you find some webpages you
07:10 - often will see you'll see the title and
07:12 - the description in the search engine you
07:15 - know the page and then you'll know kind
07:17 - of oh do I want to go visit this site or
07:19 - do I not want to go visit the site and
07:21 - that's what where you see that's where
07:23 - this stuff is put in and then this meta
07:26 - tag here talks about the kind of
07:28 - characters that we're going to be using
07:29 - in this page you also could have a a
07:33 - meta tag that talks about the language
07:36 - that you're going to be using and then
07:37 - you're going to also add some other
07:40 - things called link tags that are going
07:42 - to help us to link our stylesheet to our
07:46 - HTML page now in the body this is where
07:50 - the text and images are going to live
07:55 - and this is what we see on the browser
07:57 - and we're going to be learning how to
07:59 - write all these different elements this
08:01 - is an h1 element and this is a pair a P
08:04 - element or a paragraph element and H
08:06 - stands for headings this is a heading 1
08:09 - element and it's gonna show this these
08:12 - words with very large text so h1 is the
08:16 - largest text that we can display whereas
08:20 - a paragraph tag is going to display this
08:23 - text as normal text and there's all
08:26 - types of different elements that we can
08:29 - create on our browser and on our page
08:35 - CSS is something totally different and
08:37 - what it does is it makes the things that
08:41 - we see on the browser the different
08:42 - elements it styles those different
08:44 - elements and makes them more interesting
08:46 - to look at and more pleasing to see so
08:49 - for example with CSS you can make your
08:52 - text different colors different sizes
08:55 - you can put under you can underline it
08:58 - you can do all kinds of things to your
09:00 - text you can Center it on the page you
09:03 - can do some animations to it you can add
09:08 - so when you add images to your page you
09:10 - can Center those images you can move
09:12 - them around you can make them circles
09:13 - images instead of squares you can add
09:16 - shadows to those images you can add
09:18 - borders to those images and same with
09:20 - any element so you're styling sheet is
09:24 - going to make your webpage look
09:26 - beautiful now the cascading refers to
09:31 - which style rule applies if more than
09:34 - one rule matches a particular element so
09:37 - for example if at the top of your CSS
09:40 - page CSS file you make a rule that your
09:45 - h1 tag or heading is going to be read
09:49 - then if later on down the page you make
09:53 - another rule that h1 is going to be
09:55 - green then those are conflicting so in
09:59 - the cascading the cascading version the
10:03 - way it works is that the green one the
10:05 - one at the bottom is going to override
10:07 - the one at the top because it cascades
10:09 - down so that's what the cascading refers
10:12 - to it that and those things will become
10:14 - more clear as we get involved in CSS a
10:23 - separate stylesheet is best practice so
10:27 - CSS is designed to enable the separation
10:31 - of your presentation and your content so
10:33 - your content is brought about by the
10:36 - HTML page but the presentation is
10:39 - brought about by the CSS file and what
10:43 - this does is it gives you more
10:44 - flexibility and it
10:47 - it becomes easier to to work through
10:51 - your your coding for example if your if
10:56 - you have multiple HTML pages they can
10:58 - all follow the same style from that
11:01 - separate CSS file that you created there
11:05 - is a way to put your style inside the
11:08 - HTML page or inside the HTML file in
11:13 - your code but it becomes very cumbersome
11:16 - and very it just becomes very difficult
11:18 - and to read and your file becomes
11:23 - gigantic and it's difficult to find
11:25 - things and to work with because it's so
11:28 - so humongous and it's you can't find
11:31 - anything anymore because you've got so
11:33 - much the other reason it's important is
11:38 - the CSS can help you change the styling
11:45 - for different versions of your HTML so
11:50 - if you are going to be writing for a
11:52 - mobile phone and a tablet and a desktop
11:55 - you can use that CSS separate CSS file
11:58 - to denote how you want your HTML to
12:01 - appear on the different sizes and that
12:06 - talks that gets us right into responsive
12:10 - web design which is absolutely very very
12:13 - important for today's climate with all
12:16 - these different devices that everybody's
12:18 - using and we're going to learn
12:19 - techniques so that our apps look really
12:21 - good on all these different sizes and
12:23 - that's what responsive web design is all
12:25 - about and then we're going to do an
12:30 - introduction to javascript javascript is
12:33 - a high-level interpreted scripting
12:35 - language and we'll be building some
12:38 - small applications to learn basic
12:40 - javascript and to get some experience
12:42 - with how HTML CSS and JavaScript work
12:45 - together so for example if you're on oh
12:49 - if you're on a webpage and there's a
12:51 - part a place on the page where you can
12:54 - input as a user you can input your name
12:56 - your email some more inputs maybe your
12:59 - phone number your address
13:01 - and then there's a little button that
13:02 - you can click that says hey is this the
13:05 - same address as your billing address is
13:07 - the zoo shipping address is the same as
13:09 - your billing address and then you say
13:10 - click yes and then all of a sudden all
13:13 - those inputs that you just put in for
13:15 - your name and email just automatically
13:17 - gets inputted into the other fields
13:19 - without you having to write them in so
13:22 - that would be JavaScript powering that
13:24 - or let's say you're on a forum type of
13:27 - website and you can input some text and
13:30 - some some different things and your as
13:33 - the user and you click on a button and
13:36 - you add all that text to the page so
13:38 - that others can read it so those are all
13:41 - the different kinds of dynamic things
13:42 - that JavaScript offers so the materials
13:48 - that you're going to need for this
13:49 - course is just a text editor of your
13:51 - choice
13:52 - so popular text editors are Visual
13:55 - Studio code sublime and atom and others
13:59 - I'm going to be using Visual Studio code
14:02 - people refer to it as vs code and in our
14:05 - next video I'm going to give you a tour
14:07 - of vs code in case you decide to use it
14:11 - you are very welcome to use any text
14:14 - editor but if you've never used one you
14:16 - might as well just go ahead and use vs
14:18 - code and then your experience and Mike
14:20 - will be theirs will be the same as my
14:23 - experience so when we're coding together
14:25 - it'll be easier for you to follow along
14:27 - so that's it our next video we're going
14:31 - to be starting to code see you then
14:41 - hey everyone welcome back we're ready to
14:45 - start coding I like to start on a fresh
14:49 - on my desktop on a fresh desktop and
14:51 - begin with a new folder so I'm going to
14:56 - right-click on my desktop and hit new
15:00 - and then go over to folder and then
15:03 - we're going to title it whatever we
15:04 - would like so since we're just doing
15:07 - some practice I'm gonna title this one
15:09 - coding practice you may title it
15:13 - anything anything that you'd like okay
15:18 - so now that I have my folder I'm going
15:20 - to open up visual studio code and you'll
15:27 - see a welcome page and you can either go
15:30 - to open folder right here under the
15:33 - Start menu or you can go to your file
15:36 - and do the same thing where you would
15:37 - stay you would see where it says new
15:41 - folder not file open folder you would
15:45 - hit open folder and it's going to look
15:49 - in my look on my desktop and I'm just
15:52 - going to pick so I'm going to go to my
15:55 - desktop and I'm going to pick the folder
15:58 - that I just created which was coding
16:01 - practice and then I'm just going to
16:03 - select that folder so it's going to open
16:09 - that folder for us and that's where our
16:12 - code is going to live okay so here is
16:19 - that folder that we just created
16:21 - and the welcome page I'm going to go
16:25 - ahead and just delete it for now
16:27 - just close it out for now okay so now I
16:31 - have my coding practice folder so the
16:35 - first thing we're going to do is going
16:36 - to create an HTML file so we're gonna
16:38 - hit on click on the icon new file and
16:42 - most often we will title our initial
16:46 - HTML file index.html so index dot HTML
16:53 - and hit enter and it'll open up
16:59 - automatically for us okay so here is our
17:04 - index.html file and it's empty and what
17:07 - we're gonna do is we're going to use the
17:09 - feature on vs code where we just type in
17:11 - HTML and we get our little choice menu
17:17 - choice and we're gonna hit the one with
17:20 - a five and now we have our boilerplate
17:23 - so we'll change the title and I'm going
17:26 - to say coding practice and of course you
17:31 - can say whatever you want okay and what
17:36 - I'd like to do next is I'm just going to
17:38 - minimize go ahead and minimize this for
17:41 - a second
17:42 - so I can go back to my desktop now I'm
17:44 - going to go back to my folder or coding
17:47 - practice and now you can see inside that
17:48 - I have a index.html file inside there so
17:53 - if I open it up so we can see it and so
17:59 - there's my index.html file even though
18:03 - there's nothing in it yet so what I'm
18:05 - going to do is I'm going to right click
18:06 - on it and I'm actually going to do it
18:11 - again I'm gonna click on it first now
18:14 - now that it's selected I'm going to
18:15 - right click on it and I'm gonna say open
18:19 - with it should give me some choices here
18:22 - I can open up with Firefox Google
18:24 - Microsoft edge so I'm gonna open it up
18:28 - with Google doesn't really matter and
18:32 - that page is gonna open up but there's
18:35 - nothing in it yet because we haven't put
18:36 - anything in it yet so it's just going to
18:39 - be in our local environment this is on
18:41 - our on our own machine it's like our
18:46 - local server it's like so this is how
18:50 - you can see everything that you're going
18:52 - to write so what I'm gonna do is just
18:55 - minimize it a little bit just make it
18:58 - smaller and then I'm going to close out
19:01 - this and now I'm going to go back to my
19:03 - vs code and I'm going to go ahead
19:07 - minimize this a little bit just make it
19:09 - a little smaller so that I can see both
19:11 - screens so I want to be able to see my
19:15 - code and I want to be able to see the
19:17 - browser as well and then we're gonna
19:20 - start start coding inside the body and
19:22 - then we'll be able to refresh the
19:24 - browser and then see see the output okay
19:30 - so I'm in the body so let's start with
19:33 - some basic HTML tags so we're gonna
19:36 - start with our our header tags let's go
19:42 - ahead and start with all of our H ones
19:45 - so what you'll do is just start with a
19:49 - less-than like that and you'll say h1
19:54 - and then you'll close it and then
19:58 - automatically via the S code is going to
20:01 - give you your closing tag so you have
20:03 - your h1 here and then your closing h1
20:06 - and then inside the cursors already
20:08 - inside it so if you just hit enter then
20:12 - you can see that you can put something
20:15 - inside the attack now another way to do
20:19 - it in vs code is just type H 1 and hit
20:24 - enter and you get it so you don't have
20:26 - to type all the little greater than's
20:28 - and less than's
20:29 - so and you don't have to hit enter and
20:33 - separate them if you don't want to
20:35 - especially for the h1s and h2s and stuff
20:38 - you're not gonna be putting a lot of
20:40 - text inside there so I usually just
20:42 - leave it the way it is so let's say
20:44 - let's say my web page and we can put
20:47 - anything we want in here and then what
20:50 - I'd like you to do is save it so you can
20:52 - either go up to file and save or it
20:56 - would be a lot easier just to hit ctrl s
20:59 - so I'm hitting ctrl s and now I'm going
21:02 - to go over here to my browser and
21:04 - refresh or reload the page and now we
21:07 - see the output my web page alright this
21:11 - is exciting
21:12 - okay so let's keep going now I'm going
21:15 - to type h2 and hit enter and I'm going
21:19 - to just
21:20 - right some text this is an h2 and I'm
21:24 - gonna hit ctrl s to save it and then I'm
21:28 - going to refresh and then you can see
21:31 - that this text is smaller than the h1
21:34 - text now each browser has their own
21:38 - default styling so chrome is going to
21:42 - show this up show this in a certain way
21:45 - whereas if I had chosen Microsoft edge
21:47 - it might look different it will probably
21:50 - look different and then Firefox would
21:52 - look different and every single type of
21:54 - browser is going to have their own
21:55 - default styling we're gonna be
22:00 - overriding all of that when we do our
22:03 - own CSS and overriding some of it if not
22:10 - all of it so just wanted you to be aware
22:14 - of that okay so let's go ahead and do
22:18 - all of the different heading heading
22:20 - tags just to see the differences so h3
22:23 - and I'm gonna right here's an h3 and
22:30 - then I'm not gonna save it yet because I
22:32 - just want to do it first
22:33 - and then it will save it at the end
22:35 - let's do an h4 and we'll say hello and
22:42 - then we'll do an age 5 and we can say
22:52 - let's say hello world something
22:56 - different and then we'll do an h6 and
23:00 - that is it
23:01 - that's those are all of the different
23:04 - ages okay this is it okay now that I've
23:11 - done it I'm just gonna control s and
23:13 - refresh so you can see that they all get
23:18 - smaller and smaller as you get to the
23:20 - higher numbers okay so you can choose
23:23 - different headers for this larger larger
23:26 - text all right so let's next do some
23:32 - other elements so a very
23:34 - an element is a div a div element a div
23:39 - element is a container it's calm it's a
23:43 - common element that we use and it just
23:47 - contains it can contain other elements
23:49 - so let's go ahead and and put it in so
23:52 - div and hit enter and then I'm going to
23:56 - hit enter again and now I can kind of
23:59 - see my container so inside of my div I'm
24:03 - gonna go ahead and put a couple other
24:04 - elements in there so let's do an h2 and
24:07 - I'm gonna say what are dibs and then I'm
24:14 - going to do next and h5 just for fun and
24:19 - inside there I'm going to say divs are
24:22 - used so I'm basically just gonna be
24:25 - writing some text but at least this text
24:27 - is helpful for you so when you keep this
24:30 - code you can refer back to it and you
24:32 - know to see what the definitions of
24:33 - different things are so divs are used as
24:36 - containers it seems like it's better
24:40 - than just making nonsensical paragraphs
24:43 - of stuff so divs are uses containers for
24:46 - other HTML elements and help us divide
24:54 - our page into sections okay so I'm going
25:01 - to hit control s and refresh and then I
25:06 - can see that I have my div all right so
25:11 - there are a lot of other elements that
25:13 - are similar to divs in in that they
25:15 - create containers and create sections
25:18 - for our page and we have we have some of
25:22 - them are called
25:23 - SEC there's one called section there's
25:25 - one called article on one called us
25:27 - aside divs are real common but it's it's
25:32 - kind of nice to have the other ones just
25:34 - in case you want to you know it's just
25:38 - helpful for you as the developer to see
25:40 - your code and divide your code into
25:42 - different things that are more useful
25:43 - for you okay now why don't we do another
25:48 - why don't we do another one let's do a
25:51 - section a section tag section and then
25:55 - inside our section let's go ahead and
25:58 - practice doing some other elements so
26:01 - I'm going to do a paragraph element so P
26:06 - and so this is going to be normal text
26:09 - so I'm going to say this is a paragraph
26:13 - with normal sized text okay and let's do
26:21 - some other ones how about we try italic
26:23 - I and I hit enter and I'm going to write
26:28 - this is italic okay and then I'm gonna
26:34 - do another one called emphasis M is
26:38 - emphasis and I'm gonna say that this is
26:42 - emphasized text okay and you know what
26:50 - I'm gonna do I'm gonna go over here to
26:52 - my file icon and I'm going to click it
26:55 - and that's gonna get rid of all the
26:58 - folders and that way I can see more of
27:01 - my code and it's just a little easier
27:03 - for us to to to manage next I'm going to
27:07 - do strong strong as another element and
27:10 - that is going to be bold text so this
27:15 - text this element uses a bolder or
27:24 - stronger text okay and then finally what
27:29 - else should we use let's do now let's do
27:31 - bold
27:32 - let's do actual bold B there's one for
27:34 - bold and see if that's different this is
27:37 - bold text okay so why don't we save and
27:44 - refresh and see what we can come up with
27:47 - here alright so we can see that we have
27:50 - our paragraph text we have our italic
27:52 - our emphasized which look exactly the
27:55 - same to me and then we have the strong
27:57 - and the bold and again they look exactly
28:00 - the same as well
28:01 - so there are different choices but it
28:03 - seems like they're very similar you
28:07 - might notice that if you look down the
28:09 - page everything is you know everything
28:15 - is right next to each other like
28:17 - underneath each other
28:18 - everything's just goes to the next line
28:20 - next line next line next line until we
28:22 - get here
28:23 - you're italic and you're emphasized or
28:25 - right next to each other and you're
28:27 - you're strong and you're bold is right
28:29 - next to each other if I if I expand this
28:34 - this again these stay right next to each
28:38 - other this is by default these elements
28:42 - are called
28:43 - inline elements by default so they're
28:45 - going to stay in line whereas all the
28:47 - other ones are called block elements
28:49 - which means they're going to go to the
28:51 - next line next line next line so as you
28:53 - learn which ones are in line and which
28:55 - ones are block it'll help you to decide
28:58 - what to do for your design as you're
29:00 - starting to design design things so
29:02 - quickly if you were if you were sitting
29:04 - here going okay yeah I want to do some
29:06 - italics and stuff but I don't I wanted
29:08 - to go to the next line there's a couple
29:11 - different ways you could do it one is to
29:13 - use CSS but an easier way is to simply
29:16 - put a break in in the in the ones that
29:20 - are in line
29:20 - so for italic I would go I would just
29:24 - type BR and hit enter and it would the
29:27 - code the text editor would give me my
29:29 - closing and my opening and closing tags
29:33 - or brackets and a break is is a single
29:37 - element it doesn't have an opening and
29:40 - closing it's just all by itself and then
29:42 - if I do another break after my m BR and
29:46 - hit enter and then I do another one
29:49 - after my strong BR and hit enter and
29:52 - then I do a final one after my bold BR
29:55 - and enter so I've got these breaks if I
29:58 - save it it should and it will put these
30:01 - things on the next line so let's see if
30:04 - i refresh and then you can see that
30:07 - everything goes into the next line
30:09 - alright this is a good spot to stop and
30:13 - take a break
