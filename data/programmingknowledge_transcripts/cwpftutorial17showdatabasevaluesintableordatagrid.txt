00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:03 - WPF C application tutorial in the last
00:07 - video I have shown you how
00:09 - to get the corresponding
00:13 - values when you click
00:15 - some name or data in the combo box so
00:19 - when you select some data and the
00:21 - corresponding
00:23 - values for example employee ID and
00:26 - surname and age comes in these text
00:29 - boxes
00:31 - in this video I will show you how to
00:33 - connect your database with the data grid
00:37 - view or in simple word
00:41 - table so if you want to show the whole
00:45 - data in a single table you can do that
00:49 - in uh WPF uh cop so exactly that I'm
00:55 - going to show you today so let's get
00:58 - started
01:01 - stop the
01:04 - process and now I have
01:09 - this window here so what I will do is I
01:13 - will go to the text
01:15 - box not text box but the
01:19 - toolbox and I search for the data grid
01:24 - here so this is the data grid which
01:29 - holds our table data so just drag and
01:32 - drop into your
01:36 - window and it looks like
01:39 - this it's
01:41 - nothing but a blank data grid it has no
01:46 - column or no row
01:50 - set when you drag and drop this data
01:53 - grid view you can see in your XML or
01:57 - zaml View
02:02 - this line of code is added which is data
02:06 - grid which is this data grid Auto
02:09 - generate columns fals and all the
02:13 - properties of this data grid right what
02:16 - you need to do first
02:19 - is go here to autogenerate columns I
02:24 - will make it a little bit bigger so go
02:27 - here in autogenerate columns and and
02:30 - instead of false by default it's false
02:32 - you have to make
02:34 - it true
02:37 - okay so first thing you need to do is
02:41 - you need to do this true because what we
02:45 - are going to do is we are going to
02:48 - autogenerate columns we are not
02:51 - customize or we will not customize our
02:53 - columns but we will autogenerate the
02:56 - column with the data so that's why I
02:58 - made this
03:00 - true once you done with this what I will
03:03 - do is I will take a button from my
03:08 - tool box and drag and drop
03:13 - here and let me make it little bit
03:16 - smaller so we can see
03:19 - it and let me change the text of
03:26 - this button so I name it
03:31 - as
03:35 - load
03:37 - table and I change the name of this
03:40 - button
03:44 - also
03:47 - load
03:49 - table text okay so go to the properties
03:53 - and change this content and this button
03:57 - name now
04:00 - I want when I click this load table
04:03 - button my
04:05 - database values which is this
04:10 - database here it's a ski database which
04:13 - we are working on in last few videos I
04:17 - want to show employee
04:19 - ID name surname and age four columns I
04:23 - want to show in my data grip view as a
04:26 - table
04:27 - data okay
04:31 - so now I just double click this button
04:36 - and I go to the load table text button
04:40 - click
04:41 - event before writing uh any of the code
04:47 - okay first we write the skeleton of the
04:49 - code which we are writing from the last
04:53 - few videos to connect esite with the
04:58 - database
05:00 - sorry to connect our application with
05:03 - the escal
05:04 - database
05:06 - so I copy and paste this skeleton here
05:10 - make it a little bit bigger so these are
05:15 - the little this is a little skeleton
05:18 - which I use in every code to connect
05:22 - with my escal database
05:24 - right and if you don't recognize this
05:28 - code and you are watching this video
05:29 - video for the first time you can go to
05:32 - the first video in which I have shown
05:34 - you how to connect escal with your WPF
05:37 - cop application and you know what this
05:40 - code is so first is the connection
05:43 - escalet connection and I make a variable
05:46 - for escal connection is equal to new
05:48 - Escalade connection and I pass the
05:51 - database connection to it and then I
05:54 - make a try catch block to catch any
05:58 - exception and then then I open my escal
06:01 - database so I copy this escal Con dot
06:06 - open and then I prepare my query so this
06:10 - is a string type query is equal to
06:12 - select star from my table name this I
06:15 - will change but this is a simple query
06:20 - and then I prepare the
06:23 - command so I write escolite command
06:26 - create command is equal to new esite
06:28 - command and I passed the query and I
06:30 - passed the connection as an
06:33 - argument okay and then I execute my
06:37 - query so this command. execute non-query
06:41 - bracket and bracket close and once my
06:44 - query is executed I close my skite
06:49 - connection
06:51 - so if you want to copy this just pause
06:54 - the video and copy this whole
06:57 - code now I'm going to to add some more
07:01 - code to this so first thing we are going
07:05 - to add in this code
07:08 - is we are going to import one name space
07:13 - so just go at the top and right
07:19 - here
07:22 - using
07:24 - system.
07:26 - data okay just import this namespace if
07:29 - you don't have this if you already have
07:32 - this then don't worry you are on right
07:35 - path but if you don't have just import
07:40 - this name space here now once again we
07:44 - go to the button click event load table
07:47 - button click event this is our code and
07:51 - after this first of all we will prepare
07:54 - our query for example so in this query
07:59 - we we are passing select star from
08:01 - employee ID so what we want is to show
08:05 - only four columns right now in our
08:08 - database we have six
08:10 - column employee IDs name surname age
08:13 - username and password I just want these
08:16 - four columns so I write the name of
08:19 - these columns as a query so I instead of
08:22 - this star I write Eid comma name comma
08:31 - surname
08:32 - comma age okay select these four column
08:38 - values from my
08:39 - table okay these are the column
08:43 - names
08:44 - now everything
08:47 - is done command is set our Command is
08:52 - executed and now I want to transfer my
08:56 - data into the data grid View so this is
09:00 - the
09:01 - code in between this esite close and
09:06 - this command doxq query non-query
09:09 - execute non-query I will write the code
09:13 - to transfer my data from my database to
09:17 - the datag grid view so first thing I
09:20 - will declare here
09:23 - is uh sqi data adopter so
09:28 - write
09:29 - skite data adopter and give it a name I
09:33 - name it as
09:36 - data ADP for example is equal to
09:42 - new escal data adopter and bracket and
09:46 - bracket
09:47 - closed and in here in
09:50 - this bracket you need to pass your
09:54 - escolite command so just copy this
09:56 - escolite command and pass it
09:59 - here in between this adopter
10:03 - brackets now in the second
10:06 - line we will declare a variable for the
10:10 - data table so we
10:13 - write
10:15 - data
10:17 - table DT is equal to
10:22 - new data table bracket and bracket
10:25 - closed and what table we want to show in
10:29 - our data grid view U we want to show
10:34 - this table which is there in esite which
10:38 - whose name is employee info so in my
10:41 - database my table name is employee info
10:44 - I copy the name of the
10:48 - table and in this bracket I give double
10:52 - quotes and inside my double code I give
10:55 - the name of the table in the database
10:58 - okay
11:01 - now what I will do in next
11:05 - is I copy my data adopter variable here
11:09 - paste it here and I will fill this data
11:13 - with I will fill this data adopter with
11:16 - my data table so I write this dot
11:22 - fill bracket and bracket closed and I
11:26 - pass this data table VAR able inside
11:32 - this fill argument
11:35 - okay now in the next line what we are
11:39 - going to do is we will transfer this
11:43 - table to the datag grid view so go to
11:46 - your main window select your data grid
11:51 - from here and copy the name of the datag
11:53 - grid
11:55 - view so just copy this datag grid 1 in
11:58 - my cas case this is the name of this
12:01 - datag grid so just copy this name go to
12:06 - the code section and below
12:10 - your data adopter do fill code just
12:14 - paste the name of your data
12:17 - grid and write
12:23 - dot
12:25 - item
12:27 - source is equal
12:29 - to copy this DT variable once
12:33 - again and then write
12:39 - dot default
12:42 - view bracket and bracket
12:46 - closed I think this will not come here
12:50 - okay so we passed
12:54 - our data table value which we are are
12:59 - taking it from the database into the
13:01 - datag grid View and what we are going to
13:04 - do is we will update our data grid once
13:08 - again so what you want have to do is
13:11 - just copy this data adopter variable
13:14 - from
13:15 - here and paste it here once again
13:20 - dot
13:24 - update and in this bracket pass the
13:27 - argument d for data
13:30 - table okay so this is the
13:35 - code
13:39 - for loading the database value in the
13:45 - data Grid or table so if you want you
13:49 - can pause the video and just copy
13:52 - it and now we are going to run this
13:56 - program so let's run it
14:01 - I have username and
14:04 - password and it opens the second form
14:08 - and when I click this load
14:12 - table
14:13 - my Eid name surname and age column
14:17 - should appear here and all the data in
14:20 - that so let's try I click it and Bam all
14:26 - the data in the database comes in my
14:30 - data grid view so let's check if the
14:33 - data is correct this is
14:36 - my skite database data and this is my
14:41 - WPF
14:42 - application so you just
14:45 - check all the
14:47 - data which is here in the database is
14:50 - also
14:51 - here so in this way you can connect your
14:56 - data grid with your or
15:00 - database so I hope you have enjoyed this
15:02 - video please rate comment and subscribe
15:04 - and bye for now
