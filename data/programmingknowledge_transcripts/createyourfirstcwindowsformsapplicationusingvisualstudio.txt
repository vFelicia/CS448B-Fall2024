00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can create your first
00:03 - Windows Form application since C sharp
00:06 - on your Visual Studio
00:08 - so let's get started and let's see how
00:10 - we can do it
00:11 - so when you open Visual Studio it will
00:14 - look like this here we are going to
00:17 - create a new project so just click on
00:20 - create a new project
00:22 - and then here either you can search for
00:25 - Windows Form application or you can just
00:28 - select these drop Doms and select C
00:30 - sharp here and the platform will be
00:33 - desktop so you can just select windows
00:38 - for example and then you can choose the
00:42 - all project type and the project type
00:44 - here is desktop and from here you can
00:49 - see two Windows Form app options so here
00:53 - we can select this option which is
00:56 - Windows Form app using.net core so just
01:00 - select this option and then click on
01:02 - next
01:03 - on the next window you can give the name
01:06 - of your project I'm going to name my
01:08 - project as my first project for example
01:13 - and you can see I don't like to give
01:16 - spaces in the project name so if
01:19 - possible just write or give a project
01:22 - name without spaces right and then click
01:25 - on next
01:26 - and here the framework will be dot net
01:29 - 6.0 or whatever is the latest version of
01:33 - dotnet in my case it's dotnet 6.0 click
01:37 - on create
01:39 - and this is going to create a Windows
01:42 - Form application in c-sharp for you so
01:45 - now you can see my project has been
01:47 - created
01:48 - you will be able to see this kind of
01:51 - solution on the left hand side and on
01:54 - the right hand side you can see this
01:57 - form one dot CS file so this is the
02:00 - program file where you will write the
02:03 - program
02:04 - now how you can open the designer you
02:06 - can see this form one dot CS file right
02:10 - and when you just expand this you will
02:14 - be able to see C sharp form One Design
02:16 - also here right so when you double click
02:19 - on this form one dot CS file it's also
02:22 - going to open the designer for you so
02:24 - just wait for the designer to load for
02:27 - this form one so now you can see this
02:30 - form one dot CS design window is open
02:34 - you can resize
02:36 - this form one window here you can even
02:41 - give the title to it right now the title
02:44 - here is form one you can change the text
02:47 - of this let's say you want to change the
02:50 - text to uh my app and then press enter
02:56 - the title has been changed to my app
02:59 - right so you can change the text for
03:03 - your form by just changing the title
03:07 - here you have all the other options to
03:10 - change the appearance of your form or
03:14 - you can even change the font size
03:16 - if you are using some fonts in your form
03:20 - or you can also change the behavior of
03:24 - your form so you can drag and drop some
03:28 - components in your form from the toolbox
03:30 - so if you don't see the toolbox just
03:33 - click on this toolbox option here which
03:35 - is going to load all the toolbox if you
03:39 - want to pin the toolbox
03:41 - window you can just click on pin and to
03:45 - box window will be pinned here so you
03:47 - can easily drag and drop all the
03:50 - components from here
03:52 - so you can see
03:54 - all Windows Form components you can see
03:57 - buttons labels and other components
04:00 - I'm going to use a button so I'm going
04:04 - to just drag and drop this button into
04:08 - my form I can even use the label so I
04:12 - can drag and drop this label into my
04:15 - form
04:16 - and let me also use the text box so let
04:21 - me search for
04:23 - this text box and put it here okay
04:27 - so I can
04:29 - you can see a drag and drop all these
04:32 - components here now for this label
04:36 - I can change the label text
04:39 - from this
04:41 - properties window so the text here is
04:45 - label one I can just write
04:48 - enter some text for example or enter
04:51 - your value because I want the user to
04:54 - enter something into the text box right
04:57 - so I'm going to just write enter
05:00 - some
05:02 - text here and then press enter and you
05:04 - can see this label shows that I will
05:08 - just drag this text box here also
05:12 - and now
05:14 - in the behavior you will be able to see
05:17 - uh all these Behavior options
05:21 - I want to change the anchor option here
05:24 - so you can see the anchor is right now
05:27 - top and left I can even
05:32 - click on this option to Anchor it to the
05:35 - right side so what it's going to do is
05:38 - let me just
05:40 - resize it according to my form
05:44 - and I can even
05:48 - do the same for this label but I do not
05:50 - need this for the label
05:53 - so what I it's going to do is when I
05:55 - anchor it to the right when I resize my
05:58 - window you can see
06:00 - the text box resizes right
06:03 - same I can do with the button also so
06:08 - this button text says button one I'm
06:10 - going to just change it to
06:14 - click me for example
06:17 - and then press enter and you can see the
06:19 - button text is changed
06:21 - I can even change the anchor for it so
06:25 - right now it's top left I can anchor it
06:28 - to the right and then I can just move it
06:32 - here and
06:34 - then just resize my button
06:38 - until it shows this kind of
06:43 - line here right
06:45 - so now
06:46 - when I even resize my window it's going
06:52 - to uh
06:53 - just resize according to the width of my
06:58 - frame right I can even anchor this
07:01 - button to the bottom so that
07:04 - it moves to the bottom lets see how can
07:07 - we do that so I can anchor it to the
07:09 - bottom and then
07:12 - what happens is when I just make it
07:15 - bigger this button size becomes bigger
07:18 - for example right so this is how you can
07:20 - change the behavior so you need to play
07:22 - with all these options and see what you
07:25 - can do so for example I can change the
07:27 - background color from here
07:29 - so here I have all these options for
07:34 - changing the background color
07:36 - let's say I want to just choose this one
07:39 - and then you can see the background
07:41 - color of my form has been changed and
07:46 - the background color of my button also
07:48 - has been changed
07:50 - so now let's write some code so what I
07:53 - want to do here is whenever some text is
07:56 - entered into this text box and when I
08:00 - click the button I want to open a
08:03 - message box with the same text for
08:07 - example right so
08:09 - the main thing to note here is the name
08:12 - of this text box so when I select this
08:15 - text box the name of the text box is
08:18 - text box one so for using this name I'm
08:22 - going to use this text box text and show
08:27 - the text on the message box for example
08:31 - right so just copy this ah name from
08:36 - here and then select your click me
08:40 - button just double click on this button
08:42 - which is going to
08:44 - create a listener for your button right
08:47 - so the button name was Button one you
08:51 - can even verify that by going here and
08:55 - then you can see the name of this button
08:59 - you can see the name of the button is
09:01 - button one and the method which is
09:04 - created is button one click listener
09:07 - right so let me just write some code I'm
09:11 - going to create a
09:12 - string variable I am going to name it as
09:16 - text is equal to and I am going to take
09:20 - the name of my text box right which was
09:24 - text box one so I'm going to just write
09:27 - Dot
09:28 - text which is going to uh
09:31 - give me the text whatever I write in the
09:34 - text box it's going to just take the
09:36 - text and assign it to the text variable
09:39 - right now I want to show this text into
09:42 - a message box so I can just use a
09:47 - message box component just write
09:50 - message box
09:53 - dot show
09:55 - and then
09:56 - I can just write
10:00 - U entered and then semicolon space and
10:05 - then plus and then the text variable
10:09 - which is text okay once you are done
10:12 - just save your code and then you can run
10:16 - your code by just clicking on this run
10:19 - Icon so I'm going to run my code
10:23 - and hopefully everything works fine you
10:25 - can see my code is running
10:28 - when I resize you can see the button and
10:31 - the text box resizes according to the
10:33 - size when I move down the button size is
10:37 - changed right now let me enter something
10:40 - so I'm going to just write
10:43 - Dom here and then I'm going to click on
10:46 - click me button and it says you entered
10:49 - Dom right I can just write 34 here and
10:55 - I'm going to just click on click me and
10:58 - it says you entered 34 okay
11:02 - so it is going to open this message box
11:04 - every time when I click on the button
11:07 - and it's going to show whatever text I
11:09 - wrote here
11:11 - so this is the basic Foundation of how
11:15 - you can create a Windows Form
11:17 - application in Visual Studio using C
11:21 - sharp and create your forms and use your
11:25 - forms in Windows Form application so I
11:30 - hope you've enjoyed this video and I
11:32 - will see you in the next video
