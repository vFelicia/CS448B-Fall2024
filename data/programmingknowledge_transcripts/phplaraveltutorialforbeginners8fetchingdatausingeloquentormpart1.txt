00:00 - alright guys welcome back to our YouTube
00:01 - channel and welcome to this video this
00:04 - is the part 8 of the Lara blog for
00:06 - beginners tutorial and in this video
00:09 - we're going to discuss how to fetch data
00:13 - with Luke rent and also we're going to
00:16 - populate our database by use by using
00:19 - the tinker command and in order for us
00:23 - to do that let's open or integrate the
00:25 - terminal of our atom editor so in order
00:29 - for us to do that is we have to press
00:31 - shift alt and T and there you go we have
00:36 - opened our integrated terminal and in
00:39 - here we can type we can run the tinker
00:42 - commands from here and also we can
00:45 - populate our database by using the
00:48 - tinker so all we have to do now is type
00:52 - in PHP artisan and then tinker and as
00:58 - you can see we have here the brackets
01:00 - that let us know that we are inside the
01:03 - tinker program and from here we can
01:07 - directly work with our database and
01:09 - directly work with our models so for now
01:14 - let's bring in the post model so app and
01:18 - backslash and then post and then we can
01:22 - have a function in here so for example
01:26 - count and it will return zero which
01:29 - means we don't have yet a post in our
01:33 - post table or post model so now let's
01:38 - create a new instance of our post so in
01:40 - order for us to do that is define the
01:42 - variable dollar sign post and then equal
01:46 - sign and then our in model and then new
01:51 - app backslash and then post then
01:56 - semicolon
01:57 - and make sure you have the backslash
02:00 - instead of forward slash so this will be
02:03 - the backslash and enter so now we have a
02:10 - instance or an instance of our post
02:13 - so it is being saved in our memory and
02:16 - by that we can use that in order for us
02:21 - to move forward and add a post to our
02:24 - post table so now we can use the post
02:27 - instance and then set the title for our
02:31 - first post so let's just make it the
02:35 - title into post one and then semicolon
02:39 - there we go and then of course for our
02:42 - post body let's just do the same for our
02:47 - post body so this is this is the post
02:54 - body semicolon and then there you go
02:59 - this is the post body and then after
03:02 - that one we can save this save the
03:07 - information for our title and our body
03:10 - so post and then save and then enter and
03:16 - it returned it returns true which means
03:20 - that we have saved a certain post to our
03:24 - post table now if we try to check our
03:27 - database inside our PHP myadmin we can
03:31 - see here that we have a post and of
03:33 - course we have the first post which is
03:37 - which has the idea of one that I tell we
03:40 - have set this into post one and of
03:43 - course we have set the body content this
03:47 - is the post body and it also have the
03:51 - created at and updated at fields which
03:54 - is automatically populated for us so
03:57 - let's try to add another one and first
04:00 - let us create a new instance of our post
04:05 - model so new and then app backslash and
04:09 - then post this will create another
04:12 - instance and then we're going to set the
04:17 - title for this this is post two and the
04:24 - post body also we need
04:27 - to set a value for this this is the
04:32 - second post body there you go and we
04:39 - will say finally we will save this
04:42 - values so our database so it returns
04:49 - true again which means that we have now
04:53 - have to post in our post table in our
04:57 - database so refresh here and then you
05:02 - can see we have two posts or two records
05:06 - of our post table so post two and then
05:10 - this is the second post body with D
05:12 - created at and updated at fields now if
05:16 - you try to go back into our project and
05:20 - if you want to add a functionality here
05:23 - for our create read update and delete
05:26 - we're going to need to have different
05:29 - functions and different routes in our
05:32 - laravel project so let's go back to our
05:35 - code editor and try to edit our post
05:39 - controller let us open our post
05:44 - controller and as you can see here it is
05:47 - pretty much empty for now so in order
05:51 - for us to add the functionality for our
05:53 - create read update and delete I think
05:56 - we're gonna need functions or several
05:58 - functions from here so we need the first
06:02 - one is index so it is just a way of
06:05 - listing all our posts from our database
06:07 - another one is create and I'm just going
06:12 - to type it in here you don't need to
06:15 - follow this time so store to actually
06:19 - save our data into our database and then
06:23 - we have the function to add it and also
06:27 - we have a function that should be
06:30 - updating our data and of course we have
06:34 - also show and of course the last one too
06:40 - delete our record from our database so
06:45 - we could actually create this functions
06:49 - manually but we'll try to create this by
06:55 - using some commands so I think I haven't
06:58 - shown you this yet so I think I just
07:02 - have to delete this post controller for
07:06 - now and generate another one so I have
07:15 - deleted the post controller for now and
07:20 - I'm going to generate it again by using
07:26 - some commands so in order for us to do
07:28 - that let's run the command PHP artisan
07:33 - and then make and then controller and of
07:42 - course the name of our controller is
07:44 - post controller with s post controller
07:48 - and then we're just gonna add the
07:51 - resource keyword here and then we're
07:54 - just going to wait for a few seconds to
07:56 - allow the generation of our controller
08:00 - so there you go controller generate that
08:04 - are created successfully and if we try
08:06 - to open up the new post controller we
08:10 - can see that all the functions that we
08:13 - have listed earlier has been generated
08:17 - successfully so we have here the
08:19 - function index so display a listing of
08:22 - the resource and some of the functions
08:25 - here don't need or doesn't need the
08:30 - parameters but there are also functions
08:33 - that need the parameter so say for
08:38 - example this one we have D create so
08:41 - show the form for creating a new
08:43 - resource and then the store has this
08:46 - parameter request and we're going to
08:50 - define some of the logic later on in
08:54 - this function and also we have the show
08:56 - so it has the ID that will identify the
09:01 - record that we want to show here and
09:03 - also we have the edit the same thing it
09:05 - has the ID parameter and also we have
09:09 - the update that requires two parameters
09:13 - the request and of course the ID of the
09:16 - resource and of course the destroy
09:19 - function that will enable us to delete
09:23 - based on the ID of the resource so now
09:27 - that we have laid out all these
09:29 - functions in our controller we need to
09:31 - have a route for each functions right so
09:38 - we're going to add or we're going to go
09:40 - to the web page P of our routes and as
09:46 - you can see we have here the route that
09:49 - we have currently and if you try to go
09:51 - to our command or our terminal let's try
09:54 - to list our routes for now so PHP
09:58 - artisan and then route and then list so
10:04 - these are the currently generated routes
10:08 - for our project so as you can see we
10:10 - have here drag in the home the password
10:14 - the register and all other functions or
10:17 - all other routes that we have set and
10:20 - now let's try to add a route for all our
10:26 - functions because it is a kind of pain
10:29 - in the ass if you try to generate
10:32 - individual routes for our functions
10:37 - right so let's try to generate route for
10:40 - all our resource in our post controller
10:44 - so route and then resource and of course
10:51 - the name will be post and of course
10:58 - the name of our controller which is post
11:01 - controller and then we're going to save
11:05 - this for now save and then let's go back
11:08 - to our terminal and try to run another
11:10 - one PHP artisan and then route and then
11:21 - list so let's try to find our resource
11:27 - or generate that routes for our post
11:30 - controller so as you can see we have
11:32 - here all the the routes related to our
11:36 - post controller so we have here the post
11:39 - store post index post create post show
11:44 - and of course post update and all other
11:48 - functions or all other routes that we
11:51 - that we need in our post controller and
11:54 - I think that's it for this particular
11:57 - video and in the next video we're going
11:59 - to continue working on with our fetching
12:01 - data with Lucan so we're working with
12:03 - the create read update and delete so see
12:08 - you in the next video
