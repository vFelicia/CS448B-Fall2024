00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to uh add analog and digital clock
00:11 - widget to your Android activity and we
00:15 - are also going to make a small little
00:17 - app uh of uh these analog and digital
00:23 - clock widget so that uh on the basis of
00:26 - button click we can decide which clock
00:30 - we want to display so um just go to your
00:35 - Widgets or pallet and in here you will
00:38 - see the category called date and time
00:41 - and in here you will see analog and
00:43 - digital clock there is one more type of
00:46 - clock which is called text clock uh it
00:50 - works almost similar to the digital
00:53 - clocks so if you know how to use digital
00:56 - clock you will be able
00:58 - to uh you know work with this text clock
01:02 - also so in this video I will just take
01:05 - analog and digital clock but you can
01:07 - also use uh text clock in a similar way
01:12 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
01:13 - drag and drop this analog clock widget
01:16 - first and digital clock
01:19 - widget okay and then what I'm going to
01:24 - do is I'm going to take a button and on
01:28 - this button click event
01:30 - what I'm going to do is I am going to
01:34 - show or I'm going to display or the
01:38 - widget on Alternate uh button click so I
01:43 - can uh name my uh Button
01:48 - as
01:51 - swap clock for example okay now all
01:55 - three widgets are here so I can go to my
01:58 - Java file which is main activity. Java
02:02 - and in
02:04 - here I'm going to uh add these three
02:09 - variables for the button clock which is
02:13 - analog clock and digital
02:28 - clock
02:38 - so now all uh these variables are
02:42 - created now we just need to write a
02:46 - method on this button click which can
02:50 - swap these clocks so we are going to
02:54 - write the
02:57 - method
02:58 - public void
03:04 - on
03:05 - button
03:09 - click listener for example no argument
03:13 - we are going to
03:14 - pass
03:16 - and in here we will uh cast these three
03:20 - variables once again
03:28 - so
03:44 - so now we have casted our three
03:47 - variables and now we will add The
03:50 - Listener to our button variables so I
03:54 - will just take this button submit
03:57 - variable and we will add set
04:00 - onclick listener to this button and
04:03 - inside the set onclick listener we will
04:05 - set a new onclick listener okay and
04:11 - inside this onclick method what we are
04:14 - going to do is we are going to check
04:17 - this uh digital clock so if this
04:22 - Digital Dot
04:28 - get
04:30 - visibility and if uh it's this digital
04:35 - class
04:37 - dot
04:39 - gone then we will make it
04:43 - visible so in our if condition we will
04:47 - make our
04:50 - digital clock visible so digital do
04:56 - set
04:58 - visibility and we will make it visible
05:01 - so digital
05:04 - clock
05:07 - dot visible okay at the same time we
05:11 - will uh you know set the visibility of
05:14 - analog log clock to gone okay so analog
05:19 - clock or analog do set
05:23 - visibility and analog
05:26 - clock dot gone else we will do the
05:31 - Opposites okay so
05:34 - else and in here we will do just the
05:38 - opposite of uh this action which is we
05:42 - are going to disable digital clock and
05:46 - make visible the analog clock okay now
05:51 - we just need to uh call this method
05:54 - inside our on
05:57 - create method and now we are going to
06:00 - run our program so now our app is
06:03 - running You Can See For the First Time
06:06 - both clocks are visible and they uh
06:10 - dynamically runs so if uh here the time
06:15 - changes this clock uh time also changes
06:19 - okay now let's check the functionality
06:22 - of this button so when I click swap
06:25 - clock this uh digital clock is not
06:29 - active but analog clock is active right
06:32 - now once again I will uh click swap
06:35 - clock and now my digital clock is active
06:38 - and analog clock disappears right so on
06:42 - this button click one clock appears and
06:46 - other clock disappears right so in this
06:50 - way you can uh use this analog clock and
06:55 - digital clock in your Android activity I
06:57 - hope you enjoyed this video please wait
06:59 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
