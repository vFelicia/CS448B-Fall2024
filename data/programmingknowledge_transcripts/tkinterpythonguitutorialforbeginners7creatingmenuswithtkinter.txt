00:01 - hello guys and welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge on the previous video we
00:05 - learned about the inter message box or
00:08 - showing information and how to use check
00:11 - boxes and radio buttons and print their
00:15 - user given outputs in this console so
00:18 - this is output from the previous video
00:21 - and in this video it is a continuation
00:25 - so in this video we'll be learning about
00:27 - how to create menu menu bar basically so
00:30 - this part how to create that into a
00:35 - kinder window so I'll just show the
00:38 - output of the previous video so how you
00:40 - can put a menu bar over here so let's
00:44 - get into it
00:46 - so for a minim by you just need to type
00:50 - in and that is create a variable menu is
00:59 - equal to main this is a inbuilt option
01:05 - so we come as and default passing this
01:08 - variable which we have taken and root
01:13 - dot config okay and menu is equal to men
01:18 - oh so this is like a very fine that the
01:21 - variable which we have taken for the
01:23 - menu widget is equal to that variable
01:28 - itself so menu again okay so these are
01:33 - two lines which you required just to
01:35 - create a bar over here on the top of the
01:38 - inter window widget so now to create
01:42 - multiple options within it I'll just
01:44 - space it down a bit
01:45 - okay so create a multiple options within
01:49 - that create another variable menu or a
01:56 - create a sub menu sub m1 is equal to sub
02:04 - m1 is equal to the menu itself the main
02:08 - arm parent object menu
02:13 - and it is this the function which we are
02:18 - going to use right now is a inbuilt
02:21 - method so menu dot add cascade okay and
02:28 - providing a unable to its own label is
02:33 - equal to what you want to provide file
02:37 - right so usually over here you can see
02:41 - file edit of view navigate so this file
02:44 - is over here the label name so five and
02:50 - currently we are not providing any
02:52 - functionality to that so just close it
02:56 - it's already and if you want to provide
03:04 - something within that file menu use sub
03:08 - m 1 which is the above variable dot add
03:17 - underscore come on which is over here
03:19 - and label X a label this is equal to
03:29 - exit so I will show the output so to
03:34 - remove here so there is some error so I
03:41 - was mistaken over here that the widget
03:47 - of widget variable which we are using
03:49 - should have the parent kinder window so
03:52 - here instead of malobi I using the loop
03:54 - so it gets attached to the main window
03:59 - window so let's run this now so as you
04:05 - can see the output here is the menu bar
04:11 - but you can't see the exit option right
04:16 - now right
04:19 - as it is not there the file has been
04:22 - created right okay so it's move on to
04:27 - the method that is how you can add that
04:34 - exit which is over here into or below
04:37 - the file for example this is the main
04:40 - and if you want to add a new project or
04:43 - something like this
04:43 - exit how you can do that right so this
04:48 - create menu as an argument for that and
04:51 - pass sub M that's it now we'll see the
04:59 - output will move here so file and exit
05:06 - okay so you have created a successful
05:10 - minnow option now we just copied this
05:15 - one and create another one okay just
05:21 - rename it will be using attached to some
05:27 - m2 we are also change it to yes to
05:33 - change over here as well and name it as
05:36 - option option and set as about so hmm
05:50 - let's see the output okay here we have
05:53 - to add it as to now that is good so we
06:00 - have created two file options that is
06:02 - file with exit and fun with about so
06:05 - this is basically how you can create a a
06:08 - menu widget or a menu fail within a
06:11 - kinder window with the sub options as
06:14 - well right okay so now basically now we
06:19 - we need to provide a command
06:21 - so that is for exit so if I click on to
06:26 - exit I want to exit the and tack in dog
06:29 - window it so comma
06:33 - command is equal to exit okay but the
06:51 - exit method is down over here right just
06:57 - cut this and place it over here at the
07:04 - top so it will detect now so there is
07:12 - gone and for same I will do this for
07:17 - about comma will provide a command is
07:21 - equal to abt now we have to create a
07:28 - message box that is wait define abt that
07:34 - is a function which we have mentioned
07:36 - over here and the about come on and and
07:46 - just use a kingdom message box to show
07:49 - how it works
07:51 - dot message box thought show in for
08:01 - and provide the title as the first
08:05 - argument welcome to authors comma this
08:18 - is demo for many fields ok so this looks
08:33 - good and let's sit on this now all right
08:41 - Umberto I guess we have some kind of
08:44 - error oh yeah show info ok so what is a
08:55 - error right so just look into it and
09:02 - I'll just tell you what is the error so
09:06 - oh here we just don't need to do this
09:08 - this is fine I guess
09:12 - ok so the error has gone so these are
09:16 - the two options that is filed with exit
09:20 - and menu option with AB all right so
09:23 - let's click to exit so as you can see
09:27 - the window is excited so the kamala
09:31 - which we have provided that is exit has
09:33 - been executed successfully via this
09:36 - argument command and let's see for the
09:41 - option for about option and about so now
09:48 - put is successful this is a title
09:50 - welcome to authors and this is a demo
09:53 - for many fields ok so this is a message
09:55 - box enter message box so so this is a
10:00 - basic approach of creating a menu phase
10:02 - within a kinto window
10:04 - or you can use as many as options you
10:08 - need and create submenu within it and
10:11 - provide commands to it using this
10:15 - method so it is just like a button with
10:19 - this command approach so this was it for
10:22 - this video guys in this video we have
10:24 - learned about how to create menu fields
10:27 - within the kinder window yeah thanks for
10:30 - watching
10:39 - you
