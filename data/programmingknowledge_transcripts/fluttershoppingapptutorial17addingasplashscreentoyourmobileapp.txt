00:00 - so as i said in the previous video in
00:02 - this video we shall
00:04 - start with developing the flutter part
00:06 - so before we dive right into the code i
00:08 - just want to open figma
00:10 - and show you a few things so uh i added
00:13 - two new screens okay and i'll tell you
00:16 - how the flow is gonna be so for
00:19 - means prototyping means deciding how the
00:22 - flow is gonna be we need to go in the
00:24 - prototyping section
00:25 - okay then from here everything is very
00:27 - simple i select this
00:28 - screen now if i want now if this screen
00:32 - is clicked
00:33 - i want to go on the seller screen so
00:35 - what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna select
00:37 - this
00:37 - big white circle and drag it to the
00:40 - screen
00:41 - to the next screen where i want it to go
00:44 - okay now over here i have many options
00:46 - to choose i am just
00:48 - gonna make it smart animate okay
00:52 - now so this is done so now what will
00:53 - happen then that if we click on this
00:55 - screen in figma preview we will be taken
00:58 - to this
00:58 - screen and now over here if i click on
01:02 - this
01:02 - item i want to go on the product screen
01:05 - so that is how our flow is gonna be
01:07 - that if i click on any of the seller i
01:10 - will be able to see all
01:12 - the products that that seller has okay
01:15 - and then after that if any of the
01:17 - product is clicked
01:20 - then we will for sure go to its uh
01:22 - product details
01:24 - okay so with this our very basic
01:26 - prototyping is done
01:28 - let's see
01:33 - okay so now if i click on this screen i
01:36 - am taken
01:36 - to the category screen and you
01:40 - saw how the better bias which was in
01:42 - center flew to the top left
01:44 - corner this is called hero animation and
01:46 - we shall be doing it
01:48 - okay and then after that if i click on
01:50 - this i am taken to the
01:52 - product screen and now if i click on any
01:54 - of the products
01:55 - i am able to see its details so this
01:59 - is what our flow is gonna be for now so
02:01 - let's
02:03 - open uh vs code and start coding
02:07 - okay so first i'll create a new project
02:19 - i'm gonna write flutter create
02:23 - better buys
02:26 - so this will create a flutter project
02:28 - with the name better buys
02:31 - okay so this will take a few seconds
02:34 - and in the meantime i have opened my
02:36 - emulator
02:38 - uh you can open your simulator um
02:42 - or you can connect your real device with
02:45 - it
02:46 - okay so now once this is built i'll open
02:49 - this folder
02:50 - okay means this project
03:02 - okay
03:08 - okay so once it is open i'll simply
03:11 - start building it
03:15 - okay so in main dot dot
03:19 - over here we have all the starting code
03:22 - okay so i'll go to run run without
03:24 - debugging
03:28 - and now it has started running so this
03:30 - is the
03:31 - initial project that flutter comes with
03:35 - if i click on this the value is gonna
03:37 - change over here so we are gonna remove
03:39 - this
03:39 - and directly start with our splash
03:43 - screen so i'll remove all the
03:45 - unnecessary code
03:47 - this complete my home it is not required
03:54 - okay now i'll remove this comments as
03:57 - well
03:59 - and i also want to remove this debug
04:02 - mode banner that we have over here
04:05 - so for that we have a key value property
04:09 - called debug show checked mode banner
04:12 - i am going to make it false
04:17 - okay and after this i'm gonna create a
04:21 - new folder inside my lib folder
04:23 - okay that is gonna be screens okay and
04:26 - then inside this i'm gonna create a new
04:29 - file that is gonna be
04:31 - splash screen dot dot
04:35 - okay so now this screen is created over
04:37 - here i'll import the
04:39 - flutter material so import
04:44 - material dot flutter a dot dot i'm sorry
04:54 - okay then after that i'll create a
04:56 - stateless widget
04:58 - okay that is gonna be called splash
05:02 - screen okay then instead of returning a
05:05 - container we are gonna return a scaffold
05:08 - because every screen should have a
05:10 - scaffold then
05:12 - a scaffold has a home okay
05:15 - so now the home is gonna be a container
05:23 - and inside the container we are gonna
05:26 - have a child
05:28 - and the child is gonna be text and the
05:30 - text is
05:32 - splash screen okay so this is done
05:42 - okay
05:47 - so i don't know why it is giving another
05:55 - okay so it doesn't have a home but it
05:57 - has a body i am extremely sorry for that
06:03 - okay so the body is gonna be a container
06:07 - okay and now we have this i'm gonna
06:10 - import it in our main dot dot and add it
06:13 - in the home so that
06:14 - as soon as the app starts we are able to
06:16 - see this screen which is
06:18 - in turn our splash screen so to import
06:21 - any local files
06:23 - the standard practices if you leave a
06:25 - line and use
06:27 - referential operator okay so
06:30 - i'm gonna write import dot slash
06:33 - and that is the instance of this class
06:36 - then inside this we in
06:38 - this folder i'm sorry then inside this
06:39 - we have the screens folder
06:41 - and then we have the splash screen
06:44 - okay and now over here instead of my
06:47 - home page it is gonna be
06:51 - splash screen
06:55 - okay so this is done
06:58 - and now over here instead of this i am
07:01 - gonna use an
07:02 - arrow operator
07:05 - okay because that is better and that is
07:08 - also
07:08 - recommended so this is done let's save
07:14 - this
07:18 - okay so once this is complete we can see
07:21 - splash screen but it is in the
07:24 - top left corner and it is almost hidden
07:26 - by the notch
07:27 - okay so we'll fix so that is not an
07:29 - issue but
07:30 - we got to see that our screen is intact
07:34 - okay so let's see the design the first
07:37 - thing we notice is the background color
07:39 - so
07:40 - let's get back to design so i'm gonna
07:43 - get this color and that is this okay
07:46 - so now inside our splash screen
07:50 - the container has a parameter called
07:53 - color
07:54 - okay and then it will take a color color
07:57 - class
07:58 - and then i can simply write the code of
08:00 - the color so now what happens is that
08:02 - this color requires a hexadecimal
08:06 - now even though it is a hexadecimal the
08:08 - color will
08:09 - color class will read it as a string
08:12 - okay so to convert so to make the color
08:15 - class read it as an
08:16 - hexadecimal all we need to do is add 0
08:20 - x f okay so this f stands for
08:23 - opacity and this is the format in which
08:27 - this color understands okay so now if i
08:30 - save this this color should be applied
08:31 - on our screen
08:32 - so let's see
08:37 - okay and it is only applied to this part
08:40 - i'm sorry
08:43 - i'll remove this now let's see
08:48 - and the color is applied to the entire
08:50 - screen okay now in center we need a
08:53 - better vice in text
08:54 - okay so for that i'm gonna have a child
08:58 - and the child is a text the text says
09:01 - better bias okay and the text
09:06 - should be in the center so for that i'm
09:07 - gonna write alignment
09:10 - and then from the alignment enum
09:16 - i am gonna use center
09:20 - okay so this is done let's save this
09:25 - and now we can see better vice in the
09:27 - center well although
09:29 - this font and color is very different
09:31 - from what we have here so you can see
09:33 - the font we have over here is pacifico
09:36 - okay so now to add this font in our
09:39 - project we are gonna use a package that
09:41 - is
09:41 - google fonts package
09:45 - okay so for that i'm gonna write to
09:47 - google fonts
09:49 - flutter so this will take us to the
09:52 - package
09:53 - i'm extremely sorry okay so i'm
09:56 - extremely sorry for that so the first
09:58 - link that is pub.dev
10:00 - has this package that is google fonts
10:03 - okay so
10:04 - i'm gonna copy it and simply paste it in
10:07 - my pubspec.yaml file
10:11 - so in pubspec.tml inside dependencies
10:16 - i'll place this and save this and then
10:18 - pub get should automatically start
10:20 - running and it did
10:22 - okay so this is the package that we are
10:24 - going to use we can use this to add any
10:26 - kind of font all we need to do is
10:28 - in the style inside text widget we just
10:32 - need to write google fonts
10:33 - and the font name okay so the proper
10:37 - instructions of
10:37 - installing is over here okay and this is
10:40 - the package that we add
10:42 - so i copied it
10:45 - will have to wait for a few seconds for
10:47 - this to complete running
10:50 - so once this is done we will open our
10:52 - splash
10:53 - screen and over here i'll simply paste
10:56 - it
10:58 - so now let's apply the pacifico font in
11:00 - our text
11:02 - so simply we are gonna go here write a
11:05 - style and then
11:07 - google fonts dot pasi
11:12 - fico
11:15 - okay so now let's
11:19 - wait for this google phone to recognize
11:21 - pacifico because it runs on real time in
11:24 - the
11:24 - on the internet so it will take a few
11:27 - moments
11:30 - okay so once it has recognized let's
11:33 - save this nc
11:40 - ok so now you can see once it has
11:42 - completed we
11:43 - get a bunch of errors over here and that
11:46 - is because we added a package and didn't
11:49 - restart it so the next time when we
11:52 - restart it
11:52 - so or just start it we will not
11:56 - be seeing these errors but anyways the
11:59 - font is applied now we just need to
12:01 - change the color and its
12:03 - size so for that inside this we have a
12:06 - property called color
12:10 - okay and that takes a color
12:14 - now again we need to get the color from
12:16 - our sigma file so i'll simply copy this
12:20 - paste it over here and and the color
12:24 - class will not understand so i'll have
12:26 - to add 0x
12:27 - for ff in front of it okay and then
12:30 - along with this i'll also change the
12:32 - size okay so the size is gonna be
12:36 - 20 let's see how it looks if it is not
12:39 - in accordance with our design we shall
12:41 - change it again
12:43 - so let's format it
12:47 - so once it is formatted let's save it
12:52 - okay and now you can see a better bias
12:55 - is here but it is
12:56 - very small i shall increase the size
12:59 - let's make it
13:00 - 25 okay so over here it is actually the
13:04 - pixels
13:05 - size okay so it can be a little bit more
13:08 - bigger
13:10 - let's make it 27 and
13:13 - this looks fine okay this is looking
13:16 - very aesthetical now
13:17 - in the next video we shall continue to
13:20 - the next screen
13:21 - okay so this was for the video thank you
