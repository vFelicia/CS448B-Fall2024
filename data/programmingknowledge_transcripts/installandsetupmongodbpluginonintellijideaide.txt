04:52 - told you to install mongodb first in
04:56 - order to provide the executable so once
04:59 - you have mongod DB installed in your uh
05:02 - you know Windows operating system then
05:04 - you will be able to browse for
05:07 - executable file so just click this three
05:10 - dots here and uh you know generally your
05:14 -  DB EXC you will be able to find in
05:18 - your C directory and in the C directory
05:20 - go to program files and in the program
05:24 - files you will be able to find this
05:26 - mongod DB which is this one mongodb
05:29 - folder
05:30 - and inside the mongodb folder you will
05:32 - be able to see Server and uh the version
05:36 - of mongodb and in the bin folder of
05:39 - mongod DB just expand this bin folder
05:42 - here and in the bin folder you will be
05:45 - able to see all these uh you know
05:47 - executable files the one we are
05:50 - interested in is this one which is
05:53 - do exe okay so just click this do
05:57 - exe and click okay and then you can text
06:01 - your uh you know mongodb exe by clicking
06:05 - this test button so just click this test
06:07 - button and if you see this green uh you
06:11 - know icon here then your test is
06:14 - successful and mongod DB is successfully
06:17 - you know configured on your intellig
06:21 - idea IDE right now what we need to do is
06:25 - we just need to define a server so just
06:28 - click this uh plus icon here and in here
06:32 - you just need to give the label to your
06:36 - uh you know server so for example I can
06:39 - just
06:40 - say Local Host for example okay and by
06:46 - default the server URL is already given
06:50 - here which is the default URL and you
06:53 - just need to leave everything as default
06:56 - you just need to give the name and then
06:58 - click okay okay okay so once you click
07:02 - okay then you uh can uh just click apply
07:07 - here and then click okay here
07:11 - okay now once you have done this you can
07:14 - just uh click this Local Host but first
07:17 - of all you need to uh start your mongod
07:21 - the uh you know demon in background so
07:26 - just open your command prompt and and
07:30 - then open your command prompt from here
07:34 - and once your command prompt is open we
07:36 - are going to run our mongod d. exe file
07:40 - so hopefully you have already configured
07:43 - your mongod D or and uh EXC uh you
07:49 - know environment variables so whenever
07:51 - you run Mong go d. exe and press enter
07:58 - it's going to run this mongod demon in
08:01 - background okay if uh you have recently
08:06 - you know installed uh mongod DB in your
08:09 - Windows operating system what you can do
08:11 - is you can just copy the path wherever
08:14 - your mongod DB is so go to C directory
08:17 - and then in here program
08:19 - files and here go to mongod DB server
08:24 - and then 3.2 then in the binary folder
08:28 - just copy this path from here and then
08:31 - once again open command prompt and then
08:34 - just do CD and then paste this path
08:37 - which you have copied which is C program
08:39 - files mongodb server 3.2 bin and press
08:43 - enter and then from here you can run
08:47 - this uh mongod d. exe command so just
08:50 - write
08:55 - D.E okay and press enter which is going
08:58 - to you know start this mongod D demon in
09:02 - background once this demon is running in
09:04 - background you can just select your uh
09:08 - Local Host and then just uh you can see
09:13 - your uh databases are listed here
09:17 - whatever databases are there in your uh
09:21 - you know DB now in order to work
09:24 - with these databases you need to open
09:28 - your uh you know shell in order to
09:31 - you know interact with these databases
09:34 - and provide some command and querying
09:37 - the databases right so the one option uh
09:41 - which uh you can use here is this
09:46 - shell option okay so just click this
09:49 -  shell and if uh it doesn't work
09:52 - then the second option here is just open
09:56 - your terminal which is on the bottom
09:58 - here so so you will be able to see
10:00 - terminal and 2 do here right so just
10:03 - open Terminal here and if you have a
10:07 -  DB uh you know path environment
10:10 - variable set then you can run here
10:14 - command so just write here so just
10:18 - give do exe or you can just give a
10:21 -  command here and press enter and
10:24 - it's going to open this shell in
10:27 - the terminal okay so it's going to open
10:30 - this shell in the terminal so we
10:32 - can just querying our uh database for
10:35 - example uh DB and then press enter it
10:39 - will give you the you know current DB we
10:42 - are in or we you can uh just give uh
10:47 - show DBS and press enter and it's going
10:50 - to give you the list of all DBS uh which
10:55 - are there in your uh database right so
10:58 - from this uh mongodb shell you can query
11:02 - your database or whatever you want to do
11:06 - you can do with this database right now
11:09 - let's create One DB here so to create a
11:12 - DB you just need to use this command
11:15 - which says use and your DB name so for
11:19 - example you can give the DB okay the DB
11:24 - name here okay and then press enter and
11:27 - it's going to create
11:29 - this database if it's not already
11:31 - present and if this database is already
11:34 - present then it will you know connect to
11:37 - this database now in order to insert
11:40 - some uh collection and some data in your
11:43 - database you just need to use this
11:45 - command which says DB then you need to
11:49 - give the collection name so for example
11:52 - my call for my collection
11:57 - dot insert
11:59 - and in the insert uh you just need to
12:02 - give the brackets so you just need to
12:07 - give the give these round brackets and
12:10 - in the round bracket just give these two
12:12 - curly brackets and in the curly bracket
12:15 - you can give some Json here so for
12:17 - example I'm going to just give a simple
12:20 - Json for example name and then colon
12:24 - some name so in the double quotes Mark
12:28 - for example
12:29 - okay and I'm going to press enter which
12:33 - says right result so it has written the
12:35 - result for us and then when we refresh
12:39 - uh this uh here then it's going to show
12:42 - this uh DB database here and it's going
12:46 - to show the you know collection here
12:49 - right now in order to query the database
12:52 - you just need to use this command DB do
12:55 - collection name so collection name is my
12:58 - co L and then you just need to give find
13:03 - and then press enter and it's going to
13:05 - show you whatever the data or document
13:09 - you have inserted into your collection
13:12 - right so in this way you can uh
13:15 - configure and set up mongod DB with your
13:18 - intellig IDE IDE I hope you enjoyed this
