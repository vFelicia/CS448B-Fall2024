00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last two videos I've been showing you
00:03 - how to uh create a PDF file using your
00:07 - itext shop D dll in your Visual Basic
00:10 - Windows Form application and in the last
00:13 - video I've shown you how to dra create a
00:16 - list in your PDF file and in this video
00:19 - I will show you how to uh add image in
00:22 - your PDF file using your Visual Basic
00:24 - Windows Form application and itex Shop
00:27 - dll so let's get started I have created
00:30 - this
00:31 - button already and I have
00:36 - already created this code to create a
00:40 - PDF file so if you don't know just watch
00:43 - the last two videos and you know how I
00:46 - made this uh code so this is I will just
00:50 - go through this code really fast this is
00:53 - a triy catch block and I'm catching any
00:57 - exception if it occurs and in
01:00 - the tri blog I'm just defining uh the
01:04 - variable called PDF doc as new document
01:09 - and in the second line I'm defining and
01:11 - giving my PDF file a name so I will
01:16 - write them PDF WR as PDF writer is equal
01:21 - to PDF writer. getet instance and in the
01:24 - bracket just pass the
01:26 - arguments this argument as a first
01:29 - argument
01:30 - and the second argument is the new file
01:33 - stream and in the bracket your file name
01:37 - or PDF file name which you want to give
01:39 - comma file mode do create okay and then
01:44 - we open the PDF doc to write in it so I
01:49 - will write PDF doc. open and then I have
01:52 - created the paragraph which I have
01:55 - already shown you how to create a
01:56 - paragraph in the PDF file so just write
01:58 - PDF doc add and in the bracket just
02:02 - write new paragraph show image and at
02:05 - the last before this sketch blog just
02:08 - close this PDF document by writing PDF
02:12 - doc. close and in between I will write
02:15 - the code
02:16 - to add an image so I have an image in my
02:22 - binary folder so when I click my
02:25 - solution Explorer I will go to Open
02:29 - folder in Windows Explorer and then I
02:32 - will go to bin folder where my debug
02:35 - folder is there and in here I have my
02:37 - executable file for my um for my project
02:41 - and here I've been creating the simple
02:45 - PDF and here I have a picture called VB
02:50 - 36 and when I open it you can see a
02:53 - picture and this picture I want to show
02:56 - in my PDF file okay so how can I do do
03:00 - this so in here just write the
03:05 - code this line so just create an
03:09 - variable of image so just write dim IMG
03:13 - this is the variable name as image is
03:16 - equal to image. getet instance and you
03:19 - are getting the instance from this PDF
03:23 - file which
03:25 - is VB
03:27 - 36.png I've already shown you
03:30 - this is the name of my Visual Basic file
03:34 - so what you can do is you can give the
03:36 - full path of uh the PNG file like this
03:41 - so it's a full path of the PNG file but
03:45 - you need to add double slashes to your
03:48 - path otherwise if your PNG file is PNG
03:53 - or any other jpg or whatever file you
03:56 - want is in your bin folder which is
04:00 - which contains your uh executable file
04:03 - here then you don't need to give any
04:06 - path you can just write the name of the
04:09 - path because it sees this path
04:12 - automatically if it's already in the
04:15 - binary folder okay and then I will just
04:19 - copy this PDF doc which is my PDF
04:22 - document dot add I will say and in the
04:27 - bracket I will pass my IMD
04:30 - G image and these two lines will add an
04:34 - image to your PDF document so let's try
04:38 - and run the program and I click let me
04:42 - show you first of all my PDF file before
04:46 - clicking
04:47 - the before clicking the create PDF
04:50 - button okay so right now I was testing
04:55 - the PDF file and I'm going to show you
04:57 - how to add this p PDF file and H how to
05:02 - give the border to my PDF file okay so
05:06 - right now I'm just adding
05:09 - the this PNG image okay so I will close
05:13 - this
05:16 - PDF and I will run my program I will say
05:19 - create PDF and now when I see my
05:22 - simple.pdf here you can see this show
05:26 - image is created and the image size will
05:30 - be the actual size of the image and for
05:33 - example you want to reduce the size of
05:36 - the image how can you reduce the size of
05:39 - the image I will just show you so go to
05:42 - the code once again and in
05:45 - between here when you declare your image
05:48 - variable and you add your image to the
05:52 - document in between
05:54 - this just write these two lines so first
05:58 - line is I am do scale percent so I have
06:02 - given 50% to the image so I have reduced
06:05 - the size of my image by half right and
06:09 - in the second line I have written IMG do
06:12 - scale to fit 250 by 250 so it will be a
06:16 - square image right now and this is the
06:19 - scale of the size okay now when I run
06:23 - the program once again and I show click
06:27 - create PDF and I open my simple PDF and
06:32 - now my image size is reduced and the
06:38 - percentage is reduced by it is reduced
06:42 - by 50%
06:45 - okay now for example I want to add the
06:49 - border to my PDF file so just go this
06:52 - below this uh
06:55 - scaling and just add these three lines
06:58 - of code to to add a border so just write
07:01 - IMG do border is equal to rectangle
07:04 - box okay so just write this line and
07:08 - then once again write IMG do border
07:10 - color this will define the color of your
07:13 - border is equal to itex Shar do text do
07:16 - base color dot whatever color you want
07:19 - right now I have selected yellow color
07:21 - but you can select any color for example
07:25 - black blue there are some options here
07:28 - for example I want to add this green
07:31 - color to my image and then in the next
07:35 - line just write IMG do border width so
07:38 - this will be the width of your border
07:41 - right now I have set my width as five
07:45 - let's make it 10 to then it will show
07:49 - bigger border width now I will run the
07:52 - program and I will click create PDF and
07:56 - once again I will see my PDF file and
08:00 - you can see I have my picture and I have
08:03 - the border which is green and which is
08:05 - of width
08:07 - 10 okay so in this way you can add image
08:11 - to your PDF file using itch shop dll and
08:15 - Visual Basic Windows Form application so
08:18 - this is the code so if you want just
08:20 - pause the video and copy the code and
08:22 - you will be good to go I hope you have
08:24 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
08:25 - and subscribe and bye for now
