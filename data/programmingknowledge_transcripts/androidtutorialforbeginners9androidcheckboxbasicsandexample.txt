00:02 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:03 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:05 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:08 - how we can use checkboxes with our
00:11 - Android
00:13 - application so generally we use
00:15 - checkboxes whenever we want to choose uh
00:19 - a list of items for example uh you are
00:22 - making a uh groceries Shop app you can
00:27 - use checkboxes to select the it items
00:31 - right or for example uh you want to uh
00:35 - give the option to the user uh to select
00:39 - his favorite animals or favorite uh
00:42 - dishes or favorite um you know favorite
00:46 - things right so basically whenever we
00:50 - want to select uh multiple items we use
00:55 - checkboxes now to add checkboxes as you
00:59 - can see I can uh add checkboxes by going
01:02 - to my pallet and in the vidget section I
01:05 - have this checkbox um uh widget which I
01:09 - can drag and drop to my Android activity
01:14 - I'm also going to take a button so that
01:17 - on the basis of button click event I can
01:19 - decide uh which checkboxes are checked
01:23 - and on the bases of checked uh option or
01:26 - checked checked checked boxes I can take
01:30 - some action now I will choose all these
01:34 - uh or or I will select all these
01:36 - checkboxes and I'm going to change the
01:38 - properties of these
01:41 - checkboxes in the properties I'm going
01:43 - to go to layout uncore width and I'm
01:47 - going to set it to fill parent so that
01:51 - this width is uh filled in the you know
01:57 - in the width right
02:00 - now I'm going to change the name of
02:03 - these um checkboxes for example we want
02:07 - to uh create a list of animals so that
02:11 - user can choose his favorite animals for
02:14 - example dog and in here you will see uh
02:18 - this option checked so in here if you uh
02:22 - choose this option checked you can see
02:25 - whenever you run the application uh it
02:28 - will be checked by default fault
02:31 - otherwise when you uncheck this
02:33 - option your uh you know whenever you uh
02:37 - start your activity this checkbox will
02:40 - be unchecked so this is the default
02:43 - condition you want to check to your
02:45 - checkbox okay the name to the checkbox
02:48 - we can give according to the name for
02:50 - example checkbox
02:58 - dog
03:02 - now we will go to the code part of our
03:06 - uh activity so I will go to my main
03:09 - activity. Java file and in here we are
03:14 - going to declare
03:16 - uh these variables so we are going to
03:19 - declare three checkbox variable
03:22 - and one button
03:28 - variable
03:44 - okay so now our variables are declared
03:48 - now we are going to uh create a method
03:51 - this will be the
03:53 - public method and it's not going to
03:57 - return anything and we we are going to
04:00 - name
04:02 - our method as for example
04:08 - add listener on button
04:15 - okay and then it's not going to take any
04:19 - argument and we will create or prepare
04:23 - the body of our function in these curly
04:26 - braces now inside here we are going to
04:29 - cast our checkboxes and button and we
04:34 - are going to cast them by ID so for
04:37 - example for the checkbox one we are
04:40 - going to cast it to the dog
04:58 - checkbox
05:10 - now once we have casted all our uh
05:14 - widgets now we are going to um
05:19 - add The Listener so we are going
05:23 - to take our button variable and we will
05:27 - set the listener to it set
05:30 - on click listener and in here in the
05:35 - arguments just press enter and we are
05:37 - going to create a new listener so
05:41 - new onclick
05:44 - listener on click listener and this
05:48 - takes three arguments right on click
05:52 - yeah right so we will create a buffer
05:56 - string buffer so in here we are going to
06:00 - create
06:04 - a string
06:10 - buffer result is equal to
06:17 - new string
06:20 - buffer and
06:24 - then let me reformat otherwise it will
06:27 - go out of the screen so so select all
06:31 - cut and paste once
06:33 - again and now we are going to add a
06:38 - toast uh and in this result we are going
06:42 - to append the checked item first so
06:45 - first of all this result take this
06:48 - result
06:50 - variable so in here result
06:55 - dot
06:57 - append and we can append any string to
07:00 - it so in the double quotes you can just
07:04 - write
07:06 - dog and if it's checked we will say it's
07:10 - checked otherwise we will say it's not
07:12 - checked so append this string
07:15 - dogs dot
07:18 - append and in here we are going to
07:21 - append if the checkbox is checked or not
07:24 - right so we will take the first checkbox
07:27 - which is for dog field dot is
07:31 - checked
07:33 - is checked okay and this will give you
07:37 - the Binary Option true or false or one
07:41 - or
07:42 - zero if it's checked it's going to give
07:45 - you true or if it's unchecked it's going
07:48 - to give you false right and we are going
07:52 - to just close this in the same way for
07:57 - cat and cow we will do the
08:06 - same and now we can display this uh
08:10 - result to the toast so we can just
08:15 - write toast dot make
08:20 - text make text and in here we are going
08:24 - to select our activity which is our main
08:27 - activity here or the class name
08:31 - dot this then we will choose uh the text
08:37 - we want to display so the text we want
08:40 - to display is this result
08:42 - variable so just copy and paste result
08:45 - do to
08:47 - string okay because it's a buffer so we
08:50 - need to convert it to string
08:58 - Dot
09:02 - now once we have uh created this method
09:05 - we just need to call it in our create on
09:09 - create method which is this one right so
09:12 - just goow go below this set content View
09:15 - and just paste your method name which is
09:18 - this one and now we are going to run our
09:21 - application and now our application is
09:23 - running so for example uh
09:27 - we check
09:29 - checkbox one and checkbox two and press
09:32 - this select button the answer is dog is
09:36 - equal to true and cat is equal to true
09:39 - you can see dog true cat true and cow
09:42 - false so uh if you want to add the line
09:46 - ending you can just add this line ending
09:49 - here back slash n and In Here Also back
09:55 - slash n right and once again run the
09:59 - program and now once we select all the
10:03 - options it says Dog True cat true and
10:06 - cow true and if we unselect some option
10:10 - now only dog is true cat is false and
10:13 - cow is false okay so in this way you can
10:17 - uh choose your selection on the basis of
10:21 - is Select method here right now let's
10:24 - create a method on which we will allow
10:29 - the user to take some action on this uh
10:33 - checkbox click itself okay so for
10:36 - example uh once selector uses or user
10:41 - you selects this uh doc checkbox uh we
10:44 - are going to display some message that
10:46 - you select a dog without any button
10:49 - click event so what we are going to do
10:52 - is we are going
10:53 - to declare one more method which will be
10:58 - public
11:05 - now once again we are going to cast our
11:08 - checkbox uh one variable because we want
11:11 - to take action on checkbox one so I will
11:15 - copy the code from here and then we want
11:20 - to you know uh take this uh checkbox one
11:26 - and then we will set all on click
11:29 - listeners dot set on click
11:32 - listener and in the argument just click
11:36 - enter
11:38 - new onclick
11:41 - listener and in here you just need to uh
11:45 - write if the check box is checked so we
11:48 - will just check the condition
11:57 - if
11:59 - and we will take our variable from view
12:02 - which is V so just take it here V and
12:08 - then we will enclose it in a bracket
12:12 - also so just add one more bracket
12:20 - here and then dot is
12:27 - checked and if uh the checkbox is
12:32 - checked we are going
12:34 - to perform some action so we will
12:38 - display
12:41 - toast
12:43 - dot make text and in here the class name
12:48 - once
12:53 - again dot
12:57 - this
13:01 - comma if it's uh checked we are going to
13:04 - display some message here so let's uh
13:08 - display a message for example we will
13:11 - display
13:14 - dog
13:17 - is selected okay and then the third
13:21 - argument is the
13:23 - same toast
13:26 - dot length long
13:29 - and then we will just show this dot
13:33 - show okay and I will add it in
13:37 - here and now we are going to run it okay
13:42 - so that it'll listen on this uh dog
13:47 - checkbox this one so you see whenever I
13:52 - check the uh dog checkbox I will check
13:56 - it and it shows dog is selected
13:59 - and when I uncheck it once again check
14:03 - it dog is selected but when I check cat
14:06 - checkbox it doesn't show any message
14:09 - because I haven't added any uh you know
14:12 - uh listener to these checkboxes I have
14:15 - added listener to the dog checkbox only
14:18 - so whenever I check it it shows dog is
14:21 - selected but you can add the same kind
14:24 - of listener to these checkboxes
14:26 - also so in this way you can use
14:29 - checkboxes in your Android app I hope
