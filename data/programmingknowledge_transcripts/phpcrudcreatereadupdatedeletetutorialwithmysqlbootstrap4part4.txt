00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to
00:01 - programming knowledge and this is the
00:03 - fourth part of the five-part video
00:05 - tutorial series on how to create a very
00:08 - simple application that enables the
00:10 - creation read update and delete of
00:14 - certain records from our database so
00:17 - from the previous tutorial we have
00:19 - worked with the form dot PHP file and
00:22 - added the logic for editing or user and
00:26 - also for adding the user to our database
00:30 - so we have not yet tested our script but
00:34 - let's just continue working on with this
00:36 - index dot PHP and try to display all the
00:40 - users that we have added to a database
00:43 - so later on we're going to have to test
00:47 - the project if all the things that we
00:50 - have worked works and try to see if
00:55 - there's any problems with our logic or
00:57 - anything so for now let's just continue
01:02 - working on with this index that PHP and
01:04 - try to display all the users from our
01:09 - database so the first step that we're
01:13 - gonna make is to require first the user
01:16 - class so again because we're going to
01:20 - use this class to manipulate all the
01:24 - necessary things that we need for class
01:27 - for the users okay so user classes
01:31 - inserted at PHP and we're going to add a
01:35 - new object out of this particular class
01:38 - user so object user was your user and
01:45 - here we need to run a query for us to
01:51 - get all the users that are saved in our
01:56 - database so here I think inside here and
02:01 - then we need to have we need to add a
02:05 - table for this right so before that
02:09 - we're going to add a division or death
02:12 - element and you need to have this glass
02:19 - table responsive responsive and inside
02:27 - this dip is the table actual table and
02:30 - this table has to have this plus table
02:33 - and table stripe okay and table SM and
02:42 - we need to define the table head for
02:45 - this which contains a table rock for our
02:52 - headers okay
02:54 - so pH this is for righty and the course
03:03 - name and the email email there you go
03:14 - and we're just going to add another
03:17 - empty table head for this so this is
03:23 - actually for the actions say for example
03:25 - if we want to add it or something so we
03:28 - can add for this particular column a
03:31 - value or a bottle something like that if
03:34 - we need to so after the table head we
03:37 - need to run the query first to get the
03:40 - users from our database so the finder
03:44 - query and inside this is select on from
03:52 - good users and the final statement we're
03:57 - gonna use the object to run the query
04:02 - there you go and we're going to use the
04:06 - query that we have already defined and
04:10 - then here we need to execute the
04:12 - statement okay
04:16 - so after this we need to define the
04:19 - table body of our table of course and we
04:25 - need to check first if we have something
04:30 - or we've got something from our
04:32 - statement so if statement raw count is
04:40 - greater than greater than zero which
04:44 - means we have users who are rehab
04:47 - already users that have been added to
04:49 - our database so if the user or we have
04:57 - users then we need to execute the
05:05 - fetching of the users or the actual
05:08 - users so raw user and equals the
05:12 - statement fetch and video fetch
05:21 - associative array and of course opening
05:27 - curly brace and this also and first
05:39 - we're going to arrange this first and
05:41 - we're going to close first this
05:45 - statement
05:47 - hey below I think it should be here
05:57 - mm here right about here so HP and close
06:14 - the while statement and of course we're
06:17 - going to close the if statement okay so
06:21 - after that we're going to if the user
06:25 - has or if the statement has grossed then
06:29 - which means we need to populate our
06:33 - table so first we need to define the
06:37 - table row first okay and also the table
06:42 - data so the first thing that we are
06:46 - going to add here is the ID of the user
06:50 - so this will be 4 ie D so pen row user
06:58 - and then of course we're going to get D
07:02 - ID okay and the second one will be our
07:12 - [Music]
07:15 - name okay so row user and the name but
07:24 - for this particular table data we need
07:27 - to do something also for editing or user
07:32 - so instead of playing displaying the
07:36 - name we need to add a link that links to
07:40 - our form that PHP file and we're going
07:44 - to supply the ID for this link because
07:48 - as you can remember the foreign dot PHP
07:51 - file can accept edit underscore ID which
07:56 - signify the ideal domain or we're trying
07:59 - to edit so form that PHP and then we
08:06 - find the Eddie
08:07 - for ID equals HP and we're going to pain
08:17 - the ID of our user there you go
08:25 - and of course we need to close our link
08:34 - so right about here you have to close
08:37 - the deal which contains the name of our
08:43 - users so whenever we click on this
08:45 - particular user name it will be
08:46 - redirected to forum that PHP that
08:49 - contains or setting the edit underscore
08:51 - ID and if the Edit underscore ID is set
08:57 - then that's the time that the forum will
09:00 - be populated with values are the ID the
09:05 - name and the email so let's go back here
09:09 - and of course now that we have the name
09:13 - we also need one for our email so this
09:17 - one is for our email and we need to add
09:22 - another one for delete so of course we
09:28 - want our project to have this delete
09:32 - capability or functionality so whenever
09:35 - we click on this delete function then
09:37 - we're going to there's a dialog box or a
09:42 - dialog that says or a confirmation that
09:45 - says do you really want do you really
09:48 - want to delete this particular user so
09:51 - if you want to confirm then the user
09:52 - will be deleted ok so I think we're
09:57 - we're just going to copy and paste this
10:01 - link here and instead replace this into
10:09 - this link and instead of form that PHP
10:14 - we need to set this into index dot PHP
10:16 - and of course the query variable in
10:21 - to delete underscore ID so we're gonna
10:24 - leave this row ID here and instead of
10:29 - using the name we're going to get or use
10:35 - the feature of bootstrap to display a
10:43 - trash icon there you go
10:47 - so if we try to refresh our page right
10:50 - now so let's go back to our browser and
10:52 - try to see our index dot PHP so go back
11:00 - to index dot PHP and here we have index
11:04 - dot PHP and as you can see we now have
11:07 - records to our table but it is not
11:11 - formatting correctly ok so let's go back
11:14 - to our code and try to edit and try to
11:17 - figure out what's wrong with our logic
11:19 - because we know that we have already the
11:23 - record but it is not aligned correctly
11:27 - with our columns form full name email
11:29 - and the actions here for our ticket so
11:33 - let's go back to our code editor ok so
11:37 - we need to change something here so
11:40 - instead of separating this table records
11:46 - for table data so we need to make sure
11:50 - that all the table records or table data
11:53 - belongs to this particular table record
11:55 - so there you go so table records and all
12:04 - the table data inside so save and
12:09 - refresh this page so there you go we
12:14 - have the data that comes from our
12:17 - database so now let's try to add a new
12:20 - record to this form or this table so go
12:24 - to the form dot PHP by clicking on this
12:28 - add new icon or option here and
12:32 - so the first thing that we're going to
12:34 - input is the name so for example we need
12:39 - we will just name our new user as Jake
12:47 - Jake number and the email is Jake
12:51 - Nomar at gmail.com and save so as you
12:59 - can see the Jake Nomar has been added so
13:01 - this particular table but we don't have
13:04 - the prompt that the user has been added
13:07 - so we're going to work on that in the
13:09 - next video and if you're new here in our
13:12 - child please try to subscribe and
13:14 - present if ocation bell so you'll get
13:16 - updated whenever we have a new upload
13:19 - thanks
