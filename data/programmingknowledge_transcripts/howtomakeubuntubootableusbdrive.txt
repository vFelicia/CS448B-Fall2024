00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can create
00:04 - a bootable usb drive for your
00:07 - ubuntu operating system so for
00:10 - creating a bootable usb drive for your
00:13 - ubuntu operating system you need
00:15 - two things first one is the iso file
00:18 - of your official ubuntu operating system
00:22 - which is available
00:23 - on the official website of ubuntu and
00:26 - the second thing
00:27 - is a tool which will help us
00:30 - to create this bootable usb drive
00:33 - and the third thing is obviously the
00:37 - usb drive which should be
00:40 - a 4gb at least but i would recommend
00:44 - you to use 8 gb bootable
00:47 - usb drive okay so if you have 8gb
00:50 - bootable usb drive then you are good to
00:54 - go
00:55 - so let's see how we can download the
00:58 - iso file first of all for ubuntu
01:00 - operating system
01:01 - you can just search for ubuntu and the
01:04 - first link which will appear here will
01:05 - be from ubuntu.com
01:07 - so i'm going to just click on this link
01:10 - and straight away
01:11 - you will see uh this option here which
01:14 - is
01:14 - uh what's new in ubuntu 2004
01:18 - because 2004 is the latest version
01:22 - of ubuntu which is released recently
01:25 - so here you will see a downloads uh
01:29 - tab here and when you click on the
01:31 - download tab
01:32 - you will see the ubuntu desktop so
01:35 - you can just click on the version which
01:38 - is available
01:40 - and most probably you might want to
01:42 - install the lts
01:44 - version okay so make sure that whenever
01:47 - you install ubuntu you install the
01:49 - lts version lts means the long term
01:52 - support version
01:53 - which will at least run for two years
01:57 - okay so the support will run for two
01:59 - years
02:00 - so i'm going to just click on ubuntu
02:02 - desktop
02:04 - and here you will see the download
02:06 - button so i'm going to just click
02:08 - on the download button and when you
02:09 - click on the download button
02:11 - the iso file will be downloaded on your
02:15 - windows operating system so this file is
02:17 - around 2.5 gb file so it will take some
02:19 - time to download
02:20 - but i have already downloaded this file
02:23 - on my windows operating system so i'm
02:25 - going to just cancel
02:26 - this download and also if you want to
02:29 - support ubuntu project
02:31 - then you can just give small donation to
02:35 - ubuntu
02:36 - for now i don't want to do anything so i
02:39 - have just downloaded the iso file
02:41 - so once you have downloaded the iso file
02:43 - it's going to look like this
02:45 - in case you have downloaded the 2004
02:49 - version of ubuntu
02:50 - so the name is ubuntu hyphen 2004
02:54 - hyphen desktop hyphen amd64 dot
02:58 - iso file so rufus is
03:02 - a tool which will allow you to create
03:04 - bootable
03:05 - usb drives on your windows operating
03:08 - system
03:09 - so the usb drive which you
03:12 - will create using rufus you can use it
03:16 - to install let's say windows operating
03:18 - system or
03:19 - ubuntu operating system or any other
03:22 - linux or windows operating system
03:24 - so let's see how we can install rufus on
03:27 - our windows operating system
03:29 - so the first uh thing you need to do is
03:32 - you just need to go to your favorite
03:33 - browser and search for rufus
03:36 - and the first link which will appear
03:37 - here will be from rufus.ie
03:40 - and you can see rufus is a small
03:41 - application which creates a
03:43 - bootable usb drive which can then be
03:46 - used to install
03:47 - microsoft windows linux or dos operating
03:50 - system so i'm going to just click on
03:52 - this
03:52 - link here and then straight away uh
03:55 - you will be see able to see this kind of
03:58 - interface here
03:59 - from here you can choose your language
04:02 - by default it's in
04:03 - english but if you want to choose any
04:05 - other language you can choose it from
04:07 - here and when you scroll down
04:10 - you will be able to see uh the latest
04:13 - version of
04:15 - rufus here so what we are going to do is
04:17 - we are going to choose
04:19 - the latest one which is on the top which
04:21 - is
04:22 - rufus 3.10 at the time of making this
04:25 - video so i'm going to just click on this
04:27 - link
04:28 - which will download this
04:31 - rufus.exe file so i'm going to just
04:33 - click on save which is going to save
04:35 - this exe file
04:37 - and once this executable file is
04:39 - downloaded just click on this executable
04:41 - file
04:42 - and then i'm going to minimize the
04:44 - browser here
04:45 - and here it says do you want to allow
04:47 - roofers to check
04:49 - for the application updates online i'm
04:52 - going to just say
04:52 - yes here
04:56 - once your roofers tool is launched we
04:58 - are going to insert
05:00 - our usb drive so i'm going to just
05:02 - insert
05:03 - my uh usb drive here and you just need
05:06 - to wait for a few seconds
05:08 - until this rufus tool detects this usb
05:11 - drive
05:12 - and as you can see this usb drive is 8
05:14 - gb
05:15 - in size which is ok for me so now using
05:18 - this boot selection option
05:20 - just leave it as default which is disk
05:22 - or iso
05:23 - image and then we are going to click on
05:25 - this
05:26 - select option so just click on select
05:28 - option
05:29 - and then give the path of your iso file
05:32 - where
05:33 - your iso file is downloaded on your
05:35 - windows operating system
05:37 - so as you can see my ubuntu operating
05:40 - system iso file is located here so i'm
05:42 - going to just select it
05:43 - and then click on ok which is going to
05:46 - just
05:47 - import this file into this rufus tool
05:50 - now you can also do the checksum
05:53 - for your image but because we have
05:57 - downloaded this
05:58 - iso file from the official website so
06:00 - you can also skip
06:02 - this step now in the partition scheme
06:06 - just leave it as default which is mbr
06:09 - and also target system you can just
06:11 - leave it as default which is bios or
06:14 - uefi and then the volume name this will
06:18 - be the name of your usb drive so you can
06:21 - just leave it as default and then
06:24 - the file system also you can leave it as
06:27 - default
06:28 - so you can leave everything as shown in
06:31 - this
06:32 - tool and then once you are ready you can
06:35 - click on the start button
06:36 - you have also these advanced
06:40 - format options you can quickly see them
06:43 - but i'm going to leave everything as
06:45 - default here
06:46 - and then i can just click on the start
06:48 - button
06:49 - so this warning says download required
06:51 - this image uses
06:53 - sys linux version this one but this
06:56 - application only includes
06:58 - the installation file for cis linux so
07:01 - i'm going to just click on yes
07:03 - which is going to download it and then
07:07 - this warning appears which is right
07:10 - in the iso image mode which is
07:12 - recommended so i'm going to
07:14 - just click on ok but before clicking on
07:17 - ok make sure
07:19 - that your usb drive is completely
07:22 - empty otherwise whatever data you have
07:26 - inside your usb drive
07:27 - will be lost i'm going to just click on
07:30 - ok now and now i can see
07:32 - this warning which says all data on the
07:34 - device
07:35 - this one will be destroyed so make sure
07:38 - and double check
07:39 - if you want any data inside your usb
07:42 - drive just back it up and you if you are
07:45 - sure that you don't need any data and
07:47 - your usb drive is
07:49 - totally empty you can just click on ok
07:51 - which is going to
07:52 - start the process of creating this
07:56 - bootable usb drive so here you can see
07:59 - the process
08:01 - and once this green progress bar reaches
08:03 - to
08:04 - the end then your bootable usb drive
08:08 - will be finished
08:09 - so now i can see this message which says
08:11 - ready that means my bootable
08:13 - usb drive for the ubuntu operating
08:16 - system is ready
08:18 - so let me go to the pc and let me show
08:21 - you
08:22 - this e drive which is my usb
08:25 - drive you will be able to see the name
08:27 - which you have chosen
08:29 - so in my case i have chosen ubuntu 20.04
08:32 - so this is how you can create a bootable
08:36 - usb drive for your ubuntu operating
08:38 - system
08:38 - i hope you've enjoyed this video and i
08:40 - will see you in the next video
