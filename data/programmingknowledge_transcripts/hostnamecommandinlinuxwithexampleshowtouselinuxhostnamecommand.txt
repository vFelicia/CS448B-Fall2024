00:00 - now in this video we are going to learn
00:01 - about another command that is the host
00:04 - name command okay so basically hostname
00:06 - command is we use to get the information
00:08 - about your what is the host name like
00:11 - this name and how you can change the
00:14 - name also with the help of host command
00:16 - you will get the
00:17 - uh IP address okay
00:20 - so we will start with the implementation
00:22 - part
00:24 - so let me increase the first font size
00:26 - so hope it is visible to you so now what
00:30 - we have to do we have to just write a
00:31 - hostname so it will basically give you
00:33 - the whatever the host name of your
00:34 - computer that is this one I use
00:36 - virtualbox okay so also you can uh like
00:39 - uh what we say change the host name and
00:43 - also you can get the IP address using
00:46 - different options if I will use hyphen I
00:48 - then it will give me this localhost IP
00:50 - address and but if you will use the
00:53 - capital i
00:54 - then in that case you will get the
00:56 - actual IP address and whatever the IP
00:58 - address the will be present in your
01:00 - system so in this case we have only one
01:03 - IP address and now moving forward uh
01:06 - the interesting part of this particular
01:08 - video is that you can change the host
01:12 - name also so how you can do it it
01:14 - totally there are basically two methods
01:16 - and you should be like uh run this
01:20 - command as a root okay like in my case
01:23 - this I use user is like in the sudos
01:26 - file and we can easily change it using
01:29 - this particular command so how you can
01:31 - do it uh you have to just use this
01:34 - particular sudo host name and host name
01:38 - and then what we have to do you have to
01:40 - just give the uh different
01:43 - name okay I will give this one
01:46 - actually this is my Instagram page
01:49 - username uh you can follow if you want
01:52 - so
01:55 - I think I enter wrong password let me
01:58 - erase now I use
02:01 - okay so a specified hostname is invalid
02:04 - because we have used underscore so
02:05 - underscores are not allowed I will just
02:07 - remove it underscores
02:10 - and hit enter and now I will again open
02:13 - up the one terminal new terminal and
02:15 - here you can see the
02:18 - host name has been changed from ayush
02:20 - virtualbox to this one exabyte okay so
02:24 - but now what I want I want to uh like
02:27 - keep my host name as it is so I will
02:29 - just copy this one
02:33 - and what I'll do I will just again uh
02:37 - run this command use this and now in
02:39 - this case you will get that same ad same
02:42 - as preview previous one okay
02:44 - so moving forward uh if you want to
02:46 - change this hostname in some kind of
02:49 - different method so how you can do it
02:50 - it's uh it is very unique thing you can
02:53 - say like you will you will use the
02:56 - one file I will create one file that is
02:58 - uh let's create with the hostname.txt
03:02 - and I will write the
03:05 - hostname as let me write
03:07 - uh let's write same thing as a white and
03:10 - Ctrl D to save and now what we have to
03:12 - do uh you have to just use this command
03:16 - that is the sudo
03:20 - host name and capital F and the file
03:23 - name which webkit that is hostname.txt
03:26 - and now again I will open up the new
03:28 - terminal and here you can see the
03:31 - hostname has been changed from Ice
03:33 - virtualbox to excavate again
03:36 - so in this way you can change the host
03:38 - name also very easily now moving forward
03:40 - uh if you talk about the like fqdn that
03:45 - is a fully qualified domain name that is
03:47 - basically domain name for a specific
03:48 - computer or a host on the internet you
03:50 - can select that so how you find it using
03:53 - this only one option that is hyphen f so
03:57 - this is the now my actual
04:01 - host name so in this case you can get
04:03 - the fqdns also if you want to learn more
04:05 - about it you can just Google it what is
04:07 - what are fqdns
04:09 - so uh first now let me again change my
04:12 - hostname to the previous one this one
04:15 - yeah
04:15 - now it changed
04:18 - so yeah done
04:20 - so uh I hope you like this particular
