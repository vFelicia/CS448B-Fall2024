00:00 - hello there and in today's lecture you
00:02 - will learn about how to delete a
00:04 - visualization using si bon library so we
00:08 - learn how to create basic plots using si
00:10 - bon library so those plots are scatter
00:12 - plot
00:13 - then we do we'll do histogram then we do
00:16 - bar plot then box and whiskers plot and
00:19 - then pair wise plots so let's get
00:22 - started so Seabourn what is the C pawn
00:24 - so C bond is a Python data
00:26 - virtualization library based on Metro
00:28 - tape library so it provides a high level
00:30 - interface for drawing attractive and
00:33 - informative statistical graphs so let's
00:37 - see how to do a scatter plot using
00:39 - seabone library we are already seen in
00:41 - the MEDC lotof library so scatter plot
00:44 - of price versus H we do this and then
00:47 - with the default arguments so first what
00:49 - we have to do is we can call the Saban
00:52 - liability by calling SNS that is an
00:55 - alias for seabone library I will show
00:56 - you how to do that then SNS dot set
00:59 - first we will set the style or theme for
01:02 - the plot so style equal to dark grid so
01:05 - we'll use the grid theme now we will
01:08 - draw the scatter plot so for that we
01:11 - have to call a function called reg plot
01:13 - so that is a regression pot so inside
01:16 - that we have to pass our x coordinate so
01:19 - I am passing x equal to cos theta 8 so
01:22 - this is the column from the data frame
01:24 - and you know I axis I want price so I
01:26 - will pass y equal to data frame and
01:29 - slicing operator at the price and if we
01:34 - run that we will get this plot so this
01:37 - is scatter plot along with that you
01:39 - might have noticed that is is lying here
01:41 - so this line is called as a regression
01:43 - line and by default that that line is
01:47 - true so for that a very variable is used
01:50 - that is fit underscore rack
01:52 - equal to true so by default is true
01:55 - that's why the line is displayed here if
01:58 - you want to remove it you can just add
02:00 - it here
02:00 - along with the red plot function that
02:03 - fit really equal to false so what it
02:05 - does it estimates and plots or
02:07 - regression model relating the x and y
02:10 - variables so it calculus
02:12 - the coefficient of x variables and throw
02:15 - us a line through the scatterplot
02:16 - let's go over to our Jupiter notebook
02:19 - and here we have to import the sheep on
02:24 - library so for their type Seaborn as SS
02:29 - y son is is a alias for simple liability
02:32 - so anyway we have to call any function
02:34 - from sleep on library we will call call
02:36 - SNS then we will call the function name
02:38 - now we will start the scatter plot
02:49 - you
02:52 - interesting to mark down
02:54 - and
02:56 - what we can do will set the theme or
02:59 - that will call set function from SNS
03:03 - and we'll pass style equal to there are
03:05 - many styles so I will use particular
03:08 - dark grid this is default styles and now
03:14 - we will draw the regression plot or
03:16 - scatter plot you can see first we'll
03:22 - pass the x-axis support there we'll call
03:26 - our data frame then a slicing operator
03:27 - inside that will pass age then for y y
03:34 - axis will call the price column and if
03:43 - you run along with our warning we got
03:48 - our scatter plot so you can see we have
03:52 - a regression line here and you can see
03:56 - the negative correlation as the age of
03:58 - the car increases the price of the car
04:00 - decreases so what we can do will I'll
04:03 - show you how to remove that line for
04:07 - that will pass we try equal to false
04:10 - variable now you can see the line is not
04:13 - present so these are called markers and
04:17 - this 0 10 20 30 these are called x6
04:21 - labels and these are Y ticks labels and
04:25 - these are pertaining to price and these
04:27 - are pertaining to age now let me show
04:29 - you how to change the marker so we have
04:31 - default marker that is a circle you can
04:35 - change the markers also here for that
04:41 - we'll set the marker variable and it
04:45 - will take a string because start and if
04:48 - you don't this now you can see the all
04:50 - the circles are changed to starts now
04:54 - there are other parameters also so there
04:57 - are options for markers also you can go
05:00 - through let in the documentation I will
05:02 - give the link in the documentation now
05:06 - this is for two variables bias and age
05:10 - so if you want to for three variables
05:13 - like fairy-type so these were two
05:16 - numerical variables so what if you want
05:18 - to add one more categorical variables so
05:22 - for that how we can do I will show you
05:24 - that so if you have scatter plot of
05:26 - price versus age and you want to do it
05:29 - by for any type so you can do that so
05:32 - for that you have to use a parameter
05:34 - called
05:34 - you parameter including another variable
05:37 - to show the fuel type categories with
05:38 - different colors so there is a function
05:41 - for this in C bond library called LM
05:43 - plot so this helps us to add another
05:46 - categorical variable in the numerical
05:49 - variables scatter plot so for that we
05:52 - will pass X equal to 8 y equal to price
05:55 - and data equal to cos theta so this is a
05:58 - data frame and when we pass theta equal
06:01 - to cos theta the x and YX is
06:04 - automatically taken from this data frame
06:07 - is agent price you don't need to use
06:10 - slicing operator and now we do heat
06:13 - travel to false you don't need the
06:15 - regression line and then we will pass
06:17 - here equal to fuel type and we also want
06:21 - legend so to know which fuel type is
06:25 - which color will include light liquid
06:27 - true and the palette that is a colors
06:30 - scheme which will use is set 1 so I will
06:34 - show this barony will type SN s dot L M
06:38 - plot inside that will include X X equal
06:42 - to H comma y equal to price comma data
06:53 - equal to rate of thing we have cars data
06:58 - comma then we don't want regression line
07:03 - equal so feet are equal to false then
07:07 - the hue parameter we have no parameter
07:10 - is fair type
07:16 - then legendry want equal to true then
07:21 - palette so palette we are setting as set
07:28 - one so these are pretty predefined
07:31 - values so if you run this you got a nice
07:34 - plot along with the flow type so we can
07:38 - see four tabs so these are called legend
07:41 - and the red color stands for diesel fuel
07:44 - type
07:45 - green green color stand for CNG and blue
07:48 - color stands for petrol so you can see
07:50 - the there are more number of blue colors
07:52 - that is petrol fuel type and you can see
07:56 - as the age of the car increases the
07:59 - price of the car decreases it is
08:00 - negative correlation along with that the
08:04 - prices of the car is very high for
08:07 - diesel fuel type when the age is very
08:10 - new and as the age of the car increases
08:14 - for all the fuel types the price of the
08:17 - car decreases so let's get back to our
08:20 - slides and you can also change the
08:24 - scatter plot by using the different
08:27 - markers such as transparency shape and
08:31 - size so you can increase or decrease the
08:34 - transparency the shape of the data
08:36 - points all the markers and the size of
08:39 - the markers so this you can get through
08:42 - the documentation so for Seaborn Docs if
08:46 - you go there is whole lot of
08:49 - documentation provided so what we can do
08:52 - we are doing four so markers if you
08:55 - search if you go see bond or scatter
08:57 - plot so we can get the color palette and
09:07 - if you go down so markers you can change
09:18 - so there are some examples given here
09:23 - you can see
09:28 - you can get the laser inside the
09:30 - scatterplot you can piece the size and
09:34 - decrease the size you can use size is
09:36 - equal to 20 comma 200 like that and
09:39 - there are different palettes and select
09:41 - see map etc and encourage you to go
09:51 - through the docks also to get better
09:52 - understanding of different types of
09:54 - plots and how to draw it and I will give
09:56 - the link of the documentation in the
09:59 - description of the video
