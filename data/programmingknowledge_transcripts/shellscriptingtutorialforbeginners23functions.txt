00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:03 - in this video and some of the next
00:06 - coming videos I am going to show you how
00:08 - functions works in shell scripting so
00:12 - let's get started
00:13 - so like any other programming language
00:15 - bash also supports function though they
00:19 - have somewhat limited implementations
00:22 - right now first of all what is a
00:25 - function a function is a subroutine or
00:28 - you can say it's a code block that
00:30 - implements a set of operations so for
00:34 - any user it's like a black box right it
00:40 - has some name and it implements some
00:44 - functionality and then later user can
00:48 - use this function once or multiple times
00:52 - so let's see an example and let's see
00:55 - how we can use functions in shell
00:59 - scripting so there are two ways of using
01:02 - functions one is like this and this is
01:07 - the first look at notation and for this
01:11 - you use a keyword function and then you
01:14 - give a name to your function and then
01:17 - you execute some commands right the
01:20 - second notation for the function is like
01:23 - this so you directly give the name to
01:26 - your function and then you give these
01:29 - parentheses and then you use these curly
01:33 - brackets and here comes your commands
01:37 - right so like this or like this so you
01:40 - can use functions like this in this
01:44 - notation or in this notation okay so we
01:48 - are going to see both of the notations
01:51 - and we will see how we can use it so
01:54 - let's say we want to print hello world
01:58 - using a function right so let's do it
02:03 - with this one we can just say hello here
02:08 - or you can add say anything using
02:12 - function right so you can give any name
02:16 - to a function and then we can you know
02:20 - give some commands inside this function
02:23 - inside these curly brackets so I'm going
02:25 - to just give echo and I am going to say
02:29 - hello here right and in the next
02:33 - function for example I want a function
02:37 - that whenever I call it it's going to
02:40 - quit the script right so let's say this
02:45 - function name is quit okay and what it
02:48 - does is it just calls this command which
02:51 - is going to exit our shell script right
02:54 - so let's use this function first of all
02:58 - this Hello function to print something
03:00 - so to use a function in a script you
03:05 - just call it okay so let's first run the
03:09 - script we have just declared these two
03:12 - functions right and whenever we run the
03:15 - script what happens nothing happens
03:17 - because we haven't called any function
03:20 - by its name so to call a function this
03:23 - is just the declaration of a function
03:25 - right so to call a function you just
03:27 - need to give the name of this function
03:30 - so for example I'm calling the function
03:32 - hello then I'm going to run the script
03:35 - is going to print hello right now let's
03:40 - call this function which is a quit
03:43 - function and I'm calling this quit
03:46 - function before hello function right and
03:49 - then let's say I'm just echoing
03:53 - something so I'm echoing for example
03:56 - some word whoo-hoo okay so let's run the
04:01 - script and let's see what happens so I'm
04:03 - going to just run the script and nothing
04:06 - happens because what we have done here
04:08 - is we have called a quit function first
04:12 - of all and quit function just creates
04:15 - the script and the chance of calling
04:19 - this or this does not come because this
04:22 - function is called first and it directly
04:25 - quits
04:26 - the script right let's see the sequence
04:31 - like this so first of all we call holo
04:34 - and then we call this squid function
04:37 - after the holo function and let's run
04:39 - the script and now holo is printed but
04:43 - this echo is not printed echo Fuu right
04:47 - because the sequence is something like
04:51 - this so first holo function is called
04:53 - and this is printed and then we call the
04:56 - squid so the script is exited and the
05:01 - chance of printing this does not come
05:04 - right then let's use this quit after the
05:09 - echo command and then once we run the
05:13 - script it prints hello from this
05:17 - function and then it prints fool from
05:20 - this command and then we call the quit
05:24 - function which exits the script
05:27 - okay so sequence of calling the function
05:31 - is important right so however you call
05:35 - the function in whatever sequence it
05:38 - will be called in that sequence so first
05:40 - of all we are calling the hello here
05:43 - then hello will be called and if you
05:47 - call you know quit at the top then quit
05:50 - will be called first and then the other
05:53 - function right so sequence is important
05:57 - and the function declaration can be done
06:01 - in any sequence right declaration can be
06:04 - done in any sequence but what matters is
06:07 - the calling of the function so on in
06:10 - whatever sequence you will call the
06:12 - function they will be called in that
06:14 - sequence right now second thing is how
06:18 - we can pass any argument to a function
06:22 - so there are some ways of passing some
06:27 - argument to our function and let's see
06:30 - how we can do it so call this function I
06:33 - have declared hello here right instead
06:36 - of hello I can just call for example
06:40 - print this is a print function right and
06:44 - then how it takes an argument or the
06:48 - argument can be used in the with the
06:52 - dollar symbol and then the number okay
06:56 - so one means the first argument then if
07:00 - we write 2 here then it means the second
07:03 - argument and then we write 3 here then
07:06 - it it means the third arguments for
07:09 - example dollar two is the second
07:11 - argument dollar 3 is the third argument
07:14 - and so on right so what we want now is
07:19 - what we want now is we want to call this
07:23 - print function right so we can just call
07:25 - this print function and how we can do or
07:28 - give our an argument you can just give
07:32 - the name whatever name or whatever
07:36 - argument you want to give after the name
07:39 - of the function so whenever you call
07:43 - this function and give this argument it
07:46 - goes here as the argument 1 + hello will
07:51 - be printed so let's see what happens so
07:54 - you can see a hollow will be printed and
07:55 - then who is printed and then we quit the
07:59 - application using this function now we
08:01 - can call a function multiple times so we
08:04 - can say hello world here and then you
08:09 - can see it prints hello
08:11 - and then world and then foo right so you
08:15 - can call it multiple times so hello
08:17 - world and then we can say again here
08:21 - right and then we run the script I says
08:26 - hello world again so you can call a
08:29 - function with multiple times with
08:32 - multiple arguments right and you can
08:36 - call the function in sequence ok let's
08:39 - give some other arguments here so you
08:43 - can give $2 to and then you can give
08:47 - dollar creature right and instead of
08:50 - calling it multiple times you can just
08:53 - care
08:54 - this world as a second argument and
08:57 - again as a third argument and then I'm
09:01 - going to just remove these callings and
09:04 - then run the script for example and it
09:08 - prints hello world again because we are
09:11 - capturing these argument using are these
09:14 - you know variables so variable one is
09:18 - for first argument variable two is for
09:20 - second argument and variable three is
09:22 - for the third argument right so this is
09:26 - the introduction to function function
09:29 - have more functionality than this simple
09:33 - operations and this we are going to see
09:35 - in the next videos so I hope you've
