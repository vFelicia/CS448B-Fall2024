00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - MongoDB tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how we can
00:07 - download Chef which is a GUI tool
00:11 - to run command on this shell
00:16 - tool now in the last video we have seen
00:19 - how we can connect to our MongoDB using
00:23 - this chef tool now in this video
00:26 - we will see how we can create our
00:29 - database and how we can drop a database
00:33 - using MongoDB now the first thing which
00:38 - we have to keep in mind is this MongoDB
00:42 - is different from relational databases
00:45 - so it has the structure something like
00:48 - this first you have the database and
00:51 - inside your database you have
00:53 - collections and inside the collections
00:56 - you have documents right so let's create
01:00 - our database so to create a database you
01:04 - need a command use and then yet the
01:08 - database name you want to create for
01:11 - example my DB ok and then we are going
01:15 - to press this button which says execute
01:18 - statement at cursor or f6 ok so just
01:22 - press this button and say switched to DB
01:28 - my DB so what does this mean it means
01:31 - that if my DB database is already
01:37 - present it is going to switch to my DB
01:41 - otherwise if the my DB database is not
01:45 - present then it's going to create the DB
01:49 - first and then it is going to switch to
01:51 - this DB ok now the second command which
01:55 - we have already seen is to list the
01:59 - current database so for example we are
02:03 - using my DB as current database to know
02:08 - this you just need to write DB and then
02:11 - press this button once again
02:13 - and says my DB which is the current
02:16 - working database right now to list out
02:21 - all the databases which are present
02:24 - right now you need to give this command
02:28 - so just give show DBS okay and this is
02:33 - going to give you the list of all the
02:36 - databases which are present so just
02:39 - press this button and it says local but
02:44 - we have recently created my DB and this
02:48 - my DB is not listed by this command
02:51 - which is show DB s the reason for this
02:54 - is because our data doesn't contain any
03:00 - documents so to show the databases or to
03:05 - show you know in the list of databases
03:08 - your database need to have some
03:10 - documents so first of all we need to
03:13 - insert some documents so what we need to
03:17 - do here we need to insert some document
03:21 - in the database so command for that is
03:24 - DB DB is a general term it's not your a
03:29 - database you are already inside your
03:32 - database by using this command right so
03:35 - DB is the general database term it's not
03:38 - the name of your database right dot the
03:42 - name of your collection for example you
03:44 - can give the name to your collection my
03:47 - collection so this is the name which can
03:50 - be given by you so we already know that
03:54 - our database can have collections which
03:57 - is this collection and then to insert
03:59 - the data you just need to write dot
04:02 - insert okay so just write dot insert and
04:05 - then in the round brackets you need to
04:10 - give some key value pair like adjacent
04:13 - right so just give these two curly
04:17 - braces and then first give the key for
04:20 - example
04:23 - name and then the value okay for example
04:27 - the name can be max okay like this one
04:32 - okay so this should be like a Jason and
04:37 - then you press our execute command
04:40 - button and then it says write result
04:44 - inserted one which is the insertion
04:49 - successful command okay now once again
04:52 - we are going to give this show dbe's
04:56 - command to see whether now we can see
05:00 - our database in the list of databases so
05:04 - once again execute this command and now
05:06 - you can see my DB is also listed in the
05:10 - list of databases right now let's see
05:13 - how we can drop a database or delete a
05:16 - database using some command right so to
05:21 - delete a database what you need to do is
05:23 - you need to give the same command use
05:27 - the database name which you want to drop
05:30 - and we have already given this command
05:33 - right now we are in this database right
05:37 - so to drop this database you just need
05:40 - to give the command DB dot drop database
05:46 - right and this is going to drop your
05:51 - database in which you are currently
05:53 - present right so DB is a general
05:57 - database term it's not the name of your
06:00 - database but just DB dot drop database
06:05 - and what it's going to do is in whatever
06:08 - database you are currently switched in
06:11 - it's going to drop this database so
06:14 - right now we are in this my DB database
06:17 - so right now when we execute this
06:20 - command it's going to say dropped my DB
06:25 - so it's going it has dropped our
06:27 - database and the result is successful so
06:31 - now once again we can say show DBS
06:36 - and then just execute it once again and
06:40 - it says local because our my database or
06:44 - my DB is already been deleted so this is
06:49 - how you can create a database and delete
06:52 - a database in MongoDB I hope you have
