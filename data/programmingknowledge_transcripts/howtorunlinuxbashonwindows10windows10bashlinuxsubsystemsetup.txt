00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can run Linux or bash
00:04 - commands on your Windows 10 operating
00:06 - system using built-in windows subsystem
00:09 - for Linux so for that you need to enable
00:13 - a few things so let's get started so
00:16 - first of all what you need to do is you
00:18 - just need to open your control panel so
00:21 - just search for control panel in your
00:24 - search box and then just click on
00:27 - control panel here and once the control
00:30 - panel window opens you just need to
00:32 - click on programs option here and then
00:35 - click on programs and features and once
00:39 - this window opens you just need to click
00:42 - on turn windows feature on or off
00:45 - okay so just click on turn windows
00:47 - feature on or off this window you can
00:50 - also see when you type here turn Windows
00:55 - Features on or off directly okay so I'm
00:58 - going to just right turn Windows
01:01 - Features on or off and when you click on
01:03 - this result you will see similar kind of
01:07 - windows so you can either just typed on
01:09 - windows feature on or off or you can go
01:12 - to this window by control panel right so
01:18 - just scroll down on this window and then
01:22 - click on this option which says windows
01:24 - subsystem 4 in Linux ok so just check
01:28 - this checkbox and then click on OK
01:30 - and once you click on OK it's going to
01:33 - search for the tools and it's going to
01:36 - apply all the changes and once
01:38 - everything is done it says windows
01:41 - completed the requested changes and then
01:44 - we need to reboot our system so you can
01:48 - just click on restart now option or you
01:50 - can manually restart your Windows
01:52 - operating system I'm going to just say
01:55 - restart now which is going to restart my
01:59 - windows operating system so once your
02:02 - windows 10 operating system restarts
02:04 - what you need to do is you can just go
02:07 - to your search bar and search for CMD
02:09 - and then choose the
02:12 - the result which says command prompt and
02:14 - then here you can just write a bash and
02:17 - then press ENTER which is going to give
02:20 - you this kind of output so this means
02:23 - that windows subsystem for linux has no
02:26 - installed distribution and you can just
02:30 - search for this using the windows stores
02:34 - so what you can do is you can just copy
02:36 - this URL from here and then open this
02:40 - URL in your browser so this is one way
02:44 - of doing it but if you don't want to do
02:47 - this you can do this by just going to
02:49 - the Microsoft Store also so just click
02:52 - on Windows icon here and then just
02:55 - choose Microsoft Store here and once the
02:59 - Microsoft Store opens you just need to
03:02 - search for let's say whatever Linux
03:05 - system you want to search here you can
03:08 - just write Linux here and then search
03:11 - for Linux systems you can see so many
03:15 - Linux operating systems available here
03:18 - what I'm going to choose is I'm going to
03:21 - choose the Ubuntu option here you can
03:24 - also choose let's say Kali Linux or
03:27 - Ubuntu 18.4 LTS version or SUSE Linux
03:33 - Debian and many other Linux operating
03:36 - system so I'm going to choose Ubuntu
03:39 - here and then you can just click on get
03:44 - and then if you have your Microsoft
03:47 - account you can just sign in with your
03:50 - Microsoft account or you can just say no
03:52 - thanks
03:53 - and then you will see the download and
03:56 - install of this open - we'll start on
04:00 - our Windows operating system so just
04:03 - wait for this process to complete this
04:05 - download and install of this ubuntu on
04:09 - our Windows operating system so I will
04:11 - just fast forward this process of
04:13 - download and install ubuntu so now I can
04:17 - see that this product is installed so I
04:19 - can launch this ubuntu by just clicking
04:22 - this button
04:23 - but if accidentally if you
04:25 - close this window you can also open open
04:28 - two by just clicking on your windows
04:31 - icon and you will be able to see open to
04:34 - hear and recently added items so I'm
04:37 - going to just click on win two here and
04:40 - it's going to start this open two
04:44 - terminal this is not the Windows 10
04:47 - command prompt its Ubuntu terminal ok so
04:51 - this is the Windows command prompt which
04:54 - I'm going to close and this is the
04:55 - Ubuntu terminal now if you want to just
04:59 - increase the font size you can just
05:02 - click on this open to I can here and
05:04 - then click on properties and let's
05:07 - choose a 20 here or 24 as the font size
05:12 - so you can see this installation process
05:15 - so this is one time installation process
05:19 - which is going to take place when you
05:21 - start your open to app on your Windows
05:25 - 10 operating system for the first time
05:27 - so I will wait for this installation and
05:29 - after some time when you press enter you
05:32 - will see this kind of prompt which says
05:36 - enter new UNIX user name so here you can
05:40 - give any user name to your new UNIX
05:44 - system I'm going to give here code bind
05:48 - as they user name for example and then
05:51 - you just need to give any password to
05:54 - your UNIX operating system so this
05:57 - password and user name should not be the
06:00 - windows username and password this can
06:02 - be any username and password which you
06:04 - want to give here so I'm going to give a
06:06 - password here and repeat the password
06:09 - and then press enter and it says
06:12 - password updated successfully so now I
06:16 - can see this kind of command prompt and
06:19 - here I'm going to just do LS - al and I
06:26 - can see this kind of output here so all
06:29 - these a bash underscore logout file is
06:32 - their bash RC is their these are the
06:35 - files which you commonly see in your
06:38 - Debian aurobindo operating system let's
06:41 - give a PWD command which is covered
06:44 - current working directory command and
06:46 - you can see it gives us a home forward
06:49 - slash your username so whatever username
06:51 - you have given here will be printed here
06:55 - after home so now you might be wondering
06:59 - how will I navigate to my C Drive or II
07:03 - drive in my Windows operating system
07:07 - using this command prompt on Ubuntu so
07:11 - the C Drive or other drives are mounted
07:15 - on your Ubuntu operating system so here
07:19 - you can just write LS and then /mnt for
07:27 - mount and then forward slash and press
07:28 - enter and you will see all the drives
07:32 - which are present on your Windows
07:35 - operating system so right now I can see
07:37 - C Drive and F Drive which are printed
07:40 - here which is exactly the same which I
07:43 - have on my Windows operating system so
07:45 - when I go to this PC I have C Drive and
07:48 - F Drive here and these are the drive
07:52 - names which are printed here now if I
07:54 - want to go to the C Drive then I can
07:57 - simply write CD command for that so I
08:00 - can just write CD /m + t /c so I want to
08:07 - go into my C directory so I will just
08:09 - write C here and now I can see that I am
08:13 - in my C directory which is Windows CE
08:17 - directory so let me clear this terminal
08:21 - and we are going to move forward so now
08:24 - I'm going to once again write LS - a l
08:28 - and you will see all the files and
08:32 - folders which are present in my C
08:36 - directory so when I go to my C directory
08:39 - you can see ffmpeg Program Files Program
08:43 - Files x86 users windows all the same
08:47 - files and folders I will see here so
08:50 - let's say I want to go to my desktop
08:52 - I will just go to here so CD and then
08:55 - right users and then press ENTER and
08:59 - once again I will do LS - Al and then I
09:04 - will go to the username so so my windows
09:09 - username is CB so I will just CD to the
09:12 - CB folder so CB and then I will once
09:16 - again do LS - al here and I will see all
09:21 - the files and folders which are present
09:23 - in my user directory so here I want to
09:28 - navigate to the desk top so I will once
09:31 - again a clear the terminals and then I
09:35 - will just CD to my desktop directory and
09:40 - here let's create some file using the
09:45 - UNIX command ok so I'm going to just
09:49 - write touch here and let me show you my
09:52 - desktop also at the same time so I'm
09:55 - going to just keep touch command on my
09:56 - open two terminal and then name my file
10:00 - anything for example test dot txt file
10:04 - and then press Enter and once I do that
10:06 - you can see this test dot txt file is
10:09 - created then I can also write for
10:13 - example Nano which is the default
10:15 - terminal or no you're open to operating
10:17 - system and then the text dot txt which
10:21 - is going to open this file in the Nano
10:23 - terminal and then I'm going to just
10:26 - write test and let me move this little
10:29 - bit up so you can see all these things
10:32 - and then I'm going to just press control
10:35 - X here and then I'm going to just type Y
10:39 - here and then press Enter
10:41 - which will get me out of this Nano
10:43 - terminal and then I'm going to just
10:45 - print the content inside this test dot
10:48 - txt file using cat command so cat test
10:52 - dot txt and you can see it prints
10:55 - whatever I have written inside my test
10:58 - dot txt file using the Nano terminal
11:01 - also you can open your bash terminal now
11:05 - using the Windows command prompt so you
11:08 - can just search for CMD here and then
11:11 - click on the command prompt here and
11:14 - once your command prompt opens you just
11:16 - need to write bash here and then press
11:19 - Enter which is going to give you the
11:21 - same command prompt as you see in the
11:25 - Ubuntu terminal okay so from here also
11:29 - you can give your open to bash commands
11:33 - and work with the Linux command using
11:37 - your Windows command prompt so this is
11:40 - how you can run your Linux or bash
11:43 - command on your Windows 10 operating
11:46 - system using the built-in windows
11:50 - subsystem for Linux I hope you've
11:53 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
11:55 - the next video
