00:01 - hello guys in this video I will show you
00:03 - how to install MySQL server on your
00:06 - Ubuntu operating system so first of all
00:09 - go to
00:12 - your terminal and open your
00:15 - terminal and once your terminal is open
00:19 - just type in this command sud sudo
00:23 - apt-get install MySQL server and click
00:27 - enter and it will ask for your password
00:30 - so I will give my password
00:33 - first and it starts
00:37 - installing MySQL on your system and then
00:42 - uh if you want to download it just give
00:47 - yes
00:49 - why
00:52 - and it start
00:57 - downloading and
01:00 - in between while installing it will ask
01:03 - for the
01:05 - password and whatever password you want
01:07 - to give to your MySQL server you can
01:11 - give to your
01:15 - MySQL so now you can see it's asking for
01:19 - the password the default user name is a
01:24 - root and you just need to give the
01:27 - password for example I want to give the
01:30 - password
01:32 - here it's a very simple password so you
01:35 - can remember and I click
01:39 - okay and it asks for the password again
01:42 - so repeat password for MySQL so once
01:45 - again I will give the
01:48 - password and click enter and now
01:54 - your MySQL server will complete
01:58 - installing
02:12 - it will also install MySQL client so you
02:15 - can query the database so when you
02:19 - install myql server the client
02:23 - is install with this package right so
02:26 - you don't need to install the client SE
02:31 - separately so once
02:33 - your MySQL server is installed you can
02:37 - see here the process now taking place
02:40 - and everything is configured right now
02:43 - now once again I go to my terminal and I
02:46 - will check if uh it's really installed
02:48 - so just I will
02:51 - type my
02:53 - SQ SQL and press enter and you can see
02:58 - the my SQL is installed and you can
03:02 - query your database from here
03:06 - right so first of all we will see what
03:10 - what are the databases present in the
03:13 - MySQL by default so I will right here
03:19 - show databases and I will close this by
03:22 - a semicolon and I press okay Enter and
03:27 - by default I have information schema and
03:30 - test schema databases present but these
03:34 - are only the databases which you can see
03:40 - uh and you need to give your password
03:44 - with this uh MySQL command in order to
03:47 - see the full uh list of
03:51 - databases so if you want full access to
03:54 - the MySQL server I will just quit my
03:58 - program once again
04:00 - and with this MySQL command I will give
04:05 - user root and password so just give this
04:11 - command to uh have the Privileges of
04:15 - super user so write MySQL minus U and
04:18 - then your username which is by default
04:21 - root d space- p and click enter and it
04:26 - will ask for your
04:28 - password so I'm give my password for the
04:31 - MySQL right not
04:34 - your uh computer password so I will
04:38 - write my
04:39 - password and now it's open with the
04:43 - super user privileges once again I give
04:46 - show databases and now you will be able
04:49 - to see more list of database right
04:53 - because you are now have the Privileges
04:56 - of super user so that's it
05:00 - this is how you can install MySQL server
05:02 - on your on your uh open to operating
05:06 - system in the coming video I will also
05:08 - show you how to install MySQL workbench
