00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video we will see what does final
00:05 - keyword do in Java so for example I have
00:10 - a class called hello and I Define a
00:13 - variable public final int number and I
00:19 - have added final to uh the variable
00:23 - declaration what does this final
00:26 - declaration do in front of any variable
00:31 - declaration or in front of class
00:33 - declaration or even in front of method
00:36 - declaration they have different meaning
00:39 - whenever you add it with the variable or
00:41 - a method or a class so let's see what
00:46 - does this keyword mean so the final
00:49 - keyword has numerous way to use when we
00:53 - use final keyword with a class this
00:57 - class cannot be
00:58 - subclassed when you use final with a
01:03 - method this method cannot be overridden
01:06 - by a
01:07 - subass and when you use final with a
01:11 - variable it can only be initialized once
01:16 - okay
01:17 - so first of all we will see this point
01:21 - that if you declare a variable as final
01:25 - it can only be initialized once okay so
01:29 - I have declared
01:30 - uh me member variable which is public
01:34 - final int number
01:36 - and what's here written it can only be
01:40 - initialized once right so for example I
01:45 - declare a Constructor with the same name
01:49 - and I'm going to initialize this value
01:53 - in my Constructor so number is equal to
01:59 - 10 okay so we I have initialized it only
02:04 - once right now I will uh create an
02:08 - instance of this class in my main method
02:11 - hello is equal to or hello
02:16 - H is equal to new
02:20 - hello and what I'm going to do is I'm
02:24 - trying I will try to assign the value to
02:28 - this number do number once again right
02:33 - so for example 20 okay and when I run
02:37 - this program or compile the program it
02:40 - gives me error and the error says the
02:43 - final field hello. number cannot be
02:46 - assigned right so once I assign this
02:51 - variable which is final then I
02:55 - cannot initialize it once again okay so
02:59 - if I comment this this will compile
03:03 - perfectly fine so it has compiled
03:06 - perfectly fine but if I try to
03:09 - reinitialize or reassign a value to a
03:13 - final variable then it's not allowed so
03:18 - generally you whatever uh value or
03:21 - whatever variable you want to declare it
03:25 - as a constant you can add final keybo
03:29 - keyword before this
03:32 - okay
03:33 - now the first point the final class
03:37 - cannot be subclassed when we will learn
03:41 - about inheritance we will also learn
03:44 - about what is
03:46 - subclassing and what the subclassing
03:49 - means is you can have the properties of
03:53 - one class into another class by the
03:56 - means of inheritance so for example I
03:59 - have have the student class which whose
04:03 - property I want to use it or property or
04:06 - member variables or member method inside
04:09 - my hello class I can use it like
04:14 - extends and then student class not this
04:18 - one
04:18 - [Music]
04:21 - but student not this but this student
04:28 - right and this is totally fine if you
04:30 - write extend student this means that we
04:33 - are inheriting from student class to
04:36 - hello class and this inheritance we will
04:39 - learn in the further video but I want to
04:41 - show you what this final keyword mean
04:44 - right and when we compile the
04:47 - program it will give us the error and
04:51 - what is the error
04:53 - final cannot be initialized let's
04:56 - comment this and then once
04:58 - again
05:00 - compile the program and it compiles
05:02 - totally fine right because student class
05:06 - is not final right so if you add this
05:10 - final keyword before the Declaration of
05:13 - a class for example I will write public
05:16 - class student instead of public class
05:19 - student I write public final class
05:21 - student final class student so I have
05:25 - made this class as final right so if I
05:30 - made this class as final now see what
05:33 - happens it shows whenever I compile the
05:36 - program it will show error and what is
05:39 - the error here the type hello cannot
05:43 - subclass the final class student okay so
05:47 - whenever you declare a class as final
05:50 - you cannot subclass it from it yeah okay
05:55 - so you cannot extend from that class
05:59 - okay
06:02 - okay and the point in the middle that
06:06 - the final method cannot be overridden by
06:10 - the subass this we will learn when we
06:14 - learn how to use inheritance and how to
06:18 - use overriding in a class okay so just
06:23 - remember these three uh key key
06:26 - sentences and you will be good to go I
06:28 - hope you have enjoyed this video video
06:29 - please RIT comment and subscribe and bye
06:31 - for now
