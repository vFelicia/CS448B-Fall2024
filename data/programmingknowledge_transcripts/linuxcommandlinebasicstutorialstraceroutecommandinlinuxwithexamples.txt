00:00 - now in this video we are going to talk
00:01 - about the most important command that is
00:03 - the trace root command ok
00:04 - so now in this video we will discuss
00:06 - about this particular command so before
00:08 - starting the actual implementation of
00:10 - this command let me discuss with you the
00:12 - like basics of this Trace root command
00:15 - okay
00:16 - so what are the basics of Trace root
00:18 - command as the name subject suggests
00:20 - Trace root what does it mean it just
00:23 - means you are tracing a root okay uh
00:26 - just uh think like an example like you
00:29 - have to go from like uh Mumbai to
00:33 - Bangalore okay so you can go from
00:35 - different routes and you will first
00:37 - Trace like how you can go to that
00:39 - destination okay so Trace suit is a
00:43 - command which is used to find the what
00:45 - are the number of hopes hopes means you
00:48 - can say number of routers which are
00:50 - included between your source and the
00:53 - destination okay so we will start with
00:56 - this so basically uh actually I have an
00:58 - image for you also like Suppose there is
01:01 - a source and this is the destination and
01:04 - these are the number of routers included
01:06 - between the source and destination okay
01:09 - which will tell you like what are the
01:12 - number of hopes present between source
01:14 - and destination like in our this today's
01:16 - implementation we will see uh like
01:20 - [Music]
01:22 - the number of Hoops which will be uh
01:25 - included between all this local machine
01:28 - and the
01:30 - google.com Okay so for the in Ubuntu
01:34 - actually trace route uh
01:36 - does not come with pre-installed so we
01:38 - will need to install it like if you hit
01:40 - this command then you will get uh this
01:43 - error message or you will get a
01:44 - suggestion too
01:46 - first enter this command to install
01:48 - Tracer so we will do this sudo apt
01:51 - install Tracer deputy just a packet
01:53 - manager you can say okay
01:56 - and password
01:58 - [Music]
02:01 - and now it will install your Trace root
02:03 - command okay
02:05 - so it will take a little bit of time
02:11 - let's wait for it
02:14 - so it's also just like a trace root
02:16 - command just also you can say like a
02:18 - ping command okay like we can use it
02:20 - also for checking the weather uh the
02:24 - particular server or particular host is
02:25 - reachable or not
02:27 - okay so uh now we will start with the
02:31 - Trace root command again so first of all
02:34 - uh I will create a screen and I hope it
02:36 - is visible to you so Trace root
02:39 - google.com
02:41 - okay
02:43 - so here you can see the first uh four
02:46 - page
02:49 - 10.0.2.1 it's like basically the
02:53 - uh what you can say
02:55 - gateway address like the first address
02:59 - through which my PC is getting connected
03:02 - and the star means like it is whether we
03:05 - are not getting any response or
03:07 - something like that
03:09 - okay
03:12 - so here you can see we didn't get any
03:14 - kind of response I don't know why uh
03:17 - this is it's showing me star star and
03:20 - the star means unreachable host so you
03:22 - can say like uh or not on reachable it
03:26 - means like you are not getting response
03:28 - okay and the maximum hopes uh can be it
03:31 - will try for 30.
03:34 - okay uh let me again check whether my
03:38 - internet is working or not
03:39 - okay internet is working fine
03:43 - okay
03:44 - five packet transmitter five receive
03:46 - zero percent loss
03:48 - let me try with again Trace fruit with a
03:51 - DNS server let me try
03:55 - first gateway
03:56 - [Music]
03:59 - again same that star means like not
04:02 - responding
04:05 - uh here you can see the maximum of hops
04:08 - can be 30.
04:10 - okay
04:12 - I'll do it that should show something
04:15 - [Music]
04:18 - okay let's hope
04:23 - [Music]
04:27 - okay so it's still uh as trick so it's
04:31 - not Instagram not getting response
04:33 - okay let me check the network setting
04:35 - here
04:38 - okay it's some Breeze adapter
04:42 - okay
04:45 - uh let me try again
04:48 - Trace root
04:51 - google.com
04:54 - first just get it okay yeah now now we
04:56 - are getting here you can see from second
04:58 - and third hopefully we are not getting
05:00 - any kind of response so astric basically
05:03 - means uh we are not getting any response
05:07 - from that particular router or you can
05:09 - say oops okay
05:11 - so now here you can see the first
05:13 - gateway like Gateway and Gateway just
05:16 - means like though
05:17 - very first router or very first uh you
05:22 - can say what you call the gate like
05:24 - through which your packet will pass like
05:26 - the very first router you can say
05:28 - Gateway just like a your first router
05:31 - okay suppose you are connected to a
05:33 - hotspot okay then your phone will be off
05:37 - it will act as a first router okay first
05:39 - gateway or whether your phone is
05:42 - connected to the your ISP or anything
05:45 - else you can say or just take an example
05:48 - of your Wi-Fi
05:49 - if you're connected to a Wi-Fi then the
05:52 - first request will be passed through
05:53 - your Wi-Fi then it will connect it to
05:56 - some another router then another router
05:57 - then another option okay then finally
05:59 - you will reach to the
06:01 - destination
06:03 - so here you can see uh we are getting
06:04 - many results here like
06:06 - uh I think we have covered
06:11 - approx of 14 hopes here okay let's check
06:16 - whether it will come in one line let me
06:19 - increase this okay
06:21 - I think now it's better yeah
06:24 - uh so now here you can see the first
06:27 - gateway like from which we are getting
06:30 - the response
06:33 - and these are the time like uh what you
06:35 - can say uh
06:38 - ground trip times like uh from
06:41 - like when we go and then when we come
06:44 - back then the overall time okay so here
06:48 - you can see uh the different IP
06:49 - addresses of different routers then the
06:52 - total time taken by them
06:54 - these are all the details you can see
06:57 - and at the last here you can see we
06:59 - reached to the destination
07:01 - okay
07:02 - and
07:04 - okay wait is to the destination
07:08 - yes
07:09 - so it overall take 84.1 for one
07:12 - millisecond
07:13 - [Music]
07:15 - okay
07:16 - so uh again let me try with uh some
07:19 - other uh website like let's take a IBM
07:23 - ibm.com
07:27 - foreign
07:29 - [Music]
07:38 - [Music]
07:41 - taking much time
07:45 - so here you can see you are getting
07:47 - different uh
07:50 - IP addresses of different routers okay
07:56 - let's wait
08:03 - okay so we have covered seven ropes
08:10 - 10 11 12 13 we are not getting any kind
08:13 - of response
08:14 - again no no response no response we're
08:18 - getting
08:20 - oh my God okay
08:22 - uh maximum hope is 30 so I don't think
08:25 - it will get complete
08:29 - okay
08:32 - okay no problem
08:34 - let me think about some other website uh
08:39 - Which is popular one uh let's take
08:43 - which website should I take man
08:50 - Trace food
08:53 - uh
08:55 - let me search for a new website
09:04 - booking.com okay let's check for
09:06 - booking.com
09:12 - booking.com
09:16 - [Music]
09:32 - I hope we should reach
09:41 - like here you can see like all this line
09:44 - represents the information about that
09:45 - particular house like the fifth one is
09:48 - the type address of that hope is this
09:51 - like two two three Dot 196.2.5
09:54 - foreign
09:56 - okay
09:59 - [Music]
10:01 - and also it shows us the round trip time
10:04 - rounded up I hope you got it like uh
10:07 - from sending packet to receiving back
10:10 - like from requesting to response
10:13 - okay this is the round trip time
10:19 - so here you can see we have got still uh
10:21 - seven hopes
10:23 - uh let's wait
10:27 - let's eat now
10:48 - okay I think we have reached
10:52 - like we're getting this booking.com so
10:56 - approximately we have reached
11:01 - [Music]
11:03 - okay now it will get
11:07 - yeah completed
11:10 - okay so here we are not getting any kind
11:12 - of responses from the particular uh what
11:16 - you can say
11:18 - particular hopes why it happens it may
11:21 - be because of um they are unresponsive
11:23 - or they are turned off or whether it's
11:24 - also because of the firewall regions
11:26 - like some of the firewalls does not
11:28 - reply back to this ping request or icmp
11:31 - packet app here also interested also we
11:34 - are sending that that icmp packet like
11:36 - internal what the what was the full form
11:39 - that it is internet control message
11:41 - protocol yeah we can say it like that
11:43 - okay so some of the routers are not
11:46 - routers some of the firewalls does not
11:47 - reply back to those packets that's why
11:49 - we are getting this it may be a one kind
11:51 - of region or whether they are the
11:53 - turnover we don't know okay but still
11:56 - here you can see we have approximately
11:58 - released because the head I can see the
12:01 - domain name of their of their website
12:03 - that is booking.com okay
12:07 - so it will be one of the reason
12:10 - uh also we can use uh some different
12:13 - options with this stress root command
12:14 - like hyphen n options for like better
12:16 - view let's try uh with hyphen and what
12:20 - looks like let's try okay
12:27 - [Music]
12:28 - okay now damn
12:31 - as you can see like uh as soon like very
12:35 - fast we got the result
12:38 - so you can see 192
12:42 - uh first hope second third on responsive
12:46 - one not eight dot
12:50 - 170.248.211 whether it is the
12:53 - our last node uh let me check with ping
12:57 - I don't think because it started with
12:59 - 142 yeah
13:01 - okay so this is not the address which we
13:04 - are expecting
13:06 - [Music]
13:07 - um
13:09 - but
13:11 - 142.251 okay
13:14 - so here it should show me that
13:16 - particular
13:17 - like the last IP address
13:21 - I was expecting this address
13:24 - okay let's try with uh
13:31 - other website
13:33 - yahoo.com
13:36 - not Yahoo it's Yahoo
13:41 - okay I have not used hyphen and option
13:44 - let me use that
13:48 - [Music]
13:54 - [Music]
13:55 - okay so here also we can see like 74.60
13:59 - Dot like uh
14:03 - here you can see the first and Octane
14:05 - and second octet is same then
14:08 - we can we are in
14:10 - in the network we can say like that
14:14 - okay
14:15 - so basically like this would come and
14:17 - just to use to find a number of hopes
14:19 - which
14:21 - um lies between the source and the
14:23 - destination okay
14:25 - so we are getting a strike and not
14:27 - getting responses just because of their
14:29 - firewall uh settings like uh
14:32 - it shows us the like don't reply to the
14:35 - icmb packet equipment maybe for the
14:37 - security regions uh because uh there is
14:40 - a tool in our Linux or Kali Linux system
14:42 - that is the nmap which we use for the
14:45 - network scanning okay
14:46 - so we also face that error now because
14:51 - when we go with the network testing then
14:54 - in that case we basically get that error
14:58 - so that's why uh no any company or no
15:01 - any organization want
15:03 - to uh what we can say they don't want to
15:06 - replace anyone
15:08 - you can say like that
15:10 - okay so that's all for today's video
15:12 - guys and I hope you liked it and yeah if
15:14 - you have any queries then please ask us
15:17 - in the comment section yeah but before
15:18 - ending this video I have to
15:21 - show you one more thing for you like for
15:23 - Windows
15:25 - I know it's still uh in a series but uh
15:28 - day suit is a command which we can use
15:30 - on both windows and the Linux but in
15:33 - Windows we just use this one Trace CRT
15:37 - and again let's enter google.com
15:41 - and here you can see the first hope it
15:43 - is taking 32 to
15:45 - millisecond 2 millisecond and the IP
15:47 - address the IP address of the first
15:49 - stroke
15:51 - okay
15:53 - so let's wait for some time
15:57 - it I don't think it will take much time
15:59 - uh okay for second hop request timed out
16:04 - again yeah yeah
16:09 - I will take this I don't think more than
16:11 - 15 seconds now
16:15 - so here also it is just sending the htmp
16:18 - packet request
16:20 - okay when we will start with the
16:22 - networking if in future then you will
16:25 - get to know about the what are the
16:26 - different protocols used
16:28 - okay like for web we use HTTP https
16:33 - protocol and also we use different uh
16:36 - for remote connectivity we use SSH FTP
16:40 - so we will learn all about these like
16:42 - how we can do with all these in our DX
16:45 - operating system
16:49 - let's wait
16:53 - [Music]
16:58 - now eight hops
17:01 - I think in Windows it's working fine
17:05 - um
17:12 - now nine
17:14 - it is unresponsive Maybe
17:16 - [Music]
17:18 - yeah two straight three and the third
17:20 - one will come up yeah
17:22 - and the tenth one is here
17:26 - let's check what will be the IP address
17:28 - of this
17:36 - k123
17:42 - I just want to ask you one question like
17:44 - do you know about the uh IPv6 address if
17:48 - yes then yeah please comment
17:51 - comment about this IP address about IPv6
17:54 - address
17:54 - [Music]
17:55 - Okay so
17:59 - okay finally I think we have reached to
18:02 - the destination with the number of hopes
18:05 - is 14 okay yeah now now here you can see
18:08 - uh this is
18:11 - 142.250.192.46 it is the same IP address
18:15 - and the destination IP address is also
18:18 - the same okay so in this way uh we are
18:22 - getting uh like the number of different
18:25 - hopes like uh we started from first and
18:28 - till 14 we reached to that our
18:31 - particular destination so this is the
18:34 - beauty of this command okay so I hope
18:37 - you like this because at the end we got
18:40 - our like particular result like required
18:43 - result because it will show the like
18:46 - exact uh utility of this command like uh
18:51 - uh we are requesting for this and still
18:55 - again we are getting the same thing like
18:57 - we are getting the destination address
19:00 - the same as the IP address okay
19:03 - so that's all guys so if you have any
19:04 - query then please ask
