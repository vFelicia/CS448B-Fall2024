00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:02 - we'll be working on the loops okay so
00:04 - basically today we will start with the
00:05 - for Loop and actually there are
00:07 - different types of Loops but before that
00:09 - let me first create the file that is the
00:11 - for Loop dot sh
00:13 - so for Loop dot sh okay so now we are
00:17 - done let me just add this C Bank okay so
00:20 - let me just first discuss about you the
00:22 - what is the loop suppose if you want to
00:23 - do some task that is the there that like
00:27 - exist there is some kind of repetition
00:28 - of thing suppose uh like if you have
00:31 - watched the meme like uh uh boyfriend
00:33 - send her girlfriend like I love you
00:35 - hundred times hundred times so what is
00:36 - this thing this is basically a loop okay
00:39 - so Loop is nothing but you can say like
00:42 - in kind of definition like uh what you
00:44 - can say
00:45 - um iterations okay like doing one thing
00:49 - again and again and again okay so
00:51 - suppose let me first tell me with an
00:53 - example suppose uh
00:56 - in some cases like suppose if you got
00:59 - some punishment and you have to write
01:01 - sorry for a teacher and your teacher
01:04 - says like you have to write the sorry a
01:07 - hundred times and all those things or
01:09 - five times
01:10 - so uh similarly what you will do you
01:12 - will oh sorry
01:15 - you will do like this like Eco sorry if
01:18 - you don't know the loop and all those
01:20 - things you will write just like this
01:21 - sorry sorry sorry and like you will just
01:25 - simply copy and paste things okay
01:27 - so this is what is this this is the
01:30 - repetition of the same thing so this
01:33 - repetition is managed by or removed by
01:36 - the loops okay so basically there are
01:39 - the three types of loop that is the for
01:42 - Loop
01:43 - while loop
01:45 - anti-loop okay I will be discussing all
01:48 - these two Loops in our further videos
01:50 - but now in this video we'll be working
01:52 - only on the for Loop okay so let's start
01:54 - with the first thing uh but before that
01:57 - uh I will create one array okay and I'll
02:00 - be working on that first okay
02:03 - so let me create an array and in this I
02:06 - will use the loop okay
02:09 - so I will just create with some
02:14 - languages name like python
02:18 - C plus plus
02:21 - Java
02:23 - and see and yeah like comma is not
02:27 - required
02:30 - okay so but before that let me just
02:32 - print the uh these arrays so everything
02:35 - nice I can like check everything is
02:38 - working fine or not okay
02:40 - my area and I will just provide asterisk
02:43 - here and I will just give the certain
02:45 - permission for this file that is the
02:47 - tool
02:48 - CH mode plus X12 okay
02:53 - dot slash 12 okay
02:56 - so here you can see the power this ad is
02:59 - working fine okay
03:01 - and so now what I will do I have to just
03:04 - uh print this array using the for Loop
03:07 - okay how you can do it but before that
03:09 - let me tell you first about the syntaxes
03:11 - and all those things of for Loop so the
03:14 - basic Syntax for Loop is like this for
03:17 - parenthesis here the initialization will
03:19 - be there initialization here will be the
03:22 - condition
03:23 - if you know I was the C programming or
03:26 - Java programming then that or CPP so
03:28 - it's very easy for you to understand
03:29 - this okay but if you don't do then also
03:33 - you can get it right now okay and here
03:35 - will be the increment or decrement
03:38 - okay and the two curly braces like this
03:40 - okay
03:42 - so what is this is the Syntax for for
03:45 - Loop
03:49 - okay
03:51 - so uh let me tell you how the thing
03:53 - works okay so suppose uh I want to print
03:56 - uh sorry uh like this number of times
03:59 - five times
04:00 - so I will uh start with the zero or one
04:04 - it's all upon you and I will provide the
04:06 - condition like uh that I will create one
04:10 - variable at I equal to 0 and I will
04:11 - provide the condition that is I less
04:13 - than 5
04:14 - and I plus plus okay
04:17 - so uh let me just open up my pane so I
04:20 - can like you you should visualize that
04:23 - thing okay
04:26 - so
04:30 - where is text yeah
04:33 - so here simply I write on for Loop that
04:35 - is I equal to 0 I should less than six
04:40 - or five if you're starting for
04:44 - this one
04:46 - from zero okay
04:49 - so this is the for Loop okay and I will
04:51 - just Echo here the sorry statement okay
04:56 - so here now what you have to think is
04:58 - like how the things are working okay
05:02 - so let me just uh
05:05 - do like this okay so how things are
05:07 - working basically so so when your Loop
05:10 - will run so how it runs so it will
05:12 - change it will first assign I value 0 if
05:16 - I equal to 0
05:17 - okay it will check the uh condition so I
05:22 - here I will just Define the titles for
05:25 - them
05:26 - uh here I will do initialization here
05:30 - will be the condition and
05:33 - here will be the increment okay so by
05:37 - increment we call here I am using the I
05:39 - plus plus it simply means it will
05:41 - increase and increment the value of I by
05:43 - 1.
05:44 - okay so now here what we I will do so
05:47 - you can see the one like right now there
05:49 - is I equal to 0 okay so it will now
05:53 - first check the condition whether I is
05:55 - less than 5 this one so yeah 0 is less
05:59 - than 5 so if condition is true it will
06:02 - print the sorry so here in this case 0
06:06 - less than 5 condition is true
06:08 - okay and it will what it will do it will
06:11 - print okay so here I will do like print
06:15 - what it is printing
06:17 - so it is printing sorry and then again
06:19 - it will increment the value of
06:22 - I2 I plus plus that is now the value of
06:25 - I will become 1 okay so here again I
06:30 - will give like here this I equal to 1 so
06:32 - again it will check whether one less
06:34 - than five yeah one less than five true
06:36 - it will print sorry
06:38 - okay and again it will increment the
06:41 - value to 2 okay now again Loop will run
06:45 - for two like I will be 2 and it will
06:48 - check whether a 2 less than five yeah
06:50 - two less than 5 condition is true
06:53 - and it will print sorry again and I will
06:57 - become increase by 1 from here like I
07:00 - will be 3.
07:02 - Okay so
07:05 - similarly again I will be 3 here and it
07:08 - will check like 3 less than five yeah
07:11 - condition is true
07:12 - so what it will do like it will print
07:16 - sorry
07:17 - okay and again the value of I will get
07:20 - increased by 1 that is 4
07:22 - and again uh now it will do I will be 4
07:27 - and it will check let me just increase
07:29 - this size here
07:32 - I equal to 4 okay and it will do whether
07:36 - 4 less than 5 yeah it's less than 5
07:38 - condition is true
07:40 - and it will print sorry first
07:43 - and then it will increment the value of
07:47 - I to 5 okay and now I will become 5 and
07:52 - it will check whether 5 less than 5
07:55 - so here condition is false and what will
07:58 - happen Loop field and okay and it will
08:03 - print sorry five times okay if you're
08:07 - starting your loop from
08:10 - from zero
08:12 - okay
08:14 - so this is the simple uh working of the
08:17 - four Loop like how things are working so
08:19 - now let me just tell you about with the
08:21 - experiment part how you can get it okay
08:23 - so let me just open up this one and I
08:27 - will just comment of these things
08:30 - okay
08:31 - and for Loop and I will initialize the
08:35 - value of I from 0 to I less than 5
08:39 - because I have to print 5 times I plus
08:41 - plus
08:43 - sorry
08:44 - okay
08:46 - okay just Ctrl s to save again let me
08:50 - run the script which number it is 12
08:53 - okay
08:54 - it's not this one sorry
08:57 - yeah so here you can see five times
09:00 - already has been printed okay but what
09:03 - if you want uh like if you do less than
09:06 - equal to 5 so in this case suppose less
09:11 - than equal to 5 so it will print to you
09:13 - uh it will print 6 times
09:16 - so here you can see six times have
09:18 - dependent why why this happened because
09:20 - at this point now if there is less than
09:24 - equal to so here the condition is
09:27 - satisfied like yeah 4 5 is less than
09:29 - equal to 5 so condition is satisfied
09:32 - satisfying and it will be true and solid
09:35 - will get printed and then
09:37 - solid will be printed and then I will be
09:40 - equal to 6 and now if you will check it
09:43 - will check the condition that is 6 less
09:45 - than 5 so that condition is false so in
09:48 - this case our Loop will get end and you
09:51 - will come out of the loop
09:53 - okay
09:54 - so in this way uh for Loop works I hope
09:57 - you got it and let me just tell you one
10:00 - more thing like how things work and like
10:02 - there is also uh some different syntax
10:04 - of for Loop okay so the difference
10:08 - intake is this like this uh for uh VAR
10:12 - suppose you have to provide some list
10:14 - like uh
10:16 - like you can do like this for I in and
10:19 - you will provide a list like one two
10:22 - three four five six seven eight nine ten
10:26 - you can do like this also okay or you
10:29 - can provide some any other variables
10:32 - also like you can provide string names
10:34 - also and all those things
10:36 - and here you will just do do okay and in
10:42 - this what you will do I will just print
10:44 - like this eco
10:46 - iteration
10:49 - colon and here I will just write the I
10:53 - okay and then you will write here
10:56 - done
10:57 - do done okay Ctrl s to save I will just
11:01 - comment out this this Loop and again I
11:04 - will just run this script okay
11:07 - so here you can see the iteration I is
11:10 - printed not the value okay so at that
11:15 - point I will just provide the dollar
11:17 - okay
11:21 - yeah so here you can see iteration one
11:24 - let me just uh clear the screen and
11:26 - again run the script so here you can see
11:28 - one two three four five six seven eight
11:30 - nine ten okay so in this also you can
11:33 - run Loop suppose uh if you want to do
11:35 - some operation of if one comes or like
11:39 - suppose I provide here some different
11:41 - lists like the name list suppose I push
11:44 - iuc okay
11:47 - so here uh
11:50 - suppose if you want to uh
11:53 - do like this if
11:56 - and the condition which you will give
11:58 - like dollar I equal equal to
12:02 - I use
12:04 - so and that's in this case what you
12:07 - should do like
12:10 - then
12:14 - eco
12:15 - uh what should we Echo like um
12:19 - you can equal like yeah uh
12:23 - like this
12:24 - ayushi is a good boy
12:28 - okay and you have to just uh write uh
12:33 - what you can say close the if condition
12:36 - I will save it and I will just run this
12:41 - so here it is showing some kind of error
12:44 - like uh unexpected token then at line
12:46 - number
12:48 - 29 oh wait a minute I have whether uh
12:53 - let me write like this first and I will
12:56 - do it in the colon not colon
13:03 - okay why it's showing error I'm not
13:05 - getting
13:06 - [Music]
13:14 - uh let me just uh if
13:19 - if dollar I equal equal to ayush then
13:22 - eco
13:25 - free
13:27 - yeah it's correct
13:31 - uh wait a minute
13:36 - okay so uh basically I got it so here
13:39 - you have to just provide one space so I
13:42 - was doing just some silly mistakes so
13:44 - let me again run this script uh clear
13:46 - dot slash yeah so here you can see uh
13:50 - sorry which skip that in
13:52 - I have to run 12 sorry
13:55 - 12 okay so here you can see I used to
13:57 - the good boy so if dollar I equal equal
13:59 - to I use then it is printing like yeah
14:01 - ayush is a good boy okay so I can do
14:04 - right right uh right like this like
14:06 - dollar I okay so it will also run
14:11 - so I should say goodbye okay in this
14:13 - case you can see so uh basically you can
14:15 - uh whatever you I was saying uh you can
14:19 - just initialize or write your for Loop
14:22 - in the syntax also okay
14:25 - so uh if you are familiar with the C
14:27 - programming or CPP then that is very
14:29 - easy for you and if you are for uh same
14:31 - like familiar with python then this one
14:34 - is also fine for you okay
14:36 - so uh now let me tell you first about uh
14:39 - how you can print the array elements
14:41 - okay so in our previous classes we have
14:43 - learned about array so here you can see
14:45 - I have created array here let me just
14:46 - create it below
14:49 - I will comment out this and uh
14:53 - I will just
14:56 - create array and I will just add some
14:59 - other language also like
15:01 - kotlin I will add and some other framers
15:06 - like reactor
15:07 - JavaScript
15:11 - shell scripting okay
15:14 - so this is my array okay so now I have
15:17 - to print this array okay using for Loop
15:19 - so how will you will print an ad using
15:21 - for you so basically we will need to
15:23 - define the uh condition like array
15:27 - should be less than the size minus one
15:29 - so here what is the size of the ad that
15:31 - is one two three four five six seven
15:34 - eight so zero to seven we have to do so
15:37 - in this case you will use the normal
15:39 - Loop that we use in for in other
15:41 - programming language that I equal to 0 I
15:44 - should be less than 7 and I plus plus
15:48 - and we will just Echo the indexes okay
15:51 - so how you will do it
15:54 - my add-in name and I will provide the
15:57 - index as I
15:59 - and we are good to go now let me just
16:02 - run the script
16:03 - yeah here you can see all the ad
16:05 - elements has been printed in this in the
16:08 - same order okay
16:10 - so that's it for today guys I hope you
16:12 - liked it like how the for Loop works and
16:15 - you like this representation also like
16:18 - everything should be clear for you if
16:19 - you have any problem then please ask to
16:22 - me
16:23 - okay so that's all for this guys and I
16:25 - will add this code in our GitHub
16:27 - repository you can access from there and
16:28 - provide the link in the description so
16:30 - thank you guys for watching this video
16:31 - and I'll meet you in the next video
16:33 - thank you
