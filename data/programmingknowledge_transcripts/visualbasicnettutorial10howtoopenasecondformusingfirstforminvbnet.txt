00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to link a
00:05 - second form with your first form so
00:08 - suppose you want to open a second form
00:11 - using your first form by clicking a
00:14 - button for example how can you achieve
00:17 - this using Visual Basic I will show you
00:20 - today so let's get
00:23 - started first of all I will create a
00:26 - second form right now I only have one
00:29 - form which is form one and to make
00:33 - create a second form I will go to my
00:35 - project so this is my project I will
00:38 - right click my project and I will say
00:41 - add new
00:44 - item and it will open a file dialogue
00:48 - and then from here I can
00:53 - choose my Windows Form application so go
00:56 - to Windows Form and choose Windows Form
01:01 - here and you can change the name of your
01:03 - form also and I will uh leave it as
01:07 - default but you can change the form name
01:10 - right now it's form two and
01:13 - add so once you click add button a new
01:18 - form is added to your
01:21 - project so now let's add uh some kind of
01:27 - uh
01:28 - label to your form form and let's change
01:32 - the text of the form
01:36 - as second
01:40 - form and let's uh change the font size
01:44 - also so we can see that it's a second
01:51 - form so I will give it bold and let's
01:56 - say
01:58 - it's 26
02:00 - okay so this is our second form now how
02:04 - can we open this form using our first
02:08 - form so I will go to the first form and
02:12 - I will take a button this is a really
02:15 - simple way to open a second form from
02:18 - first form and what I need to do is I
02:21 - will I have to just click this button
02:24 - double click it and I have to say
02:29 - form
02:34 - 2
02:38 - dot
02:40 - show and give these brackets and that's
02:45 - it now when you run your
02:50 - program and when you click this button
02:52 - it will open the second form for you
02:57 - okay so it's that that much easy to
03:01 - connect to form using Visual Basic I
