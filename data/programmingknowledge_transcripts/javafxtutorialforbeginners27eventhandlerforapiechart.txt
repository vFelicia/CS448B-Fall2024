00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how to use pie
00:06 - chart in Java effects and I have given
00:09 - you this example in which I have shown
00:11 - you how to create a pie chart and how to
00:14 - work with some of the important
00:16 - properties in pie chart now in this
00:18 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:20 - deal with events in pie charts so for
00:24 - example you want to you know mouse click
00:26 - on some section of this pie chart and
00:29 - you want to perform some events for from
00:32 - clicking a mouse or any other event on
00:36 - this section right and what we want to
00:40 - achieve here is for example you want to
00:42 - display the percentage of this section
00:46 - in a label when I click on this section
00:50 - right so let's see how we can do this so
00:55 - first of all what I'm going to do is I'm
00:56 - going to open my main dot F XML file in
00:59 - the scene builder and in here in the
01:03 - last video I've shown you how to add
01:04 - this pie chart control and the button
01:07 - now in here what I'm going to do is I'm
01:10 - going to go to controls here and I'm
01:12 - going to take a label first of all and
01:15 - then I'm going to just so resize it and
01:19 - maybe I am going to change the font size
01:22 - of this label also so first of all
01:25 - remove the text and then change the font
01:29 - size to for example
01:31 - 24 and let's change the color also to
01:36 - red okay so now what I'm going to do is
01:41 - I'm going to give some ID to this label
01:43 - so I will go to the code and in here I
01:46 - will just say status here and then I
01:51 - will save this F XML file and refresh my
01:56 - project and now I will go to my main
01:59 - controller dot Java a class in which I
02:02 - have created this method called a button
02:05 - to listen to the button action right so
02:08 - in here first of all I will add this
02:11 - label so
02:14 - first of all just right at the rate FX
02:17 - ml and
02:19 - then at the label
02:22 - label and our label ID is status right
02:27 - so just take the same ID from here and
02:31 - give it here and then inside your button
02:35 - method first of all let's import this
02:38 - label from here and then go inside your
02:42 - button method and after this pie chart
02:47 - set data and in here we were setting the
02:51 - list which was this observable list
02:54 - right so just after that we are going to
02:57 - add a for loop here and I will write
03:01 - final and then just write the pie chart
03:06 - dot data and give the name to your
03:11 - variable name for example data and then
03:14 - because we are setting a list to the pie
03:18 - chart then we can call this list using
03:22 - pie chart dot get data okay and this pie
03:27 - chart dot get data is going to give you
03:30 - the same list we have set to the pie
03:33 - chart right and then go inside your
03:37 - for loop and take this data variable and
03:40 - then just add get node and then just
03:47 - call add event
03:50 - handler and
03:52 - in here it takes two arguments one is
03:55 - event type and other is event handler
03:59 - right so event type you can say it can
04:02 - be a mouse event so just right mouse
04:06 - event and then just write dot and then
04:11 - you can choose one of the mouse event
04:14 - listed here it can be mouse click mouse
04:17 - dragged mouse entered exited or moved or
04:21 - anything right so just for this example
04:25 - I'm going to take mouseclicked if and
04:27 - from here okay and the second argument
04:31 - here will be the event handler okay so
04:35 - just right instead of this event handler
04:38 - just write new event
04:41 - handler search for this event handler
04:45 - method and it will be somewhere here so
04:49 - search for it here
04:51 - it is so just take this event handler
04:55 - and it's going to ask you for the
04:59 - template argument which is event so for
05:02 - us the event is Mouse event right and
05:06 - just
05:08 - you know implement this unimplemented
05:10 - method so just click this bulb here and
05:13 - it's going to show add unimplemented
05:15 - method just click it it's going to
05:18 - implement this handle method here which
05:21 - is a mouse click event right which
05:24 - listens for the mouse click so in here
05:27 - just take your label from here and then
05:32 - go to this handle method and then call a
05:36 - set text here and then we can call this
05:39 - data variable here and then it can give
05:42 - us the
05:44 - pi value so just call pi well you get PI
05:49 - value here okay but because it's going
05:51 - to give you a number then what you need
05:55 - to do is you need to convert it into the
05:57 - string so just write string dot
06:01 - value off and then inside these brackets
06:05 - just call this data dot get a PI value
06:10 - okay and because it's going to give you
06:12 - the value in percentage you can just
06:15 - write here percentage okay save your
06:20 - code and then run it once again and
06:23 - load your chart first of all and then
06:27 - when I click any section here for
06:29 - example this Java section it prints the
06:32 - value of this section for example 50
06:36 - percent okay otherwise when I click this
06:39 - see section
06:41 - prints the value of this in percentage
06:43 - or C sharp or a Python or C++ okay so it
06:48 - listens for the mouse click event for
06:52 - this section okay so in this way you can
06:56 - add some events and actions on the pie
06:59 - chart I hope you've enjoyed this video
