00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use do
00:05 - while loop and do until loop with your
00:09 - Visual Basic Windows Form application so
00:12 - I have this basic form made and I have
00:16 - this button which I have changed the
00:19 - text called while loop okay and I'm just
00:24 - double clicking this button to go into
00:26 - this button click event here I have
00:29 - declared a very iable called X as
00:32 - integer and I have initialized it with a
00:34 - value of one okay so just this one line
00:39 - I have written and which declares a
00:42 - integer X which is initialized by one
00:46 - now for making a while
00:49 - loop we write
00:52 - do and
00:56 - while and here we write a condition so
01:01 - we can
01:02 - write do
01:05 - while X is less than
01:11 - 10 when you press enter here it will
01:15 - create a auto code completion here
01:19 - called Loop and when
01:22 - you for example you want to print your
01:27 - integer in the message box
01:30 - so I'll write message box dot
01:36 - show
01:41 - and
01:44 - the value of
01:48 - x
01:50 - is and I will give the ment sign and X
01:55 - here so this code will print X until and
02:02 - unless this condition is met and for
02:06 - example we need to give some other
02:10 - conditions to increment or decrement or
02:13 - whatever you want to do with x in this
02:17 - case I'm going to use x is equal x +
02:21 - 1 and now let's try and run the
02:27 - program so when I press this
02:31 - button the value of x initializes with
02:35 - one because our first value was one and
02:38 - then it
02:39 - increases one by one until and
02:43 - unless 10 is reached until unless X is
02:48 - less than 10 right
02:52 - so this is do while loop and how it is
02:57 - different from for Loop it's different
03:00 - in one respect only which is you don't
03:04 - know the number of
03:06 - iteration uh your Loop is going to uh
03:10 - iterate and in the for Loop you
03:13 - predefine the number of iteration right
03:16 - so that is the basic
03:19 - difference now there is uh a do while
03:24 - not Loop also for example I'll write do
03:28 - while
03:30 - not then it will give me or it will
03:34 - follow the opposite of this condition X
03:38 - is less than
03:40 - 10 right so it will follow the uh this
03:45 - condition and it will keep on
03:48 - looping so for example I write X is
03:52 - greater than 10 then it will take X is
03:56 - less than 10 and it will work like
03:59 - previous Cod code for example I run the
04:02 - code
04:04 - and it's initializing by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
04:09 - 9 10 so
04:12 - while when you give not condition here
04:17 - it will act opposite of this or reverse
04:20 - of the condition you have given there is
04:23 - one
04:24 - more condition or while loop you can
04:27 - make is do un Loop okay so for
04:33 - example I write here
04:36 - [Music]
04:40 - do
04:43 - until and I give here the condition is
04:47 - equal to okay so this condition
04:52 - will occur or this Loop will keep on uh
04:57 - iterating itself and until and unless X
05:01 - reaches 10 so generally we use equal to
05:06 - sign with until and other condition with
05:11 - do while undo while not Loop okay so
05:15 - once again I run the program it will
05:18 - still do the same thing but the
05:22 - only situation changeed here is it's
05:27 - it's waiting for this condition to be
05:29 - true okay so when you have some specific
05:36 - cases then you will be able to
05:38 - understand uh and use these condition in
05:43 - a better
05:44 - manner this condition do until you
05:48 - can write like this also so you can
05:53 - write
05:55 - while
05:58 - not
06:02 - and it will still work like do until
06:04 - Loop so it's on you how you want to
06:09 - iterate your condition and how you want
06:12 - to use the loops and what is the
06:15 - situation dependent on what which you
06:18 - want to use it so I hope you have
06:21 - understood the basic concept of do while
06:24 - do until and do while not loop I hope
06:28 - you have learned some something new this
06:30 - time please write comment and subscribe
06:31 - and bye for
06:33 - now
