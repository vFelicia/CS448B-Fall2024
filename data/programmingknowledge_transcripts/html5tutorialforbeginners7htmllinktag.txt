00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using HTML 5
00:06 - in this video we will see how to use
00:09 - links in
00:11 - HTML so you may have seen links on
00:15 - almost every web page whenever you visit
00:18 - some website so for example you want to
00:21 - navigate from one page to another you
00:24 - click some link and it will redirect you
00:28 - to the other page so how to add this
00:31 - link the basic uh tag which we use for
00:35 - this link is this a tag okay or it's
00:40 - called a link tag and to add a URL or
00:45 - your file name what you need is you need
00:48 - to have a reference called hre and it's
00:52 - a attribute we want to add and in these
00:55 - double codes you give a URL name or a
01:00 - file name okay and in here you can
01:04 - provide the description of the link
01:07 - right so for example I want to give some
01:11 - uh website path here for example this is
01:15 - my website path HTTP colon and then the
01:19 - website path you want to uh you know
01:22 - redirect this page to right and here you
01:25 - can give the description to your uh link
01:29 - for example easy online converter okay
01:33 - save your code and when you refresh your
01:36 - page you will see this uh link easy
01:39 - online converter this is the description
01:42 - but behind this when you click this uh
01:45 - link it will redirect you to the website
01:49 - which we have written in the
01:51 - hre okay so like this you can replace
01:55 - this by google.com or any other website
01:58 - and in here you can give the description
02:00 - ion now you can also add some file name
02:04 - here so for example I will create a new
02:07 - HTML file inside my web content folder
02:10 - so HTML 5 and this I will name it as
02:15 - File 2 for example HTML and I will
02:18 - finish it and this creates my second
02:21 - file and I will just add some
02:23 - description here file two for example
02:27 - okay and I save it and this is the name
02:30 - of the my file file too right so when I
02:33 - want to add here the file name I can
02:37 - just directly write
02:39 - File 2 do HTML right same name as your
02:46 - file name okay and here you can write
02:50 - open File 2 and save it and refresh your
02:54 - web page and it says open file two and
02:57 - when you click it it's going to open
03:00 - your file 2 like this okay so you can
03:03 - see file 2. HTML is open okay now if
03:07 - this file is present in some folder for
03:10 - example I will create a folder inside my
03:12 - web content folder so create a folder
03:15 - and I can name it as Di and it's going
03:20 - to create a DI folder and I'm going to
03:23 - uh drag and drop my file tohtml in my
03:27 - dir folder and it's going to transfer it
03:30 - inside my di folder so now I can give
03:34 - the path
03:37 - di/ File 2 okay save it and refresh your
03:42 - web page and once again open the link
03:44 - and it's going to open the same file
03:47 - right so if you have some uh directory
03:50 - structure you can uh do it something
03:53 - like this okay now for example when you
03:58 - click this link it's it's going to open
04:01 - your uh any link or website in the same
04:05 - tab in which you are working on and for
04:08 - example you want to open it in some
04:10 - other tab for example here you want to
04:14 - uh you know let this website be opened
04:17 - but when you click this link you want to
04:19 - open your website in the other tab how
04:22 - can you do it you can do it with a
04:25 - attribute called Target and as a Target
04:28 - you give give uh value underscore blank
04:33 - okay save it and refresh your page and
04:38 - when you click this it's going to open
04:40 - your uh file to. HTML in second tab
04:45 - right so you can give Target like uh
04:50 - blank or by default itself so this is
04:54 - the default Target and you can also give
04:57 - a Target like top which opens
05:00 - the link document in the full body of
05:02 - the window okay now you can also use a
05:06 - link as a bookmark so how you can use it
05:10 - for example you have a web page which
05:14 - has many topics topic 1 2 3 4 and for
05:18 - example 100 topics on a single page and
05:22 - you want to jump from one topic to
05:26 - another topic for example from topic one
05:28 - to topic six
05:30 - directly uh when you click a link so how
05:34 - you can do it you can add a paragraph
05:36 - first and inside the paragraph you can
05:39 - add this link tag and as an attribute
05:45 - here hre you can give something like
05:49 - hash and the ID which you want to give
05:53 - it so for example
05:56 - T5 okay and then the description for
05:59 - examp example jump to topic five okay
06:05 - and same ID you just need to give in the
06:09 - heading here for example ID is equal to
06:13 - T5 so T5 something like this so this is
06:18 - the reference and this is the ID so
06:20 - whenever you click this link it's going
06:23 - to see where this T5 is and it's going
06:26 - to search this ID and it's going to jump
06:29 - to this
06:30 - topic here okay so let's save it and
06:34 - refresh our page once again and here we
06:37 - have top pick 1 2 3 and five is not even
06:41 - visible from here right so when I click
06:44 - jump to topic five is going to jump to
06:49 - topic five here okay so you can use
06:53 - links as a bookmark also so in this way
06:57 - you can use links in HTML I hope you you
