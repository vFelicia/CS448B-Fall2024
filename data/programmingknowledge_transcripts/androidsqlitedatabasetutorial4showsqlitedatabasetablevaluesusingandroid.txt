00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android s collide database
00:05 - tutorial for beginners in the last video
00:08 - we have seen how to insert data into
00:10 - SQLite database using Android in this
00:14 - video we will see how we can get all
00:17 - data from SQLite database table and show
00:22 - it on your Android so let's get started
00:26 - first of all what we are going to do is
00:29 - we are going to take a button and this
00:32 - button we are going to use to view all
00:36 - data so I'm going to change the text as
00:40 - view all and the button ID I'm also
00:45 - going to change as button now once our
00:48 - button is created what we are going to
00:50 - do is we are going to create a method to
00:53 - get all the table data so we are going
00:56 - to go to our database helper class which
00:59 - we have developed in the last videos and
01:03 - inside this database helper class what
01:07 - we are going to do is we are going to
01:09 - create a new method and this method we
01:11 - are going to call it as get all data
01:14 - which will be a public method and it's
01:17 - going to return a class or instance of a
01:20 - class called cursor and this cursor
01:23 - class we will see or what this is but
01:27 - let's create our method first so get all
01:31 - data and it's not going to take any
01:36 - argument for now and inside we will
01:40 - write a query to get all the data now
01:45 - this cursor will show some error so you
01:48 - just need to press alt enter to import
01:51 - the class which is cursor class and now
01:55 - what we are going to do is we are going
01:58 - to create the instance of database class
02:02 - just as we have done in the last video
02:05 - you can just copy this first line from
02:08 - the function insert data from the last
02:11 - video and paste it in
02:13 - this new function and then we will
02:16 - create an instance of a cursor class so
02:20 - this is our cursor class and we will
02:24 - name it as for example rs4 result and
02:28 - then we will take an instance of our
02:30 - database and then we will call a rock
02:35 - very on this database so Rock query and
02:40 - if you know how to query a SQLite
02:45 - database you may know how to query all
02:49 - the data from the table so this is a
02:52 - simple query I am going to right which
02:55 - is select all Esther extends for all
03:01 - right from your table so our table name
03:06 - is table name itself which we have
03:09 - defined in the last video so plus table
03:13 - name and then it takes an argument which
03:19 - we are going to pass it as null for now
03:22 - and now we just need to return the
03:25 - instance of this cursor which is our es
03:29 - right so return our es now you may be
03:32 - wondering what this cursor class does
03:35 - you can press ctrl and click on this
03:39 - cursor and you will reach to this cursor
03:43 - class and this cursor class is an
03:46 - interface which provides the random
03:49 - readwrite access to your result ok so
03:52 - you can see here we are querying the
03:55 - database and the result we are storing
03:58 - it in this cursor instance and using
04:03 - this we have the access to our data
04:06 - right
04:07 - so our get all data is created now we
04:10 - are going to go to our main activity dot
04:14 - Java class and in here first of all we
04:18 - will create the variable for view all
04:21 - button right if you remember we have
04:23 - created this view all button so we will
04:25 - create an instance
04:26 - for this here so
04:31 - and now we will cast this button
04:40 - now once we have casted our button we
04:44 - can use this button object to call set
04:48 - on click listener right let's create a
04:50 - method so it will be a public method and
04:54 - we will say this will return nothing and
04:58 - we will name it as view all method it
05:04 - takes no arguments and in here we can
05:09 - call the object of our view all button
05:12 - and then we can call set on click
05:15 - listener
05:16 - set on click listener and inside this we
05:20 - will create a new on click listener and
05:26 - when this button is clicked we want to
05:29 - perform some action right so what we are
05:32 - going to do here is we are going to get
05:36 - all the data using this function which
05:39 - we have just created which is get all
05:42 - data right so we will use the instance
05:45 - of our database helper class which is my
05:49 - DB which we have created dot get all
05:53 - data right and we are going to save it
05:57 - in the cursor because its returns an
05:59 - object of cursor right
06:03 - now this has some properties this object
06:07 - have some properties if we call this
06:10 - object and we can get the count of the
06:16 - lines so get count and this is the
06:20 - result count we are getting if this is
06:23 - equal to zero then it means that there
06:27 - is no data available for us right from
06:31 - this get all data by querying to the
06:35 - database and then we have to show some
06:38 - message so right now I am just writing a
06:41 - comment and we are going to create a
06:44 - method for showing message in some
06:47 - moment and then we are going to return
06:50 - if there is no result then we are going
06:53 - to show error and return otherwise if
06:57 - there is some result then we are going
07:01 - to create some string buffer and then we
07:05 - are going to display this data so we are
07:09 - going to create an instance of string
07:11 - buffer and we will name it as buffer is
07:14 - equal to new string buffer and then we
07:21 - are going to get all the data one by one
07:24 - using this re s object and how we can do
07:28 - it we can use a while loop and as a
07:34 - condition of this while loop we can take
07:37 - this re s object and we can call a
07:40 - method move to next so dot move to next
07:47 - and it moves your cursor to the next
07:50 - result okay and then we are going to get
07:54 - this result and we will store it in the
07:59 - buffer right so buffer dot append and in
08:05 - this buffer we can append the result
08:10 - okay and how we can append this we can
08:14 - write the name of our call
08:16 - so our first call name was ID and then
08:22 - this : and then plus we will use this re
08:28 - s object and then we are going to get
08:33 - the string so get string and then we
08:38 - will pass an index of the column and
08:41 - index of the column starts from zero and
08:44 - if you remember our table was containing
08:48 - four columns one was ID second was name
08:52 - third was surname and fourth was mark so
08:55 - index of ID will be zero index of name
08:59 - will be one index of surname will be two
09:03 - and index of marks will be three okay so
09:07 - that's what we are going to do so index
09:09 - of ID is zero that's why we are giving
09:12 - here zero and then we can just give or
09:18 - change the line to next and we will do
09:22 - the same for the other columns also so
09:31 - of name was one index of surname was to
09:35 - an index of marks is three and let's
09:39 - give double line-break to the last
09:43 - column so that when next data is printed
09:47 - it's printed after a line break and then
09:50 - we want to show all the data so let's
09:52 - write the comment
09:55 - so let's create a new method which will
09:57 - be also a public method and it will
10:02 - return nothing so void the method name
10:07 - will be show message it's going to take
10:14 - two argument first is the title and
10:21 - second is the message itself
10:23 - okay so string message and in here we
10:33 - are going to create an instance of alert
10:36 - deluged builder so just write alert
10:39 - dialog thought builder and we will name
10:46 - it as builder is equal to new alert
10:52 - dialog dot builder and it takes the
10:57 - argument which is the context so this
11:02 - itself and using this builder we can
11:05 - create a alert dialog okay so we can set
11:10 - our title and set message using this
11:14 - builder to alert dialog so let's create
11:19 - first of all let's use this builder to
11:23 - set cancel label so set is as cancel
11:27 - label so that we can cancel it after its
11:33 - use and then we will set the title so
11:36 - builder dot set title and title will be
11:43 - the title which we get from this
11:46 - argument and then we will set the
11:50 - message so builder dot set message and
11:55 - message will be this message which we
11:59 - will get in the argument okay and then
12:02 - we can just call show method on this
12:07 - bilder this will show our dialogue okay
12:12 - dialogue or alert dialogue so let's just
12:15 - copy this so message function here and
12:18 - first of all if no data is found what we
12:22 - are going to do is we are going to show
12:25 - some message so the title of this
12:28 - message box will be error and we will
12:34 - display nothing found or you can say no
12:42 - data found okay and when the data is
12:46 - found in here we can just show some
12:52 - message that data the dialogue title and
12:59 - the second argument will be the buffer
13:02 - and we need to convert this buffer into
13:05 - the string so just called to string on
13:08 - it okay and now our code is done one
13:13 - more thing which remains is we need to
13:15 - call this view all method inside our on
13:18 - create method so just copy this view all
13:21 - method and paste it inside your on
13:25 - create method of your main activity okay
13:30 - now let's run our program so our app is
13:36 - running now and when we click this view
13:39 - all button we will be able to see the
13:43 - data so right now we only have one
13:47 - student data so it's showing ID one and
13:51 - name surname and age and we can add some
13:56 - more data for the student
14:05 - and let's add this second student data
14:09 - here and I'm going to click this add
14:12 - data button and data is inserted and now
14:15 - view all the data and now we have two
14:19 - student data ID one and ID - ok so in
14:23 - this way you can insert some more data
14:26 - and then using this view all button you
14:28 - will be able to see all the data here so
14:33 - I hope you have enjoyed this video
