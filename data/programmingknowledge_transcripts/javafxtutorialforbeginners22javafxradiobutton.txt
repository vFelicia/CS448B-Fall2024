00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will see how to use radio
00:07 - buttons in Java fxs in the last video we
00:10 - have seen how to use checkboxes in Java
00:13 - FS so how are radio button different
00:18 - from
00:19 - checkboxes radio buttons are also used
00:23 - to choose one option out of many options
00:27 - available right and check boxes are also
00:31 - meant for the same so what is the
00:33 - difference the difference is using
00:36 - checkboxes you can choose multiple
00:38 - options but radio buttons are generally
00:41 - used to choose only one option out of
00:45 - many options so let's get started and
00:48 - let's see an example and see how we can
00:50 - use radio buttons so I have created this
00:54 - project which I named it as a radio
00:56 - button and in my application package I
00:59 - have this main. Java file in which I
01:02 - have added this main. fxml and then I
01:06 - have this main
01:08 - controller. Java class which I have
01:10 - created which is blank right now and I
01:15 - have this main. fxml file okay so uh
01:20 - this is just a blank project I think
01:24 - till now you know how to use them okay
01:27 - so first of all what I'm going to do is
01:29 - I'm going to open my main. fxml
01:33 - file and in here first of all the anchor
01:36 - pin I'm going to change the layout pref
01:40 - width and pref height to 300 and 300
01:45 - okay so pref width 300 and pref height
01:49 - is equal to 300 now what I'm going to do
01:52 - is I'm going to go to the controls and
01:54 - in here I'm will search for the radio
01:57 - buttons and for example
02:00 - I will give you an example in which
02:03 - conditions you can use radio buttons for
02:06 - example you want to allow the user to
02:08 - choose a gender of a person right so it
02:13 - can be either female or male it cannot
02:15 - be both or you want to allow the user to
02:19 - choose uh his age right so it can be
02:23 - only one age it cannot be different
02:26 - right so we are going to take an example
02:29 - of
02:30 - the gender selection male or female
02:32 - right so I'm going to take two buttons
02:34 - and I'm also going to take one label
02:37 - here and first of all I will change the
02:41 - text of uh this radio button I will go
02:43 - to the property and first radio button
02:46 - text I'm going to change it as mail and
02:50 - the second radio button option I'm going
02:52 - to change the text as
02:55 - female okay and the label I'm going to
02:58 - leave it as empty
03:01 - and uh now what I'm going to do is I
03:03 - will go to the property of uh this male
03:07 - radio button and in here you have some
03:10 - options right so let's run this or
03:14 - preview this fxml file using uh this uh
03:18 - scene Builder preview option so just go
03:20 - to preview here and then click preview
03:23 - in window and right now you can see I
03:27 - can select both of the options but this
03:32 - we don't want right we want to choose
03:34 - either male or female so we uh want to
03:38 - allow the user to choose either one of
03:40 - them and not at the same time so how do
03:42 - we do it there is a property called
03:46 - toggle Group which you can set to allow
03:50 - the user or to allow the user to choose
03:53 - from a group of radio buttons right so
03:57 - we will make a group and in that group
04:01 - we will assign the radio button one and
04:04 - radio button two to that group so that
04:07 - they will belong to a toggle group and
04:10 - then you will be able to choose only one
04:12 - option so uh I will just choose first uh
04:17 - radio button and go to the property
04:19 - called uh toggle group and you can say
04:23 - this is my group for example okay or any
04:28 - other name which you want okay so for
04:31 - now I'm going to give it my group right
04:35 - and take the same name which you have
04:37 - chosen here and then go to the second
04:40 - radio button and give the same name here
04:43 - also to the toggle group okay so the
04:46 - toggle group for male radio button and
04:49 - female radio button is same and save
04:52 - your code and let's preview it once
04:54 - again and now we cannot choose both
04:58 - radio button at the same same time only
05:00 - one is uh selected another is unselected
05:05 - okay so when I choose this female the
05:07 - male is unselected and female is
05:10 - selected okay so only one of them can be
05:13 - selected at a time right so this is due
05:17 - to this toggle button now if you uh want
05:20 - to allow the user that uh this male
05:24 - radio option is always selected you can
05:27 - choose this option called selected just
05:29 - click it and then it's uh by default
05:33 - selected so when we preview it the radio
05:36 - button will be selected where you have
05:39 - checked this option okay so right now we
05:42 - don't want that
05:44 - right now uh let's give the ID to these
05:48 - radio buttons so I will go to the code
05:51 - and select a mail radio button and I
05:53 - will name it as rb1 for radio button one
05:57 - and second radio button I will name name
05:59 - it as rb2 for radio button 2 okay and
06:04 - now I will uh connect this uh main fxml
06:08 - file with the main do controller Java
06:11 - class so I will go to the controller
06:14 - here and select application. main
06:16 - controller from here and I will save
06:19 - everything now I will go to uh my
06:22 - Eclipse IDE and refresh my project once
06:26 - again and now I will go to the main
06:29 - controller. Java class and in here first
06:32 - of all I will declare these radio
06:35 - buttons right so let's declare these
06:38 - radio buttons and the label so I have
06:41 - declared these radio buttons and the
06:43 - label and uh the name should match what
06:46 - we have provided in the fxml file so we
06:49 - have provided one first radio button as
06:51 - rb1 and second radio button as rb2 and
06:54 - we have selected one label Also let's
06:57 - import this label from here here and
07:00 - then choose the same name for the label
07:04 - and give uh select your label from here
07:07 - so we have taken this label just select
07:11 - this label and then uh give the FX ID to
07:15 - this label which you have given here so
07:18 - same name to this label here okay save
07:23 - your code and uh refresh your uh project
07:26 - once again and now we are going to
07:29 - create one method and which will be
07:33 - public void action perform method so it
07:37 - will return void and the name of uh this
07:41 - uh method we are going to name it as
07:44 - radio select and just pass this action
07:48 - event uh method here and give the name
07:52 - to your argument which is event for
07:55 - example and go inside your method and in
07:58 - here first of all we are going to
07:59 - declare one string variable and we will
08:03 - name it
08:04 - as message and we will initialize as is
08:08 - blank string okay now when somebody
08:12 - selects a radio button it has a property
08:15 - as we have seen in the last video which
08:17 - is called is selected so just take your
08:23 - rb1 and then just use the property
08:26 - called is selected okay okay so is
08:32 - selected and it Returns the Boolean
08:34 - value right so if the radio button one
08:37 - is selected which is male in our case
08:40 - what we will do we will just uh take
08:42 - this message and assign the value of
08:46 - this radio button or text of this radio
08:48 - button right so message plus equals and
08:52 - then take this
08:54 - rb1 dot get text and then you can also
09:01 - provide this uh line break okay so just
09:05 - give back slash and here which will
09:08 - provide the line break in the same way
09:11 - just copy the same code and paste it
09:14 - here and this will be rb2 this time okay
09:18 - so
09:19 - rb2 now once we have the message we will
09:22 - just display it on the label so we will
09:25 - just take this label variable and then
09:29 - Dot
09:30 - set text and then the message value so
09:34 - just provide this message value here now
09:38 - once this is done just uh take your
09:40 - method name and save everything and go
09:43 - to your fxml file select your radio
09:46 - button go to the code and in the action
09:49 - on action just choose your method name
09:53 - which is Radio select same you will do
09:55 - for the female radio button and same
09:59 - method on action will be selected here
10:02 - so both have the same on action method
10:05 - just save your code and refresh your
10:10 - project and run your project okay so I'm
10:13 - going to right click and run as Java
10:18 - application and now my app is running so
10:21 - when I click this uh mail radio button
10:24 - it prints on the label male and when I
10:27 - click female radio button it prints on
10:30 - the label female
10:32 - right so male and female right so in
10:36 - this way you can use radio buttons in
10:39 - Java FS you can use uh this same radio
10:43 - button for choosing ages or in a
10:46 - situation where you want to allow the
10:48 - user to choose only one option from
10:50 - multiple options so I hope you have
