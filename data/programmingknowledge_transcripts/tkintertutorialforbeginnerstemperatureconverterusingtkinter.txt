00:00 - hey everyone today we would create a
00:03 - simple app that converts a temperature
00:05 - in fahrenheit to celsius if I talk about
00:08 - the main things required we would need
00:10 - the function that simply converts
00:12 - Fahrenheit to Celsius that formula then
00:15 - we would need the user to input the
00:17 - temperature
00:18 - for that we would use the entry visit we
00:20 - haven't talked about it yet but it's
00:22 - very simple to use and we would also
00:25 - have a button widget which gives the
00:27 - output on being clicked okay
00:29 - so it is a very simple app let's get to
00:32 - the code right away I'll import inter
00:36 - so I'll write from thinker
00:38 - import Star
00:40 - then I'll get my window I'll write win
00:43 - equals TK
00:45 - I'll have a title I'll write when dot
00:47 - title
00:48 - let the title be
00:50 - temporary sir
00:53 - converter
00:56 - okay then I'll start adding the widgets
01:00 - first I'll add the frame on which I want
01:03 - that text box
01:06 - so I am declaring a frame for it because
01:08 - I also need to put in the label widget I
01:11 - would need the symbol of degree
01:12 - Fahrenheit so I would add that label to
01:15 - the same frame okay so I'll write
01:19 - frame
01:23 - equals frame
01:25 - and where do I want it I want it on the
01:28 - window so when
01:29 - as master and I'll pack this I'll write
01:32 - frame dot grid
01:36 - and row equals 0 and column
01:40 - equals 0 and I'll given a padding I'll
01:43 - Write Pad x equals 10. so there is no
01:47 - overlap on the screen boundaries okay
01:50 - cool
01:52 - then I'll get that entry visit that text
01:56 - box how do I do that
01:58 - I'll write temp one
02:02 - equals entry
02:05 - so that would allow the user to enter
02:08 - any text into that text box okay and for
02:12 - the arguments where do I want it I want
02:14 - this entry widget on the frame so I'll
02:17 - write frame
02:19 - and width let it be 10. cool
02:24 - then I'll use grid I'll write temp one
02:26 - dot grid
02:29 - row equals 0 and column equals zero
02:36 - same as the frame okay
02:38 - and I'll have an F variable for that
02:41 - label for that symbol of degree
02:42 - Fahrenheit because I need to tell that
02:45 - this entered
02:47 - number is in Fahrenheits and that number
02:50 - would be converted into degree celsius
02:52 - so I need to give in the units so I'll
02:54 - write f equals
02:56 - label
02:58 - and I want it on the frame so I'll write
03:00 - frame comma text and this is something
03:04 - different you might know it you might
03:06 - not know it but I can easily get degree
03:09 - Fahrenheit symbol by this so I'll write
03:11 - in capitals degree
03:13 - Fahrenheit
03:17 - and there is a slash n before this and
03:19 - it's in inverted comma School
03:22 - now I'll pack this too
03:23 - or should I say use grid
03:28 - so I'll write F dot grid and row would
03:30 - be 0 and
03:34 - column would be one okay
03:38 - simple
03:39 - now we are done with the frame now I
03:41 - would need the button that would convert
03:43 - or that would call on to the function of
03:46 - conversion okay so first let me get the
03:48 - button
03:49 - I'll write
03:52 - button
03:53 - equals button
03:57 - and window I'll not get this on the
04:00 - frame I'll just get another window okay
04:02 - and text equals
04:04 - a right Black Arrow so how can I do that
04:08 - the similar way I got that degree
04:10 - Fahrenheit symbol you can get
04:13 - numerous symbols like this so here on
04:16 - the button I'll get a right words Black
04:18 - Arrow so I'll write
04:20 - an inverted comma slash n
04:24 - and right words
04:28 - Black Arrow
04:31 - fine for the command I'll Define the
04:34 - command in some time
04:37 - first let me make the function
04:41 - and I'll give in a background color Let
04:43 - It Be sky blue
04:47 - okay that's it
04:49 - so let me Define this function
04:51 - Fahrenheit to Celsius that would be my
04:54 - function so I'll write
04:56 - Def
04:58 - Fahrenheit
05:00 - to Celsius
05:04 - and brackets
05:07 - so I'll write
05:08 - f equals temp one dot get
05:13 - so whatever you entered here in the
05:15 - entry widget you'll get it over here
05:18 - okay that would be the value of this F
05:22 - variable okay so then I'll get the C
05:25 - that stands for Celsius right now I'll
05:29 - write 5 by 9 so this is the simplest
05:31 - formula for conversion of Fahrenheit to
05:34 - Celsius
05:35 - so I'll write f
05:38 - and minus 32
05:41 - okay I'll also convert this to float
05:44 - because there is a five by nine Clause
05:47 - so I'll write float
05:54 - and now I will display the C variable as
05:57 - the text of another label widget so
05:59 - let's do that I will have temp two which
06:03 - would be the converted temperature
06:05 - the temperature entered in degree
06:08 - celsius okay so I'll write temp two
06:12 - this visit is not this variable is not
06:15 - still declared in the main function we
06:17 - will do that in some time so temp 2 in
06:21 - Brackets text
06:24 - equals f
06:27 - and inverted commas
06:30 - round
06:31 - C comma 2 to 2 places
06:35 - and curly press is closed I'll also need
06:39 - that symbol of degree Celsius here just
06:41 - like we got the degree Fahrenheit symbol
06:43 - there
06:43 - I would use that here too so I'll write
06:46 - slash n and degree Celsius
06:49 - in capital
06:56 - so now I'll get to the main function
06:58 - again I'll write up this command I'll
07:02 - write Fahrenheit
07:04 - to Celsius
07:09 - and I'll use grid
07:11 - for this button I'll write convert
07:15 - button
07:17 - dot grid
07:21 - row equals zero
07:24 - column equals
07:27 - one
07:28 - and
07:30 - pad y equals 10.
07:34 - fine
07:35 - and I need to Define The Stamp 2 also
07:38 - okay so I'll write them two it's the
07:41 - label
07:42 - initially let us keep it as degree
07:45 - celsius symbol and then it would be
07:47 - reassigned every time we click on that
07:49 - button after we enter the value okay
07:51 - so we have temp to
07:54 - equals label again and
07:57 - when
07:59 - and text Let It Be
08:02 - slash n
08:06 - degree Celsius
08:12 - fine and then I'll use grid to place it
08:15 - right temp two dot grid
08:18 - row equals 0.
08:21 - column equals to and Pad x equals 10.
08:26 - same
08:30 - so I'm done with the app I'll call in
08:32 - the main Loop I'll write win dot main
08:35 - Loop
08:37 - and run this
08:47 - so I have my screen again
08:50 - this temperature converter and let's try
08:53 - 400 degrees Fahrenheit because we know
08:55 - it's 37.78 degrees Celsius so I'll just
08:58 - write 100
09:00 - and nothing else and I'll simply click
09:02 - on this button
09:04 - so I have 37.78 degrees Celsius so this
09:07 - temperature converter is working fine
09:10 - let's enter some other value let's enter
09:13 - zero zero degree Fahrenheit is minus
09:16 - 17.78 degrees Celsius
09:19 - and this would even work for negative
09:22 - values of Fahrenheit so I'll write minus
09:24 - 11 degree Fahrenheit so it would be
09:27 - minus 23.89 degree celsius cool
09:32 - so that's it about this app
09:35 - hope you understood everything thank you
