00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - mongodb database tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in this video we will see how to use
00:07 - projection in mongodb now what is
00:10 - projection projection in mongod DB means
00:14 - selecting only necessary data rather
00:17 - than selecting whole data of a document
00:21 - and the basic skeleton of using uh you
00:24 - know this projection command is almost
00:27 - the same as finding it so so you will
00:30 - write DB then the collection name then
00:33 - find and the first argument of this find
00:36 - method will be empty curly brackets and
00:40 - the second argument will contain the key
00:44 - and the Boolean value if we want to uh
00:48 - see it or not true or false right so
00:52 - let's see how we can uh do it so the
00:55 - First Command I'm going to give here
00:56 - will be db. student.in so that we can
01:00 - see all the data so just student. find
01:04 - here and let's execute this command and
01:07 - it gives all the data we have now in
01:10 - this uh find command for example we just
01:13 - want to see the first name of every
01:16 - student and not uh all the you know data
01:20 - from all the documents so what we can do
01:23 - we can follow this format first will be
01:26 - the empty curly braak brackets and the
01:30 - second argument once again the empty
01:32 - curly brackets and the first uh here
01:36 - will be the name of your uh element
01:40 - which you want to see for example this
01:41 - one first name just give first name here
01:44 - and then colon one one means that we
01:48 - want to show this first name and zero
01:52 - means here we don't want to show first
01:55 - name okay so by default we will give one
01:59 - so that it will will show us the first
02:01 - name and let's uh execute this command
02:04 - so execute it and now it gives the first
02:07 - name but you can see here it also gives
02:11 - us the ID so in mongod DB whenever you
02:16 - want to search for a specific data it
02:19 - will always come with this ID unless you
02:24 - uh you know specifically or
02:26 - explicitly uh disable uh this uh ID so
02:30 - how to disable this once again what we
02:33 - can do here is just give the comma after
02:37 - one and then give your ID name which is
02:42 - underscore ID and then the Boolean
02:46 - attribute in this case we are giving
02:48 - zero or false so that uh it will not
02:50 - show the value of ID okay so just
02:54 - execute it and now we only see the first
02:57 - name here okay so in this way you can
03:01 - use uh projection in mongod DB I hope
