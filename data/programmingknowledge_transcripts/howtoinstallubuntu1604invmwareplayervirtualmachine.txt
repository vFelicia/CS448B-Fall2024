00:01 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:05 - install Ubuntu operating system on your
00:08 - Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating
00:10 - system using VMware
00:13 - Player so hopefully you have a VMware
00:17 - Player installed on your Windows
00:20 - operating system if you don't have I
00:22 - will uh put the link so that you can
00:25 - click and see how you can download and
00:28 - install VMware player on your Windows 8
00:32 - or Windows 8.1 operating system after
00:35 - installing VMware
00:38 - Player you will be able to see this kind
00:42 - of uh desktop icon on your desktop so
00:47 - you just need to click this vmw player
00:52 - but to install Ubuntu on your vmw player
00:56 - you also need to have open to ISO
01:00 - file so this ISO file how you can uh get
01:05 - you just need to search on your favorite
01:09 - browser
01:10 - Ubuntu and in here
01:13 - www. ubuntu.com just click it and in
01:17 - here you will be able to see uh the open
01:21 - two uh versions to download so you just
01:25 - need to go to
01:27 - download and in here open to to
01:32 - desktop and in here you will be able to
01:35 - see uh which version of over 2 are
01:39 - available uh at this time so at the time
01:44 - of making this video there are two
01:46 - versions available one is yuben 2
01:50 - 14.04 LTS which is a
01:54 - long-term uh version and other is yuntu
01:58 - 14. 10 which is uh which will be only
02:03 - valid for 9 months and then they will
02:06 - release a new version of open 2 so
02:10 - generally I will recommend this LTS
02:13 - version this LTS version will be valid
02:16 - for almost 5
02:19 - years so uh just first of all you must
02:26 - know what type of windows operating
02:30 - system you have most probably if you
02:33 - have a relatively new computer you must
02:36 - have 64bit operating system but it may
02:41 - uh uh have uh you know 32 B bit
02:44 - operating system so to check uh on
02:47 - Windows 8.1 you just need to go to
02:50 - system search for uh
02:54 - system and click it and in here you will
02:58 - be able to find in system type what uh
03:02 - system you have I have 64-bit operating
03:04 - system so I will uh choose 64bit
03:07 - operating system and click
03:09 - download and in
03:11 - here uh if you want to donate to your
03:14 - buntu uh you can donate otherwise uh you
03:20 - to is open source and free so you may
03:24 - not wish to donate if you want and you
03:27 - can just drag every

03:52 - 14.04.1 minus desktop minus
03:56 - amd64 do ISO file so this will be ISO
04:00 - file and it will take some time to
04:03 - download maybe uh 10 minutes or 20
04:06 - minutes because it's about 981 MB file
04:11 - so just download this file Ive already
04:13 - downloaded this ISO file open to
04:17 - 14. 4 ISO file so once you download uh
04:23 - this file you are ready to install
04:25 - Ubuntu on your VMware Player so just
04:29 - open your VMware Player and uh just
04:33 - click this uh uh option here create a
04:36 - new virtual machine and in here you can
04:40 - choose uh which option you want so you

05:11 - system later okay click next now you
05:15 - need to choose which uh type of
05:18 - operating system uh you want to install
05:21 - so just uh choose Linux because open 2
05:25 - is a Linux operating system and we are
05:28 - going to install open to 64 so just
05:31 - choose UB to 64 bit okay click next and
05:38 - in here you can give the name to your uh
05:41 - open to operating system I will leave it

05:51 - default click
05:53 - next in here you can uh give the I mean
05:59 - the maximum disk size to your operating
06:02 - system so uh 20 GB is enough for uh
06:08 - 64bit UB to operating system but if you
06:12 - want to uh increase it you can increase
06:14 - it from here for now I will just
06:17 - allocate 20 GB for me it's okay and then

06:49 - virtual
06:50 - machine uh you can change its setting by
06:53 - going to edit virtual machine settings
06:56 - and in here you can change uh the
06:58 - settings for for example uh by default
07:02 - it allocates only one processor uh to
07:05 - your virtual machine but you can choose
07:08 - uh more processors for example I will
07:10 - choose four for now
07:13 - and in here hard disk uh you will be
07:18 - able to see the hard disk current size
07:21 - and
07:22 - system maximum size 20 GB so it's okay
07:27 - for me and then

08:49 - to choose uh shared
08:52 - folder and uh virtual VMware tools uh
08:58 - which are the tools which are required
09:01 - by your guest operating system but uh

11:40 - the first option which is the default
11:43 - option erase disk and install open to
11:46 - don't worry it will not erase your uh uh
11:49 - host operating system it's just a
11:51 - virtual machine so you can uh safely
11:55 - select erase dis and install obuntu it
11:57 - will not erase your original operating
12:00 - system so just cck install
12:09 - now and the location you need to choose
12:14 - if you need to change you can change it
12:17 - but it's okay for me so I will click
12:22 - continue and here you can choose your
12:25 - keyboard layout so for example uh by
12:29 - default it's English but if you have a
12:32 - keyboard layout uh to some particular
12:36 - country or language you can choose it
12:39 - from here for example my keyboard layout
12:41 - is German so I will just search for
12:45 - German layout which is keyboard
12:49 - layout so I will just search for German
12:53 - which is here and in German also there
12:57 - are many option but I will choose the
12:59 - first option General option and in here
13:03 - you can uh you know print your key keys
13:09 - so that you can check whether it's
13:10 - working or not and click
13:16 - continue and now you just need to give
13:20 - the name to your open two opening system
13:24 - which is your name for example
13:31 - programming
13:33 - knowledge and then you need to pick the
13:37 - password for your buntu operating system
13:40 - so you just need to uh know remember
13:43 - this password in order to log in once
13:46 - again so just choose a password which is
13:50 - most appropriate for
13:54 - you and then uh require my password
13:59 - leave it as default click
14:03 - continue and now uh the installation has
14:07 - been started so it will take some time
14:11 - to install Ubuntu by the meantime you
14:14 - can also click this install VMware tool
14:17 - which will en enable some features on
14:21 - your system so click yes and click
14:27 - okay and I will let this process to go
14:31 - on and once some important step occurs I
14:36 - will uh restart the
14:41 - videos so now it's installing uh system
14:45 - files and after this it's almost
14:50 - complete so I will wait for this process
14:54 - to complete
14:56 - also so now our installation is is
14:59 - complete and uh this Ubuntu is telling
15:03 - us to restart uh this virtual machine so
15:07 - I will just click this
15:09 - restart and for the first time when you
15:12 - install uh2 on uh VMware or any uh other
15:17 - virtual machine it may uh take some time
15:23 - to
15:24 - restart so if it doesn't restart you
15:27 - just need to power of your virtual
15:31 - machine and then start your open to once
15:35 - again so for example in this case let's
15:40 - uh wait for 3 or 4 seconds otherwise we
15:45 - will restart or start obuntu by ourself
15:49 - but Ubuntu is restarted by itself so we
15:53 - don't need to do anything right now
15:59 - and open 2 is ready to use so you just
16:02 - need to give your
16:06 - password
16:08 - and enter your password and now we are
16:13 - almost ready to use open
16:17 - 2 so in some moment hopefully we will
16:21 - see the sidebar
16:26 - Here and Now sidebar is is here so we
16:30 - can use this sidebar I will click this
16:34 - maximize button but nothing happens so
16:38 - what I will try is I'll try this option
16:43 - enter full screen
16:44 - mode and still it
16:47 - doesn't
16:49 - uh go in full screen mode so I will
16:53 - change to this option
16:59 - so to solve this problem of uh this
17:03 - screen resolution what you can do is you
17:07 - can go to your system so just go to
17:11 - system settings so go to this small
17:14 - button and go to system
17:18 - settings and in system settings you need
17:21 - to go to display a settings so just
17:24 - click this display settings here
17:27 - display and in display by default uh
17:30 - when you install auntu on uh virtual
17:34 - machine its uh resolution is
17:38 - 800 cross 600 but uh the actual
17:43 - resolution for our machine we uh need is
17:49 - 1360 cross
17:53 - 768 or uh for better resolution you can
17:58 - choose uh the upper options also but for
18:01 - now I will choose this option 63 uh
18:05 - 1360 cross
18:08 - 768 and then I will click okay or apply
18:13 - from
18:14 - here and now it opens this in better
18:19 - resolution but this also for my uh
18:23 - system or my screen it's a little bit
18:26 - lesser so I will increase it once again
18:30 - to 1 1920 because my computer resolution
18:34 - is this one 1 1920 cross
18:38 - 1440 okay so you need to set the
18:41 - resolution according to your uh screen
18:44 - computer screen and so I will choose it
18:48 - once
18:49 - again and
18:52 - apply so now
18:55 - the uh configuration is uh totally fine
18:59 - for me so I will just say keep this
19:04 - configuration and apply keep this
19:07 - configuration and just close it so now
19:12 - this
19:13 - uh has increased your resolution also
19:17 - and now you can uh start using ubu on
19:21 - your virtual machine as a normal
19:24 - operating system so I can open Terminal
19:27 - it will open it and you can use it uh
19:31 - however you want so I hope you have
19:34 - enjoyed this video please R comment and
19:36 - subscribe and bye for now
