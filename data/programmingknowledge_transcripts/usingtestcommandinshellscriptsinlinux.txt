00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:02 - we will be learning about a test command
00:03 - Okay so before starting let me first
00:06 - create the file that is 18
00:09 - tester command you can write dot sh okay
00:13 - so let me just add the
00:16 - aspang okay bin bash yeah
00:19 - so before starting this particular
00:21 - tutorial let me first tell you about the
00:23 - basic like description about the test
00:25 - command so basically test command is
00:26 - basically uh
00:29 - used to test the
00:32 - particular expression press the
00:35 - particular
00:36 - expression or particular condition okay
00:41 - so if condition is true then
00:46 - it will
00:48 - return zero
00:51 - otherwise
00:53 - return one okay so if condition is true
00:57 - it will return 0 or otherwise it will
01:00 - return
01:01 - one okay so it's basically uh like one
01:04 - of the another method of writing this
01:06 - expression like whatever we write in
01:08 - this if condition whatever the
01:10 - expression we write here whether of 5 is
01:13 - equal equal to 5 okay so it just we can
01:19 - just replace these part using the test
01:21 - command okay
01:22 - so but also there are many uh like many
01:26 - functionalities or many options are
01:28 - being used with the test command like if
01:30 - you want to check whether two strings
01:32 - are equal whether there is some file uh
01:35 - it just don't know what whether the file
01:37 - is empty or not whether the file or
01:39 - directory like if we want to check
01:42 - whether some particular directory it is
01:45 - directory or not or some mathematical
01:48 - operations are equal to greater greater
01:51 - greater than all those things okay
01:54 - so we can do all those operations so
01:56 - let's start so first we will start with
01:59 - the string comparison like whether two
02:02 - strings are equal or not or not equal to
02:04 - whether a string is empty or not all
02:06 - those things we will do
02:08 - so how we can do it let me just uh
02:10 - create the two variables that is a and b
02:15 - so I'll write my name ayush and be equal
02:18 - to ayush
02:20 - in this
02:23 - okay double quotes and now I will write
02:26 - the if condition and I will use the test
02:28 - command if test so it is basically like
02:32 - uh what we can say advice to use the
02:35 - double quote for the variable while
02:37 - using the test command okay if dollar
02:40 - one equal to
02:42 - dollar B
02:44 - then what we have to do then we will
02:46 - just Echo a is
02:50 - equal to p
02:52 - okay and I will just uh write the else
02:57 - all part also else equal a is
03:01 - not equal to P okay just close the
03:06 - if condition and clear the screen
03:11 - and CH mode plus x 18
03:15 - dot slash 18 okay so here you can see a
03:19 - is equal to B now what I do if I just
03:21 - change the uh
03:23 - B okay
03:26 - so here you can see a is not equal to V
03:29 - equal or not equal it's equal
03:32 - okay
03:34 - let me just clear the screen again and
03:36 - run the script yeah so here you can see
03:38 - a is not equal to B okay also uh test
03:42 - command uh offers many more
03:44 - functionalities like string size if you
03:47 - want to get okay so how we can do it
03:50 - using hyphen and option okay
03:53 - like you
03:55 - not basically strings I just basically
03:57 - checks whether string is uh what we can
04:00 - say
04:01 - empty or not okay so how we will do it
04:05 - using test
04:07 - hyphen n dollar
04:09 - [Music]
04:11 - a we will use so basically if
04:14 - there is some string then it will uh
04:17 - Echo
04:20 - string is
04:27 - not empty
04:29 - okay
04:31 - e m p t y okay
04:34 - so hyphen and option is checks whether
04:37 - there is a string or not if a string is
04:40 - not empty then it will result true it
04:44 - will return it returned true if it is
04:47 - not empty otherwise it will return
04:50 - for that it means the string is empty
04:52 - simple
04:54 - so how you can do it string is empty
04:59 - so we are checking a for a so for a
05:02 - there is a string so it will it should
05:03 - return string is not empty
05:06 - so string is not emptied is returned if
05:08 - I will just pass hyphen B uh dollar B
05:10 - here so it will it should return a
05:12 - string is empty
05:14 - okay so it is returning my string is not
05:16 - empty what is it running yeah uh let me
05:19 - just again run the script
05:22 - okay it is also returning a string is
05:24 - not empty
05:26 - so for this we we use hyphen Z option
05:29 - sorry for that we will use iPhone Z
05:31 - option here
05:33 - so clear the screen okay so again it is
05:36 - just showing me same thing okay but uh
05:41 - okay okay sorry I'm sorry here we have
05:44 - to use this
05:46 - double quotes
05:49 - okay but still it is showing string is
05:52 - not empty but why it is empty
05:56 - there is something wrong we have done
05:59 - here
06:00 - [Music]
06:01 - um
06:03 - yeah yeah sorry sorry what we have to do
06:06 - here is string this is empty string so
06:11 - this condition is getting true and it is
06:13 - just displaying me this Eco message so
06:16 - that's a wrong if I do something else
06:18 - here
06:21 - condition will get false and then it
06:24 - will display me this okay so so there is
06:26 - nothing much so we have to just replace
06:29 - this eco
06:32 - with above one
06:35 - string is empty or here we can just do
06:39 - string is not empty okay so now it
06:42 - should return a string is not empty so
06:45 - here you can see string is not empty if
06:47 - I will just remove this part it will
06:49 - display me a string is empty
06:52 - okay so it was just if it is true then
06:55 - it will execute obviously okay
06:58 - so in this way you can do a string
07:00 - comparisons also
07:02 - so now moving forward uh in numerical
07:05 - part what you can do if we want
07:07 - comparison like equal to greater than
07:10 - all those things so how we can do it
07:11 - let's just do it okay so I will just
07:15 - copy this much part
07:17 - and again I will paste it here and I
07:20 - will provide here some numbers like a
07:22 - equal to 10 and be equal to 20. and here
07:26 - if test hyphen will not provide hyphen
07:28 - here we will use uh
07:32 - the same thing which we use for
07:33 - numerical like hyphen EQ so here I will
07:36 - use dollar a
07:39 - okay if dollar a equal to
07:45 - dollar B okay I'll remove this one
07:50 - so here if a equal to B so it may here
07:53 - we will print a is
07:56 - equal to B if it is true otherwise
08:00 - here we will just print not equal
08:03 - okay just again clear the screen and run
08:06 - the command so string is empty and not
08:09 - equal okay so if I will do 10 here also
08:12 - so in this case
08:16 - a is equal to b or you can check other
08:20 - options like less than LT for less than
08:23 - here I will just uh
08:26 - and one more zero that is 100 and clear
08:29 - the screen run the script
08:32 - okay so here we will just change the
08:36 - equal statement like a is greater than b
08:41 - sorry less than
08:44 - less than b
08:47 - okay
08:48 - so clear the screen again run the script
08:51 - so a is less than B that means it means
08:53 - uh
08:58 - it means this statement is true and this
09:01 - one is executing and if I write to here
09:05 - so here we will see not less than b
09:08 - so not less than b so in this case you
09:11 - can use multiple things using test
09:14 - command like you can play with the
09:16 - numerical part string also okay so
09:19 - instead of this double bracket whatever
09:21 - we use in this one like double bracket
09:23 - in spaces so we it is easy to use this
09:26 - one okay so now moving forward we will
09:29 - uh use some like file comparisons also
09:32 - so how we can do it okay so I will
09:35 - provide the file name not file name
09:38 - um I will use these much of file or
09:40 - hello.txt to play with it so there are
09:43 - multiple options which we can see like
09:46 - uh hyphen s option which is used for
09:49 - checking the uh
09:51 - like what we can say checking the if
09:54 - file is empty or not okay
09:57 - so let's start with this so
10:02 - here I will just add the command that is
10:05 - the file comparisons okay
10:08 - so here what we can do if
10:12 - test hyphen s and I will provide the
10:15 - file name my file name is hello.txt
10:18 - then a file is empty hyphen is used to
10:21 - check if file is empty or not we will
10:23 - just Eco file is empty
10:31 - otherwise else
10:33 - Eco file is not empty it means if
10:37 - condition is true then it will execute
10:40 - line number 32 and if not it will
10:43 - execute line number 34.
10:45 - okay so I will just comment out all
10:49 - other way leave it let's check
10:52 - so let me first check the hello.txt so
10:54 - in hello.txt there is nothing
10:57 - so it should return file is empty so
11:03 - we have got some kind of error so the
11:07 - error is we have not closed the if
11:09 - condition clear the screen
11:12 - so file is not empty it is showing why
11:15 - because uh
11:18 - I don't know
11:20 - the file is empty or not so the file is
11:23 - empty it should display let me just
11:24 - create one more file
11:27 - test1.txt so it is absolutely empty file
11:31 - so again here I will provide
11:35 - test1 Dot txt
11:39 - clear the screen
11:42 - so again it displaying me file is not
11:44 - empty why so
11:47 - okay
11:49 - um
11:49 - [Music]
11:54 - okay if file is not empty it will
11:57 - display
12:00 - this line okay if file is empty then it
12:04 - will display this line
12:07 - okay okay okay so we have done some
12:10 - mistakes here like we we have to just
12:13 - replace this line here
12:15 - so I don't know why this thing is
12:17 - happening I'm so sorry for that
12:19 - so just to clear the screen and yeah
12:23 - file is empty now so now what we will do
12:26 - we will just write some text here and
12:28 - now it should display some like file is
12:30 - not empty here
12:32 - so clear the screen and again so here
12:35 - you can see now it's showing file is not
12:37 - empty okay
12:41 - so uh also there are many flags we can
12:44 - use hyphen D and all those things okay
12:46 - so there are many flags which we can use
12:48 - to check if iPhone D is used for check I
12:52 - think whether the uh whatever you are
12:55 - passing that is it is directory or not
12:57 - okay
13:00 - so I will create one directory that is
13:02 - uh uh let's create one directory that is
13:06 - the ir1 okay so here I will just pass
13:09 - dr1
13:12 - if it is directory it is I will display
13:16 - if condition is get true
13:19 - it's a directory or
13:24 - it is not a directory I will display
13:26 - here
13:28 - it is not our directory
13:31 - just run the script
13:35 - okay so it is a directory and I will
13:37 - provide some different name here like
13:39 - suppose I provide hello
13:41 - uh what was the file name that is
13:44 - test1.txt
13:46 - and now it should display
13:49 - it is not a directly so yeah it's
13:50 - correct okay
13:52 - so uh I hope you liked it guys we can
13:54 - use test command while providing the
13:56 - conditions in if with if conditions so
13:59 - okay so that's all for today is I know
14:02 - there were some mistakes today so sorry
14:04 - for that and I will meet you in the next
14:06 - video okay so thank you for watching
