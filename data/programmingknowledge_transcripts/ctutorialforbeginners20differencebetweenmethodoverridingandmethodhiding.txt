00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - teach you about difference between
00:06 - method hiding which we have seen in the
00:09 - last to last video and method overriding
00:12 - which we have seen in the last video
00:14 - when we have learned
00:16 - polymorphism so suppose I have a base
00:19 - class called
00:20 - Drawing so it's just a a simple base
00:24 - class which is like this public class uh
00:28 - drawing and it has one method called
00:31 - Draw and what what this method is doing
00:35 - it's it's printing just a message and
00:38 - this message says this is just a generic
00:42 - drawing
00:43 - class for example okay now I want to
00:48 - derive a child class from this Base
00:51 - Class so what I will do is I will just
00:56 - derived a child class called line for
00:59 - example
01:02 - and I will derive from this Base Class
01:07 - drawing and this also has uh this draw
01:11 - method and this time I will say the
01:15 - message that this is
01:18 - a line okay so this we have seen in the
01:23 - last video when we want to
01:25 - override uh
01:28 - this base class draw method from a
01:32 - derived class method we add a
01:36 - keyword virtual in the base class
01:41 - and override in the derived class so
01:45 - what this will do is this virtual
01:48 - keyword says the base class that
01:52 - whenever we are going to uh declare uh
01:56 - derived class and we want to have its
01:59 - own uh draw method we can
02:01 - override this same
02:04 - method by using this virtual and using
02:07 - this override
02:09 - keyword and now let's go to uh the main
02:15 - method and let's call and let's create
02:18 - the instance of this drawing class so I
02:20 - will just copy this drawing class and I
02:24 - will just create the instant
02:28 - obj is equal to
02:31 - new and let's
02:33 - create the instance of this line
02:38 - class so line
02:45 - okay so what this is going to do is
02:49 - let's call the draw method from here obj
02:54 - do draw okay so what this will do is
03:00 - let's try and run the program and what's
03:03 - it going to do is it will print this is
03:06 - a line because we have
03:09 - overridden our Base Class method draw by
03:13 - our derived class method right so it
03:17 - will whenever
03:19 - you declare a base class reference which
03:23 - points to the derived class uh object
03:28 - then it will call the derive class
03:31 - method okay now let's uh try to change
03:36 - or make it method hiding so instead of
03:40 - this
03:41 - override keyword we will write new so
03:45 - this we have seen in the last to last
03:47 - video that whenever we use this new
03:50 - keyword with our derived class your
03:55 - drive class method
03:57 - will hide your Base Class method right
04:03 - but whenever we run the
04:06 - program you see the message is this is
04:09 - just a generic drawing
04:12 - class so whenever you use this method
04:16 - hiding using this new
04:19 - keyword and you will declare the
04:22 - reference variable pointing to the
04:25 - derived class it will in it will
04:28 - indicate to The Base Class okay and
04:31 - whenever you use method overriding using
04:35 - override keyword it'll override your
04:38 - base class method and it will point to
04:42 - this method derived class method so this
04:46 - is the difference between overriding and
04:48 - Method hiding method hiding always point
04:52 - to the base class if you have a base
04:55 - class object right and Method overriding
04:58 - always
05:00 - fetch you the overridden method which is
05:06 - this is a line so I hope you have
05:08 - understood the basic difference between
05:10 - method hiding and Method
05:13 - overriding and I hope you have enjoyed
05:15 - this video please wrate comment and
05:16 - subscribe and bye for now
