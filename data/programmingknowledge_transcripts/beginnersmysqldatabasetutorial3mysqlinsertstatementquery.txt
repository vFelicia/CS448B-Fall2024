00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how to create a
00:07 - new schema a new
00:09 - database using MySQL workbench and also
00:14 - with the help of query and we have also
00:17 - learned how to create a
00:20 - table inside your database in this video
00:25 - we will see how to insert values in your
00:30 - database table and some other
00:33 - things so let's get
00:37 - started first of
00:39 - all we made this database called
00:42 - database only so go here and click this
00:48 - and in this
00:50 - table the table name is e data I have
00:53 - changed the table
00:54 - name and just click right click this
00:59 - table and go to edit data so we will
01:03 - come up with our table with four columns
01:07 - we have created last time the First
01:10 - Column is employee ID second is name
01:13 - third is surname and fourth is
01:16 - age now we are going to insert some
01:19 - values
01:21 - in this table so just double click these
01:29 - cells
01:30 - and you can insert the column
01:34 - so
01:43 - Mark and his age
01:47 - 25
01:53 - second
01:57 - John his age
02:03 - 33
02:09 - third
02:15 - check his age is 40 for
02:19 - example and the fourth
02:21 - employee
02:25 - Jill and his age is 45
02:30 - so simply you can insert these values in
02:34 - your
02:35 - database and when you click when you're
02:39 - done with inserting click
02:42 - apply and in here comes the query insert
02:48 - into database
02:50 - dot e data which is our tail table name
02:56 - and then write your column in which you
02:58 - want to insert data and then the
03:02 - values
03:06 - so and then
03:08 - apply and our data is inserted
03:14 - successfully so if you go and right
03:18 - click and go to edit table once again
03:21 - our data is saved you can
03:25 - see
03:28 - now I want want to insert this data with
03:31 - the help of query so what I will do is I
03:35 - will select my second database which I
03:37 - use for inserting data with the help of
03:44 - queries so I will select
03:48 - this
03:49 - and in my query tab here I will
03:56 - write insert
04:07 - insert into your table name which is e
04:18 - data and
04:22 - then it's a better good practice
04:26 - to indicate your schema also so I will
04:31 - write database dot e data so it
04:36 - indicates that sorry 1 2 3 it indicates
04:41 - my database which is this database
04:44 - database 1 2 3 dot this table
04:49 - so it specifies my database and my table
04:55 - and then I will make
04:57 - brackets and
05:00 - The Columns in which I want to make
05:03 - changes so First Column
05:07 - is
05:12 - ID employee info comma SE second column
05:17 - is name third column
05:21 - is so name sorry
05:31 - so
05:33 - name
05:37 - and fourth column is
05:43 - age
05:45 - okay and
05:47 - then
05:50 - write
05:54 - values and once again make a bracket and
05:58 - close it and in here
06:00 - we will insert the values so first the
06:03 - employee ID or this ID so this is an
06:07 - integer I will write one comma name mark
06:12 - for example third column is surname I
06:15 - will write some
06:20 - surname and fourth column is AG so I
06:22 - will write 34 is his
06:26 - age so this is the
06:30 - in order to insert a first row in
06:34 - your
06:36 - database one to three and in the
06:40 - table e
06:42 - data this which is this and I will click
06:47 - this execute
06:49 - button and it
06:55 - says some
06:57 - error unknown column
07:01 - Mark so we will see why it's
07:09 - not so let's see what is the mistake
07:13 - here here I have written insert into
07:16 - database name dot my table name and in
07:21 - this bracket my column
07:23 - names and I have written values three
07:27 - and Mark and Bill
07:30 - these are
07:33 - characters
07:35 - so if you want to insert the character
07:38 - it cannot identify that it's a character
07:42 - so you have to surrounded by single
07:48 - quotes like
07:51 - this and now it identify that it's a
07:55 - Vare
07:58 - variable so now now when
08:01 - I execute my
08:08 - query it shows me duplicate entry
08:13 - because I will write four here because I
08:16 - have inserted already three values
08:19 - previously for testing my query so once
08:24 - again and yes it's
08:27 - saved you can see see
08:30 - here my green indication comes so it
08:34 - means that my query is
08:37 - executed so let's
08:40 - see my data is inserted or not
08:44 - yes this is the fourth column I have
08:48 - inserted and the error which comes
08:52 - previously is the duplicate entry for
08:55 - primary key because I have already
08:58 - inserted one 2 three so I have to insert
09:01 - fourth
09:04 - time so in this way you can insert data
09:08 - into table with the help of workbench
09:11 - also and with the help of this query
09:13 - also once again we will go to the query
09:16 - to insert a data into the table you need
09:20 - to write insert into database do table
09:24 - name your columns in which you want to
09:28 - enter your data and the values you want
09:32 - to enter and remember that if you want
09:37 - to insert Vare
09:40 - variable you need single codes
09:44 - surrounding that value or
09:48 - that data so keep in mind this and you
09:53 - will be good to go so I hope you have
09:56 - learned something new this time please
09:58 - write commented sub subscribe and bye
10:00 - for now
