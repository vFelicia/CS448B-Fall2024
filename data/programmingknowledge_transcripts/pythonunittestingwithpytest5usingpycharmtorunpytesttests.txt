00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python unit testing tutorial for
00:04 - beginners using PI test now in this
00:06 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:09 - run your tests which you have written
00:11 - using PI test
00:13 - inside your PyCharm ide so till now we
00:18 - have been running our tests which we
00:21 - have written using pi test on the
00:23 - command prompt or the terminal but using
00:27 - pycharm ide also we can run these tests
00:30 - inside the PyCharm ide so let's see how
00:34 - we can run those tests which we have
00:37 - written using pi test using the PI charm
00:41 - ide so as you can see here on the left
00:44 - hand side i have a class and on the
00:47 - right hand side i have written some
00:50 - tests which are related to this class
00:53 - now i want to run these tests which i
00:57 - have written here using the pi test
01:01 - inside the pycharm ide so for doing this
01:04 - what I need to do is first of all I need
01:07 - to install PI test package inside the
01:11 - pycharm
01:12 - ide so you can see here when I try to
01:15 - import PI test inside the pycharm ide
01:18 - first of all it will give me this red
01:21 - squiggly line which means that PI charm
01:24 - is not recognizing this pi test package
01:28 - till now so let's first of all install
01:31 - this package so just click on file and
01:34 - then click on settings and then go to
01:37 - the section which says project and then
01:40 - your project names so project colon
01:43 - project name so I'm going to click on
01:45 - this and then go to the project
01:48 - interpreter now as you can see here
01:50 - there are some packages which are
01:52 - already here and we want to install a
01:55 - new package which is PI test so I'm
01:58 - going to click on this install or this
02:01 - plus icon here and then I will just
02:04 - search for PI test and the first option
02:08 - you will see here is PI test and you can
02:11 - see this will be the version which will
02:13 - be installed
02:14 - on our PyCharm IDE so what I'm going to
02:17 - do is I'm going to just click on this
02:19 - button let me just move it a little bit
02:22 - above so you can see this button so I'm
02:24 - going to click on this install package
02:26 - button which is going to install PI test
02:29 - package
02:30 - inside my PyCharm ide and once this pi
02:33 - test package is installed you will see
02:36 - this message which says package pi test
02:38 - installed successfully with the green
02:41 - highlighted text that means PI test is
02:45 - installed so you can close this window
02:47 - so I'm going to close this window and
02:49 - you will be able to see this pi test now
02:52 - is added to your project interpreter so
02:56 - now when I click on ok and I will wait
03:00 - for some time
03:01 - till this process has been finished and
03:04 - then after some time you will see this
03:07 - red squiggly line under this pi test is
03:10 - gone so now our pycharm ide recognizes
03:14 - this pi test package and now we want to
03:17 - tell the pi CIAM ide that we want to run
03:20 - the PI tests so for doing that
03:23 - once again I will click on file and then
03:25 - go to the settings and then this time I
03:29 - will go to that tools so just click on
03:31 - Tools option and when you scroll down
03:34 - you will be able to see this option
03:36 - which says python integrated tools so
03:40 - just click on this and on the right hand
03:43 - side you will be able to see under
03:45 - testing that default test runner by
03:48 - default is unit tests so we need to
03:50 - change this to PI test ok so just change
03:54 - this default test Runner to PI test and
03:58 - then apply and then click OK which is
04:02 - going to tell pycharm IDE that we want
04:05 - to run the PI tests now as soon as you
04:09 - are finished with the setting of PI test
04:11 - on your pycharm IDE what you can do now
04:15 - is you can right click on the file where
04:19 - you want to run PI tests so this is my
04:22 - test underscore math underscore func dot
04:25 - py file where all my
04:27 - tests are there so just right click on
04:30 - this file and then you will be able to
04:32 - see this option which says run PI test
04:34 - in the file you want to run the PI test
04:38 - so just click on this option which says
04:40 - run PI test in the file and as soon as
04:43 - you do this you will be able to see this
04:46 - window which is for the PI test and you
04:50 - will be able to see all the tests which
04:52 - have been passed on the left-hand side
04:56 - and the terminal output on the
04:59 - right-hand side so let me just maximize
05:01 - this window here and on the right hand
05:05 - side you will be able to see the output
05:07 - so we have run the test on this file and
05:11 - because I have some output which is a
05:14 - print output as you can see here print
05:17 - statement here which is responsible for
05:20 - printing this line and also I have this
05:23 - print statement for teardown
05:25 - so this teardown is printed using this
05:29 - print statement also you will be able to
05:32 - see two dots here which means we have a
05:34 - two tests inside this file which ran
05:38 - successfully so let's add this verbose
05:41 - flag inside our PI tests using pycharm
05:46 - ide so once you ran your PI test using
05:50 - PyCharm ide you will be able to see this
05:53 - drop down menu here it says PI test in
05:56 - whatever file you are running your PI
05:59 - test on and just click on this file you
06:03 - will be able to see this added
06:04 - configuration option right away after
06:07 - first run of your test so just click on
06:11 - this option which says added
06:13 - configuration and then you can add the
06:17 - arguments which are additional arguments
06:20 - like verbose or - s or whatever option
06:24 - you want to provide here using this
06:26 - additional arguments option so let's say
06:29 - I want to provide this - V option which
06:33 - is for verbose and then I will say apply
06:35 - and then I will say ok and then I'm
06:38 - going to run that test
06:40 - once again either clicking on this
06:43 - button or right away from this button so
06:46 - let me click on this button and once you
06:49 - ran your test you will be able to see
06:51 - the verbose output on the right hand
06:54 - side let me just remove these print
06:57 - statements because they are just not
07:00 - looking good on the tests so I'm going
07:03 - to just remove the setup and teardown
07:06 - pretty print statements from here and
07:08 - I'm going to run the tests once again
07:11 - and then you will be able to see the
07:14 - correct verbose output here now if you
07:16 - want to see all these tests which are
07:19 - passed or failed on the left-hand side
07:21 - using these green or red circles then
07:25 - you can click on this green circle at
07:28 - the top here so once click on this green
07:30 - circle and you will be able to see the
07:33 - list of all tests which are there inside
07:36 - your file so this is the script name
07:39 - which is test underscore math underscore
07:41 - func and these are the two tests which
07:45 - are there inside this test script so you
07:48 - can see the first test is test core data
07:51 - which is this one and the second test is
07:54 - test mark data which is the second test
07:57 - here you can also run these tests
08:00 - individually so you can right click and
08:02 - then you can just say run test which is
08:05 - going to run only one test which you
08:07 - want to run so once you ran this only
08:10 - one test you will be able to see on the
08:13 - top that only this tests has been
08:16 - running so in order to run the whole
08:19 - Python script for the test you can once
08:23 - again select this option which is PI
08:26 - test in whatever test script you have so
08:29 - we'll just choose that and then run it
08:31 - once again it will run your all the
08:34 - tests once again and you will be able to
08:36 - see all the tests here so in order to
08:39 - run individual tests you can just right
08:42 - click and then run those tests but
08:44 - remember that you need to change this
08:46 - option again from here also if you want
08:49 - to run the test by just hovering over
08:52 - the test so this is the test
08:53 - let's say I want to run only this test
08:55 - so you can just hover over this test and
08:58 - then right click and then just click on
09:01 - this option run by test for this test
09:05 - which is going to run only that test
09:08 - once again I'm going to select this
09:09 - option for the whole file which is going
09:12 - to run all the tests once again for the
09:16 - PI test using PyCharm ide so this is how
09:19 - you can run your tests which you have
09:21 - written using pi tests using PyCharm ide
09:25 - I hope you've enjoyed this video and I
09:28 - will see you in the next video
09:37 - you
