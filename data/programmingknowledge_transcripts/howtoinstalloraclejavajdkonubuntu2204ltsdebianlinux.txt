00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install and
00:04 - set up Java on your Ubuntu operating
00:06 - system
00:07 - so let's get started and let's see how
00:09 - we can do it
00:10 - so first of all open your favorite
00:12 - browser and search for install Java and
00:15 - the first link which will appear here
00:16 - will be from
00:18 - oracle.com forward slash Java so we are
00:22 - going to install the Oracle Java on our
00:26 - Ubuntu operating system so click this
00:29 - Oracle Java link and then when you
00:33 - scroll down here first of all you will
00:36 - see the latest version of java which is
00:40 - available so at the time of making this
00:43 - video jdk 20 and jdk 17 versions are
00:47 - available we are going to download the
00:50 - jdk 20 version
00:52 - so just select the latest version and
00:55 - then scroll down
00:56 - for Ubuntu we are going to download the
01:00 - dot Deb file which is for the Debian
01:03 - packages so we are going to just click
01:05 - on this dot Deb file so I just click on
01:10 - this which is going to start the
01:12 - download of this jdk20 Dot daeb and once
01:17 - this file is downloaded let's go to the
01:21 - downloads folder and see this file so to
01:25 - install this dot the EB file you can
01:28 - open the command prompt so just press
01:30 - Ctrl alt t on your Ubuntu operating
01:32 - system which is going to open this
01:34 - command prompt or you can go to the
01:36 - applications and then click on this
01:37 - terminal option which is also going to
01:40 - open the command prompt
01:42 - so we are going to navigate to our
01:45 - downloads folder and I'm going to do LS
01:49 - and here I can see this
01:52 - jdk20.deb file right in order to install
01:56 - Java using this dot the EB file you need
02:00 - to give this command sudo tpkg
02:04 - hyphen I and the name of the jdk file so
02:08 - just write jdk here and then press tab
02:12 - which is going to auto complete your
02:15 - file name and then press enter and then
02:18 - give your ubuntu's password which is
02:21 - used to log into your Ubuntu operating
02:23 - system and then press enter
02:25 - you can see the installation of this
02:29 - Java jdk has been started so just wait
02:32 - for this command to complete now when
02:35 - you execute this command you may see
02:39 - this kind of error and this is a very
02:41 - common error if you haven't installed
02:45 - these two libraries on your Ubuntu
02:48 - operating system the installation of
02:51 - java will complain about
02:53 - these dependencies right so the fix is
02:57 - fairly easy you just need to write this
03:00 - command before executing the dot the EB
03:04 - Command right so just write sudo apt
03:09 - install and then we are going to give
03:11 - hyphen y so that it will not ask us
03:16 - to provide some permission again and
03:18 - again right and then whatever
03:21 - dependencies you see here I can see two
03:25 - of them right now which is lib C6 hyphen
03:29 - I
03:30 - 386 and lib C6 hyphen X 32. give both
03:36 - the names here so just copy the name and
03:41 - paste it here and then give space and
03:44 - then once again copy the name and then
03:47 - paste it here okay so sudo apt install
03:50 - hyphen Y and then the name of both the
03:54 - dependencies and then press enter
03:57 - which is going to install these
03:59 - dependencies
04:01 - so once these dependencies will be
04:04 - installed
04:05 - the previous command will
04:07 - work without any problem so you can see
04:10 - these libraries are now installed so
04:13 - let's once again execute our DOT Deb
04:17 - file for jdk which we have downloaded
04:20 - right earlier it was so showing the
04:22 - error because we had some unmet
04:26 - dependencies for jdk 20. so once again
04:31 - let me just execute this command and
04:34 - hopefully this time it's going to work
04:36 - so now you can see uh everything has
04:39 - worked perfectly after we have installed
04:43 - these libraries and and then executed
04:46 - this dpkg hyphen I uh
04:49 - jdk.deb Command right so once that's
04:53 - done
04:54 - you can clear your terminal by writing
04:57 - clear command now once Java is installed
05:00 - on your Ubuntu operating system you need
05:03 - to do two settings and I'm going to uh
05:07 - show you how to do those two settings
05:09 - before you can start uh using Java
05:13 - command and those two uh settings or
05:15 - those two commands are these two
05:18 - commands I'm going to put all these
05:20 - commands in the description of this
05:22 - video so you can directly copy and paste
05:25 - these commands into your terminal
05:28 - so this uh
05:30 - dpkg hyphen I command we have already
05:33 - executed now we need to give this
05:36 - command so I'm going to copy this and
05:40 - paste it here and this command is sudo
05:43 - update alternatives
05:46 - hyphen hyphen install and then the path
05:50 - of java which is user forward slash bin
05:53 - for slash Java and then space Java and
05:57 - then this jvm file path right so just
06:01 - give this command it will be there in
06:03 - the description of this video I'm going
06:05 - to press enter
06:06 - and you can see update on alternative
06:10 - using this path to provide this path
06:14 - right
06:16 - now if you face any problem right for
06:21 - example uh you are have installed Java
06:25 - jdk 21 then this command is not going to
06:29 - work because you can see the path here
06:32 - is 20. so if this command fails then you
06:37 - just need to find out what's the exact
06:40 - path of your Java installation so for
06:43 - solving that problem you can simply
06:46 - write forward slash use user so
06:50 - basically we are typing this path right
06:53 - so user lib jvm and then whatever is the
06:57 - version of jdk in your case you just
06:59 - need to give that part so user live
07:04 - forward slash jvm and then you can see I
07:09 - have this jdk 20 but in in your case it
07:12 - can be 21 22 or some other version so go
07:16 - until user lab jvm and here you will see
07:21 - the folder name and that's the exact
07:24 - name you need to give here in this
07:26 - Command right in my case it's jdk20 in
07:29 - your case it can be different so you
07:31 - need to replace this folder name here in
07:35 - this Command right
07:37 - similarly we are going to execute the
07:40 - second command for Java C
07:43 - and I'm going to just paste this command
07:46 - and then press enter
07:48 - and this is also successful now once you
07:52 - have executed these two commands you can
07:55 - use this sudo update alternatives
07:58 - to configure Java for example you have
08:02 - different versions of Java on your
08:04 - operating system let's say you have
08:06 - installed open jdk Java version you have
08:10 - installed Oracle Java version you can
08:12 - use this update Alternatives command to
08:16 - config or choose your Java version right
08:20 - so let me show you how you can do this
08:22 - so you can just write sudo update
08:28 - update Alternatives and then hyphen
08:32 - hyphen config and then write Java here
08:35 - and then press enter
08:37 - and for now I have only one alternative
08:40 - for Java which is the Oracle Java
08:44 - version in your case you can see
08:46 - multiple version if you have installed
08:48 - multiple version as I mentioned you
08:51 - might have open jdk Java version you
08:54 - might have Oracle Java version using
08:57 - this command you can select
09:00 - what Java version you want to use right
09:03 - in my case there is only one version so
09:07 - I don't need to choose any version the
09:11 - default version is already selected
09:14 - let's check what version of java we have
09:17 - installed so I'm going to just write
09:19 - Java hyphen hyphen version here and then
09:22 - press enter and now I can see
09:25 - that I have Java
09:29 - 20.0.1 now some applications also
09:33 - requires Java home to be set on your
09:37 - operating system Java home is a
09:40 - environment variable you can set on your
09:43 - Ubuntu operating system and while
09:45 - developing some Java program or using
09:47 - some Java applications uh some
09:50 - applications require Java home right so
09:53 - let me show you how you can set the Java
09:55 - home environment variable also
09:58 - so let me clear the terminal Java is
10:01 - already installed so we can set the Java
10:04 - home environment variable for this give
10:07 - this command sudo and then choose your
10:10 - favorite editor it can be Nano
10:14 - it can be Vim it can be any editor right
10:18 - so I'm going to use G edit here which is
10:23 - the default GUI editor which comes with
10:26 - Ubuntu operating system also you can
10:29 - choose Nano or Vim as I mentioned
10:31 - then forward slash EDC forward slash
10:36 - environment and then press enter
10:39 - it's going to open this path in the text
10:44 - editor go at the very end and then press
10:47 - enter and here just write Java
10:49 - underscore home all in capital is equal
10:53 - to and then give these double quotes
10:57 - here and then you need to give the path
11:00 - to your Java jdk folder you can find
11:04 - your Java jdk location as I have
11:07 - mentioned earlier in this video uh the
11:10 - Java jdk is Java jdk is installed in
11:14 - user so just write user lab
11:18 - forward slash jvm and then the name of
11:22 - your Java directory which is jdk20 in my
11:25 - case it can be different in your case
11:27 - right
11:28 - so
11:30 - you just need to uh
11:32 - give this path here so just copy the
11:36 - path to this directory right user live
11:39 - jvm and then whatever jdk version you
11:42 - have and then paste it between these two
11:47 - double quotes right once you have done
11:50 - that just save your file Ctrl s and just
11:55 - close your file you can also press this
11:57 - save button and then close your file
11:59 - right once that is done what you need to
12:03 - do you can give this command so let me
12:06 - clear the terminal
12:08 - and then just write
12:11 - Source forward slash Etc power slash
12:15 - environment
12:17 - so because we have set a new environment
12:19 - variable in the
12:21 - ETC forward slash environment file we
12:24 - need to update uh that into our bash RC
12:29 - right so just um
12:31 - give this command and once you are done
12:34 - you can give the echo command
12:37 - to know the Java home environment
12:39 - variable value so give echo space dollar
12:44 - Java underscore home press enter and
12:48 - it's going to give you the path of your
12:51 - jdk folder so this is how you can set
12:54 - the Java home environment variable so
12:56 - this is how you can download and install
12:59 - and configure Java on your Ubuntu
13:02 - operating system I hope you've enjoyed
13:04 - this video and I will see you in the
13:06 - next video
