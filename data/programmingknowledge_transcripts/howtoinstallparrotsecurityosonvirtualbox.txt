00:00 - hello and welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge so in today's video I will be
00:03 - showing you how to install peridot S on
00:06 - your VirtualBox so let's get started so
00:10 - right now we are on now / at Linux dot
00:14 - orgy the parrot OS website so here you
00:18 - can see it is saying discover the parrot
00:21 - in yours and get get the most from our
00:23 - awesome Debian based platform so you can
00:27 - see it is Z and Linux restriction system
00:32 - security privacy in development you will
00:35 - get full development stack if you want
00:37 - to create different ex-wives etc all
00:40 - those things it is secure free it is GPL
00:44 - that is general public license so you
00:47 - can work on it freely modified it it is
00:50 - very lightweight so here they are given
00:54 - some screenshots you can go through that
00:56 - so will go on top and or in select
00:58 - download
01:06 - so in here we held three options first
01:09 - one is security that is all in one
01:12 - environment for pentesting privacy
01:14 - digital forensics reverse engineering
01:17 - and software development second one is
01:19 - the home workstation this is very
01:21 - lightweight system for daily use and
01:23 - privacy protection this is designed for
01:26 - the casual users the other builds are
01:29 - particularly for different devices like
01:32 - IOT etc they in booking they include arm
01:36 - images and other custom body shots also
01:38 - and they are also giving links to the s
01:42 - your image writer this is to write image
01:44 - file or ISO image file to the pendrive
01:48 - to make a bootable then the parrot are
01:51 - chilly here so we'll click on SEC you to
01:53 - download so in here we have three
01:58 - options first one is Live Plus installer
02:00 - ISO second one is also same the
02:04 - difference between both of them is the
02:07 - interface is different first one is made
02:10 - interface the second one is kd+ my
02:13 - interface size is also different so we
02:16 - can download it or find the mirrors or
02:18 - torrent it and you can just change check
02:22 - the hashes afterwards third one is
02:25 - particularly we are interested in
02:27 - virtual appliance security retention so
02:29 - interfaces mate so there are different
02:33 - interfaces you have made
02:35 - we have KDE we have xfce all those
02:40 - things we also genome so this particular
02:43 - is you know made interface and this is
02:46 - particularly for virtual machines and
02:48 - formattings over open virtualization
02:51 - format and size is 5.7 cheapy so you can
02:54 - click on download or you can go through
02:56 - torrent if you want if you want to do it
02:58 - using torrent client I will click on
03:01 - download so actually I already
03:07 - downloaded it so I will just cancel it
03:10 - ok so we'll open our VirtualBox so ok
03:16 - so in here you can see on the top menu
03:21 - bar we have a file so click on file and
03:23 - then click on import appliance and here
03:28 - we have to find a directory where our
03:30 - OVA file is present so click on this
03:32 - icon and we'll go in our directory and
03:36 - here we have our OVA file bad at
03:39 - Security 4.7 and we'll open it and now
03:43 - we'll click on continue' name is better
03:48 - security so this will give you different
03:51 - settings of this appliance so CPU is CPU
03:56 - pores are 4 instead of this we'll just
04:02 - tweak it a little bit so if you have a
04:05 - powerful CPU can just select CPU as for
04:07 - RAM is 4gb by default DVD USB controller
04:12 - all selected then yeah after the things
04:15 - are ok so we'll just go back and for
04:19 - this tutorial I will just go to expert
04:22 - mode and insolent appliance and pattered
04:29 - Security OS open and in here will change
04:35 - the CPU from 4 to 1 and Ram I will to
04:44 - use 2 to is enough for this tutorial and
04:52 - threshold things are same and now it's
04:56 - click on import so it will give you a
05:00 - dialog box where to say click agree to
05:02 - continue this is what is a software
05:07 - license settlement if you want you can
05:09 - read it I will click on agree and it
05:13 - will now start importing
05:17 - so which trains 2 minutes 19 seconds
05:19 - remaining so depending on systems
05:26 - specification this counter loop is or
05:29 - decrease so in right now it is on second
05:33 - step so there are actually three steps
05:35 - so it is importing the virtual disk
05:37 - image to the VMDK file in wait till it
05:45 - gets completed
05:50 - so now it is imported as you can see so
05:54 - you can see base memory is 2 GB that is
05:56 - 2 0 9 6 MB and we have to remember it is
06:00 - 128 MB fit is ok ok so things looks
06:09 - great I will click on start so it is
06:20 - clearly an error that if condition of
06:21 - the SVT points are all not fun so we
06:29 - will desire bio 2.0 for now so we click
06:32 - on settings so it is saying very
06:38 - settings detected so the test for the
06:40 - ports in vini here to port to port 2 vs
06:46 - b it is same USB 2.0 for now it's still
06:48 - at USB 1.1 so if you can see it ability
06:51 - to any valid settings are attracted for
06:54 - the 2.0 and 3.0 so we say 1.1 we click
06:57 - OK and now we will start para security
07:01 - virtual machine
07:07 - so it is asking me for which one you
07:11 - want to use pirates cheering Linux so by
07:14 - default isolated the same if you have
07:18 - nvidia are same some other graphics card
07:21 - can select the different settings
07:23 - according to that so it is now loading
07:26 - the parrot OS
07:48 - okay so it is asking for an update er
07:51 - don't date system settings and to import
07:55 - the latest features so we have to select
08:01 - our keyboard layout so I will choose yes
08:12 - I want to check for updates so the
08:14 - default password is the reverse order
08:18 - root that is T over R and okay we'll
08:23 - click which will check for updates only
08:26 - put it aside you select English us that
08:31 - is enough you can test our keyboard yeah
08:42 - keep okay so keyboard layout is set and
08:46 - it is checking for updates now so in
08:52 - here we on the text of the air pass not
08:54 - tht file so if you open it it will show
08:57 - you the default username is user in
08:59 - default password is store in the root
09:02 - password is also true to change the
09:04 - mouse or use the command pas is wth
09:07 - password come out
09:11 - so I think this will take time for
09:16 - updating so we'll go in applications and
09:22 - okay actually we'll go from down so you
09:24 - click on menu and then control center
09:26 - and here we'll go to this place yeah so
09:33 - in here you can choose the resolution so
09:35 - how it shows according to my screen
09:37 - resolution that is 1440 into 900 so
09:43 - apply so you say keep this configuration
09:46 - I want to make it fullscreen so let's
09:50 - make it full screen and then select keep
09:51 - this concentration okay
09:53 - apply this configuration and and we will
09:57 - close it so as you can see the
10:00 - resolution is not full screen and it is
10:02 - perfectly fitting my full screen window
10:05 - so we I will show you what are different
10:08 - tools available in the parrot way so you
10:11 - can go in applications and then we will
10:13 - go in accessories you can see the
10:15 - different tools we here we have vs
10:18 - podium beam so we s corium is actually
10:21 - the open source open source port of
10:24 - visual studio code so it actually
10:28 - provides so more features on years code
10:30 - and it's really open source you can take
10:33 - look at it if you want to do development
10:35 - on now better 2 s so let's go in the
