00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - Eclipse IDE on your Windows 10 operating
00:08 - system so Eclipse is mostly written in
00:12 - Java and it's primarily used for
00:16 - developing java applications but you can
00:19 - install some plugins related to some
00:23 - other programming languages like c c++
00:27 - air long groovy haskell PHP Python and
00:32 - so on to develop those languages also
00:36 - now before installing Eclipse make sure
00:40 - that you have Java installed on your
00:43 - windows operating system and I have
00:46 - already created a video on how to
00:48 - install java jdk on your windows 10
00:52 - operating system so most probably I will
00:54 - just put the link in in the description
00:57 - so you can watch that video and once
01:00 - Java is installed on your windows
01:02 - operating system we are ready to install
01:05 - Eclipse IDE so just open your favorite
01:09 - browser and then just search for Eclipse
01:13 - IDE and the first link which will appear
01:16 - here will be from Eclipse dot G so I'm
01:19 - going to just click on this link and
01:21 - once this Eclipse dot o-- r-- g--
01:23 - website is open you can see on the top
01:26 - this download button so i'm going to
01:29 - just click on this download button and
01:30 - then i will scroll down a little and you
01:34 - can see this option which says eclipse
01:36 - ide 2019 - 12 and then the download
01:43 - button for 64-bit Eclipse IDE so I'm
01:46 - going to just click on this download
01:49 - 64-bit and here
01:52 - you can see once again this download
01:54 - button it's going to show you the
01:57 - location which is nearer to you so now
02:02 - I'm going to just click on the download
02:05 - button which will start the download of
02:07 - this Eclipse when 64 exe file now
02:13 - I have already downloaded this
02:15 - executable file so I will cancel this
02:19 - download and I will go to my downloads
02:22 - folder and here I have already
02:25 - downloaded my X ellipse inst - wind 64
02:31 - dot exe file so I will go to the folder
02:34 - where I have downloaded it and I can
02:36 - just click on this Eclipse executable
02:40 - file and I will just minimize my browser
02:43 - and you can see the Eclipse installer
02:47 - has been started and after a few seconds
02:50 - you will be able to see this kind of
02:52 - interface and here you can choose
02:55 - whatever language you want to develop on
02:59 - eclipse you can choose that language so
03:02 - I wanted to use Eclipse for developing
03:06 - my Java programs so I will choose this
03:09 - first option but for example if you want
03:12 - to develop C or C++ applications you can
03:15 - choose this third option or if you want
03:18 - to develop PHP on your Eclipse IDE you
03:21 - can choose this PHP option here okay so
03:26 - I will choose this option which is
03:28 - Eclipse IDE for Java developers and this
03:32 - will be the location where you have
03:35 - already installed Java on your Windows
03:39 - 10 operating system so Eclipse will
03:42 - recognize the Java installation on your
03:46 - Windows 10 operating system and you can
03:49 - see the default location where Eclipse
03:52 - IDE will be installed on your Windows
03:54 - operating system so I will leave both of
03:57 - them as default and also I will leave
04:00 - this create Start menu entry and create
04:04 - desktop shortcut as default as checked
04:08 - and then click on install and then
04:12 - accept license terms and conditions and
04:15 - now I can see this Eclipse Foundation
04:17 - software User Agreement here so I will
04:21 - just say remember accepted license and
04:25 - then I will just
04:26 - say except once again so when I choose
04:29 - this Eclipse IDE for Java developers you
04:32 - can see in the description here the
04:35 - essential tool for any Java developer
04:37 - including a Java IDE a git client which
04:42 - is a version control client XML editor
04:47 - Milan maven and Gradle integration comes
04:51 - with this installation of Eclipse for
04:56 - Java developers and in-between the
04:59 - installation process I can see this
05:01 - window also which is for the certificate
05:04 - so I will just check all these options
05:07 - which are visible here and I will also
05:10 - check remember accepted certificates
05:12 - here and also I will check this option
05:16 - which says always accept certificates
05:19 - and then I will say accept selected and
05:22 - now I can see that the installation is
05:26 - completed and I can also see this
05:28 - Eclipse IDE icon on my desktop and also
05:32 - I can see this launch green button which
05:36 - when I click will start the Eclipse IDE
05:39 - on my Windows 10 operating system so I
05:42 - will just click on this launch button
05:44 - and when Eclipse IDE starts for the
05:48 - first time on your Windows 10 operating
05:50 - system it will ask you to select a
05:53 - directory as a workspace so this will be
05:56 - the location where all your projects
05:58 - will be saved on your Windows 10
06:01 - operating system so if you don't have
06:03 - the good reason to change this location
06:06 - just leave it as default and then you
06:10 - can also check this option which says
06:12 - use this as the default and do not ask
06:15 - again so just check this checkbox and
06:18 - then click on launch and now this
06:23 - Eclipse IDE has been started so this is
06:26 - the first welcome window you will see
06:27 - when you start your Eclipse IDE so from
06:31 - here you can click on the restore button
06:34 - which is this small icon on the left
06:39 - hand side
06:40 - so now let's create a simple java
06:43 - application using eclipse to see whether
06:47 - everything is working fine or not so for
06:51 - this welcome window I will just minimize
06:53 - this welcome window here and then I will
06:56 - go to the files option and then I will
06:58 - just click on new and I will just click
07:02 - on Java project because I wanted to
07:04 - create a Java project and here I will
07:07 - name my project as hello world and then
07:13 - here you can see the location of your
07:16 - project where it will be saved by
07:19 - default it will be saved in the
07:21 - directory you have already chosen and
07:23 - now the use and execution environment
07:28 - JRE so I have already installed java SE
07:32 - 13 on my Windows 10 operating system so
07:35 - it will give me this option in your case
07:39 - it can give you different options
07:41 - depending upon the Java version you have
07:44 - on your Windows operating system so I
07:48 - will leave this as default in the third
07:50 - category here I can see two options use
07:53 - project folder as the root for source
07:56 - and class files and second option is
07:59 - create separate folder for source and
08:01 - class files so I will leave this also as
08:04 - default and then I will just click on
08:07 - next and this will be the folder
08:09 - structure of my hello world project so
08:13 - now I will just click on the finish
08:15 - button and then I will just click on
08:18 - this check box and then I will just say
08:20 - create so this will create this hello
08:23 - world project for me for now I just want
08:27 - to create a very simple Java file so I
08:29 - will just delete this module info dot
08:33 - Java file and now here inside this
08:37 - source package I will just create a very
08:40 - simple Java class so I'm going to just
08:44 - say class and the name of the class I
08:48 - will name it as hello dot Java okay so I
08:52 - will just right
08:54 - hello here and this will be a public
08:57 - class and I want to create the public
09:01 - static void main method inside this
09:03 - class also so I will check this option
09:05 - also and then I will click on finish
09:08 - which will create this class for me and
09:12 - inside this class this public static
09:14 - void main function is also created which
09:17 - is the main entry point so let's print
09:20 - something using this program so I'm
09:23 - going to just write system so I will
09:25 - just write sy and then I can just press
09:29 - control-shift
09:30 - to see all the intellisense option and
09:34 - then i will just write system dot out
09:37 - and then inside the parenthesis I'm
09:40 - going to just print my hello world
09:43 - message now here if you want to increase
09:45 - the font size of your code so right now
09:49 - maybe it's less visible so I will
09:52 - increase the font size of my editor so I
09:56 - will just click on windows and then
09:58 - preferences option here and then here I
10:02 - will just go to the general section and
10:06 - then the appearance section and then
10:08 - here I will click on the colors and font
10:12 - here and here I will click on the Java
10:15 - option and then I will click on the Java
10:18 - editor text font and then I will just
10:21 - add it this font to a bigger font let's
10:24 - say 16 and then I will click OK and then
10:28 - I will apply and apply close so you can
10:31 - see the font size is increased now so
10:34 - once you have written your program you
10:36 - can just build your program and run your
10:38 - program so for building and running your
10:41 - program you have these options on the
10:44 - top so I will just click on this run
10:47 - HelloWorld dot Java button here which
10:50 - will just compile my Java program and
10:53 - then display the result on this console
10:56 - so this is how you can download and
10:59 - install and use Eclipse IDE on your
11:03 - Windows 10 operating system I hope you
11:06 - have enjoyed this video and
11:07 - we'll see you in the next video
