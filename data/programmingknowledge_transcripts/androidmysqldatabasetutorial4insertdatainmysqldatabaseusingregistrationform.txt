00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Android MySQL database tutorial for
00:04 - beginners till now in the series we have
00:07 - seen how we can connect to our MySQL
00:09 - database and how we can create a simple
00:13 - login page and query of a MySQL database
00:17 - using our Android app and PHP script
00:20 - right now in this video I am going to
00:23 - show you how you can insert data into
00:26 - MySQL database using our registration
00:29 - activity on your Android app so let's
00:34 - get started we are going to create a
00:35 - registration activity in a while but
00:38 - first of all what we are going to do is
00:41 - we are going to create a PHP script for
00:44 - registration
00:45 - okay so we are going to create a new PHP
00:50 - file so first of all what we are going
00:52 - to do we are going to first of all if
00:55 - your vamp server is not started just
00:58 - start your web server because I will be
01:00 - using this localhost web server for this
01:03 - demonstration if you want to use online
01:05 - database it's perfectly fine and then go
01:10 - to dub dub dub directory here in Gramps
01:13 - server and in here our corn dot PHP and
01:17 - our login dot PHP is already there okay
01:20 - so we are going to create a registration
01:23 - dot PHP also so new file and we are
01:27 - going to save it as register dot PHP and
01:34 - just save it and then you can see in the
01:39 - folder this registration pH dot PHP is
01:42 - created now in here as we have done in
01:46 - login dot PHP we need to you know add
01:49 - this connection file first of all and
01:52 - then we need to write a query to insert
01:55 - the data and then run the query using
01:58 - PHP script so I'm going to copy all the
02:00 - code from login dot PHP and I will go to
02:04 - register dot PHP and in here I am going
02:07 - to paste it ok and now in our database
02:11 - if you remember let's open our day
02:13 - miss open web server PHP myadmin
02:16 - and in our database let's see what are
02:20 - the column names so this is our table
02:23 - name employee data and the column names
02:25 - are name surname age username and
02:28 - password ID is auto incremental so we
02:31 - don't need it right so right now we have
02:35 - two variables we are going to create two
02:38 - more or three more rather and the first
02:43 - is the name variable second variable I'm
02:47 - going to name it as surname third
02:51 - variable is the age fourth variable is
02:54 - the password and the fifth variable is
02:59 - the username right so and I'm going to
03:04 - just move this above so that we have the
03:07 - sequence username and password right now
03:11 - create the query let's leave these
03:15 - things as default for now we are going
03:18 - to change the name here later but let's
03:21 - create our query first so I am going to
03:24 - just delete all the query and we have
03:26 - MySQL query variable and in here we are
03:29 - going to create a new query now to
03:31 - insert data into the MySQL database you
03:34 - if you know we need insert keyword right
03:38 - so just write insert into your table
03:42 - name your table name is if you remember
03:46 - employee data this one okay
03:49 - so just give the table name and then
03:52 - gave the column names in which you want
03:55 - to insert the data so we have column
03:58 - name name and surname third is age so
04:04 - just write age and let's see fourth and
04:07 - fifth column username and password okay
04:10 - so just give the column name username
04:13 - and password username comma
04:17 - password okay and now we just need to
04:22 - write values so just write values and
04:26 - then in the bracket you need to pass
04:29 - your values so our values are in these
04:31 - variables so just give a single quote
04:35 - here single quotation mark and inside
04:38 - the single quotation mark you need to
04:41 - give your variable name right and you
04:44 - need to give it in the sequence so if
04:46 - the first name here is name then you
04:50 - need to pass the variable for the name
04:52 - itself right and then once again comma
04:55 - and do the same for the rest of the
04:57 - variables okay so I will just copy and
05:01 - paste it four more times and place of
05:05 - this variable I will pass our name here
05:09 - second variable and then the age third
05:14 - variable and the username is the fourth
05:21 - and the password is the fifth right so
05:25 - just copy this password and paste it
05:29 - here okay and let's align our code a
05:35 - little and then this is your query right
05:38 - now in order to run your query we have
05:43 - one more way of running our query so
05:45 - just take your connection variable from
05:49 - your connection dot PHP and in place of
05:53 - this line we are going to just write
05:56 - corn and then we will call the query
06:00 - query method from here so just write
06:04 - query and then we are going to pass our
06:08 - query here and then we are going to
06:11 - equate this value so just write triple
06:14 - equal to instead of double you need to
06:17 - use triple write true okay
06:21 - and you can give any message as you wish
06:26 - so instead of this echo you can write
06:30 - insert successful right and in place of
06:37 - this else echo what you can do is you
06:42 - can write something like this error dot
06:46 - this will be a concatenation operator
06:49 - for us your a query name so query a name
06:52 - variable is MySQL query dot break this
06:56 - will break the line and then just write
06:58 - Conn error so this is going to show you
07:02 - the error if any error exists okay and I
07:07 - forgot to tell you in the last videos if
07:10 - you are opening the connection from
07:13 - MySQL database then you need to close it
07:16 - at the end of your PHP file so just at
07:19 - the last you just need to write close
07:22 - okay just call close here and just give
07:27 - these brackets here okay
07:29 - now let's try to check if this PHP code
07:32 - works or not
07:33 - so I'm going to just give some static
07:37 - values here some random name and the
07:41 - surname instead of this post and the age
07:44 - for example 22 username for example what
07:49 - can be the username ABC and the password
07:53 - this is just for checking we are passing
07:56 - these static values okay now if you
08:00 - remember how we can open our
08:04 - registration dot PHP file you just need
08:07 - to call localhost and then the file name
08:10 - so just write localhost and then instead
08:15 - of this login dot PHP we will just write
08:20 - register dot PHP okay and then just run
08:26 - this ad says insert successful so right
08:30 - now you can see our MySQL database table
08:34 - has two columns or two rows rather and
08:38 - when we refresh our table so just click
08:41 - this button to
08:42 - and now we have the third row okay so
08:49 - the ID username or named so name age and
08:54 - user name and password so we know that
08:57 - our PHP script is working right now once
09:02 - we are done checking we can just pass
09:05 - this post method variable here so
09:09 - instead of this we will just replace
09:12 - them by post everything here five
09:16 - variables and let's say the name of this
09:21 - post method is same so username for
09:24 - username and password for password age
09:27 - for eight name for name and surname for
09:29 - surname okay this should be username
09:32 - okay it's okay
09:33 - so that's your registration dot PHP now
09:38 - once you are done with this we are going
09:39 - to create our new activity so go to your
09:42 - Android studio and in here go to layout
09:46 - and let's create a new activity so new
09:48 - and just search for activity we are
09:52 - going to create a blank activity here
09:54 - and let's name it as register and then
10:00 - click finish and our register activity
10:03 - is created I am going to just delete
10:05 - this component from here and now what we
10:09 - need to do here is we need to place some
10:12 - added text and our button right let's
10:16 - take five added text and our button so I
10:19 - have created these five added text and I
10:22 - have given some hints to these added
10:24 - text so if you don't know how to give
10:27 - hints you just need to select and search
10:30 - for hint property here and change the
10:33 - hint property okay so five added text
10:35 - and the hint and the name of these added
10:38 - text I have changed to ET name it is
10:40 - surname ET age ET username and 80
10:43 - password and I have taken one button
10:45 - which I have
10:47 - named it as register and the ID of this
10:51 - button is BTN re G for button register
10:54 - okay and now I'm going to go to the text
10:57 - section of this activity and in the
11:01 - button element I'm going to add
11:04 - onclicked method here so just write
11:07 - Android coolin on click click and in
11:11 - here you can just write on re G for one
11:15 - register and just copy this method from
11:18 - here and go to your register dot Java
11:22 - class which you have created and in here
11:24 - we don't need these method we just need
11:27 - on create method and in here we are
11:30 - going to create a method for on register
11:34 - right so public and this will be a void
11:38 - method and the name is same as we have
11:41 - given in on click method and this is
11:43 - going to take mu once again mu and
11:47 - inside the method we are going to write
11:50 - some code but let's first define some
11:53 - added text variables here and some
11:56 - string variables here so just write
11:59 - added text
12:08 - so I have defined these five added text
12:11 - variable and I'm going to define same
12:14 - string variables also and I have defined
12:17 - these five string variables for the five
12:20 - columns right now I'm going to go inside
12:23 - my on create method and I'm going to
12:25 - cast these edit text one by one so name
12:28 - is equal to bracket added text and then
12:33 - you just need to write find view by ID
12:36 - and then r dot ID dot the et name right
12:42 - so et and then the name okay so do the
12:47 - same for the rest of the five
12:56 - you
12:59 - once you're typecasting of your added
13:02 - text variables are done what we are
13:04 - going to do is we are going to go to our
13:06 - main activity dot Java file and in here
13:10 - if you remember in the last videos we
13:12 - have created on login method so just
13:15 - copy the code from unlocked login method
13:18 - and this method what it was doing
13:20 - basically is it was taking the text from
13:23 - your edit text and then passing these
13:27 - values in your background worker object
13:30 - ok so just copy the same code from here
13:32 - and then go to your register dot Java
13:35 - file and in on register method just
13:39 - paste this code and obviously it's going
13:42 - to give this error because we need to
13:44 - change these values from these added
13:47 - text values so I'm just going to copy
13:50 - these few times five times to be precise
13:55 - and then just change these values name
13:59 - surname age username and password and
14:08 - also change these variable names so we
14:10 - have defined these variable names here
14:12 - string name string surname string age
14:17 - string username and string password so
14:22 - in the you know last videos we have
14:25 - defined these string variables locally
14:28 - not globally in your main activity dot
14:31 - Java file so we are going to do the same
14:33 - in your register dot Java file and we
14:37 - can delete these global variables which
14:40 - we have declared right so local is also
14:43 - okay in our case okay now you can see
14:47 - here our background worker execute takes
14:51 - some variables basically we can pass
14:55 - these variables as an argument here so
15:00 - we will pass these variables one by one
15:03 - so first is string name second is STR
15:08 - surname third is STR a
15:11 - age fourth is a steer username and fifth
15:17 - is steer password okay and you can see
15:23 - here our type here in the last video we
15:27 - have defined for login it was login must
15:30 - for the register we will define here
15:32 - register here
15:34 - so this on register method is done now
15:37 - how we are going to open this register
15:41 - activity from our main activity so what
15:44 - we are going to do next is we are going
15:46 - to go to our activity underscore main
15:48 - dot XML file here and we are going to
15:51 - take one more button so just search for
15:54 - one more button and in here we are going
15:58 - to change the text here register and the
16:01 - ID here for example BTN our eg and when
16:05 - we click this register button we want to
16:09 - open our register activity so go to the
16:12 - text and in the button of this register
16:16 - button we are going to create our own
16:19 - click method and we will say open
16:23 - register just right open our eg okay and
16:29 - create the same method in your main
16:32 - activity dot Java file so in here we are
16:35 - going to create a public void open
16:41 - register method and just pass your view
16:44 - and view and basically inside this
16:48 - method we want to open or start our
16:51 - activity so just call a start activity
16:54 - method and it's going to take new intent
16:59 - right so just write new intent and this
17:03 - takes two parameter first is this and
17:07 - the second is the class name so register
17:11 - dot class right register dot class okay
17:18 - so what this basically going to do is
17:21 - it's going to start the activity
17:23 - register
17:24 - so what this startactivity is going to
17:27 - do is it's going to start the register
17:29 - activity now once we are done with all
17:32 - this code now we want to go to our
17:34 - background worker to identify if this
17:38 - request is login or register request
17:42 - right so first of all we will create our
17:45 - URL so let's copy this variable login
17:49 - URL and we will name this variable as
17:53 - register URL register URL and the last
17:58 - video I have changed this IP address to
18:01 - my website name but you can you know for
18:05 - the localhost you can change it to your
18:07 - localhost so I'm going to once again
18:09 - open my command prompt and in the
18:12 - command prompt I'm going to just write
18:14 - IP config and it's going to give my IP
18:20 - here so my IP is 192.168.1.1 the same IP
18:27 - 192.168.1.1 I'm going to just paste the
18:35 - same IP here also okay and this will be
18:39 - our register dot PHP if you remember we
18:42 - have created this file register dot PHP
18:45 - you can just copy the name from here and
18:47 - you can paste it here right now we want
18:54 - to distinguish the type of which we want
18:58 - to parse so in the last video we have
19:01 - defined this condition if type dot
19:03 - equals log in then just you know execute
19:08 - this method otherwise we are going to
19:10 - create one more if conditions will go at
19:13 - the end of this if condition this is the
19:15 - end of this if condition and just write
19:18 - else if type dot equals register right
19:24 - so let's just complete the if condition
19:26 - here so instead of login if you go to
19:29 - register dot Java we have defined the
19:31 - type register just copy the same
19:35 - no name from here and go to your
19:38 - background worker or Java and paste it
19:40 - here
19:40 - right so if the type equals register
19:43 - what we want to do so basically we want
19:46 - to do the same we want to post the
19:49 - request to our PHP page so we will just
19:52 - copy the same code as we have in our if
19:55 - condition for login to the end and this
20:00 - is the act I think for the if condition
20:03 - so just copy the whole code from here
20:05 - and paste it in your if condition for
20:09 - register okay
20:11 - so paste the same code now at the top
20:14 - here we need to define five variable
20:18 - instead of two variables for
20:20 - registration
20:21 - one is name surname age username and
20:24 - password right so I'm going to define
20:26 - these variable names so just copy them
20:30 - five times and first is the name second
20:36 - is the surname third is the age fourth
20:42 - is the username and fifth is the
20:47 - password and the index you need to
20:50 - change one two this will be the third
20:53 - index this will be the fourth index and
20:56 - this will be the fifth index now next
20:59 - line you can see we have declared the
21:01 - URL variable and we have passed log and
21:04 - underscore URLs instead of this login
21:07 - door underscore URL we need to pass our
21:10 - register underscore URL which is this
21:12 - one okay so copy and paste it here okay
21:17 - and the next line will be the same and
21:19 - we need to go to our post data variable
21:24 - here and in here we were creating our
21:28 - post request right so we need to modify
21:32 - our post request all little so what we
21:35 - need to do is I will just copy this one
21:39 - line three more times right so just
21:42 - Oh down one two and three okay so this
21:48 - is one request separated by end and then
21:52 - second third fourth and fifth and just
21:55 - give the plus sign here
21:58 - concatenation sign for example and
22:01 - something like this okay so this is our
22:04 - request first we will pass the key and
22:10 - then we will pass the value so the key
22:12 - we have defined in our registration dot
22:15 - PHP name surname age username and
22:19 - password these are the key in the post
22:21 - request right so give the same you know
22:25 - a keys here in your double quotes here
22:30 - okay so name it will be so name and then
22:35 - age then username and password I hope
22:40 - the spelling is the same username and
22:43 - password surname I think it's same okay
22:46 - now are the values so values we have
22:49 - defined here string name so just give
22:52 - the name than the surname then the age
22:58 - and then the username and the last one
23:01 - is the password and let's close this
23:04 - bracket I think and from here just
23:07 - remove this so this is our post request
23:10 - right and basically everything will be
23:13 - the same so it's going to return the
23:15 - response and it's going to show this
23:18 - response in the alert box so this is our
23:21 - code for the registration now let's run
23:25 - our code and let's see if it works or
23:28 - not
23:29 - so our app is running now so this is for
23:32 - the login and we need to click
23:35 - registration to go to the next activity
23:38 - so just click register and it's going to
23:41 - open this register activity now let's
23:44 - open our PHP myadmin and let's see how
23:47 - many rows it has so right now it has
23:51 - three rows you can see here I can
23:53 - refresh it and I can see three rules
23:56 - so let's give the food row from here
23:59 - name for example the surname
24:06 - and I'm going to press register button
24:08 - and it gives insert successful and this
24:12 - message is coming from your PHP file you
24:16 - can see this insert successful right and
24:20 - go to your app once again and click
24:23 - anywhere else and let's go to our PHP
24:26 - myadmin and let's refresh this page so
24:29 - refresh it and I can see the food row
24:32 - added to our table but I can see one
24:36 - problem here you can see in the name
24:38 - it's a two line you know name right so
24:42 - one line and two line and this may be
24:45 - due to because we have changed the line
24:48 - in the query here so you just need to
24:50 - keep your query in one line and save it
24:54 - and let's insert the data once again so
24:57 - once again some name
25:06 - and let's click the register button once
25:08 - again and insert is successful go to the
25:12 - PHP myadmin refresh it and now
25:15 - everything is fine okay so in this way
25:19 - you can create a register activity in
25:21 - your android app to insert the data into
25:24 - the MySQL database I hope you enjoyed
