00:00 - hello guys welcome back to this video
00:01 - and this one we're going to install in
00:04 - lck and we are going to see how we can
00:06 - use the Alt key features such as the
00:08 - stammer limit Iser and all this kind of
00:10 - stuff
00:10 - first of all in of TKE is a leading
00:12 - platform for building back and programs
00:14 - to work where the human language it is
00:16 - you it is widely used for initial
00:18 - language processing it has a strong word
00:21 - corpora and lexical resources resources
00:23 - such as walnut which we are going to use
00:26 - later in this tutorial for limit izing
00:27 - and basically you cannot work in a
00:30 - natural language processing field
00:32 - without knowing about an ulti case so
00:34 - first of all we need to install using
00:36 - the install indicates still inside your
00:38 - terminal we're going to initiate the
00:40 - command that install and all TK and of
00:46 - course because I have it here already
00:47 - it's going to tell me that it's already
00:49 - satisfied and don't forget that you can
00:51 - apply this basically by having
00:54 - explanation mark and applying dipped
00:56 - install and all TK it have the same it
00:59 - will have the same result action because
01:01 - this is basically it's the same as
01:03 - applying it to your jumbo so after
01:06 - installing and all ck you need to
01:08 - install some corporate for example some
01:11 - data that it doesn't come pre-installed
01:13 - loose and lck because it has a large
01:15 - size so if you need instead if you need
01:18 - any additional data and your inner
01:19 - ticket you have to start the NL TK and
01:22 - then start and all ticket holders so
01:24 - after installing in all TK you can
01:26 - initialize a Python terminal inside your
01:30 - general or even inside your notebook and
01:32 - then we going to import an old CK so
01:35 - we're going to import you know Tek so
01:38 - this line runs successfully so this
01:40 - means that L TK is really nice old and
01:42 - everything is fine so you can initialize
01:44 - the command l TK download which is
01:47 - basically going to initialize some GUI
01:49 - for you that you can install from it all
01:51 - the packages that have an LLC K you can
01:54 - see here this is the collections these
01:56 - are the corpora and these are the models
01:58 - and all the these are all the packages
02:00 - you can basically go here and install
02:02 - all the packages if you have the enough
02:03 - space and you're going to deal with an
02:05 - SDK for a long time and it's instead you
02:08 - can just go through the core and install
02:10 - the program that you want the corporate
02:12 - that we're going to need is word
02:13 - so make sure you have worn it installed
02:15 - and here we're going to install it and
02:18 - of course it tells me that the package
02:20 - rodent is up-to-date because every
02:21 - downloaded so that's how you install
02:23 - indicate and its data so you have all
02:26 - these documented here in this notebook
02:28 - so if you needed to go back to it any
02:31 - time you'll find it documented here so
02:33 - let's get started first by import in lck
02:35 - in our notebook and have some text here
02:38 - the text here please notice that the
02:40 - text here have wasn't which is which has
02:43 - a comma here and we're going to deal
02:45 - with tokenizer x' first let's see the
02:47 - normal tokenizer the register that we
02:49 - have built before which was surpassing
02:52 - the split function of the string and you
02:54 - can see here that we have wasn't as a
02:57 - single word in some cases we need to
03:00 - interpret wasn't as two different words
03:02 - was and not because basically wasn't and
03:06 - was we will treat it differently but we
03:09 - need to have words and not because then
03:12 - we can deal with negation and we know
03:14 - that this was is negated by the nut so
03:19 - let's take a look at the Dukan Iser of
03:21 - the NL c k we have alt key what second
03:24 - eyes so let's see the abbot of it and
03:26 - you can see here that close and not are
03:28 - separated bows and odd are different
03:30 - tokens and this can be very useful in
03:33 - some cases so first we have a words
03:36 - organizer that is better than the moment
03:37 - recognizer and of course you can see
03:39 - here that the empty set is not included
03:41 - in the words so you only have tokens
03:43 - that are actual toppings and not empty
03:45 - space now in to stemming to apply
03:47 - stemming there are multiple algorithms
03:50 - for steaming in lck and in general the
03:52 - poachers tumor at the stimuli that we
03:54 - have talked about in the previous
03:55 - tutorial which basically apply some
03:57 - rules like you're moving some additional
03:59 - characters and you're using that some
04:00 - different characters so the rules for
04:02 - porter stemmer can be found here it is
04:05 - all documented in the NLT cape because
04:08 - it's an open source library so you can
04:09 - find all the code and you can go through
04:13 - it simply so to use a porter stemmer
04:14 - we're going to import the porter stemmer
04:16 - from analytic a dot stem and we're going
04:18 - to initialize an object just an object
04:20 - here we have some words some plural
04:22 - words and we're going to see what the
04:24 - steamer is going to apply to them and
04:26 - can see here this is this is a different
04:29 - way of defining strings when you have
04:31 - some variables and you need to include
04:33 - these variables into the string you just
04:34 - use an F in front of your string and
04:36 - this is basically means that this string
04:38 - is going to be a formatted string and by
04:40 - having career places we're going to
04:41 - define variables inside the string and
04:44 - these variables are going to call the
04:45 - repairs himself here so here we're going
04:47 - to have words and this another key of
04:50 - the places we have going to have the
04:51 - steamer docked stem which is the
04:53 - function that basically stem our string
04:56 - and we're going to pass the words so
04:58 - applying the soap we're going to have
05:00 - each word and it should be its
05:02 - corresponding stem so you can see here
05:04 - that it indeed applied the rule which
05:07 - rule which basically was saying that if
05:09 - we have SPS we're going to reduce it
05:11 - into a single s and we have IES we
05:14 - reduce it into AI and all these controls
05:17 - that we have talked we we have looked
05:19 - into these rules in the previous
05:21 - tutorial and you can double check hits
05:23 - here and this so that's how you use the
05:25 - the stammer the porter stemmer there is
05:27 - another statement that is called the
05:29 - snow pores it snowballs dimmer one of
05:31 - the advantages of snowball stammered
05:34 - over the porter stemmer is that it's
05:36 - afford different languages and you can
05:38 - check the languages that the small ports
05:40 - dimmer support using the snow call
05:42 - center in two languages and you can see
05:44 - here it has Arabic Danish British
05:46 - English French German Italian all these
05:50 - kind of languages you can use and you
05:51 - can see it has the porter stemmer which
05:53 - is basically an English simmer which is
05:55 - this simmer so let's initialize our
05:57 - simmer we're going to initialize it and
05:59 - we need to pass the language that we're
06:02 - going to be using and indeed it going to
06:04 - be the English so here we have the
06:06 - expand esteem results by the cell and
06:08 - let's take a look at the the output of
06:11 - these cells basically most of the time
06:12 - the snow pools dimmer and the porter
06:15 - stemmer have similar results but in some
06:17 - cases the snow bowl streamer is better
06:20 - in most of the cases the small pools
06:22 - dimmer will be better let's take a look
06:23 - at this one we have here the SNS tumor
06:25 - and we are going to stem the generously
06:27 - word take a look at the sim it's
06:29 - generous what about the stammer the
06:31 - porter stemmer
06:32 - if we use the porter stemmer we're going
06:34 - to have it into a Jenner because it's
06:36 - going to just remove all these text
06:39 - so snowballs simmer and porter stemmer
06:41 - are similar similar but these Nobles
06:44 - simmer most of the time have better
06:45 - results so it might be better to go into
06:48 - snowball stammer most of the time so in
06:51 - to limit izing and as we said in the
06:52 - previous tutorial memorizing is about
06:55 - reducing the word into its food to do so
06:57 - we have to have a like a tree bank or a
07:00 - knowledge bank that have all the word
07:03 - and words and it's roads and this called
07:06 - the word net so here we have word net
07:09 - limit Iser in lck that's why we
07:12 - installed and download the word net cord
07:15 - brat from the ltk download so initialize
07:17 - the word new climate Iser using a
07:20 - magnetometer class and let's take a look
07:23 - at the limit ization of all the bluest
07:26 - words that we have defined here and
07:29 - let's take a look at this and flies have
07:33 - been reduced in to fly dyes have been
07:36 - reduced and to die and this might be a
07:39 - little bit weird but this is the route
07:41 - as limit izing see it and you can see
07:44 - here not all the cases are good but most
07:46 - of the key not all the cases are good
07:48 - but each anywhere that it has already
07:51 - route for it it will be reduced into a
07:53 - world so in summary what we have done in
07:55 - this tutorial we have downloaded and
07:58 - installed in Ock and we also know how to
08:00 - download a no TK data we now know how to
08:03 - use the NLT cade second Iser and how it
08:05 - is better than the rejects recognizer we
08:08 - know how we now know how to deal with
08:10 - analytic in stammers how to stem words
08:12 - but in porter stemmer and snowball
08:14 - stammer and also in different languages
08:16 - because we have different languages in
08:18 - the snow pol stammer we know also how to
08:20 - use the word net limit Iser from n LT k
08:24 - so that's it for this video in the next
08:26 - video we are going to deal with
08:27 - different kind of features for alt text
08:30 - specifically the boss tags and the power
08:32 - sentry and we're going to see how we can
08:35 - apply these into our text so see you
08:37 - guys in the next one
