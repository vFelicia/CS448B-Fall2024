00:01 - hello guys in this video I will show you
00:03 - how to play different system sound and
00:06 - beep sound with your Visual Basic
00:08 - Windows Form application so I have this
00:10 - sample project created and I have six
00:14 - six different
00:16 - buttons in here so these button click
00:21 - events are empty so I'm going to write
00:23 - some code here so just drag and drop Six
00:27 - button into your form and change it
00:30 - text now double click this first button
00:34 - and here I will write the code for the
00:36 - first sound so I will write my
00:44 - DOT
00:50 - computer dot
00:52 - audio do play
00:55 - sound and in here I'm going to add add
01:00 - this first system sound which is media.
01:03 - system
01:04 - sounds.
01:06 - estri
01:08 - okay and I will close
01:12 - this and in the same
01:16 - way I'm going to
01:18 - add five more system sounds so this is
01:23 - the second sound but this one is going
01:26 - to be
01:28 - beep third
01:31 - sound and this one is going to be
01:36 - uh exclamation
01:39 - sound and the fourth
01:41 - [Music]
01:42 - button and this one is going to
01:46 - be uh hand
01:49 - sound and the fifth button and this one
01:52 - is going to be a question sound okay and
01:58 - the sixth button I will show you uh
02:00 - differently because the code for the
02:03 - sixth sound is different a little
02:05 - different so let's play uh the code or
02:10 - and see what sound they can make okay so
02:14 - I will just play my
02:19 - program or run my
02:23 - program and it runs the program and
02:26 - let's hear for the sound what sound they
02:29 - make
02:31 - so here for the sport
02:36 - sound I will increase the sound so that
02:40 - you can
02:44 - hear this is the first sound so this is
02:47 - the first sound if you can hear and this
02:51 - is second
02:55 - sound and the third
02:58 - sound
03:02 - and the fourth
03:07 - sound and the fifth
03:11 - sound fifth sound I don't know why but
03:14 - my computer doesn't create the sound but
03:19 - um it should work in other computers and
03:23 - let's uh make the code for the six sound
03:26 - now so I will double click my sixth
03:31 - button and in here I will write
03:39 - uh console dot
03:43 - beep so it creates a beep sound so now
03:49 - when I run the
03:50 - program and I will click the sixth
03:58 - button and it creates a beep sound you
04:02 - can also give uh the frequency and uh
04:06 - the interval to this beep sound like
04:09 - this so you just need to pass the
04:11 - parameter first parameter this beep
04:14 - function takes is the frequency so for
04:17 - example I want the frequency to be
04:19 - thousand and the second parameter it
04:22 - takes is the interval in millisecond so
04:25 - for example I want to give 2 second
04:28 - interval so I will give 2,000 here and
04:32 - now when I run the program it will give
04:34 - me 100 Hertz uh 1,00 her frequency this
04:38 - is the frequency in hertz and this is
04:42 - the time in milliseconds okay so now
04:46 - when I click this sound six button here
04:49 - for
04:52 - it so the sound played for 2 second with
04:56 - the frequency of th000 second you can
04:58 - change this frequency and time and you
05:01 - can have your own sound so in this way
05:04 - you can play different sound with the
05:06 - help of your Visual Basic Windows Form
05:08 - application please keep watching this
05:11 - video and please rate comment and
05:12 - subscribe and bye for now
