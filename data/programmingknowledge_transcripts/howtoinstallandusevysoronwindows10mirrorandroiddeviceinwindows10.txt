00:04 - called visor on your Windows 10
00:07 - operating system so Weiser is a tool
00:10 - which lets you to control and view your
00:14 - android screen on your computer so let's
00:19 - get started and let's see how we can use
00:21 - visor on our Windows 10 operating system
00:24 - so first of all just open your favorite
00:26 - browser and search for V by SOR wiser
00:29 - and the first link which will appear
00:32 - here will be from Weiser so I'm going to
00:33 - just click on this link and once this
00:36 - website is open straight away you will
00:39 - see the Downloads button here so I can
00:43 - just click on this downloads button and
00:45 - once I click on the download button
00:47 - there are these options here we wanted
00:50 - to download the visor on our Windows
00:53 - operating system so I will just click on
00:55 - the windows option which will start the
00:57 - download of this exe file so I will wait
01:01 - for this download to complete so once
01:05 - this executable file is downloaded I
01:07 - will just click on this file and I will
01:10 - just say remove protection and open and
01:13 - then minimize the browser so you can see
01:16 - this window it started this kind of
01:19 - window so now you can see this icon
01:22 - which is available on your desktop and
01:25 - also you can see this window here so
01:28 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
01:31 - just click on these share all devices
01:35 - and International keyboard and now you
01:39 - will see this window which says visor
01:40 - needs to login with your Google account
01:42 - this will open in the new browser so I
01:45 - will just click on this sign-in with
01:47 - Google here and then you will see this
01:50 - kind of code here so just copy this code
01:54 - from here and then I will just paste
01:58 - this code here where wiser wants to be
02:02 - pasted
02:03 - okay so just paste this code and then
02:05 - submit so you will be signed in with
02:09 - your wise account and here I will just
02:12 - say
02:13 - okay and once this is done you will be
02:16 - able to see no device found make sure
02:19 - Android USB debugging is enabled so at
02:22 - this point you can connect your phone to
02:24 - your Windows operating system yiu SP so
02:28 - I'm going to just connect my phone on my
02:31 - Windows operating system via USB and
02:34 - then I will just allow the access here
02:37 - and once I allow the access I will be
02:40 - able to see the serial number here and
02:43 - then I can just click on the view option
02:46 - so I will just click on view which will
02:49 - start this emulator where I will be able
02:52 - to see my Android phone screen on this
02:58 - wiser tool so you can see this is my
03:01 - android screen and let's say I will open
03:05 - this Google Play app here and from my
03:10 - windows also I can just move this these
03:14 - icons with my mouse here so this is my
03:17 - mouse and I am moving and controlling my
03:20 - android using my mouse so this is a cool
03:25 - feature here I can even just click on
03:29 - any app which is going to open that app
03:32 - so everything is working but I see one
03:36 - little problem here and that is the
03:39 - resolution so this resolution is really
03:42 - low here because we are using wiser for
03:45 - free that's why this resolution is
03:49 - really low so if you want to increase
03:52 - the resolution you can go to the
03:53 - settings at the top so just click on
03:56 - open device settings and then once again
03:58 - open that window and here all the
04:01 - options which are unchecked or
04:03 - unselected these are the options which
04:07 - are available for the upgraded version
04:09 - so you need to pay something for using
04:13 - those options for example full screen
04:15 - mode when I just click on full screen
04:18 - mode this will just show this window
04:22 - which says full screen mode feature is
04:23 - only available for the pro users
04:26 - so these all options so you can see
04:30 - video quality so right now it's the
04:32 - lowest quality possible which is visible
04:36 - to us but if you want to increase the
04:38 - quality we need to upgrade this visor to
04:42 - the pro version which I don't want to do
04:45 - right now but if your work is such that
04:49 - it involves this wiser app regularly and
04:53 - you want to just show your window on
04:55 - your Windows 10 operating system you can
04:58 - also consider upgrading your wiser tool
05:02 - and then you will be able to see this
05:04 - window resolution in high quality right
05:08 - so this is how you can install and use
05:12 - wiser on your Windows operating system
05:14 - there is one more thing I want to show
05:17 - here so for example I will just close
05:19 - this window and on the wiser window I
05:22 - will remove my USB cable that means I
05:25 - have disconnected my phone from my
05:28 - computer so after connecting your
05:32 - Android phone to your computer if you
05:36 - still see this error that means you have
05:41 - to enable the USB debugging on your
05:44 - Android phone so that process is also
05:47 - easy so if you find any problems after
05:51 - connecting your Android phone to your
05:53 - computer then just click on this link
05:56 - and this will open this kind of webpage
05:58 - which is also from wiser dot IO and in
06:01 - this video it is shown how you can
06:04 - enable your USB debugging on your
06:07 - Android operating system so just follow
06:11 - the steps and enable the USB debugging
06:14 - and once that's done you will be able to
06:18 - use your phone with the wiser tool so
06:21 - that's it for this video I hope you
06:22 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
06:24 - the next video
