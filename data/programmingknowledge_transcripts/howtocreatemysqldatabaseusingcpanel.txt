00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can create your mySQL
00:05 - database using cpanel hosting I'm using
00:10 - my goad hosting for this uh
00:14 - demonstration but you can use any other
00:16 - hosting from any other website and the
00:19 - procedure will be almost the same so
00:22 - first of all just open your C panel and
00:25 - then go to the category called databases
00:29 - and in the databases go to the category
00:32 - called MySQL databases and just click on
00:36 - this
00:37 - category and it will open this kind of
00:41 - interface and First Option here which
00:44 - will appear here will be create a new
00:48 - database so you need to give the new
00:50 - database name for example I want to
00:52 - create a database called employee 101
00:57 - okay so this is the database name right
01:00 - and then just click create database this
01:03 - button
01:07 - here and now you can see uh this
01:10 - database is added right so now you just
01:15 - need to click this go back
01:18 - button and now you can see here this
01:21 - database is added to the list here okay
01:26 - but you can see here privileged user
01:28 - under privileged user there is no user
01:31 - for this database so we are going to
01:34 - create a user for this database so just
01:37 - scroll down and here you will see uh the
01:41 - section called MySQL user add new user
01:44 - so here you can add a new user for
01:47 - example I will give the same name as my
01:50 - database employee
01:53 - 101 so this will be the username and
01:56 - choose uh a strong password for for
02:00 - example the password which you can
02:03 - remember and which is really strong so
02:07 - you can see the strength of your
02:09 - password uh using this progress bar here
02:14 - okay so I will give some uh strong
02:17 - password and repeat the password and you
02:20 - can see the strength of this password is
02:22 - in the green zone which is a good sign
02:27 - and then you just need to uh click this
02:30 - button which says create user so just
02:34 - click this button create
02:37 - user and now you will see the success
02:40 - message and it will say you have
02:43 - successfully created a MySQL user named
02:47 - employee 101 or whatever name you
02:50 - provided so now we have uh employee
02:56 - database and employee user right so we
03:01 - just need to connect this database with
03:04 - the user so go at the bottom here and in
03:08 - here you will see the section called add
03:10 - user to database and you can uh click
03:15 - this combo box and select your usernames
03:18 - from the usern names list and in here
03:21 - you can select the database name so I
03:24 - only have one user and one database name
03:27 - so it's showing the same user and same
03:30 - database name and just click this add
03:33 - button
03:34 - here and it will uh lead you to this web
03:39 - page and it will uh ask you to provide
03:43 - the privilege to your database according
03:45 - to this user so generally we click all
03:48 - privileges so that uh this user have all
03:52 - privileges for altering or creating or
03:56 - selecting or uh deleting the datab
03:59 - datase okay so just select all
04:02 - Privileges and then click make changes
04:05 - button here
04:08 - okay and now you will see this success
04:11 - message that user employee 101 was added
04:15 - to the database employee 101 with the
04:18 - request privileges okay so now the
04:22 - database is connected to the user and in
04:26 - here in the list here current database
04:29 - is you can see privileged user and your
04:33 - username and the database name here okay
04:37 - so now your database is created and user
04:41 - is linked with the database right so
04:45 - just go
04:46 - back to your C panel and now go to the
04:51 - category called database once again and
04:54 - using PHP admin we are going to uh
04:57 - create some tables inside the database
04:59 - so just click PHP my admin from
05:06 - here and it's going to open this kind of
05:10 - interface for PHP my admin and you can
05:13 - see here it has created this employee
05:17 - 101 database which you can select from
05:19 - here and in here you can create the
05:23 - table right so go to the section called
05:26 - structure and in here give the name to
05:28 - your table for example
05:31 - employee data and the number of column
05:35 - it's going to contain for example it's
05:37 - going to contain four columns for me and
05:40 - I will just click okay
05:44 - here and now you can give the column
05:47 - names so for example First Column name
05:50 - is ID second column name is name third
05:54 - column name is surname and fourth column
05:57 - name is age and I can give the type here
06:00 - for example ID has integer type name has
06:05 - text type surname has text type and age
06:09 - has a integer type right and you can
06:12 - also choose whether it's a primary key
06:15 - or not from here and you can also choose
06:19 - Auto increment if you want or null or
06:23 - any other property from here which you
06:25 - like okay and just click
06:28 - save
06:30 - and now your table is created you can
06:33 - see employee data and now to insert some
06:36 - uh data inside this table you can just
06:38 - click insert here and in this insert
06:42 - section you can give some data for
06:45 - example uh employee ID 1 and name is
06:49 - equal to for example Tom you just give
06:52 - the
06:54 - sirname and the age for example 22 okay
06:59 - and then click this button go and then
07:03 - it's going to insert this data into the

07:09 - is inserted in your table or not you can
07:11 - go to search here and once again click
07:14 - this uh category called
07:17 - SQL and now you can uh see here select

07:39 - my database where the ID is one okay so
07:44 - I will click
07:45 - go and now I can see this data which I
07:49 - have inserted in the database okay so in
07:53 - this way you can create mySQL database
07:56 - using C panel I hope you have enjoyed
