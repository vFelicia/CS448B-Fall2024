00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can convert from text to
00:05 - speech using Python we are going to
00:08 - achieve this using a package called G
00:12 - TTS which stands for Google
00:14 - text-to-speech package so G TTS or
00:19 - Google text-to-speech is a Python
00:22 - library and command line tool also to
00:26 - interface with Google translates
00:29 - text-to-speech API so let's get started
00:32 - and let's see how we can convert from
00:34 - text to speech using this G TTS package
00:39 - so first of all you need to have the
00:41 - latest version of Python installed on
00:43 - your operating system so let's check for
00:46 - the Python version first of all so I'm
00:49 - going to open the terminal and I'm going
00:51 - to just type Python - - version and then
00:56 - press ENTER and if you see some output
00:59 - like this in my case the latest version
01:02 - is Python 3 point 7 point 4 at the time
01:06 - of making this video so once you verify
01:08 - that this version is shown on your
01:12 - terminal Python is installed on your
01:14 - system you just need to check one more
01:16 - thing which is PIP is installed on your
01:19 - system or not by default whenever you
01:23 - install Python pip comes packaged with
01:27 - the Python executable so you don't need
01:29 - to install pip in any extra way pip is
01:33 - the Python package manager so just type
01:37 - pip and then type my - - version and
01:41 - then press ENTER and it's going to show
01:44 - you the version of pip which is
01:46 - available for your Python so pip 19
01:51 - point 0.3 is available for my python 3
01:54 - point 7 so if you see this kind of
01:57 - output and this kind of output you are
01:59 - ready to go so the first thing is to
02:03 - install that G TTS package using the pip
02:07 - package manager so to do that I'm going
02:10 - to just type pip install
02:13 - and then type G TTS okay and then press
02:18 - ENTER which is going to start installing
02:20 - this G TTS package on your Windows
02:24 - operating system or any other operating
02:26 - system you are working on and after some
02:29 - time you will see this message which
02:31 - will say something like successfully
02:33 - installed this this this package on your
02:36 - Windows operating system which includes
02:38 - this G TTS package also so once this
02:41 - package is installed we are ready to
02:44 - develop our Python script so let's say I
02:47 - want to develop my Python script inside
02:50 - this work folder I have Visual Studio
02:52 - code so I can open this Visual Studio
02:55 - code and then start creating my Python
02:59 - script you can use any other editor
03:01 - let's create this test dot py file or
03:06 - let's say this will be our text
03:10 - underscore - speech dot py file and then
03:14 - press ENTER to create this file and once
03:17 - this file is created we can just start
03:19 - typing our code so once you have G TTS
03:23 - package you will be able to import it
03:25 - using your Python script so just right
03:28 - from G TTS import G capital TTS also we
03:34 - are going to import the OS package which
03:36 - is available by default on your Python
03:39 - package and now we are going to start
03:43 - writing some text so we are going to
03:46 - just declare a variable called my text
03:50 - for example and then you can provide
03:52 - some text here for example text to
03:54 - speech conversion using Python now in
03:57 - the next step we are going to define the
03:58 - language in which we want to create our
04:01 - audio file so obviously our text is in
04:04 - English so I'm going to define a
04:05 - variable called language so for the
04:07 - English support you just need to write
04:09 - en here for the French support you can
04:12 - write fr here or any other code which is
04:16 - supported by G TTS so for example we
04:20 - just need to add the English language
04:22 - support so just write en and then in the
04:25 - next line we are going to pass our
04:27 - language
04:27 - and our text to the G TTS engine so
04:32 - let's say we are going to define the
04:35 - variable called output first of all and
04:38 - then we will call this G TTS which we
04:41 - have imported using the GTS package and
04:44 - this class takes few arguments 1st
04:48 - argument will be the text so you can
04:50 - just write text is equal to your text
04:53 - variable which is my text the second
04:56 - argument will be the language so I'm
04:58 - going to just say Lang is equal to your
05:02 - language variables so this is our
05:04 - language variable also I'm going to pass
05:07 - this variable called a slow which I'm
05:10 - going to set it to a false value so
05:13 - let's set it to false value this means
05:18 - that we want our audio to be played in
05:21 - high speed not in a slow speed that's
05:24 - why we have said slow is equal to false
05:27 - now once you have this output you can
05:31 - save this into the form of mp3 file so
05:36 - let's use our output variable and then
05:40 - you can call a method called save here
05:44 - so you can call this method called save
05:46 - and then you can define the name of your
05:50 - file here so for example I want to name
05:52 - my audio file as output dot mp3 which is
05:58 - going to create an mp3 file in the same
06:01 - folder in which you are working in and
06:04 - then in the next line we are going to
06:06 - play our mp3 file using the default
06:10 - program so for this you can use the OS
06:13 - module so just right OS dot system and
06:16 - then in the parenthesis you can just
06:18 - write start so just write start and the
06:22 - name of your file which you want to
06:25 - start so the name of my file is output
06:28 - dot mp3 so the start
06:31 - space the name of the file is going to
06:34 - start your mp3 file using the default
06:37 - program which is supported on your
06:40 - windows or
06:41 - system or any other operating system so
06:44 - that's it so this is the script to
06:46 - convert your text into the speech and
06:50 - then convert it into an audio file which
06:54 - is the mp3 file so let's try to run this
06:57 - code now let me open the terminal which
06:59 - is available inside my visual studio
07:01 - code so we will be able to see this
07:04 - output at the same time while this
07:07 - script is running so here I'm going to
07:09 - just type inside the same folder in
07:12 - which I'm working in python and the name
07:15 - of my script which is text to speech dot
07:18 - py and then i am going to press enter
07:21 - and in some time you will see this
07:24 - output dot mp3 file is created here and
07:28 - then it's going to be opened using the
07:32 - default app
07:35 - nice to speech conversion using Python
07:38 - now let's say you want to convert a text
07:41 - file into an mp3 file this is also easy
07:46 - using this G TTS package so let me just
07:50 - close this terminal and this time let's
07:52 - say we just want to read the file and
07:55 - then just convert into an mp3 file so
07:59 - instead of using this my text variable
08:03 - let's define a variable called FH for
08:06 - file handler and then there is a default
08:10 - method inside Python which is called
08:12 - open which is used to open and read the
08:16 - files so here you just need to give the
08:19 - name of your file let's say we have a
08:22 - file called test dot txt this file we
08:26 - are going to create in some seconds so
08:30 - this will be the name of the file
08:31 - the second argument here will be the
08:35 - mode so the mode will be our for read if
08:38 - you write or W here then it's a write
08:41 - mode and if you write R here then it's a
08:45 - read mode now in the next line what I'm
08:49 - going to do is I'm going to declare this
08:51 - my text variable for my text and then
08:55 - I'm going to just say FH dot read this
08:59 - is the function to read your text and
09:02 - then I'm going to replace all the line
09:05 - endings because in the text there might
09:08 - be line and things which this G TTS
09:12 - module might not be able to read them so
09:15 - I'm going to replace all the line
09:16 - endings with the replace function and
09:18 - then I'm going to just say I want to
09:22 - replace all the line endings with the
09:25 - space ok so once you have this my text
09:29 - this variable name is same as the old
09:32 - variable name so we don't need to change
09:35 - this variable here also after you have
09:39 - done reading your file at the end of
09:43 - your script you can also close your file
09:49 - so you can just call a function called
09:51 - closed on your FH variable it's a good
09:54 - practice to close all your file handlers
09:56 - once you are done using them okay so now
10:01 - the only thing remains is the creation
10:05 - of test dot txt file so let's create
10:08 - this test dot txt file so I have this G
10:12 - TTS webpage open here I'm going to just
10:15 - put the link in the description also so
10:18 - I'm going to just copy this content from
10:21 - here and paste it into my file okay so
10:26 - you can see this is the text which I
10:30 - want to convert and let's run our script
10:32 - so I'm going to open a new terminal and
10:34 - here I'm going to just type Python
10:39 - text-to-speech dot P Y and then press
10:41 - Enter
10:42 - which is going to create this output
10:44 - file once again G TTS Google
10:47 - text-to-speech a Python library and CLI
10:51 - tool to interface with Google Translate
10:53 - a circumflex euro s text-to-speech API
10:58 - right spoken mp3 data to a file a file
11:02 - like object byte string audio
11:06 - manipulation so that's it for this video
11:08 - this is how you can convert your text to
11:10 - speech using G TTS module in Python I
11:14 - hope you enjoyed this video and I will
11:16 - see you in the next video
