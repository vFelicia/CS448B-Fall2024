00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:02 - learning about its sales conditions okay
00:04 - so let's start with the video and I hope
00:07 - you are aware of yourself but if not
00:09 - then let me tell you first what about
00:11 - what is this so basically if if else
00:13 - what happens
00:15 - if there will be one condition if that
00:17 - condition satisfies it it is true then
00:20 - the whatever the statement you write
00:22 - inside that if block that would execute
00:24 - okay so without wasting time first of
00:27 - all let me uh tell you about like how
00:29 - will you write this script so that will
00:31 - be easy to understand for you so zero
00:34 - nine I will write here if else
00:37 - dot sh okay we are good to go now
00:41 - okay bin bash okay so here
00:45 - just support this scenario a equal to 10
00:48 - okay if I will write if and the
00:51 - condition is written inside this big
00:55 - bracket okay and here you have to do if
00:59 - a
01:01 - equal to 10.
01:04 - okay
01:05 - so then you have to write like this then
01:09 - then what what do you want yes with this
01:12 - condition satisfy you have to write like
01:14 - this you can do anything here I am doing
01:17 - just printing like a is
01:20 - equal to 10 okay
01:24 - and you can do like in else
01:27 - you can write like this Eco a is not
01:32 - equal
01:35 - equal to 10 okay and then to close the
01:39 - if log you can write like this f i
01:42 - so I will run the Subscribe but before
01:44 - they will need to add the permissions 0
01:47 - magnitude yeah
01:49 - clear the screen dot slash zero nine
01:54 - okay zero nine yeah a is equal to 10
01:58 - what if I do 11 here and run this script
02:02 - so in this case this condition will not
02:04 - satisfy okay so how we can do it 0 9 a
02:09 - is not equal to
02:10 - 10 so I hope you got it how this thing
02:13 - work like if conditions so we will take
02:16 - the scenario of voting system like there
02:21 - will be person age we will take the
02:23 - input from the user I will just comment
02:26 - out these things okay read
02:30 - and I will do here uh
02:34 - page okay
02:37 - or I will prompt for the user enter
02:41 - your age
02:44 - here I will do age okay and we will
02:46 - apply the conditions on this if age
02:51 - where is the dollar if age
02:55 - is greater than equal to
02:58 - 18
02:59 - in this case we will write eco
03:03 - you are eligible
03:10 - cost
03:12 - okay in else condition what we can write
03:16 - ego
03:20 - you are
03:21 - not
03:24 - eligible to cast vote
03:29 - okay and we have to just close this if
03:32 - block
03:33 - control is to save clear the screen
03:37 - enter your age 23 you are able to Castro
03:40 - again
03:41 - 12 you are not eligible to cast what
03:44 - okay if
03:48 - or I can just do a greater than
03:50 - okay and I use one more thing that is
03:54 - alif
03:55 - it's also like the if but if this
03:58 - condition fails it will check for this
04:01 - particular condition here I will write
04:03 - if
04:06 - uh
04:08 - age
04:09 - equal to
04:12 - is equal to how to use equal to 18
04:16 - so in this case
04:19 - I want
04:21 - eco
04:25 - please
04:27 - apply for voter ID card
04:31 - okay and here we will not use 10.
04:36 - so now what we can do clear the screen
04:38 - run the script I will write my age equal
04:41 - to 18.
04:43 - so so what happened
04:47 - okay okay I think we'll write them
04:55 - okay yeah please apply for voter ID card
04:59 - okay so this is the LF condition that's
05:00 - why we will need to write that then okay
05:04 - so right now what's happening whatever
05:06 - the age we are entering so here it is
05:10 - first checking this condition if this
05:11 - condition fails it will come upon this
05:14 - condition so now this condition executes
05:16 - that's why
05:18 - it is giving the output as this line
05:21 - okay what if the output doesn't match
05:24 - with
05:25 - any condition
05:26 - in this case what will happen the else
05:28 - condition will execute you are not
05:30 - eligible to pass towards simple okay so
05:33 - in this way you can use if L if else
05:36 - conditions in your projects okay
05:39 - so that's all for today's videos guys I
