00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in our previous video we saw
00:06 - that how to create tables and basically
00:09 - how to insert values in those tables in
00:12 - this video I will show you how to
00:15 - retrieve the values from those tables so
00:19 - first of all let us see that how to
00:21 - retrieve values from the tables via
00:24 - terminal so open terminal in your
00:28 - computer let me just make peek okay
00:35 - right - QL and you provide password now
00:51 - just let me show you the what are the
00:55 - databases that we have we have data test
01:03 - database here
01:12 - [Music]
01:23 - okay we are in now data this database if
01:28 - you remember we have created one table
01:30 - constant in it let me show you you can
01:37 - say stone table now we want to see what
01:42 - are the records that are present in our
01:45 - student table so the SQL statement for
01:51 - that is select star from then the name
02:00 - of the table in our case it is direct so
02:06 - here you can see we have roll number
02:10 - name and surname and the values that we
02:13 - have inserted in the last time now
02:17 - consider a case where you don't need to
02:21 - show the surname you only require two so
02:25 - roll number and name so right select now
02:35 - specify the name of the caller that you
02:39 - want we want roll number in here you can
02:55 - see now sanam is no longer appearing
03:00 - here we have only roll number and name
03:03 - now you can also change the order in
03:06 - which they are displaying on the screen
03:08 - right select we want name first and then
03:14 - roll number
03:25 - [Music]
03:34 - that's e is missing in select very okay
03:39 - select name from here you can see first
03:45 - it will explain name and then roll
03:48 - number and as I saw you earlier if we
03:52 - want all the columns to be displayed
03:56 - then simply select star from student so
04:01 - now let us see let us open our GUI
04:08 - workbench
04:15 - here we have our database called data
04:18 - rest and in which we have a data table
04:22 - student and it has three columns a roll
04:27 - number name and surname now if we want
04:31 - to display the roll number only then
04:34 - just right click on it and click on the
04:39 - select rows and you can see the roll
04:44 - number is displaying here and the query
04:47 - which runs from the background is select
04:50 - roll number from data test dot student
04:55 - now as I mentioned earlier you can write
05:00 - multiple columns name here select roll
05:04 - number name from do not here you can see
05:15 - roll number and you can write in any
05:21 - other select name
05:26 - then I won't surname and then I won't
05:30 - roll over here name surname and remember
05:45 - now you want every column to be
05:50 - displayed then simply then select star
05:55 - from student here you can see whenever
06:04 - here you can observe and then whenever
06:08 - you write star instead of specific each
06:12 - column name then the table will appear
06:17 - in the same order in which we have
06:20 - defined in our creation time roll number
06:24 - first then name and then surname so if
06:28 - you want to change the order then you
06:31 - have to specify the column name manually
06:33 - here now there is one more thing that I
06:35 - want to show you is that you can also
06:38 - perform normal arithmetic operation is
06:41 - in the Select statement also you if you
06:45 - want to perform addition of two numbers
06:47 - then right select 1 plus 3 suppose from
06:58 - here you can provide ad hominem we
07:02 - provide deal here and execute you can
07:09 - see 1 + 3 4 now not only this you can
07:14 - write a much complex expression here
07:19 - like 2 to 5
07:26 - two three Danny back to let's say here
07:40 - you can also perform modulus around five
07:47 - more dealers to from module and you can
07:56 - see it will give us a mentor and if you
08:02 - if you don't want to write Devon then
08:06 - it's fine you can also write like this
08:12 - we will also give you the same output
08:15 - okay so thanks for watching
