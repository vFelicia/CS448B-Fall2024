00:00 - friends family knowledge in this video
00:03 - we will see how we share and delete all
00:05 - the data of the table in our previous
00:08 - video we saw that how we can dropped a
00:11 - table and in this video we will see if
00:13 - you want to truncate your table then how
00:17 - you can do it so let us first understand
00:20 - the syntax okay so the syntax is pretty
00:32 - obvious truncate because you want to
00:37 - truncate your given in table in the
00:43 - table that you want to truncate and
00:48 - that's it it is syntax now lots of
00:53 - people asking that if they can use the
00:58 - links query to truncate a table my
01:03 - answer is yes you can use delete
01:07 - statement but the work that both the
01:11 - command is is doing is pretty much the
01:13 - same but the approach they are taking is
01:16 - different if I talk about delete query
01:20 - then delete statement first scan the
01:24 - entire table and then delete each one by
01:28 - one if we talk about truncate then it
01:33 - will delete the entire table first it
01:36 - means all the rows will be gone and then
01:39 - recreate it recreate a table with the
01:41 - same schema so if you are working with
01:45 - small table it means that your table
01:49 - does not have that many of Thrones fan
01:52 - it doesn't affect that much if you are
01:56 - using truncate or delete statement but
02:00 - if you are dealing with large amount of
02:03 - data let's say your table contains
02:05 - millions of rows then using delete
02:10 - statement will be more costlier than
02:12 - from
02:13 - statement it puts lots of pressure on
02:16 - this server and it requires a lot of
02:20 - time if I compare it to the truncate so
02:24 - it's better to use truncate table in
02:27 - order to get all the data present in the
02:30 - table so this is this index and let us
02:36 - first open the terminal okay so right
02:46 - psql now let us see the chart the
02:51 - database is present in our system for
02:53 - that use next level okay so we have this
03:00 - database so we are going to inspect for
03:03 - connecting it like that let's see this
03:07 - now we are connected to test database
03:11 - now let us see we target tables
03:13 - presenting tested of us so we have
03:17 - employ table and to develop let us see
03:23 - the data president student table select
03:28 - student basics the next segment and it
03:33 - is a no rows okay it is empty so let us
03:38 - first insert some values in this table
03:41 - in fact values so it has IP and name we
04:00 - can insert multiple values
04:28 - okay
04:40 - okay I forgot to specify the name of the
04:46 - table insert into student okay so four
04:53 - rows has been inserted let us see okay
05:07 - so this is data now I want to delete all
05:10 - the rows all the data present in this
05:12 - table so we are going to use that token
05:15 - come on okay in name of the table just
05:33 - files very truncate table is executed
05:38 - let us see if Devon is present on the
05:41 - SSD mountable and as you can see reading
05:57 - so this is a you can use truncate come
06:01 - on
06:02 - - okay cue table so close your
06:05 - effeminate or ponta German test okay
06:17 - okay so this time we are going to do is
06:19 - employee table so let us see some people
06:23 - are presenting imputable sorry for that
06:35 - okay so it is also empty
06:38 - so let us present some guy
07:23 - okay
07:27 - no Frankie the command will be safe
07:33 - truncate pay them the name of the table
07:37 - that you want to rocket disp an employee
