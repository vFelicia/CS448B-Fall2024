00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - Java FX tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will see what is Java F effect
00:08 - and how it's different from swing which
00:11 - is also a GUI platform for Java so first
00:15 - of all what is Java FS Java f is a media
00:20 - SLG Graphics framework for creating guis
00:24 - in Java applications where GUI stands
00:27 - for graphical user interface and Java FX
00:31 - is intended to replace swing as the
00:34 - standard GUI library for Java software
00:39 - environment now it's more powerful than
00:43 - swing and it can be used to create both
00:47 - desktop and web applications Java FX is
00:51 - like swing which draws its own
00:54 - components and which have lesser
00:56 - communication with OS and it's like
01:00 - lightweight and Hardware
01:02 - accelerated now it make use of a file
01:06 - called fxml which is a new XML based
01:10 - markup language for handling uis okay
01:15 - now let's see uh some history about Java
01:18 - FX first of all for the first time Java
01:22 - FX was announced in May 2007 by sun
01:26 - microsystem and it was released in
01:28 - December 20 08 it was originally brought
01:32 - as a response for flashh and shock wave
01:36 - but one of the intention was also to
01:38 - improve the ease of creating guies for
01:42 - Java application now the latest version
01:45 - of Java FX is Java FX
01:48 - 9 and why we use it so you can see this
01:52 - is a swing uh jframe or you can say
01:56 - swing window which looks like this and
02:00 - let's see how the Java XX window will
02:04 - look like when we create it so this is
02:07 - how the Java FX uh project window will
02:11 - look like whenever you use some widgets
02:15 - of Java FX in the window right so it's
02:19 - much more improved advanced than swing
02:24 - right so it can be the replacement of
02:28 - the Swing now I have one example I have
02:32 - created the hello world window for the
02:35 - swing application and the Java effects
02:40 - and you can see the difference so this
02:42 - is on my right is the swing jframe and
02:47 - here is the Java FX scene and you can
02:51 - see the difference between them the Java
02:54 - FX is more flexible and it looks more
02:59 - attractive
03:00 - and it has much more functionality than
03:03 - Java Swing okay now in addition Oracle
03:07 - provides you the Java FX scene Builder
03:11 - which is a visual user interface design
03:14 - tool and by using it you don't need to
03:16 - spend n number of uh hours anymore on
03:21 - trying to move a button little bit on
03:24 - the left or right or little bit
03:26 - adjusting its color right Java f has the
03:30 - ability to apply CSS on the component of
03:33 - the UI opens a door for better looking
03:37 - application that are more attractive to
03:40 - the end user it also has 3D support now
03:45 - before Java FX version 2 Java FX was
03:50 - made to use Java FX script so it was
03:55 - using Java FX script and using that it
03:59 - was was uh you know creating the scenes
04:02 - and stages and uh the windows right but
04:06 - it was uh until the version 2.0 which
04:10 - was deprecated after version 2.0 and
04:14 - from 2.0 onwards fxml has been
04:17 - introduced which is more powerful and
04:20 - XML based one advantage of it is all
04:24 - developers has the knowledge of XML so
04:28 - which is a benefit right now fxml is a
04:32 - declarative XML based language which is
04:36 - easy to use okay now you may ask which
04:39 - one is better Java F or swing so GUI
04:45 - which are created using Java effects a
04:48 - lot faster than swing or awt
04:52 - applications Java FX gives you more
04:55 - sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing
04:59 - UI is in Java FX it's really easy to
05:02 - integrate sounds images video or web
05:05 - content Java FX code is really
05:09 - simplified by separating the UI from the
05:12 - logic of the application and Java FX can
05:15 - be integrated in swing application
05:18 - allowing for the smoother transaction
05:22 - now Java FX terminology is little bit
05:25 - different from swing so the main window
05:28 - of Java FX
05:30 - on which every wiget or component
05:33 - resides on is called stage okay and on
05:37 - top of it there is a scene so there is a
05:41 - framework called scene and on scene you
05:45 - can add the widgets something like
05:48 - buttons labels or other widgets okay so
05:53 - this is the basic uh framework for Java
05:57 - FX window so you have the stage scenes
06:01 - and then your widgets so that's it for
06:05 - this video in the next video we will see
06:08 - how we can install and run our first
06:11 - application in Java FX so stay tuned and
06:14 - please wait comment and subscribe and
06:16 - bye for now
