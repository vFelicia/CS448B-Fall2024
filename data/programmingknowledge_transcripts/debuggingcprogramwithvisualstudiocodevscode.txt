00:00 - now inside the c apps let me create a
00:04 - very simple C file so I'm going to click
00:07 - on this new file button I can even click
00:11 - on file and then click on new file
00:13 - and
00:15 - from here
00:17 - I can create a new file right so let me
00:20 - just create a file by clicking on this
00:24 - new file button and then I'm going to
00:27 - name my file as main dot C and then
00:30 - press enter
00:31 - now as soon as I just create a main.c
00:36 - file you are going to see some kind of
00:39 - notification pair Visual Studio code is
00:42 - going to detect that you want to create
00:45 - a CR program and it's going to suggest
00:48 - you to install the related C or C plus
00:51 - plus extensions if it doesn't show any
00:55 - suggestions you can always go to the
00:59 - extension tab so just click on this
01:01 - extensions Tab and then search for C and
01:06 - C plus plus okay so C forward slash C
01:10 - plus plus and once you
01:14 - search for C and C plus plus the top ah
01:18 - extension here is from Microsoft you can
01:20 - see you can just select here this
01:23 - extension and then in your case you are
01:26 - going to see the install option I have
01:28 - already installed this extension in your
01:31 - case you are going to see the install
01:33 - button here so you just need to click on
01:35 - install so this C and C plus plus
01:38 - extension from Microsoft which is the
01:40 - developer for visual studio code
01:43 - is going to run your C or C plus plus
01:47 - program is going to help you to ah debug
01:51 - or browse your C or C plus plus program
01:54 - and it is going to also give the
01:56 - intellisense capability in your C or C
02:00 - plus plus program so just install this
02:02 - and once you have installed this all the
02:06 - features of this extension will be
02:09 - available
02:10 - on your Visual Studio code editor you
02:13 - can also see you have other extensions
02:17 - like C or C plus plus themes here
02:20 - so it is going to look like this so
02:23 - whatever extensions you can see are
02:26 - related to C or C plus plus I will
02:28 - suggest you to install all of them they
02:31 - are going to help you to better run your
02:34 - C or C plus plus programs on Windows
02:38 - operating system in Visual Studio code
02:40 - right now you can see
02:42 - reload is required for this extra
02:45 - extension so I can just click on read
02:48 - load and it's going to uh reload my
02:52 - visual studio code so now let me just go
02:55 - to this Explorer section here where I
02:58 - have created the main.c file I can write
03:02 - a very simple C program here which is
03:06 - going to ask for two numbers and it is
03:08 - going to just add these two numbers and
03:11 - show us the result right this is a very
03:14 - simple program you can find anywhere on
03:17 - the internet
03:18 - now in order to run this program what
03:22 - you can do
03:23 - you can either click on this terminal
03:26 - and open a new terminal and using GCC
03:29 - you can run your C program which is by
03:34 - just using the normal terminal command
03:38 - right you can also
03:41 - create a build task here so you can see
03:44 - there is this ah
03:47 - option called run build task so I'm
03:51 - going to click on this run build task
03:53 - and it's going to give me the suggestion
03:57 - which build task I want to create here
04:00 - it says GCC dot exe because I have
04:04 - created the C file and visual studio
04:08 - code is going to recognize that this is
04:11 - a C file and that's why it's giving us
04:13 - this gcc.exe option so I am going to
04:16 - just click on this
04:17 - which is going to start building my
04:21 - program you can see starting build
04:24 - and you can see the build is successful
04:28 - so my C program has been compiled
04:31 - successfully and you can see main.exe
04:35 - file has been created once the build is
04:38 - complete
04:39 - you can even run this GCC command in
04:44 - your terminal by opening a new terminal
04:48 - so you can click on this plus sign
04:51 - and it's going to open the default
04:53 - command prompt in my case it's
04:55 - Powershell
04:56 - you can even open the command prompt
04:59 - from here so you can see
05:01 - this is the command prompt so you can
05:03 - either use Powershell or command prompt
05:06 - to compile your program also right I
05:10 - have used this inbuilt capability of
05:13 - Visual Studio code to build my program
05:15 - let me show you how you can build the
05:18 - program using the command line also so
05:20 - here I can write GCC dot exe and then I
05:24 - can give the name of my main.c file so
05:27 - let me give the name of my file and then
05:31 - hyphen o and then the name of my output
05:34 - file which will be the executable file
05:37 - so I can name it as main two
05:41 - dot exe file for example right main exe
05:45 - file is already created by this GCC
05:49 - build
05:50 - option so I can create a second exe file
05:53 - and I can run this and you can see this
05:56 - main2.gcc file is created
05:58 - now in order to run these exe files
06:02 - these exe files are the output of your
06:08 - compilation of your C program right
06:11 - so when you want to run your C program
06:15 - you just need to give this command so
06:19 - whatever is the name of your exe file
06:21 - you can give the name of your exe file
06:23 - for example main dot exe file right so I
06:28 - want to run this main.exe file I can
06:31 - just
06:33 - type main.exe and in Powershell it's
06:35 - going to auto complete so I can just
06:37 - type main dot e x c here and then when I
06:41 - press tab it's going to just give dot
06:45 - backslash automatically to your file and
06:48 - then when you press enter it's going to
06:50 - ask me for the first number because my
06:53 - program is asking me to enter the first
06:55 - number and the second number so I am
06:57 - going to enter
06:58 - 2 as the first number 5 as the second
07:01 - number and it's going to show me the sum
07:03 - of these two numbers this is what this
07:06 - program is doing right in command prompt
07:09 - you can just write main dot EXE
07:13 - and then press enter and once again I am
07:16 - going to give the first number and then
07:18 - the second number and it's going to give
07:20 - the sum of these two numbers
07:23 - so
07:25 - main dot C is the file where you write
07:28 - your program and Main dot exe or
07:32 - main2.exe is the output of your program
07:35 - which you can run on the terminal using
07:39 - visual studio code
07:41 - now let's say I want to debug my program
07:43 - how can I do this
07:45 - so I can put a debugger option here so
07:50 - this is called the break point so I can
07:52 - go to any line and I can put the
07:55 - breakpoint on each and every line and
07:59 - when I go to debug option so when I
08:02 - click on debug option I will be able to
08:05 - see all my break points here right so I
08:09 - can see my breakpoint on line 6 and line
08:13 - 9 I can even put the breakpoint on line
08:15 - 12 and it will be added here you can
08:18 - toggle all the breakpoint which means
08:21 - they will be disabled and once you once
08:25 - again toggle they will be enabled
08:27 - you can just remove all the breakpoint
08:30 - using these options so this is how you
08:33 - can add or toggle or remove your
08:36 - breakpoints in order to run your program
08:39 - in debug mode you can click on run and
08:42 - debug and once you click on run and
08:45 - debug you can select your debugger in
08:48 - our case we have installed Min GW which
08:51 - comes with GDB debugger so you can click
08:54 - on C plus plus GDB
08:57 - and once you click on C plus plus GDB
09:00 - you will be able to see this gcc.exe
09:04 - option so I'm going to click on this
09:05 - gcc.exe option
09:07 - and once I click on GCC dot exe option
09:12 - my program is going to run and you can
09:16 - see the debugger has been started and
09:20 - you can see uh when the debugger starts
09:23 - you will be able to see all these
09:25 - options here
09:28 - so you can see at the top
09:31 - this run or continue option step over
09:36 - option then step into option and then
09:39 - step out option so you can see
09:43 - I have created my first breakpoint on
09:46 - line six so the program execution
09:49 - stopped on this line I can now see all
09:54 - the variables or local variables here
09:58 - so you can see in num1 there is a value
10:01 - of 16 which is the garbage value because
10:04 - we haven't assigned any value ah to S if
10:08 - we have assigned for example num is
10:10 - equal to 0 then it will show the zero
10:13 - value if you don't initialize your
10:15 - variables it is going to take some
10:17 - garbage value initially then I can click
10:20 - on step over which is going to go to
10:23 - this ah
10:25 - code where I will be asked to provide a
10:29 - number I can provide a number here for
10:32 - example and then my program execution
10:35 - stopped to the second break point which
10:37 - is this one I can step over I can
10:40 - provide a second number and then press
10:43 - on continue and then my program
10:45 - execution stops at sum is equal to num 1
10:50 - plus num2 so I can just step over once
10:53 - again to the next line and you can see
10:55 - some
10:56 - value is 17 which is the sum of 8 and 9
11:00 - and it's going to print this text when I
11:04 - once I click on continue here you can
11:07 - see the output is printed here
11:10 - so this is how you can use the debugger
11:13 - for the C program on Visual Studio code
