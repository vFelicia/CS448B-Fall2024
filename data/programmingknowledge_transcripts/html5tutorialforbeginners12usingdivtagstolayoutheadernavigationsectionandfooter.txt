00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:04 - in this video we will learn how to use
00:07 - dev element and we are also going to see
00:11 - how we can create a web page design with
00:15 - this dev element in HTML so let's get
00:18 - started first of all what is our dev
00:21 - element our dev element is element which
00:25 - you can use to contain other HTML
00:29 - elements so let's create a div element
00:32 - and let's see how we can use it so just
00:35 - add this dev element and inside this dev
00:38 - element you can use other HTML elements
00:42 - like for example I will use this h1 tag
00:46 - and I will say this is our tutorial and
00:50 - in here you can add a paragraph also so
00:54 - for example this is a paragraph and here
00:58 - you can give the details about the
01:01 - tutorial now if you want to change the
01:03 - style of these two element which is h1
01:06 - and paragraph you can add this style to
01:09 - this div element for example I want to
01:11 - change the background color behind the
01:14 - this h1 and paragraph tag then I can add
01:17 - this style to it so style is equal to
01:20 - background color which is yellow and
01:24 - save your page and refresh your web page
01:27 - it will give the yellow background to
01:30 - your header and the paragraph right so
01:34 - you can use dev element to divide your
01:38 - section of your webpage okay so using
01:41 - this dev element let's create our web
01:44 - page so for example this is my tutorial
01:49 - web page so first div element I created
01:54 - here is the tutorial now second div
01:57 - element I am going to add here is the
02:01 - dev element for creating my navigation
02:05 - bar which contains some tutorial topics
02:09 - for example C++ Java or C sharp now I
02:12 - will add a third
02:13 - their element here which will be the
02:16 - details for the tutorial so I have a
02:20 - devil element inside this development I
02:22 - have a h2 header and the paragraph tag
02:28 - here okay
02:29 - and for the fourth dev element I will
02:32 - just use this copyright message which I
02:36 - want to use it as a footer so I have for
02:40 - dev elements here first was the header
02:44 - div element second is the navigation
02:47 - develoment third is the section and
02:51 - fourth is the footer I will use it as a
02:54 - footer right now what I'm going to do is
02:56 - I'm going to give the ID to every
03:00 - develoment so ID for this header let's
03:03 - say it's header itself and ID for this
03:08 - navigation is navigation and ID for this
03:13 - section is let's say it's section itself
03:16 - and the ID for the footer develoment is
03:18 - foot for example okay so I have given
03:21 - the IDS to each and every development
03:26 - here now I will go to the head here and
03:29 - I will add here a style element so style
03:33 - and inside this style element first of
03:37 - all I will add the style for this header
03:41 - okay so for this header what I am going
03:44 - to do is I am going to use this hash
03:47 - header property of the style so which
03:50 - will reference to this header ID and in
03:55 - here I have given the properties for the
03:57 - background color so background color of
03:59 - this header will be blue then the color
04:02 - will be white which is the foreground
04:06 - color and then the text alignment will
04:10 - be on the center so it will be some
04:12 - somewhere in the center it will be shown
04:15 - at the center okay and the padding for
04:17 - this I have given six pixel now for the
04:21 - navigation let's create a property for
04:24 - the navigation something like this so
04:26 - just
04:26 - add a hash and then navigation and
04:29 - inside these curly braces just add these
04:32 - properties so the first property I have
04:35 - added here is the line height so this
04:39 - will be the height of the side bar and
04:44 - then I have this background color which
04:47 - will be the background color of this
04:49 - navigation bar now the height of this
04:52 - navigation bar is 500 px which is
04:55 - vertical and the width of this
04:59 - navigation bar is 100 px and this is
05:03 - floating to the left so this is
05:05 - important because we want to show our
05:08 - navigation bar to the left something
05:10 - like this right this area okay and I
05:14 - have given it the padding of 5 pixel
05:17 - here now let's add the style for our
05:20 - section ID so for this area let's add
05:25 - the style so just add this style there
05:29 - which is hash section and inside the
05:33 - curly braces just add the width which I
05:36 - have given is equal to 350 pixel and
05:40 - this section is also floating to the
05:42 - left and padding is equal to 10 pixel
05:46 - here okay and for the footer let's give
05:51 - the same width and height as our header
05:55 - so just copy this thing from here and
05:58 - paste it just below here and instead of
06:03 - giving the ID of the header just give
06:06 - here the ID of footer which is foot okay
06:11 - now we need to add one more property
06:13 - here which is called clear:both and what
06:18 - this does is it makes the element drop
06:22 - below your floating element so our
06:25 - navigation and section is our floating
06:28 - element so our footer will be below
06:32 - these floating elements right save your
06:36 - code and refresh it and now you
06:40 - see a header here and you have this
06:44 - section here and you have this
06:46 - navigation bar and you have this nice
06:49 - little photo okay so in this way you can
06:54 - use develoment and you can design your
06:57 - web page using div elements and styles
07:01 - in HTML I hope you've enjoyed this video
