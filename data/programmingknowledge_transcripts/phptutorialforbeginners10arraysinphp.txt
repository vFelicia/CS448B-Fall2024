00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - array in your PHP code so first of all
00:08 - what is an array array is the collection
00:12 - of similar data so for example you want
00:16 - a collection of names you cannot save
00:19 - all the names in a single variable but
00:22 - whenever you use array you will be able
00:24 - to save multiple values of same data
00:29 - type in
00:30 - a single variable so array is a
00:34 - collection of values basically now let's
00:37 - see how we can declare arrays in
00:41 - PHP uh the Declaration is same for array
00:44 - as the variable you just start with your
00:47 - end symbol and for example I want to
00:50 - make an array of
00:52 - names and then you just give this equal
00:56 - to sign and then tell PHP that it's it's
01:00 - an array by
01:02 - keyword
01:04 - array not here
01:10 - but okay and then in these two brackets
01:15 - you give the values to the array okay so
01:19 - for example uh the names can
01:23 - be Mark and uh bear in mind if this is a
01:29 - string data type because names can by
01:32 - Logic are some string data types so just
01:36 - if it's a string data type just include
01:38 - this with in the single quotes as we
01:41 - have seen in the string variables right
01:43 - and second name can
01:46 - be
01:48 - John and third name can be simple
01:54 - name Bob for
01:57 - example and then
02:00 - how for examp okay first of all so you
02:05 - have provided three values in the array
02:09 - now this these uh values you have
02:13 - provided are called elements of the
02:16 - array okay so this is one Element this
02:19 - is second element and this is third
02:21 - element so this is called element of the
02:23 - array now the position of these uh these
02:28 - values or these elements is also
02:30 - important and the position of
02:34 - these values or elements are called key
02:38 - or index and position this key or index
02:42 - starts from zero okay so always always
02:47 - remember that these element key or index
02:51 - starts from zero one and two this is the
02:54 - position at which they are stored in the
02:58 - array now in order to print this what
03:03 - you just need to do is Echo and you can
03:07 - just use your
03:09 - name with of course this and symbol and
03:14 - you can use these square brackets to
03:19 - represent the position which you want to
03:21 - print so this is the zero position first
03:25 - position and second position because
03:26 - index or key starts from zero so for
03:30 - example I want to print the name John I
03:33 - will just Echo names and with a
03:37 - key one right save it and I will just
03:43 - run this and it shows John in a similar
03:47 - way I can print Mark save it and just
03:52 - refresh it it will be Mark or I can just
03:57 - print Bob also
04:00 - okay I will refresh it and you will be
04:02 - able to see
04:04 - for now you can also assign value to the
04:08 - array it's not necessary that you need
04:10 - to only uh you know give the values at
04:14 - the time of initialization of this uh
04:16 - name array you can uh assign these value
04:21 - at run time also or whatever for for
04:24 - example you want to assign some value to
04:27 - the array you can just uh use this name
04:32 - names
04:33 - array and you can
04:38 - assign uh an one more member to this
04:42 - array which will be so we have 0 1 2
04:47 - okay so members till uh key two right
04:52 - you can add the third
04:55 - key and you can add this name for
04:58 - example
05:00 - some random name for example and
05:05 - then uh you can print this
05:08 - here right and what this code is doing
05:12 - is it's just adding Julie to this array
05:17 - right I will save this and I will
05:20 - refresh this and you can see our array
05:24 - is now containing Julie also right now
05:28 - for example you want to print all the
05:30 - values of this array you can do it like
05:33 - this you can use uh a function called
05:37 - print uncore R and it can take the array
05:44 - name like
05:46 - this and what it will do is it will
05:49 - print all the values of your array with
05:53 - their index or key so let's try to
05:57 - refresh it and you see
06:00 - it prints that you have passed an array
06:03 - inside your uh inside your print R
06:06 - function and the index of this name Mark
06:11 - is zero or key of this Mark is
06:14 - zero John Key of John is one key of Bob
06:19 - is two and you can see Julie is also
06:23 - added and the key of Julie
06:25 - is uh three you can add more
06:30 - more values to this by just assigning it
06:36 - a new key and new name
06:43 - okay and then you will be able to see
06:47 - one more key here okay so the key of uh
06:52 - Patrick is four right so this is the
06:56 - basics of array uh in PHP but there are
06:59 - different kind of array in PHP for
07:02 - example associative array or
07:05 - multi-dimensional array which I will be
07:07 - talking in the later videos so that's it
07:11 - for this video I hope you have enjoyed
