00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - this video we will see how to use arrays
00:07 - in JavaScript now first of all what is
00:11 - an array an array is a variable which is
00:15 - capable of storing more than one value
00:19 - okay so using array you can store
00:23 - multiple value in a variable now let's
00:26 - see how we can declare an array in
00:30 - JavaScript so you use VAR to declare an
00:33 - array as any other variable and then the
00:36 - name of a variable for example we want
00:39 - the collection of name or multiple names
00:42 - in a variable and then you use these
00:46 - square bracket to declare them and for
00:49 - example I'm going to add some names here
00:52 - something like this so This array name
00:56 - has four names inside it so it's storing
00:59 - four different names right now to access
01:02 - this array for example you want to
01:05 - access uh the first element of this
01:08 - array how you can do it so what I'm
01:10 - going to do here is I'm going to just uh
01:13 - print this value using document. getet
01:16 - element by ID and I have this uh
01:19 - paragraph tag here whose ID is demo
01:22 - which I'm calling here do inner HTML is
01:26 - equal to and for example I want to print
01:29 - the whole array so I can just call this
01:33 - like this okay and save your code and
01:37 - refresh it and you will see here all the
01:40 - names printed on the web page right so
01:44 - arrays has some indexes and indexes is
01:48 - nothing but the position at which the
01:50 - value is stored and this value starts
01:53 - from zero in the case of array so this
01:57 - position of uh the first value is zero
02:01 - index because the index start from zero
02:03 - so the index of Tom is zero John is one
02:07 - and Bill is two and Mark is three right
02:10 - so for example I want to access this
02:13 - name John so I can just write here name
02:16 - and then in the square bracket one and
02:19 - one is the index here okay and save your
02:22 - code and refresh it it's printing John
02:26 - now for example I want to access this uh
02:28 - name Tom here the index of it is zero
02:32 - okay and just save it and refresh it and
02:35 - then it will give you Tom right so
02:38 - indexes in Array start from zero now if
02:42 - you want to change some item at some
02:44 - index what you can do here is you can
02:47 - just call the name of your array and
02:49 - then the index on which you want to
02:51 - change so for example I want to change
02:54 - this uh name Tom and I want to make this
02:57 - name starting with capital T not with
03:00 - small T so I will just use name zero and
03:05 - then is equal to the new name right so
03:09 - the new name is Tom with the capital T
03:13 - right and let just save your uh code and
03:16 - now refresh it and now you can see the
03:19 - name becomes Tom with capital T right
03:24 - now using this uh method you can also
03:27 - add some items to the array so right now
03:30 - I have four items in my array and the
03:33 - index of uh these items are 0 1 2 3 so I
03:37 - can add at the fourth place an item so I
03:41 - can just write four and in here I can
03:44 - add a new item so something like this
03:48 - and then I can print my array something
03:51 - like this save your code and refresh it
03:54 - and now my array has five items in it
03:58 - now there is one more more way of uh
04:01 - pushing element in the array so for
04:05 - example you want to add one more item in
04:07 - the names so you can use names dot push
04:12 - and then you can just add another new
04:15 - name so for example some new name
04:18 - something like this okay and then save
04:21 - your code and refresh your web page and
04:24 - now you can see one more item is added
04:27 - to your array so you can use push or
04:32 - using this index method to add to an
04:36 - array now there are some method
04:38 - associated with arrays which you can use
04:41 - to use the arrays now for example I want
04:45 - to know how many number of elements are
04:50 - contained inside the array so I can use
04:53 - a method called the length so just use
04:57 - the name of the array which is names in
04:59 - my case case then use Dot and then call
05:02 - length method on it and then it will
05:06 - give you the number of elements inside
05:09 - the array right so save your code and
05:12 - refresh it and it says six which is true
05:16 - because these are four names and these
05:18 - two names we have pushed outside the
05:21 - array right now there is one more method
05:24 - you which you can call on the array
05:27 - which is called sort and this will sort
05:30 - all the element in the array for example
05:33 - you have names here so it will uh sort
05:36 - the names according to the alphabetical
05:40 - order right so save your code and
05:43 - refresh it and now you can see these
05:46 - names are sorted in alphabetical order
05:48 - so B first and then J then M then T
05:53 - right now it's not necessary that array
05:55 - must have the elements of same data
05:58 - types so for for example I want uh
06:01 - strings and integer in my array it's
06:03 - totally valid so for example I'm going
06:06 - to delete this name and instead of this
06:08 - name I'm going to add this integer 500
06:11 - right and save my code and refresh my
06:14 - web page and it's going to add this
06:16 - integer to the array and it's no problem
06:21 - right now there is a different way of
06:24 - declaring an array also and which is
06:27 - something like this so V
06:30 - name one for example is equal to
06:35 - new array and then in the brackets you
06:38 - can provide the elements okay so for
06:41 - example I can just copy this and paste
06:45 - it here and it's totally valid okay and
06:49 - I'm going to declare it above here and
06:52 - I'm going to call this name one here and
06:55 - save it and refresh my web web page and
06:58 - it's going to to give me the same result
07:01 - as we have seen earlier okay now you can
07:03 - use some more examples with arrays for
07:06 - example I will delete this array
07:09 - declaration and uh this also and I will
07:13 - use this uh
07:15 - name and I will call a method called pop
07:19 - okay and what this method does is it
07:22 - removes the last element from the array
07:25 - okay so I will just call this array here
07:29 - and save my code and refresh it and you
07:32 - can see I only have three elements in
07:34 - the array fourth is removed okay now if
07:38 - you want to remove the first element
07:40 - from the array you call a method called
07:43 - shift here okay and it's going to remove
07:46 - the first element from the array so
07:49 - let's save it and uh refresh the web
07:51 - page and now you can see the first
07:54 - element Tom is removed and the second
07:56 - third and fourth elements are here okay
07:59 - okay now if you want to add some element
08:01 - to the first place for example at index
08:05 - 0o you can use unshift method so just
08:09 - write names. unshift and then you can
08:12 - add the value here for
08:15 - example Ben and then save your code and
08:18 - refresh the web page and now you can see
08:21 - at the zeroth index this name is added
08:25 - so in this way you can use arrays in
08:27 - JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this
