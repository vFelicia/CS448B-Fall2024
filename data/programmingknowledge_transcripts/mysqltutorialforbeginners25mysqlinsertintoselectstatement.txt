00:00 - hello friends let's skip the programming
00:01 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:04 - to copy the data from one table to the
00:07 - another Trevor
00:08 - so for this particular operation we are
00:11 - going to use insert into select
00:13 - statement insert into select Testament
00:16 - basically copies data from one table and
00:19 - insert it into the another double
00:21 - now before we use select insert into
00:27 - select statement there are some
00:29 - conditions the first condition is that
00:32 - insert into select requires that data
00:35 - types in source and target table must be
00:38 - match and it is kind of obvious because
00:40 - we cannot copy the data of string type
00:43 - into the table which column has data
00:46 - type of integer and if your target table
00:50 - has already contained some type of 10 it
00:52 - won't get affected okay so let me just
00:56 - open terminal mask you okay so which are
01:12 - the data base that we have so we have
01:15 - data test data base here just use that
01:22 - which are the tables okay so we have to
01:29 - run double and m2 table so which are the
01:35 - records which stops wrong we have roll
01:41 - number which has the type of integer
01:44 - name and Sun and a type of work so let
01:49 - me just create one table create table
01:55 - then name of the table - let us say the
02:02 - first column will be ID the data will be
02:06 - integer
02:07 - the second is name where a data type
02:12 - we provide length let's say 60 the
02:18 - surname working which is also 60 and
02:28 - lastly primary here which will be our ID
02:35 - okay so let me just show you the tables
02:42 - okay so we have created our new table
02:46 - don't look now what we will do we will
02:51 - copy the data from student table and
02:56 - insert into student to table okay so let
03:01 - me just show you which are the records
03:04 - present in stone table okay so these are
03:14 - the records present in our database and
03:21 - now let me just fire the Select query
03:26 - insert into select query insert into now
03:34 - we want to insert into the mutable base
03:37 - in this case student to table which is
03:39 - also called the target table so we write
03:42 - don't - and we want to select data from
03:48 - - on table so select star from student
03:56 - and if you want to provide some
03:59 - condition then we can use like where and
04:03 - then write condition but we don't write
04:06 - any condition here we just want to copy
04:08 - all the records from the current table
04:12 - to the new table okay so as you can see
04:16 - six rows affected now let me select from
04:21 - Scranton
04:23 - and you can see the data is a present in
04:27 - stone table now copied into our new
04:30 - table which is called student to table
04:33 - now there are some various and in insert
04:36 - into select statement I have specified s
04:40 - trick here that means that I want to
04:43 - copy all the columns from the source
04:47 - table to the new table which is stuck at
04:49 - table in this case run to table if you
04:53 - do not want that then you can use column
04:59 - name here if you want to copy particular
05:02 - column from the source table into target
05:05 - happen then you can do that
05:07 - let me just create an open - gilben
05:11 - bench let us see the type of example
05:22 - delete first of all delete start from
05:28 - Toronto sorry
05:33 - delete from Toronto show you okay so
05:49 - okay so I delete all the records to
05:53 - perform the new Kaveri
05:54 - so let me write I want to copy only ID
06:02 - and name I don't want to copy the
06:04 - service
06:04 - okay so insert into Toronto
06:17 - and which are the columns
06:20 - IRD and name select roll number and name
06:33 - from the student table from stir so what
06:44 - I have done here I want to copy on the
06:46 - roll number and name which are present
06:49 - in front table I want to copy a roll
06:52 - number in ID and name into the name of
06:55 - this student to table okay let me just
06:58 - fire this okay and let us see select
07:05 - star from student to as you can see only
07:09 - the ID and name these two columns copied
07:12 - from the source table which don't ever
07:16 - in this new table which is student to
07:18 - table so this is how we can copy data
07:21 - from one table to another thanks for
07:23 - watching
