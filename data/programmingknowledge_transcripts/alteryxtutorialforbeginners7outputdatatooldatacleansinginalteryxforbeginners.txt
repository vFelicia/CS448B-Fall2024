00:00 - in this video we are going to talk about
00:03 - data manipulation and output tool in
00:06 - ultrix
00:08 - so as we know that alteryx is a tool
00:10 - that is used for the purposes of data
00:12 - cleaning as well right so what we are
00:15 - going to do today is actually i'm going
00:18 - to show you how to clean the data
00:21 - if inconsistencies are present using the
00:23 - data manipulation tool in ultrix okay
00:26 - so this is the sample superstore data
00:28 - set that we downloaded and as i have
00:31 - already told you that it is a super
00:33 - clean data set there are no
00:35 - inconsistencies in this data set so what
00:37 - i have done is i have introduced
00:39 - an inconsistency
00:41 - and that is in this furniture
00:44 - what i have done is
00:46 - i have actually added some
00:48 - leading white spaces in this category
00:50 - furniture i have added some leading
00:52 - white spaces now let us add some more in
00:55 - the sub category field okay so there is
00:58 - this chairs i am just going to replace
01:00 - this chairs value
01:04 - and
01:05 - introduce some leading white spaces so
01:07 - around three white spaces would be good
01:10 - and replace all the values of here okay
01:13 - so 791 replacements were made
01:16 - and this is the change that i have done
01:17 - to introduce some inconsistencies into
01:19 - our data set and to see that how can we
01:21 - solve it using ultrex now using control
01:24 - s let me just save this excel file and
01:26 - close this excel file
01:29 - right so let's create a new workflow new
01:31 - workflow 3 over here and uh just
01:35 - import this data set so let's just use
01:38 - this input data and what we are going to
01:41 - do is connect it to a file
01:44 - so this is the data set that we have and
01:47 - the orders sheet click on ok
01:50 - so now um
01:52 - as you can see there is nothing that's
01:54 - been shown over here let's just add a
01:56 - browse tool now there is another way
01:57 - through adding a browse tool that's you
01:59 - can just right click over here
02:01 - and there is this option add browse
02:03 - after and the shortcut for the same is
02:05 - ctrl shift b so you can just add it and
02:07 - click on run
02:09 - now once you do that
02:11 - what would happen is uh you would get
02:13 - this kind of a message and
02:16 - of course the records would be shown
02:18 - over here okay so the profiles had been
02:20 - shown over here now the changes we made
02:22 - were in the category okay so let's just
02:25 - see the category and the subcategory
02:27 - right now
02:28 - the changes were made in the category
02:29 - and the subcategory fields now if you
02:31 - just hover over this category field
02:33 - there are few records
02:35 - that are not okay
02:37 - right the red line is being shown over
02:39 - here and um that is around 21.22 records
02:43 - that are not okay in the category field
02:45 - because the inconsistency is there
02:47 - similarly in the subcategory field as
02:49 - well there is 6.17 records uh 6.17
02:52 - percent records that are not okay
02:54 - represented by red so if you just show
02:57 - the category over here and just split
02:59 - the view
03:01 - so over here we have been shown the
03:03 - category field and here let's just go
03:05 - with the subcategory field
03:07 - so here is the subcategory field okay
03:11 - so now what we get first of all let's
03:12 - take a look at the category field that
03:15 - is 7 000
03:17 - some records are okay but 2121 reports
03:20 - are not okay
03:22 - now what is the reason uh that these
03:24 - records are not okay
03:25 - these are the values with leading white
03:27 - space how many values 2121 values okay
03:31 - similarly if we just talk about the sub
03:33 - category over here
03:35 - so we have
03:36 - 617 records that are not okay
03:38 - represented in the red color
03:41 - and what is the issue the issue is the
03:44 - values with the leading white space so
03:46 - these are some of the inconsistencies
03:47 - that would be shown into your data
03:49 - profile only okay so how do we uh just
03:52 - get rid of these inconsistencies right
03:55 - so what you need to do is search for
03:57 - that particular column over here here as
03:59 - well you can see that the mark of not
04:02 - okay is being shown over here
04:04 - represented by red and the rest is green
04:06 - in category and subcategory fields okay
04:08 - in the output pane and the values that
04:10 - are inconsistent have been marked as red
04:13 - and the message is the cell has leading
04:16 - spaces the cell has leading spaces so
04:18 - whatever the inconsistency is it's been
04:20 - automatically shown to you by ultrix now
04:22 - how do we manipulate it how do we clean
04:25 - it
04:25 - you need to select the column which has
04:27 - inconsistency click on these three dots
04:29 - here we have the option of data cleanse
04:32 - so you can just go to
04:35 - this data cleanse option uh just a
04:37 - second
04:40 - and here we have remove unwanted
04:41 - characters and in the remove unwanted
04:44 - characters the first option is leading
04:46 - slash trailing white space so that means
04:48 - any of the uh leading or the trailing
04:50 - white spaces if there would be removed
04:52 - so just select that option and click on
04:54 - apply
04:55 - now it's going to take a few seconds and
04:58 - the changes would be applied now once
05:00 - the changes have been applied you can
05:02 - see the red mark in the category has
05:03 - gone from here
05:05 - we can see them all correctly the
05:07 - furniture leading spaces have been
05:09 - removed if you want to cross check it
05:11 - let's just bring up the category field
05:12 - once again
05:16 - here
05:18 - so if you see
05:19 - right now okay is change to 100
05:22 - similarly we can do the same thing for
05:24 - the sub category field as well we can go
05:26 - to subcategory data cleanse remove
05:28 - unwanted characters leading trailing
05:30 - white space and click on apply
05:32 - now again it's going to take a few
05:34 - seconds and the changes would be applied
05:39 - in order to crosstrick it you can just
05:41 - go to the subcategory option over here
05:44 - and the okay has been changed to 100
05:47 - now again run the workflow
05:52 - so if you again run the workflow the
05:54 - inconsistencies would be uh introduced
05:56 - once again and why is that because
05:59 - now what we are getting is we are again
06:01 - getting the data from input
06:03 - that means
06:04 - alteryx only makes changes into the
06:06 - format of the data that is brought in
06:07 - front of it not only original files okay
06:10 - so that's why using the browse tool the
06:12 - changes that have been made are only
06:14 - made onto this data that has been used
06:17 - in ultrix right
06:19 - now once we have changed the data what
06:21 - we need to do is actually make use of
06:23 - this data right
06:25 - so what i'm going to do is output this
06:28 - data into an excel file
06:30 - but not on to a single sheet into
06:32 - multiple sheets
06:34 - so how do we do that for this we use the
06:37 - output data tool of this in out category
06:40 - so output data tool let's just bring it
06:42 - up
06:43 - now what i'm going to do with this
06:45 - output data tool is
06:47 - i'm going to select the category as the
06:49 - criteria
06:50 - so what i'm going to do or what i'm
06:53 - planning to do is actually use
06:56 - this category over here
06:58 - to output the data right or basically
07:02 - use a segment to output the data
07:07 - so what would happen is
07:10 - all the data
07:12 - all three
07:14 - separate sheets would be created
07:16 - right so
07:18 - uh if we just apply this segment if you
07:21 - just take a look at the segment field
07:25 - just a second
07:30 - okay so now if we take a look at this
07:32 - segment then what we are getting is that
07:34 - there are three unique values so that
07:36 - means three different sheets would be
07:37 - created in the excel file so for this
07:39 - what we need to do is go to this output
07:41 - tool
07:42 - uh click on this arrow here and go to
07:45 - files and select file so basically we
07:48 - are selecting the location where our
07:49 - file needs to be saved now provide a
07:52 - name for the file let's say
07:53 - output
07:56 - excel okay
07:58 - and make sure that in the save as type
08:02 - it is selected as uh an excel file or a
08:05 - microsoft excel for the extension
08:08 - xls or xlsx
08:10 - because then only you would be able to
08:12 - create multiple sheets in case you
08:14 - decide to save it as an alterex database
08:17 - so multiple sheets in that case is not
08:19 - possible okay
08:20 - click on save
08:22 - now
08:23 - it would ask you to specify the name of
08:25 - a sheet we can just go with sheet1 and
08:27 - click on ok great
08:31 - now what would happen is
08:34 - if you just click on this tool
08:36 - here we have this configuration panel in
08:38 - this you need to just check this option
08:40 - that is take file slash
08:42 - table name from field
08:44 - then there is this drop down from this
08:46 - drop down you have to select the third
08:48 - option which is change file slash table
08:50 - name
08:51 - now what would happen is this would
08:52 - allow you to select the column on the
08:55 - basis of which you want to create
08:56 - different sheets right
08:58 - so
08:59 - uh here we can just use the drop down to
09:01 - select the
09:04 - value and that is the segment so you can
09:05 - just select the segment
09:08 - once you have done all the steps then
09:10 - you need to use this control r or run
09:13 - button to just run the workflow
09:16 - then you can see that the
09:19 - dialog box would be there showing the
09:21 - time taken and if you just click on this
09:23 - messages or that is this three
09:26 - hamburger menu over here you will see
09:28 - that these three sheets were created
09:30 - consumer corporate and the home office
09:32 - sheets and the number of records that
09:34 - were written into each of these sheets
09:37 - to cross check what you can do is go to
09:39 - that particular folder which was present
09:41 - in my desktop here output excel
09:44 - the excel sheet that has been created
09:47 - and you can see that there are three
09:49 - sheets that are available
09:51 - the consumer sheet the corporate sheet
09:53 - and the home office sheet now each of
09:55 - these sheets has their data that is
09:57 - split according to their segments all
09:59 - the home office data in this sheet all
10:01 - the corporate data in this sheet and all
10:02 - the consumer data in this sheet so this
10:04 - is how the output tool in ultrix works
10:08 - the output data tool is used to output
10:10 - the multiple excel sheets that's all for
10:12 - this video thanks for watching
