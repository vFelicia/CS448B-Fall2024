00:00 - hello guys welcome back to the Java
00:02 - tutorial Series so today we are learning
00:04 - Java switch
00:05 - so what is Javascript Java switch
00:07 - statement execute one statement for the
00:10 - multiple conditions okay it's it's you
00:13 - can assume it's like a if else ladder
00:15 - okay statement the statement works for
00:17 - the with byte short integer long enum
00:20 - types and after the Java 7 now you can
00:23 - use string in the switch statement also
00:25 - talking about in other words you can say
00:28 - the switch statement attach the quality
00:30 - of the variable against the multiple
00:32 - values
00:33 - so there are a few points that you need
00:36 - to remember about the switch statement
00:38 - that we will be talking about talking
00:40 - when we get to code about the switch
00:42 - statement okay so let's first see what
00:45 - is the syntax how the switch statement
00:47 - syntax is there okay so first of all you
00:49 - have to write switch and inside circular
00:52 - brackets you can write your expression
00:54 - and then inside that multiple cases are
00:57 - there there are a number of cases you
00:59 - can Define and there is a value is there
01:02 - which is being checked if that value is
01:03 - satisfied then the code inside that case
01:05 - will be get executed and break break is
01:08 - there which is optional you can write or
01:10 - you cannot write you it depends upon you
01:12 - okay and one default statement is there
01:15 - which get executed if all the cases are
01:17 - not matched means uh if let's suppose
01:19 - you have write five cases here okay and
01:22 - none of the values get executed uh for
01:24 - that cases okay then default case should
01:26 - be executed okay
01:28 - so let's understand how the exactly the
01:31 - switch statement flow
01:33 - it is there okay so first of all
01:36 - expression is there which you write and
01:38 - multiple cases here as you can see one
01:40 - two three and uh n number of cases are
01:42 - there and if that case is match then
01:44 - statement one is processed and the and
01:47 - the break break statement is there okay
01:49 - this is optional you can write or you
01:51 - can also not write if you want and one
01:53 - defense default is there if none of the
01:56 - cases is matched then it will get
01:58 - executed okay
01:59 - so let's go in our IDE and let's see how
02:02 - it get implemented okay so I'm here in
02:05 - my IDE let me just create one more Java
02:09 - class
02:10 - so I will name it as switch because we
02:13 - are learning switch right
02:15 - okay just let me increase the font size
02:18 - for you guys and let me get my main
02:21 - method here
02:22 - okay so first thing first I'll give you
02:25 - some basic example okay so let's suppose
02:29 - I have declared an integer variable call
02:32 - number and I will assign it the value 20
02:34 - okay
02:35 - and after that I will Define one switch
02:37 - okay so for Define I will let switch
02:40 - and inside bracket I will give it the
02:44 - way variable number okay pass the
02:46 - variable number and under that inside
02:48 - switch I can define a number of cases as
02:51 - you can see I have as you have till told
02:53 - you okay so I will Define one case where
02:56 - the value of the number should be 10
02:58 - okay so in that case I will just print
03:04 - 10
03:06 - okay and let me just
03:09 - create one more
03:12 - you know one more case
03:14 - so that you can you guys can understand
03:16 - it more
03:19 - more in better way okay
03:23 - let me just get out of this case okay
03:25 - and I will Define another case where
03:27 - value should be 20 and I will again
03:30 - south
03:32 - 20 okay
03:35 - and I will write the break statement
03:37 - okay so here you can Define n number of
03:41 - cases whatever you want okay and after
03:43 - that don't don't forgot to write the
03:46 - default case okay so my default
03:49 - default case should be
03:53 - let's suppose
03:55 - I'm writing
03:59 - not
04:02 - 10 or 20.
04:05 - okay so here I am telling that value of
04:08 - the number is not 10 or 20. okay so
04:10 - that's why the default case is being
04:12 - executed because if the value of k a
04:14 - level of this number variable is 20 then
04:16 - a 20 will be executed if I leave the
04:18 - number is not 20 then this will be get
04:21 - executed okay
04:23 - so I guess that should run okay
04:27 - let me run this
04:30 - and one more thing guys all those
04:31 - resources and code part you will get in
04:33 - the GitHub repository that uh link to
04:36 - that GitHub repository is in the
04:38 - description you can access it okay so
04:40 - here you can see 20 is being printed on
04:42 - the console because the weight value of
04:44 - the number variable is 20 and the number
04:47 - switch is number and the case number two
04:49 - is giving executed as true because the
04:52 - value of the number is 20 and this line
04:54 - is getting printed and break statement
04:55 - will break the flow of the code okay I
04:58 - means it it will get me out of the
05:01 - switch statement and after this switch
05:03 - statement our code is ended okay
05:06 - so let me just give you an another
05:09 - example
05:11 - okay so
05:13 - if I right now
05:16 - see here
05:18 - my value of the number is 30. so what do
05:20 - you think this will default case should
05:22 - be executed right because uh number
05:25 - numbers value is 30 is this is not true
05:28 - this is not true then default case will
05:30 - be in let's see
05:33 - see here not 10 or not or 20 okay so
05:37 - that means uh none of our case being
05:39 - executed as true that's why our default
05:41 - case is executed okay right
05:44 - so I hope you guys have understood the
05:46 - Java switch
05:48 - and try some uh doing some coding
05:51 - questions on Java switch so that you can
05:54 - get the better understanding of the
05:55 - switch and in the upcoming videos I will
05:58 - be talking about the Java Loops okay
06:00 - what are the different types of Loops
06:02 - are there in Java so thank you guys for
06:04 - watching this video I'll meet you in the
06:05 - next one
