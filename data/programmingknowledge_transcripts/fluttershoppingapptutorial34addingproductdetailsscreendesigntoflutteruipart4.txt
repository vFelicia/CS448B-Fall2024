00:00 - we don't need this amber anymore
00:05 - okay sorry we need to make it white
00:07 - actually
00:12 - yeah but now if you see we have a line
00:16 - over here and that is nothing but the
00:18 - elevation of abba so all we need to do
00:21 - is go inside app bar
00:23 - and make the elevation as 0
00:27 - or 0.0 since it is a double
00:31 - yeah so we can see that it all
00:34 - is same and we have it
00:37 - as we had it in the
00:39 - design
00:40 - so that is cool
00:42 - one thing done we can say that
00:45 - okay now this image still looks pretty
00:48 - big to me
00:50 - what i'm gonna do is
00:51 - i am
00:52 - gonna deduct
00:56 - 20 from it let's see
01:02 - okay
01:03 - let's let it be like that we can leave
01:05 - it like that for now so let me add some
01:08 - documentation means
01:10 - basic stuff so that
01:12 - someone else who looks at this code
01:14 - directly and is not watching the video
01:16 - is able to understand
01:18 - so this container
01:20 - is for
01:22 - the background
01:24 - color and this is our
01:28 - main container
01:32 - okay
01:34 - now this is actually adding the
01:38 - curves but that is not important this is
01:41 - important
01:42 - this is the
01:44 - product
01:45 - image
01:46 - actually
01:48 - so
01:48 - that is that now this is the
01:52 - product
01:54 - price
01:56 - per
01:57 - kg
01:59 - okay
02:01 - per kg
02:04 - and it needs to be
02:06 - capital p so over here it is 120 but in
02:10 - the design it is rupees and followed by
02:12 - kg
02:14 - so we can do that since it is already in
02:18 - string interpolation
02:20 - so rupees and then a space then the
02:22 - price
02:25 - and then
02:26 - per
02:27 - kg
02:28 - and let me save this
02:31 - okay so this looks fine
02:33 - now i don't want it in the center i want
02:36 - it in the right so again where is our
02:38 - column yeah so it is over here now i'm
02:40 - gonna make all its child left aligned so
02:43 - that since it is a column the vertical
02:45 - axis is the main axis so i'm gonna write
02:48 - main axis alignment
02:49 - and then from the main axis enum
02:52 - okay i'm gonna
02:54 - write start so let's see if this works
02:56 - or not
02:58 - okay it didn't
03:00 - i don't know why
03:02 - so what we can do is inside the uh
03:05 - surround this
03:07 - text with the widget and that widget can
03:10 - be a sized box
03:13 - okay now the only purpose that sizebox
03:16 - serves is that we can give it a size
03:19 - so i am gonna give it a width
03:22 - and the width is gonna be
03:24 - uh media query
03:27 - dot off
03:28 - context dot
03:30 - size dot
03:33 - width
03:35 - okay
03:36 - so that is there
03:41 - and now you can see it is to the left
03:44 - so what happened over here was that
03:47 - originally uh the text has taken the
03:50 - entire space but now since we
03:53 - surrounded it with a size box the sized
03:55 - box took the entire space and the text
03:58 - inside it only took the space as much as
04:00 - it required so
04:02 - our purpose here is done
04:06 - okay now
04:08 - let's style this text before that i want
04:11 - to leave some space towards the left so
04:14 - what i am gonna do is there are two
04:15 - things that i can do actually over here
04:18 - i can surround this text with a padding
04:21 - okay and that is not
04:23 - the way to go we can simply
04:25 - change the sized box to a container so
04:28 - that we get the width and the
04:31 - padding in the same
04:33 - in the same widget okay so over here i
04:36 - want to add padding and the padding was
04:38 - like edge and sets
04:41 - as in sets
04:43 - only because we only want it from the
04:45 - left
04:46 - and left and i'm gonna give it 50 pixels
04:54 - okay we can
04:56 - this seems fine for now
05:02 - so the warning is also gone now over
05:04 - here in this child text
05:08 - let's start styling it
05:10 - so
05:12 - style and there is this text style
05:15 - now i think the font that we are using
05:19 - is poppins
05:21 - and i think i already have google phones
05:24 - in here
05:25 - let me check yes we have
05:29 - so
05:30 - let me import that
05:32 - import
05:34 - google font dot dot
05:37 - now
05:38 - over here instead of text style it is
05:41 - gonna be google fonts dot
05:45 - pop pins
05:46 - i guess yeah
05:48 - so it is gonna be pop pins
05:50 - and inside this let us give it a color
05:54 - i'm sorry
05:59 - what is that called
06:01 - is it color or text color
06:05 - okay so it is color i don't know why it
06:07 - was not showing
06:09 - over there on its own so we are gonna
06:11 - use the same color
06:14 - okay now if you are asking where if you
06:17 - wanna know where i am getting all these
06:19 - things the design file is in the link so
06:22 - you can go over there and
06:24 - just have a look yourself then after
06:27 - that we need to mention the font size
06:29 - the font size
06:32 - i'm sorry the font size can be
06:37 - 10.0
06:40 - let us refactor it save it and see how
06:42 - it looks
06:44 - and it doesn't look good
06:47 - so what i am gonna do is i am simply
06:49 - gonna pick everything from here so the
06:51 - size is
06:52 - 220 and the
06:55 - font weight is
06:56 - medium so let's simply just do
06:59 - that and see if it looks decent or not
07:03 - and then we will do little bit tweakings
07:05 - ourselves so font size is there
07:08 - and then font weight
07:10 - then again we have the font to 18 mm
07:15 - okay and then
07:18 - the options are
07:22 - bold let's see bold because medium is
07:25 - not an option over here we will have
07:27 - to give 100 200 and values like that
07:32 - so this 120
07:35 - looks fine but i think we can increase
07:37 - its
07:38 - size a little bit more
07:41 - yeah so this looks better okay so with
07:45 - this the
07:46 - price per kg is also done now i'm gonna
07:48 - commit it over here so that
07:51 - if you watch the video or the grit log
07:53 - you will
07:54 - have a good idea
07:56 - so
07:57 - first i'll check the status
08:00 - add all the files to staging then again
08:02 - check if all the files are added and the
08:04 - end green means yes it has
08:06 - then i'm gonna commit it
08:13 - price
08:15 - per kg
08:16 - display
08:18 - and then i'm gonna push it to
08:20 - github
08:25 - okay so this was for the video in the
08:28 - next video we shall add this
08:30 - and most probably the buttons we can't
08:32 - add this for now
08:34 - okay
08:35 - so or maybe we will add this and just
08:38 - add some random data and later on we can
08:40 - connect it with the api so i'll need to
08:43 - think what i need to do but
08:46 - see you in the next video okay so
08:49 - thank you for joining
