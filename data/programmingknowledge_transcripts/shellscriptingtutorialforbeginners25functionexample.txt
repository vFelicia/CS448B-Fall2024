00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in the last two videos we have seen how
00:06 - to use functions in shell scripting now
00:09 - in this video to consolidate our
00:11 - knowledge which we have gained in the
00:13 - last two videos we are going to take an
00:16 - example and then from this example some
00:19 - more concept will be clearer to you so
00:23 - let's start with the example and then we
00:26 - will discuss about the concepts so what
00:29 - we want is we want to check whether a
00:32 - file exists or not using our script
00:36 - so whenever user runs the script with
00:40 - hand argument and this argument will be
00:43 - a name of the file for example and the
00:48 - script will check whether this file
00:49 - exists or not and it will print now this
00:53 - example we have seen in the last videos
00:55 - also but in this video we will use first
01:00 - of all functions and then we will use
01:03 - some more concept so let's get started
01:06 - so let's say our function name is does v
01:11 - exist or is the file exists right so is
01:18 - file exists and then we will just use
01:21 - these brackets and these curly brackets
01:25 - right right now we want to pass an
01:29 - argument so the name of the file we want
01:32 - to pass as an argument so what we are
01:35 - going to do is we will just declare a
01:37 - local variable we can say it's file
01:41 - write a file name you can name it
01:43 - anything and this is a first argument so
01:48 - dollar 1 is the first argument to this
01:51 - function write this we have learned in
01:53 - the last video now we want to check
01:57 - whether this file exists or not so we
02:00 - can use these double square brackets for
02:05 - that right now in the previous video you
02:08 - also know that minus F flag can be used
02:13 - to check whether the given you know file
02:18 - is a really file or a directory or
02:20 - whatever right so now we have this file
02:26 - you know variable which is a local
02:28 - variable which comes from this argument
02:30 - so we will check whether this file is
02:33 - really a file or not so we will just say
02:36 - dollar file and then this will give us
02:41 - true or false right now notice are not
02:44 - giving any if conditions here right I am
02:47 - going to use the return value so this if
02:53 - you are familiar with some other
02:57 - programming language you may know the
03:00 - ternary operations so we are checking
03:03 - whether one operation is true depending
03:06 - upon the you know result if it's true we
03:10 - will return some value otherwise we will
03:12 - return some other value right so we will
03:15 - just use double and operator and then we
03:19 - will return zero I will explain you what
03:23 - I am writing or I will return one okay
03:30 - so let me explain you what's happening
03:32 - with this line so we already know that
03:37 - this can be used to you know check that
03:40 - the file exists or not right so we will
03:43 - either get our true or false or in the
03:46 - terms of this script we will either get
03:49 - 1 or 0 so when in the condition a file
03:53 - exists we will get 1 right now if you
03:58 - know the program flow or how program
04:02 - works whenever we get 1 in the first
04:07 - condition and whenever there is end here
04:10 - so for example there is end and we have
04:14 - the other condition right or so
04:17 - condition to I will just write Co and to
04:21 - write so whenever they
04:24 - is one right so it's true here and when
04:30 - it's true then program flow is not going
04:33 - to check this one or this will directly
04:36 - jumps to the or condition because we
04:41 - just want to see if this condition is
04:44 - true or not right so in the end
04:48 - condition we will check if it's zero
04:51 - then it goes to the next and operator
04:56 - which is this one so it would be zero
04:58 - then it's going to go to the return zero
05:02 - you know operation because here is zero
05:06 - and then if we are not getting one here
05:10 - then program cannot move forward so it's
05:13 - going to check whether the other
05:15 - condition is true or not and so on right
05:19 - but here we know that first condition is
05:22 - already to true so it's going to
05:25 - directly go to the return one condition
05:28 - right and if it's false for example if
05:31 - it's false then it's going to check the
05:34 - second condition which is return true
05:36 - and it gets the written zero here and
05:39 - then it's going to return zero right so
05:42 - in case of file doesn't exist it will be
05:46 - zero and then it going it's going to
05:48 - check the other part of the end
05:51 - operation if it's one it's already got
05:54 - its true value so it's going to go to
05:57 - the next operation which is in the or
06:02 - operation so first of all we will check
06:04 - whether user has given any argument or
06:06 - not with the shell scripting right so we
06:10 - will once again use these double
06:12 - brackets and then if you remember this
06:17 - dollar hashed which is a built-in
06:20 - variable is going to return us the
06:24 - number of arguments number of arguments
06:28 - which are given with the script so this
06:32 - is going to give us the number of
06:33 - argument and if this number of argument
06:37 - is equal
06:38 - zero then we will say we want to do
06:42 - something or we want to show some
06:44 - message to the user so for this I am
06:49 - going to you know create some usage
06:54 - function for example so I'm going to
06:56 - just write usage here and let's create
06:59 - this usage function here for example
07:02 - right so usage and then we will just use
07:07 - this curly brace brackets and this just
07:10 - simply for example print some message
07:13 - and exists so we are going to print for
07:18 - example so we will just echo this
07:21 - message that you need to provide an
07:24 - argument and we will just give the usage
07:27 - of this script also so we need to
07:32 - provide the name of the script and the
07:33 - file name right and if the file name is
07:37 - supplied and argument is for example
07:40 - more than 0 then we will go forward
07:45 - right and then what we are going to do
07:48 - in the next step we will just check so
07:51 - we will use if condition and then we
07:55 - will call this function but let's first
07:58 - give for example then and we want to use
08:01 - else also here so we will write else and
08:05 - then if I to end the condition so we
08:09 - will call this function a file exists we
08:12 - are going to get the true value and then
08:16 - we will print the message so here we
08:19 - will just give the first arguments or
08:22 - dollar one now be eye in mind this is
08:27 - the first argument of this function and
08:30 - this is different this is the first
08:32 - argument which is provided to the script
08:35 - right this is the first argument because
08:39 - it's inside a function this is the first
08:42 - argument provided to the function right
08:44 - and this is the first argument which is
08:47 - provided to the script right so these
08:49 - are two
08:51 - declaration of dollar one are different
08:54 - okay and then if pile exists we will
08:57 - just echo that while is found or file
09:03 - found otherwise we will just print file
09:07 - not found right so let's print file not
09:11 - found
09:13 - okay now let's run the script let's
09:16 - first do Alice here list all the files
09:20 - which are there in my desktop directory
09:22 - so this there is only one file which is
09:25 - the script itself right so let's create
09:29 - one file so I am going to just touch for
09:33 - example file 1 dot txt here okay and
09:39 - then I am going to press ENTER and then
09:42 - I am going to to LS and now I have a
09:45 - file name called file 1 dot txt so I can
09:49 - just run by this my script and then
09:52 - first of all let's not give any argument
09:56 - here we know that we need to give a file
09:59 - name as an argument with the script but
10:02 - let's provide our wrong argument or no
10:05 - argument here and then just press ENTER
10:08 - and then it says you need to provide an
10:12 - argument usage is the script name and
10:16 - then the file name and I also see this
10:20 - message that local command not found
10:23 - because it's spelled wrong so it should
10:26 - be locally not lack law local right so
10:32 - this keyword should be local right so
10:35 - now next attempt we will give the name
10:38 - of the file and then press Enter and now
10:41 - we will see file found so what we have
10:46 - learned from this video from this
10:49 - example two things we have learnt we
10:52 - have already learned how to use
10:54 - functions but we learned that this
10:57 - dollar one and this taller one are
10:59 - different this is for the argument which
11:02 - is provided with this one right
11:05 - with the calling of your scrip and this
11:09 - is the argument which is provided to the
11:11 - function right and we have learned how
11:15 - we can use and and/or operation without
11:19 - the if conditions right you could have
11:23 - used this in different conditions also
11:27 - so you could have you know written if
11:31 - this is this and then return 0 or 1 this
11:35 - could be also done but it can take more
11:38 - number of lines right so if you are not
11:41 - comfortable with this code then you can
11:44 - always switch to if conditions like
11:46 - normal life conditions and then also you
11:49 - can you know get your result ok so I
11:53 - hope you've enjoyed this video please
