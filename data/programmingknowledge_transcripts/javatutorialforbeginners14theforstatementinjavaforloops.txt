00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - how to use four Loops in Java in the
00:10 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:13 - arrays in Java and we will see in this
00:16 - video how we can use for Loop
00:19 - effectively to you know uh use them with
00:25 - arrays so first of all how to declare a
00:30 - for Loop for Loop is same as while loop
00:35 - or do while loop in a way that it
00:38 - execute the same code again and again
00:40 - until some condition is met but in here
00:44 - you have more control over your
00:47 - conditions now let's uh see what is the
00:50 - basic diff uh Declaration of for Loop so
00:52 - you just write the keyword for and then
00:55 - you just
00:57 - write these round brackets and then in
01:00 - curly braces you write your statement
01:03 - and in here you can give three different
01:09 - um Expressions one is
01:12 - called initialization so I will just do
01:17 - it something like this comment in
01:20 - comments uh first of all first
01:23 - expression is called init init or
01:27 - initialization second is your
01:33 - expression and third is called the
01:38 - increment increment value okay so you
01:42 - give these three Expressions inside your
01:45 - for Loop so let's uh try to declare
01:50 - these three expression so inside your
01:52 - for Loop you can Define this integer
01:55 - value for example int I for printing
02:00 - these value for example we can declare
02:02 - the index of uh uh the array like this
02:08 - int
02:09 - index or in the last video if you
02:13 - remember what I have shown you so in the
02:17 - last video I've shown you how to use
02:19 - arrays and how to uh print the elements
02:23 - all the elements of the array using this
02:25 - while loop and we have declared this
02:27 - integer index uh here in the last video
02:32 - this declaration we have done outside
02:35 - our Loop which was y Loop but using for
02:39 - Loop you can initialize this index here
02:43 - itself inside the expression so you can
02:46 - initialize index is equal to zero and
02:49 - then semicolon and then you can check
02:52 - this condition which is index should be
02:55 - less than
02:57 - five we were here so it should should be
03:00 - less than five and then the third
03:03 - condition is the increment we were doing
03:05 - increment like this but in for Loop you
03:09 - can increment this index inside this uh
03:14 - expression value itself so for Loop
03:17 - solves three uh things for you one is
03:22 - initialization which you have done
03:24 - outside whenever you were using while
03:27 - loop and then your expression which is
03:31 - uh which will give you true or false
03:33 - which comes in between and then the
03:36 - increment which we were doing inside
03:39 - your y Loop but you can do it right
03:42 - whenever you are declaring your for Loop
03:46 - okay so in this way you have more
03:49 - control over your code okay and then you
03:54 - can just print the value of uh your
03:57 - array which is this one 1 by one based
04:00 - upon the index so I will run the
04:03 - program and it prints all the values in
04:06 - the array which is
04:08 - 100 31 26 48 and 52 which are these so
04:13 - how it works first of all for Loop
04:17 - initializes your variable for example
04:20 - index is equal to zero and then it
04:24 - checks uh this expression whether value
04:27 - of index is less than five or not so
04:31 - because we have initialized it by zero 0
04:34 - is not is less than zero less than five
04:38 - which is true then
04:41 - it executes your statement and then it
04:45 - increments the value okay so first
04:49 - initialization then expression checking
04:51 - and then if the expression is true it
04:54 - will print your value and then it will
04:57 - increment the value of index by one okay
05:01 - so first the value of index is zero
05:04 - Which is less than five it will print
05:06 - it and the value of array at index Zer
05:10 - is 100 right it print the 100 and then
05:13 - it will increment the value of index by
05:15 - one which is
05:17 - which makes the value of index is equal
05:20 - to 1 0 + 1 is equal 1 and 1 is less than
05:24 - five so it will print the value of array
05:28 - at index one which is 31 and then it
05:32 - will increment the value of index by one
05:34 - now index be becomes two two is less
05:37 - than five it will just print this value
05:40 - again and again
05:41 - right so this is one way of using for
05:45 - Loop but there is one more way of using
05:49 - for Loop and which is like this if you
05:53 - are using specifically arrays then it's
05:57 - more easy to use this this expression
06:00 - for for Loop so the Declaration is the
06:04 - same but in the case of array you can
06:08 - just directly use this array here
06:13 - so for example you can just write
06:17 - int uh
06:22 - element so this
06:25 - is your name of the variable which will
06:30 - hold the value one by one right and then
06:35 - you give this colon here and then you
06:38 - give the name of your array for example
06:42 - like this so what this expression is
06:44 - doing is it will go over your array 1 by
06:48 - one and it will store the value of this
06:54 - array one by one so first at first when
06:57 - this Loop will start the value in the
07:00 - increment or value which will be saved
07:03 - in this element will be 100 and then
07:06 - once again it will Loop and then value
07:09 - becomes 31 here and then value becomes
07:12 - 26 here and then value becom 48 so it
07:15 - will iterate over your array and one by
07:19 - one it will uh transfer the value of uh
07:22 - this array in this element and then you
07:25 - can access this element like this for
07:28 - example you can just uh print
07:31 - this
07:34 - here like this and I will just comment
07:38 - this for now and let's see what happens
07:41 - I'll run the
07:43 - program and it prints the same values
07:47 - like these okay so this is other way of
07:50 - using for Loop if you have arrays to
07:55 - access the values right so here comes
07:58 - the array and it will transfer one by
08:01 - one your element value in this element
08:04 - and then you can access this element one
08:06 - by one whenever Loop will uh iterate
08:10 - over the array okay so this is
08:13 - intelligent way of uh you know iterate
08:17 - over arrays using for Loop and this is
08:21 - basic for Loop which you can use uh to
08:25 - iterate uh over some values so I hope
08:28 - you have UND the basic concept of for
08:30 - Loop and I hope you have enjoyed this
08:32 - video please rate comment and subscribe
08:34 - and bye for now
