00:00 - guys in this video I'm going to show you
00:01 - how you can solve this problem on your
00:04 - code blocks when you try to open the
00:07 - project in the code blocks for example
00:10 - when I click on file and then click on
00:13 - open and then when I open uh project in
00:16 - the code blocks and then click on open
00:20 - my code blocks application quits
00:22 - unexpectedly and I can see this message
00:24 - which says code blocks quit unexpectedly
00:28 - click report to see the D details let's
00:30 - see how we can solve this problem so for
00:32 - now I'm going to click on ignore once
00:35 - again I'm going to open the code blocks
00:37 - here and once code blocks opens before
00:41 - opening my project what I need to do is
00:44 - I need to click on plugins here and then
00:47 - click on manage plugins and there is a
00:50 - plugin called code completion plugin
00:53 - which causes this error so I'm going to
00:55 - select code completion plug-in and then
00:57 - click on disable in front of it so I
01:00 - have disabled this code completion
01:03 - plug-in and once this code completion
01:05 - plugins is disabled I'm going to try to
01:08 - open the project once again so let me
01:11 - just click on file click on open and
01:14 - then click on my project and then click
01:16 - on open once again and this time you
01:19 - will observe that the code blocks
01:22 - doesn't quit unexpectedly and my project
01:25 - is opened so let me just uh click on the
01:28 - main.cpp file here and this is the code
01:33 - which is generated automatically by the
01:36 - code blocks for us so to compile this
01:40 - code I just need to click on this build
01:42 - button so let me click on build button
01:44 - which is going to compile my project and
01:47 - there is no error in it zero error zero
01:50 - warning to run it I'm going to click on
01:52 - this uh Green Run button so when I click
01:55 - on run button says code blocks wants
01:58 - access to control ter terminal yes
02:01 - because we are creating the terminal
02:03 - application code blocks will run this uh
02:07 - C++ program in the terminal so I'm going
02:09 - to click on okay here and it runs the
02:12 - application in the terminal and it will
02:16 - show this kind of uh problem here so
02:19 - when you see uh this kind of problem on
02:23 - your Zs which says no such file or
02:26 - directory on code blogs what you need to
02:29 - do is um let me just close this terminal
02:32 - go to your code blocks and then here
02:36 - click on settings and then click on
02:39 - environment and under terminal to launch
02:42 - the console program instead of this
02:45 - lines so instead of uh this script
02:47 - terminal to launch the console program I
02:50 - need to change this script a little so I
02:52 - need to change it to uh this uh script

03:55 - to work you can see it prints hello
03:57 - world now and everything is working this
04:01 - is how you can download and install code
04:04 - blocks on your Mac operating system I
