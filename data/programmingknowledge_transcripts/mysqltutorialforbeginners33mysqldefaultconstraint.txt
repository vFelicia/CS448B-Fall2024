00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:05 - to use default constraint in your table
00:07 - basically default constraint is used to
00:11 - specify default values for a specific
00:14 - column when this default value will be
00:19 - added to the specific field where no
00:22 - values is explicitly provided to their
00:24 - particular field so let me show you with
00:28 - the help of an example open terminal SQL
00:46 - let me show it's a list of table sorry
00:49 - buta basis here we have the records
00:55 - database a with a see is that okay so
01:02 - let me just create a new table
01:16 - the first one is ID until let's say name
01:25 - where care of size 40 and then come city
01:32 - let's say where care time and now we
01:41 - specify default value by using default
01:44 - keyword default and then we specify the
01:51 - values let's sing
02:11 - okay the center let me show you is a
02:16 - list of tables okay here is our table
02:25 - now let us insert some values okay let
02:35 - me show you select star from here you
02:45 - can see city is Tokyo and we have not
02:49 - specified anybody what if we specify a
02:53 - value
03:08 - as you can see if we specified values
03:12 - explicitly then it will take it and
03:15 - otherwise it will take the default
03:18 - values which is top UN cordis
03:21 - let me just close this let us up on my
03:27 - scale workbench
03:40 - now we are going to answer some other
03:44 - values into default ID and name and it
04:04 - will take Tokyo
04:17 - we can see the values from here
04:20 - right-click on it and select rows as you
04:24 - can see we have not specified any values
04:29 - for sitting and it will take the default
04:32 - value which is stopping so this is how
04:35 - you can use default constraint thanks
04:39 - for watching
