00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - programming knowledge so this is the
00:04 - last part of the five part video
00:05 - tutorial series on how to create a user
00:09 - creation read update and delete
00:12 - application so in this particular video
00:16 - guys we're just going to add the
00:18 - finishing touches for this particular
00:20 - project so the first thing that we're
00:23 - going to add is the user is prompt so
00:26 - say for example we're trying to add
00:28 - users so there should be a display here
00:30 - that says that the user has been added
00:33 - successfully or whenever we have already
00:36 - deleted the subject or to the users then
00:38 - there should be a display also for the
00:43 - the user has been deleted successfully
00:45 - or if there's an error and also if the
00:50 - user has been edited successfully so
00:53 - we're going to all we're going to add
00:55 - all that in this particular video so
00:58 - let's start let's go back to our code
01:00 - editor and try working on with our index
01:03 - that page ok so right about here we need
01:08 - to add all the prompts or all the
01:10 - display if there's an action that has
01:14 - been done in your project so if we added
01:17 - users if we add the users or if we have
01:21 - deleted the users or if there's an error
01:24 - of any actions that we have defined or
01:28 - we have done in our project so the first
01:32 - thing is we need to open up our page
01:34 - attack here and check if the period
01:41 - variable for updated is set so the first
01:46 - event or action that we're going to
01:49 - check there there's an app date so this
01:56 - is this query variable is coming from
01:59 - the form dot PHP so if you try to go
02:02 - here inform dot PHP and we have here
02:06 - after editing or updating the file or
02:09 - the user we're going to redirect the
02:13 - user into
02:13 - next up HP and we're setting up the
02:16 - update that very variable so here we're
02:19 - just trying to check if that particular
02:20 - purely variable is present then we need
02:24 - to display something so echo and then
02:28 - define the dip here let's just close
02:34 - this dip first and add classes to this
02:38 - so class we're going to use the alert
02:44 - coming from deep bootstrap so alert and
02:47 - this alert is of type info and alert it
02:52 - should be dismissible dismissible
02:59 - fade-in shell and the role of this
03:04 - particular element is to alert okay and
03:11 - inside this we need to define a strong
03:15 - message so strong user and update that
03:28 - with success and we need to add a button
03:34 - to our alert so bar on this is actually
03:41 - for closing the under it so button and
03:47 - then we're just going to close this for
03:49 - now and the type of this should be
03:54 - course button and this should have the
03:59 - class of cloves and gate dismiss again
04:10 - guys this is the power after stop
04:12 - technology so if you want to know more
04:14 - about bootstrap technology so we have
04:17 - plenty of tutorials in our channel you
04:20 - can check that out and try to learn this
04:24 - awesome project with
04:26 - traps oh yeah Leoben should be force
04:32 - closed and it should contain also span
04:41 - and close this as well and try to add
04:54 - another attribute it should be inside
05:03 - these fine gentlemen there you go and
05:06 - here is the icon for our close button so
05:12 - times there you go
05:16 - and we'll just try this for now so save
05:21 - index dot PHP and let's try to go to our
05:24 - browser refresh the page and let's go to
05:28 - form that HP by clicking on this record
05:35 - so we have here a error for us so form
05:43 - that page be on line 15 sun-god
05:46 - call to undefined function fetch on line
05:49 - 15 so we're going to try and check if
05:52 - what's the problem with this particular
05:55 - function so for line 15 so there you go
06:03 - row user and we miss the symbol greater
06:09 - than sign and we just need to refresh
06:12 - this okay and say let's go back to our
06:17 - back and refresh so there you go we have
06:23 - the user with IDs ID equals to 7 so the
06:28 - values for name is Jake Nomar and the
06:31 - email is Jake numerous email that comes
06:33 - in so for example we don't like the
06:36 - the last name for this so Jake we're
06:39 - just going to use Jake crank up for now
06:41 - and save so there you go we have the
06:47 - alert that says the user updated with
06:51 - success so we know that our alert
06:54 - function or alert logic is working so
06:59 - we're trying to do the same thing with
07:01 - update I mean a delete in error and also
07:06 - the whenever we have added a new user
07:11 - okay so go back to index that page B and
07:15 - for us to have or first to save time
07:19 - I'll just copy and paste this line for
07:22 - these lines and try to paste it here
07:26 - else if it said deleted so we're just
07:33 - going to change the values also here
07:35 - user diluted with success there you go
07:39 - and of course we need to add another one
07:44 - for inserted else if inserted is defined
07:52 - then this will be inserted with success
07:57 - and another one for error now if you are
08:05 - a query error is defined then it means
08:18 - eebee or database error something like
08:21 - that and try to change this message also
08:25 - so say for example something something
08:31 - went wrong with your action try again so
08:48 - for now let's try this insert that if it
08:52 - will work for us and maybe delete that
08:55 - later on so go back to our and try to
08:59 - refresh the page so insert it straight
09:05 - to add a new user so this will be Jean
09:09 - for James James Jones and email is James
09:17 - Jones at gmail.com there you go and try
09:22 - to save so there you go user inserted
09:25 - with success so we know that the alert
09:29 - for our data insertion is working so
09:35 - another one is for the delete okay so I
09:38 - think we we already have defined the
09:41 - link and as you can see this is working
09:45 - link but we need to add certain logic
09:48 - for this for the deletion of user should
09:51 - work so let's go back to our quota to
09:55 - code editor for now okay so in our index
09:59 - dot PHP we need also to try to delete if
10:05 - the user click on the delete button so
10:09 - if is set the cat variable
10:17 - if get delete ie
10:21 - is set then that means that the user try
10:26 - is trying to delete a certain record
10:29 - from our database so get and of course
10:34 - need to supply the delete ID ID there
10:40 - you go
10:40 - so time catch again the video exception
10:50 - ok so and try to display video exception
10:57 - the message from the exception of course
11:00 - and inside here we're going to check if
11:03 - the user ID is not equal to null because
11:08 - there's no point if the user ID is none
11:13 - there's going our there's no point of
11:17 - deleting it from our user and it will
11:20 - cause errors if the ID is not a first
11:24 - order vs. we're going to check if it is
11:26 - none so if object user delete and of
11:33 - course we need to supply the ID for that
11:35 - and open and close parentheses an object
11:41 - user you need to use the redirect
11:44 - function and redirect to index that PHP
11:48 - but of course we delete that query
11:53 - variable so delete that and before
11:57 - anything else also we need to add a
12:00 - confirmation if we user trying path
12:03 - tries to delete certain record so for
12:09 - now we're going to add a confirmation
12:11 - class for this particular bar and delete
12:13 - so that we can prompt the user if he
12:21 - accidentally clicked on that particular
12:23 - a delete button so class
12:26 - and Confirmation there you go and then
12:30 - we're going to define here the query or
12:34 - J correct information so if the class
12:38 - confirmation and then if the user are I
12:41 - mean the jQuery detects the click on
12:43 - confirmation class then we can return
12:45 - are you sure you want to delete this
12:47 - user and the user has the option to go
12:52 - or continue with this action so say in
12:56 - that's not PHP and try to refresh our
12:58 - page so after refreshing the page I got
13:03 - this error and expect the dollar sign on
13:08 - line 20 so we just need to add a
13:14 - variable name here so should be okay so
13:19 - save that index at PHP and go back to
13:21 - our browser so let's try to delete a
13:24 - record here so I think the second record
13:28 - is good so click on this and a
13:31 - confirmation will be displayed are you
13:33 - sure you want to delete this user and
13:36 - then click on okay so as you can see
13:39 - user deleted with success but I think
13:42 - but I think the user is still there so
13:45 - we're going to check what's wrong with
13:47 - our logic so here we're just going to
13:51 - try and display the ID if there's an ID
13:56 - here so or if the ID is set here so ID
14:02 - for down plus 2 ID and we're going to
14:07 - disable first 30 direct for now so we
14:11 - can see if there's something wrong with
14:13 - our logic so let's go back to our
14:16 - browser refresh the page and click on
14:21 - this and okay so my program expects at
14:27 - least two parameters so as you can see
14:29 - we have an error here user that PHP on
14:33 - line 55 so we'll try to try to figure
14:37 - out what's wrong with line
14:39 - fifty-five so let's go to user dot PHP
14:45 - and on line 55 we need to figure out so
14:50 - here I think we need to make some
14:51 - changes so as you can see my param
14:53 - expects us to have two parameters but we
14:56 - only supplied one which is the ID so we
14:58 - need also to include the placeholder for
15:00 - that and I'll just copy and paste this
15:04 - here and also I've noticed that I
15:08 - misspelled V from keyword of SQL and
15:13 - also I missed the executed okay so I
15:19 - think it should do or it should solve
15:23 - our problem so before that also you need
15:26 - to change the index dot PHP so uncomment
15:28 - this line and remove the VAR down test
15:31 - and let's try to go back to our browser
15:33 - and check to see if now little it is
15:37 - working so refresh the page and try to
15:42 - delete certain record by clicking this
15:44 - icon and okay so there you go user the
15:49 - detail in success and we now only have
15:51 - four records and we can try another one
15:55 - for this click and ok and you can view
16:01 - the information of this also and
16:03 - redirecting to edit dot PHP with all the
16:07 - information included for this particular
16:09 - user and here's all the users from our
16:15 - database so I think that concludes our
16:17 - five-part tutorial series on this
16:19 - particular project so we can now add
16:22 - user we can now read the user we can
16:24 - update and of course we can delete the
16:26 - user so thank you for watching and if
