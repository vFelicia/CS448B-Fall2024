00:01 - hello everyone welcome to ultrix
00:03 - tutorials in this video we are going to
00:05 - talk about two very important tools of
00:08 - the transform tab these are the running
00:10 - total tool and the summarize tool
00:13 - so first of all let's start with the
00:14 - running total tool this tool is present
00:17 - in the transform tab in ultrix
00:20 - and it is used to calculate a cumulative
00:23 - sum on a numeric field per record in a
00:26 - fill
00:27 - it can also be used to create sums of
00:29 - groups of records and calculate the
00:31 - cumulative sums of multiple fields
00:34 - at the record or even at the group level
00:37 - so
00:38 - let us understand the usage of this
00:40 - running total tool with the help of an
00:41 - example right so let me just first get
00:44 - my data using this input data tool which
00:47 - is present in the in out tab
00:49 - now let's just click on this drop down
00:51 - and get our excel sheet which is the
00:54 - consumer sheet click on ok
00:57 - now let's just grab this running total
00:58 - tool and bring it over here
01:01 - here we have two options that are
01:03 - present in this running total tool
01:06 - in the configuration panel that is the
01:07 - group by field which is again optional
01:10 - and the second option is the create
01:12 - running total field
01:13 - so it helps us to create the numeric
01:16 - fields to create a running total
01:18 - basically to select the fields through
01:20 - which we want to create a running total
01:22 - in your database there might be
01:23 - different kinds of fields like the
01:25 - textual fields the date fields
01:28 - or spatial object fields but the running
01:30 - total tool will automatically fetch out
01:33 - the numerical fields and would give you
01:34 - only those fields on which it is
01:36 - applicable right so these are all the
01:38 - numeric fields that are present in my
01:40 - data set that's why it's showing the
01:42 - list of all of them right
01:44 - now
01:44 - uh what you want is you can just select
01:47 - the fields
01:49 - of whose running total you want
01:51 - the new columns would be created and
01:53 - they would be added with a run total
01:56 - underscore prefix
01:58 - to
01:58 - show that this was the original record
02:00 - and this is the total that has been
02:02 - calculated by this particular tool
02:04 - so
02:05 - let's just see how it is going to work i
02:07 - want the
02:09 - total of sales quantity discount and
02:11 - profit these are the four values whose
02:13 - total i want
02:16 - next what i can do is i can click on run
02:18 - and wait for a few seconds till it has
02:20 - finished running
02:22 - this is how it's looking
02:32 - if i just click on this output tab
02:34 - over here or using this anchor
02:37 - then i would be getting these
02:40 - four columns running total underscore
02:42 - sales quantity discount and profit
02:45 - this means that this is the total values
02:48 - that have been calculated by this
02:50 - particular tool
02:51 - if you go to the very last record you
02:53 - would be of course getting the highest
02:55 - value or the total value of the sales
02:57 - quantity discount and profit if you take
03:00 - a look on the profit values then there
03:02 - is a point where these values are in
03:03 - negatives which means i'm not getting a
03:05 - total profit i am getting some of the
03:07 - loss from my sales
03:09 - but slowly if you see the values have
03:11 - again
03:13 - converted them into the positives that
03:15 - means the total value is a profit or a
03:16 - loss that would be getting for the last
03:18 - record
03:20 - so this is how the running total uh tool
03:22 - works it is actually used to give you a
03:24 - summary of the numeric fields that i've
03:26 - been working on
03:29 - next we have is the summarize tool now
03:31 - this is a really important tool in
03:33 - ultrix and we are going to
03:36 - use it often whenever we are developing
03:38 - the workflows so let us understand it's
03:40 - working first of all
03:42 - it is used to perform the various
03:44 - actions which could be the functions or
03:46 - the calculations on the data
03:48 - it can like return the sum of the column
03:52 - for the data
03:54 - which is
03:55 - basically calculated by adding all the
03:57 - rows in the column
03:59 - it can return the minimum or the maximum
04:01 - value in the column it can count the
04:02 - number of rows it can group the column
04:05 - of a data by identical values it can
04:07 - concatenate the string values it can
04:08 - perform a variety of mathematical
04:10 - calculations and even perform spatial
04:13 - object processing
04:15 - now uh these are
04:17 - a variety of steps that are really
04:19 - important whenever we are working with a
04:21 - workflow right so let's just see some of
04:24 - the actions one by one to understand it
04:27 - let's me just grab my summarize tool and
04:29 - connect it
04:31 - connect my database
04:33 - the database here i'm using is the excel
04:35 - sheet for the consumer segment okay
04:38 - now here we have two things the fields
04:40 - and the actions
04:41 - the fields is basically the data fields
04:44 - that has been taken from the input data
04:46 - set
04:47 - along with its data type okay
04:51 - now what we can do is we can just select
04:53 - some of the fields and if you want to
04:55 - select multiple fields you can just
04:56 - shift and click on them
04:58 - [Music]
05:02 - like this okay
05:03 - or what you can do is control click them
05:07 - to select multiple
05:08 - fields um then we have is a select
05:12 - option which has different options like
05:15 - all which means it would select all the
05:17 - fields none it would deselect all the
05:18 - fields numeric it would select only the
05:21 - fields with the numeric data type string
05:23 - would select only the string fields and
05:25 - spatial would select only the fields
05:27 - with the spatial data types right
05:30 - so these are the kinds of options that
05:31 - we could perform let me just select the
05:33 - numeric fields so you can see the row id
05:35 - sales quantity discount and profit have
05:37 - been selected
05:39 - next uh what we need to do is once you
05:41 - have selected the fields we come to this
05:43 - add option
05:45 - so uh this ad option is actually used to
05:47 - so just search for the action that we
05:49 - need to perform you just click on it
05:52 - here are the different options that
05:54 - could be performed we can find the
05:55 - minimum value the maximum value the sum
05:58 - count count non null count distinct
06:00 - count distinct normal count null
06:03 - group by first last and these are the
06:05 - number of the functions that could be
06:07 - applied like numeric functions string
06:10 - functions
06:11 - uh spatial functions behavioral analysis
06:13 - and the report functions okay
06:15 - so if we just go to the numeric
06:17 - functions uh here is the number of the
06:19 - functions that could be applied like
06:21 - average percentile median and mode
06:24 - so what i'm going to do is i'm just
06:25 - going to select none and i'm going to
06:27 - show you the different functions that
06:29 - could be applied for each of the data
06:31 - types that is double string
06:33 - and we don't have spatial data so let me
06:35 - just go with numeric and the string
06:37 - values only okay so first of all let's
06:38 - just select these four
06:41 - i'm ignoring the row id because that's
06:43 - no need for that
06:44 - next what we can do is just go to this
06:46 - numeric fields and here select the
06:48 - percentile
06:51 - now
06:52 - in the action field we have the fields
06:54 - the action cell could be performed and
06:55 - what would be the name of the output
06:56 - field if you want to change the name of
06:58 - the output field that you can do if you
06:59 - want to change the action that also you
07:00 - can do for example in the case of sales
07:03 - i want the
07:05 - max value
07:06 - in the case of quantity i want the
07:08 - percentile
07:09 - in the case of discount
07:11 - or in the case of discount i want
07:13 - percentile in the quantity again i want
07:14 - the minimum value
07:17 - and in the case of profit i want the sum
07:20 - okay so these are the four different
07:22 - actions that i want to perform on the
07:24 - different fields
07:25 - and once you have selected all of these
07:27 - things you can just simply click on run
07:30 - and wait for a few seconds let's just go
07:32 - to the output so it is giving me the
07:34 - maximum value of the sales
07:36 - the minimum quantity that was purchased
07:38 - was one the percentile discount is 0.2
07:41 - percent and the total sum of the profit
07:44 - that i have taken is this much of the
07:46 - profit okay
07:49 - uh now
07:51 - the names of the columns have been named
07:53 - accordingly which means you can
07:55 - understand that what's what is going on
07:58 - in these right
08:00 - so this is for the numeric values let me
08:02 - just copy this
08:05 - create a new workflow to show some of
08:07 - the functions for the string values as
08:08 - well okay here i can just paste them and
08:12 - for this
08:13 - tool i'm just going to make the changes
08:16 - by selecting the string values
08:19 - and what are
08:20 - those things that i could add is count
08:23 - null count not null so let me just give
08:25 - go with the count
08:28 - if you want to delete any of these
08:30 - actions you can just simply select that
08:31 - action and click on minus select that
08:33 - action click on minus okay
08:35 - so this is what i am going to go with
08:37 - that is the count in the case of
08:39 - category i want count distinct in the
08:41 - case of category a subcategory also i
08:44 - want to count distinct
08:45 - in the case of segment i want
08:48 - count non-null
08:51 - in the case of country i want count null
08:54 - and so on okay
08:56 - i have created a bunch of different
08:58 - actions
08:59 - uh in the case of customer id
09:03 - i want the longest okay
09:05 - now once i have selected all these
09:07 - operations i can click on run
09:11 - so it's going to take a few seconds and
09:14 - let us just go to this output to select
09:16 - the uh to just see the values so first
09:19 - of all is count that would give me the
09:20 - count of order id next is count two that
09:23 - is giving me the count of the ship mode
09:24 - which is actually the total number of
09:26 - the records
09:27 - next is the longest customer id then the
09:30 - customer name uh customer segment
09:33 - then count of the null in the country is
09:35 - zero that means there are no null values
09:36 - right similarly for the count distinct
09:39 - category there are three distinct
09:40 - categories that's why it's giving me the
09:42 - result as uh three
09:44 - similarly in the case of subcategory it
09:46 - is counting it as 17 that are 17
09:49 - distinct subcategories are present
09:52 - and finally we have the count of the
09:54 - product name so there are
09:56 - 5191 products that are available that
09:59 - means
10:00 - everyone has purchased some products
10:02 - so this is how the summarize tool works
10:05 - in the transform tab
10:07 - that's all for this video
10:09 - that's all for the tools for the
10:10 - transform tab
10:12 - and thanks for watching
