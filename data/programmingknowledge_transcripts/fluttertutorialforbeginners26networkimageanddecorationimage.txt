00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so in
00:03 - this video we will come back to flutter
00:05 - from Dart and continue our discussion
00:07 - where we left so in our last flutter
00:11 - video that we discussed about image dot
00:14 - asset so in this video we are going to
00:17 - discuss about another type of image and
00:20 - that is image dot network okay so what
00:24 - it basically means is that you can
00:26 - display any image from the internet in
00:29 - your flutter application okay so for
00:32 - that I will remove this child completely
00:35 - from here
00:36 - add another child and that is image dot
00:41 - network okay and then we need to give
00:45 - SRC which is actually the URL of the
00:50 - image okay so I have a URL copied you
00:55 - can pick any URL from the Internet okay
01:00 - now if I save this I should be able to
01:03 - see this image on my screen and you can
01:07 - see this it is a simple image of a per
01:10 - girl with a red background okay so now
01:14 - the properties that we discussed in
01:17 - image dot assets are also applicable in
01:20 - image dot network and there are a few
01:22 - more things which were there which were
01:25 - present in image asset but I have
01:28 - intentionally left that to discuss in
01:30 - image dot network because it makes more
01:33 - sense over here okay so for that first
01:36 - or quick recapitulation about frame
01:39 - builder so as I - as we discussed in our
01:42 - previous video frame builder takes four
01:45 - properties first is built context
01:50 - context then widget child then frame and
02:06 - loaded okay and then it needs to return
02:10 - of a chat okay so just to see the
02:15 - difference of this frame meter I'll
02:17 - simply add up padding okay and it will
02:23 - have a padding of lexicons heading sets
02:29 - I'm sorry
02:33 - edging sets all and let's say 20 points
02:38 - zero and the child is our child with jet
02:43 - over here so now I'll format this and
02:51 - and let us see the difference okay so
02:56 - now you can see we have a padding of 20
02:59 - from all the sides okay let's make it 40
03:02 - so that the change is significant and
03:07 - you can see we have spacing from all the
03:10 - sides and that is top padding okay so
03:14 - this is about frame builder we have
03:16 - discussed it in the previous video about
03:18 - image dot asset now the next thing that
03:21 - we are going to discuss is a loading
03:25 - builder okay so the reason I have not
03:27 - discussed it in image dot asset because
03:30 - over there we don't actually load
03:32 - something we already have the image in
03:34 - our asset folder but while we are
03:37 - loading some image from network which
03:39 - means we are the downloading stuff from
03:43 - some other server so that might take
03:45 - some time to load okay so that is when
03:48 - we use the loading builder
03:51 - okay so then loading builder also takes
03:54 - build context I'll call it
04:01 - context and then a widget child and then
04:09 - image chunk I'm sorry
04:15 - image chunk event and that is the
04:21 - loading progress okay so this has all
04:25 - the data about the loading speed bytes
04:28 - already loaded and bytes remaining to
04:31 - load means all the numerical data means
04:34 - are stored in this image chunk event
04:38 - okay so we can get all the data from
04:41 - this loading process okay anyways we are
04:43 - not going to discuss anything about that
04:45 - right now because that is not actually
04:48 - used that much okay so now over here we
04:52 - want to return a widget and that widget
04:54 - will be displayed until the image is
04:56 - being loaded from the server okay so for
05:00 - that I will simply return inside our
05:04 - Center inside the center I will have a
05:10 - child and that will be our textview
05:13 - okay and the textview says loading image
05:25 - okay and why is this text we're giving
05:28 - another okay so it should be a text not
05:31 - a text view I'm sorry
05:35 - now let's run this and see okay so you
05:39 - can see after some time the images
05:42 - loaded okay now the next thing that I
05:45 - want to discuss is error builder so that
05:49 - means that this widget will be displayed
05:52 - when there is an error the widget that
05:54 - we returned in error builder okay so
05:57 - error builder it also takes build
06:00 - context you will see in flutter whenever
06:03 - we are returning our with yet we are
06:05 - generally taking a bit context then an
06:11 - error object
06:13 - sorry object spilling snow and then a
06:21 - stack trace
06:30 - about error again then over here I will
06:37 - built on inside our Center the child
06:43 - will be next error of cord okay so now
06:54 - let's return this let's run this and
06:57 - before running I will remove just one
07:00 - letter from here so that this URL is
07:02 - invalid and this error builder should be
07:05 - called okay so let's see
07:15 - and you can see error occurred is
07:18 - written in the center and along with
07:19 - this you can also see in the terminal we
07:22 - are not getting any errors when which
07:25 - would be in the console if we don't have
07:29 - this thing right over here okay so let's
07:33 - say if I remove this error builder and
07:36 - then if I try loading invalid URL we
07:41 - will get error and over here in our
07:43 - console and you can see that and even on
07:47 - the screen so that means that the error
07:51 - handling has also been done internally
07:53 - when we use a error filter okay so that
08:00 - was about image network and all the
08:03 - other things that were discussed in
08:05 - image dot asset is also applicable in
08:07 - image dot network this were a few new
08:09 - things okay so now these are not the
08:13 - only types of images that we have in
08:16 - flutter there are two more that is image
08:19 - dot file and image dot memory okay so we
08:25 - will discuss about those when we cover
08:28 - little bit more about basics like
08:31 - working with files in flutter and
08:33 - working with base64 and stuff like that
08:37 - okay so this was about image dot network
08:42 - and now since we are discussing images
08:45 - there is another way to display a image
08:48 - inside a container okay and that is
08:51 - inside a decoration so inside a
08:53 - decoration we have our simple box for
08:55 - decoration okay now this box decoration
08:59 - has a property image and this image
09:04 - takes our decoration image with it okay
09:07 - so over here I will write the decoration
09:09 - image and then inside the decoration
09:13 - image images required part okay and then
09:16 - over here we simply can't write the URL
09:20 - for network image or the path for asset
09:23 - image okay for that
09:25 - here we have different with jet suppose
09:28 - if I want to display a asset image so I
09:31 - write asset image that is the widget
09:35 - name and then over here the first thing
09:37 - should be the path so that is asset and
09:42 - then we shove dot PNG now let's run this
09:47 - and see and you can see the images over
09:53 - here now what will happen if we will
09:55 - apply padding to this container that
09:58 - will not be applicable for this image
10:01 - because this images are decoration to
10:04 - the container and not top child to the
10:07 - container okay so there's a difference
10:10 - between decoration and child
10:12 - okay now similarly for our network image
10:17 - we have Network event and then over here
10:21 - goes the URL okay so you can add the URL
10:25 - over here and then it will be pretty
10:28 - much the same we will be able to see the
10:31 - image on the screen okay and now we
10:35 - apply all the properties to the image
10:39 - like freight and stuff so that is not
10:43 - inside this asset image that is inside
10:46 - this decoration image okay so over here
10:49 - I can have that fit and then all the
10:52 - other stuff that I had in image to a
10:55 - certain image dot Network not all but
10:58 - most of them this is suppose if I write
11:02 - fit height and let's see what happens
11:05 - and for matrix save it
11:10 - and you can see the same properties as
11:12 - we discussed in image stored asset okay
11:15 - so this was yet another way how to
11:17 - display eye image in flutter ok the pro
11:21 - method you display an image may vary
11:22 - according to your needs so this was for
11:26 - the video
11:26 - thank you
