00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in our previous video we saw
00:05 - that how to select specific columns from
00:08 - a table using a select statement and in
00:11 - this video we will see that how to
00:14 - select column specific column by a
00:17 - select statement but in this scenario we
00:20 - only wanted distinct values so first of
00:24 - all let us see how to do it in a
00:26 - terminal so first open your terminal my
00:33 - skill I knew until provide password now
00:47 - let us see which are the databases that
00:50 - we have so we have data test databases
00:56 - that we have created so just use that
01:05 - now show tables student table and just
01:15 - so you get a force
01:22 - [Music]
01:32 - okay so we have this record and let me
01:38 - insert some water God answered seven to
01:54 - [Music]
01:58 - ten times LS
02:26 - okay no no here you can observe one
02:32 - thing that whenever we fire this Kaveri
02:36 - select star from student oh let me just
02:39 - fire anything very silly name here you
02:54 - can see region is displaying two x
02:59 - concepts plane two x + LX is also
03:02 - displaying two x so because if it
03:08 - sources the multiple values but we want
03:13 - we don't want that we want only distinct
03:16 - values no matter how many times it
03:19 - present in the database we want my SQL
03:23 - server to saw it only one time okay so
03:27 - in this scenario we can use select
03:34 - distinct and then name of the column
03:45 - here you can see though there are two
03:51 - breezin present in the database - L X as
03:54 - well as - corn but because of this
03:59 - distinct keyword that we have used here
04:01 - region is saying only one time LX and so
04:04 - on so let me just close it and open open
04:15 - - color match yeah
04:21 - first we write select name from student
04:36 - and Phi this query so here you can see
04:40 - there are duplications in the values as
04:44 - is out earlier if we want distinct value
04:50 - and you just need to type distinct
04:53 - keyword here you can see let me provide
05:13 - in here then you can see region
05:27 - brie chain corn is appearing also two
05:30 - times this is happening because in the
05:34 - surname field there are no duplications
05:37 - they are unique values for each name
05:43 - that we have inserted in our table so
05:47 - that's why it displaying all the values
05:55 - again it's also a distinct value so this
06:00 - is a you can select distinct value from
06:03 - your table that is one thing that you
06:07 - need to remember is that you cannot
06:11 - write this thing keyword anywhere you
06:13 - want in between this leg statement let
06:16 - me show you select now ID and then you
06:24 - specify distinct
06:30 - [Music]
06:35 - here you can see it gives an error mmm
06:43 - you cannot tell the mask when there you
06:49 - want all the IDS but you want only
06:51 - distinct name then how it can manage to
06:54 - show in it in the table format so you
06:58 - have to specify the distinct giver in
07:05 - the first place okay thanks for watching
07:13 - it
07:22 - you
