00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Jenkins - told for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how to
00:06 - restrict Jenkins project access to the
00:09 - users and group using rolls now this
00:13 - video will be the continuation of the
00:15 - last video in which I have shown you how
00:17 - to install the plugins in chenkin and we
00:21 - have installed the special plugin to
00:23 - restrict the project access to the user
00:26 - which was role based authentication
00:28 - strategy plugin so you can see in manage
00:32 - Jenkins when you go to the manage
00:34 - plugins and then you will go to the
00:38 - installed section here and you can
00:41 - search for role here and if you have in
00:45 - your installed section this plugin which
00:48 - is role based authentication strategy
00:50 - then this video will be beneficial to
00:53 - you otherwise you need to install this
00:55 - plugin so once you have this plugin
00:58 - installed let's start using this plug-in
01:01 - to restrict the project access to the
01:04 - user so once again I'm going to go to
01:06 - the manage Jenkins and first of all let
01:10 - me create some users so that we can
01:13 - restrict the project access to them so
01:16 - I'm going to go to the manage users
01:18 - first of all so right now I have admin
01:22 - user and I have one more user which is
01:24 - user dot one let me create some more
01:28 - users so I'm going to create user dot
01:31 - two and then the password for user two
01:36 - and the full name I'm going to just
01:39 - leave it as same user dot two and the
01:42 - email address and then create user and
01:46 - I'm going to create one more user user
01:49 - three and the password and the full name
01:51 - user dot three same I will leave it as
01:54 - default and then the email ID so now we
01:59 - have three users user dot one user dot
02:02 - two and user dot three now let's go to
02:06 - the manage Jenkins once again and this
02:10 - time just go to the section called
02:13 - global security and once you are in
02:16 - configure global security section make
02:18 - sure that this option is already checked
02:21 - which is enable security and then just
02:24 - scroll down and in the authentication
02:27 - section you will see a new option here
02:31 - which is rule-based strategy this will
02:33 - appear after the installation of the
02:36 - plug-in which was role based
02:37 - authentication strategy so we are going
02:40 - to check this option and then save it so
02:45 - once you have checked the option role
02:47 - based strategy in configure global
02:50 - security when you will scroll down now
02:53 - you will see a new option which is
02:55 - manage and assign roles so I'm going to
02:58 - just click on this option which says
03:00 - manage and assign roles and here we have
03:04 - three options
03:05 - manage roles assign roles and role
03:08 - strategy macros so I'm going to go to
03:10 - the first section here and here you will
03:13 - see the global roles global rules are
03:16 - the rules which are globally configured
03:19 - for example admin is a global role let's
03:22 - create a new global role for example
03:25 - employee is a global role we will just
03:29 - add it and for employees we just want to
03:31 - give the overall read access to the
03:34 - global role employee and we want to give
03:38 - the view access to the employee role and
03:42 - all other access we don't want to give
03:45 - for example credentials or agent
03:47 - creation or job creation for the
03:50 - employees for now I'm not giving any
03:53 - access to the employee role now when I
03:57 - scroll down a little you will see
04:00 - project roles so under this project
04:01 - roles section you can provide the
04:04 - project-based roles and authentication
04:08 - so for example we have a Java developer
04:11 - role so I'm going to just write Java
04:13 - - developer and in the pattern you can
04:17 - provide the access of the Jenkins job
04:21 - based upon this pattern - the Java
04:23 - developer for examples so let's say any
04:25 - project which start with
04:27 - the keyboard Java is accessible to this
04:31 - role Java developer so I'm going to just
04:33 - write the pattern of that which is Java
04:36 - dot Asterix this means that any name any
04:42 - Jenkins job name which starts with Java
04:45 - will be accessible to this role which is
04:47 - Java developer so I'm going to add this
04:50 - role and I'm going to provide all the
04:54 - access for this Jenkins job to the Java
04:59 - developer so now the Java developer role
05:03 - is created let's create one more role
05:07 - which is for example we have intern in
05:11 - our team so I'm going to just write
05:13 - intern and in turn will have the access
05:17 - to the projects which start with hello
05:21 - so all the project which starts with
05:23 - hello intern will have the access to
05:26 - only those projects I'm going to just
05:29 - give the access to the role intern now
05:33 - let's add one more project role here for
05:35 - example tester so the tester will have
05:40 - only the access of the project whose
05:44 - name start with test for example ok so
05:49 - I'm going to just add this tester role
05:51 - and then I will provide the access to
05:55 - these type of project to the tester so
05:58 - once these roles are created and you
06:00 - have given all the access for this
06:02 - project to the roles then you can save
06:07 - your configurations and we will verify
06:10 - this configuration by just going again
06:13 - to the manage roll section and you can
06:15 - see employee role is there and our three
06:19 - project roles are there also which will
06:21 - have the access to these kind of
06:24 - patterns now I will just come out I will
06:28 - just click on manage and assign roles
06:30 - once again and this time I will go to
06:33 - the assign roles section and in here in
06:37 - the global roles we only have
06:39 - user admin here so we will add some more
06:42 - users here for example user dot 1 is the
06:47 - first user we will add and then user dot
06:51 - 2 is the second user and user dot 3 is
06:57 - the third user and let's say all of them
07:01 - are employees so the global role we are
07:04 - assigning to user 1 user 2 and user tree
07:07 - is employees so none of them have the
07:10 - admin role now I will scroll down and
07:14 - here under item roles I will once again
07:17 - add the users first of all so user dot
07:21 - one and then use a dot two and user dot
07:28 - three now let's say user one is a Java
07:32 - developer user two is an intern and user
07:36 - three is a tester so I will just check
07:39 - the roles which is belonging to the user
07:42 - and then I will save this configuration
07:45 - once again and I will verify this by
07:48 - just going again into the assign roles
07:50 - and you can see user 1 user 2 and user 3
07:55 - have the employee global role and user 1
07:58 - is a Java developer user 3 is a tester
08:02 - and user 2 is an intern now once you
08:06 - have done that I will just go to my
08:10 - Jenkins home page and you can see I'm
08:12 - logged in as an admin so I can see every
08:17 - project here and when I log out here and
08:20 - I will just log in with user 1
08:23 - credential and I'm going to log in and
08:26 - you can see user 1 was a Java developer
08:30 - so user 1 can only see the project we
08:33 - start with the keyword Java so Java
08:37 - HelloWorld and Java job I'm going to log
08:41 - out and now I'm going to log in with the
08:46 - user to credentials so user dot 2 and
08:49 - the password and login and you can see
08:52 - you
08:52 - - was an intern right so user two will
08:55 - have access to all the Jenkins job which
08:58 - start with the keyword hello
09:00 - so hello world build the world message
09:03 - hello world run and let's see what
09:07 - project does use a three half so user
09:11 - dot tree and then I'm going to login
09:13 - with his credentials and user three
09:15 - doesn't have any project because we
09:19 - don't have any Jenkins job related to
09:22 - the tester so when I login with the
09:26 - admin credentials you can see there is
09:29 - no Jenkins job which start with the
09:31 - keyword test so let's create one Jenkins
09:35 - job so I'm going to just click on new
09:37 - item and I'm going to just say test
09:41 - project one okay so test project one and
09:46 - it will be a freestyle project and I'm
09:50 - going to just click OK and in the
09:52 - configuration I will leave this
09:53 - configuration as blank because we just
09:56 - want to test this champions job if you
09:59 - use a three has the access to this
10:01 - Jenkins job or not so I'm going to just
10:03 - save this Jenkins job and I will go to
10:06 - the home page once again so now we can
10:09 - see we have one new Jenkins job it start
10:12 - with the keyword test so I'm going to
10:15 - log out once again and I'm going to log
10:18 - in with the user 3 credentials and now
10:22 - you can see user tree have the access to
10:26 - the project which start with the keyword
10:29 - test so in this way you can use the role
10:32 - based authentication strategy plug-in
10:35 - and in this way you can restrict the
10:38 - Jenkins project access to the users and
10:42 - group using their rules so I hope you
