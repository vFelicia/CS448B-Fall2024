00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - bash shell scripting for beginners and
00:05 - in this video we will learn what is
00:07 - shell what is bash and what is shell
00:12 - scripting but before that let's talk
00:15 - about who can take this you know
00:20 - tutorial and what are the requirements
00:22 - of taking this tutorial so what I am
00:27 - using is I'm using an open to Linux
00:29 - operating system for this video tutorial
00:32 - series so if you have any you know Linux
00:35 - operating system you will be good to go
00:38 - or if you have you know Mac OS or
00:41 - Windows 10 also you will be able to
00:44 - follow along this video tutorial because
00:47 - Mac OS or Windows 10 nowadays also
00:50 - supports bash shells okay so for this
00:54 - video series I will be using the Ubuntu
00:58 - operating system now if you don't know
01:00 - how to install open to operating system
01:02 - or if you don't know how some Linux
01:06 - commands works I have already made some
01:09 - videos on Linux commands and how to
01:12 - install Ubuntu operating system so first
01:15 - of all see those videos and then you
01:19 - will be able to follow these videos also
01:22 - but I'm will be starting from the
01:25 - beginning so it's not very complex if
01:28 - you are you know beginning you know from
01:32 - this video also you will be able to
01:34 - follow along so first of all what is
01:37 - shell a UNIX shell program interprets
01:42 - user commands which are either directly
01:45 - entered by the user or which can be read
01:49 - from a file called the shell script or
01:53 - shell program now it's important to note
01:56 - here is shell scripts are interpreted
02:00 - and not compiled so when you write a
02:03 - shell script it's interpreted by your
02:07 - operating system and you don't need to
02:11 - compile your
02:12 - she'll script in order to execute it so
02:15 - if you have you know editor you can
02:18 - write your shell script and you write
02:21 - awake and execute it without compiling
02:23 - this shell script right now there are
02:28 - different types of shells and we will be
02:32 - learning bash shell scripting okay so
02:35 - first of all open your terminal and on
02:39 - open - you can just press control oil T
02:43 - to open the terminal or go here and
02:45 - search for the terminal right now in
02:48 - order to search what are the shell types
02:51 - which your operating system supports you
02:55 - just need to write cat and then just
02:59 - write et Cie and then write shells okay
03:03 - so cat /et c /l z' and press enter and
03:08 - you can see these are the different kind
03:12 - of shells which your system can support
03:15 - so for example my Ubuntu operating
03:19 - system support SH - bash and our bash
03:24 - and this bash is what we are going to
03:28 - learn right now what is sh sh stands for
03:34 - bourne shell which is the original shell
03:37 - still used on unix system or unix-like
03:43 - environments right so the first shell
03:46 - which was you know used is this shell
03:50 - now what is bash so Bash stands for
03:54 - bourne-again shell
03:56 - so after this shell this bourne-again
04:00 - shell was reinvented and it's basically
04:04 - based upon an improved version of this
04:07 - as such or Cheban shell and nowadays
04:11 - it's the standard GNU shell which is
04:15 - intuitive and flexible okay so it's more
04:19 - or less the standard shell which is used
04:22 - in most of the Linux operating system or
04:25 - you
04:26 - based operating system including Mac OS
04:29 - and nowadays Windows 10 also okay so
04:33 - these are the shell which are supported
04:35 - by your system now where Bash is located
04:40 - so to know where Bash is located you
04:43 - just need to write which bash ok and
04:47 - then press Enter
04:48 - and you will be able to see this output
04:51 - and this is the location where your Bash
04:54 - is located so now we have all the
04:56 - information about bash and let's create
05:00 - of our first hello world bash script so
05:04 - I'm going to clear the terminal so first
05:06 - of all what I'm going to do is I'm going
05:08 - to just navigate to my Desktop folder or
05:11 - directory and here I'm going to create a
05:15 - new file which is our shell script file
05:18 - ok so I'm going to use touch command to
05:21 - create the file and I'm going to name it
05:24 - as hello dot as such now in it's
05:27 - important to know here is dot SH
05:29 - extension is not necessary to execute
05:32 - your shell script so if you name it
05:34 - hello also it will work totally fine but
05:38 - for us whenever you want to open this
05:42 - shell script using any editor then it's
05:45 - you know useful to have this extension
05:49 - because your editor will be able to
05:51 - understand that this is a shell script
05:53 - file so it will give you a beautified
05:57 - version of this shell script using the
05:59 - editor ok so it's not necessary but a
06:02 - good practice to use this extension now
06:05 - touch command can be used to create a
06:07 - file so let me just press ENTER which is
06:10 - going to create this hello dot SH file
06:12 - you can see here right now let me give
06:17 - you a little bit more detail about this
06:20 - files whenever you create a file which
06:22 - with the touch command and whenever you
06:25 - do LS - L here and press enter you will
06:29 - see here your hello dot SH file have the
06:33 - you know rights here for read and write
06:37 - for you
06:38 - and read and write for the group and
06:40 - read only permission for the user and
06:43 - this we will see later what this means
06:48 - and how we can make this script
06:52 - executable little bit later but let's
06:57 - start writing some script so let's
07:00 - create a HelloWorld script with this
07:02 - shell script so what I am going to use
07:05 - is a editor called Visual Studio code
07:08 - but it's not necessary you can open this
07:11 - shell script using any other editor so
07:13 - for example on my Ubuntu operating
07:15 - system I can use G edit to write my
07:20 - script or as an editor or if you have
07:22 - them or Nano they will work fine but for
07:26 - me I like using Visual Studio code as my
07:29 - editor so I will be using Visual Studio
07:31 - code but it's not necessary you can use
07:33 - any other editor for you know writing
07:37 - script okay so for me I will just give
07:40 - code and dot this is for opening this
07:44 - directory using Visual Studio code but
07:46 - if you don't have Visual Studio code
07:48 - just double click on your shell script
07:51 - and will open with the default you know
07:54 - editor you have okay so my Visual Studio
07:57 - code is open now and you can see I have
08:01 - this shell script here and it's empty
08:04 - right so let's write some you know
08:07 - script here so the first line of script
08:11 - whenever you are writing a bash script
08:13 - its standard practice to use this hash
08:18 - here so first of all just write hash and
08:22 - then this bang here and this is called
08:26 - shebang sometime or hashbang okay and
08:30 - then write the location of your bash so
08:32 - we have used a witch bash to know the
08:35 - location and the location was /bin
08:39 - forward slash bash right so I will write
08:43 - this or whatever the location in your
08:46 - operating system you just need to write
08:49 - this location here so this has
08:52 - the interpreter to know that this is a
08:54 - bash shell script otherwise if you write
08:58 - here for example other shell for example
09:03 - as such then your interpreter will know
09:05 - that it's not bash it saw some other
09:08 - shells interpreter right so first line
09:11 - is that and then you can write entering
09:14 - your you know script so it works same as
09:18 - a shell so and you can give any shell
09:21 - script or any a shell command here so
09:25 - I'm going to use echo and then I will
09:28 - just write hello world here so hello
09:32 - world and echo command is used to print
09:36 - whatever you write in these double
09:38 - quotes okay so I will just save this and
09:42 - I'm going to minimize my visual studio
09:44 - code and now I'm going to execute this
09:47 - script so I have just write written two
09:51 - lines here right this first line for the
09:54 - location and second line is for the echo
09:58 - echoing hello world right so let's
10:01 - execute this so I'm going to just write
10:05 - point or dot and forward slash and the
10:08 - name of your shell script so just write
10:11 - the name of your shell script here okay
10:13 - and then press enter here and now it
10:16 - says permission denied and this is what
10:19 - I wanted to you know show you so because
10:23 - this file whenever you create using
10:26 - touch it has only read and write
10:29 - permission but not execute permission
10:31 - and what we are doing here is trying to
10:33 - execute this right so we need to change
10:36 - the permission of this file first and
10:39 - then execute it so how to change it
10:41 - using chmod command so just write CH mod
10:45 - and then just write plus X and then the
10:49 - name of the file which is hello dot SH
10:52 - which is going to change the permission
10:54 - of this file so I'm going to press ENTER
10:56 - and now just do LS - al once again and
11:01 - now you can see
11:04 - that you have read right by the user and
11:08 - then execute permission by you know by
11:13 - the group and read and execute
11:16 - permission by other users so let's try
11:19 - to execute it again so I'm going to just
11:22 - execute it and now it gave me hello
11:26 - world which is what we wanted to execute
11:29 - or which we wanted to print using our
11:31 - script so this was the first video on
11:33 - bash shell scripting I hope you enjoyed
11:36 - this video in the further videos we will
11:38 - see some more details about bash shell
11:40 - scripting so stay tuned
11:42 - and please read come and subscribe and
