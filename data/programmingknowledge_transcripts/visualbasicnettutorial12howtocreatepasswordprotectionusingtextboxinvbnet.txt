00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to
00:04 - create a
00:06 - simple login form with the help of your
00:09 - Visual Basic Windows Form application so
00:12 - for example when I enter some random
00:15 - password which is not correct it shows
00:17 - me password is not correct but when I
00:19 - enter the correct password second form
00:23 - opens and the first perform disappears
00:26 - all right and in this video because in
00:30 - the last video I haven't shown you how
00:32 - to protect password so for example when
00:35 - you enter some password here the other
00:39 - guys or other people can see your
00:42 - password which is not good in real life
00:46 - situations you want to hide your
00:49 - password from uh the others right and
00:53 - you you want to show something like
00:54 - stars or something like uh dollar sign
00:59 - instead of your real password so I will
01:01 - show you how to how to Simply achieve
01:04 - this uh password protection with your
01:08 - Visual Basic what you need to do is you
01:11 - just need to Simply select your text box
01:15 - and go to the properties
01:19 - and just you will be able to see here
01:24 - password care so you you can define a
01:27 - password care here for example I will
01:31 - Define a password care which is
01:34 - estx and now when I run the
01:37 - program and when I enter some number
01:42 - here it
01:45 - is coming as estx right and when I enter
01:51 - some wrong password it still says me
01:53 - password is not correct and when I enter
01:56 - a real
01:58 - password
02:00 - it opens the second form but the
02:04 - advantage is my password is protected
02:08 - and nobody apart from me can see the
02:12 - password
02:14 - right and you can change this character
02:17 - according to your wish for example you
02:19 - want to change this character as dollar
02:22 - sign and now when you run the program
02:25 - it'll it'll give you dollar sign instead
02:28 - of estx
02:30 - so you can just select uh password C
02:35 - according to your convenience and
02:37 - protect your password from other users
02:41 - so I hope you have enjoyed this video
