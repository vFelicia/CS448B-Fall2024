00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will
00:06 - learn how do you next add command in
00:08 - Linux next add stands for network
00:11 - statistics and net set is a command line
00:14 - tool which is used to display network
00:17 - connection routing tables and a number
00:20 - of network interfaces and in addition it
00:24 - can be used to you know new network
00:27 - protocol State Statistics okay so to
00:31 - Usenet cells that command we can use the
00:34 - keyword netstat and you can use two
00:37 - option with nuts set come on
00:39 - so the first and the default option
00:43 - which you can use with nest set is - a
00:46 - and when you give this method - a it's
00:51 - going to show you all the you know
00:53 - connections which are available on your
00:57 - you know system whether it's a tcp or
01:02 - UDP or unix connection it's also going
01:07 - to display you the status if it's
01:10 - connected all right so listening or it's
01:13 - established and different kind of
01:16 - connection states right but when you
01:19 - give this command and when you scroll
01:21 - little bit more up you will be able to
01:24 - see that you know you they have so many
01:29 - statistics here you can see it has so
01:31 - many statistics that you you know need
01:35 - to use some tools to you know view all
01:39 - these connections at the same time what
01:43 - we are going to do is we will use this
01:45 - match sad which is this one with a pipe
01:50 - called
01:52 - let okay so that's just give the command
01:56 - Nats at a and then the single pipe and
02:01 - then we are going to use the output to
02:05 - display with the less command okay so
02:09 - when I press ENTER now you can see
02:13 - you're giving us the first line of
02:16 - output which can be you know displayed
02:19 - on the full terminal and whenever you
02:23 - want to see more you can just press your
02:26 - down button and see more you know more
02:29 - options so this is more flexible right
02:33 - now
02:34 - you can see there are the state from our
02:39 - listening someone connected some are
02:41 - established you can see the part of this
02:46 - connection and you can see the type
02:49 - whether it's UNIX whether it's UDP or
02:53 - it's TCP connection right and different
02:57 - state can be established listen or
03:00 - connected okay now let me clear the
03:04 - terminal once again to quit this next
03:09 - set giving left command we already know
03:11 - that you need to press Q to quit and now
03:15 - we can use some more options with the
03:18 - matpat come on so with the net set you
03:22 - can use T option which stands for TCP so
03:28 - if you just want to see the TCP
03:30 - connection then you can use a T right
03:34 - and then press Enter is just going to
03:36 - show you the TCP connection you can see
03:40 - the state on the you know you can see
03:43 - here the type of connection which is
03:45 - ppmu okay and once again plus Q to come
03:50 - out of come on
03:52 - because we are using left to view this
03:55 - output right in a similar way if you
03:58 - want to see the UDP connection then you
04:01 - use music clip okay and then press Enter
04:06 - and it's so only going to show you the
04:08 - UDP connection to you so we will come
04:12 - come out of the also killing queue now
04:16 - the next option which we can use with
04:18 - net that is the L lab and L flag will
04:25 - allow us to
04:26 - see the output for the port which are
04:30 - listening okay
04:32 - so L stands for listening state so
04:35 - forgive - L and now you can see whatever
04:41 - you know programs are listening you can
04:45 - see the state all listening states are
04:48 - showing and nothing else right
04:52 - once again I will quit it now the next
04:55 - command is for example you want to see
04:57 - only listening TCP then use LM t for t
05:02 - CB it's just going to show you the
05:04 - listening TCP connection and you may
05:07 - have guessed it correctly that if you
05:10 - want to see the listening UDP we just
05:13 - need to write L you okay I'm going to
05:16 - show you the listing UDP connections
05:18 - right now the next option which you can
05:20 - use with your netstat command is the - s
05:26 - flag and - s flag is for statistics
05:30 - right so when you give - F it's going to
05:33 - show you the statistic just enter and
05:37 - you can see it's showing the statistics
05:39 - IP total packets received how many
05:44 - packets are received or how many packets
05:47 - are going out and you can see which type
05:51 - of connection it is and then the you
05:55 - know properties of the packet what are
05:58 - what is happening so in the UDP 78
06:02 - packets are received and that each
06:04 - package - unknown both with key right
06:07 - and 80 packets are sent right so if you
06:11 - want to feed a statistics of every
06:13 - interface then you can use - s once
06:17 - again I'm going to cut you to quit from
06:21 - this command and then if you get to
06:25 - guess it correctly you can use - SP for
06:30 - TCP right and then if you want to use -
06:34 - s you for UDP okay
06:39 - going to show you the zebra connection
06:41 - and form now if you want to see the PID
06:45 - of the related interfaces then you can
06:49 - use the P minus P option okay
06:54 - so for example you want to see the PID
06:57 - of all TCP connections which are there
07:00 - okay
07:01 - so press Enter and you can see the TCP
07:06 - connection and then we will be able to
07:09 - see the PID related but there is no PID
07:13 - related to because it's state is closed
07:17 - right so let's quit and let's just give
07:22 - the P state here okay so just give minus
07:26 - P and now you will be able to see the
07:29 - PID and the program name so for example
07:33 - we have the UNIX connection and here is
07:37 - the PID of this and the name is daemon
07:40 - liebe liebe demon okay and also you can
07:45 - see the pub and the state is connected
07:48 - here okay
07:49 - so if you want to see the PID of this
07:53 - you know program which is using this
07:56 - connection then you can use the piece
07:59 - lag okay and obviously if you use II
08:03 - will show you the TCP and if you do it's
08:08 - going to show you the nudity and if you
08:11 - going to if you are going to use X
08:14 - continue show you the UNIX or
08:17 - connections okay now if you want to see
08:23 - the numeric code then you use - M okay -
08:29 - the N stands for numeric and then I
08:33 - press ENTER then you can see it's going
08:36 - to show you the numeric ports which are
08:39 - used by different you know interfaces on
08:43 - your system right once again I will cut
08:46 - quit now - C flag is used to show you
08:52 - the network statistics continuously so
08:56 - I'm just removing the left command and
08:59 - when you use net stat - see it's going
09:01 - to show you the status continuously you
09:05 - can see after some time this status is
09:08 - refreshing right so it's going to show
09:11 - you the status continuously once again I
09:14 - am going to the press control-c to quit
09:17 - from this and yes so - c is for
09:21 - continuous okay now there are many
09:26 - options so which you can use with this
09:30 - method one last important command I want
09:34 - to show you is the net set I implement
09:38 - so net that when I saw interface and
09:44 - East End or extended in the field so e
09:48 - is for extend and I sent for in the page
09:52 - right and then you give this command
09:54 - it's going to show you the same output
09:56 - which is given by is pancit come on so
10:01 - when you give is on hey come on it's
10:04 - going to show you the same output as the
10:06 - if on click command give okay so if you
10:11 - want to see what you know connections
10:14 - you have on your system and what is the
10:17 - IP address and the broadcast address and
10:21 - map then you can also use next at ie
10:26 - if it comes it is not available on your
10:29 - terminal
10:30 - okay now some more things I want to show
10:35 - you here in the last video we have seen
10:38 - the graph command and this crap is
10:42 - really helpful whenever for example you
10:45 - want to use the net set command so we
10:48 - can use net stat and then we will use a
10:51 - for all n for numeric and then for
10:55 - example you want to search for from the
10:58 - output some line so for example I will
11:02 - use grab and drag a use to find the sum
11:06 - right in the last video we have learned
11:08 - and then in the single course for
11:11 - example I want to see what are the poles
11:14 - from the output of Nextag which has the
11:18 - both a zero in it okay it has this
11:22 - keyword a zero in it : 8p okay and when
11:28 - I press ENTER you can see it's showing
11:30 - the output put this graph is taking the
11:35 - output from the nets at en come on
11:38 - and then filtering the line which have
11:42 - this keyword : a hero okay so you can
11:46 - combine these command like this also
11:49 - okay and this pipe means here is that
11:53 - whatever is the output of the first
11:56 - command after the spy whatever command
11:59 - is used is going to be implemented on
12:02 - the output of the first command okay so
12:06 - for example if you use left here then
12:08 - it's going to show you the output of the
12:11 - net set command using less if you use
12:14 - graph here then it's going to show you
12:17 - the output of the net set using crap
12:19 - okay so this is how you can use net stat
12:24 - in Linux I hope you and understood the
12:26 - basic concept of net set and I hope you
12:29 - enjoyed this video please recommend
