00:00 - this video we are going to cover about
00:01 - uh head command okay
00:03 - so head command is nothing but a simple
00:05 - command that we basically use to get the
00:08 - uh starting content of a particular txt
00:11 - file okay
00:12 - so when we will demonstrate and then you
00:15 - can easily get okay so let me open up
00:18 - the terminal
00:21 - i hope it is visible to you okay
00:24 - i first create one directory with the
00:27 - head
00:30 - okay
00:32 - and i'll create two files touch
00:36 - now i will create with cad command
00:39 - states dot txt
00:43 - okay and already i have entered the
00:46 - whatever the states
00:49 - okay i will just copy it here and i will
00:51 - paste it there okay
00:56 - enter ctrl d to save and i will again
00:59 - create another command that is a
01:01 - capital.txt
01:06 - okay let me
01:08 - [Music]
01:09 - like this and again i will copy from
01:12 - this
01:16 - okay
01:21 - ctrl d okay so we have created two files
01:23 - you can check with ls command if i will
01:25 - try to read the first
01:27 - here you can see and if i try to write
01:29 - second file that is capital
01:32 - here you can see okay so now we will use
01:34 - the head command okay so what i just
01:36 - said you like what is the head command
01:38 - head command is nothing but which we use
01:39 - to print the starting content of a file
01:42 - so how we can get it so simply the
01:44 - command is head
01:46 - and just provide the
01:48 - file name whatever it is store takes
01:50 - till suppose okay
01:52 - i print uh i will hit enter and here you
01:55 - can see the first 10
01:57 - lines you will get so by default what
01:59 - happens when you use the head command
02:01 - you get the first 10 lines of our txt
02:03 - file so you can count here also like 1 2
02:06 - 3 4 five six seven eight nine and ten
02:09 - okay so this is the one of the feature
02:11 - of the head command okay so
02:14 - if you want to like suppose you want to
02:15 - print on the first two lines okay for
02:18 - this what you can do you have to nothing
02:20 - just provide the like uh hyphen n option
02:23 - or you can do it head
02:26 - iphone hand
02:28 - do
02:28 - and state start
02:30 - txt
02:31 - so here you can see we have only just
02:33 - got the only first two lines if you want
02:36 - to print first five lines then also you
02:38 - can do it like from
02:41 - five okay
02:44 - so and what if you want to like
02:47 - get the content of two files
02:49 - simultaneously how you can do it so it's
02:51 - also our simple command of it is like a
02:53 - head
02:54 - [Music]
02:56 - stage.txt and what was other capital.txt
03:00 - hit enter so here you can see the
03:02 - first incontinence of both the files
03:04 - okay
03:06 - so
03:09 - now what if you want to print only first
03:11 - five
03:13 - first five line of both the files
03:16 - so you can see here you can see three
03:17 - plus two five three plus two five okay
03:21 - so here we are getting five lines and
03:23 - here also we are getting five line so
03:25 - with the help of iphone and option we
03:27 - can easily uh get uh whatever uh number
03:30 - of lines which you want to like display
03:33 - in the on this terminal okay
03:36 - and also there is another option that is
03:38 - a hyphen c option what it does so hyphen
03:40 - c option is nothing but uh like which we
03:42 - we use to get the
03:44 - uh like content of a particular size
03:46 - okay suppose if you want to print the
03:48 - content of only
03:50 - first
03:51 - like 30 bits or 10 bits so then for this
03:54 - we can use a hyphen c option okay
03:58 - so uh let's use it
04:01 - hyphen c
04:02 - i will provide uh
04:05 - for
04:07 - states.txt
04:09 - so here you can see a ndh why this
04:11 - because this is only
04:12 - four bytes okay first four bytes it will
04:15 - provide us and what if i want to
04:19 - hit
04:19 - 12
04:21 - so here you can see it is just me
04:22 - providing me the 12 bytes okay this is
04:25 - uh
04:26 - 3 3 six seven and again this is five
04:29 - seven plus five that is the 12 bytes
04:31 - okay
04:32 - so in this way you can use the hyphen c
04:34 - option and also you can see use i think
04:36 - together also for capital let me use
04:40 - and as you can see in stress dot txt you
04:42 - are getting this and in hyderabad you
04:43 - are getting
04:45 - this
04:46 - okay
04:48 - so uh and also there is one more option
04:50 - is remaining in this like hyphen v
04:52 - option what it does it basically just
04:54 - provide you the verbose information and
04:56 - iphone will stand from verbose
04:58 - which basically shows you the like
05:00 - information about execution of command
05:02 - like that let me use it for states
05:06 - so here you can see stress dot txt like
05:08 - if we not use hyphen we option then
05:10 - let's see what happens
05:12 - nothing okay
05:14 - so that's all guys for this particular
05:17 - video so i hope you liked it and we will
