00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:05 - in this video we will see how to use
00:08 - tables in HTML so let's get started
00:12 - first of all to add a table you need our
00:15 - tag called table to add it and inside
00:21 - the table you have some more elements so
00:26 - for every table we have rows so we need
00:30 - to add our table row element first so
00:33 - just add TR which stands for table row
00:37 - okay and inside the table comes our
00:41 - columns right so for columns
00:44 - use a tag called TD which stands for
00:48 - table data okay and here you can provide
00:54 - your content for example we are making
00:56 - some table for name surname and the
01:00 - marks scored by a student for example
01:04 - something like this so the first column
01:07 - here is the name and the second column
01:10 - we are going to add is the surname and
01:14 - the third column we are going to add
01:17 - here is the maths code by him so for
01:20 - example 90 marks right so TD you can
01:24 - think of it as a column TR is the table
01:29 - row and table is the parent of all right
01:35 - so you can add in a same way multiple
01:38 - table rows inside your table something
01:42 - like this one row below another right so
01:46 - right now we have a table with two rows
01:48 - with three column each right so we are
01:51 - going to save our code and refresh our
01:54 - page and it looks like this now you will
01:58 - see here there is no border in the table
02:00 - so to add a border you need to add a
02:04 - attribute to your table which is called
02:08 - border itself and you can provide here
02:11 - one then
02:13 - we'll have the bottle so save it and
02:15 - refresh your web page and it's going to
02:18 - give you this kind of a border now if
02:21 - you want to stretch your table to the
02:24 - width of your browser web page what you
02:27 - can do here is add an attribute called
02:31 - style and add an attribute called width
02:38 - here so width is equal to hundred
02:42 - percent okay so just add one hundred
02:46 - percent here save your web page and
02:48 - refresh it and it will stretch to
02:51 - hundred percent okay now if you want to
02:55 - add heading to your table what you need
02:57 - to do you can just add one more row
03:00 - something like this and instead of using
03:04 - TD which stands for table data you can
03:07 - use th which stands for table head okay
03:11 - so th th th for column and here also
03:17 - th th and th and here you can give some
03:22 - heading for example name surname and
03:26 - marks okay and save it and refresh our
03:30 - page AZ will give you the heading to
03:34 - your table okay there is one more
03:37 - element which you can add to the table
03:40 - which is called caption so just add a
03:44 - element called caption and inside the
03:46 - caption you can give the caption to your
03:48 - table for example my name table okay
03:54 - save it and refresh our page it's going
03:58 - to give you a caption for your table
04:00 - okay
04:01 - now to add more styles to your table
04:04 - what you can do here is in your head you
04:07 - can add a style element inside the style
04:12 - element you can add the style for a
04:15 - table for example so table and include
04:19 - table head and table detail here so th
04:24 - comma T
04:26 - d okay and for example I want to remove
04:29 - the border from here and I want to add
04:31 - it in the style attribute here what I
04:35 - can do here is I can add a border like
04:38 - this okay so the width of the border is
04:43 - 1px and solid and it's black okay save
04:48 - it and refresh your page and you have
04:51 - the same border now you can see here the
04:55 - border is of two lines right now if you
04:59 - if you want one line here you can
05:01 - collapse your border so you can add an
05:04 - attribute here border
05:06 - - collapse and then add collapse here
05:12 - okay and save it and refresh your web
05:16 - page it's going to collapse this border
05:19 - like this okay now one more property you
05:23 - can add here is the alignment for your
05:27 - text so you can add text - a line and
05:33 - you can align it to the left for example
05:37 - so left and save your web page and
05:41 - refresh it and it will align your text
05:44 - to the left you can do the same for the
05:48 - right so just add right here save it and
05:51 - refresh it and it's going to align your
05:55 - text to the right right so I will use
05:59 - the left one for now now there are three
06:02 - more special elements you can add to
06:05 - your table element which our table had
06:08 - table body and table foot okay and these
06:14 - will give you the ability to have extra
06:18 - styles to your tables okay so for
06:21 - example for the table had you can add
06:24 - attribute like tea head okay and just
06:30 - close it at the end of your row or for
06:33 - your header right so end it here and
06:37 - same you can have
06:39 - the body so just add tea body it'll add
06:45 - a body for your table and end it at the
06:50 - end of your body content it can have any
06:53 - number of rows right for the footer you
06:56 - can add an attribute called tea foot and
07:01 - end it here and this is one not going to
07:06 - change anything in your table so when I
07:08 - save it and when i refresh it it's not
07:11 - going to change anything in the table
07:14 - but now it's really easy to use them to
07:19 - change the style for example I want to
07:22 - change the style of table head I can
07:26 - just use th for table head and then
07:31 - change the background color for example
07:34 - background color is equal to red okay
07:39 - and same I can change the style for
07:43 - table body and table foot so tea body
07:48 - and color is blue and the foot and the
07:56 - color I choose is yellow okay and save
08:02 - your web page and refresh it and your
08:06 - row color has been changed okay
08:09 - now there is one more property called
08:12 - column span so that you can have one
08:16 - column in two column spans okay so I
08:20 - will give you an example for example I
08:22 - want two headings and not the three
08:26 - headings so what I can do is I can
08:29 - remove this middle heading from here and
08:32 - I can add an attribute called column
08:35 - span and I can give the span of two so
08:39 - that it will cover two columns at the
08:42 - same time right and save it and refresh
08:45 - your web page and you can see now marks
08:49 - heading is taking two column spans
08:53 - like this okay so in this way you can
08:57 - use tables in HTML I hope you enjoyed
