00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install and
00:04 - setup vagrant on your Windows operating
00:07 - system so first of all what is vagrant
00:11 - vagrant is a virtual machine manager
00:14 - which uses command-line interface to do
00:17 - all the tasks on the machine now vagrant
00:20 - is an application that helps in building
00:23 - consistent development environment with
00:26 - ease but what does this mean so let me
00:29 - give you an example so as a developer I
00:32 - develop many application day-to-day and
00:36 - I just give these applications to my
00:40 - colleagues to test them so let's say I
00:42 - am developing a C++ application which
00:45 - runs on a Linux machine and this C++
00:49 - application interacts with some database
00:52 - now I have created some dummy data
00:55 - to test my C++ application in the
00:59 - database now this C++ application I want
01:04 - to give it to my colleague to test also
01:07 - but how can I pass or how can I transfer
01:12 - the same environment to my colleague so
01:15 - that so he can test the same C++
01:18 - application in the same database
01:20 - environment with the same data which I
01:23 - have generated
01:24 - that's where vagrant comes into the
01:26 - picture so using vagrant you can just
01:30 - create and destroy virtual machines
01:34 - really fast and then you can transfer
01:37 - the vagrant file to your colleague and
01:40 - using this vagrant file he can generate
01:43 - the same environment on which you were
01:45 - working on so it's easy to transfer the
01:48 - development environment from one machine
01:50 - to another so your software can be
01:54 - tested in the similar situations so
01:56 - let's see how we can download and
01:58 - install vagrant on our Windows operating
02:00 - system now to download and install and
02:03 - setup vagrant
02:04 - you need three things one is vagrant
02:07 - itself
02:07 - second is VirtualBox and third is some
02:11 - SSH client
02:13 - so let's start with the VirtualBox so
02:17 - search for the VirtualBox on your
02:20 - favorite browser and then the first link
02:22 - which will appear here will be from
02:24 - virtualbox.org II and then you can just
02:28 - select Windows host from here and then
02:31 - you can download this VirtualBox and
02:33 - it's pretty straightforward to download
02:36 - and install VirtualBox so I'm not going
02:38 - to show you how you can download and
02:40 - install this you can just download this
02:44 - executable file and just press some next
02:47 - button and VirtualBox will be installed
02:49 - on your system
02:50 - so when VirtualBox is installed it'll
02:52 - look something like this okay now the
02:56 - second thing is to download the vagrant
02:59 - MSI file so just search for vagrant here
03:02 - and the first link which will appear
03:04 - here will be from vagrant up comm so we
03:08 - are going to click on that website and
03:11 - then we will reach to the home page of
03:14 - vagrant up website and here we will just
03:16 - click on the Downloads button which is
03:19 - this one
03:20 - downloads 2.0 point 0 which is the
03:23 - latest version at the time of making
03:24 - this video and then we will select the
03:27 - windows option and then we will just
03:29 - select the 64-bit option right and then
03:33 - I'm going to save this MSI file and
03:35 - while this MSI file is downloading on my
03:39 - system what I'm going to do is I'm going
03:42 - to download a terminal which is better
03:47 - than my Windows command prompt which
03:50 - comes with Windows 8 or Windows 10 right
03:53 - so generally you need to have SSH in
03:56 - order to use vagrant now by default this
03:59 - SSH is not present on your Windows
04:04 - operating system you can use putty tool
04:07 - to use SSH but I would like to use a
04:11 - command line tool which is called CMD ER
04:15 - commander is essentially a Windows
04:19 - terminal with additional UNIX command
04:23 - line support ok so just search for CMD
04:26 - ER
04:27 - and the first length which will appear
04:28 - here will be from CMD e are.net just
04:33 - click on this website and you can see it
04:36 - will look like this so it's terminal
04:38 - which supports some UNIX command so it
04:42 - also comes with SSH and this CMD er is a
04:47 - zip file so it's not an executable file
04:50 - it's a dot zip file so we just need to
04:52 - extract it and start using this terminal
04:55 - tool okay so I have downloaded the
04:58 - vagrant dot MSI file and CMD er dot zip
05:03 - file so once they are downloaded I'm
05:05 - going to just show you how to install
05:07 - vagrant and then use this commander tool
05:10 - to create our vagrant box so now this
05:14 - vagrant dot MSI file is downloaded so
05:17 - I'm going to just click on this MSI file
05:20 - and then I'm going to click OK and then
05:23 - it's going to start installing vagrants
05:25 - and then I'm going to see this kind of
05:27 - setup wizard I'm going to minimize the
05:29 - browser for now and then I'm going to
05:31 - just click Next and I will accept
05:33 - license terms and condition and click
05:35 - Next this is the default location where
05:38 - vagrant will be installed so if you
05:39 - don't have the good reason to change it
05:41 - just leave it as default and click Next
05:43 - and now I will wait for the installation
05:45 - to complete it's pretty straightforward
05:47 - and easy to install vagrant in the
05:50 - meantime my CMD er dot zip file is also
05:54 - downloaded so I'm going to just extract
05:57 - it to the folder of my choice you can
06:00 - extract it anywhere you want so now the
06:02 - vagrant installation is finished on my
06:05 - system so I'm going to just click finish
06:07 - and now it says you must restart your
06:10 - system for the configuration changes
06:12 - made to vagrant to take effect
06:15 - so just restart your Windows operating
06:17 - system and then we will and then we will
06:21 - see how we can create our first way
06:23 - grant box so now I have restarted my
06:25 - Windows operating system and vagrant is
06:28 - already installed on my system so I will
06:30 - just start this CMD er dot exe file
06:34 - which I have extracted from commander
06:37 - dot zip file so just double click on
06:39 - this Exe file
06:40 - and then click ignore and continue and
06:42 - then click cancel and here first of all
06:46 - we are going to check the version of
06:48 - vagrant so just right way grant here and
06:52 - then - V - no the version of a grand
06:55 - installed and if it returns the version
06:58 - that means it's perfectly installed on
07:01 - our system so you can see vagrant
07:03 - version 2.0 point zero is installed on
07:05 - my system right so now we need to create
07:09 - a vagrant box in order to use it and how
07:11 - can we search this vagrant box so for
07:16 - that you just need to visit the grind up
07:18 - comm once again and then you can see
07:21 - this button which says find boxes so
07:24 - just click on this button and then you
07:26 - can see different boxes which you can
07:29 - you know configure and install on your
07:32 - system so the most popular one is Ubuntu
07:35 - for sliced US Trustee 64 and then you
07:39 - can see different versions of different
07:42 - Linux operating system so you can see
07:45 - send to s vagrant box or Debian vagrant
07:49 - box or different vagrant box you can
07:51 - find here so what we are going to do is
07:54 - we are going to just install and setup
07:56 - this o bun - trusty 64 so just click on
08:00 - this and here you can see the vagrant
08:03 - file of this box will look like this but
08:07 - we are interested in just initializing
08:10 - this box and creating this box so this
08:13 - is the command which we need to use so
08:16 - first of all what we will do is we will
08:19 - just go to the folder where we want to
08:23 - create our box so let me create a folder
08:26 - here and I will name it as Ubuntu for
08:29 - example and then I will just CD into
08:33 - this folder so just copy the path from
08:35 - here and then CD into this folder and
08:38 - then we will just give the vagrant
08:41 - command so just give vagrant and then
08:45 - box add and then the name of your box
08:48 - which is Ubuntu forward slash trusty 64
08:51 - which is this one right so just copy and
08:53 - paste it
08:54 - and then press ENTER and for the first
08:57 - time it's going to take some time to
08:59 - install the necessary files so just wait
09:01 - for this command to complete and then we
09:04 - will initialize our box so now this box
09:07 - is successfully added to my system so
09:10 - now the next step is to initialize this
09:13 - box with this vagrant init command so
09:16 - just copy this vagrant in it
09:18 - Ubuntu forward slash trusty 64 command
09:21 - and then just press ctrl V to paste this
09:24 - command and then press ENTER and you can
09:26 - see this vagrant file is generated in
09:29 - this directory so I can just go to my
09:33 - directory where I'm working in so you
09:36 - can see this vagrant file is generated
09:38 - using this vagrant init command so now I
09:41 - just need to give the vagrant up command
09:44 - in order to start my box so you can just
09:48 - give this command which is vagrant up
09:51 - and then paste it here and then just
09:54 - press ENTER so now the vagrant up
09:57 - command is finished on my system so let
09:59 - me clear the terminal and now I'm going
10:03 - to give this command vagrant SSH to
10:06 - connect to my virtual machine ok so just
10:11 - give this command vagrant SSH and if
10:14 - this command gives any problem in my
10:17 - case you can see it's not connecting to
10:20 - the machine and it's not even giving any
10:23 - result then how we can debug this
10:26 - problem so in order to debug it you just
10:29 - need to give vagrant SSH - config and
10:34 - then press Enter which is going to show
10:37 - you your SSH config for vagrant so you
10:41 - can see the username of the ubuntu
10:45 - trustee must machine is vagrant and this
10:48 - is the SSH key private key in my case
10:52 - and then this is the default port right
10:55 - so what we are going to do is we are
10:57 - going to manually connect to the machine
11:00 - so vagrant SSH if it fails this command
11:04 - then we will connect manually to
11:07 - the machine so just give this command
11:09 - SSH and then the username username is
11:13 - vagrant in our case and then at the rate
11:16 - so just give this at the rate symbol and
11:20 - then your hostname so username at the
11:25 - rate hostname host name is 127.0.0.1 in
11:30 - our case and then the port name with
11:33 - minus p flag so minus p and then the
11:36 - port name port name is two two two two
11:38 - you can see here and the next option is
11:41 - to give the private key part so just
11:44 - give - I and then copy this path from
11:49 - here so just copy this part this whole
11:52 - path for the identity file so just copy
11:55 - this whole path and then paste it and
11:58 - then press Enter so now you can see I'm
12:02 - connected to my virtual machine so you
12:06 - can see the username at the rate vagrant
12:09 - - Ubuntu
12:11 - - trusty 64 so this is the terminal so I
12:16 - will just make my font a little bit
12:18 - smaller so you can see so I have given
12:20 - this command and then I am connected
12:24 - remotely to this virtual machine which
12:28 - is for Ubuntu 64-bit right so in this
12:32 - machine I can just develop or install my
12:36 - software and test it for example with
12:38 - some database or anything any
12:39 - configuration and then transfer this
12:43 - vagrant file to my colleague for example
12:47 - and then he can use the same vagrant
12:50 - file to create a machine and then you
12:54 - know use the same environment right now
12:56 - you may ask what is the purpose of
12:59 - installing VirtualBox we haven't used
13:02 - VirtualBox anywhere so just open your
13:06 - VirtualBox and you will see this machine
13:09 - is running here so it turns out you
13:11 - don't need to do anything vagrant will
13:14 - do automatically this for you so it will
13:17 - start running this virtual machine on
13:20 - your voice
13:20 - box automatically so you don't need to
13:23 - do anything you just need to install
13:25 - virtualbox in order to use vagrant so
13:29 - here I can just do LS and for example I
13:33 - will just check preggers present working
13:35 - directory so I'm in this home /t a
13:38 - current directory and I can start
13:40 - working on this virtual machine right so
13:44 - in this way you can install and setup
13:46 - vagrant on your Windows operating system
13:48 - I hope you enjoyed this video please
