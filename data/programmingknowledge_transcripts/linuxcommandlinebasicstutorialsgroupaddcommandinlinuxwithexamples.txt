00:00 - in this video we are going to talk about
00:02 - groups okay what are the groups in linux
00:04 - operating system
00:06 - so basically as the name suggests you
00:08 - can think like a group as a like group
00:10 - of some kind of users group of
00:12 - politicians group of actors and this is
00:14 - the name suggest but in
00:16 - linux we can create different kind of
00:18 - groups
00:19 - like we can get separate groups for
00:21 - developer for pen tip from for pen test
00:24 - different groups and for marketing team
00:27 - different groups so basically this is
00:29 - the basically mostly use of groups like
00:31 - we can create different goods for
00:32 - different types and we we can provide
00:34 - them the
00:36 - like different permissions according to
00:38 - their role
00:40 - so there is a basic simple command index
00:42 - like group ad okay using this command we
00:45 - can basically
00:46 - uh create groups in our operating system
00:48 - and i hope this is visible to you let me
00:51 - increase the size first
00:52 - [Music]
00:54 - oh it's too large let me do this yeah
00:56 - now it's fine
00:58 - so how you can do it uh the one command
00:59 - which i told you right now it's group
01:02 - add
01:02 - and what you have to do you have to just
01:04 - provide the name of the group which you
01:06 - want
01:07 - so
01:08 - uh
01:10 - i will name it as a
01:14 - like
01:15 - developers
01:18 - okay so here you can see it is showing
01:20 - permission denied so one thing here also
01:22 - is like
01:23 - uh the group group ad command is or can
01:26 - be
01:27 - only performed by those users whether
01:30 - they are root or whether
01:32 - they have a certain permission of root
01:34 - permission or you can say whether they
01:36 - are in the s file
01:38 - okay so in that file if any user in that
01:40 - particular file so they can easily uh
01:43 - use this particular uh feature of sudo
01:46 - command okay
01:47 - so i'm
01:49 - in that file like this user
01:51 - that yeah you show what i will do i will
01:52 - just add sudo
01:54 - and it will ask me
01:56 - to enter the password
01:58 - done and we are done here you are not uh
02:02 - getting any kind of output or something
02:04 - but let me tell you one thing like when
02:06 - you create this uh
02:08 - or when you add
02:10 - this group add command or you add or
02:13 - different groups so at that time what
02:15 - happened there are the two files which
02:17 - gets affected when you hit this
02:19 - particular command
02:21 - one is
02:25 - one is group which are located in the
02:28 - slash ctc
02:29 - directory and the one another is
02:34 - slash etc g shadow
02:37 - okay
02:38 - so i will show you the content content
02:41 - of uh
02:43 - group file okay like in shadow file
02:46 - it basically contains the like when you
02:49 - create a group with password
02:51 - like they are not much required because
02:54 - like if there are multiple you just and
02:56 - like
02:57 - your password will get uh
02:59 - like compromise you can think of of it
03:02 - okay so these are the two files which
03:05 - get affected when you whenever you
03:07 - create a group okay so let me show you
03:09 - the content of first cad slash etc
03:13 - like group file
03:15 - and here you can see you see there are
03:17 - the multiple groups here okay there are
03:20 - multiple groups the first group it may
03:22 - be root okay this is the root
03:24 - and these are some system users and here
03:27 - in the last video we had covered about
03:28 - vr234
03:30 - so whenever you add a new user then the
03:32 - separate groups is also created okay so
03:35 - right now what we have added we have
03:37 - added developers okay
03:39 - so developers is one of the group and x
03:42 - is for password and this is the group id
03:45 - okay so let me show you the detail
03:47 - information about this particular file
03:49 - so that will be
03:52 - more clear for you guys okay so in this
03:54 - picture you can see
03:55 - like cd rom x
03:57 - 24
03:59 - and this will be a question one thing
04:00 - these are the users
04:03 - but in our case users are not visible
04:05 - why
04:06 - because we have not still added users in
04:08 - our group so we will do this in our next
04:10 - video okay
04:12 - so in this particular video we will only
04:14 - create groups like you will see
04:15 - different options how you can do it
04:17 - and here you can see the like uh
04:20 - detailed information about that
04:21 - particular file so here you can see cd
04:23 - rom cd rom is what just the name of your
04:25 - group like here you can see one
04:27 - indicates the group name like it is the
04:29 - name of the group if you run ls and this
04:31 - command you will see okay
04:34 - and then this is for password which we
04:36 - have not provided this is the gid that
04:37 - is the group id and the group list like
04:40 - who are the users present in this
04:42 - particular
04:43 - group
04:45 - i hope that is clear to you okay
04:48 - so now what i will do uh i will try to
04:50 - create a group with
04:52 - some
04:53 - another gid
04:55 - okay
04:56 - so
04:57 - for this we can use the only one option
04:59 - is that that is hyphen g option which
05:01 - will help you to create
05:04 - uh like uh
05:06 - group with different gid
05:08 - okay so but before that i want to uh i
05:11 - want to show you one more option that is
05:13 - hyphen f option what it does
05:15 - sorry basically
05:19 - uh when you want to create a
05:22 - group with the same name then let's see
05:24 - what happens okay
05:26 - so i'm going to enter the same command
05:27 - again let's see what happens
05:30 - here you can see group developer already
05:32 - exist but what if you want to
05:35 - like if you don't want to see this error
05:37 - message or you want to forcefully create
05:39 - that particular
05:40 - like developer group so in this case you
05:43 - can use which option you can you just
05:46 - hyphen f option hyphen it just stands or
05:48 - forcefully okay or you can say force
05:51 - so in this case what will happen i will
05:53 - hit enter and here again you can see
05:57 - same developer 1502
06:00 - okay so now in this case now what i will
06:03 - do
06:04 - wait a minute
06:06 - why my screen is not
06:14 - okay
06:21 - okay
06:22 - so now what uh i will do i will try to
06:24 - create a group with some different gid
06:26 - okay so how you can do it uh for this we
06:29 - have a hyphen g option
06:32 - group ad and still i will use hyphen f
06:34 - option because i don't want to create
06:36 - some other groups i would just want to
06:38 - work on this particular developer's
06:39 - group
06:40 - hyphen app then i will use hyphen g
06:43 - and i will provide this 2000
06:45 - let's provide it 2022 and the name still
06:48 - remains same that is developers and i
06:51 - have not added
06:53 - it's more important with the help of
06:55 - sudo you can perform anything in linux
06:59 - just hit enter and then again we will
07:00 - see the content
07:03 - and here you can see okay it
07:07 - our g id
07:09 - not added here
07:10 - okay let me check
07:13 - we have entered correct command or not
07:16 - oh yeah there is a hyphen g option is
07:18 - correct
07:21 - ok
07:23 - let's try to
07:27 - create a friend group
07:30 - testers
07:34 - okay
07:35 - so what happened
07:38 - like when we were we were using hyphen
07:40 - option then in that case we cannot
07:42 - change this gid
07:45 - but with other when you will create new
07:48 - group then you can uh change like
07:51 - this gid like you can create your
07:55 - you you can create like a group with
07:57 - your own gid okay
08:00 - so like in this way you like you learn
08:02 - something new like you can't do like
08:03 - that if someone asks you to perform the
08:05 - same thing then you can use this i know
08:07 - it is not possible to change this gid
08:12 - using hyphen f option
08:14 - so uh now what we i will do uh there is
08:16 - also one command that we can use like uh
08:19 - like for getting the list of users what
08:21 - i am typing i am typing the square cache
08:23 - ctc slash group
08:25 - okay but instead instead of this we can
08:28 - use the
08:29 - one command that is g
08:32 - tent
08:33 - and
08:37 - then group
08:43 - and here you will get get the list of
08:45 - all the groups which is present in our
08:47 - system
08:49 - okay and to delete the groups you can
08:51 - easily uh delete it using the group dell
08:53 - command that is very simple that is what
08:55 - i will do group tell
08:57 - and i will just pass the name of the
09:00 - group which you want to date i want to
09:01 - delete testers
09:04 - and hit enter again permission a9 why
09:06 - because we have not used sudo let's use
09:08 - sudo
09:10 - and then again get list of
09:12 - that
09:14 - get list where it is
09:17 - okay so here you can see tester has been
09:19 - removed
09:21 - so i hope you guys like learn about how
09:23 - we can add groups in our link system and
09:25 - but in our further video we will see
09:27 - like how we can add users in particular
09:30 - different groups
09:31 - like there is also a separate command
09:33 - for this task that is the user mod or
09:35 - you can say user modification also
09:38 - like there are many uh properties of
09:40 - this particular command we will learn
09:42 - all about this in the next video okay
09:44 - so that's all for it and we'll meet in
09:46 - the next video so thank you thank you
09:48 - for watching and we'll meet you next one
09:50 - thank you
