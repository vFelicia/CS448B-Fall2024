00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video I've shown you how to use
00:06 - line chart in Java effects so when I
00:09 - click this button it's going to load
00:11 - this kind of a line chart now for
00:15 - example I want a line chart with
00:18 - multiple lines so this is only one line
00:23 - chart but for example I want multiple
00:27 - line chart how can I do it let's see so
00:31 - I'm going to continue with my last
00:34 - example which I have shown you which is
00:37 - this example in which I was creating a
00:41 - XY chart series and then adding it to
00:45 - the chart using this button method okay
00:49 - so I'm going to add the new code to this
00:53 - button method itself so this was one
00:57 - line so to add multiple lines what you
01:02 - can do is you can just copy the same
01:04 - code for the series and then once again
01:08 - paste it here so you have two instances
01:12 - of series right and let's say this is
01:14 - series one variable and just to replace
01:19 - this everywhere in the second series and
01:22 - then you can change the values here okay
01:26 - so for example four hundred one hundred
01:30 - eight hundred and five hundred okay so
01:35 - this is our second line series and let's
01:40 - change the legend value also for example
01:44 - this is p1 and this is p2 okay and to
01:52 - add this new series to the line chart
01:55 - what you can do is you can just keep
01:57 - this code line chart get data but in
02:01 - here instead of using ad you must use ad
02:04 - all ok so just use ad all and then you
02:10 - can add multiple series here so
02:13 - Oh series and then series one variable
02:16 - okay
02:17 - now save your code and run it once again
02:20 - and when I click this load chart button
02:25 - it's going to give you the two lines
02:29 - series okay and you can see the legend
02:34 - here pay one and pay two in the same way
02:37 - if you want a three line chart what you
02:42 - can do you can just paste it once again
02:45 - then series two and just copy it here
02:49 - once again and then change the values
02:53 - for example here and 650 for example and
03:01 - this will be pay three and then add this
03:05 - series two to your chart something like
03:08 - this okay save your code and run it once
03:12 - again and now you have a chart with
03:16 - three lines okay so in this way you can
03:20 - add a multiple a line chart in JavaFX I
