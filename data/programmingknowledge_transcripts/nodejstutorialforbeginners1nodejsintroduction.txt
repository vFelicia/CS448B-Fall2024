00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - node.js tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video I'm going to give you a brief
00:07 - introduction about node.js so let's get
00:10 - started
00:11 - node.js was originally written in 2009
00:14 - by Rhian dell the initial release was
00:19 - supported only Linux but in the later
00:22 - years of node.js it also started
00:26 - supporting Windows operating system and
00:28 - Mac OS also now its development was led
00:35 - by of course R and L and later the
00:39 - development and maintenance was
00:42 - sponsored by Joe and Joe and was his
00:46 - employer now let's see what is node.js
00:53 - so nodejs
00:54 - is an open source cross-platform runtime
00:58 - environment for developing server-side
01:01 - web application so normally you would
01:06 - link JavaScript with client-side web
01:10 - applications but with node.js you can
01:13 - develop server-side applications also
01:17 - now node.js is an event at i/o and this
01:22 - evented IO we will learn in the later
01:25 - videos what is event at IO and how we
01:28 - can use it ok so although node.js is not
01:33 - a JavaScript framework many of its basic
01:36 - modules were written in JavaScript and
01:39 - developers can write new modules in
01:42 - JavaScript the runtime environment
01:45 - interprets JavaScript using Google's v8
01:50 - JavaScript engine which is also the
01:53 - JavaScript engine behind chrome which is
01:57 - a web browser which makes it really fast
02:01 - now node.js is released under MIT
02:05 - license so it's a cross-platform
02:08 - open-source
02:09 - you know framework
02:12 - so let's go next now what node.js is not
02:18 - so as I already told you node.js is not
02:23 - our web framework it's a server-side web
02:27 - application right so you can write
02:30 - server-side web applications with
02:32 - node.js not the client-side right
02:35 - node.js is not for beginners so whenever
02:39 - you are you know starting node.js you
02:43 - need to have basic understanding how you
02:47 - know JavaScript works mainly object
02:50 - oriented JavaScript and event did
02:53 - JavaScript so you need to have some
02:55 - knowledge of JavaScript but don't worry
02:58 - I will you know start with very basic
03:01 - level so you will be able to understand
03:03 - and mostly most of them are you know
03:07 - servers if you think about servers you
03:10 - may link servers as a multi-threaded
03:13 - application but node.js is not a
03:16 - multi-threaded application it uses the
03:20 - concept of asynchronous IO which we will
03:24 - also see in the later videos now what is
03:28 - unique about node.js so javascript is
03:33 - used in client-side but no JS puts
03:37 - JavaScript on the server side as I have
03:40 - already told you thus making a
03:43 - communication between client and server
03:45 - will happen in the same language so the
03:48 - learning curve for you will not be you
03:52 - know so steep because if you know
03:56 - JavaScript you can write the front end
03:59 - and the back end of your web application
04:02 - both in JavaScript
04:04 - right now servers are normally a thread
04:09 - based as I have already told you but
04:12 - node.js is event based node.js serves
04:17 - each request in a invented loop that can
04:20 - able to handle simultaneous requests so
04:25 - node.js is not a multi-threaded
04:28 - application okay so it only have one
04:31 - thread which uses event and the last
04:35 - this is also I have already told you
04:37 - that JA node.js program are executed by
04:41 - v8 JavaScript engine the same engine
04:45 - behind the Google Chrome browser also
04:49 - now why you want to learn node.js
04:54 - because node.js is really fast it can
04:58 - handle tons of concurrent requests and
05:01 - it's written in JavaScript which means
05:04 - you can use the same code on server-side
05:07 - and client-side so this is the brief
05:10 - introduction about node.js and from the
05:13 - next video I will start explaining how
05:15 - you can install node.js and how we can
05:17 - you know write our first code for
05:21 - creating our first node.js server so I
05:24 - hope you've enjoyed this video please
