00:00 - a Lopez and welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge the previous video we learned
00:06 - about how to create a registration form
00:09 - and take the inputs from the user and a
00:12 - friendly to the console so this video
00:15 - will bitching about how to take that
00:18 - data and store it within a database so
00:22 - for that you need first of all is a
00:25 - SQLite tree browser so we sqlite3
00:28 - database which is a database provided in
00:33 - pythons you just import it normally
00:36 - don't have to use any fee procedure so I
00:40 - just import it and so we have a previous
00:46 - function that is a print e and D so
00:51 - commented out and create a new function
00:54 - that is function database and here we'll
01:03 - write everything regarding the on
01:05 - database procedures so just follow along
01:12 - everything will be everything will
01:15 - remain the same just you have to add
01:17 - another function so and okay so now take
01:28 - a variable name one is equal to F n dot
01:34 - and get on this function on this and
01:41 - will function greatly affects the value
01:43 - from that widget and the widget now you
01:47 - can use the last one is equal to hell
01:53 - then Lord get same you can just copy
01:58 - this then you can take it for the date
02:08 - little good lord get then create another
02:15 - variable for country is equal to Lord
02:21 - get then you can create tinea for
02:27 - programming languages of your choice
02:29 - gender is equal to well let's try to
02:40 - don't have to get use get metroid in
02:44 - this because you already mentioned over
02:46 - here fighting and java as you can see so
02:51 - moving on forward we'll be using it for
02:56 - gender now that is a radio button radio
03:01 - or to web ordinate okay so I guess we
03:08 - are done with fetchingly tales from the
03:09 - widgets now we will just let the
03:13 - procedure for the hub is connectivity so
03:16 - use a variable of your choice I'm using
03:22 - on is equal to sqlite3 not connect so
03:29 - usually this is the procedure for
03:31 - connecting with the database and in here
03:35 - we'll be mentioning the database name
03:37 - for example we perform on baby
03:47 - now with calm and the colon then he will
03:55 - lose Inco so for it is this is disabled
04:01 - on basic procedures will be to perform
04:06 - is equal to con dot course also you will
04:11 - find this in the documentation of
04:12 - sqlite3 this other man duty procedures
04:16 - to create a database along with the
04:19 - table and etc
04:21 - and now from here we'll be starting to
04:28 - create a table for that cursor Lord
04:33 - execute so this statement of line will
04:37 - be used to create a table so follow
04:39 - along execute em so everything will be
04:50 - capital D is table if not exist okay and
05:09 - the table name will be student then is a
05:21 - bracket the column name first name then
05:29 - we'll be providing a data output text
05:34 - then we'll be using last name then here
05:37 - is just your word in the column Leon
05:39 - nothing much
05:40 - with along with editor type these are
05:42 - the basic SQL procedures in from date on
05:49 - both text comma for country text
06:04 - [Music]
06:08 - should be in uppercase
06:13 - you
06:16 - you
06:24 - drink and then for programming column to
06:28 - convention any name you want and text
06:37 - for that then for gender and here we'll
06:49 - be finishing off the table that's it for
06:59 - the table now we'll move on to the
07:02 - inserting values that we are fetching
07:05 - from here for example for in here we are
07:09 - taking the variables name last one date
07:13 - of birth and we are using the get method
07:15 - to get that data from that widgets which
07:18 - are being used in the interface so
07:22 - follow along same procedure will be
07:25 - using cursor and God execute and for the
07:31 - insult
07:32 - wheezing insert into student table names
07:40 - and mention the columns that you have
07:49 - used above laughs as same as this like
07:55 - this last a Oh gob n etc and last then
08:03 - we'll be using our TOB then country then
08:10 - programming comma gender okay so just a
08:17 - list check anything is right okay
08:20 - everything is right and just remove this
08:28 - and
08:33 - these values what rights are going to
08:36 - get inserted into that table so values
08:41 - then will be facing pushing Mount
08:44 - Rushmore
08:45 - engaged on the number of columns for
08:47 - example here there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 so
08:52 - here are the empty values so based on
09:02 - the number of columns that is named last
09:05 - date of birth control program program
09:09 - and gender death is 6 column will be
09:12 - using 6 question marks and so and we
09:29 - sing the variables that we are using to
09:34 - fetch the data that is over here so we
09:41 - are using this variable to get the data
09:44 - from those widgets just use the antenna
09:49 - 2 1 comma gate from country form make
10:03 - sure that the variable name are same
10:06 - okay comma gender so 6 widgets and 6 and
10:19 - we are getting from that get method ok
10:22 - and focus I guess to the creation of the
10:30 - table as well as the insertion of value
10:33 - who think that table student is done so
10:35 - this is the function used for inserting
10:39 - that it ends with database one more
10:43 - method is left that is we need to commit
10:47 - whatever I am terms will just use this
10:50 - commit method to save all the data which
10:53 - is saved into the database and use this
10:58 - function database into the
11:01 - you
11:06 - button that is over here that is a login
11:08 - button so here we are using the login
11:11 - button to execute that database program
11:18 - or will function here I am also using
11:20 - the key binding method in Kindle so for
11:24 - example if I press enter
11:28 - instead of taking on to the mouse you
11:31 - can also use Enter key to execute that
11:34 - command so it's not I'll just save it
11:37 - and run so I guess there is no error so
11:45 - let's enter some data country yeah
12:00 - fighting and real so there is some error
12:08 - let's see what they say
12:13 - so this let's let's
12:24 - you
12:29 - so the issue is over here.i programming
12:33 - P is kept low over there we are used
12:36 - this outage so I guess it is done save
12:42 - this and execute again
12:52 - okay so that's we enter the data let's
12:56 - see there is any error home on
13:05 - this put some random data
13:10 - you
13:11 - you
13:16 - still there is some error so the number
13:25 - of our empty values is five and we have
13:29 - six phones
13:34 - you
13:39 - let's use one more which I'll save and
13:44 - try again
13:53 - okay I should be 10 by 9 so this puts in
14:01 - angle beta gamma country okay so I guess
14:14 - the database is created with the center
14:18 - go on more data
14:26 - Sami personal data rates
14:33 - this change
14:39 - and this okay so we have created the
14:45 - table and inserted values within this so
14:49 - let's check the table so for that you
14:54 - can use this
14:59 - so here is a forward DB so to check
15:03 - whether the values are within the table
15:06 - or not use
15:09 - you
15:17 - you sleep in browser or SQLite
15:22 - we'll be back for SQLite and open
15:26 - database and we'll go to desktop this is
15:35 - the database as you can see this is a
15:41 - table student and now we have the
15:43 - columns over data types so as you can
15:47 - see we're here in this other columns
15:48 - name last date of birth country
15:53 - programming and gender so this is data
15:57 - as we have fetched through the inputs of
16:02 - other widgets of Pinter so the procedure
16:09 - of creating the database is done we have
16:12 - successfully insert data within it so
16:15 - this is it put the pool for this video
16:18 - will be available in the description and
16:20 - this is it for this video guys and
16:22 - thanks for watching
