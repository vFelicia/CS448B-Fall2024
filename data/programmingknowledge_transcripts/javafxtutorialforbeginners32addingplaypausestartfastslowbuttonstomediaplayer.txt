00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - javax tutorial for beginners in the last
00:04 - video I've shown you how you can create
00:07 - a media player using Java FX now in this
00:10 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:12 - add some more functionality to your
00:14 - media player for example you want to add
00:17 - some buttons like play pause you want to
00:20 - play your video in a faster rate or
00:22 - slower rate or you want to reload your
00:26 - video how you can do it I'm going to
00:28 - show you in this video so let's get
00:30 - started first of all go to your uh main
00:33 - controller class which we have created
00:36 - in the last video so you need to uh you
00:40 - know go through the last video in order
00:42 - to uh catch up with this video okay so
00:46 - in the last video we have written uh
00:48 - this code to load our video and then
00:53 - autoplay our video right now we are
00:56 - going to create some methods to
01:00 - play pause and other
01:02 - functionalities right so first of all we
01:05 - are going to create these methods so
01:08 - just
01:09 - write public void and let's say our
01:14 - method name is uh play and just add a
01:18 - action event here and just add an
01:21 - argument event and inside your method
01:25 - what we want to do is we want to uh play
01:29 - our videoos so just take your MP or
01:32 - media player object and then just call a
01:36 - method called play here okay now uh in
01:41 - the last video I've shown you how you
01:43 - can autop play or enable the autop
01:46 - playay functionality for your media
01:48 - player now you have your play button so
01:51 - you may not use uh this um uh autoplay
01:56 - functionality or you may not wish to use
01:58 - this autoplay functionality so I'm going
02:00 - to commment this if you want to use it
02:02 - you can play use it right now in the
02:06 - same way I'm going to create some more
02:08 - methods 1 2 3 4 and second method I'm
02:14 - going to name it
02:15 - as pause third method I'm going to uh
02:20 - name it as fast and fourth method I'm
02:24 - going to name it as slow and the fifth
02:28 - method I'm going to name it as
02:31 - reload and I'm going to create two more
02:34 - method to uh you know move your video to
02:38 - the start and the last so the second
02:41 - last method is start and the last method
02:46 - is last okay now for the pause
02:51 - functionality you just need to call
02:53 - pause uh function on your media player
02:56 - object to make your video fast or run
03:00 - faster what you need to do is you need
03:02 - to uh call a method called set rate
03:07 - which takes a double value so if you
03:10 - provide here a value of one then your
03:13 - video will run in a normal speed right
03:16 - and if you uh write here two then your
03:19 - video will run in the double speed of
03:23 - your normal speed and if you write here
03:26 - 0.5 then your video will run in uh
03:30 - slower speed which is half the speed of
03:32 - your original size so this is our fast
03:35 - function so we will run it in the double
03:39 - speed of the normal speed in the same
03:42 - way we can uh set the rate for slower
03:45 - speed so just write 05 here which will
03:48 - run your video in the half speed and
03:51 - then to load the video you just need to
03:54 - call a method called seek here and which
03:58 - takes uh an argument which is duration
04:02 - right so you can just uh call your media
04:06 - player and then call a method called get
04:10 - start time so this will uh you know move
04:13 - your video to the start right and in the
04:18 - same way uh you can uh just pass the
04:21 - same function here then uh your uh video
04:25 - will be moved to the start and for
04:27 - reloading we will add this function
04:30 - which is play so that your video will be
04:33 - moved to the start and it will start
04:35 - playing so just write
04:37 - mp. play Okay so this will be your
04:40 - reload function and this will be your
04:44 - start functionality which will only move
04:46 - your video to the start but it will not
04:49 - play right now the next and the last
04:53 - functionality is the last so we want to
04:55 - move our video to the last so you just
04:58 - need to call MP do seek and as an
05:01 - argument you just need to write
05:04 - mp. get total duration which is the
05:08 - total duration of your video now in
05:12 - order to stop your video you can call a
05:14 - method called uh mp. stop so we can uh
05:19 - you know in the method start we can uh
05:21 - just move the video to the start and
05:24 - then after this we can stop our video so
05:27 - just write MP do stop here okay so you
05:33 - can add one more button for uh this
05:35 - stopping but I'm going to just uh add
05:38 - this in the start function uh so you
05:40 - know uh there is a method called stop
05:43 - from which you can stop the video also
05:46 - so these are our functions or method
05:50 - which we want to use now let's open our
05:53 - main. fxml file and we will call these
05:56 - method in the button functionality so
05:59 - right right click on your main fxml file
06:01 - and open with scene Builder and in the
06:04 - scene Builder we are going to uh go to
06:08 - the containers and we are going to take
06:12 - the horizontal box and drag and drop at
06:15 - the bottom of your bord border pane okay
06:19 - and then we will go to controls and we
06:21 - will take some buttons
06:23 - one
06:26 - 2
06:28 - 3 4
06:30 - 4
06:32 - 5 and six let's see how many methods we
06:36 - have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so we need one more
06:41 - button so just take one more button from
06:44 - here and then add the method name so
06:48 - first button is uh play second button
06:54 - is pause third button is fast fourth
06:59 - button button is
07:02 - slow fifth button
07:05 - is reload sixth button is
07:10 - start and the seventh button
07:14 - is stop
07:17 - okay now uh let's add these method to
07:21 - these button so select your first uh
07:24 - button and then go to the code property
07:27 - here and then in on action uh uh method
07:31 - here or on action event here just choose
07:34 - the method called play from here okay
07:37 - for the pause just choose pause for the
07:41 - fast just choose uh
07:43 - fast and for the slow just choose the
07:46 - slow method and then for the reload
07:50 - choose reload for the start choose the
07:54 - start and for the Stop choose the stop
07:59 - top we don't have right so we need to
08:02 - name it as last right we have the last
08:06 - method so just choose the last method
08:10 - okay and then save your code and then
08:14 - refresh your projects right click and
08:16 - refresh and then run your application
08:19 - once
08:20 - again and now you can see you have uh
08:23 - buttons in your uh you know applications
08:28 - right so for example I want to play my
08:30 - video I can just hello guys in this
08:33 - video I'm going to show you how you can
08:35 - add Java FX support in your
08:38 - e press the play button so it will play
08:41 - my video and now I'm going to pause it
08:44 - so this is going to pause my video now
08:47 - if you want to uh play the video in the
08:50 - faster rate we will see uh this
08:52 - functionality in a moment but let's
08:55 - reload the video so just uh click this
08:59 - this reload button and it's going to
09:01 - reload it and play it now uh let's press
09:05 - the start button and it's going to uh
09:08 - you know uh place your video to the
09:12 - starting position and let's press the
09:15 - last button is going to place your video
09:17 - to the last position right let me uh
09:21 - minimize my volume a little and once
09:24 - again play
09:25 - it and now it's playing okay now in
09:30 - order to play your video faster you need
09:32 - to press this button so let me uh
09:34 - increase the volume and let me press
09:37 - this button and you can just hear
09:43 - it so it's playing faster which is two
09:47 - times faster than the normal rate and
09:50 - now you can press low
09:54 - button and now it's uh playing slow okay
09:58 - but when you press play once again here
10:02 - it's also playing in the same rate so
10:06 - this time in a play button you need to
10:08 - add the functionality to set the rate to
10:11 - the one or original rate so you just
10:15 - need to go to your play button and here
10:17 - you just need to write MP do set rate
10:24 - and you need to uh you know add one here
10:28 - which will play your your video in the
10:30 - original rate okay and run it and you
10:34 - can check the functionality once again
10:37 - so in this way you can add uh these uh
10:40 - extra functionalities to your media
10:42 - player and maybe I will add one more
10:46 - video to uh you know add volume bar and
10:49 - other functionality uh I don't know if
10:52 - I'm going to make this video or not but
10:54 - stay tuned and please rate comment and
10:56 - subscribe and bye for now
