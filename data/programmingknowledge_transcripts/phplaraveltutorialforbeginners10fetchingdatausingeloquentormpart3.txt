00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part number 10 of our
00:06 - laravel for beginners tutorials and in
00:09 - this video we're going to cover how to
00:11 - display the information coming from our
00:15 - database and using the Luke went over em
00:17 - so we're going to display our post so
00:21 - basically from the previous tutorial we
00:23 - have worked with our controller post
00:25 - controller and our post model and of
00:28 - course we have laid out the basic layout
00:31 - of our index that laid that PHP where in
00:34 - which we already iterated the post
00:38 - coming from our database and also making
00:40 - our title as link so that we could click
00:44 - on that link and then be redirected to
00:47 - another page where in which you can see
00:49 - the full details of that particular post
00:51 - and also we have added the created at or
00:55 - written on date and then I have realized
00:59 - that we are we use the class well which
01:03 - is not included in in bootstrap anymore
01:06 - so we're going to use card for this
01:10 - class and in our app that blade that PHP
01:13 - file we're going to add the post page so
01:19 - we have here all the items are all the
01:22 - links from our navigation so home
01:25 - services and about so we're going to add
01:28 - another link or another item in our
01:32 - navigation bar so this should be all
01:36 - about the blog which contain all the
01:39 - posts and of course this should be all
01:42 - about posts so let's go back to our
01:45 - browser and try to preview and let's try
01:48 - to refresh the page so as you can see we
01:51 - now have the home services and of course
01:53 - the blog which is added recently so
01:56 - click on that and you can see we have
01:59 - here a deposed and I think we can take
02:02 - this further so instead as you can see
02:04 - this is somewhat ugly for now so let's
02:07 - try to modify this in our code editor so
02:11 - let's go back here in our
02:13 - index that played that PHP and yet as
02:15 - you can see we have here with the card
02:18 - right but instead of using a ch3 I think
02:22 - we're gonna use the UL for now so this
02:26 - is coming from our bootstrap integration
02:30 - on so so you L so inside this and it
02:35 - should have a class list group and then
02:40 - list group flush flush there you go and
02:47 - then of course inside here is the list
02:50 - item which has the title of our post so
02:55 - it should have a class list group item
02:59 - and in here we're going to place instead
03:03 - of using the h3 so we're going to or I
03:08 - think we could keep this h3 in this area
03:14 - so h3 so there you go instead of using
03:21 - HC only so we're facing the title and
03:25 - acclaim created add date inside a list
03:30 - item we should reiterate the list item
03:35 - so let's go back and try to add or
03:41 - remove this and add it here and so with
03:46 - the closing dev and closing l unordered
03:54 - list tag so there you go and then save
03:59 - that and refresh so as you can see we
04:03 - have now a slightly different version of
04:05 - our post so if you try to click on this
04:11 - post so we still have a blank page so
04:16 - we'll try to work on that for now and
04:17 - let's go back to our code editor so
04:20 - let's go to our post controller and as
04:23 - you can see we have here a function
04:26 - that says show that takes in a parameter
04:30 - ID so we can just edit this function and
04:34 - try to return a single post so return
04:38 - and then post and of course you can use
04:42 - a function here called fine and then
04:46 - specifying the ID and let's just save
04:50 - this and try to preview in our page so
04:53 - refresh and here you can see that this
04:58 - is the post one and this is the body of
05:01 - the post one so let's try to check and
05:04 - click on the post to so there you go the
05:07 - idea is to and the title is post own and
05:11 - now let's take this further and try to
05:13 - beautify this instead of just seeing the
05:16 - array of data so let's go back to our
05:20 - code editor and instead of returning
05:24 - basically just the post so we're going
05:27 - to return a view just like what we have
05:31 - in our index function so post and then
05:35 - we're going to return a certain view so
05:39 - this view will be a post or under the
05:44 - folder post or directory post with the
05:49 - show that blade that PHP file name and
05:53 - this should go with our post variable so
06:00 - and then the actual variable post and of
06:05 - course we can try to get this on our
06:11 - post as show file so let's try to create
06:15 - that on our post directory so let's try
06:20 - to create a new file here so this should
06:23 - be show that laid that PHP ok and then
06:30 - we're just going to copy the mark-up
06:33 - from this index that laid that PHP and
06:35 - paste it here and then we're going to
06:38 - extend the layouts as well
06:40 - and of course you can get rid of this
06:43 - because we're not dealing with we're not
06:46 - dealing with an area so we can just have
06:48 - or we can just use the post variable and
06:52 - then you can get the title from there
06:54 - and of course we can also get the other
06:59 - attributes so the post body and of
07:02 - course the created on attribute so we're
07:07 - going to add it here by placing it
07:10 - inside a small tag so this should be
07:14 - written on and of course double curly
07:19 - braces and then in our post variable
07:21 - with the created on attribute and I
07:27 - think we can add an HR here so HR
07:32 - horizontal rule and then of course we're
07:35 - going to add the body or the post body
07:40 - of the particular post so post and then
07:44 - the body of the post so let's try to
07:49 - save this and preview on our page so
07:56 - this is the current version all we see
07:58 - is an array of values coming from a
08:00 - particular post but if we try to refresh
08:03 - this now we can see the post title and
08:08 - the post body and of course the I think
08:13 - we misspelled instead of using created
08:17 - on I think it is created underscore AET
08:23 - or at and then save that and refresh so
08:28 - we have here all the information the
08:31 - post title post body and of course d
08:34 - created at date so post one and then
08:40 - post two and I think we could also add a
08:43 - button or back button here so let's do
08:47 - that so above the post title we'll just
08:51 - try to add a
08:53 - back button here so it should be a link
08:56 - that goes to the post and of course it
09:02 - should go it should say go back and it
09:06 - should have a class of a button so BTN
09:10 - and then BTN default so save and refresh
09:16 - so we have here a link that tells us to
09:21 - go back to the post or to the page where
09:25 - all the posts are displayed so I there
09:28 - you go
09:29 - post two and then post one and then
09:34 - let's go back so what if you want to
09:37 - sort by
09:39 - maybe title or ID ascending or
09:43 - descending so let's try that on our
09:45 - index function of our post controller so
09:49 - as you can see we are doing the post and
09:53 - then post modal and then double double
09:57 - colon and then all so we can actually
10:01 - sort by title or ID so whatever you want
10:06 - to sort by so say for example let's just
10:10 - comment this one out and try to copy
10:13 - that
10:13 - suppose we can say here order by and
10:21 - then the attribute that you want your
10:25 - records to be sorted by so title say for
10:29 - example in this case title and we can
10:31 - say descending or the des e and of
10:37 - course we need to say get and refresh
10:42 - here so as you can see now the post o is
10:47 - the first one to appear here instead of
10:49 - the post one and if you try to go as
10:54 - sort by ascending sort by title as
10:57 - ascending there you go refresh so the
11:03 - post one is the first one two
11:07 - we're here in our post page and actually
11:10 - you can also use the SQL commands or SQL
11:14 - statement and our controller to get all
11:17 - the post coming from our database so all
11:19 - you have to do is use the DB class so
11:22 - actually I'm going to show you that real
11:24 - quick because it it is very easy to get
11:26 - all the records coming from our database
11:28 - by using the DB class so we're just
11:32 - going to use DB and of course and here
11:38 - we're going to comment that one out for
11:42 - now and use this as our variable per a
11:47 - post so post and then equals the DB and
11:52 - of course the Select function and our
11:57 - SQL command which is select all from
12:01 - host and then let's just save this and
12:05 - refresh so we still have all the post
12:10 - coming from our database so post one and
12:12 - post all so I think that's all for this
12:14 - particular video and in the next video
12:16 - we're going to discuss forms and how to
12:18 - save data so I hope you learned
12:21 - something from this video and see you in
12:23 - the next video thanks
