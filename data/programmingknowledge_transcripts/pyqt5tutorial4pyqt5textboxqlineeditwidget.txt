00:00 - hey all welcome to programming knowledge
00:02 - hope you are all doing good so this is
00:05 - the tutorial in which we are going to
00:07 - create a simple app where you will be
00:09 - having a textbox and a button inside the
00:12 - window and the features of this app will
00:16 - be whenever you can write the message in
00:20 - the text box by just clicking on the
00:22 - button that texts that have been entered
00:25 - in the textbox will be shown inside the
00:26 - message box let's say I am going to
00:29 - write my name is James in the text box
00:32 - and like I am clicking on the button so
00:35 - what will happen our message box will be
00:37 - popping up along with that message which
00:40 - is my name is James so let's go ahead
00:43 - and create that so in the last tutorial
00:47 - we have used the used this code to
00:50 - create the button and the window so I am
00:53 - going to do add just the message box and
00:56 - the textbox and the like process for
01:00 - that which is the input and output let's
01:03 - go ahead and create this one the first
01:07 - thing which I am requiring is like I
01:09 - need a cue action which is I am going to
01:14 - import cue action here we go I have
01:19 - imported the cue action from PI 25 which
01:22 - it followed by I need a cue line edit in
01:28 - order to like edit the text box and
01:31 - write our message followed by I need a
01:35 - cue message box where the message will
01:37 - be displayed so here we go we need to
01:40 - import that so we have imported the
01:42 - required thing now we have already
01:45 - defined the title left of width and
01:48 - height so this has already been defined
01:52 - that is window title and followed by
01:54 - self dot geometry so here what we are
01:57 - going to do is we are going to create a
01:58 - text box so let's go ahead and create
02:01 - the text box which is wise
02:03 - first we use the self keyword along with
02:07 - that we are going to use the text box
02:12 - self not text box equals to what we are
02:17 - going to do we are going to use the Q
02:19 - line edit which we have imported here we
02:22 - go it's popping up so we are going to
02:24 - use a Q line edit and inside the
02:27 - parenthesis we are going to use the self
02:29 - keyword here we go we have created a
02:33 - text box like variable inside by using
02:37 - the self keyword and inside that we are
02:39 - views Q line it it and the next thing
02:43 - what we are going to do just like we did
02:45 - in button your we are also going to use
02:48 - the Move part which is by using self dot
02:51 - text box which is this one here we have
02:56 - created dot move so inside the move
03:01 - let's Ford some value which is 20 comma
03:04 - V T if we go we did that so the next
03:09 - thing what we are going to do is we are
03:11 - going to use the resize like whenever I
03:15 - am going to maximize the text box should
03:17 - also be maximized or minimized based on
03:20 - the requirement of hours and I'm going
03:24 - to use the self no text box dot resize
03:27 - and inside the colon I am going to
03:31 - voyage to eighty comma forty here we go
03:38 - we did that now as we have created a
03:43 - text box with the file with the three
03:46 - things which is self dot text box and
03:48 - move and resize
03:49 - now we are going to alter some things in
03:52 - the button part as the in order to
03:56 - perform the operation so we are going to
03:59 - use first self keyword which is self dot
04:02 - button and let's give some other name
04:06 - for this button which would provide show
04:10 - text like button will be created along
04:13 - with the show text of these of it as a
04:16 - caption for the button so here we go
04:20 - self dot button has been catered now
04:23 - what I'm going to do I'm going to use
04:27 - still dot button dot move and let's
04:33 - provide the let's change the value to
04:36 - only not I don't need to have 100 comma
04:40 - 70 I will get a smaller one which is 20
04:43 - comma 80 so here also we will use the
04:47 - self keyword okay this is not required
04:50 - actually as we are creating a simple one
04:55 - so I am going to remove this self dot
04:57 - button dot self tool set tool T which is
05:00 - a decent example button so I am going to
05:02 - remove that here we go there's the three
05:05 - things are required two things are
05:07 - required so self dot button and self dot
05:11 - button dot move which we did it for self
05:15 - context box don't move now what I am
05:18 - going to do these one statement which is
05:21 - remaining so the next step what we are
05:24 - going to do is you are going to connect
05:25 - the button to function on click which is
05:27 - this so we don't need to write the
05:31 - separate code we will use this code and
05:34 - just by using self dot button dot click
05:39 - dot connect I have just used the self
05:43 - keyword to connect these button to
05:46 - function on click so here we go we did
05:50 - that so in the on lick part as in the
05:56 - last tutorial what happened is like a
05:59 - message was shown which whenever I am
06:01 - clicking on the button which is PI qt5
06:03 - button clicked so here we are going to
06:06 - change these to make sure that whatever
06:09 - we are writing on the text box that
06:11 - should be prompted on the message box so
06:13 - in order to do that first thing what we
06:16 - are going to do is we are going to
06:17 - create a variable called textbox value
06:20 - and inside this we are going to set the
06:24 - text box which is by using self dot text
06:28 - box dot text here we go
06:35 - we have
06:36 - the self self dot text box which is this
06:40 - one dot text here we go we have said
06:47 - that text box value and now what I'm
06:50 - going to do is like I'm going to use the
06:54 - cue message box which we have imported
06:56 - here we go it's showing is showing it as
06:59 - as you know here we go we have used the
07:02 - queue message box which we have imported
07:04 - and by using that what we are going to
07:07 - do we are going to use the dot operator
07:08 - and we are going to use the costing
07:16 - method which is Q here we go it's
07:20 - popping up so we have used the Q message
07:23 - box which we have imported following
07:25 - with that we have used the question
07:26 - method and inside the parenthesis we are
07:30 - going to first use the self keyword
07:32 - followed by let's say I'm going to
07:36 - provide the caption has message and I'm
07:43 - going to provide inside the double
07:48 - course which is you have typed this will
07:53 - be popped up in the message box I am
07:56 - going to write you typed here we go so I
08:02 - pointed the you typed and the message
08:05 - should be shown right so I'm going to
08:07 - add on the plus text box value which is
08:12 - this one so we have said the cell phone
08:15 - text box text right so this one will be
08:18 - provided you typed the text box and you
08:21 - so the next thing what we are going to
08:23 - do is like we are going to make sure
08:25 - that Q message box work so in order to
08:28 - do that we are going to again use the Q
08:30 - message box and provide dot okay this
08:37 - will make sure that queue message box is
08:39 - there so Q again I am going to provide
08:42 - let's party two times which is Q message
08:47 - box
08:48 - okay here we go we have provided the cue
08:52 - message box and so after doing this what
08:58 - we are going to do we are going to set
09:01 - the self dot text box here we go the
09:11 - Xbox self dot this box is there so dot
09:14 - you are going to set the text and inside
09:20 - that let's keep it blank here we go I
09:25 - would like to explain what we did over
09:27 - here so in this one click method we have
09:31 - changed set of things which is we have
09:32 - created the text box value variable
09:34 - inside that we have users like self dot
09:37 - text box your text which is the text
09:40 - value that needs to be displayed so and
09:42 - after that we need a message box to
09:44 - display the text right so we have used
09:46 - the cue message box which we have
09:48 - imported from qt5 widgets so we have
09:53 - imported that and like we have used the
09:57 - self keyword and provided the message
10:02 - like and you typed which is for example
10:08 - if I am reading down the text and
10:09 - clicking on the button so what will
10:11 - happen caption with you typed along with
10:14 - the message that you are writing in will
10:16 - be showed we will discuss this while
10:19 - running the program after that we have
10:22 - my qs+ textbox value which is indicating
10:26 - our message that we have typed and
10:30 - followed by we have provided cue message
10:33 - box dot ok and cue message box not okay
10:35 - two times to make sure that cue message
10:38 - box is popping up and lastly we have
10:40 - also used the text box or dot set text
10:44 - to make sure the message is eccentric
10:47 - here we go we have provided the code
10:51 - let's go ahead and run the program now
10:58 - we are going to run the program here we
11:01 - go we are going to run the program here
11:09 - we go
11:11 - is displayed so here we go as you can
11:13 - see the output is displayed with PI QT 5
