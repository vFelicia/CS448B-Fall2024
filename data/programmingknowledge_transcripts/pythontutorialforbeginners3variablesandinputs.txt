00:00 - hello guys welcome to the third video
00:02 - tutorial on Python programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video I'm going to
00:07 - show you how to use variables in Python
00:11 - so I'm assuming that you don't have any
00:15 - prior programming knowledge so uh I'm
00:19 - going to uh tell you the basics of
00:21 - variables first so basically what is a
00:25 - variable variable is a container for or
00:30 - some value this value can be an integer
00:34 - this value can be a string of words this
00:38 - value can be a float value or different
00:40 - kind of values so what is a variable
00:44 - variable is a container for the values
00:49 - so for
00:50 - example how you can declare variable in
00:54 - Python first of all you need to give a
00:57 - name of the variable so for example
00:59 - example I can declare a name of a
01:01 - variable like
01:05 - my
01:07 - variable is equal to and this is equal
01:10 - to sign you use between the value and
01:14 - the name of the variable okay so this is
01:17 - the name of the variable is equal to you
01:20 - can assign some value to the variable
01:22 - for example 30 now my variable has the
01:27 - value of 30 so my variable is a
01:30 - container for the value 303 right and
01:35 - generally it's the convention that
01:38 - whenever you use or declare a variable
01:41 - it's not necessary but it's a good
01:43 - programming habit that you uh separate
01:46 - your uh variable name if you have uh
01:51 - something like my variable the first
01:55 - word of your variable name start from
01:57 - small letter and then
02:00 - the second word first letter starts from
02:03 - big or a capital case and the other
02:06 - letters are small
02:09 - and this way it will work like for
02:12 - example I want to give the variable name
02:14 - is equal my variable name it will be
02:18 - like this okay so it's like camel case
02:23 - it's called a camel case declaration so
02:28 - start with small letter
02:30 - and then the second letter uh second
02:32 - word first letter is the capital third
02:36 - word first letter is the capital just
02:39 - like this okay so just follow the
02:41 - convention like this it's not necessary
02:43 - but it's good now when I press enter now
02:48 - my variable has the value of 30 so once
02:51 - again when I uh call
02:54 - [Music]
02:56 - my variable and press enter it gives me
03:00 - 30 because my variable is equal to 30
03:03 - now now python is a case sensitive
03:07 - language so if you write my with a
03:12 - capital
03:14 - M
03:17 - variable and press enter it will give
03:20 - you an error because this variable name
03:24 - is different from this variable name
03:27 - because this is case sensitive so just
03:30 - remember
03:32 - this okay so these are the two things
03:38 - now why we exactly use variable in any
03:44 - programming language so variables are
03:47 - generally used uh whenever you don't
03:51 - know what values you are going to deal
03:54 - with so for example you are going to
03:58 - deal with uh some
04:00 - values which are inputed by the users
04:05 - now first of all this variable you can
04:08 - use it as for example for adding
04:11 - something so I can just
04:13 - call
04:17 - my
04:18 - variable
04:20 - plus so plus 34 and it will give me the
04:24 - result uh yeah this is you see I haven't
04:29 - spell this my variable correct so it
04:31 - gives me an error okay so
04:35 - my
04:37 - variable plus 34 and it gives me 64 okay
04:43 - so now you can perform math operation
04:46 - using this variable also okay now the
04:49 - real use of this variable you can uh you
04:53 - can perform every math operation on this
04:56 - variable because it has some value which
04:59 - isn't an integer right so you can do a
05:03 - variable to the power or
05:07 - exponent uh three it g gives the answer
05:10 - and in the same way it will give you an
05:12 - answer for every uh math operation now
05:16 - the real use let's see some use for
05:20 - variable so for example I declare a
05:23 - variable
05:25 - called
05:28 - uh value
05:31 - okay and this value is equal to whatever
05:35 - user inputs from uh the user uh input
05:40 - okay so how you can provide a user input
05:44 - in Python you just use a inbuilt
05:46 - function called
05:49 - input so this is a inbu function in uh
05:53 - python which will allow you to enter any
05:57 - value so you can just write
06:01 - enter the
06:04 - value but there is a problem with this
06:08 - that this input whatever user enters
06:11 - will be a string
06:14 - okay so let me give you an example when
06:18 - I press enter now it giv me the prompt
06:21 - that enter the value and I can enter any
06:24 - value for example 50 and press enter and
06:28 - now this value which is a variable value
06:33 - has the value of 50 so whenever I call
06:37 - Value it has the value of 50 but notice
06:41 - this value is a string it's uh between D
06:44 - this single codes so whenever I want to
06:49 - uh perform some addition so Value Plus
06:53 - something 20 it'll give me an error see
06:57 - it give me an error why it's giving me
06:59 - an error because this value which is 50
07:04 - is a string because whenever we use
07:07 - input function to input value it takes
07:10 - this value as a string okay and whenever
07:14 - you see something in single code that
07:16 - means it's a string whenever you have
07:20 - the single quotes around your value it's
07:22 - a string okay now in order to convert
07:25 - your uh string to an integer you can
07:29 - cast
07:30 - the string so I'm going to just copy
07:33 - this just you can just copy this and
07:35 - paste it here and in order to cast this
07:39 - value to an integer what you do just go
07:44 - before your input so value is equal to
07:47 - just write int so this is type casting
07:50 - of string to the
07:53 - integer okay and just close it from here
07:57 - okay so when you do this this uh will be
08:03 - your string so uh input will be taken as
08:05 - a string and this int will convert your
08:09 - string to the integer okay and now when
08:14 - you press enter and you give some value
08:16 - for example 60 value is equal to 60
08:21 - and now you call
08:23 - Value not well
08:26 - but Val you it has the value of 60 and
08:30 - notice that earlier this 50 is uh
08:34 - enclosed in single codes but this time
08:36 - it's not enclosed in single codes that
08:38 - means it's a number right now I can
08:42 - perform some math operation on this like
08:45 - this Value
08:49 - Plus uh
08:51 - 50 multiplied by 60 something it will
08:55 - not give me an error this time so always
08:58 - remember when ever you want an integer
09:01 - as a input you need to cast this into
09:05 - the integer and Casting means to convert
09:08 - your string to the integer you can cast
09:13 - this to the float value
09:16 - like this for example you can just copy
09:20 - this once again paste it here and you
09:23 - can cost this like
09:27 - uh clo
09:29 - so float is a decimal point value okay
09:33 - so you can cast your value as a float
09:36 - and now when you enter you can just
09:38 - write
09:39 - 50. 134 whatever and then call
09:44 - Value it has the value of 50 point
09:48 - whatever okay
09:51 - so variables are useful whenever you
09:55 - don't know what values you are going to
09:58 - deal with okay so that's all about
10:02 - variables I hope you have enjoyed this
