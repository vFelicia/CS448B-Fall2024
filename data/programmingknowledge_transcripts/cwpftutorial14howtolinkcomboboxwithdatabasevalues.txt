00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next tutorial
00:03 - on WPF application using cop till now we
00:08 - have made uh an application where we can
00:13 - save update or delete data in the
00:16 - escolite database using our WPF
00:21 - application on
00:24 - cop in this video I will show you how to
00:27 - connect combo box with your sqi database
00:33 - so for example I need a combo box and I
00:37 - want to
00:38 - populate all the names in the my
00:42 - database so let me show you my database
00:46 - first so for example I have this
00:48 - database where I have table employee ID
00:52 - name surname and age and I want to show
00:56 - all the list of names in the combo box
01:00 - so first of all what is a combo box
01:04 - combo box is like this so you have a
01:09 - drop- down menu so when you click combo
01:11 - box it will show some values list of
01:14 - values okay so in the same manner I want
01:17 - to show all the names in the combo
01:21 - box in
01:22 - my WPF application so how can I do that
01:27 - I will show you now
01:31 - so first of all I will stop
01:35 - debugging so I have this form and I will
01:39 - go to my tool box and I will take a
01:41 - combo box from here and drag and drop in
01:46 - my
01:49 - window if you want you can change the
01:51 - name of this combo box I leave this
01:55 - combo box name as
01:58 - default and then what I will do is I
02:01 - will go to its code section so right now
02:06 - I'm in second do XML file and I will go
02:11 - to second. xml. CS file which is it's
02:15 - code
02:16 - file and I will make a new
02:20 - function make sure that you are making
02:23 - your the new
02:24 - function below this declaration of
02:28 - escolite connect string
02:31 - datab So Below
02:35 - this you uh can make a
02:40 - function so for example I want to make a
02:44 - function for filling this combo so I
02:46 - will name my function as
02:50 - fill combo
02:53 - function
02:55 - okay bracket and bracket
02:57 - closed this is my function
03:00 - and it's returning nothing so I
03:04 - will give void as return and in here I
03:09 - will write my
03:10 - code so if you are following this video
03:14 - in the last video I have shown you how
03:15 - to delete your database
03:18 - using this delete button just double
03:21 - click it and copy all the code in
03:25 - between this
03:26 - function because we are going to use the
03:30 - same function of same code which we have
03:34 - written in
03:36 - this button delete click event or you
03:40 - can use any other code for example from
03:43 - this update click button event or your
03:46 - save click event and copy and paste your
03:50 - code from there to here so this code is
03:53 - like
03:54 - this we have declared this um database
03:59 - connection
04:00 - first so our database name is database.
04:03 - DB and version is three then we are
04:07 - creating a connect connection instance
04:10 - so I write escalet connection and give
04:13 - it a variable name is equal to new SQ
04:17 - connection and I passed this connection
04:20 - string here and then I have a TR catch
04:24 - block first and then I am open opening
04:29 - the connection with the escal database
04:33 - and here I declare a
04:36 - string in which I will pass the query so
04:40 - because in the last video we are
04:44 - deleting the database that's why we have
04:46 - written this query for deleting but in
04:50 - this video we will write a different
04:53 - query that we will see later and then we
04:58 - have this escalate command create
05:01 - command is equal to new skite command
05:03 - and we are passing our query and
05:04 - connection as argument
05:07 - here okay and then we are executing
05:10 - query and then we show the message that
05:14 - our query is executed in the delete case
05:17 - it's deleted so just copy
05:20 - this code from uh the last video and
05:24 - paste it here or other otherwise you can
05:28 - copy this code also
05:30 - and now we are going to make some
05:32 - changes so what changes we need we will
05:36 - delete this me message. show delete
05:40 - because we don't need it and we will
05:43 - comment this command. execute query
05:46 - because we also don't need it then we
05:50 - are going to change this query so
05:54 - instead of deleting
05:57 - database let me delete all all the all
06:01 - the query so I in the query I will
06:05 - write select
06:08 - star from my table name my table name is
06:13 - employee info if you can see here table
06:16 - name and in this table name I have
06:19 - column e ID name surname and age right
06:22 - so just remember that so I have written
06:25 - select star from employee ID here then I
06:31 - created the escolite
06:33 - command and in the next line I will make
06:37 - the escolite data reader so I
06:40 - write escal
06:43 - light data
06:46 - reader and I give it a variable name
06:49 - maybe
06:51 - Dr is equal to
06:55 - new not new
06:57 - but uh just copy this escolite command
07:02 - here to here
07:06 - dot execute
07:09 - reader bracket and bracket
07:12 - closed so
07:15 - it's reading the
07:18 - values from this query so it exe this
07:23 - data reader will execute this query and
07:26 - read the values in this data reader now
07:30 - we
07:31 - will make a while loop for reading all
07:34 - the values one by
07:36 - one
07:39 - while and bracket and bracket closed and
07:43 - in here in the while argument we will
07:46 - pass this Dr which is our DOA
07:50 - reader dot read so till this data reader
07:57 - reads the value we are executing our
08:02 - while loop okay and in here I will
08:06 - declare uh
08:09 - string and I want to save the name here
08:13 - so I will write name is equal to
08:19 - Dr
08:21 - dot
08:25 - get
08:27 - string bracket and bracket it
08:30 - closed and in here I will pass the
08:33 - column number of the column whose data I
08:38 - want so I want to show the name in my
08:42 - combo box right so my combo box for or
08:47 - or My column for com for the name is
08:52 - 01 so my column number is one if we were
08:57 - we wanted to to uh show the surname in
09:03 - the database we would have taken two
09:06 - because this is
09:08 - zeroth column First Column second column
09:11 - third column so in my get value argument
09:15 - I will pass one because this name is my
09:19 - first column okay I go to my code and I
09:23 - pass here dr. getet value 1 because I
09:27 - want the value from my First
09:31 - Column then I will go to my design view
09:37 - I will select my combo box I will copy
09:39 - the name of my combo box which is combo
09:42 - box
09:43 - one and once again go to my code section
09:47 - and below this uh string name I paste my
09:51 - combo box name
09:56 - dot
09:58 - items
10:00 - dot add bracket and bracket
10:04 - closed so this code will
10:08 - add one by one items to my combo box and
10:12 - what we are we want to add the this this
10:15 - name so just copy this string variable
10:18 - and paste it
10:21 - here okay so it will
10:25 - read the names one by one and it will
10:28 - set
10:29 - the names to the combo box one by one
10:33 - because we are executing this in the
10:35 - while
10:36 - loop okay so if you want you can just
10:40 - pause the video and copy this
10:43 - code let me make it little bit small so
10:48 - all code will come
10:50 - in the
10:52 - screen so just copy this code and what
10:57 - you need to do next is just copy the
11:00 - name of this function just copy it and
11:04 - go to
11:06 - the Constructor or the initialization of
11:11 - uh
11:13 - this this second window so wherever your
11:18 - initialized component function is there
11:20 - just search for this initialized
11:22 - component and just below this
11:25 - initialized component paste your fill
11:27 - combo function and close it so what it
11:32 - will do
11:33 - is whenever you run your program or
11:37 - whenever this window
11:39 - starts it automatically calls this
11:42 - function at the start of the your
11:46 - program so we it will call this function
11:50 - and it will fill the combo box with the
11:52 - names so let's see if it works or not I
11:56 - run the
11:57 - program
11:59 - and first of all I gave my username and
12:02 - password it's
12:05 - correct and it's showing me some syntax
12:10 - error let's see what syntax error I
12:21 - have so when I see my query here I would
12:26 - have written select star from
12:29 - and I have written form so I write from
12:33 - select star from my table name now it
12:36 - should work I
12:40 - think username and password and now my
12:44 - username and password is correct second
12:47 - form opens and when I click this or when
12:50 - I open this combo box it should show me
12:53 - my names from my name column yes it
12:58 - shows all all the names from my column
13:02 - name so let's confirm if these name are
13:06 - correct or not I go to my
13:09 - database
13:12 - here and I have this name Mark John
13:15 - Peter Julie and
13:17 - Matthew and here just
13:21 - see the names are the same Mark John
13:24 - Peter Julie Matthew here and here all
13:29 - names are same so it has loaded the
13:32 - names from the database to your combo
13:35 - box so I hope you have learned something
13:39 - new this time please wait comment and
13:41 - subscribe and bye for now
