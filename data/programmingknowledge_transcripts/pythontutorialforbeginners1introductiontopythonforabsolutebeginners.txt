00:00 - hey guys I welcome you all on this
00:02 - course on Python programming tutorial
00:04 - for beginners in this video I'm going to
00:06 - give you a brief introduction about
00:07 - Python so let's get started so first of
00:10 - all what is Python so Python is a
00:13 - high-level dynamically typed programming
00:17 - language pythons support multiple
00:20 - programming paradigms including
00:22 - object-oriented imperative functional
00:26 - and procedural styles
00:28 - now python is a interpreted language so
00:32 - what do we mean by interpreted to
00:35 - understand this we need to understand
00:37 - the difference between the compiled
00:39 - languages and the interpreted languages
00:42 - so some languages like C C++ Java are
00:46 - all translated by running the source
00:49 - code through a tool called compiler this
00:53 - compilation of source code results in a
00:56 - very efficient byte code that can be
00:58 - executed any number of times now
01:01 - interpreted languages like Python
01:03 - in contrast must be parsed interpreted
01:07 - and executed each time the program is
01:10 - run thereby greatly adding the cost of
01:14 - running the program so a compiled
01:16 - language takes the entire program as a
01:19 - single input and converts it into
01:22 - machine code or bytecode which is stored
01:25 - in a file called a binary file on the
01:28 - other hand interpreted languages like
01:31 - Python takes the signal instruction as
01:33 - single input and execute that
01:36 - instruction now compiled languages run
01:39 - faster because compilation is done
01:41 - before the execution on the other hand
01:44 - interpreted programs run slower because
01:47 - compilation and execution takes place
01:50 - simultaneously in case of Python even
01:53 - though it's an interpreted language but
01:55 - it's really fast now Python supports
01:58 - dynamic datatypes and to understand this
02:01 - we need to understand the difference
02:03 - between statically typed programming
02:05 - languages and dynamically typed
02:08 - programming languages
02:09 - so at statically typed programming
02:12 - language
02:13 - do the type checking at the compiled
02:15 - time as opposed to the real-time and
02:19 - dynamically typed programming languages
02:22 - do type checking at run time as opposed
02:26 - to compile time so let's say you declare
02:29 - a variable X is equal to nine in Python
02:32 - Python will do its type checking at run
02:35 - time whether it's an integer or a string
02:38 - or a double value all will be done at
02:41 - the run time now python is independent
02:44 - from platforms that means it's a
02:47 - cross-platform programming language that
02:50 - means you can run your Python code on
02:52 - Windows Linux Mac or on any other UNIX
02:56 - operating system now Python focuses on
02:59 - faster development time so Python code
03:02 - has a very natural style to it
03:04 - which makes it easy to read and
03:06 - understand thanks to the lack of
03:08 - semicolons and braces so we don't use
03:11 - semicolons or braces in Python that
03:14 - means faster development time especially
03:16 - when you are doing some prototyping work
03:19 - Python is a highly readable language and
03:22 - has a clean visual layout so if a
03:25 - developer writes a very efficient Python
03:28 - program it's like reading English
03:31 - language now Python have high-level
03:33 - internal object data types and have
03:36 - automatic memory management and at last
03:39 - Python is free and open source that
03:41 - means you don't need to pay anything to
03:44 - start learning Python now let's talk
03:46 - about some history about Python so
03:49 - Python was conceived in late 1980s and
03:54 - its implementation began in December
03:57 - 1989 by a developer called Guido van
04:01 - Rossum
04:01 - in Netherlands as a successor of a
04:05 - programming language called EBC now
04:07 - Guido van Rossum worked at Google from
04:11 - 2005 to December 2012 where he spent
04:15 - half of his time in the development of
04:17 - Python programming language and nowadays
04:19 - fun Rossum is working in a company
04:22 - called Dropbox and from where this
04:24 - Python name come from
04:27 - rusev chose the name peyten since he was
04:30 - a big fan of Monty Python's Flying
04:32 - Circus so Python was first publicly
04:35 - released in February 1991 and python.org
04:40 - II which is the official website of
04:43 - Python was released in the time period
04:45 - between 1996 and 1997 in the year 2001
04:50 - pythons Software Foundation was created
04:52 - and found resume remained the principal
04:56 - author of Python his continuing central
04:59 - role in Python development is reflected
05:02 - in the title given to him by Python
05:05 - community which is benevolent director
05:08 - of life now what is a benevolent
05:10 - director of life this is a title given
05:13 - to small number of open-source software
05:15 - development leaders typically the
05:18 - project founders who retain the final
05:21 - say in the dispute or arguments within
05:25 - the community so why learn Python
05:27 - because python is fun to use scripting
05:31 - language and as I said python is a
05:33 - multi-paradigm programming language
05:36 - which supports object-oriented
05:38 - imperative functional programming and
05:40 - procedural styles that means it's highly
05:44 - recommended for the educational purpose
05:47 - so majority of educational institutes
05:49 - use Python as the first language which
05:53 - they teach to their students and why
05:55 - it's the first choice of educational
05:58 - institutes because it's very easy to
06:00 - learn and it runs on any platform now
06:03 - Python is very powerful scalable and
06:06 - easy to maintain programming language
06:09 - which enables high productivity and it
06:11 - has lots and lots of inbuilt libraries
06:14 - which our developer can use Python is
06:16 - also used as a glue language which acts
06:19 - as our interactive front-end for the
06:21 - languages like C and C++ so when you
06:24 - develop in Python it reduces the
06:26 - development time it reduces the code
06:29 - length it is easy to learn and use as a
06:32 - developer it is easy to understand codes
06:36 - it is easy to do team projects in Python
06:39 - and it's way
06:40 - easy to extend to other languages if you
06:43 - are using Python so where can you use
06:45 - Python so because python is a
06:48 - general-purpose programming language it
06:51 - is used in many web development
06:53 - framework for example django and flask
06:56 - recently became very popular for web
06:59 - development
07:00 - now python is also widely used in
07:03 - scientific computing data mining and
07:06 - machine learning and continued growth
07:09 - and demand for machine learning
07:11 - developers may be driving the popularity
07:14 - of Python now as I said Python is used
07:18 - as a scripting language that means if
07:21 - you are doing prototyping it's really
07:24 - efficient to use Python Python is also
07:27 - used in the development of graphical
07:29 - user interfaces embedded applications
07:32 - gave me and DevOps tools and at last as
07:36 - I said because Python is really easy to
07:40 - learn it's used for educational purposes
07:43 - as the first programming language for
07:46 - teaching programming now the question
07:49 - arises which version of Python should
07:51 - you learn Python 3 or Python 2 so I
07:54 - would recommend Python 3 since it's more
07:58 - modern and it is a more popular option
08:01 - at this point of time so I will be
08:04 - teaching this course in Python 3 so this
08:07 - was a brief introduction about Python
08:09 - from the next video I'm going to show
08:11 - you how to install Python and how to use
08:14 - Python as a programming language so stay
08:17 - tuned for the next video and bye for now
