00:00 - so what i've done now and i have created
00:02 - a landing.html.erb
00:05 - so this is the landing page of the
00:06 - application
00:08 - so this is the landing page and it says
00:11 - landing page
00:12 - to check login or
00:16 - log out so simply it is the landing page
00:19 - to check login or log out
00:20 - and let's this is the uh this is the
00:24 - feature landing page to check login or
00:26 - logout so let's
00:28 - exit this facebook console and uh
00:31 - let's clear this so now we need to
00:35 - define in dot short rp
00:37 - we need to define get log out
00:41 - because now this is the last feature we
00:43 - are building get lockout
00:44 - and then we will test our application to
00:46 - define
00:47 - sessions hash destroy
00:53 - as logout
00:59 - so this is session.destroy as the whole
01:02 - so now let's move to session controller
01:04 - okay what happens
01:06 - when we make a session so what happens
01:08 - let's i'll show you
01:11 - okay so one thing i
01:14 - uh like one thing i'll show you one
01:17 - thing uh
01:18 - uh see so what happens when
01:22 - the user authentication is successful
01:25 - so if the user's authentication is
01:28 - successful
01:29 - so we what we do
01:33 - we do session
01:36 - of user id
01:40 - equal to user dot id okay
01:44 - now this is what happens when we
01:47 - see the like we see that the user has
01:50 - successfully logged in so we create a
01:52 - user id and assign that user.id
01:55 - what destroy what we do we do the
01:57 - opposite of this
01:58 - so okay we do the opposite of this that
02:01 - instead of
02:01 - assigning it id we assign it as a nail
02:04 - value
02:05 - okay so this is what we do
02:09 - and this is this happens okay uh
02:13 - yeah then uh uh
02:17 - we like this is we do and uh then we
02:20 - create a helper method and uh
02:22 - application controller dot this is the
02:25 - application controller
02:27 - so we create a help method in this
02:30 - and how do we define this we define
02:34 - a helper method helper underscope method
02:40 - uh which says current underscore user so
02:42 - basically in most of the rails
02:43 - application we
02:44 - use that access the current user using
02:46 - this and if undefined
02:51 - find trend underscore user
02:55 - and we define end so
02:59 - session of user id
03:02 - that is not nil okay if that is not nil
03:06 - then we define current underscore user
03:10 - is equal to correct current control user
03:13 - or
03:13 - user dot find blue dot find
03:19 - session or user id
03:25 - else current underscore user is equal to
03:28 - name
03:29 - right so this is we do it so
03:33 - that exists if session id is exist
03:35 - didn't we find the current user
03:37 - then either then we do put that current
03:40 - user to net
03:42 - okay so if
03:45 - if in this page which say
03:50 - if and underscope user
03:56 - you can underscore user then we say
04:00 - and we say
04:05 - hello hello
04:10 - your current underscore dot email
04:14 - it exists then we say this okay
04:19 - else else
04:23 - we need to show user that they are
04:26 - like okay let's first check this
04:30 - we are in session controller then we a
04:32 - time session is able to use the dot id
04:34 - and then we say
04:35 - render
04:40 - layouts
04:42 - flash landing
04:46 - okay okay uh one thing we all
04:50 - like missed in this is uh
04:54 - like uh that is layouts understanding so
04:56 - one thing i would like to tell you
04:58 - we can also render different layouts
05:02 - uh from here by defining the prefix so
05:05 - if we don't define the prefix then it
05:07 - assumes and we are defining the
05:09 - sessions then it assumes we are in
05:10 - sessions and users the end users
05:12 - so if we can define the process for this
05:15 - so let's
05:16 - run the application sign
05:19 - in okay says
05:23 - unexpected error okay yeah because this
05:25 - is uh
05:26 - ruby so yes
05:30 - else and when we end this block
05:33 - like this fine
05:36 - so let's make again
05:41 - let's log in this and let's create so
05:44 - it's it
05:45 - and landing page to check login or
05:47 - logout hello dummy.com we are perfectly
05:50 - fine
05:51 - so now we on this page we need to create
05:54 - an option to block out if it's if it's
05:57 - if it
05:58 - is signed in okay a hrf
06:05 - and we say
06:11 - log out
06:15 - and for that i told you for if you want
06:18 - to check the confirm the
06:20 - path so what you can do you can simply
06:23 - type this
06:23 - log out and it says logo underscore path
06:27 - perfectly fine so this is logger
06:31 - underscore path and
06:32 - here we go and it says so let's again
06:37 - move to this page okay
06:40 - uh let's do move to sign in okay let's
06:43 - create a different route for this okay
06:46 - let's get to this
06:50 - it slash
06:54 - landing and let's
07:00 - do
07:02 - users hash landing we will create this
07:07 - and so let's
07:10 - create this as
07:13 - landing okay so let's move to user
07:17 - controller let's create this because
07:19 - we don't need to sign this every time to
07:21 - get into this method
07:23 - define landing and then simply render
07:28 - layouts a out
07:34 - dash landing okay
07:39 - and yeah
07:42 - so yeah yeah that is an error because
07:46 - we need to define this in codes
07:51 - so like that is an error now let's uh
07:54 - check for the landing round
07:56 - yeah this is slash landing so let's move
07:58 - to this route
08:02 - so yeah it still stays uh when we move
08:05 - to the landing page to check login our
08:06 - hello address let's move to logo
08:08 - so when we move to hit the logo button
08:11 - so
08:12 - we need to destroy the session and we
08:14 - already do that
08:16 - nothing and then we say render
08:19 - this thing or
08:23 - instead of doing render render again
08:24 - again we can
08:26 - simply use redirect 2 because we have
08:28 - already created the route for that
08:30 - yeah supposedly fine we can do redirect
08:34 - redirect underscore to
08:40 - log code underscore
08:43 - i hope this is fine here
08:47 - yeah fine so let's repair this
08:50 - regular logout and here
08:54 - it hits the button and there is a logo
08:57 - the sum seems an error with this
09:02 - okay three zero to form
09:08 - okay seem some error with this
09:17 - so let me check the route for this
09:27 - okay i did a mistake uh i had to render
09:30 - to landing path sorry
09:32 - this was a mistake yeah
09:37 - so let's say redirect
09:40 - to landing in
09:48 - yeah description
09:54 - so let's move to landing page
10:00 - okay to connect it something seems
10:04 - wrong with the server
10:09 - now it's fine so landing page to check
10:12 - login and log out yeah
10:13 - it is not logged in because last at last
10:15 - you had created enjoy the session
10:17 - so let's create a user from uh like that
10:20 - you assign it
10:21 - with moodle.com and let's sign in with
10:24 - the user
10:27 - it says hello android developer let's do
10:29 - a logout and we are logged out so
10:31 - perfectly fine
10:32 - when we are logged out we don't see
10:33 - anything okay so
10:36 - so for that we can create a message if
10:38 - this is the current user then we do this
10:40 - else else
10:44 - we can show
10:48 - else we can show uh the one we had on
10:52 - the
