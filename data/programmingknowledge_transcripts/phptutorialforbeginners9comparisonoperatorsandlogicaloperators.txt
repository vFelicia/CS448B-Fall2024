00:01 - hello guys in the last video we have
00:03 - seen how to use if statement if El
00:05 - statement and nested if El statement in
00:08 - your PHP script right now in this video
00:12 - I'm going to show you how you can use
00:15 - some of the comparison operator and The
00:19 - Logical operators using this if
00:23 - condition or in this if statement so
00:26 - I've shown you the basic skeleton of
00:29 - this if state m is like this let's see
00:31 - what are the conditional operators or
00:34 - conditional uh comparison operation and
00:38 - The Logical operators we can use with
00:41 - this if so these are some of the
00:44 - comparison operators you can use with
00:47 - the if statement in the last video I've
00:49 - shown you how to use this so if a is one
00:52 - variable and b is another variable you
00:55 - can compare the equality of those two
00:58 - variable like uh this you can just give
01:01 - two equal sign and it will check whether
01:06 - these two variables are equal or not but
01:08 - there is one more uh uh operator which
01:12 - is triple equal to which also checks the
01:15 - equality of these two two variables but
01:20 - it also checks whether they are of same
01:23 - type or not so it it checks the equality
01:27 - plus the type type of your variable so
01:32 - for example I have these two variables
01:35 - number one which is a string but the
01:38 - value of the string is 10 and number two
01:41 - which is
01:42 - also variable but uh which is
01:45 - initialized by number ter so this is a
01:48 - numerical variable and this is a a
01:51 - string variable right because it's in
01:54 - single quotation and for example I want
01:57 - to uh check the equality of of these two
02:02 - variables I can check it like this and I
02:06 - can
02:07 - Echo if they are equal I can just uh
02:14 - print equal right and
02:19 - else else I can
02:22 - print not equal okay so I can say not
02:28 - equal so in whenever you use this double
02:32 - equal to sign let's see what happens I
02:35 - will save the program and go to PA and
02:39 - it says
02:41 - equal right but logically they are not
02:44 - equal one is a string and other is a a
02:47 - number but what PHP is doing it's uh
02:50 - taking the value for this which is 10
02:55 - and it's taking the value of this and
02:57 - compare compare it because we not
03:00 - checking the type of your variable using
03:03 - double equal to right now on the other
03:06 - hand if you use Tri triple equal to it
03:08 - will also check the type of your
03:12 - variables and then when when you run the
03:14 - program or when you just use it you can
03:18 - see not equal to so this triple equal to
03:22 - will compare the type as well as the
03:24 - equality on the other hand this double
03:27 - equal to only checks the value what ever
03:30 - inside your variable is right
03:33 - now there are some other comparison
03:36 - variabl which which are like this if you
03:39 - want to compare that if whether two
03:44 - values inside your variables differ or
03:46 - not or not equal then you can just give
03:49 - this uh symbol not equal to like
03:53 - this you can just give
03:57 - not equal to Okay so it will check
04:01 - non-equality okay and there's one more
04:05 - uh symbol you can give here is are these
04:08 - greater than and smaller than sign which
04:10 - will also check the non-equality so if
04:13 - you give this symbol
04:16 - also it will also check the non-quality
04:19 - of these two numbers so I will run this
04:23 - it will not give any error here
04:27 - right okay and this this is less than
04:31 - sign so it will compare the less than
04:34 - and it will compare the greater than and
04:37 - here you can also check
04:39 - nonidentical so similarly it will work
04:42 - like this if you use triple equals it
04:44 - will uh check the type and equality if
04:48 - you give this non equal sign and double
04:51 - equals after that then it'll check for
04:55 - the
04:56 - nonidentical types so it will check for
04:58 - the equality and it will CH check for
05:00 - the same type also right you can also
05:04 - give this less than or equal to sign
05:07 - like this and greater than or equal to
05:09 - sign like this in your comparison like
05:13 - this less than equal to or greater than
05:17 - equal to right like this and it will
05:21 - also work now let's see some of the
05:24 - logical operators which we can use in
05:26 - PHP with our conditions these are called
05:30 - logical operations and what are logical
05:33 - operation it it logical operations are
05:38 - based on some conditions so for example
05:42 - a is a value and B is also one
05:47 - value and a and b can uh A and B both
05:53 - are true in that case uh this operation
05:57 - will be executed so so let's see how we
06:01 - can do uh or perform these logical
06:04 - operations so in here number one is uh
06:09 - for example 20 and number two is
06:13 - uh 10 so I can check whether a number
06:18 - one is greater than or equal to number
06:21 - two
06:23 - and and number two for example like this
06:29 - you can check it like this number one is
06:32 - greater than than number two or and
06:36 - number one equal to number two right not
06:40 - this one but equal to this one okay so
06:45 - it will check both the conditions there
06:48 - this is one condition and this is second
06:50 - condition and it's always better to
06:53 - whenever you have multiple condition use
06:56 - this brackets so that you can easily
07:00 - identify these two conditions okay so
07:03 - this and symbol will wait for both the
07:07 - condition to be true this condition has
07:09 - to be true and this condition has to be
07:11 - true only then it will show this equals
07:14 - to sign or equals to string otherwise it
07:17 - will show non equal to right so in this
07:22 - case this will show non equal to because
07:26 - number one is greater than number two
07:28 - but number one is not equal to number
07:30 - two so it will show us this result right
07:34 - let's see it will show you as this
07:38 - result but for example we are checking
07:42 - for number one is equal to number
07:47 - two and for example here also we can
07:51 - check for the same
07:53 - condition okay and we can here write
07:58 - 10 and we can check these condition
08:02 - number one is identical to number two
08:05 - and number one is equal to number two
08:08 - and when we run it it will give us equal
08:10 - to right these are some logical
08:13 - operators and and you can use it like
08:16 - this A and D or double and symbol like
08:21 - this both will be valid in a same way it
08:23 - will check for or so or one of the
08:27 - condition is true so and you use this or
08:31 - sign here your if condition will wait
08:34 - for only one condition to be true and if
08:37 - only one out of two condition is true it
08:40 - will give the result okay so there is
08:44 - and operator and or logical operator and
08:48 - there's third operator called XR
08:51 - operator and it will check for
08:54 - either or both conditions are not true
09:01 - okay so it'll basically checks for one
09:06 - of the condition to be true but not both
09:10 - at the same time okay so this is a XR
09:15 - operation and this when you use the not
09:19 - it's
09:21 - just checks for the non equality okay so
09:25 - it will check if uh the value of this is
09:28 - not true true so these are some of the
09:31 - comparison operator and logical operator
09:33 - you can use with your if condition or
09:36 - else uh in some other cases wherever you
09:41 - need to compare or perform some logical
09:44 - operations in PHP I hope you have
09:47 - enjoyed this video please RIT comment
09:49 - and subscribe and bye for now
