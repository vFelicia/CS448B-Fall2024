00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - MongoDB database tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in the last video we have seen how we
00:06 - can create a database and drop a
00:09 - database using MongoDB and chef
00:12 - tool right in this video we will see how
00:15 - we can create a collection and how we
00:19 - can drop a collection in MongoDB so
00:23 - let's get started we will start by
00:25 - creating a new database which I am going
00:28 - to name it as my DB because if you
00:31 - remember in the last video I have shown
00:33 - you how to drop a database and in that
00:35 - process we have already dropped our
00:37 - database and I will press this button
00:39 - and it's going to create the database
00:42 - and it will switch the current database
00:44 - to my DB now to create a collection you
00:48 - need to use this command we have several
00:52 - commands to create a collection the
00:54 - first is DB dot create collection ok so
00:59 - just write DB dot create collection and
01:02 - if you can see here in the intellisense
01:05 - this create collection takes two
01:08 - argument one is the name of the
01:10 - collection and other is the options but
01:14 - for now we are only going to use the
01:16 - name the options we are going to see a
01:19 - little bit later right so just give the
01:22 - name of your collection for example my
01:27 - collection and then close the bracket
01:30 - and execute this query that says ok 1 so
01:36 - that means our collection is created
01:40 - right now to see the collection you just
01:44 - need to write show
01:47 - collections and just execute it and you
01:52 - can see right now we have one collection
01:54 - named my collection in the current
01:57 - database right now the second way of
02:01 - creating a collection is we have seen in
02:05 - the last video so we can create a
02:07 - collection for example I want to create
02:09 - a collection and the name of the
02:12 - collection are one to give as for
02:15 - example my collection or my collection -
02:19 - okay so my collection - and then dot
02:23 - insert and in the insert we have seen in
02:29 - the last video we can give a jason in a
02:32 - key value pair for example for example
02:35 - once again the name and the value of the
02:39 - name for example some name max okay and
02:43 - execute the query and it's executed
02:47 - successfully and we are going to give
02:50 - the query show collections once again
02:53 - and it gives my collection and my
02:55 - collection - so now we have two
02:58 - collections right now this query or this
03:03 - command what is going to do is is going
03:05 - to create the collection if the
03:08 - collection is not present and if the
03:11 - collection is already present then it's
03:13 - going to use that collection and then
03:16 - insert this document in that collection
03:19 - right so if it's not present created if
03:22 - it's present then insert into it right
03:26 - now
03:27 - to drop a collection what we need to do
03:31 - is we need to use once again at this DB
03:34 - command and then your collection name
03:37 - for example we want to drop our first
03:40 - collection which is called my collection
03:42 - and then you give this command dot drop
03:45 - so just write dot drop and it's going to
03:49 - drop this collection so let's
03:52 - hit this query and then it says true
03:56 - which means that our command is
03:58 - successful and then once again we will
04:01 - just show the collections and now we
04:04 - have only one collection right and if
04:07 - you want to remove this collection also
04:10 - you can just give the command once again
04:13 - T V dot my collection - which is the
04:16 - name of second collection not drop and
04:18 - execute this command and it says true
04:21 - once again you
04:24 - give the shoe collection commands and
04:27 - now we have new collections so in this
04:30 - way you can create collection and drop
04:33 - collection in MongoDB I hope you've
