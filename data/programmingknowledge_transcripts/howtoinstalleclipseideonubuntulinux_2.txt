00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and
00:04 - install and use eclipse ide
00:07 - on your ubuntu operating system
00:10 - so let's get started so before
00:12 - installing eclipse ide
00:14 - the prerequisite of installing eclipse
00:16 - is
00:17 - you need to have java installed on your
00:20 - ubuntu operating system
00:22 - so i have already created a video about
00:24 - how you can install
00:25 - java jdk on your ubuntu operating system
00:28 - and i will put the link in the
00:30 - description of this video
00:32 - so you can just see how you can install
00:35 - java on your ubuntu operating system if
00:37 - you
00:37 - already don't have java now in order to
00:41 - check
00:41 - the version of java you can just press
00:43 - ctrl alt t to open the terminal here
00:46 - and once the terminal is open you can
00:48 - just give this command java hyphen
00:50 - hyphen
00:52 - version and it's going to give you the
00:54 - version
00:55 - of java you have on your ubuntu
00:58 - operating system so in my case i have
00:59 - java 15.0.2 version
01:03 - so once you have java installed on your
01:05 - ubuntu operating system
01:06 - we are ready to install eclipse so just
01:08 - open your favorite browser and search
01:10 - for download eclipse
01:12 - and the first link which will appear
01:13 - here will be from eclipse.org forward
01:16 - slash downloads
01:18 - so i'm going to just click on this link
01:21 - and
01:22 - when you reach to this website straight
01:24 - away and you scroll down you will be
01:26 - able to see this
01:28 - download eclipse button so i'm going to
01:30 - just click on the download
01:31 - button here and then you will be able to
01:35 - see the nearest
01:36 - mirror which is nearer to
01:40 - your location i'm going to just click on
01:42 - download button which is going to start
01:44 - the download
01:45 - of this eclipse ide on my
01:49 - ubuntu operating system so you can see
01:52 - it's around
01:53 - 83 megabyte file so i will wait for the
01:55 - download to complete
01:57 - so once this eclipse tar dot gz file is
02:01 - downloaded i'm going to just
02:02 - minimize my browser and i'm going to
02:05 - open
02:06 - my terminal once again so now
02:09 - i'm going to just navigate to my uh
02:12 - downloads folder
02:13 - and you can see this eclipse star dot
02:16 - gz file is here so if you are
02:19 - comfortable
02:20 - with command line then you can give this
02:24 - tar command and then hyphen xv
02:28 - zf and then the name of your file which
02:31 - is eclipse
02:32 - or you can directly go to the downloads
02:34 - file and then right click on this file
02:37 - and then you can just click on extract
02:40 - here which is going to extract
02:41 - this file into your downloads folder
02:44 - okay so i'm going to just
02:45 - give this command and now you will be
02:48 - able to see
02:50 - that this folder is extracted
02:53 - from your eclipse dot gz file
02:56 - and now uh inside this eclipse folder i
03:00 - can see this
03:00 - eclipse hyphen inst file
03:04 - so i can run this binary file
03:08 - using the terminal also or you can
03:10 - directly uh click
03:11 - on this file so let me clear the
03:13 - terminal and then
03:15 - i need to navigate to the eclipse
03:18 - directory
03:19 - and here i need to run this file
03:22 - right so i'm going to just write dot
03:25 - forward slash
03:26 - name of the file which is eclipse hyphen
03:29 - inst
03:30 - and then press enter and it's going to
03:33 - start
03:34 - this graphical installer setup
03:39 - so let me just minimize all my
03:42 - terminals so now you have a bunch of
03:45 - options here so if you want to install
03:48 - eclipse for
03:49 - the java development you can choose the
03:51 - first option
03:52 - if you want to install java for other
03:55 - purposes
03:56 - for for example for developing c plus
03:59 - applications or php applications
04:02 - or other applications you can choose the
04:04 - option which
04:06 - is suitable for you for now i am going
04:08 - to choose the first option
04:10 - which is for java developers and
04:13 - this will be the location of your
04:16 - java jdk file so eclipse is going to
04:19 - recognize the location of your
04:21 - java j vm jdk directory
04:25 - where you have already installed java
04:28 - right so if you are happy with both the
04:31 - paths then just click on the install
04:34 - button
04:34 - which is going to give you this kind of
04:38 - license terms and agreement a window so
04:42 - you can just click on accept now and the
04:45 - installation
04:46 - will start so i will wait for the
04:49 - installation to complete
04:51 - so now as you can see the eclipse
04:53 - installation is finished
04:55 - on my ubuntu operating system so i'm
04:57 - going to just click on this
04:58 - launch button to launch eclipse ide
05:02 - and for the first time when you open
05:04 - eclipse
05:05 - it will ask you to provide the workspace
05:08 - folder so if you don't have the good
05:10 - reason to change this path
05:12 - you can leave it as default and then
05:14 - click on
05:15 - launch and now the eclipse ide has been
05:17 - started
05:18 - on your ubuntu operating system so now
05:21 - at this point
05:22 - you can create your first java project
05:26 - so let's create one so i'm going to just
05:28 - click on
05:29 - file and then new and then click on

05:44 - where
05:45 - your project will be saved and then you
05:48 - can choose your

05:54 - recognize your java installation and
05:56 - it's going to
05:57 - just select these options automatically
06:00 - you can also choose the different
