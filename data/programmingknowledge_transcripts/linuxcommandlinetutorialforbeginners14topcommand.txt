00:00 - I know guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line troll for beginners
00:04 - in this video we will see how we can use
00:06 - top command in Linux
00:09 - now top command provides a dynamic
00:12 - real-time view of your running system so
00:16 - for example you want to know which
00:19 - process in your computer is taking most
00:24 - of the or your CPU or which program is
00:28 - taking most of your computer memory then
00:33 - you can use a top command to see which
00:36 - program or which process is you know
00:40 - consuming most of your memory or CPU so
00:45 - let's see how we can use it so just give
00:49 - t.o.p command and press Enter
00:52 - and now you can see it's going to give
00:56 - you this kind of a list view and you can
01:00 - see it's refreshing every few seconds so
01:04 - this is the time which is the current
01:07 - time and for example you can see right
01:10 - now it's refreshing every three seconds
01:13 - so 36 and then it will be 39 and then
01:17 - once again 42 so it's refreshing every
01:20 - three second by default the stop command
01:23 - refreshes this view every three seconds
01:27 - right now
01:28 - on the left hand side you will be able
01:32 - to see the PID a PID stands for process
01:37 - ID in Linux every program or process
01:43 - have its own ID and this is called
01:46 - process ID in Linux and in short it's
01:50 - called PID so you can see on the right
01:54 - hand side the name of the program which
01:56 - is running currently and taking some
02:00 - memory on your computer so this is the
02:03 - zorg or genome terminal which is auto
02:07 - or D which is a daemon
02:10 - which is running on my computer or even
02:12 - the stop command how much memory is is
02:16 - it taking now in here you can see the
02:20 - CPU usage so the most of the CPU which
02:24 - is 5.9 or it's changing dynamically
02:28 - right so 4% it's used by the zorg
02:33 - process right and most of the memory
02:36 - also is used by the zorg
02:39 - process right so in this way you can see
02:43 - or take an overview of processes which
02:47 - processes are taking a memory or how
02:50 - much memory is used in your system or
02:54 - how much CPU is used in your system so
02:58 - you can see right not total CPU usage is
03:03 - for example 8.2 or 7.5% or how much
03:07 - percent is it okay now
03:12 - top command provides you some more you
03:15 - know
03:16 - capabilities or flags you can say in
03:20 - order to you know use this top in a
03:23 - better way now as I told you by default
03:27 - this view will be refreshed after every
03:31 - 3 3 seconds and this you can verify with
03:35 - this clock so 58 and then b1 so for 3
03:40 - seconds if you want to change this
03:43 - refreshing of the data then you just
03:46 - need to press S on this terminal so just
03:50 - press s and then you can see here it
03:54 - says change delay from 3 to whatever
03:57 - second you want so for example I want to
04:00 - you know see the proc you processes
04:04 - frequently or I want to refresh this top
04:08 - frequently for example 4
04:10 - every one second so I will just give one
04:13 - here and press enter and now this will
04:16 - be refreshed this view will be refreshed
04:18 - every second and you can verify it with
04:21 - this clock also so 45 46 47 so it's
04:25 - refreshing faster and for example I want
04:28 - to do it little bit slower so I can do
04:30 - it five here and press enter and now
04:33 - this view will be refreshed every five
04:36 - seconds right so 56 and then one and
04:39 - hopefully it will be six here on the
04:42 - clock you can see like this okay now for
04:46 - example whenever you press I so just
04:50 - press a key I and this key allows you to
04:56 - just filter out any idle processes so if
05:01 - any process is idle it will not be shown
05:04 - here whatever process are running here
05:07 - only those processes will be shown all
05:10 - other idle processes will not be shown
05:13 - or filtered right so these are the only
05:17 - processes which are taking some CPU or
05:20 - memories so that's why these are shown
05:22 - otherwise all idle processes are not
05:25 - shown and once again when you press I
05:27 - that is going to show you the complete
05:31 - view all the processes which are running
05:33 - right now next thing here what we can do
05:39 - is we can even kill a process for
05:44 - example so what I'm going to do is for
05:46 - example I will press this button here
05:49 - and I will open for example system
05:53 - settings from here when I do this on my
05:57 - top come on you can see unity control C
06:01 - is running and when I press I so it will
06:06 - just give me the overview of the running
06:09 - processes right so when I do some
06:13 - you know some clicks here I will be able
06:16 - to see the process which process is for
06:20 - which you know what is doing what so
06:23 - this when I press and I can see here
06:27 - this process is 3 8 7 3 for example
06:33 - right so process ID according to the
06:35 - process ID I can kill any process so
06:38 - once again I will press it and then I
06:41 - can see this unity ctrl C command the
06:44 - process ID is 3/8 R 3 7 I think what 3 8
06:49 - 7 3 it was let me confirm yeah 3 at 7 3
06:53 - so when I press on this terminal K it
06:58 - can ask me the process ID so I know the
07:02 - process ID which I want to kill so I
07:04 - will just say 3 8 7 3 and then I will
07:08 - press ENTER and once again I will press
07:11 - ENTER which is going to kill the process
07:15 - which I want to kill using the process
07:19 - ID so now the settings window is gone
07:23 - because I killed this window right so in
07:27 - this way you can kill any process in
07:31 - Linux now process ID and what are
07:35 - processes and how to kill the processes
07:38 - we will see in details later also but I
07:42 - just wanted to show you the
07:44 - functionality of topsail that you know
07:47 - how it works so in this way you can use
07:50 - top command in Linux and whenever you
07:54 - want to quit top you just need to press
07:57 - Q and you are out of this top command
08:00 - so I hope you enjoyed this video please
