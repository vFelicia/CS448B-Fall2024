00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:03 - Java programming tutorial for beginners
00:05 - in this video we will see how to use
00:08 - date class in
00:10 - Java date class we can use to display
00:15 - date and time and manipulate date and
00:18 - time in Java in addition we will also
00:21 - see how we can format date and time in
00:25 - Java so first of all to uh add this dat
00:30 - and time class we need to import this
00:33 - class from a package called java. utils
00:37 - so just
00:38 - [Music]
00:39 - import Java do
00:44 - u.d okay and after importing this class
00:47 - you can create an object of this date
00:50 - class like this date is equal to
00:55 - new date and you can use this date
00:59 - object to print the current date and
01:02 - time for example and how you can print
01:05 - current date and time you just need to
01:08 - use for example sis out and you just
01:11 - take this date object from here and call
01:16 - a method called two string on it so just
01:20 - call two string okay and I will save
01:24 - this program and I'm going to run
01:27 - this and it's going to to give me the
01:31 - current date and time so when I see this
01:35 - it's going to give me this date and time
01:38 - okay so it's printing the day today is
01:41 - Tuesday June 23 and the time okay and uh
01:48 - it's going to print the year and full
01:51 - date and time like this okay so this is
01:53 - the default datee and time it's
01:56 - printing now there is a term called
02:00 - Epoch time Epoch time if you don't know
02:04 - it's a time from
02:07 - 1970 1st January
02:09 - 1970 and this is the number of
02:13 - milliseconds from 1st January 1970 so
02:18 - this is the reference time we take in
02:21 - order to you know use time so to print
02:26 - this Epoch time in millisecond what you
02:29 - can do is you just need to write sis out
02:33 - and use this date once again and call
02:38 - get time okay so just call get time on
02:42 - it and it will give you the number of
02:45 - Mill seconds from 1st January 1970 so
02:50 - let's save it first and run it once
02:53 - again and it's giving us the number of
02:56 - milliseconds right now suppose you want
03:00 - a particular day or month or year from
03:04 - this uh current date for example so how
03:08 - you can get it you can get it something
03:11 - like this so once again I'm going to use
03:13 - CIS out to print it and on this date
03:17 - object when you do this Dot and you can
03:21 - see get month get year and get date so
03:28 - there are different uh method you can
03:30 - call on this date to get different kind
03:35 - of uh you know uh date time or month so
03:39 - for example I want to know the current
03:42 - month or print the current month right
03:44 - now so I will use this get
03:47 - month and this when I save it and run it
03:52 - it's going to give me the current month
03:55 - but remember when it gives you the
03:58 - current month you need to add one to it
04:01 - because this prints the current month
04:04 - from zero okay so for example January it
04:08 - will print the current month is equal to
04:10 - zero February current month is equal to
04:14 - 1 so it starts from zero not one okay in
04:17 - the same way you can uh call multiple
04:21 - methods
04:26 - like and save the program and run it it
04:30 - and it's going to give you the get year
04:34 - so right now it's
04:37 - 2015 okay and you need to add
04:41 - 1,900 to it in order to uh print the you
04:46 - know 2015 value and day for example day
04:51 - it's going to give you the day of the
04:54 - week so today is Tuesday so it's giving
04:57 - me two because it the week start from
05:00 - Monday and Monday is equal to 1 and
05:03 - Tuesday is equal to 2 okay in the same
05:06 - way you can print uh uh hour seconds and
05:10 - time also okay so there are some method
05:14 - for example you want to print current
05:18 - hour so just get and just call our get
05:24 - hour on it okay so let's search for get
05:28 - hour and Save save the program and run
05:31 - it and it's giving me
05:34 - 23 because right now uh the time is 23
05:39 - 38 49 you can see here okay so just play
05:45 - with this object and uh see what you
05:48 - want and you will be able to get it okay
05:52 - and for this year you just need to add
05:56 - 1900 to print the current correct year
06:00 - save it and for the month you just need
06:03 - to add + one to it okay save it and run
06:08 - it and it's going to print 2015 and
06:12 - month is six okay because this is
06:16 - June now for example you want to print
06:20 - the date and time but in different
06:23 - format so you want your customized
06:27 - format to print the time so how you can
06:30 - do it so for that we just need to
06:33 - include one more class which is import
06:37 - java. text okay and then we will use a
06:44 - class called Simple date format okay and
06:51 - for example SDF I'm going to give the
06:54 - name to the object is equal to new
06:58 - simple date format and in the
07:02 - Constructor it takes the format in which
07:05 - you want to print the date okay so first
07:10 - of all what format we can give here so
07:15 - first of all just copy this class simple
07:18 - date format and open your favorite
07:20 - browser and search for it and the first
07:23 - link most probably will come from
07:25 - oracle.com and the search result will be
07:29 - simple date format okay and in this page
07:34 - you will be able to see different
07:36 - formats so whenever you use y it will
07:39 - print year whenever you use uh m capital
07:43 - M it will uh print the month in year
07:47 - whenever you use week it will print week
07:49 - in year so from here you can take the
07:53 - reference which letter stands for what
07:56 - okay so first of all we are going to
07:59 - take this e letter to print their name
08:03 - in week okay so let's take e and then
08:08 - for example we want to print year so
08:11 - what we can do we can just print y y y y
08:17 - and why we are doing this because we
08:20 - want to print for example 2012 or
08:24 - 2015 then we uh need to use four times
08:28 - this these y okay and then you want a
08:32 - dash or slash to separate month and year
08:37 - and for month we can see capital M so
08:41 - double M for month and then for day we
08:45 - can use D small D you can see here small
08:50 - D is the day in month in the same way
08:52 - you can use Capital H for hour and small
08:56 - s for second so let's print the time
09:00 - so we want to print our then let's
09:04 - separate it by colon and this is your
09:10 - customizable uh you know letter okay so
09:13 - it will print as it is if you want
09:16 - instead of uh colon you need slash or
09:19 - you need minus or whatever letter you
09:23 - need you can do it so let's uh do it
09:25 - with minus okay and then small M which
09:29 - will print minute and then small s which
09:32 - will print seconds and after this you
09:36 - can use this SDF object and call a
09:40 - method called format okay so I'm going
09:44 - to just write sis out and then use
09:48 - SDF dot
09:51 - format okay and give your date object
09:55 - here so just copy this date object and
09:57 - give it here and Save the program and
10:00 - run the program and you can see it's
10:03 - giving us our customizable date okay so
10:08 - it's printing 2015 which comes from here
10:11 - Tuesday which comes from this e 06 which
10:14 - comes from this double M 23 which comes
10:18 - from here and the other from here minute
10:24 - and seconds okay so for reference you
10:27 - can go to this Oracle website site and
10:30 - see uh all the formats you may use okay
10:35 - so in this way you can use date and time
10:38 - and format date and time according to
10:40 - your requirement in Java I hope you
