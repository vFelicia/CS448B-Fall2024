00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - open CV t-told so beginners using Python
00:05 - in this video we will talk about track
00:07 - bars in open CV our track bars are
00:11 - really useful whenever you want to
00:13 - change some value in your image
00:15 - dynamically at runtime so let's see how
00:19 - we can use track bars in open CV now to
00:23 - start with I have this simple code which
00:26 - you might know what it does so first of
00:29 - all I have imported CV to as a CV and
00:32 - then I'm creating an image using the
00:35 - numpy zeros array with these dimensions
00:38 - and then I'm creating our named window
00:43 - with the name image so this might seem
00:47 - new to you because I haven't created a
00:50 - named window in the previous video so
00:52 - the named window you can use to create a
00:57 - window with a name and this time we have
01:01 - given the named window name as image now
01:04 - in this while loop we are just using
01:06 - this I am show method to call this
01:10 - window and then loading this image
01:13 - inside this named window
01:16 - now you might already know what this
01:19 - code does it just wait for the key and
01:22 - if the key is escape key then we will
01:27 - break out of this loop and in the last
01:30 - we are just destroying all the windows
01:32 - which we have created now in order to
01:35 - create a drag bar you just need to use
01:39 - CV and then call a method called create
01:43 - track bar now the first argument here
01:46 - you need to give is the track bar name
01:49 - because you can create multiple track
01:53 - bars in your image window that's why you
01:57 - need to provide a name which is unique
02:00 - to this track bar so I'm going to just
02:04 - give the name to my track bar as B
02:07 - because what I want to do is I want to
02:11 - change the BG our values of
02:14 - the image using the track bar so the
02:18 - first track bar will change the B
02:21 - channel values that's why this first
02:24 - argument is the track bar name which is
02:28 - B and the second argument here we will
02:31 - give is the name of the window so that
02:34 - one that is why we have created this
02:36 - named window so that we can provide the
02:40 - name of the window which is image in
02:43 - this case and that is how we know that
02:46 - in which window we need to add at the
02:49 - track bar so in the image window which
02:52 - is this one we want to add the B track
02:56 - bar now the third argument here will be
02:59 - the value which is the initial value at
03:02 - which your track bar is set and the next
03:06 - value here will be the count which is
03:09 - the final value you want to set for your
03:13 - track bar now there is this last thing
03:17 - which we want to set here and this is
03:20 - the callback function which will be
03:22 - called whenever your track bar values
03:26 - changes so here for example I'm going to
03:30 - create a callback function called
03:34 - nothing and this callback function
03:38 - definition or signature I'm going to
03:41 - create here so we can just create
03:45 - callback function with a name
03:47 - nothing and this function can take this
03:52 - value X and this is the value of the
03:55 - current position of your track bar so we
03:59 - will see what it does little bit later
04:02 - and what we are going to do is we are
04:04 - going to just print the value of X so we
04:07 - will know the current position if this
04:10 - track bar is changed so this is the
04:14 - callback function which will be called
04:16 - whenever your track bar value changes
04:19 - same we will do with the other track bar
04:23 - so we will create the three track bars
04:25 - in the same
04:27 - do with the name bee and the next track
04:31 - bar name will be the G and the last
04:35 - track bar name will be R okay so this
04:38 - will be capital R so now let's run this
04:43 - code and let's see what happens when we
04:44 - run this code so I'm going to right
04:46 - click and run this script and you can
04:49 - see here inside this named window with
04:53 - the name image we have this black image
04:57 - which we have created using numpy zeroes
05:00 - array and now we have three track bars
05:03 - here with BG our names so these track
05:07 - bar values you can change using this
05:11 - scroller and as you can see here let me
05:15 - show you in this terminal whenever you
05:18 - change the value of any bar the
05:23 - corresponding value will be shown here
05:26 - using this callback function and inside
05:30 - this callback function we have the print
05:31 - statement okay so as I said whenever you
05:34 - change this value this callback function
05:37 - is called and it will print the value of
05:40 - the current track bar okay so for this
05:45 - functionality what we want to do is we
05:47 - want to get the current position of the
05:51 - track bar and because we can change the
05:54 - value of BG are channels from 0 to 255
05:58 - that's why I have given the range
06:01 - between 0 to 255 to the track bars also
06:05 - so that you can change these BGR channel
06:09 - values so now in order to get the
06:12 - current value of your track bar first of
06:15 - all we will just check the value of the
06:19 - B track bar so we will just use CV dot
06:23 - get track bar position which is this
06:27 - method get track bar POS and then we
06:32 - just need to give the name of our track
06:34 - bar so let's say we want to check the
06:37 - position of track bar be
06:40 - then we will just say we want to have
06:42 - this track bar position with the name B
06:46 - and the second argument here will be the
06:50 - name of your window so in which window
06:54 - this track bar is present so the our
06:58 - track bar is present inside the image
07:01 - window right so same we will do for the
07:06 - G and R values also
07:13 - now we have the values of B G our
07:17 - channels from the track bar so now we
07:21 - want to set these values to our image so
07:24 - what we can do here is we can just write
07:29 - for example I am G inside these square
07:34 - brackets you can just give this kind of
07:37 - notation and then give that BG our
07:41 - channel values I'm going to just write B
07:43 - comma G comma R that means we want to
07:47 - set the current B G R values to this
07:52 - image so let's run this code and let's
07:54 - see what happens now so I'm going to run
07:56 - this code and now when I change the blue
08:01 - channel values you can see this image
08:03 - becomes blue colored right let's bring
08:09 - it to zero once again and now let's
08:11 - change the value of G so you can see
08:14 - this image color is changing to green
08:18 - and then we can try changing the red
08:22 - color and you can see when it goes to
08:25 - 255 the color of the image is red you
08:29 - can change the values of different track
08:34 - bars and the corresponding color will be
08:38 - displayed in this window here right so
08:42 - you can see the color is changing you
08:45 - can change any track bar here one more
08:48 - example I want to give here is how to
08:50 - add a switch using our track bar so for
08:54 - that I'm going to use one variable
08:57 - called switch and then here I can add
09:04 - first of all the name of the switch
09:11 - and in the next line we will once again
09:14 - called CB to dot create track bar with
09:19 - the name switch okay so now the name of
09:23 - our track bar will be switch
09:33 - so now we have added one more track bar
09:35 - to our named window and now here we will
09:40 - get the current position of this switch
09:44 - track bar so I'm going to name it as s
09:47 - and the name of the window is switched
09:50 - so we will just give the first argument
09:52 - of this get tribe our position as switch
09:56 - okay and the window name is image itself
10:00 - so now we can add some condition here so
10:04 - let's say if this position of the switch
10:08 - which we have if this position is equal
10:11 - to zero because we only have zero and
10:15 - one in this last track bar so if this
10:18 - position is equal to zero what we want
10:21 - to do is we want to set I am G and then
10:27 - in the square bracket this colon and we
10:31 - don't want to change any value so we
10:32 - will say that I am G this square bracket
10:37 - colon is equal to zero which means that
10:40 - we don't want to do anything or in the
10:44 - other condition which is when your track
10:47 - bar is at position one then only we want
10:52 - to change the BG our channel of the
10:56 - image okay so let's run this code and
10:59 - let's see what happens so I'm going to
11:01 - run this code and now you can see the
11:05 - position of this track bar switch is
11:08 - zero and when I change it to one so
11:12 - let's change this position to one you
11:15 - can see the value to one and when this
11:19 - position is at zero you can change
11:22 - anything here any track bar nothing
11:24 - happens because this condition is matte
11:28 - which means that we don't want to do
11:31 - anything as soon as we change the switch
11:34 - to one that means we want to change the
11:36 - BG our values you can see this color is
11:41 - changed inside the image so the zero is
11:45 - just like
11:47 - off switch so we don't want to change
11:49 - any color and one is like on switch so
11:53 - when it's one the value of RB G channels
11:58 - can be changed now I want to give one
12:01 - more example of track bar to use so
12:04 - that's why I have created one more file
12:06 - which is PI Python OpenCV track bar
12:09 - example 2 and this time I'm going to use
12:11 - just two track bars here so that's why
12:15 - I'm going to delete some of the code
12:18 - here so using the first track bar let's
12:20 - say I want to just change some values
12:23 - inside our image and I want to print
12:26 - that value on that image so let's say
12:29 - now our range is between 10 to 400 ok so
12:35 - the lower range is 10 and the upper
12:37 - range is 400 and using this track bar I
12:41 - want to print the current value on our
12:45 - image and also I want to have a switch
12:48 - which I can toggle and I want to change
12:52 - the color of the image from the colored
12:55 - value or colored image to the grayscale
12:58 - image
13:01 - so now our switch is between color to
13:05 - the grayscale image now in here what we
13:07 - want to do is we want to just assign
13:10 - this I am show value to the image
13:14 - variable itself and then we want to get
13:16 - the current position of the track bar so
13:19 - we will use this method to get the
13:22 - current position of the track bar and
13:25 - I'm going to name this current position
13:27 - as POS variable and the name of this
13:32 - track bar let's change this name to
13:34 - something else let's say CP for current
13:38 - position and also here CP for the
13:42 - current position and the name of the
13:45 - named window is image itself so we are
13:47 - not changing it so now we have the
13:50 - current position so first of all we will
13:53 - just create the font and then we will
13:58 - just use the CV dot put text method you
14:03 - already know what this method does it
14:06 - just print the text on your image and
14:09 - then we will provide the parameters
14:11 - first argument is the image the second
14:13 - argument is the value which we get from
14:17 - the track bar so this is the position
14:20 - and because it's a number we need to
14:22 - convert it to the string using STR
14:25 - method and then the position at which
14:28 - you want to show this text so let's say
14:32 - it's 50 comma 150 and then next is the
14:37 - font so I'm going to just give the font
14:39 - and then the next value is the font
14:42 - scale which is 4 and the next value is 4
14:47 - the color of the text so let's say the
14:50 - color here will be 0 comma 0 comma 255
14:54 - and this should be C V dot 2 font
14:57 - Hershey complex let's change this font
15:01 - also let's say this is just the simplex
15:04 - font okay so this code is going to just
15:08 - print the color current position of the
15:10 - track bar on your image and then inside
15:14 - this condition what we want to do is we
15:17 - want to get the switch value so let's
15:21 - use this as variable and then get the
15:24 - current position of the switch using
15:27 - this switch name from the image window
15:31 - and then if the switch is at zero
15:35 - position then we want to do nothing so
15:38 - we will just pass the situation and in
15:42 - case the value of this switch is 1 then
15:46 - what we want to do is we want to change
15:49 - the image value from color to the
15:53 - grayscale value right so you can just
15:55 - write C V dot C V T color and the first
16:02 - argument is the image which we are
16:05 - loading and the second argument is CV
16:07 - dot color BGR to gray which is to
16:11 - convert this colored image to grayscale
16:14 - image but you can see here we are just
16:17 - creating a black colored image and in
16:20 - our project we also have this image so
16:22 - let's read this image so I'm going to
16:25 - just write a CV dot I am read and then
16:29 - give the name of the image which is
16:31 - Lenna
16:32 - dot jpg so this is our colored image and
16:37 - this way we will be able to see the
16:41 - change of color to greyscale image in a
16:44 - better way so let's run this code and
16:46 - let's see what happens and you can see
16:49 - image appears and disappears and there
16:53 - is an error so let's see what is the
16:55 - error so the error here is coming from
16:57 - this line so we need to read this image
17:01 - inside the while loop ok so this is why
17:07 - our error is coming and at the last we
17:11 - want to load this image after this if
17:14 - condition okay so now let's run this
17:18 - code once again and you can see this
17:21 - value is printed on our image which is
17:26 - 10 which is
17:27 - the value of CP and if we change this
17:30 - value it is changing on our image also
17:34 - right and once we change this 0 to 1
17:38 - then our image is converted from colored
17:42 - image to the grayscale image you can
17:46 - also change the font size here for
17:50 - example let's say it's 6 here and the
17:55 - thickness also if you want to change you
17:57 - can change it using this parameter let's
18:00 - say it's 10 and let's run this code once
18:04 - again you can see the thickness and the
18:07 - size of the font is changed and you can
18:10 - see this value in a better way ok so
18:14 - this is how you can use track bars in
18:17 - OpenCV I hope you enjoyed this video and
18:20 - I will see you in the next video
18:29 - you
