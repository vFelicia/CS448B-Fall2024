00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you what are cookies and how to set
00:05 - cookies in
00:06 - PHP so let's see what is a cookie so a
00:11 - cookie is often used to identify a user
00:15 - okay a cookie is a small file that the
00:19 - server embeds on your computer so server
00:23 - can be your website or some website uh
00:26 - which you are browsing and this website
00:30 - embeds some small file inside your
00:34 - computer or in a particular browser and
00:38 - this file will remain in your computer
00:41 - and this uh each time whenever
00:46 - your computer request the same page it
00:50 - will send the cookie to right
00:54 - so for example uh there you you browse
01:00 - some website and it sets some cookie
01:02 - inside your computer inside a particular
01:05 - browser it will remain in that browser
01:09 - until and unless that cookie expire and
01:13 - that expiration time can be months weeks
01:18 - or year even right and how cookies are
01:23 - different from session is whenever you
01:27 - use session uh it will last for only for
01:30 - that session that means whenever you use
01:34 - the session and you whenever you close
01:36 - your browser your session will also be
01:40 - destroyed so session will not remain for
01:43 - a long time in your uh browser or in
01:47 - your computer it will go once you close
01:50 - your browser but a cookie can remain in
01:53 - your computer for a long time uh uh or a
01:59 - Time
02:00 - at which it's uh you know set to destroy
02:03 - it it can be one year it can be one
02:05 - month it can be one day so you can set
02:08 - the expiration time of the cookie
02:11 - whereas you cannot set the expiration
02:12 - time of your session it is destroyed
02:16 - whenever you close your session right
02:19 - now let's see how we can set cookies in
02:22 - PHP so I have this cookie. PHP uh file
02:26 - and let's see how we can set cookies so
02:29 - this is a small method called set cookie
02:34 - we use to
02:36 - set the cookie inside your browser and
02:40 - it takes
02:41 - five arguments first is the name of the
02:46 - cookie second is the value of the cookie
02:49 - third is the expiration time of the
02:51 - cookie and fourth is the path and fifth
02:54 - is the domain name and for this
02:57 - demonstration I will just use these
02:58 - three parameters so you can also use the
03:01 - set cookie function with these
03:03 - parameters also okay now for example I
03:07 - want to set some
03:11 - cookie for the student for example so I
03:15 - will give the cookie name
03:22 - as student okay and the value is for
03:26 - example name of the student which is
03:29 - Mark okay and third parameter it's uh
03:33 - interesting it's the expiration time
03:36 - okay and how you can set expiration time
03:41 - uh it takes the second or number of
03:44 - second from the
03:46 - reference of uh the time now right so in
03:53 - PHP there is a function called time so
03:55 - for example I declare a variable time
04:00 - is equal to and there is a function
04:02 - called time also and this time gives
04:07 - you the time stem so let's Echo the time
04:14 - Echo the
04:17 - time and what this time is I'll save
04:21 - it
04:23 - and I will go
04:26 - and browse here cookie
04:30 - and see this time here so it's giving us
04:35 - this uh 147 5 3 5 4 whatever so this is
04:42 - a time stamp and what is a time stamp a
04:47 - time stamp uh you can say is a it's
04:52 - called Epoch time if you know about a PO
04:55 - time uh its reference is 1970
05:00 - right and and it calculates the relative
05:05 - seconds from 1970 to till now and this
05:09 - is the value of seconds from that date
05:11 - so reference for the Epoch time is 1970
05:15 - I think and this value is the number of
05:18 - seconds from that date in 1970 whatever
05:23 - is the reference okay so in general we
05:27 - use it as a standard time stamp anywhere
05:31 - in PHP or any in any other uh languages
05:36 - right
05:37 - so in PHP you can uh just display this
05:41 - time stamp like this using time function
05:45 - so if you want to know about this uh
05:48 - this time stamp you just search for
05:51 - Epoch date and time just search
05:55 - for aox date and time and you will be
06:01 - able to you know see many links on web
06:06 - by using which you may know about this
06:09 - Epoch date and time right so you you can
06:12 - see Epoch converter and EPO reference
06:16 - date in Wikipedia you can uh see here
06:21 - what can be the reference date okay so I
06:24 - will leave it uh on you how to know
06:29 - about this Epoch Diamond time right so
06:32 - just remember that this time is the time
06:35 - from Epoch reference date which is 1970
06:39 - I think okay now to set the expiry date
06:44 - this is the time now right this will
06:47 - give you the time now okay time stem now
06:51 - and now you need to use this time and
06:55 - set the reference according to the time
06:58 - or relative to the this time and this
07:00 - third parameter takes the expiry uh you
07:04 - know expired time so this is the time
07:07 - now and you can set that you want to uh
07:10 - destroy the cookie
07:13 - after uh 5 seconds for example or 10
07:17 - seconds right so this cook keie will
07:21 - remain in your computer for 10 second
07:25 - from the from whenever you open this
07:28 - page right right okay now how to uh you
07:34 - know display or use
07:36 - cookies here is the setting of The
07:38 - Cookie right and how to use this you can
07:42 - use this by for
07:44 - example uh you can
07:50 - declare student is equal to then you can
07:55 - just use this
07:58 - underscore
07:59 - cookie okay
08:02 - and in here you can give the name of
08:06 - your cookie and the name of the cookie
08:08 - is student here
08:12 - right and then you can display this
08:16 - cookie so I can just say
08:23 - Echo
08:25 - student okay I save it
08:30 - and I will go to my
08:32 - browser and then first of all I will set
08:37 - the Cookie by using this cookie. PHP so
08:40 - this will set my cookie
08:43 - as like this so set cookie uh name is
08:47 - equal to student value is equal to Mark
08:49 - and this cookie will remain for 10
08:52 - second in my browser right so I can
08:55 - quickly go to view and now cookie is
08:58 - destroyed because 10 seconds seconds are
09:00 - over once again let's check it once
09:02 - again okay so I refresh this I set
09:06 - cookie go back and View and there is
09:11 - some mistake in here let's see what is
09:17 - it oh yeah here I have
09:22 - two single codes so I corrected it once
09:25 - again let's see so
09:28 - refresh set cookie cookie is set and now
09:32 - when I view I can see the name for 10
09:35 - second so I refresh the browser refresh
09:38 - the browser refresh the browser and
09:40 - after 10 seconds cookie is destroyed
09:43 - right once again set cooky and go to
09:46 - view.php I can see the name and I
09:49 - refresh the browser until 10 second and
09:53 - after 10 second I will see the result
09:56 - like this that says cookie is destroyed
10:00 - okay so in this way you can set cookie
10:04 - and set the expired time of this cookie
10:07 - uh so that uh whatever time you want to
10:10 - set you can set it like this so I hope
