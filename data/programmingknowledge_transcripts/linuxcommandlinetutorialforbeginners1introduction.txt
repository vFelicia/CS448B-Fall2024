00:00 - hey guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners now the first question you may
00:07 - ask yourself is why bother about
00:09 - learning the command line so the simple
00:14 - answer for this question is graphical
00:16 - user interface or GUI interface like
00:19 - this one is helpful in many tasks but
00:22 - they are not good for all tasks and
00:25 - gradually when you learn command line
00:28 - you will observe that you are able to do
00:32 - your day-to-day tasks or any tasks
00:35 - related to some programming much faster
00:39 - than you can do with your graphical user
00:41 - interface now the graphical user
00:44 - interface are user friendly you know at
00:49 - the first look but when you want to do
00:51 - more about a program for example knowing
00:55 - the details about what's happening in
00:58 - the background then you may want to use
01:01 - command line because by using command
01:04 - line you know all the background details
01:08 - of a program right now before diving
01:12 - into the world of linux command line you
01:15 - need to learn two terms one is the shell
01:18 - and second is the terminal now what is
01:22 - the shell simply put the shell is a
01:25 - program that takes command from the
01:28 - keyboard and gives them to the operating
01:31 - system to perform right now a
01:34 - command-line or shell you can also say
01:37 - it's a CLI CLI stand for a command-line
01:42 - interface now the second term is the
01:45 - terminal a terminal is a tool which you
01:48 - can use to pass your shell commands this
01:51 - is a program that opens a window and
01:54 - lets you interact with the shell now
01:57 - there are different operating system
01:59 - available for the Linux but I will be
02:02 - using Ubuntu operating system now if you
02:05 - don't know how you can install Ubuntu on
02:08 - a VirtualBox or VMware Player I have the
02:11 - video on that
02:13 - and you can you know wash them and
02:15 - install Ubuntu on your native Windows
02:18 - operating system also using VMware
02:21 - Player or VirtualBox which are a virtual
02:24 - machine on which you can host your Linux
02:27 - operating system so I will be using the
02:30 - Ubuntu operating system but you are free
02:32 - to use any other Linux operating system
02:35 - and terminal commands are all same or
02:39 - almost the same on all you know Linux
02:42 - based operating system now on Ubuntu how
02:45 - you can open our 10 terminal it's really
02:48 - easy so you just need to go to this
02:51 - button and then just click it and then
02:54 - search for terminal so just write
02:57 - terminal and the first icon you will
03:01 - find here is your terminals when you
03:04 - click it it will open the terminal right
03:07 - now there is one command to open our
03:10 - terminal also which is a keyboard
03:13 - shortcut when you press ctrl alt T it
03:17 - will also open our terminal ok so this
03:21 - is the shortcut for opening the terminal
03:24 - now once you are in the terminal then
03:28 - you can perform bunch of command but
03:30 - before this we need to understand what
03:33 - is a filesystem and how you know these
03:38 - filesystem work in Linux right so like
03:43 - all other operating system the files on
03:46 - Linux system are also arranged in what
03:50 - we called a hierarchical directory
03:53 - structure which means that they are
03:56 - organized in a tree-like pattern of
03:59 - directories in Windows you are no
04:02 - directories as folders also now
04:05 - directories may contain files or other
04:08 - directories also now the most you know
04:12 - root or basic directory in Linux is the
04:15 - root directory and under this directory
04:18 - all files and folders are residing now I
04:23 - will use this graphical interface to
04:26 - show you this filesystem of Linux so I
04:30 - will just go here which is files and I
04:33 - will open this and then I will go to
04:37 - this computer so just click this option
04:40 - which says computer and this is your
04:43 - root folder ok and root folder start
04:47 - from this forward slash you can see here
04:50 - ok and then all the directories reside
04:53 - in this root folder for example home Lib
04:57 - or a bin which contains all the binary
05:00 - you know binaries of your Linux
05:04 - operating system and other folders which
05:07 - we learn later right so every Linux
05:11 - operating system has this root folder
05:13 - and under which all the files are aside
05:16 - ok now let's start our Linux command
05:19 - line journey now the first command you
05:23 - may want to learn is the PWD command
05:27 - which is a present working directory
05:30 - command and this shows you in which
05:35 - directory you are currently in so let's
05:38 - give the PWD command so just give PWD
05:42 - and press Enter and it says home slash
05:47 - programming knowledge which is my user
05:49 - name for this computer ok so whenever
05:52 - you will open a terminal by default the
05:56 - per present working directory is your
05:59 - home directory which is home slash your
06:03 - user name in my case its programming
06:06 - knowledge right now if you want to go to
06:09 - the root folder what you need to do so
06:13 - if you want to go to the root folder
06:14 - there is a command called CD which is a
06:19 - change directory command we will learn
06:21 - this change directory command in details
06:24 - in the later video but I will just show
06:27 - you how it works so just give CD and
06:30 - then give forward slash here which is
06:33 - our root directory ok so just press
06:37 - enter and then we will be in the root
06:40 - directory so once again when you press a
06:43 - PWD command and press Enter
06:46 - then you can see we are now in the root
06:49 - directory the other command is LS which
06:53 - is list this command also we are going
06:56 - to learn in detail in the next videos
06:59 - but let's see how it was so LS is to
07:03 - list all the files and directories in
07:06 - the present working directory so just
07:09 - give LS and press ENTER and it will show
07:12 - you the same directories and files which
07:15 - you can see here so I will just make it
07:19 - a little bit smaller so that we can see
07:21 - so you can see bin dabbe boot et Cie all
07:25 - the files and folders you will be able
07:28 - to find here in this user interface as
07:32 - you can see here also which are listed
07:34 - by using this LS command ok so I think
07:40 - that's it for this video in the next
07:43 - video we will you know start our journey
07:45 - with Linux command line and we will
07:47 - learn the basic command and we will
07:49 - gradually move to the advanced stuff so
07:52 - I hope you enjoyed this video please
