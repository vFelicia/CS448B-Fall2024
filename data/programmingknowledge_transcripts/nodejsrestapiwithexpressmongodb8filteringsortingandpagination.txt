00:00 - hi in this video we're going to learn
00:02 - treating with our filter page nation and
00:05 - sorting now whenever we hit this end
00:09 - point we have we get on the task but we
00:13 - want just one task like you want the
00:15 - tasks that are completed or not
00:18 - completed so for going for getting this
00:21 - type of functionality we have to use the
00:24 - filter personality
00:25 - so in here which is creating modify here
00:28 - and let's say the part the part will be
00:32 - the task because in this part in this
00:37 - where we are going to modify the values
00:40 - and the match this will is where we have
00:44 - to like what you have to match it with
00:47 - so it's completed let's see it will be a
00:51 - true value and now if we save it and run
00:56 - it
00:56 - yeah you will get only the two values
00:59 - and if we just use the false we can get
01:05 - on little parts values now this is not
01:10 - dynamically so we have to write some
01:12 - code in here so in here let's create a
01:16 - Const match and we are just going to use
01:22 - a query because in here the filter will
01:26 - be requested query Todd is completed if
01:29 - this is the object is here and we are
01:34 - going to simply write match dot is
01:39 - completed is equal to request dot
01:44 - wearing top is completed basically we
01:49 - get true this is because this body will
01:52 - go string so whenever we used to use
01:58 - compare it with the true value we can
02:01 - get the value with that will play assign
02:05 - to the master is completed now if it's a
02:11 - it will be a sign here if it is a false
02:15 - value it will be a sign and it will
02:18 - compare with the truth and then I
02:20 - couldn't be handed a masterpiece one
02:22 - little no just we have to do both taste
02:25 - and we are going to stay with here and
02:29 - now if we run it again but first we have
02:33 - to like give it what we have to know
02:36 - later so that it's completely put it
02:40 - true now if we run it again you will see
02:44 - that we can get a true values and if we
02:48 - use false here we can get the false but
02:53 - now there is one thing it's called
02:57 - personal so so in pairs in essence there
03:01 - is two things it is a limit and escape
03:07 - in limit this is what we call like what
03:11 - the amount of data that we want but what
03:14 - amount of data that we are going to
03:16 - limit to an escape is the value that is
03:20 - what are the next next value next after
03:25 - the next Schiphol that the values that
03:28 - we want that means if it is a ten value
03:32 - it means that we need the set of
03:34 - another's ten values after the first
03:37 - thing values so for getting this we just
03:42 - have to use options field and it's an
03:48 - object in here we just have to give
03:51 - limit integer value and skip integer
03:57 - value so if we are going to use
04:00 - dynamically but it is a it it will be a
04:06 - parcel because the value that we get
04:08 - from postman it will be a string so just
04:12 - we have to convert it into a into a
04:15 - integer we are just going to use
04:17 - requested query dot limit and in here
04:24 - the part
04:24 - it we are just going to use parsing
04:30 - request dot query dog skip now if we
04:39 - save it and in here first we are going
04:44 - to see all tasks here all the tasks are
04:47 - here wants to - not we want to get only
04:51 - this distance we are just going to limit
04:55 - it to o1 you get only one task and if we
05:05 - skip table to one that means we are
05:09 - going to skip this task and go to the
05:12 - next second task then we get this second
05:18 - task and if we're going to use to you
05:21 - will get the third task so this is
05:25 - Harlem we can skip works now next to
05:29 - starting so in here sorting is done by
05:34 - the next another in options where there
05:38 - is something called short filled in here
05:41 - this is this requires an object so in
05:47 - what way we are going to start it so if
05:51 - we again like learn it here so in what
05:55 - you are going to start it let's say we
05:57 - are going to start it according to the
05:59 - created act
06:01 - so if we use created at here so we have
06:06 - to send it like created at is equal is
06:11 - minus because this is a it requires a
06:15 - integer value and it only takes minus 1
06:18 - and 1 minus 1 is for descending and 1 in
06:23 - sport ascending so if we say minus 1 and
06:29 - now here we're just going to say with
06:33 - you and now if we look into in the
06:37 - created at
06:38 - and if we run it here
06:41 - - one the task is upside down insta-tox
06:46 - that is in the bottom it goes up that
06:50 - means this task is at a descending way
06:52 - that means this dog has come at a last
06:56 - this task has been clearly at the last
06:59 - so it is in a descending order so it
07:03 - will come first
07:05 - now if we say with little one and save
07:10 - it and run it we can get the first start
07:14 - that is created cost will be in here now
07:18 - if we start it according to the list
07:20 - completely so it's completed
07:26 - yeah no now if we want to like convert
07:32 - into a theory that is that will be
07:37 - upgraded to will be dynamically so for
07:43 - doing this leg is completed for doing
07:47 - this we just have to like create a new
07:50 - cost match is equal to send an object
07:58 - back now now in here we are just going
08:04 - to use like sort by now created at
08:19 - created act distending we can write
08:25 - anyway like if we want to like use
08:28 - another symbol any symbol that you want
08:31 - I'm going to use : symbol here so if we
08:35 - want to use like this like creative at
08:38 - the sending way or ascending way if
08:43 - these type of things we want so we have
08:46 - to like use here if request dot query
08:54 - talk start by list there so we are just
09:01 - want to use to like short so what will
09:08 - be get you will get this value here
09:12 - created at this ascending or descending
09:16 - we have to split this string so for
09:20 - splitting it we are just going to lose
09:22 - cons a string is equal to request dot
09:27 - query towards short time and we are
09:32 - going to split using the split method
09:35 - and we are going to split according to a
09:41 - scholar for doing this video just have
09:44 - to use column here so we can really get
09:48 - to string here in an error no we are
09:53 - just going to start and we're going be
09:58 - qualities are going to a variable we are
10:00 - going to start STR is equal to so if STR
10:10 - 1 is equal to d SC we're going to use
10:19 - ternary operator here it is this then we
10:22 - are going to resign to minus 1 if it is
10:25 - not we are going to assign it one
10:29 - that's it you know if we just remove it
10:34 - and you start here and stay with you and
10:42 - if we turn it again you will get false
10:46 - future well nice anyway and if we is
10:50 - true here we will get you will get the
11:03 - value as a standing so yeah that's it so
11:08 - this is how the treating filtered
11:12 - business and and starting words in
11:15 - Mongols in no cheers thank you
