00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install OpenSSH server
00:04 - on your Rubin to operating system in
00:07 - order to enable SSH on your Ubuntu
00:11 - operating system but first of all what
00:13 - is SSH
00:15 - so SSH or secure shell is a protocol
00:18 - which is used to securely log into the
00:21 - remote operating system it is the most
00:24 - common way to access the remote Linux or
00:27 - UNIX like server for example ok so first
00:32 - of all we will just check where the SSH
00:35 - is installed on our system and then if
00:38 - it's not installed then we will see how
00:41 - to install it so first of all just give
00:43 - this command SSH to check whether SSH
00:46 - client is installed so SSH and then
00:49 - press Enter and if it gives this kind of
00:52 - response that means SSH client is
00:55 - installed on your system now you will be
00:58 - able to connect to our different remote
01:00 - operating system for example some server
01:03 - in some cloud by using this SSH command
01:08 - so you can just write SSH and then the
01:11 - username of that remote server and then
01:16 - at the rate I P address of that server
01:19 - and if it supports any special port then
01:23 - you can write minus P and the port
01:25 - number something like this write some
01:28 - port number ok so this is to verify
01:32 - whether ssh client is installed now
01:36 - let's see how to verify if ssh server is
01:38 - installed on your system which is
01:40 - OpenSSH server so once again give SSH
01:43 - and then localhost ok that means you are
01:48 - trying to connect to your localhost why
01:50 - is SH and then press Enter and if it
01:54 - gives this kind of response which says
01:56 - connection to host localhost port 22
01:58 - connection refused
02:00 - that means the OpenSSH server is not
02:03 - installed on your system so you need to
02:06 - install it in order to allow the other
02:08 - operating system for example if you are
02:10 - working on your Windows operating system
02:13 - you want to access this operating system
02:16 - which is your Ubuntu operating system by
02:18 - our terminal using SSH then you need to
02:21 - install this OpenSSH right so in order
02:23 - to install it just write sudo apt - get
02:28 - install open SSH - server ok and then
02:35 - press Enter
02:36 - and then give your open to spaz word and
02:39 - then it's going to start installing this
02:42 - open SS so just press Y to allow it to
02:46 - install now once this installation is
02:49 - complete I'm going to clear my terminal
02:52 - and to check whether OpenSSH server is
02:55 - running we can just give this command
02:58 - sudo and then service ssh status and
03:04 - then press enter and if it gives this
03:07 - kind of response which says active
03:09 - running that means OpenSSH server is
03:12 - running on your system so press Q to
03:15 - quit and then once again we are going to
03:18 - give this command SSH local host and
03:24 - then press Enter and you can see this
03:26 - time it allows us to connect to our own
03:30 - operating system wire terminal so this
03:34 - time just say yes and then give your
03:38 - open two password once again and you are
03:41 - logged into your own operating system
03:43 - which is your open to operating system
03:45 - now let's say if you want to change the
03:47 - default port on which as such works then
03:51 - you need to just change this port into a
03:55 - special file which is I'm going to show
03:57 - you where it is so let me clear the
03:59 - terminal once again and then just write
04:02 - this command which is sudo G added which
04:08 - is a editor we are going to use and then
04:10 - /e TC SSH and then SSH D underscore
04:18 - config and then press enter which is
04:21 - going to open this kind of file so this
04:24 - is the configuration file of this
04:26 - as I said server so if you want to
04:29 - change the pour just search for the port
04:32 - which is here you can see the default
04:35 - port is port 22 you can change it if you
04:37 - want to change it and if you want to run
04:40 - this OpenSSH so on some different port
04:44 - so the default port is 22 so now in this
04:47 - way you can log into this open to
04:50 - operating system from a different Linux
04:53 - or UNIX or even Windows operating system
04:56 - using SSH client or SSH command so I
05:01 - hope you've enjoyed this video please
