00:00 - hey everyone in this video we will try
00:03 - to make a registration form using
00:05 - thinker
00:06 - there is nothing to be explained about
00:08 - it as done in some of the last inter
00:10 - applications it is just assembling all
00:12 - that we have learned in Dinka this is
00:15 - more like a practice session so let's
00:17 - get started with the code right away
00:21 - from tenter import Star
00:23 - and also importing to
00:27 - Dot message box
00:31 - now I'll add my window root equals TK
00:37 - also I'll set a specific size of the
00:40 - window
00:41 - Let It Be 500 into 500.
00:44 - I will put that in inverted commas
00:47 - the form looks cleaner this way moreover
00:50 - it's been long we have used place to
00:52 - position objects mentioning the window
00:54 - size lets me manage coordinates easily
00:57 - then I'll also given a title I'll write
01:00 - shoot
01:01 - dot title
01:04 - registration form
01:07 - since we are making a registration form
01:09 - it would be registration form cool
01:14 - also let me give my form a little
01:16 - background so I'll write root dot config
01:20 - background equals
01:26 - hash f f
01:29 - e
01:30 - 6 f
01:33 - 0.
01:34 - now this should be an inverted commas
01:38 - also this is a light shade of pink
01:41 - you can also pick any random colors from
01:44 - Color Picker now
01:47 - I will make a very simple registration
01:49 - form it will have five entry Fields two
01:52 - for the complete name first and last
01:54 - name then a date of birth field a
01:57 - country field from which country the
01:59 - user belongs
02:00 - which will be a drop list along with
02:03 - selection checkbox
02:04 - and a radio button for gender selection
02:08 - okay
02:10 - so I'll just quickly declare all my five
02:13 - variables
02:15 - are string variables and if you cannot
02:18 - recall what string variables were they
02:21 - were usually used with the widgets entry
02:24 - and label since there are going to be
02:26 - many entries I would make use of string
02:29 - bar
02:30 - to manage them effectively I will not
02:33 - give in any arguments as they are
02:35 - directly contained in the master window
02:38 - so first name FN equals stringvar
02:42 - brackets
02:45 - last name Ln equals string bar again
02:51 - top the date of birth equals string bar
02:56 - variable equals string bar VAR
03:01 - or C1 equals Java this would be our
03:06 - checkbox one for the language selection
03:09 - word to
03:13 - equals python
03:15 - VAR C3 equals C plus plus
03:20 - and then radio variable again a string
03:24 - bar
03:27 - this war variable would be used for
03:30 - country
03:32 - and okay
03:34 - I would also like this information
03:38 - to be
03:39 - displayed later on the console after I
03:43 - have submitted the registration form
03:45 - so I'll have a function for that
03:48 - I'll write Def
03:50 - print
03:52 - entry
03:54 - rockets and column
03:59 - first equals FN
04:02 - dot get so first would be my first name
04:06 - variable
04:07 - you can take any variables that's not a
04:10 - problem
04:12 - and then for the last name I'll write
04:14 - second equals Ln dot get
04:20 - dob1 equals Tob dot get
04:25 - variable 1 equals variable dot get
04:31 - War 3 equals vrc1
04:35 - or 3 equals for C2
04:39 - War 3 equals or C3
04:45 - now these three were repeated because
04:48 - you would be selecting something from
04:51 - the check box only one option
04:54 - and accordingly the option would be fair
04:57 - in later on okay now I'll have my
05:00 - variable 4 equals radio underscore War
05:04 - dot get
05:07 - cool now I'll just print it
05:10 - so how I'll print it just follow along
05:12 - you know this already right print
05:16 - f
05:19 - the full name is
05:22 - first in curly braces and second in
05:25 - curly braces with a space in between
05:29 - then print f
05:33 - your age is
05:37 - top one
05:39 - and curly braces again and print
05:43 - if your country is
05:47 - in curly braces variable one
05:50 - then again print
05:53 - f
05:54 - your selected programming
05:57 - language is
06:04 - variable 3
06:06 - in curly braces again and print
06:10 - if your gender is in curly braces
06:14 - variable 4.
06:15 - now I'd be calling this function when
06:17 - I'd be done with my form filling so I'll
06:20 - also have this tincter Dot message box
06:23 - dot show info
06:25 - just to give the user a pop-up that your
06:28 - form has been filled
06:30 - so as the message I'll write
06:32 - congratulations
06:36 - this would be the heading of the pop-up
06:38 - box the message box
06:41 - and the message displayed in the Box
06:44 - would be user
06:47 - has
06:49 - successfully
06:52 - signed up
06:55 - now I'll start with the labels the text
06:58 - things and the entry fields so let's
07:02 - start with the heading I'll have a
07:04 - heading registration form
07:06 - so I'll have a variable heading equals
07:09 - label
07:13 - where do I want it I want it on root
07:16 - the window I have and text would be
07:21 - registration form
07:25 - let me decorate it a little so I'll
07:27 - write relief equals solid
07:31 - width equals twenty
07:36 - font
07:38 - area
07:40 - 19.
07:42 - and bold
07:44 - foreground is
07:47 - hash
07:48 - p30047
07:54 - and background is Hash FF
07:58 - e6f0
08:03 - now I'll place the heading heading dot
08:06 - place
08:07 - x equals 90 y equals 10.
08:13 - fine then for the first name I'll have a
08:16 - variable F name equals label
08:20 - it's just the text not the entry field
08:22 - right now so label and root
08:26 - text equals first name and column
08:30 - width equals 20 font equals bold 10
08:36 - background equals FF
08:39 - E6 F0
08:45 - fine now I'll place it
08:48 - fname dot place
08:53 - x equals 80.
08:58 - y equals 17.
09:01 - fine
09:03 - then for the entry field of the first
09:05 - name I'll write EF name
09:08 - equals entry
09:12 - root
09:14 - text War equals FN
09:18 - okay
09:20 - now FN was the string variable that we
09:22 - declared above I hope you remember this
09:25 - is how we have used it
09:27 - and I'll place it I need to place the
09:30 - entry field also so it should be on the
09:32 - same y-axis
09:34 - and so I'll write EF name dot place
09:39 - x equals 240 y equals 70. now very
09:45 - similarly for the last name L name
09:49 - equals label
09:51 - root
09:53 - text equals last name Colin
09:59 - width equals 20
10:02 - font equals bold then
10:05 - background equals again
10:08 - hash f f e 6 F 0
10:14 - so I'll place it
10:16 - lname dot Place x equals 80 y equals
10:22 - 120.
10:25 - now the entry field for the last name
10:28 - I'll just copy it from above and change
10:32 - the text bar
10:34 - equals Ln
10:36 - then I'll pack it again I'll just copy
10:40 - it
10:41 - the last entry field
10:43 - x axis would be same y coordinate would
10:47 - be 120 now
10:49 - fine then moving on to the date of birth
10:53 - label and entry I'll have date equals
10:57 - label
10:59 - root comma text equals top
11:04 - width equals 20
11:06 - font equals bold and then background
11:10 - again would be ffe6 F0
11:14 - and I'll place this I'll write date dot
11:18 - place
11:19 - x equals 80.
11:22 - y equals 170.
11:26 - fine then the entry field
11:29 - edob equals entry
11:33 - root
11:36 - and text bar equals top
11:41 - now I'll place it e t o p dot Place x
11:45 - equals 240 y equals 170. fine
11:51 - now I'll have the country and that would
11:54 - be your drop down list so first the
11:57 - label country equals label
12:03 - where do I want this I want it on the
12:05 - windows so I'll write root
12:08 - so the text would be country of course
12:11 - text equals country
12:15 - width equals 20 font equals poles 10
12:20 - for round equals ffe6 F0
12:24 - you can just copy it from above
12:27 - and change the text part
12:29 - and
12:32 - country dot place
12:35 - x equals 75 y equals to 20.
12:44 - now I'll given a list for the drop down
12:47 - box
12:48 - and let's have it let's have the list
12:51 - now
12:52 - list equals
12:56 - let me give in some names of country
12:59 - Nepal
13:01 - India
13:04 - America
13:06 - China
13:09 - doll
13:11 - Japan
13:13 - South Africa
13:18 - and you can given names of any countries
13:21 - and a lot more countries
13:25 - and I'll just make it a drop down list
13:28 - now how do we do it so drop list equals
13:31 - option menu
13:34 - it's again a printer function
13:37 - and root
13:40 - and variable
13:43 - variable would save the value of the
13:46 - list whatever was selected
13:49 - and where the values will be selected
13:52 - from the list so star list
13:57 - fine now to set the value I'll write VAR
14:01 - dot set select country
14:05 - okay
14:07 - now drop list dot config
14:11 - since the drop list values that is war
14:14 - can change so I need to configure the
14:16 - drop list
14:18 - and I'll just give in the width equals
14:21 - 15.
14:26 - so I'll just place it drop list dot
14:30 - place
14:31 - x equals 238 y equals to 20.
14:37 - now again I'll have a label for the
14:39 - language
14:42 - equals label
14:45 - root
14:47 - text equals programming language
14:52 - width equals 20 font bold and 10.
14:56 - background same as above ffe6f0
15:01 - and I'll place this variable language
15:04 - language dot place
15:09 - x equals 95
15:11 - and Y equals to 70.
15:15 - fine
15:17 - now I'll have the check buttons
15:20 - C1 equals check button
15:23 - root
15:26 - text equals Java
15:29 - variable equals War C1
15:33 - dot place
15:35 - now here I'll be placing this all
15:39 - together
15:40 - without taking it separately
15:43 - and x equals 235
15:46 - y equals to 70.
15:50 - just copy this entire statement twice
15:53 - because we have two more check buttons
15:56 - text would be python for the second one
15:59 - C2 and where variable would be VAR C2
16:04 - and I'll place it somewhere else that is
16:07 - x equals to nine t
16:09 - and Y equals to 70.
16:12 - similarly
16:15 - for C plus plus
16:20 - VAR C3
16:22 - and I'll change the x coordinates also
16:27 - fine now for the gender I'll have the
16:30 - label
16:31 - I'll just copy it from above
16:34 - because everything is same just need to
16:37 - change the text that is gender
16:41 - otherwise width font and background
16:45 - color they all are same
16:47 - and I'll place it somewhere else I'll
16:50 - write gender dot place
16:52 - x equals 73
16:55 - y equals 320. fine
17:00 - now for gender I'll have radio buttons
17:03 - I can have male and female
17:06 - so R1 equals radio button
17:10 - root
17:12 - text equals mail
17:16 - variable equals radio underscore War
17:20 - value equals mail dot place
17:25 - x equals 230 comma y equals 320.
17:31 - copy the same R1 make it R2 and text
17:36 - would be female
17:38 - also the value would change to female
17:43 - and x coordinate would change to 290.
17:48 - fine
17:49 - so I had all my five entries
17:53 - and I'll have two buttons now one to
17:55 - quit
17:57 - and another for submitting the form so
18:00 - I'll have
18:01 - submit equals button
18:06 - root
18:07 - text equals submit
18:10 - width equals 12.
18:13 - background equals FF 4D 9 4
18:21 - ground let be white
18:23 - command equals print entry
18:27 - and I'll place it
18:29 - x equals 130
18:32 - y equals 400.
18:35 - I'll have
18:36 - the quit button so quit equals button
18:42 - root
18:43 - comma text equals quit
18:47 - width equals 12.
18:53 - background and foreground same as buff
18:56 - and command would be exit
19:00 - and I'll place it
19:02 - x equals to 80 comma y equals 400.
19:08 - and I'll call in the main Loop to root
19:11 - root dot main Loop it's good to go now
19:15 - we should not have any problem in the
19:18 - code let's run this uncheck it
19:25 - so I have the window the registration
19:27 - form
19:28 - I'll just quickly fill in some details
19:32 - you can see the labels and the entry
19:34 - fields for the first name I can fill in
19:38 - person one
19:42 - for last name I can fill in
19:45 - last name
19:50 - date of birth can be 12.
19:53 - 04 slash two zero zero one
19:58 - I can select some country see there's a
20:01 - drop list
20:02 - and let me select Canada
20:05 - programming language Let It Be python
20:09 - gender I'll click on mail
20:12 - and I'll submit
20:15 - so I have this
20:17 - pop-up box message box congratulations
20:20 - user has successfully signed up when I
20:23 - click on submit I have this printed on
20:26 - the console
20:28 - so this was it about the program
20:31 - hey everyone in the last video we made a
20:34 - form a registration form that was very
20:36 - basic and the information attained from
20:38 - it was just printed on the console now
20:41 - in this video we will get that into a
20:43 - data in a table in a database we will
20:46 - save the information and table so for
20:49 - that we have the SQL Lite model to carry
20:52 - out data related function
20:55 - now the entire program would be same
20:57 - except the print entry function let me
21:00 - copy the program I'll go to registration
21:02 - firm.pui
21:04 - control a control C and I'll just paste
21:08 - it over here Ctrl V
21:11 - INE
21:12 - now I'll import
21:15 - sqlite3 and if you don't have the module
21:18 - you can always download it using the
21:20 - command pip install SQL lite3
21:24 - so I'll write import
21:27 - SQL
21:29 - 8 3.
21:31 - fine
21:33 - and I'll just delete this function Dev
21:37 - print entry and in place I'll write def
21:39 - database
21:41 - I will get the variables so I'll write
21:43 - first just like print entry
21:46 - I'll write first equals FN dot get
21:55 - second
21:57 - equals
21:59 - Ln
22:00 - dot get last name the first name is done
22:03 - then dob1
22:06 - equals dob the date of birth dot get
22:09 - then variable one var1 equals War dot
22:14 - get
22:15 - this was for the country
22:17 - then
22:19 - variable 3
22:21 - bar 3 equals War underscore C1
22:27 - or 3 equals
22:30 - VAR underscore C2
22:34 - bar 3 equals War underscore C3
22:40 - fine then the radio button
22:43 - War 4 for the gender equals radio
22:48 - underscore or
22:50 - dot get
22:52 - now till here the program was same as
22:56 - the print entry function
22:58 - it changes when I start connecting this
23:01 - data
23:03 - with the table or the database now how
23:06 - do we do that I'll write I'll have a
23:08 - variable
23:09 - c-o-n-n that is for connection equals
23:13 - SQL light 3 dot connect
23:18 - and in Brackets I'll given the name of
23:21 - the database okay so I'll write form dot
23:23 - DB
23:25 - this is to establish a connection to
23:28 - sqlite you need to pass the database
23:30 - name you want to connect okay that was
23:33 - form dot DB
23:35 - if the specified database is not present
23:37 - on the disk then a new one would be
23:40 - created by sqlite otherwise it will
23:42 - connect to the one that is already
23:45 - present
23:46 - now if there is a connection established
23:49 - that was done by dot connect I'll write
23:52 - with con Conn
23:56 - cursor equals con dot cursor now this is
24:00 - another function by sqlite to create a
24:04 - cursor object to execute SQL light
24:06 - commands queries from python okay
24:08 - Now to create a database to add values
24:11 - to it SQL commands need to be executed
24:14 - and since we are doing that in a python
24:16 - file I need the cursor object okay now
24:19 - I'll write cursor.execute
24:24 - and in inverted commas I'll given the
24:27 - SQL command Okay so execute is used to
24:31 - run the SQL query and return the results
24:33 - okay
24:37 - so
24:39 - create table
24:42 - if not exists
24:46 - student
24:48 - which is the name of the database or the
24:50 - table
24:51 - SQL commands are not case sensitive
24:54 - but they are preferred to be written in
24:56 - uppercase
24:58 - then brackets
25:00 - are given the field names F name
25:04 - and what type of Entry would be made it
25:07 - would be text
25:09 - and then L name
25:13 - and also text
25:16 - DOB
25:17 - it is a date so I'll write date
25:20 - and Country
25:24 - text again
25:25 - programming language I'll write proc
25:28 - language
25:30 - it is also text
25:33 - and gender
25:35 - which is also text
25:37 - enclosed brackets and the inverted
25:39 - commas
25:41 - again I'll have another statement SQL
25:44 - statement I'll write cursor.execute
25:49 - in inverted commas
25:55 - insert into
25:59 - student
26:05 - F name
26:07 - L name
26:09 - dop country
26:11 - Pro language
26:15 - gender
26:17 - and what values would be inserted
26:20 - values
26:22 - Rockets I'll give in six question marks
26:26 - for six fields
26:31 - inverted commas close
26:36 - and
26:37 - comma the value of these question marks
26:41 - can be first
26:43 - these variables
26:45 - where we get the value of the string
26:48 - words first second
26:50 - dob1 War 1 War 3
26:55 - and War 4.
26:57 - fine
26:58 - these were just the two SQL statements
27:01 - that I needed and then I'll commit I'll
27:04 - write c o n n dot commit
27:09 - and buckets to make changes to the table
27:12 - to confirm the change is committed okay
27:14 - and also I need a pop-up box after I
27:17 - have submitted the form so I'll write
27:19 - tincter
27:21 - Dot message
27:22 - box
27:25 - dot show info
27:28 - uh we can print in the same message
27:30 - congratulations
27:35 - and for the information the user has
27:39 - successfully
27:42 - signed
27:46 - close and what it comes closed
27:49 - and the rest would be pretty similar
27:53 - we have all the entries we have the
27:55 - labels we have the entries
27:57 - we have the drop list for the country
27:59 - then we have the check buttons
28:02 - the radio buttons
28:04 - but here for the command of the submit
28:07 - button I'll change this to database
28:10 - instead of print entry
28:14 - and the rest can remain the same
28:17 - now let's run this let's fill in the
28:20 - form
28:21 - and then we'll check the database
28:24 - so I have my form now I'll fill in this
28:27 - registration form twice just to have
28:30 - some data when I'm checking the database
28:32 - the table
28:33 - so for first name I can write
