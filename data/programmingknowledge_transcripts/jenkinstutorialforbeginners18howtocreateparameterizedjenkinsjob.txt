00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Jenkins to troll for beginners in this
00:05 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:06 - parameterize your build in Jenkins now
00:10 - sometimes it is necessary or useful to
00:13 - have bills to take one or more
00:16 - parameters and Jenkins allow you to
00:20 - parameterize your build so that you can
00:23 - provide one or several parameters at the
00:26 - time of building your job so let's see
00:29 - how we can do it so we are going to
00:32 - create a new Jenkins job so I'm going to
00:35 - just click on new item and then I'm
00:38 - going to give the name to my job which
00:40 - is parameterised project and then we are
00:44 - going to choose the Freestyle project
00:46 - and I'm going to click OK here which is
00:48 - going to create our Jenkins job so once
00:52 - your job is created I will leave this
00:55 - description as default which is blank
00:58 - and then to parameterize your build you
01:01 - will see in this general section under
01:04 - the description there is an option
01:06 - called this project is parameterised ok
01:10 - so you just need to choose this option
01:12 - which says this project is parameterised
01:15 - here you can add several type of
01:19 - parameters for example boolean parameter
01:21 - or choice parameter or credentials
01:23 - parameter and you can see there are
01:25 - several parameters which you can choose
01:28 - from this list so we are going to choose
01:31 - let's say string parameter for now and
01:33 - here let's say at the time of building
01:37 - our job we want the user to provide the
01:39 - platform on which this Jenkins job is
01:42 - running so in the first option which
01:44 - asked us to provide the variables name
01:46 - we will just provide the platform
01:48 - keyword here which is the variable name
01:51 - which we will use in our build and you
01:55 - can also provide the default value of
01:57 - this parameter let's say the default
02:00 - value of this parameter is Linux it's
02:03 - optional so if you don't provide any
02:05 - default value it's ok but if you want
02:09 - you can provide the default value from
02:11 - here and also the description
02:13 - is also optional so if you want to
02:15 - provide the description you can provide
02:17 - it from here or you can leave it as
02:19 - default and there is one more option
02:22 - here which says trim the string if you
02:25 - check this option you can see what it
02:29 - does so a strip white spaces from
02:31 - beginning and the end from the string so
02:34 - we have added one parameter to our
02:38 - Jenkins build and then I will leave the
02:42 - other sections as default and in the
02:45 - build section I'm going to just choose
02:47 - this option which says execute shell if
02:50 - you are using Windows you can choose
02:52 - execute windows batch command from here
02:54 - and here I'm going to just echo the
02:57 - parameter which is provided by Jenkins
03:00 - to us so to echo a parameter on Linux
03:04 - you can use dollar symbol and then the
03:07 - parameter name which is in our case the
03:11 - parameter name is platform okay
03:13 - so just copy this parameter name and
03:17 - after this dollar symbol just write your
03:21 - parameter name and this is going to just
03:25 - print the value which you will provide
03:29 - for your parameter so I'm going to save
03:32 - this job and once the job is saved I'm
03:36 - going to just execute this bill so now
03:40 - one new thing you will see here is
03:42 - normally you will see this text as
03:45 - billed but because we have provided some
03:49 - parameters for this bill so it says here
03:52 - build with parameters okay
03:54 - so just click on this job and on the
03:57 - right hand side you will see here this
04:00 - build requires parameters and the
04:03 - default value of this variable or
04:05 - parameter platform we have given Linux
04:07 - here so let's change this default value
04:10 - let's say we want to just give UNIX
04:13 - value for our platform variable and I'm
04:17 - going to just click on this a bill
04:19 - button which is going to build our job
04:22 - with that parameter and I'm going to
04:24 - just go to the console output to see
04:27 - if it's successful or not so you can see
04:31 - this echo command is executed with the
04:34 - parameter which we have provided which
04:37 - is Unix
04:38 - okay so this is how you can provide the
04:41 - parameters to your Jenkins build now I'm
04:45 - going to go to the configuration once
04:47 - again so if you have a different
04:51 - operating system some operating system
04:54 - for example if you are using the same
04:57 - echo command on your Windows operating
05:01 - system you can use these modulus symbol
05:07 - in front and the back of your parameters
05:11 - so on Windows you need to provide this
05:13 - mod in front and at the end of your
05:16 - parameter then it will be executed
05:18 - without giving you problems so this is
05:21 - for Windows so I'm going to just provide
05:24 - this hash which is a comment and I'm
05:26 - going to just write Windows here so for
05:30 - Windows you need to use this mod symbol
05:33 - in front and end and on Mac I think this
05:36 - dollar will work if this dollar doesn't
05:40 - work then we can also use for example
05:44 - echo and then dollar and in these curly
05:49 - brackets you're a parameter name which
05:51 - is plate form so in some operating
05:54 - system this type of syntax is valid so
05:56 - you can also use this type of syntax now
05:59 - let's choose some more parameters from
06:03 - here so one parameter we have already
06:05 - provided which is a string parameter
06:07 - let's provide the second parameter and
06:10 - this parameter will be a choice
06:13 - parameter so you can choose from a list
06:16 - of the choices which you give here so
06:20 - the variable name I'm going to give here
06:22 - is choice itself and here you can give
06:27 - your choices so for example a b c d e
06:33 - something like this if you want to
06:35 - choose some other kind of variable name
06:37 - you can just choose
06:39 - and and then Windows or Mac or UNIX or
06:46 - any other so this type of choices you
06:49 - can provide in this choices box one by
06:52 - one on every line so every line is a
06:56 - choice here and I'm going to leave this
06:59 - description as default and let's echo
07:02 - this choice parameter also so I'm going
07:04 - to just right choice from here and then
07:07 - I'm going to just save this build and
07:10 - once again I'm going to click on build
07:12 - with parameters and you can see there
07:14 - are two parameters present now one is
07:17 - the platform parameter other is the
07:19 - choice parameter so platform I will
07:22 - leave as Linux and the choice I will
07:25 - just choose D here and then I'm going to
07:28 - click on build which is going to build
07:31 - my job and then I'm going to go to the
07:34 - console output and you can see it has
07:36 - echoed Linux first of all and then echo
07:40 - D is executed which we have chosen from
07:43 - the choice parameters so this is how you
07:46 - can parameterize your job or build in
07:49 - Jenkins I hope you enjoyed this video

07:54 - for now
