00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - programming knowledge so this is the
00:04 - third part of the five part video
00:06 - tutorial series on how to create a very
00:08 - simple application that enables the
00:11 - creation read update and delete of
00:13 - certain records from our database so
00:15 - again for this particular project we're
00:18 - focusing on the users and from the
00:21 - second video we have already implemented
00:24 - the form formed at the HP and we have
00:27 - already added this particular form with
00:30 - the ID as none editable the name the
00:33 - email and of course the Save button so
00:36 - in this particular tutorial guys in this
00:38 - particular video we're going to continue
00:40 - working on with the form dot PHP file
00:42 - and include or integrate the user class
00:48 - that we have created from the previous
00:49 - videos so let's go back to our code
00:52 - editor and start working with our form
00:55 - that page B file so in this video we're
00:57 - going to add the logic for handling if
01:00 - the user wants to add records or want to
01:02 - add users to our database and also we're
01:05 - going to add the logic handling the edit
01:08 - editing of certain records from our
01:10 - database so I think we're going to start
01:12 - with the post variable so in this
01:16 - particular logic we're going to handle
01:19 - the save or saving of users to our
01:22 - database so we have here the button name
01:25 - as BT and save so we're just going to
01:28 - check if that particular name of the
01:32 - variable is set in our post variable so
01:36 - if we set the pulse and of course the
01:44 - name of our button okay and open and
01:52 - close parentheses so it just means that
01:54 - if the user submitted the form with our
01:57 - button BTN save then process this logic
02:00 - inside for adding the user to our
02:03 - database but first let's just change
02:07 - this type or bottom type in to submit
02:09 - instead of button
02:11 - okay to ensure that the form will be
02:13 - submitted if the user clicks on this
02:16 - particular button so let's go back to
02:19 - this logic and try to set up the
02:23 - handling of inserting records to our
02:27 - database so first let's just get the
02:30 - value of our name so we're going to use
02:33 - the strip tags for that and of course
02:37 - the name of our input variable or I mean
02:42 - input element so this is for the name
02:46 - and of course we need one for our email
02:50 - so let's just copy and paste the same
02:53 - line and just change this into email
02:58 - okay and try to align this and of course
03:03 - as always we need to try or we need to
03:06 - add try and catch logic also or lines
03:12 - just to make sure that our software or
03:18 - project will exit normally okay
03:24 - and if ID is not equal to null then we
03:36 - need to make sure that we're going to
03:40 - update the users but first I think we
03:45 - need to set up or we need a new object
03:49 - of our user class that we have defined
03:52 - in our previous tutorials so before
03:54 - we're going to use the user class we're
03:57 - going to require it first so require
04:00 - once and then of course the classes and
04:03 - user data HP so that file contains our
04:08 - user class and let's create the object
04:12 - of our user so object user equals new
04:17 - user okay and then we can just use this
04:21 - particular object here in our logic down
04:24 - below so next again if the ID is not
04:30 - equal to null then we need to make sure
04:34 - to update the user okay
04:37 - object user and then update and this of
04:43 - course this particular method our
04:45 - function we have already defined it in
04:48 - our user dot PHP so update and it takes
04:52 - three parameters the name email and IV
04:56 - which we are going to supply it here
04:58 - named email and of course the ID for
05:02 - that particular insert and after that
05:06 - we're going to read the req object user
05:12 - redirect to index dot PHP index dot PHP
05:20 - and that's just set the query variable
05:24 - update or updated so as you can see also
05:29 - the rid Iraq function we already define
05:33 - it here in our user that page with class
05:36 - so function redirect and if the ID is
05:42 - not equal to null or if the idea is now
05:46 - then we need to insert a new user
05:50 - so object if object object jack user
06:06 - insert and of course the insert function
06:10 - takes in two parameters which is the
06:12 - email and the name and after that we're
06:16 - just going to redirect the page into the
06:21 - index dot PHP and update this query
06:24 - variable into inserted okay and
06:27 - otherwise
06:31 - we need to read the wreck to index that
06:34 - PHP and say that there was an error
06:40 - during the processing of inserting the
06:43 - user to the database and of course we
06:48 - need also to display its if something
06:52 - happens so our logic above so get
06:54 - message okay and that's it for our
07:02 - adding the user to our database so again
07:06 - we also need to work on with the editing
07:10 - of user ok so here we need to check if
07:18 - the user for ID edit ID of the user if
07:31 - the Edit ID query variable is set we
07:35 - need to do something and set the values
07:38 - here in our form so as you can see now
07:40 - that the values here in our form for
07:44 - example the name so it's kind of empty
07:48 - for now so let's make sure to add values
07:52 - to this if the Edit ID is set so first
07:57 - thing that we're going to need is to get
07:59 - the ID so get and the Edit ID and we're
08:09 - going to define a statement here
08:11 - statement and of course using or object
08:14 - user we're going to run a query again
08:18 - this particular function we have already
08:20 - defined it in our user that page but
08:22 - user that PHP file under the user class
08:26 - so this particular function takes in a
08:30 - warrant a SQL statement so select all
08:35 - from
08:38 - the label name which is the cruisers
08:41 - where IT equals the ID that we're going
08:48 - to supply then after this line we need
08:51 - to execute the statement by using the
08:56 - execute function and array array for our
09:09 - ID okay and we need to get the user raw
09:21 - user equals s TM T and then fetch and
09:28 - video fetch associative array okay there
09:38 - you go and then we need to end a
09:39 - statement here else we're just going to
09:45 - set the ID into known and of course the
09:51 - role user to null as well and right now
09:56 - we can set the values from or we can set
09:58 - the values to our form
10:00 - if the Edit ID is present or is set so
10:06 - here at the form we need to make sure
10:11 - that the form s populated with the
10:17 - correct values so input type tags with
10:24 - our name I did this is for the input
10:27 - variable or input element ID so in here
10:32 - we need to display of course the idea of
10:37 - our user so print and then draw a user
10:41 - and then we're just going to get the ID
10:44 - and the same thing with the others
10:49 - so let's check for now values and
10:57 - instead of ID we're going to use name
11:01 - for this and also this we're going to
11:04 - use the email email value okay so I
11:14 - think that's pretty much it for this
11:16 - particular form so in the next video
11:18 - we're going to continue working on with
11:20 - this particular project and also this
11:22 - index dot PHP file to actually display
11:25 - all the users that we have inserted to
11:27 - our database so thank you for watching
