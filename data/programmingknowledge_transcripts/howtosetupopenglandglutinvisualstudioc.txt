00:01 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can configure and set
00:04 - up open G project in Visual Studio using
00:09 - C++ so first of all go to the link in
00:13 - the description and download a zip file
00:17 - attached there okay so go to the link in
00:21 - the description which I have provided
00:23 - and then download the zip file the zip
00:27 - file will look like this so I'm going to

00:37 - contain some folder and some dll
00:41 - files the two folder names are free glut
00:45 - and glue and the two dll files are free
00:49 - glut dodl and glue 32.dll
00:54 - okay so what you need to do is you need
00:57 - to uh extract the these uh files in some
01:03 - folder of your choice okay so what I'm
01:07 - going to do is I'm going to just extract
01:10 - these files in a folder okay so these
01:15 - files are in my folder which is there on
01:20 - the desktop and now I'm going to close
01:23 - my zip file and now I'm going to open my
01:27 - visual studio and in Visual Studio what
01:30 - I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
01:32 - new C++
01:34 - project so open new project and in C++
01:40 - select C++ and we are going to choose a
01:43 - empty project and we can change the name
01:46 - of uh our project
01:49 - as
01:50 - open
01:52 - G okay and make sure it's empty project
01:57 - and click okay and it's going to create
01:59 - create a empty project for
02:05 - us so once your project is created you
02:08 - need to go to your solution Explorer
02:11 - here and right click on your project so
02:15 - right click and we are going to create
02:18 - or add a new C++ file so right click and
02:23 - go to add and add a new item and we are
02:27 - going to select C++ file
02:30 - and we are going to name our file as
02:35 - main.cpp okay and click
02:40 - add and it's going to add this main.cpp
02:43 - to our source file
02:49 - okay now to set up open G in our Visual
02:53 - Studio project what I'm going to do is
02:55 - I'm going to right click my project so
02:58 - right click and go go to the
03:01 - properties and the
03:03 - properties first of all we will go to
03:06 - the property called c/ C++ okay and
03:11 - inside this we are going to go to the
03:14 - general properties and in here we are
03:17 - going to this category called additional
03:20 - include directories okay and I'm going
03:24 - to click this small little button and
03:27 - I'm going to open and here I'm going to
03:30 - click this button and I'm going to
03:32 - choose my
03:35 - folder in which I have extracted my
03:38 - files so I will go to that folder open
03:41 - GL and first of all I'm going to go to
03:45 - this free glut folder which I have
03:47 - downloaded and I will select include
03:49 - folder here and I will select folder
03:53 - okay same I will do for uh the glute 32
03:58 - folder so desktop open G and I'm going
04:02 - to go to
04:04 - glue and select
04:07 - include and select the folder okay so
04:12 - this has included these two uh you know
04:15 - Library files or folders to our
04:20 - directory path okay now what I'm going
04:23 - to do is I'm going to go to the category
04:26 - called
04:27 - Linker and inside this I'm going to to
04:30 - go to the category called input okay so
04:33 - go to Linker and go to input and in here
04:37 - go to additional dependencies and I'm
04:40 - going to add some additional
04:42 - dependencies and first of all the
04:45 - dependency which I'm going to add is so
04:48 - whenever uh you have downloaded you can
04:50 - see in your openg G there is a free glut
04:53 - dodl and glue. DL so we are going to add
04:58 - the same Library file related to these
05:01 - two DL first
05:03 - is free
05:07 - glut do
05:09 - lib and second
05:13 - is glue
05:16 - 32. lib okay and make sure that these
05:22 - matches this free glut and glue 32 the
05:27 - spelling matches okay
05:30 - and what this is going to do is this is
05:32 - going to add the libraries these
05:35 - libraries in your project so that you
05:39 - will be able to compile your program
05:42 - okay now what I'm going to do is in the
05:45 - same category Linker I'm going to go to
05:48 - the category called General and in this
05:54 - I'm going to go to the additional
05:57 - Library directory section and I'm going
06:00 - to add it it and now I'm going to
06:05 - add the library folder from those two
06:09 - folders so navigate this um folder open
06:14 - G and go to free glut and select Leb and
06:19 - select folder and same once again I'm
06:22 - going to do for the glue so open G glue
06:28 - lib select folder click okay and then
06:34 - apply and click okay okay and now once
06:40 - you do that what you need to do is now
06:44 - you can go to your project and right
06:47 - click it and you can open your folder of
06:52 - your project by clicking open folder in
06:55 - file explorer okay so once again right
06:58 - click your project and open folder in
07:01 - file explorer and this is going to open
07:04 - your project here okay
07:08 - and in here you can uh you know place
07:13 - your
07:14 - uh dll file which you have
07:17 - downloaded okay so that uh
07:21 - your executable file recognizes this D
07:25 - dll file and link to this dll file to a
07:29 - run your program
07:32 - okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
07:35 - going
07:36 - to take all the DL file which are fre
07:41 - free glad. DL and glue. DL from my
07:47 - folder where I have extracted them and I
07:50 - will copy these to dll file in my
07:52 - project folder so copy and into the
07:56 - project folder just paste
08:01 - okay so that uh any linking issue will
08:04 - be solved otherwise if it this doesn't
08:07 - work what you can do is the next option
08:11 - you can choose uh which is the most
08:15 - General options go to the C folder and
08:18 - then go
08:20 - to Windows I
08:23 - think and in Windows you can go to the
08:26 - system 32 folder and in this system 32
08:30 - folder you can paste copy and paste
08:33 - these two dll files and then any uh
08:37 - linking issues will be solved because
08:39 - this is the global uh location for all
08:43 - the dll files so that it will link
08:45 - directly your program will link directly
08:48 - to these tll files okay now once uh this
08:53 - is done what um remains is the program
08:58 - so in this um folder which I have given
09:02 - you in the zip file you have this base
09:06 - code file also so just open this file
09:10 - copy all the code from here this is the
09:12 - basic
09:14 - code to test whether our project is
09:18 - running or not okay and paste this code
09:22 - here and then we can run our code okay
09:26 - so what I'm going to do now is I'm going
09:29 - to to click this uh green button to run
09:35 - my project or build my project first and
09:37 - then run
09:41 - it and it's going to build my project
09:50 - first and now it's going to run my
09:56 - project and it says hello G
10:00 - so the sample program is doing nothing
10:03 - but it's uh creating a window uh which
10:06 - is a blank window just to test if this
10:09 - uh open GL library is set up properly or
10:14 - not okay so the purpose of this video is
10:17 - just to uh you know let you know how you
10:20 - can set up openg GL uh libraries with
10:23 - your Visual Studio IDE I hope you have
10:26 - enjoyed this video please wait comment
10:28 - and subscribe and and bye for now
