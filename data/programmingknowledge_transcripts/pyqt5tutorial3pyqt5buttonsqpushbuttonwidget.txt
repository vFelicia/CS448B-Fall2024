00:00 - hey guys welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge as discussed in the last
00:05 - tutorial we have created a window using
00:07 - this code using the mentioned code over
00:09 - here so by using this code we are going
00:12 - to add on a button inside the window
00:14 - let's go let's start off by creating the
00:18 - like by writing down the code the first
00:21 - thing we are going to do is you are
00:22 - going to use them Hugh push button which
00:25 - is which is we are going to input the to
00:27 - push button from PI 25.30 widgets then
00:32 - what we are going to do next to self
00:34 - door geometry will create a variable
00:37 - called button variable an object called
00:40 - button and inside the button we are
00:43 - going to use the cue push button which
00:47 - we have the important then and inside
00:51 - the brackets parenthesis or processes we
00:54 - are going to provide a name for this
00:57 - button let's say I am going to provide
01:00 - by qt5 button here we go we have defined
01:07 - the button name the next step what we
01:09 - are going to do is you are going to also
01:13 - use the self keyword so we have created
01:17 - the button now we are going to use this
01:20 - button and by using the search tool tip
01:24 - you are going to provide a name which is
01:27 - let us say this is an example button
01:34 - here we go we have defined it the next
01:39 - step what we are going to do is we are
01:40 - going to again use the button by using
01:42 - the dot move inside that you are going
01:46 - to provide a value of 100 comma 70 so we
01:50 - have set tooltip and we have also used
01:52 - the move and followed by once creating a
01:57 - button is done and action needs to be
02:00 - performed here in this tutorial I am
02:02 - going to do an action where whenever a
02:05 - user clicks on the button
02:07 - a text should be displayed for example
02:09 - when I'm clicking on the button of PI 25
02:13 - what will happen it will show it as pi
02:17 - QT v button click so I'm going to do
02:19 - that for doing that first we need to use
02:22 - the button which we have created
02:23 - followed by a dot operator and we need
02:27 - to use clicked and also we need to use
02:32 - dot and use the connect so inside the
02:38 - parentheses what we are going to do we
02:39 - are going to define the method name in
02:41 - which the method should contain the
02:44 - message which is pipe PI to defy button
02:48 - click so before that what we are going
02:51 - to do is like we are going to use the
02:56 - cell door show is already returned so we
03:01 - are going to create that method that
03:04 - needs to be defined or buttoned or
03:06 - clicked or connect inside the
03:07 - parenthesis for doing that we need a pie
03:10 - cutie slot so in order to do that we are
03:13 - going to import the pie to the slot from
03:17 - PI QT v dot QT Co importing in small
03:27 - letters PI 2 T slot and I am going to
03:31 - use this at PI Q T slot and inside this
03:40 - packet is God I am going to define the
03:45 - method which is on underscore click and
03:53 - inside that I am using the self 1 no
03:59 - here we go
04:00 - defined it so inside this on underscore
04:02 - clink what I'm going to do I'm going to
04:05 - provide my PI qt5 button click message
04:14 - so here we go we have defined the PI 25
04:19 - button click message over here now the
04:26 - main method has been defined and all the
04:30 - stuffs have been defined let's go make
04:32 - some changes in width and height to make
04:35 - sure that we get our required as
04:38 - expected let's say please only and 200
04:40 - I'm going to keep that and also okay so
04:45 - we have defined everything no let's go
04:48 - ahead and run the program and check for
04:51 - the required output
04:55 - now I'm going to run the program let's
04:59 - go ahead and run the program so here we
05:05 - go we have got the output of pi QT 5
05:08 - button and as you can see as for the
05:13 - code we have caught the output which is
05:15 - PI codify button inside the simple
05:17 - window and like one more thing needs to
05:22 - be done which is the button door click
05:24 - connect and so throat on click like
05:26 - whenever I'm clicking on the button PI Q
05:29 - d5 but until it should be displayed so
05:31 - let's now go ahead and run this one here
05:36 - we go whenever I am clicking on the
05:37 - button as you can see a message is
05:39 - displayed and that is coming from
05:41 - definition on click or cell sill or on
05:44 - click definition on click method so here
05:48 - we go whenever I am clicking on the
05:49 - button it's coming in along with that
05:51 - this is a window which we are defined
05:53 - and this is the title which we have
05:57 - defined by QT 5 button over here earlier
05:59 - we are define simple window in the last
06:02 - program so in this program we are
06:05 - different by default button so this
06:08 - the program will work so that's it for
06:11 - today thank you for joining me
06:12 - programming knowledge we'll see you in
06:14 - other tutorials with other stuffs like
06:17 - creating a text boxes and performing
06:20 - certain operations on it so bye guys
06:24 - have a good day
