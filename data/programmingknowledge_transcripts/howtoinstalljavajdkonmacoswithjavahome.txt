00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Java JDK
00:05 - on your Mac operating system first of
00:09 - all I'm going to show you how you can
00:11 - check whether Java is really installed
00:14 - on your Mac OS or not now there are two
00:18 - ways for checking it first is to open
00:21 - your system preferences there is this
00:25 - icon you can see here you can just click
00:29 - on this system preferences icon and it's
00:32 - going to open the system preferences for
00:35 - you right and you can see this is the
00:38 - System Preferences window and if you see
00:42 - a Java at the bottom of this window then
00:47 - Java is most probably installed on your
00:49 - system
00:50 - so if Java is installed on your system
00:52 - you will be able to see the Java I can
00:55 - like all these other icons in your
00:58 - system preferences right you can open
01:01 - system preferences from here also from
01:04 - this Apple icon and then you can just
01:08 - click system preferences is going to
01:10 - open the same right the second way is to
01:14 - check the Java version using the
01:16 - terminal now in order to open the
01:19 - terminal you can just open the spotlight
01:22 - using this search icon at the top you
01:25 - can see and then just write terminal and
01:29 - it's going to open the terminal
01:32 - I can so just click on this is going to
01:35 - open your terminal right now in here you
01:39 - just need to type Java and then -
01:43 - version and then + Enter is going to
01:47 - first of all give you this warning
01:50 - it says no Java Runtime present
01:53 - requesting install so this means that
01:57 - Java is not installed on my system and I
02:00 - need to install it and it's going to
02:03 - give me a pop-up window like this it
02:06 - says to use the Java command line tool
02:09 - you need to install a JDK so the
02:14 - the help of this pop-up window what we
02:16 - need to do is we just need to click this
02:19 - option which says more input so just
02:22 - click on this option which is more info
02:24 - which is going to open the Oracle
02:27 - website okay so you can see it has
02:31 - opened the Oracle website and in here
02:34 - just agree to the cookie conditions and
02:38 - then you will be able to see two buttons
02:43 - here one for Java and other for NetBeans
02:47 - with Java so what we need is this button
02:52 - which is for Java and the version of
02:55 - Java is this one right Java JDK we just
03:00 - need to click this button which says
03:01 - Java it is going to open this download
03:04 - page here now just scroll down a little
03:08 - and first of all you need to accept the
03:13 - license agreement so you just need to
03:16 - check this radio button so just check
03:20 - this radio button in front of accept
03:22 - license agreement and once this radio
03:25 - button is checked you can just scroll a
03:28 - little bit down and you will be able to
03:31 - see this option for Mac OS X okay so
03:35 - this is the option for Mac OS X and this
03:39 - is about 226 megabyte file and it's
03:44 - extension is dot dmg file okay so we
03:49 - need to install first of all download
03:52 - and then install using this file our
03:55 - Java JDK right so just click on this one
04:00 - which says the x64 dot dmg in front of
04:05 - micro X OS X and once you click this the
04:10 - download for this dmg file will start
04:12 - right now depending upon the speed of
04:16 - your your internet it's going to take
04:20 - few minutes right so I will wait for
04:24 - some time to download to compete
04:27 - and then we will see how we can install
04:31 - Java on our system so now this dmg file
04:36 - is downloaded so I am going to double
04:38 - click on this file so double click on
04:41 - the downloaded dmg file it's going to
04:44 - open the installation of this dmg file
04:50 - you can see the pop-up window will
04:53 - appear like this right let me minimize
04:55 - my browser so we can see it in a better
04:58 - way so now you have this kind of window
05:02 - opened when you double-click on the dmg
05:05 - file now it says double click on the
05:08 - icon to install so you just need to
05:10 - double click on this item to install it
05:13 - and now it's going to start installing
05:16 - the Java JDK 8 in my case at the time of
05:20 - making this video and you will see this
05:23 - kind of a window now you just need to
05:26 - click continue here and then it says
05:29 - install for all users of this computer
05:33 - so I just need just that so I will just
05:38 - click continue
05:39 - first of all select this and then click
05:41 - continue and now it says this will take
05:45 - around this much amount of space of your
05:50 - computer so if you you know agree then
05:53 - you just need to click install right and
05:56 - at the time of installing it will ask
06:01 - you to give your computer's password so
06:04 - whatever is the password of your Mac
06:07 - computer we just need to give it here so
06:10 - I'm going to give my password here and
06:12 - then I will click install software and
06:16 - now it will start installing the Java
06:21 - JDK software
06:32 - and now it says the installation was
06:34 - completed successfully right so once you
06:38 - see this message that means Java is
06:41 - installed successfully on your microwave
06:44 - you just need to close this window and
06:46 - to check this we are going to open our
06:49 - Center System Preferences once again so
06:52 - I'm going to just open the system
06:54 - preferences once again using this icon
06:56 - but this time I'm going to open it with
06:59 - this option in the under the Mac icon so
07:04 - System Preferences and you can see this
07:07 - Java icon here right and when you click
07:10 - on this job I can it's going to show you
07:12 - this kind of message the Java control
07:15 - panel opens in the separate of window
07:19 - right so you can just see this and you
07:24 - when you click on this you know icon you
07:28 - will be able to see this kind of Java
07:30 - control panel and then you will be able
07:33 - to see general information of your java
07:36 - software you can see if there is any
07:40 - update or not and then you can see some
07:44 - of the other features of Java so you can
07:47 - see view and manage Java Runtime version
07:50 - so if you want to use Java Runtime
07:52 - version you can view like this so we
07:56 - have the 1.8 platform the product is 1.8
08:01 - point zero point something the location
08:04 - is this one so you can see the Java JDK
08:09 - and one time is installed at this
08:13 - location you can just see this location
08:16 - or you can just copy this location and
08:18 - we can verify that Java is really
08:20 - installed at this location right so what
08:24 - I'm going to do is I will just leave it
08:27 - as opened and I'm going to just minimize
08:30 - the fifth System Preferences just and
08:33 - let let's just minimize this one also
08:37 - I'm going to just cancel it for now and
08:38 - minimize it
08:40 - ah now right now I also told you that
08:43 - you can also verify the Java version
08:46 - using the terminal so once again open
08:50 - the terminal so if you give the same
08:53 - command on the same on older terminal
08:56 - before installing the you know Java you
08:59 - have open this terminal and once you see
09:02 - it will show you this kind of you know
09:06 - version of the Java and you can now see
09:10 - the Java version so it says Java version
09:13 - 1.8 right once again you can also check
09:17 - the Java compiler by using Java C -
09:21 - version and then press ENTER it's also
09:24 - going to give you the version of Java C
09:28 - so now Java is installed successfully on
09:32 - your Mac OS now one thing remains is the
09:37 - setting of Java home environment
09:40 - variable and this is also very important
09:43 - so what we are going to do is I'm going
09:46 - to just clear the terminal for now and
09:48 - first of all I will switch to my home
09:51 - directory by the way I'm already in my
09:54 - home directory but if you are not if you
09:58 - are not in your home directory you just
09:59 - need to switch it to your home directory
10:02 - whatever is your home directory in and
10:04 - if you don't know how to do it you just
10:07 - need to just press this tilde and then
10:11 - the forward slash and before this you
10:14 - just need to write CD tilde /n + just
10:19 - that enter and you will be in your home
10:23 - folder right and I'm going to just LS in
10:26 - to this folder
10:27 - which is going to list all the
10:29 - directories and file in this folder so
10:32 - to check whether the Java home is really
10:35 - set on your microwave so you just need
10:39 - to write this command echo and then
10:42 - dollar symbol and then Java underscore
10:46 - home all in capital and if it does not
10:50 - give any output here then Java home is
10:54 - I said so for this what you need to do
10:57 - is first of all you just need to do LS -
11:01 - al here so it it is going to show you
11:04 - all the hidden and hidden file also to
11:08 - the governor I must give I left - al
11:12 - right and then press enter and I can see
11:15 - in my home folder all these files and
11:19 - directories right so I can see dot
11:22 - history dot bash history is there dot
11:25 - bash underscore session is there these
11:28 - are all the hidden files with the dot
11:31 - extension now generally we set our Java
11:36 - home environment variable in the dot
11:40 - Bash underscore profile file but for the
11:45 - first time if you don't see this file in
11:47 - this list then you just need to create
11:50 - this file so if this file is not present
11:54 - don't worry you just can just create
11:56 - this file which is dot bash underscore
11:59 - profile so we are going to just create
12:02 - this file I am going to clear the
12:04 - terminal and I'm in the same directory
12:06 - right so I'm going to just write touch
12:10 - and touch is used to create files right
12:13 - and I'm going to create this file dot
12:16 - hash underscore profile okay we just
12:21 - need to create this file and then press
12:23 - Enter it is going to create this file we
12:26 - can just do LS - al once again and now
12:30 - you can see this dot bash underscore
12:34 - profile is created right now inside this
12:38 - dot underscore profile we just need to
12:41 - export the Java variable right so what
12:46 - you need to do is you can just open this
12:48 - dot profile bash profile in an editor so
12:53 - you can just write open - e to open this
12:58 - file in our editor and then just write a
13:00 - bash underscore profile and then press
13:04 - Enter it is going to open this dot bash
13:08 - while in an editor right and you just
13:11 - need to give this command here which is
13:16 - export Java underscore home all in you
13:22 - know capital so Java underscore home is
13:24 - in capital and then is equal to then the
13:28 - dollar symbol and then in the brackets
13:31 - you just need to give power slash user
13:34 - power /lib e XE c four slash Java
13:41 - underscore home in smaller and then
13:44 - close your blanket okay so you just need
13:48 - to do this in order to set your java
13:53 - variable I will just paste this text in
13:58 - the description also so that you can
14:01 - just copy this and just paste it in your
14:04 - dot a bash underscore profile file ok so
14:08 - just get this come on and then save it
14:11 - so I'm going to just save it you can
14:15 - save it from here also just go to file
14:18 - and click save and then close this file
14:21 - ok and now you just need to close the
14:24 - terminal also once again and I'm going
14:27 - to minimize this and once again I'm
14:30 - going to open the terminal so I'm going
14:33 - to first of all quit this terminal so
14:36 - I'm going to just quit so this is the
14:39 - old terminal on which I was working I am
14:41 - going to open the new terminal in order
14:45 - to see the changes right so just open
14:48 - the new terminal and now I'm going to
14:52 - just give the same command echo and then
14:55 - dollar Java underscore ok and then press
15:01 - ENTER and now you can see this location
15:05 - which is the location for your Java home
15:09 - environment variable which is site
15:11 - automatically by that command which we
15:15 - have pasted in our bash underscore
15:18 - profile file so now the Java JDK
15:22 - and GRE is fully installed on your
15:24 - system with this Java home environment
15:27 - variable I hope you've enjoyed this
