00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we are going to see how to use
00:06 - tuples in Python so first of all what
00:10 - are tuples
00:10 - so tuples are very similar to lists that
00:14 - is they are used to store the collection
00:17 - of elements in a single variable but
00:20 - there is a very important difference
00:22 - between them and that difference is
00:24 - tuples are immutable immutable means
00:29 - once tuples are created they cannot be
00:33 - changed or the content in them cannot be
00:36 - changed so let's see how we can declare
00:39 - a couple so I'm going to declare a
00:41 - variable called X and I'm going to
00:43 - assign some values to it now in case of
00:47 - list we have seen we used the square
00:50 - brackets in the case of tuples we use
00:53 - these parentheses in order to store the
00:55 - list of elements so I can just write 1 5
00:59 - 3 4 and 8 for example and then press
01:04 - ENTER and it's going to create a tuple
01:07 - now in order to print the tupple you can
01:09 - use x and it's going to print this table
01:12 - now as I said tuples are similar to
01:15 - lists in some ways and that means you
01:17 - can call a tuple element by index in
01:22 - tupple so all the tuple elements are
01:25 - arranged by their index and when you
01:28 - want to for example get the first
01:32 - element here you give the index 0 and
01:34 - then press ENTER and it's going to give
01:37 - you the value which is saved at index 0
01:41 - let's get the value which is saved at
01:44 - index 4 and I am going to press ENTER
01:47 - and you can see it gives 8 which is
01:49 - saved at index 4 now when I try to give
01:53 - an index which is not there for example
01:55 - 100 it's going to give us error which
01:58 - says index error tuple index out of
02:01 - range now as I said tuples are immutable
02:04 - that is you cannot change the content of
02:06 - a tuple if they are initialized once so
02:10 - let's try to test this so I'm going to
02:12 - just
02:13 - sign the value at index zero which is
02:16 - let's say two and I'm going to press
02:18 - ENTER and you can see it says type error
02:22 - tuple object does not support item
02:25 - assignment that is you cannot assign any
02:29 - other value to a tuple element if they
02:34 - are once initialized now that also means
02:37 - that you cannot use some of the
02:39 - functions which you used with list in
02:42 - the tuples for example you cannot remove
02:45 - any element you cannot append any
02:47 - element you cannot change any element so
02:51 - for example when I write X here and then
02:53 - press dot you can see there are few
02:56 - methods which are available with the
03:00 - tupple and most important is this count
03:03 - method so let's try to use this count
03:05 - method and I want to know how many
03:07 - number of eight which are there in this
03:11 - tuple and it will give me one because
03:13 - eight is only present once in this
03:15 - couple if it is present twice in this
03:17 - couple here you will see the result too
03:20 - now in order to get the length of the
03:22 - tuple you can use the inbuilt function
03:24 - which is a Lian and then the tupple name
03:27 - and then press ENTER and it's going to
03:29 - give you the length of the tuples
03:31 - now in the previous video I have told
03:32 - you that you can save multiple data type
03:36 - values in lists let's see if we can do
03:39 - the same with tuples or not so I'm going
03:42 - to give the parentheses I'm going to
03:44 - give the first value as integer second
03:46 - value as string third value as for
03:50 - example the decimal value and I'm going
03:54 - to press ENTER and I'm going to get the
03:57 - value of y and you can see it's totally
04:00 - possible to save multiple data type
04:03 - values in our table so now I have
04:06 - declared two tuples one is X and other
04:09 - is why so let's print X and Y's once
04:12 - again very quickly and now what we want
04:15 - to do is we want to use a concatenation
04:18 - operators so as I said tuples are
04:21 - immutable but let me define a third
04:24 - tuple here and I want to add
04:27 - Exce tapu and white apple here and i
04:30 - want to assign the value to z is it
04:33 - possible let's check so I'm going to
04:35 - just once again see the contents in the
04:39 - Z variable and you can see when you use
04:42 - this plus operator or concatenation
04:46 - operator it's going to join these two
04:48 - tupple and create a new tuple with the
04:52 - combination of the values of both these
04:55 - tuples now there is one interesting
04:57 - thing which you can do with a tuple
04:59 - which is you can declare a variable and
05:02 - let me define a tuple with only one
05:06 - element and I'm going to just give high
05:09 - here and then after this element I'm
05:11 - going to provide comma here so this is
05:14 - important I have provided this comma and
05:16 - I haven't provided the second element in
05:19 - the tuple and I can use an S tricks here
05:23 - and I can use some value here so let's
05:26 - say I have provided five here and I'm
05:28 - going to press ENTER and then I'm going
05:31 - to see the values inside this a variable
05:34 - and now you can see hi string is saved
05:38 - five times in a variable in the form of
05:42 - a tuple so you can once again get this
05:45 - value at index two for example and it's
05:48 - going to give you the value which is
05:50 - stored at index two which is high itself
05:52 - you can also use inbuilt function called
05:55 - Max here to get the maximum value out of
05:59 - a tuples so Max and I have provided X
06:02 - couple here and you will be able to see
06:04 - it will give us the maximum value stored
06:07 - in that tuples and you can see here it
06:10 - is the maximum value which is there
06:12 - inside the tupple we can also get the
06:14 - minimum value using mi and function and
06:18 - it's going to give you the minimum value
06:20 - which is stored inside the tuple and
06:21 - also you can use our de l function to
06:24 - delete our tuples so let's say I want to
06:26 - delete this tuple which is Z here so I
06:29 - can just write the name of the tuple
06:31 - after the ELN space and then press enter
06:34 - and now once again when I try to get the
06:37 - value of said it's going to give me
06:39 - error which says name
06:40 - is not defined so in order to delete the
06:43 - tupple you can use that de l function so
06:46 - this is how you can use tuples in Python
06:49 - I hope you have enjoyed this video and I
06:51 - will see you in the next video
