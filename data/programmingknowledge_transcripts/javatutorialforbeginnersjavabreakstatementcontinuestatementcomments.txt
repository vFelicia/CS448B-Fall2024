00:00 - hello and welcome back guys to the
00:01 - another video of the Java tutorial
00:03 - Series so guys this is the uh I guess
00:06 - last video of the control statements so
00:08 - wherein we will be talking about Java
00:10 - break Java continue and what are Java
00:13 - comments okay so let's just get started
00:17 - okay so what is Java break so Java break
00:20 - is a statement which is used to break a
00:22 - loop or a switch statement it breaks the
00:25 - current flow of the program at specified
00:27 - condition in case of the inner loop it
00:30 - breaks only the inner loop okay so here
00:33 - is a
00:34 - diagrammatic representation here you can
00:36 - see one Loop is going on it it is
00:41 - iterating and one condition is defined
00:43 - inside that Loop and if that condition
00:45 - becomes true uh we will declare a break
00:49 - statement there and it will break the
00:51 - flow of the loop and it will terminate
00:54 - that Loop okay and whenever that
00:57 - condition is evaluated as false the loop
00:59 - will again go and iterate iterate
01:01 - iterate until the specified condition
01:03 - becomes false okay
01:05 - so what is Java continue okay so Java
01:09 - continue statement is used to continue
01:11 - the loop it continues the current flow
01:13 - of the program and skips the remaining
01:15 - code at a specified condition in case of
01:18 - an inner loop it will continue the inner
01:20 - loop only okay so we'll be uh talking in
01:23 - depth when we are going to code this
01:25 - Java continue
01:27 - and at last Java comments are there so
01:30 - what are the documents the Java comments
01:32 - are the statements in a program that are
01:34 - not executed by a compiler and an
01:36 - interpreter so basically there are three
01:38 - types of the Java comments one is single
01:41 - line command multi-line comment and
01:42 - documentation command so what is single
01:44 - line comment the single line comment is
01:46 - used to comment only one line so to
01:49 - declare a comment inside Java Java
01:51 - program we will just write two forward
01:54 - slashes are there so when you when you
01:57 - declare two two forward slashes and
01:59 - after that whatever you you will write
02:01 - that will be interpreted interpreted as
02:03 - a comment in Java okay so what is
02:06 - multi-line the multi-line comment is
02:08 - used to comment a multiple lines of the
02:10 - code so when you when we are you are
02:12 - going to comment out the multiple lines
02:15 - of the code in Java then you can use
02:18 - multi-line code multi-line comments
02:20 - sorry and third one is documentation
02:22 - command so documentation comment is used
02:25 - to create a documentation API to create
02:28 - documentation API you need to use Java
02:30 - doc tool so we'll be discussing more
02:33 - about documentation uh comments in our
02:36 - upcoming videos when we are writing some
02:39 - code that is a production level code
02:41 - okay so let's code it
02:44 - now it's I will come here inside my IDE
02:47 - and I will create one Java class name
02:51 - break
02:54 - okay and let me just increase the font
02:58 - size
02:59 - and I will tell you and give you one
03:02 - simple example of the break okay
03:05 - and here I am writing one for Loop which
03:08 - will iterate when I is equals to 1 and I
03:13 - is less than equals to 10 and each time
03:16 - my Loop is increment ice value is
03:18 - incrementing by one
03:20 - okay so inside this
03:24 - sorry guys I'll get I'm getting errors
03:27 - because I forgot to
03:30 - write the main method and I should write
03:33 - all this code inside the main method my
03:35 - bad
03:36 - and inside this for loop I will declare
03:39 - one if statement and I will write that
03:42 - when I is equals to equals to 5
03:46 - simply break
03:49 - okay
03:50 - and other than that
03:52 - if I come out of this Loop
03:56 - I will print the value of the eye okay
04:01 - now if I click on run
04:04 - so here you can see one two three four
04:08 - is going to print it on the screen and
04:10 - when the value value of the I is
04:12 - incremented and when the value of the is
04:13 - becomes 5 it will check whether the 5 is
04:16 - less than 10 it yes it come inside the
04:19 - loop and it will check I is equal to
04:20 - equal to 5 yes it will break the loop it
04:24 - will break the for Loop and it will get
04:26 - out of that Loop so this the this is the
04:29 - situation where you can use the for Loop
04:31 - inside Java okay
04:37 - okay so we have discussed about break
04:40 - now
04:41 - we will see what is
04:45 - continue in Java okay
04:48 - so let me just copy out this code
04:51 - because I need this okay and add this I
04:55 - will instead of writing break I will
04:58 - write
04:59 - continue okay and I will
05:02 - I will execute the same code okay so
05:05 - here you can see
05:07 - what is going to get printed on the
05:09 - console is one two three four and five
05:12 - is skipped and six seven eight nine ten
05:16 - is printed on the console why so when
05:19 - the value of the is becomes 5 when I is
05:22 - equal to equal to 5 this if condition
05:24 - gets evaluated as true and continue this
05:28 - line number 11 is executed and what will
05:31 - continue will do it will skip that
05:34 - iteration for that Loop it will not
05:36 - execute any of the code after the line
05:39 - number 11 and it will skip that Loop and
05:41 - it will go for the incrementing of the
05:43 - value of the I and iel's value become 6
05:45 - and 6 is less than 10 and that's why 6A
05:48 - is going to get printed on the console
05:49 - okay so continue is used basically for
05:52 - to skip a particular iteration inside a
05:55 - loop
05:56 - okay so I hope you guys have understood
05:58 - this
06:00 - continue so last topic that we have
06:04 - remaining is Java comments
06:07 - okay so let me just give you some
06:10 - example of the comments so as you can
06:14 - see these are the single line comments
06:16 - okay so here uh comments and I will just
06:20 - explain you okay so this is uh
06:25 - single line
06:28 - comment
06:30 - in Java
06:32 - right now my ID is throwing so much
06:35 - error because this is not a Java code
06:38 - this is just a simple English statement
06:41 - so if I want to comment this out I will
06:44 - just come here and just put two forward
06:48 - slashes and this that this becomes a
06:51 - single line comment inside Java okay
06:55 - so let's suppose we have to declare a
06:58 - multi-line comment Okay so
07:01 - I will write like this this is a
07:06 - multi
07:08 - line
07:11 - comment
07:13 - Angel so here two lines are there line
07:17 - number 17 and line number 18 are there
07:19 - that we have to comment so in that case
07:21 - we will write one forward slash followed
07:24 - by one asterisk and after when the at
07:29 - line number 18th end will write asterisk
07:33 - and one forward slash so guys this is
07:36 - the example of the multi-line comments
07:38 - inside Java so
07:42 - now it when we talk about the
07:45 - documentation comment there are a lot
07:49 - more example of the document coming
07:50 - documentation comments are there that is
07:53 - at author add code at version tag so
07:57 - these are some tags which are used in a
07:58 - multi-line command we will be discussing
08:00 - it in our upcoming videos when we saw uh
08:03 - some high level hard level uh Java
08:06 - programs and in that we will create a
08:09 - documentation comments okay so that is
08:13 - it for this video guys and now we have
08:16 - officially
08:17 - uh discussed all the topics which are
08:21 - comes under the control statements in
08:22 - Java so in the next class onward we will
08:25 - be starting our oops Concepts in Java
08:28 - and one more thing guys uh I'll be
08:31 - giving you this exercise number two in
08:33 - upcoming videos depending uh it the
08:36 - question that are asked in this exercise
08:38 - is whatever I tell I taught you to form
08:42 - till till now then on that on those
08:45 - topics that is for Loop while loop do
08:47 - while Loops all these topics requires as
08:50 - a prerequisite to solve that exercise so
08:52 - I hope guys I hope you guys will uh
08:55 - solve that exercise and meet you soon
08:57 - thank you
