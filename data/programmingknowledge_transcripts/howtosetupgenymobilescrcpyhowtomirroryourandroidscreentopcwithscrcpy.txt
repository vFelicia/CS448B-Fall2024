00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install and
00:04 - use an application called screen copy on
00:07 - your Windows 10 operating system so
00:10 - screen copy is a free and open source
00:13 - screen mirroring application that allows
00:16 - control of Android devices from Windows
00:20 - Mac OS or Linux operating systems so
00:24 - basically you use screen copy to mirror
00:26 - your Android devices on your operating
00:29 - system so I'm going to demonstrate it on
00:32 - our Windows 10 operating system so to
00:35 - download screen copy what you need to do
00:38 - is you just need to go to your favorite
00:40 - browser and search for SCR cpy the short
00:43 - form of screen copy is this one so just
00:46 - search for SCR cpy and in the search
00:49 - result you will see this github link so
00:52 - this project is hosted on the github so
00:55 - you just need to click the github link
00:58 - which you see in the result I will put
01:00 - this link in the description of this
01:02 - video also now if you want to know more
01:05 - about this project and screen copy you
01:09 - can just scroll down where you see
01:11 - readme dot MD and you can see more
01:16 - details about how to use this how to
01:18 - install the screen copy on your
01:21 - operating system so I'm going to go
01:23 - little bit down where you will see get
01:27 - the app section and you can see you can
01:31 - get it on Linux Windows or Mac operating
01:34 - system so we are interested in
01:37 - installing this application on our
01:39 - Windows operating system so I'm going to
01:42 - choose this windows option and you will
01:45 - see this zip file which is for the
01:48 - 64-bit operating system so I'm going to
01:50 - just click on this zip file which is
01:53 - going to be downloaded on my Windows
01:56 - operating system so I will wait for the
01:57 - download to complete so once this zip
02:00 - file is downloaded you just need to go
02:02 - to the location where this is a file is
02:04 - downloaded and just cut this zip file
02:08 - and move this zip file where
02:11 - ever you feel comfortable with using the
02:14 - command prompt so what I generally do is
02:17 - I will just go to my C Drive and inside
02:20 - my C Drive I will just create a folder
02:24 - with the name SC R cpy and then in this
02:29 - SCR cpy folder I'm going to just paste
02:32 - this zip file and then extract this zip
02:36 - file here so right click and then
02:38 - extract this file in the same folder in
02:42 - the SCR cpy in the c directory and after
02:46 - that you don't need this zip file so you
02:48 - can remove this file also and then what
02:53 - you need to do is you just need to run
02:54 - this scr cpy executable file using
02:58 - command prompt so if you go to the
03:00 - documentation page once again and when
03:03 - you scroll down the usage is really
03:06 - simple you just need to plug your
03:08 - Android device to your computer and then
03:11 - run this SCR cpy command so we are going
03:16 - to do just that so what I'm going to do
03:18 - is I'm going to first of all connect my
03:22 - Android phone to my Windows operating
03:24 - system using a USB cable as you just
03:29 - normally do when you want to charge your
03:31 - phone with your Windows operating system
03:35 - or any other operating system so you
03:37 - just need to allow the access to your
03:39 - Android phone on your windows operating
03:42 - system so generally this will be just a
03:46 - pop-up window on your Android device and
03:48 - you just need to say yes I want to grant
03:51 - access right so once your Android device
03:55 - is connected to your Windows operating
03:57 - system what you need to do is you just
03:59 - need to copy this path where you have
04:02 - this SCR cpy executable file and then
04:07 - open the command prompt so just search
04:09 - for CMD in the search bar and then run
04:12 - your command prompt as administrator so
04:15 - right click and run as administrator and
04:18 - once your command prompt open you can CD
04:21 - to the directory where your s
04:24 - ERCP by executable is there so once you
04:28 - are inside that directory you just need
04:30 - to run the scr cpy come on so I'm going
04:33 - to just write SCR cpy here and then
04:37 - press ENTER and once I do that I can see
04:41 - my Android phone screen which is
04:44 - mirrored on my Windows operating system
04:47 - so I can just open this Android device
04:51 - and then I can go to the Google Play
04:55 - Store and here when I just do something
04:59 - on my Android device its mirrored on my
05:04 - Windows operating system also so this is
05:08 - that easy to just mirror your android
05:11 - device on your Windows operating system
05:15 - or any other operating system using SCR
05:19 - cpy now I'm going to give you few more
05:22 - tips about SCR cpy so what I want to
05:28 - show you is let me just close this
05:31 - mirroring and right now we have to go to
05:36 - the SCR cpy directory in order to run
05:40 - this command if you want to run it from
05:43 - anywhere from your Windows operating
05:46 - system what you need to do is you just
05:48 - need to set this path to your
05:50 - environment variable and most of you
05:53 - might already know how to do this but
05:56 - for those who don't know you just need
05:58 - to go to the settings and then in the
06:02 - system you just need to search for
06:04 - environment variables or just type env
06:07 - and some letters of environment
06:10 - variables and just choose this option
06:13 - which is called added the system
06:15 - environment variable and then click on
06:18 - environment variables and then here in
06:22 - your system environment variables go to
06:25 - the path environment variable which is
06:28 - this one and then double click on it or
06:30 - just click on edit button and then click
06:33 - on new and then paste the path of the
06:37 - SCRC
06:38 - so wherever you have copied your strcpy
06:43 - files you just need to just copy the
06:46 - directory path and then paste it here so
06:49 - I have pasted this part here and then
06:52 - I'm going to just click on OK and then
06:55 - click on OK and then click on OK and
06:57 - once I am done with that I need to
07:00 - restart my command prompt so I'm going
07:02 - to just restart my command prompt buzz
07:04 - by just typing CMD here and then just
07:08 - run it as administrator and you can see
07:13 - right now I'm in the different directory
07:16 - I'm not in my screen copy directory but
07:20 - still when I give here a CRC p/y command
07:24 - and then press ENTER it runs and show me
07:27 - my android screen right so this is how
07:32 - you can set the environment variables
07:34 - for SCR cpy I'm going to just close this
07:38 - once again now in case you face any
07:42 - problem related to the mirroring of your
07:45 - Android device on your operating system
07:48 - using screen copy you just need to
07:51 - enable your USB debugging on your
07:53 - Android device so let me show you how
07:55 - you can enable your USB debugging on
07:59 - your Android device if you face any
08:01 - problem so once again I'm going to just
08:03 - show my android screen by SCR a-c-p Y
08:08 - command so you can see my Android device
08:12 - and then you just need to go to the
08:15 - settings here in order to enable the USB
08:17 - debugging so once the settings open you
08:20 - just need to go at the very bottom where
08:23 - it says about phone and click on about
08:25 - phone and then just go to the build
08:28 - number and press it a few times so after
08:32 - pressing few times you will see that the
08:34 - developer option will be enabled on your
08:37 - Android device so when you go back you
08:40 - will see this developer option which
08:43 - will be enabled so just click on the
08:46 - developer option go inside that and make
08:49 - sure that this top there
08:52 - per option has been enabled so you just
08:54 - need to enable the top developer option
08:57 - and then you also need to make sure that
09:02 - under debugging section your USB
09:04 - debugging is on so you need to enable
09:07 - this if it's not enabled so just make
09:11 - sure that you have enabled your USB
09:13 - debugging and then you just enable all
09:17 - the options related to USB debugging
09:21 - okay so if you do that definitely this
09:25 - method is going to work on your Android
09:29 - device so this is how you can download
09:31 - and install a screen copy on your
09:34 - Windows operating system and mirror your
09:36 - android device on Windows operating
09:39 - system or any other operating system
09:41 - using screen copy I hope you've enjoyed
09:44 - this video and I will see you in the
09:46 - next video
09:54 - you
