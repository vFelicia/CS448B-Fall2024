00:00 - now in this video we will talk about
00:02 - like one of the basic command that is mv
00:04 - command it like it basically stands for
00:07 - move
00:08 - so basically in this video we will talk
00:09 - about how we can move files from one
00:11 - location to another or also you can say
00:15 - like how we can move directly from one
00:17 - location to another location okay
00:20 - so today in this video we are gonna
00:21 - learn about this and i like how we can
00:24 - move files from one location to another
00:25 - so first of all let me open up the
00:27 - terminal
00:30 - and now let me just to increase the font
00:33 - size for you guys so it should be
00:35 - visible to you and i will just open up
00:37 - these files
00:39 - for your reference
00:40 - so whatever we will perform it will be
00:43 - visible to you guys okay
00:48 - okay
00:49 - so
00:51 - now what i will do
00:52 - first of all i will create one directory
00:54 - mkdir
00:56 - move move command okay
01:00 - and now what we will need to do
01:03 - let me clear
01:05 - i will move into that particular
01:07 - directory and i will create one file
01:10 - touch here
01:13 - file one dot txt we will create okay
01:17 - and let us touch file one dot txt okay
01:21 - uh
01:23 - also let me
01:25 - know wait a minute
01:29 - i will try to create a file with for cat
01:32 - command because i have to write
01:34 - something in it
01:39 - this is
01:40 - file one
01:43 - ctrl d okay now it is save
01:46 - now uh what we will do
01:49 - i have to move this file one dot txt
01:53 - okay
01:54 - five one dot txt from this move would
01:57 - have move comma directly to some another
02:00 - directory
02:01 - that is i have to move this on to
02:03 - suppose desktop okay
02:05 - so now what i will do
02:08 - first of all i will open up one more
02:10 - terminal
02:12 - and
02:16 - i will move into the cd desktop
02:19 - okay
02:20 - i will do pwd i will check the like path
02:23 - of that particular desktop where it is
02:27 - so here you can see
02:29 - home i use desktop okay
02:32 - so now what we will do
02:35 - i will use here
02:37 - mv
02:39 - and like stands for move i have to move
02:42 - file one dot txt
02:44 - to
02:45 - home
02:47 - i
02:48 - use
02:50 - desktop and here what you can do like
02:53 - like this command is also useful like
02:56 - changing
02:58 - the name like we can also rename files
03:00 - okay but here i'm going to use only file
03:04 - dot txt okay
03:07 - and i will hit enter and
03:10 - on the desktop i will do here ls so here
03:12 - you will see file.txt has been
03:16 - like created okay
03:18 - or
03:20 - you can see here also on the desktop
03:24 - i think it is
03:27 - here here you can see the file.txt has
03:30 - been
03:31 - created okay
03:35 - so uh this is the basics of how we can
03:38 - move files from one location to another
03:41 - now like this command is also useful in
03:43 - renaming files okay so if i will do lsa
03:46 - so there is nothing because we have
03:47 - already moved it uh let's create another
03:49 - file
03:51 - cat
03:52 - file 2
03:55 - dot txt
03:57 - this is
03:58 - file to
04:00 - okay
04:01 - and yes and now what i want i want to
04:03 - rename this file file to i want to make
04:05 - it file three
04:07 - so we can do it mv file to
04:10 - same
04:12 - here i will do just file
04:14 - 3.txt and i will do a list and here you
04:16 - will see the name of the file 2 has been
04:18 - changed to
04:20 - file 3. now let's check the content
04:23 - for file 3 whether it is same or not so
04:25 - cat file 3 so it is this is file two
04:28 - okay
04:30 - so in this way you can also rename the
04:32 - like file names okay
04:35 - i hope you got it
04:36 - uh now let me tell you one more another
04:39 - thing like
04:41 - if suppose uh
04:43 - here is file.txt okay on the desktop
04:46 - and
04:48 - you want to move that
04:50 - file one which is here
04:52 - to move into this particular directory
04:55 - or particular location
04:57 - so if
04:58 - already file1.txt
05:00 - like
05:02 - exist here so
05:04 - what will happen when we will
05:07 - like try to move files from this
05:10 - location to this location with the same
05:12 - and then it will overwrite so to
05:14 - overcome overcome this issue what we
05:16 - will use we will use hyphen i command
05:19 - not command hyphen flag we will use
05:22 - okay first what i will do i will
05:24 - [Music]
05:26 - uh
05:27 - change the file name to file one
05:30 - not file one file.txt i will change
05:34 - ls okay now what i will do mb file dot
05:38 - txt then
05:41 - home
05:42 - i use
05:44 - desktop and again file dot
05:48 - txt and here i will use hyphen i option
05:54 - and here you can see override do you
05:55 - want to override this particular file
05:57 - which it exists it is asking so i can
06:00 - say yes or no but before let's check the
06:02 - content of this file
06:05 - this is file 180 it is showing now i
06:07 - will do yes
06:09 - and
06:12 - hit enter
06:16 - and now i will
06:18 - again
06:22 - check the content of this file so here
06:24 - you can see this is file too
06:26 - okay i hope it is visible to you yeah
06:28 - this is this file too now
06:31 - the like uh decent content of this file
06:35 - because it is overwritten okay
06:38 - now next uh whatever i have to do
06:42 - i will try to move
06:45 - like
06:46 - some files into one particular directory
06:49 - okay
06:50 - so what i will do i will
06:52 - create uh two files
06:55 - one dot txt
06:57 - two dot txt
06:59 - now let's create a text also okay now
07:02 - you can say ls
07:03 - so these are the theme which we have
07:04 - created now i will
07:07 - make a directory here on the desktop
07:09 - mkdir
07:12 - uh move files
07:15 - okay now what i will do mb
07:19 - one dot txt two dot txt three dot txt
07:23 - into the
07:25 - directory home
07:26 - i use
07:28 - desktop on desktop what we have
07:33 - move files
07:34 - we'll hit enter
07:36 - and we will do ls so here we can see
07:38 - there is no any files here
07:40 - now i will move into the move files and
07:42 - i will do ls so here you can see all the
07:44 - files has been
07:46 - like moved at this particular locations
07:48 - okay
07:49 - so uh this is the another way to like
07:52 - moving files from one location to
07:54 - another like from
07:56 - one location to any kind of directory in
07:58 - which you want okay
08:00 - now moving forward uh what we can do uh
08:03 - like
08:04 - how you can copy
08:07 - like one directory to another location
08:10 - okay or renaming it okay
08:14 - so let me go back here
08:16 - and
08:17 - now at desktop here you can see move
08:19 - files
08:21 - and one directory that is test directory
08:23 - okay
08:24 - now what i want i want to first
08:28 - rename this file
08:30 - uh this directory
08:32 - so move files i will try to rename it
08:37 - m files
08:40 - now let's so here you can see the
08:43 - like move files have been changed to
08:44 - impulse now what now i want to move this
08:47 - m files into this tester directory
08:50 - uh so what i can do i
08:53 - mv
08:55 - m files
08:57 - and in the test
09:00 - enter unless there is no m files here
09:04 - now cd chain directed to test now let's
09:07 - do a list
09:10 - and here you can see m files has been
09:12 - moved at this particular location or you
09:15 - can say add the test directory
09:18 - okay
09:19 - so in this way uh like you can move
09:21 - files from one location to another or
09:24 - from
09:25 - one directory to another or how you can
09:27 - also
09:28 - rename files and also in this video
