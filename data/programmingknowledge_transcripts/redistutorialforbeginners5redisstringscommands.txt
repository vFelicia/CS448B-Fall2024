00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - reddis tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last few videos we have seen how we can
00:06 - download and install reddis on our
00:08 - Windows Linux and Mac operating system
00:12 - now further videos I will be making on
00:15 - my Linux operating system that is my
00:18 - Ubuntu operating system because more
00:21 - frequently or most frequently This redis
00:24 - Server is installed on a Linux machine
00:28 - and it's used from a Linux machine so
00:31 - it's will be more appropriate to go
00:34 - further with this Linux operating system
00:36 - but all the command which I'm will be
00:39 - using on this Linux operating system
00:41 - using the command line are applicable on
00:43 - the Windows terminal also and the Mac
00:46 - terminal also so the command will not
00:49 - change and you just need to start the
00:51 - reddis server and reddis CLI on your
00:54 - Windows or Mac OS and then follow these
00:58 - uh instruction which I'm giving
01:00 - on my Y 2 operating system so if you are
01:03 - on Windows or Mac you just need to
01:06 - follow the same uh steps you just need
01:08 - to open two terminals on your operating
01:12 - system it can be Mac or uh it can be uh
01:16 - your windows and of course the Linux and
01:20 - on one terminal you just need to start
01:23 - the redis server so I'm going to just
01:27 - start the redis server here and on the
01:30 - other one you just need to start the
01:33 - reddis CLI okay so looks simple right
01:38 - the same step you need to do on your
01:40 - windows or your Mac okay so once our
01:43 - server is running we can uh minimize
01:46 - this and start working to interact with
01:49 - this server using the redish CLI okay
01:54 - now let's start with the data types
01:57 - which are there in redis and and then we
02:00 - will see how we can use one of the data
02:03 - type which is string so basically there
02:06 - are five data types which we can use in
02:09 - redis and as I already told you that
02:11 - redis is a key value storage so the key
02:16 - is a printable ask key right and it can
02:21 - be up to 512 megabyte so it can take a
02:26 - really big uh key for example and it
02:30 - should be a printable ask key and then
02:32 - we can see the data types of values so
02:36 - the values Can Be Strings and then uh
02:40 - the containers of strings so they can be
02:43 - uh hashes or lists or sets or sorted
02:47 - sets right so the key are printable ask
02:51 - Keys we can uh use printable ask keys
02:54 - for keys and for values we can use
02:56 - strings hashes lists sets and sorted
03:01 - sets right and this uh reddish string
03:05 - can be up to
03:07 - 5002 megabyte okay now let's start with
03:12 - the Practical example so we will start
03:16 - with the basics and we will uh try to
03:19 - set some values and get some values so
03:23 - for example I have set some values
03:26 - already to this uh redish uh server so
03:31 - what I will do is to get all the keys
03:34 - which are set you just need to write
03:37 - keys and then the pattern which uh is
03:41 - estx here so estx is a wild card and
03:44 - it's going to uh search all the keys
03:48 - which are saved in your database and
03:51 - then give you the result so for example
03:54 - I have set two keys which is name and
03:58 - name two and and uh it has given me both
04:02 - the keys which I have saved right so in
04:05 - order to see all the keys which are
04:07 - saved in your redis database you just
04:11 - need to write keys and estrick right now
04:16 - as I already uh told you that to set
04:19 - some uh value as a string you just need
04:22 - to use set and then a key for example in
04:26 - this case I'm going to write name three
04:30 - because name and name one is already set
04:33 - so I'm going to just set the third key
04:36 - which is name three and then I'm going
04:39 - to give some name right and then press
04:42 - enter and then once again I will just
04:45 - write Keys Asis and now I can see there
04:49 - are three keys stored in my database
04:53 - right so set is to set a string value
04:58 - and as you have already guessed from my
05:01 - previous videos I've shown you this
05:03 - command which is get command and
05:06 - whatever key uh you will write here
05:08 - it'll give you the value of that key
05:11 - which is Mark in this case right in the
05:15 - same way you can do name uh two get name
05:18 - two and it's going to give you the value
05:20 - of name two okay so get and set we are
05:23 - already clear now there is a delete
05:26 - command Dell okay so you using a dell
05:31 - and the key name we can delete some key
05:34 - value pair so for example I want to
05:36 - delete name two for now and then I will
05:40 - just press enter it's going to give me
05:44 - the number of uh Keys affected and in
05:48 - this case there is only one key with the
05:51 - name to and now when I just do this
05:55 - command which is Keys srix now it just
05:59 - gives me two values which is name and
06:03 - name three and because name two key is
06:06 - already deleted so I will not see this
06:10 - uh name to again right in the same way
06:13 - for example I want to delete uh name
06:16 - three key then also I can do dell and
06:21 - then name three and then press enter and
06:25 - I can see the result one key affected
06:28 - and then
06:30 - now only one key left which is name okay
06:34 - so uh this is how you can delete some
06:37 - value right now let's set uh these names
06:40 - once again so for example name Tom and
06:43 - once again do the get for example get
06:45 - name now you will uh see that the key
06:50 - value of name is overwritten with the
06:55 - name Tom so previously the value of name
06:59 - was Mark you can see here and now it's
07:03 - Tom so whenever you set uh the value of
07:09 - previously uh set key then whatever
07:12 - value you will give for this key will be
07:16 - overwritten right so value will be
07:18 - overwritten for that key now for example
07:21 - if you want to delete all the values
07:23 - which are stored in our redest database
07:25 - then we can use flush all command so for
07:28 - example I will set some more values uh
07:32 - to see this example for example name two
07:35 - is equal to John and then I'm going to
07:39 - give name 3 is equal to Max so now we
07:43 - have three names so we can uh just give
07:46 - keys and asteris to see that so we have
07:50 - three keys stored right now for example
07:53 - I want to delete all these Keys then I
07:56 - can give flush all so just write flush
08:00 - all command and then it's going to
08:03 - delete all the values so it says okay
08:05 - and then once again when we give keys
08:08 - estx then you can see empty list or set
08:13 - so all the values are deleted using
08:15 - flush all commands so these are some of
08:19 - the most frequently used uh commands
08:22 - which we can use with the strings in the
08:25 - next video also we will see some of the
08:28 - more commands which we can use with the
08:31 - string values so stay tuned and please
08:34 - write comment and subscribe and bye for
08:36 - now
