00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - node.js tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will see how we can download
00:07 - and install node.js on our Windows
00:10 - operating system so let's get started
00:13 - first of all open your favorite browser
00:15 - and search for node.js download and the
00:21 - first link which will appear here will
00:23 - be node.js dot o-r-g which is the
00:26 - official link so you can just click this
00:29 - link here ok and in here you will be
00:33 - able to see different kind of
00:36 - installations but on the node.js home
00:39 - base when you click this icon here you
00:43 - will see the two versions for Windows
00:46 - one is the LTS version which is long
00:52 - term service version right and one is
00:56 - the current version so we are interested
00:59 - in current version so I'm going to
01:01 - install this one but if you want to
01:04 - install this long-term version which
01:06 - will be available for a long time then
01:09 - you can just install this one so I'm
01:12 - going to click this option and the file
01:16 - will be downloaded which is about 12
01:19 - megabytes so I'm going to save it and
01:22 - let's save it somewhere ok so once this
01:26 - file is saved we are going to just
01:28 - install it so just click your MSI file
01:32 - so the extension of this file will be at
01:35 - dot MSI so just click this and then
01:38 - start installing the node.js right now
01:43 - nodes js installation on windows is
01:46 - really easy and you know you cannot get
01:50 - an easy installation than this
01:53 - installation so first of all this kind
01:56 - of wizard will start you just need to
01:59 - click Next here and accept terms license
02:03 - and conditions and then click Next this
02:06 - is the location where node.js will be
02:08 - installed so if you don't have any good
02:11 - reason to change it just
02:12 - it as default and then click Next now in
02:16 - here these are the things that will be
02:19 - installed in with the node G s so the
02:24 - node.js runtime NPM package manager
02:27 - which is really important for developing
02:31 - node.js applications online
02:33 - documentation and the path so this
02:38 - node.js path will be is tall or
02:40 - configured on your Windows operating
02:42 - system so you can you know start node.js
02:46 - using your command line okay so just
02:49 - click Next here
02:50 - and once you click Next you just need to
02:55 - click this install button to start the
02:57 - installation now the installation may
03:00 - take few seconds to few minutes
03:03 - depending upon the configuration of your
03:05 - Windows operating system so just wait
03:08 - for this process to complete and once
03:10 - the installation will complete we will
03:13 - go to the next step ok so now the
03:17 - installation of node.js is successfully
03:20 - completed on my Windows operating system
03:23 - and I just need to click this finish
03:26 - button now to know whether node.js is
03:30 - successfully installed on your system or
03:32 - not you need to open your command prompt
03:34 - so just search for command prompt and
03:37 - open your command prompt and in here you
03:40 - just need to type node - V which is
03:44 - going to give you the version of node.js
03:47 - installed right so just press enter and
03:51 - it will give you the version of node.js
03:53 - which you have installed so it's giving
03:55 - v6 point 5.0 this is the same version
03:58 - you can see here when we have downloaded
04:01 - it from the node.js website v6 point 5.0
04:05 - right so we know that node.js is
04:08 - successfully installed on our system now
04:10 - we have also installed NPM which is node
04:14 - package manager which with this node.js
04:17 - installer and node package manager is
04:22 - really important in developing
04:24 - you know no the applications and I will
04:27 - you know
04:28 - illustrate what NPM is and how it works
04:32 - in details in the later videos but in
04:35 - this video we will just check whether
04:37 - it's successfully installed or not so
04:40 - just write NPM for node package manager
04:44 - - v4 knowing the version of it right so
04:48 - NPM - V and hopefully it will also give
04:52 - you the version of NPM install okay so
04:56 - now we know that node is installed
04:59 - successfully on our system and NPM is
05:02 - also installed on our system so now we
05:04 - can start building our you know for
05:08 - example hello world application so just
05:11 - to check you just need to write node in
05:14 - order to start working with nodes so
05:16 - just write node and press Enter which
05:19 - will give you this kind of command line
05:21 - interface and in here you can just write
05:24 - for example console dot log and in the
05:31 - brackets so in the brackets you just
05:35 - need to write for example
05:37 - hello node so just write hello node okay
05:43 - and now you can press ENTER and it's
05:46 - going to print out hello node and then
05:49 - this undefined message and then you know
05:54 - that node is perfectly working on your
05:56 - system now let's check this node in a
06:01 - little bit better way so what we want to
06:05 - do now is I'm going to just close this
06:07 - command prompt and I will once again go
06:10 - to the node.js website and now this time
06:13 - I am going to go here which says about
06:16 - tab so just click about tab here and in
06:19 - here you will see the basic barebone
06:23 - code to you know get started with node
06:26 - which is this code okay so what I'm
06:30 - going to do here is I'm going to go to
06:33 - folder just go and create any folder in
06:37 - which you want to you know create your
06:39 - node.js project for example and then
06:43 - here I'm going to create our JavaScript
06:46 - file so I'm going to let's create our
06:50 - JavaScript file and I'm going to name it
06:52 - as app dot J's for example so just write
06:56 - app dot J s and press Enter
07:00 - we are going to you know see how we can
07:04 - build our node.js application using some
07:08 - editor better than for example normal
07:12 - editor on Windows or Linux so this we
07:16 - will see in the later videos but for now
07:18 - let's use for example I have notepad
07:21 - plus plus for JavaScript so I will open
07:24 - this app dot GS file in notepad plus
07:29 - plus but you can use any editor of your
07:32 - choice for now right and then I'm going
07:35 - to once again go to this page and I will
07:38 - just copy all the code from here just
07:40 - copy all the code and then I'm going to
07:43 - paste it here okay
07:44 - and then just save this code ok so just
07:48 - copy and paste this code and save this
07:50 - code and then I'm going to minimize
07:52 - everything once again so my code is
07:55 - saved and now I want to open the command
08:01 - prompt in this folder and the easiest
08:04 - way to do is you can do CD - you know
08:08 - this path and it will be ok but the
08:12 - easiest way is to just press your shift
08:15 - button so just press shift button and
08:18 - then right-click on this folder and then
08:22 - you will see this option which says open
08:26 - command window here so just click this
08:29 - option and you can see we are directly
08:32 - in this directory in the command line so
08:36 - we are in the samples directory which is
08:39 - here itself right now in here what we
08:43 - can do is we just need to give this
08:47 - command so just give node command and
08:50 - then the file names of
08:51 - my name is app dot J's in our case so
08:55 - this file we have created right now
08:56 - right so just write app dot J's here and
09:00 - press Enter
09:02 - okay now if you will notice here it's
09:06 - giving this message that we can open
09:11 - 127.0.0.1 which is the local host on our
09:16 - pc : this port so on port 3000 of the
09:23 - local host we can see this server
09:26 - running so I'm going to open my browser
09:29 - once again and in here I will just give
09:32 - the same address which was printed here
09:34 - so 127.0.0.1 and then port 3000 right
09:42 - which is the same address which is
09:44 - printed here this address okay and then
09:47 - press enter and you can see hello world
09:52 - is printed here so you know that your
09:55 - node.js server is working perfectly fine
09:59 - on your windows operating system and you
10:02 - know that you have you know install
10:05 - node.js perfectly on your Windows
10:07 - operating system so in this way you can
10:09 - download and install node.js on your
10:12 - Windows operating system I hope you've
