00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how you can
00:04 - connect
00:05 - your PHP script to the mySQL database
00:09 - using PHP my admin right so we were
00:13 - having this database called student and
00:16 - we were able to connect to this database
00:18 - in the last video now in this video I'm
00:20 - going to show you how you can get the
00:24 - data so we had uh this student database
00:28 - and we created a us info if you remember
00:32 - and it has some data right and I want to
00:35 - show all this data uh on the browser or
00:39 - using PHP right so how can I show this
00:43 - in this video I'm going to show you so
00:47 - let's get started this is the connect.
00:49 - PHP which I have created uh in the last
00:53 - video and I'm going to use this uh
00:55 - connect. PHP to connect to the database
00:59 - and then
01:00 - I will create a new file and I will save
01:04 - it
01:06 - as get
01:10 - data.php
01:12 - and I will save
01:14 - it and in here I will just include my
01:20 - PHP
01:25 - tags and now first of all I need to
01:29 - connect to the database in this file
01:31 - right so what I'm going to do is in this
01:34 - file I have written the code to connect
01:38 - to the database which is connect. PHP so
01:40 - I will just require this file so I will
01:43 - use this keyword
01:46 - called require and the name of my
01:51 - connect file which
01:53 - [Music]
01:56 - is
01:57 - connect. PHP
02:00 - right so this is this file which I have
02:03 - written in the last video okay once I
02:08 - have this
02:09 - file then what I'm going to do is I will
02:13 - write a query to get the data from the
02:16 - database so I will declare a variable
02:19 - called query is equal to and inside this
02:24 - I am going to write a query as a string
02:30 - now if you know a little bit
02:33 - of my SQL you already know what a query
02:37 - is query is a small little string which
02:41 - you can send to your database to query
02:46 - the data from the database right for
02:48 - example I have this uh table called user
02:52 - info and I want the data from the table
02:56 - for example this data which I have saved
02:58 - earlier in the database base and I want
03:01 - to query this data from the database
03:03 - base so what can I do is if you don't
03:07 - know about SQL queries uh I'll show you
03:10 - a simple way so just select your table
03:14 - in which you have saved your
03:16 - data and go to the structure
03:21 - here we will go to this SQL tab here
03:25 - okay so this is the tab you need to go
03:29 - once you selected your table right and
03:32 - you will see a query here which is a
03:35 - simple query to get the data from the
03:37 - database this is Select star or estx
03:40 - from your table name this is a simple
03:43 - query
03:45 - so I'm going to use the same simple
03:48 - query to get the data from the database
03:50 - in this video okay so I will just copy
03:52 - this I will leave this where clause for
03:57 - now I will just use this this query okay
04:01 - so just copy this query select estx from
04:05 - your table name table name is user info
04:07 - so this is user info and I will just
04:10 - copy it here okay so this will be my
04:14 - query simple
04:15 - query and then what I'm going to do is
04:19 - I'm going to create a while loop while
04:23 - because I want to read the data once uh
04:25 - I um execute this query right so so what
04:31 - I'm going to do is first of all let's
04:33 - execute the query first so I'm going to
04:36 - give if condition and I want to check
04:39 - whether if this query is executed or not
04:43 - right so what I'm going to do
04:46 - is I'm going
04:49 - to um make a variable
04:52 - called
04:55 - um is
05:02 - very run for example you can give any
05:06 - variable name is equal to and now I'm
05:10 - going to use a function in my SQL so
05:15 - which fetches the data or which executes
05:17 - the query so just write
05:20 - MySQL
05:23 - underscore query okay this is the
05:26 - function in PHP which you from which you
05:29 - can execute your query and what it does
05:32 - it returns Boolean value so if the query
05:36 - is executed it will return true and we
05:38 - will go to the condition or statement
05:40 - inside if condition otherwise if it's um
05:44 - not executed it will return false and we
05:47 - will be able to catch the else condition
05:51 - right now I'm going to pass my query
05:54 - which is this one to
05:57 - my MySQL Query function function
06:00 - right now once this query is executed I
06:04 - can echo
06:08 - echo for
06:11 - now
06:15 - query executive for example okay else I
06:20 - can just
06:23 - show
06:25 - else I can just say qu not executed
06:32 - right so let's see if we are able to
06:35 - execute our query or not and then we
06:37 - will get the data from the database and
06:39 - show it okay I save it and I will go to
06:45 - Local Host and to my
06:48 - folder and then database and in here
06:52 - this was the file I have made right get
06:56 - data and it says connection successful P
07:00 - or connection success which comes from
07:03 - this file connect file which says
07:05 - connection success for now I'm going to
07:08 - comment this out so I don't need to see
07:11 - this uh connection success and I will
07:14 - save it and I will refresh it and now it
07:18 - says query executed so now I know that
07:21 - my query is successfully executed this
07:24 - query right now once the query is Su
07:28 - successfully executed what I want is I
07:31 - want to get the data okay so that this I
07:36 - can use by
07:37 - using while
07:40 - loop
07:42 - while and why I'm using the while loop I
07:46 - will show you
07:48 - because I want to fetch the data from
07:52 - the database and it will be an
07:56 - associative array Okay so what function
08:00 - we can use to get the data let's see so
08:04 - I I will declare a variable called
08:10 - very uh UND underscore
08:15 - excute is equal to this is a variable
08:17 - name right and we will use my
08:21 - SQL
08:23 - underscore
08:25 - fetch ass source as o C which means
08:31 - associative array right and in
08:36 - this function MySQL fetch as o we will
08:42 - pass
08:44 - our
08:45 - qu run okay this one this
08:51 - variable so just copy this and pass it
08:55 - here and once we have our we will
09:00 - execute this function it will return the
09:03 - data in the form of associative array in
09:06 - this variable okay so what we can do is
09:10 - we can just cut this from here
09:13 - and just paste it
09:16 - inside as a argument of our y Loop so we
09:19 - have our associative array here right in
09:23 - this
09:24 - variable okay so now what I can do is I
09:28 - can get get uh this or I can call this
09:32 - uh associative array variable to get the
09:37 - data so for example I want to get all
09:41 - the
09:42 - names from this user inut table so I
09:46 - have this user input table in my
09:49 - database and I have the column like ID
09:52 - name surname age username and password
09:55 - so I want to show all the names from
09:57 - this database right now only two names
09:59 - are there mark and John in my browser
10:04 - right so what I can do is I can simply
10:08 - Echo and just use this associative array
10:12 - and if you followed my last video you
10:14 - know that we can use the key of the
10:19 - associative array to get data so key
10:22 - here is the column name so I want to get
10:26 - the value of name column here right this
10:29 - is my table and there is a column called
10:31 - name and I want to get the values okay
10:35 - so the key will be
10:39 - the column name so I will write here
10:43 - name okay and I will just save it and
10:48 - once again I will go to my browser and
10:50 - refresh it and now you can see two names
10:55 - let
10:56 - me do a little bit better I will just
11:00 - concatenate this in
11:03 - break okay I'll will just give a Break
11:06 - Tag so that you can
11:10 - see okay and let me give break here also
11:18 - after query executed
11:22 - okay in here save it once again refresh
11:26 - it and now you can see your names here
11:30 - right which are there from uh in the
11:32 - database okay so we have name Mark and
11:37 - John in the database and we are seeing
11:40 - those names from the database in this
11:43 - web browser let's add a new data in the
11:46 - database so what I'm going to do I'm
11:50 - going to go to the
11:52 - structure not to the structure but
11:55 - insert tag here so I will go to the
11:58 - insert tag and I
12:01 - will I will add some more data so for
12:06 - example new
12:08 - name and
12:14 - surname and
12:18 - age and
12:21 - username and
12:25 - password okay and I will click go and
12:29 - data is saved I can browse I can go to
12:32 - this browse tab I can see there is a new
12:35 - data here right now I can refresh
12:38 - it and you will be able to see the third
12:41 - name here which is added here right so
12:44 - you know that whatever is in the
12:47 - database you are getting it here now
12:50 - let's uh take a little
12:54 - table so if you know HTML you know how
12:58 - to uh make a table right or otherwise if
13:01 - you don't know how to make a table using
13:03 - HTML just browse internet and you will
13:07 - be able to find
13:09 - many good uh tutorial there okay so what
13:14 - I'm going to do is I'm going to
13:17 - take Echo and I'm going to take table
13:22 - tags to create a table like structure
13:24 - for me right so what I'm going to do I'm
13:28 - going to take
13:29 - uh for example first of
13:33 - all uh tag called
13:36 - TR TR is the table row tag right if you
13:42 - remember and I will end this TR like
13:46 - this and inside this table row I'm going
13:50 - to insert
13:52 - some table data so just give
13:57 - two Brack
13:59 - like this and TD and I will just close
14:03 - this TD here TD right and in a similar
14:08 - way I'm going to just take two
14:13 - more or whatever number of columns you
14:17 - have and in here I can just insert this
14:22 - data okay so what I'm going to do I will
14:26 - copy this and I will just
14:29 - concatenate using
14:32 - concatenation I'll just insert it here
14:35 - right this will give us the
14:39 - name and then in the same way we can
14:44 - concatenate here the surname for example
14:48 - so
14:49 - just take the surname which is the
14:51 - second column name here called surname
14:56 - right so just write surname
15:02 - so for now I'm showing this these two
15:05 - rows you can take all the rows like this
15:08 - using this
15:09 - example and now I will just remove all
15:13 - the other TD for
15:22 - now so
15:24 - my table structure looks like this I
15:27 - will just commment this and let's see I
15:29 - can get the names and the surname inside
15:33 - the table or not save it and let's
15:36 - refresh
15:38 - it uh showing some error let's see
15:41 - what's the error probably some
15:43 - concatenation
15:49 - error oh I forgot the table tag without
15:53 - table tag we cannot use TR and TD right
15:57 - I'll will give
15:59 - table start here and at the end of this
16:02 - row I will give table
16:09 - end okay so I have this tags and I will
16:12 - just save
16:13 - it and now let's try and run the
16:18 - program and we see this here uh the name
16:22 - and surname right according to this
16:24 - table name is Mark and surname is this
16:27 - John and surname Julie and surname so
16:31 - you can see here but still you don't see
16:34 - some padding so we require this some
16:36 - padding in the table so just
16:40 - give border for example is equal
16:44 - to
16:46 - one
16:49 - and let's give width
16:53 - here
16:55 - withd or style for example
17:00 - style is equal
17:02 - to in the brackets
17:07 - give
17:10 - with colon
17:14 - 300px
17:16 - okay so let's save it run
17:20 - it and now you can see the table and the
17:24 - name and surname so you can play with
17:27 - the HTML tags
17:29 - what I wanted to say is you can play
17:31 - with HTML tags to create a table like
17:35 - this right so in this video you can get
17:40 - any data which is present in your
17:43 - database in your PHP script and show it
17:47 - like this
17:49 - right now um that's it I think for this
17:54 - video in the next or in the couple of
17:57 - next video I'm going to show you how to
18:00 - use this MySQL with PHP more
18:03 - interactively so stay tuned and please
18:06 - wait coming and subscribe and bye for
18:07 - now
