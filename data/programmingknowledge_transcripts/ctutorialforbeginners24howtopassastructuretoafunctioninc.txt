00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how you can
00:04 - use structures in
00:07 - C++ and I have shown you this example
00:10 - that how you can define a structure for
00:13 - a book and how you can use or call the
00:16 - structure inside your main program and
00:20 - how you can assign values to your
00:23 - structures member right now in this
00:27 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:30 - use structure as an argument to the
00:33 - function so in normal program we are
00:38 - able
00:38 - to pass some arguments like inss or
00:43 - characters or double or float values and
00:46 - I have already told you in the last
00:50 - video
00:51 - that structure is a user defined data
00:55 - type like int like car these car are in
01:00 - and care and int are the C++ uh data
01:05 - type and this book for example which you
01:08 - have defined in the last video is a user
01:12 - defined data type which we have created
01:15 - now in order to use this structure book
01:20 - inside a function as an argument you
01:23 - need to pass it like a structure so
01:27 - let's see how we can use this this
01:30 - structure as an argument inside a
01:32 - function now in order if if you don't
01:35 - know what this code is just see the last
01:38 - video I'm using the code from the last
01:40 - video in this video also okay and in
01:43 - this in the last video we had defined
01:45 - the structure and I have shown you how
01:47 - you can use it now for example we want
01:51 - to define a
01:53 - function to print the content of the
01:56 - book okay so I will Define a function
02:00 - called
02:03 - void
02:05 - print
02:06 - book and I will just give this and I
02:10 - will give
02:11 - this not this but this parenthesis here
02:17 - now in order to pass your book structure
02:21 - in the function as an argument what you
02:25 - need to do is once again you need to go
02:28 - here in the parenthesis and you need to
02:30 - call the this keyword
02:33 - called struct and then you need to call
02:38 - the data type or the structure name
02:41 - which is book in our case right and then
02:45 - just give any name to your book
02:49 - structure so I will name it as book
02:52 - itself and then what this book is doing
02:55 - is it this book I'm I will use to to
03:01 - print the name of name contained
03:05 - by this book variable so I will just
03:09 - copy it and paste it
03:12 - here as you remember how we can uh we
03:16 - can call the content of the
03:18 - book by its members so book this is the
03:23 - variable name dot what is the member
03:26 - name of this book structure book name
03:29 - author and ID okay so I will just use
03:33 - this book in order to print the book
03:36 - name book author and book ID
03:41 - now this is just simply you need to pass
03:45 - in order to call this book
03:49 - variable inside this per this inside
03:53 - this function as a parameter or argument
03:57 - right now in order to call this print
04:02 - function what you need to do is just
04:04 - copy this function name paste it here
04:08 - and as a normal variable uh how you pass
04:13 - your normal
04:14 - variable variable inside this function
04:18 - like this right so think of it if it's a
04:22 - integer variable and this will be a
04:26 - integer
04:27 - variable simply you will pass any number
04:31 - here okay or the variable which contains
04:35 - the number in a similar way we will pass
04:38 - this variable of book because we have
04:40 - defined this book data type here for
04:44 - this book right so this is this book we
04:47 - can pass it inside the function and now
04:51 - when we compile the
04:54 - program and run the program it will work
04:57 - fine right it's printing whatever we
05:01 - have assigned here so we have assigned
05:05 - book name C++ book author programming
05:08 - knowledge book id1 and then we are
05:11 - calling this function to print the value
05:13 - book one name book one name is book one
05:17 - book. name right so we have passed this
05:21 - and book. name is C++ tutorial which is
05:25 - which comes from here right so in this
05:28 - way you can
05:30 - pass structure variable as a parameter
05:34 - to a function I hope you understood the
05:37 - concept behind this and I hope you have
05:41 - enjoyed the video please wait comment
05:42 - and subscribe and bye for now
