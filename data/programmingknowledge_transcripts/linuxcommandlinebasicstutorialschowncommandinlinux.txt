00:00 - this particular video we are going to
00:01 - cover about the ch own command that
00:03 - basically means change ownership command
00:05 - okay
00:06 - so before starting uh let me tell you
00:08 - the brief or a little bit of
00:10 - introduction about this command
00:12 - basically it means what as the name
00:14 - suggests that change ownership what does
00:16 - it basically means uh let's take a
00:18 - scenario of a corporate world okay in
00:21 - which you are working in a team
00:23 - and there are people with different
00:24 - roles okay and if you have access of
00:26 - some kind of file and
00:28 - you want to share that file to some
00:30 - another team okay so in this case you
00:33 - can use the ch own command okay like
00:36 - there will be a one particular group for
00:38 - one team
00:39 - and you want to give that access to some
00:42 - other team member or some other
00:46 - group member you can say okay
00:48 - so it basically means changing the
00:50 - ownership of a file or transferring the
00:52 - ownership
00:53 - to some other people or to some other
00:56 - user
00:57 - okay so we will start this uh
00:59 - okay so but before starting uh
01:02 - i will tell you to just set up your root
01:04 - account okay but because we will use
01:07 - root account and also one another user
01:09 - to perform this
01:10 - uh particular ch one command okay so to
01:14 - set up a root command first of all what
01:15 - you have to you have to just change the
01:17 - password if you don't know so enter the
01:19 - password command and the username that
01:21 - is a root
01:23 - and you have to just use a sudo and
01:29 - and now you can enter the new password
01:31 - which you want
01:33 - okay password related successfully
01:36 - and one more thing what we have to do i
01:38 - will add another user
01:40 - add user
01:42 - and i will give the name as a
01:49 - avinash
01:51 - okay
01:52 - so enter a password
01:58 - i will not provide any kind of
02:00 - information okay yes okay so user has
02:02 - been created
02:04 - now what you will do first login as a
02:06 - root in this terminal
02:11 - wrong password i enter wrong password
02:16 - yeah now i'm logged in as a root user
02:19 - here you can see root
02:20 - and now again i will open up an another
02:22 - terminal in which i will log in with the
02:24 - credential of avinash
02:28 - uh i hope it is visible to you now
02:31 - yeah it should be visible to you guys
02:33 - so now what we have to do uh we have to
02:35 - just login as a different user that is a
02:38 - uh avinash
02:40 - okay just enter the password of that
02:42 - particular user uh test uh
02:46 - avenue okay so here we you can see
02:48 - i have another user in this terminal and
02:51 - another user in this terminal
02:53 - okay so this is the root user and this
02:55 - is the avinash user okay
03:02 - so now both the user are in the home
03:04 - directory let me
03:05 - do here also same thing
03:07 - okay so both the users are in the home
03:09 - directory okay so now what i have to do
03:12 - to see the permissions or to see
03:15 - anything
03:16 - uh permission of a file or directory or
03:19 - anything else which you want what what
03:20 - command you enter just you enter ls
03:24 - hyphen l yl
03:26 - just a long listing of files you can say
03:28 - like that
03:29 - okay so here you can see we have three
03:31 - directories and these are the some
03:34 - permissions based on those directory
03:36 - that is read write execute read
03:38 - and then for others there is no any
03:41 - permissions okay but these are regarding
03:44 - what you can say these are regarding
03:46 - your
03:47 - uh
03:47 - users like this is the user's directory
03:50 - but we don't have to work on this i will
03:53 - work on some different directories or
03:55 - different files okay
03:56 - so what i will do i will just create a
03:58 - one file that is touch file.txt
04:01 - and i will do ls hyphen l and that
04:03 - particular file name so here you can see
04:05 - in this case
04:06 - uh if you have watched our previous
04:09 - videos on permissions okay so i think
04:11 - you will get it easily so these three
04:13 - represents the
04:15 - permissions of users
04:17 - and this is for groups and these are
04:20 - from other user so here you can see
04:23 - uh groups has only read permission and
04:25 - other others also has only read
04:27 - permissions okay
04:29 - but uh
04:31 - this particular user has a read and
04:33 - write permission okay so with the owner
04:35 - right now the owner right now is
04:39 - root
04:40 - root is the owner right now
04:42 - okay so now what uh you have to serve
04:45 - suppose or you have to think like that
04:47 - you have to share this file.txt to
04:49 - someone else to avinash
04:52 - okay this user you have to share now
04:55 - what will happen list to ls and i will
04:57 - try to access this file so i hope i can
05:00 - access because others have read
05:02 - permissions
05:03 - so let me hit enter this command so here
05:06 - you can see we have not got any error
05:08 - like permission denied so now what i
05:10 - will do i will just add one line in this
05:14 - particular file hi this is
05:17 - root user
05:19 - ctrl d to save
05:22 - okay and now again i will try to access
05:25 - and here you can see i am able to access
05:27 - this file but if i will go to change the
05:30 - permission in this particular file then
05:32 - at that time what will happen if we will
05:34 - get an error of permission denied why
05:37 - why we will get error the reason behind
05:39 - is this that we don't have execute
05:42 - permissions
05:43 - okay so now what we have to do
05:46 - if i will try to add some extra lines in
05:49 - this
05:50 - file.txt so how we can do file.txt let's
05:54 - see if we are able to add or not
05:57 - so here you can see permission denied so
05:59 - okay as i said earlier like if we don't
06:01 - have permission like execute permission
06:03 - so
06:04 - to change the
06:07 - to change
06:08 - in the file okay
06:09 - so to do this uh we have two options one
06:13 - is change ownership just for one
06:15 - particular user or simply add execute
06:17 - permission for others using uh ch
06:21 - command okay uh
06:22 - change permission like chmod command
06:25 - okay you can use uh that command to
06:28 - change the permission for all the users
06:31 - but that is not a useful case or that is
06:34 - not a best scenario because you don't
06:36 - want to share that file to all the users
06:39 - okay so that's why ch own command came
06:42 - into this role and that's why we are
06:44 - using it
06:45 - so how you can do it
06:48 - just use ch own and whatever the
06:50 - username you want to uh
06:52 - here our username is uh this particular
06:55 - username is i uh avinash
06:58 - show avinash and i will just provide the
07:00 - file name
07:02 - and
07:03 - done
07:04 - now i'll do ls iphone and here you can
07:06 - see avinash is now the
07:08 - uh new owner of that particular file so
07:11 - let's iphone and let me do two
07:13 - one more time yeah here you can see
07:15 - obviously it's a new new owner
07:18 - sorry and now
07:23 - if i will try to change in this
07:24 - particular file then
07:25 - obviously i will be able to change
07:28 - here i will add just
07:32 - this line has been added by
07:37 - avinash ctrl d to save and again i will
07:40 - try to access
07:41 - and here you can see
07:43 - this line has been added by
07:46 - which user
07:47 - avinash
07:49 - okay we can also uh use multiple options
07:52 - with ch one command like ch own hyphen c
07:55 - for
07:57 - what you can say for in informations
08:00 - okay
08:01 - like it will display just like uh
08:03 - information like
08:04 - a permission has been transformed from
08:06 - this user to this user let's do this uh
08:08 - with this again let's hope it works or
08:11 - not let's see uh ch on hyphen c and i
08:14 - will provide the username that is
08:16 - avinash
08:18 - and file
08:21 - okay it's not showing me
08:25 - where do we
08:26 - okay ownership file dot t is to retained
08:29 - as avinash okay and you can see we have
08:32 - used iphone v for wordpress and it just
08:34 - displays the extra information
08:43 - um
08:45 - yeah it's still avinash okay so
08:48 - no worries so in this way ch own command
08:51 - works okay so i hope you like this video
08:54 - and i hope you got the concept of how ch
08:56 - own works okay so that's all for today's
