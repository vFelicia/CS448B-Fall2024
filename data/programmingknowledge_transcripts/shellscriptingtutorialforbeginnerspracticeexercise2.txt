00:00 - hello guys now in this video we will be
00:02 - talking about our task two okay so let
00:04 - me discuss with you what we'll be doing
00:06 - in our this task so basically we will be
00:08 - connecting our remote machine with the
00:11 - SSH using bash script okay we will
00:13 - create a script with the help of this we
00:15 - will connect to that particular machine
00:16 - so we uh first of all let me tell you
00:19 - how you can create your virtual machine
00:20 - so actually I have there is a link for
00:24 - you I will add this link in our uh
00:26 - description then there is a tutorial to
00:28 - create a virtual machine you can easily
00:29 - do it okay and I have actually already
00:32 - created the machine so here is my public
00:35 - IP address I will copy this IP address
00:37 - and now I will create the script okay
00:40 - so let me open the vs code and I will
00:43 - just create the file 0 7 task two dot sh
00:48 - okay but before that I will tell you
00:50 - like
00:51 - if you want to do it on yourself you can
00:54 - easily do it okay
00:56 - so if you do it yourself and that will
00:58 - be very good for you so because you will
01:00 - get a more confidence as well you will
01:02 - learn more quickly so let me I will just
01:04 - give you the basic idea what we will be
01:06 - doing so I will take the username and
01:09 - the password okay not username and the
01:12 - IP and then I will use the SSH command
01:14 - to connect with that machine so this is
01:16 - the overall idea and if you want to take
01:18 - input from the parameter then also you
01:20 - can
01:22 - do it okay
01:24 - so first of all let's take the input I
01:27 - will prompt the user to enter the
01:29 - username first
01:31 - user name and then here I will create
01:34 - the username variable then I read hyphen
01:37 - P enter the
01:39 - IP
01:41 - so if I create the IP variable
01:43 - SSH command SSH dollar username we need
01:47 - to do dollar username
01:49 - dollar
01:52 - IB
01:54 - okay so this is the uh command which we
01:58 - we will use okay otherwise we can do
02:01 - with the passing parameters also you we
02:03 - will do it that also
02:05 - so now I will need to give the
02:07 - permission to this file 0 7 now we'll
02:12 - execute this file 0 7
02:14 - and I will enter the username as ayush
02:17 - and my IP is not this one
02:21 - here okay
02:24 - and my IP is this
02:27 - and it will ask me to enter the password
02:29 - so I will enter the password
02:33 - okay
02:34 - so here you can see I use I use the name
02:37 - of the vmh also if that's why it's
02:39 - showing like this I will do LS here so
02:41 - nothing is there who am I so name of the
02:44 - user I use here also so in this way you
02:47 - can connect with the uh remote machine
02:50 - using our bash script okay so you can do
02:53 - exit to exit come out of the machine and
02:57 - now we will see how we can uh connect
02:59 - with the uh using like parameters okay
03:03 - so what I will do I will just comment
03:05 - out these all and I will create a
03:08 - valuable username and it will be equal
03:12 - to the dollar one okay the first
03:14 - parameter then the IP will be equal to
03:17 - the dollar two okay we will save this
03:20 - script and I will just pass the
03:24 - parameters like I wish for username and
03:26 - IP for
03:28 - this okay two four seven
03:31 - hit enter
03:33 - and it will ask me to enter the password
03:38 - now we are good to go and again let's
03:42 - check who am I I wish okay so in this
03:45 - way you can connect with the remote
03:47 - machine easily you can use environment
03:49 - variables not environment variable you
03:51 - can pass parameters you can use
03:54 - variables okay whatever thing you want
03:56 - to do so I hope you liked it so this is
03:59 - a way to learn new things by while doing
04:01 - some new things like create I will like
04:05 - in future
04:06 - uh I will come up with more task okay
04:09 - so that's all for today's guys and I
04:11 - hope you have used all the concept which
04:13 - you have learned till now so that's all
04:15 - and I meet you in the next video thank
04:17 - you for watching
