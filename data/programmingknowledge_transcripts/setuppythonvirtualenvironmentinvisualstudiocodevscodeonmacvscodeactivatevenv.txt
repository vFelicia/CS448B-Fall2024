00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install numpy with your
00:05 - Visual Studio code on your Mac operating
00:07 - system in addition I'm also going to
00:10 - show you how you can create a virtual en
00:13 - environment for python for your scripts
00:18 - and this video also covers if you want
00:20 - to use any other pip package on your
00:25 - Visual Studio code how you can install
00:27 - those kind of libraries so let's let's
00:30 - get started so first of all I have this
00:32 - folder opened in Visual Studio code
00:35 - which is right now empty here I want to
00:37 - create a numpy script so I'm going to
00:41 - click on uh this new file option and
00:43 - then I'm going to just uh create a new
00:47 - uh python file I'm going to name it as
00:50 - test.py and once this file is created
00:53 - I'm going to paste a very simple numpy
00:57 - uh script here so the code does doesn't
01:00 - matter here the thing which matters here
01:03 - is you can see import numpy could not be
01:07 - resolved so this error it's showing
01:10 - because we haven't yet installed the
01:14 - numpy package so first of all to start
01:17 - with we can create a virtual EnV so that
01:22 - when we install a numi package it's only
01:26 - available inside that virtual and and it
01:28 - doesn't install that numpy package
01:32 - globally so what you can do here is you
01:34 - can open a new terminal click on
01:36 - Terminal and then open a new terminal on
01:39 - Mac OS you will see that the default uh
01:44 - terminal is Zs but you can also open
01:49 - bash or if your uh Mac operating system
01:52 - supports any other type of terminal you
01:54 - will be able to see the option here we
01:56 - are going to use the zsh terminal in in
02:00 - this video now first of all to create a
02:04 - virtual en just type python on your
02:07 - terminal and then press on the tab key
02:11 - and it's going to autocomplete whatever
02:13 - version of python you have in my case
02:16 - python is recognized by Python 3 if you
02:20 - have any other version of python when
02:22 - you press tab then you will be able to
02:25 - see all the related uh commands which
02:28 - you can use uh with python in my case I
02:32 - have this Python 3 so just type Python 3
02:35 - then space hyphen M then just write VNV
02:41 - and then the name of your virtual
02:42 - environment I'm going to name it as a
02:45 - andv this name can be anything so you
02:48 - can name it as anything or any name you
02:52 - can give here I'm going to name it n
02:55 - here okay so I have given this command
02:59 - which is Python 3 space hyphen m space
03:03 - VNV space EnV and what it does is it
03:08 - creates this directory with the name n
03:13 - and then inside this directory you have
03:15 - all the virtual environment related
03:18 - files so once this n directory is
03:22 - created or whatever you name you have
03:24 - given to your environment that directory
03:26 - will be created you will also observe in
03:29 - your uh Visual Studio code that this
03:33 - environment here is changed to the new
03:37 - environment so you can switch between
03:39 - the virtual environment or any other
03:41 - python environment by clicking here at
03:44 - the bottom where you see the version of
03:46 - python so in my case I have the python
03:49 - 3.12 virtual environment I also have the
03:53 - normal python
03:55 - 3.2 and I have this python 3.9 uh
03:59 - version so I'm going to choose this
04:01 - virtual environment and now once the
04:04 - virtual environment is created we need
04:06 - to activate our virtual environment to
04:08 - activate it just write uh source and
04:12 - then whatever name uh you have given to
04:14 - your environment in my case it's EnV so
04:16 - I'm going to write EnV forward slash bin
04:22 - so you can see in this n we have this
04:25 - bin directory which is created we and we
04:27 - need to call this activate
04:30 - file right so I'm going to write en/
04:33 - bbin SL
04:35 - activate and once you uh write this
04:39 - command just press enter which is going
04:40 - to activate the virtual environment and
04:44 - how you can recognize that this
04:45 - environment is activated you will see
04:47 - this kind of EnV or your environment
04:51 - name in the parenthesis in front of your
04:53 - command line so your virtual environment
04:56 - is created now we just need need to
05:00 - install numpy package so to install
05:02 - numpy package you can give this command
05:05 - pip and then press Tab Key on your
05:09 - keyboard right so it's going to complete
05:11 - the PIP command if you have only pip
05:14 - then it's not going to show you any
05:16 - suggestion if you uh have Pip three then
05:19 - it's going to autoc complete so you can
05:20 - see I have three kind of pip available
05:24 - one is PIP other is PIP three and the
05:28 - third one is PIP
05:30 - 3.12 I'm going to use pip 3 for now but
05:34 - uh if you have any other version you can
05:37 - use that then install just write install
05:41 - and then the name of the package which
05:43 - we want to install in my case it's numpy
05:46 - so I'm going to write numpy here and
05:49 - then press enter which is going to
05:51 - install this numpy package you can see
05:54 - when I have run this command which is
05:57 - PIP 3 install numpy then it has
06:00 - installed the numpy package and once the
06:04 - numpy package is installed I can see
06:06 - this error is already gone when I hover
06:09 - over numpy package earlier I was seeing
06:12 - the error here but now this error is
06:14 - gone so now I can run my script so now
06:18 - once the numpy package is uh installed I
06:21 - can clear the
06:23 - terminal and then to run my python
06:26 - script I can simply write uh python
06:29 - three in my case and then the name of
06:32 - the file which is test.py and then press
06:34 - enter and it's going to run my script
06:37 - and show me the output you can see it
06:40 - shows me the output of my numpy script
06:43 - so this is how you can create the
06:46 - virtual environment with your Visual
06:49 - Studio code and then install any pip
06:52 - package using this kind of approach I
06:56 - have installed numpy but you can just
06:59 - write pip 3 install and any other
07:01 - package if you're using let's say bcrypt
07:04 - or py toch or any other package you can
07:07 - simply write pip 3 space install space
07:10 - that name of the package and that
07:12 - package will be installed on your Mac
07:15 - operating system using visual studio
07:17 - code so that's it for this video I hope
07:20 - you've enjoyed this video and I will see
07:21 - you in the next video
