00:01 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use Google Maps with
00:04 - your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:06 - application so let's get started I have
00:10 - this blank Visual Basic project made and
00:13 - uh I will go to the toolbox and search
00:15 - for the tool called split container and
00:18 - I will drag and drop inside my form what
00:21 - with this split container does is this
00:24 - enables us to resize our panel right
00:27 - like this that's that's why I'm using
00:30 - this plate
00:31 - container and then inside my second
00:34 - panel I'm going to go to my toolbox and
00:36 - drag and drop a web browser inside my
00:39 - second panel in here it will search for
00:42 - the Google Maps and show the options
00:46 - right and in here in the first panel I'm
00:48 - going to take four text boxes text box
00:52 - one two
00:55 - three and four and four labels
01:02 - label
01:04 - 1
01:06 - 2
01:07 - 3 and
01:10 - four
01:12 - and I will change the text of these
01:15 - labels
01:20 - as
01:28 - Street
01:35 - City
01:39 - ZIP not zip but first the state and then
01:42 - the
01:44 - zip State and
01:47 - zip so what I'm showing you is it's not
01:52 - necessary that uh you need to search on
01:56 - the basis of all four parameter you can
01:59 - either
02:00 - enter one parameter or you can either
02:03 - enter two parameter three parameter it
02:07 - depends upon the user it's not necessary
02:10 - that you have
02:11 - to enter all the four
02:15 - parameters together okay so now I will
02:19 - change
02:20 - the text box name first text box name is
02:24 - textbox
02:25 - uncore Street second textbox name is
02:29 - text box
02:32 - underscore
02:34 - City third textbox name is textbox
02:41 - uncore State and fourth textbox name is
02:44 - textbox
02:46 - uncore
02:48 - zip this should be
02:51 - underscore and I'm going to take a
02:55 - button and I will change its text as uh
02:59 - search
03:03 - search now I'm going to just double
03:06 - click this button and in here I'm going
03:07 - to write the code for searching whatever
03:12 - I enter in my text boxes and show it in
03:15 - the web browser in Google Maps but first
03:18 - of all I will import one Library
03:23 - import system do
03:28 - text and in here then I will declare
03:31 - four
03:34 - variables
03:37 - dim
03:40 - street is equal or
03:44 - as
03:49 - string is equal
03:56 - to text box for Street
04:01 - dot text right in the same way I will
04:05 - declare this for all the text boxes for
04:10 - Street city state and name so second
04:13 - is
04:17 - city
04:20 - state
04:23 - zp and this should be textbox _
04:27 - City this should be Tex box underscore
04:31 - State and four is textbox underscore zip
04:37 - now I will make a try catch block so
04:38 - just
04:40 - write try catch and inside my catch
04:44 - block I will write a message so that if
04:47 - some
04:48 - exception occurs it will show some
04:52 - message right
04:57 - so exception
05:00 - will come here
05:12 - so unable to retrieve data okay and
05:16 - inside my text Tri blog I will
05:20 - declare a new variable
05:23 - called
05:27 - dim query
05:31 - address as
05:37 - new
05:39 - string Builder and once again I will use
05:44 - this query address and I will write quy
05:46 - address.
05:49 - upend and in here I'm going to write the
05:53 - address of Google Maps
05:57 - right this is uh the address I'm going
06:00 - to write just write HTTP colon
06:03 - maps.google.com
06:05 - Maps question mark Q is equal to and
06:10 - then we will make some if conditions so
06:14 - just write
06:18 - if your text box name so the text box
06:23 - name for first text box is
06:27 - textbox dot text boore street. text is
06:32 - not equal to so just write
06:38 - this string do
06:42 - mty then what you going to do
06:46 - is just append this query address your
06:51 - street so just query address
06:55 - append and inside this just copy the
06:58 - name of your street
07:01 - and then just write this plus
07:06 - not this one
07:10 - but just write this plus and double
07:16 - quotes and this end sign plus double
07:20 - quotes and in here just write
07:23 - comma and in the second double quotes
07:26 - just WR plus so what this code will do
07:31 - is it will append this street what we
07:34 - have entered in the text box Street and
07:37 - it will add it here so this will be the
07:40 - link is equal to the street name will
07:43 - come here if there is something in your
07:46 - text box otherwise it will go to the
07:49 - next if if condition so in the same way
07:52 - I will just copy these
07:55 - four times so first was for for Street
07:59 - second is for City just write City here
08:03 - third is for
08:05 - State just write State
08:10 - here
08:13 - State and fourth condition is for zip
08:16 - and we are also going to change textbox
08:18 - name second is for textbox City third is
08:22 - for textbox uh State and fourth is for
08:26 - textbox
08:28 - Z
08:30 - and at the last once we have our query
08:34 - we just need our web browser so just
08:36 - copy the name of your web browser which
08:39 - is this
08:40 - one web browser
08:45 - one and just say
08:47 - dot
08:49 - navigate and just copy the name of your
08:53 - query address dot to
08:56 - string so that's it this is the code
08:59 - code now I will run the
09:01 - code and in here for example I want to
09:04 - search for the city called
09:08 - frankort and I will click this search
09:12 - and you'll see the map of Frankfurt City
09:17 - and for example I want to search
09:20 - for some Street in Frankfurt so I will
09:27 - write some Street and fan Fort and
09:29 - search for it and it will search for
09:32 - this street in Frankfurt so in this way
09:36 - you can search any City or Street or
09:39 - straet or zip or you can enter your
09:42 - other conditions like longitude latitude
09:45 - or other country name you can search
09:49 - using this codes so I hope you have enjo
