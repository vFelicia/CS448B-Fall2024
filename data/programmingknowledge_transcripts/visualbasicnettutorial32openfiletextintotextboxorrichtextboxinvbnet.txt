00:00 - hello guys in this video I will show you
00:02 - how to open a text file inside a rich
00:06 - text box or a textbox using your Visual
00:10 - Basic Windows Form application so let's
00:13 - get started for this example I will use
00:15 - a rich text box you can also use text
00:19 - box in place of Rich text box so just
00:22 - drag and drop Rich textbox tool inside
00:25 - your form and I will also take a button
00:31 - okay and I will anchor this Rich text
00:35 - box to the sides so go to the property
00:39 - called anchor and anchor to all the side
00:44 - except the top and I will change the
00:47 - text of this button
00:51 - as
00:53 - open text
00:56 - file okay and I'm also going to take
00:59 - take uh open file dialogue to open the
01:03 - path of the file so go to your toolbox
01:06 - and take a open file dialog from here
01:09 - and drag and drop inside your form once
01:12 - again yes and it will go below
01:16 - your uh form it will not directly go
01:19 - into the form so now just select your
01:24 - button and double click it and in here
01:27 - first of all write the code for opening
01:30 - the open file dialogue so write
01:35 - if open file dialog
01:38 - 1 dot show
01:42 - dialogue is equal
01:44 - to dialog
01:48 - result dot
01:52 - okay then so this will create a if
01:56 - condition if this is true then just
01:59 - write the name of a your Rich text box
02:01 - so I will
02:03 - write Rich textbox one which is the name
02:06 - of my rich text box dot
02:12 - text is equal
02:14 - to
02:16 - my DOT
02:20 - computer
02:22 - dot file
02:24 - system
02:27 - dot read all text
02:31 - and in the
02:32 - bracket just give the path of the file
02:36 - so how to give the path of the file just
02:39 - copy your open file dialogue
02:43 - name and then write
02:45 - dot file
02:48 - name okay and press enter so this is the
02:52 - code
02:53 - for opening the file dialogue and
02:57 - transferring this file text file content
03:01 - to the rich text box so if you want you
03:04 - can copy this code and now we are going
03:07 - to run the
03:10 - program and from this button I'm going
03:13 - to open a open file dialogue to select
03:16 - any file and then I will search for a
03:20 - file text
03:22 - file so let's see where it is yeah so I
03:26 - have a test text file so I will select
03:29 - this file and
03:30 - click open and you can see the text file
03:34 - is opened inside my rich text box so in
03:39 - this way you can open any text file
03:41 - using your Visual Basic Windows Form
03:44 - application and Rich text box so I hope
