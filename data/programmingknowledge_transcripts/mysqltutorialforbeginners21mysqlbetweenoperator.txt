00:00 - hello friends time to program
00:02 - acknowledge in this video we will see
00:05 - how to use between keyword in SQL query
00:09 - so first of all open terminal MySQL -
00:21 - you root - P ok so databases we have
00:39 - data test database here show tables we
00:54 - have student table here let us see what
01:00 - are the values present in tech table
01:10 - okay so we have roll number name in
01:15 - Sunday now I want to fetch the values on
01:22 - the basis of roll number that list of
01:27 - all the students that have roll number
01:30 - between 5 0 1 2 5 and 4 okay so how
01:40 - would we do it with the help of end
01:42 - given so we write something like this
01:47 - select select star from student
02:01 - we're roll number is greater than or
02:08 - equal to five zero two and again roll
02:22 - number we have to write roll number
02:26 - twice roll number less than or equal to
02:30 - five one four okay artists you can see
02:34 - we are getting these three decodes now
02:39 - instead of using and keyword we can use
02:44 - between right select star from student
02:55 - where wrong number between
03:14 - five zero two and five and four okay
03:23 - as you can see we are getting this same
03:26 - result in both of the queries so instead
03:30 - of using an keyword we can directly use
03:33 - between its subjects for the range the
03:37 - five zero two is the lowest and five and
03:43 - four is the biggest so if you have
03:47 - column like salary or any number that
03:52 - have specific ranges and you want to
03:55 - select the list of employees students or
04:01 - whatever they got set up present in your
04:03 - table you can use between keyword okay
04:08 - in this query you do not need to write
04:12 - the name of the column twice so just
04:16 - close this open MySQL workbench
04:27 - the method is same right select star
04:35 - from to rest where roll number between
04:48 - let's say five hundred and five and five
04:58 - as you can see these are the records
05:02 - which lies between 500 to five and five
05:07 - ok thanks for watching it
