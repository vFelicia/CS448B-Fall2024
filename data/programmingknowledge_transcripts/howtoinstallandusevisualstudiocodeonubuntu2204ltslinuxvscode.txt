01:52 - code on your Ubuntu operating system and
01:55 - once that command is finished Visual
01:57 - Studio code is installed on your Ubuntu
02:00 - operating system in order to open code
02:04 - you can just write code command here and
02:07 - then press enter is going to start
02:09 - Visual Studio code on your Ubuntu
02:11 - operating system
02:13 - you can also open Visual Studio code by
02:16 - going to the applications and search for
02:19 - code here and then
02:22 - you can just click on Visual Studio code
02:24 - icon and you can see it's been started
02:29 - if you want to add this to your
02:32 - favorites or you can lock this Visual
02:34 - Studio code to this dock you just need
02:37 - to right click on your Visual Studio
02:40 - code icon and then click on add to
02:42 - favorites and from the next time when
02:45 - you close this you can see this icon
02:47 - stays here so you can click on this icon
02:50 - and open Visual Studio code
02:53 - now in order to develop something you
02:57 - need to open a folder so just click on
03:00 - this icon here and then click on open
03:04 - folder and then you can open any folder
03:07 - of your choice
03:08 - uh where you want to create your project
03:11 - right so let's say I want to create a
03:14 - new folder here and I'm going to name
03:18 - this folder as
03:20 - works
03:21 - base here okay and then I'm going to
03:25 - create this folder and then I'm going to
03:27 - open this in my visual studio code
03:29 - editor so you can see
03:32 - this workspace folder is opened on
03:35 - Visual Studio code editor and here I can
03:38 - say I trust the author and here I can
03:41 - create any uh let's say file by clicking
03:45 - on this plus icon for the file I can
03:48 - also create folders let's create test
03:52 - dot py file and then press enter and
03:57 - then here
03:58 - once you create any file with any
04:01 - extension
04:03 - Visual Studio code is going to recognize
04:05 - that programming language right so
04:08 - because I have created test.py Visual
04:12 - Studio code recognizes it and it gives
04:15 - me the option to install python
04:18 - extension so when you go to the
04:20 - extensions section
04:22 - there are many popular extensions for
04:27 - many popular languages you can see
04:29 - python is here C plus plus you will find
04:32 - Java
04:34 - support for any uh language which is
04:37 - supported by Visual Studio code you will
04:40 - be able to see the extension for that
04:42 - language right so you can install that
04:45 - extension and that will help you to
04:48 - develop your code in a better way so
04:52 - here I can write print in
04:55 - my test.py file and then I can just
04:58 - write hello
05:00 - and vs code already recognizes it that
05:04 - it's a Python language and it's already
05:07 - a syntax highlighting this uh python
05:12 - file right
05:14 - so install the extension for python for
05:17 - example if you are developing Python and
05:20 - you will be good to go so this is how
05:22 - you can download and install and use
05:24 - Visual Studio code on your Ubuntu
05:27 - operating system I hope you've enjoyed
