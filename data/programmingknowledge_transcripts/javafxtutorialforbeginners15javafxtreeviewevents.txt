00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java effects tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - the last video I have shown you how to
00:06 - use tree view in Java FX and I have
00:09 - shown you how you can add the root and
00:11 - nodes to the tree view in the last video
00:15 - right and I have also shown you how to
00:16 - add these icons to the tree view now in
00:20 - this video we will see how we can add
00:22 - some mouse click event to these nodes
00:26 - right and I'm also going to show you how
00:28 - you can you know expand these root nodes
00:33 - in the tree view so for example right
00:36 - now when I run the app my root node is
00:41 - collapsed right so I need to expand it
00:44 - and expand it once again to go to the
00:46 - sub nodes right but for example I want
00:50 - to present the user the expanded nodes
00:53 - then how can I do that so let's see how
00:57 - can we do that so in my initialized
01:00 - method which I have created in the last
01:02 - video I have created this root so I want
01:05 - this root to be expanded so I can just
01:07 - take this root and call the method
01:10 - called set expanded and make it true
01:15 - okay and just save your code and run it
01:19 - once again and now you can see our root
01:23 - node childs are expanded so root node
01:27 - choice for node a node B and node C so
01:30 - they were expended but right now node a
01:33 - also have some child nodes so we want to
01:36 - expand these also so how we can do it we
01:39 - can do in the same way just copy this
01:41 - code and paste it here
01:44 - and now we want to expand the node a so
01:47 - just call node a dot sight expanded is
01:50 - equal to true and then run your code
01:53 - once again and now your whole tree is
01:56 - expanded okay now suppose I want to add
02:00 - a event to this tree view so that
02:04 - whenever I select some element I want to
02:07 - access the name of the node so what I
02:10 - can do here I can just create
02:13 - method public void and for example I can
02:18 - name my method as mouse click and as an
02:25 - argument I'm going to pass an argument
02:27 - called Mouse events so just pass an
02:30 - argument called Mouse event and name it
02:34 - and inside my method first of all what
02:36 - I'm going to do is I'm going to create
02:39 - an instance of tree item and then I will
02:44 - say this is the item object and then I
02:47 - will take my tree view object which is
02:50 - this one and just paste it here then
02:53 - just call get selection mode and then
02:58 - call get selected item okay and now you
03:04 - can just print the value for example you
03:07 - can just write this out and then you can
03:12 - just call this item here dot get value
03:17 - and this will give you the selected item
03:21 - name okay now one more thing we need to
03:24 - do here is we need to take this mouse
03:27 - click event and we will need to connect
03:30 - it with our F XML file so just copy this
03:33 - method and open your scene will der
03:36 - where you have this tree view select
03:38 - your tree view and go to the code
03:40 - category here and search for the event
03:45 - called context menu requested and paste
03:48 - this method there and one more place you
03:51 - need to paste this method name is on
03:54 - mouse clicked here okay so just you know
03:59 - call this method mouse click on context
04:02 - menu requested and on mouse click OK
04:05 - save your code and then go to your
04:08 - Eclipse project refresh your project and
04:11 - run it once again now when I click on
04:16 - some item here it's going to print the
04:19 - value of the item in here right so for
04:22 - example I select or single click node
04:25 - a is going to print node a for example I
04:28 - single click node C one is going to
04:31 - print node C one or I can just click
04:34 - node C is going to a print node C so
04:39 - this is how the single click is working
04:42 - for example you want to print the value
04:44 - on double-click so when I double click
04:47 - here right now it's printing two times
04:49 - right so let's add a double click here
04:53 - so you just need to add this condition
04:56 - here so just add an if statement and
04:59 - call this mouse event here and then call
05:03 - a method called get click count okay and
05:07 - we will count these clicks and if this
05:10 - mouse click count is equal to 2 which
05:13 - means double click then we want to you
05:16 - know execute our code here ok so just
05:19 - add this condition here and save your
05:23 - code and run it once again and now when
05:27 - I single click on any item it's not
05:30 - going to do anything but when I double
05:33 - click on item then it is going to print
05:36 - the value of the item okay so in this
05:40 - way you can add this mouse event to the
05:44 - tree view I hope you enjoyed this video
