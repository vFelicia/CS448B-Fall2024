00:00 - hello and welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge so in today's video I will be
00:04 - showing you the tops and programming
00:06 - languages to learn in the year 2020 so
00:09 - let's get started so the 7th programming
00:13 - language on the list is Gotland so
00:16 - cutting is a programming language for
00:18 - the java virtual machine and can
00:20 - therefore be used anywhere Java is used
00:22 - today which is virtually anywhere so
00:25 - this includes server client web and
00:28 - Android development it's currently
00:30 - predominantly used for Android app
00:32 - development so first portal is a way
00:34 - more concise than Java in many cases
00:36 - solving the same problems with fewer
00:38 - lines of code so this simply this
00:40 - improves the code maintainability and
00:42 - readability and quarrelin code is
00:44 - inherently safer than Java core because
00:46 - it prevents common programming mistakes
00:48 - by design such as null pointer exception
00:51 - so if you know how to develop Android
00:53 - apps using Java or you know Java then
00:56 - you can surely try Kotlin you will be
00:58 - amazed with the simplicity of it I'll
00:59 - give you the links to all the resources
01:01 - in the description of the video so next
01:04 - programming language on our list it's C
01:07 - or C++ so we will start with C C the
01:10 - general purpose procedural computer
01:12 - programming language now why should you
01:14 - learn it so many essential programs
01:16 - libraries operating systems and
01:19 - firmwares
01:19 - are implemented in c and there will
01:21 - always be a need for developers to
01:23 - maintain them as long as they exist so
01:25 - it's a good investment to learn C in any
01:27 - case if you want to contribute or to
01:29 - understand Linux at a low level so you
01:32 - need an appropriate proficiency level in
01:34 - C the same applies if you want to
01:36 - develop firmware for microcontroller
01:38 - based embedded system so all the
01:40 - low-level stuff is a developing C so if
01:43 - you want to move on to the
01:45 - microcontroller or firmware or kernel
01:48 - libraries development field then you can
01:50 - surely go and learn about see next is
01:53 - C++ so C++ is a highly efficient and
01:56 - flexible language so it was created in
01:58 - 1985 very old but still it is in very
02:01 - high demand due to its high performance
02:03 - so C++ is very powerful efficient and
02:06 - fast language it is often used to
02:08 - develop game engines game
02:10 - in desktop apps so nowadays you see the
02:12 - Python is the number one programming
02:13 - language in the world but Python is a
02:15 - high-level language inside Python on a
02:18 - lower side the Python is developed using
02:20 - the C++ engine due to which the Python
02:24 - is little bit slow as it is interpreted
02:26 - language so as you know that everything
02:28 - under the hood contains C or C++ code so
02:32 - having the basic knowledge of for a C or
02:34 - C plus this code will give a better
02:36 - understanding of programming in general
02:37 - the next parameter in our list is swift
02:40 - 50 is Apple's newest language for iOS
02:44 - and Mac OS development so it is also
02:46 - used for our TV where's that is a new
02:49 - ways for Apple TV 50 is basically used
02:51 - in all of the Apple devices so it is
02:54 - designed to replace decades-old
02:56 - objective-c so now if you know Swift
02:59 - then you can easily great apps for iOS
03:01 - devices there is huge market for iOS
03:04 - devices as you can see many people are
03:07 - using areas and can create a career by
03:09 - learning Swift language and becoming an
03:11 - iOS developer there are not many changes
03:13 - in Swift language right now shift wise
03:15 - the stable language and you can learn it
03:17 - very easily in three months of time and
03:19 - you can get a good salary package whole
03:21 - at Apple ecosystem can be developed
03:23 - using Swift swift code is safe by design
03:25 - yet also produces software that runs
03:27 - lightning-fast as you can see if you
03:30 - have use any time on an Apple phones you
03:32 - can see that iPhone apps those are
03:34 - really fast they don't have that much
03:36 - amount of RAM but still they are very
03:39 - much faster as compared to the Android
03:41 - metering devices the next language in
03:43 - our released is go so go you can also
03:46 - call it as galling so go is a simple
03:48 - language but it is more efficient as
03:50 - compared to C++ go is also language like
03:53 - Python so the people who love Python
03:55 - also love to use this language so cool
03:57 - language is designed by Google and go
04:00 - language is meant mainly useful for
04:02 - building large scale and complex
04:03 - applications if you want to learn a new
04:05 - language you should start with the core
04:08 - programming it is a most demanding
04:10 - programming language of 2020 many fields
04:12 - such as a container orchestration system
04:14 - such as kubernetes or docker are written
04:18 - in go language so if you want to make a
04:20 - career in our DevOps it is
04:22 - operations failed then he should surely
04:24 - learn : next language on our list is
04:27 - Java so you must hear about Java
04:29 - language whether you are in development
04:31 - field or not - it is portable and you
04:33 - can roll it anywhere on any operating
04:35 - system so it is used for big data also
04:38 - many frameworks for big data such as
04:40 - Apache spark Apache Hadoop are written
04:43 - in Java and also if you are going for a
04:46 - web development there are frameworks
04:48 - such as Java springboard which are very
04:51 - famous and you can get easily a job if
04:54 - you are having a knowledge of Java
04:55 - springboard and hibernate so once you go
04:59 - through the java programming language
05:00 - you mastered it then you can go and
05:02 - start building your web applications
05:04 - back-end using spring MVC it is Model
05:07 - View controller and you don't create
05:09 - front-end using a normal HTML CSS
05:12 - JavaScript and in the backend we can use
05:15 - spring boot so this is a Java stack so
05:17 - it is hot topic right now because spring
05:20 - boot is very stable
05:21 - and it is production ready in work if
05:23 - you already know Java and you want to
05:24 - get in the web development field you can
05:27 - surely take a string boot and become a
05:30 - full stack developer the next language
05:32 - you know released is Python
05:34 - so I have put Python second you know
05:36 - list is because the ranking doesn't
05:39 - matter for Python and JavaScript today's
05:41 - world you should know both of them
05:42 - because those are really top trending
05:44 - languages in the industry care and if
05:47 - you know both of them you can surely get
05:50 - a job so let's start with Python so
05:52 - python is one of the programming
05:53 - languages that is widely used all over
05:55 - the world it can help develop their
05:57 - applications network servers desktop
05:59 - applications medical tools and machine
06:02 - learning data science all of things -
06:04 - Python is an excellent choice for
06:05 - beginners we are also planning to learn
06:07 - new programming language then you should
06:09 - definitely choose Python because python
06:11 - syntax is so very easy it is like we are
06:15 - writing an English language because you
06:17 - don't have semicolons curly braces all
06:19 - those things with which normal
06:21 - programming language will have Python
06:23 - can be very useful for developing
06:24 - back-end api's so if you are creating a
06:27 - library website and if you want to fetch
06:29 - some fields from
06:31 - blade ah base so you will surely create
06:33 - an API that person provides different
06:35 - frameworks like Django
06:36 - flasks using these frameworks could
06:38 - create api's if you are going into web
06:41 - development you should surely take into
06:43 - consideration flask and Django the main
06:45 - field that Python is a shining is in
06:48 - data science from small startups to
06:50 - major corporations there's the growing
06:52 - realization that mining data sets Forex
06:55 - table the insight is the best route to
06:57 - growth and it is also well compensated
06:59 - one will get a good salary package if
07:01 - you know Python packages such as
07:03 - scikit-learn numpy pandas I will be
07:06 - creating a video tutorial series on
07:08 - pandas library politicized so please
07:11 - look out for that also so python is also
07:14 - used in IOT like an Internet of Things
07:15 - cross-platform desktop applications in
07:18 - testing automation EPS scrapping isin is
07:21 - very easy you can learn it and you can
07:23 - choose that file you want to go data
07:25 - science
07:25 - or if you want to if you're interested
07:27 - in web development and it is back-end
07:29 - you can go with the flask in Jungle if
07:32 - you're into IOT you can create IOT
07:35 - applications go into desktop
07:37 - applications creating then you can go
07:39 - for a different icon frameworks such as
07:41 - a TK inter PI QT 5 and in many
07:45 - universities all over the world Python
07:47 - is a standard language to start in the
07:49 - engineering colleges and python has a
07:52 - very huge community so if you get stuck
07:55 - in any error you can get the help from
07:57 - the community very easily approach the
07:59 - language in our list it's JavaScript oh
08:01 - why JavaScript is so much important
08:03 - javascript is it interpreted in language
08:05 - it pure mean language same is Python and
08:08 - moreover JavaScript plays a significant
08:11 - role in front-end development it is
08:12 - mainly used in web development so you
08:15 - already know HTML CSS and JavaScript you
08:18 - can surely go with learning the es6
08:21 - framework of javascript then you can
08:23 - move on to front-end frameworks that
08:25 - ease of reactors or angularjs or buges
08:29 - it can be also used for back-end
08:31 - development with the help of node.js
08:33 - framework and there are also other
08:35 - frameworks such as ember.js or expressed
08:39 - years due to this reason most of them
08:42 - you startups use this javascript to
08:44 - handle the back end processes and there
08:46 - are a lot of opportunities for web
08:48 - developer with knowledge of
08:50 - DreamWorks so should definitely look out
08:54 - for JavaScript if you are going for
08:55 - front-end development and there is a lot
08:58 - of scope for jobs in JavaScript if you
09:01 - know any one framework like react.js and
09:04 - if you know back end with the Django or
09:07 - you can consider nodejs you will surely
09:11 - get a job in the industry is a fresher
09:13 - so my personal advice to you would be
09:16 - learn both of the languages that is
09:19 - Python and JavaScript and you can also
09:21 - see that Microsoft supports now
09:23 - officially react native it means that
09:25 - you will be able to do back-end with
09:28 - node.js front-end bootstrap for instance
09:31 - and mobile applications like iOS and
09:34 - Android
09:34 - and desktop Windows applications we
09:36 - react native framework so everything
09:38 - using react new to and it is interned
09:41 - with JavaScript and Python is also an
09:43 - amazing language and it is the number
09:45 - one in such trends because it's easiest
09:47 - and the most recommended language to
09:48 - learn but don't get me wrong we're
09:51 - really it shines in these days is data
09:54 - science I turn has n number of libraries
09:57 - for statistics and data science like
09:59 - machine learning deep learning and all
10:01 - those data engineering field combined
10:03 - the best of both of these languages and
10:06 - you will be able to write code in react
10:08 - native and deployed anywhere and the
10:10 - spare time you can improve the project
10:12 - with data science and for example sell
10:14 - it like premium features so I hope you
10:17 - do something great by learning these
10:19 - programming languages and all the best
10:20 - for you all new year
