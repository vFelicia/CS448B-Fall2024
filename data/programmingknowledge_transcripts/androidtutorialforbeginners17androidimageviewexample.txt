00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use images in your Android
00:10 - activity and also we are going to make a
00:14 - cool app uh to change im images on
00:18 - button click so let's get started first
00:22 - of all we are going to add some images
00:25 - to our app so go to your uh project and
00:30 - search for the folder called app and
00:32 - inside this folder you will be able to
00:34 - see this folder called Rees or resources
00:37 - folder and inside this resources folder
00:40 - there will be a folder called
00:42 - drawable so all your images you are want
00:46 - to uh you know keep inside this drawable
00:49 - folder so this is the folder for keeping
00:52 - all your uh image resources so go to
00:56 - this drawable folder right click on this
00:59 - drawable folder ER and go to new and
01:03 - click the option called image asset okay
01:06 - so click the option called image asset
01:10 - and in here you can add four type of uh
01:16 - image or whatever image you uh choose it
01:21 - will be converted into four types one is
01:25 - hdpi which is high DPI second is medium
01:29 - M DPI or
01:31 - mdpi third is X DPI or H
01:36 - xhdpi which is extra high DPI and uh XX
01:42 - D xxh DPI so high quality DPI this is
01:46 - also
01:48 - so I'm just going to click okay just
01:52 - choose one of them uh it doesn't matter
01:55 - which one you choose because whatever
01:58 - image you will choose it will be
02:00 - converted into all these formats right
02:04 - so just click okay and in here you will
02:08 - see uh there is a PNG a default PNG file
02:13 - already provided by our project and in
02:16 - here now we want to add our new files so
02:20 - I have uh two uh Android icons here in
02:23 - my folder you can find the Android icons
02:26 - easily on internet or on some site so uh
02:31 - download these uh icons from here these
02:35 - are PNG images in my case but uh they
02:38 - can be different now what I'm going to
02:42 - do is I'm going to give my resource name
02:45 - first so for
02:46 - example uh a and
02:50 - Dore image
02:53 - 1 so uh this is the resource name you
02:57 - need to give uh for your image okay and
03:02 - uh asset type is launcher icon and in
03:05 - here uh in the image file you just need
03:10 - to give the path of your image okay so
03:14 - for example my image path for this is I
03:19 - will just copy the path here and paste
03:22 - it here and then I can see my folder and
03:26 - in here I can choose my PNG file one is
03:30 - PNG file and other is JPG file so I'm
03:34 - going to take both of the files and show
03:36 - you um that both of them works so first
03:40 - of all I will choose this Android one
03:43 - JPG file from here and then this file
03:47 - will be converted into these four
03:50 - formats right and then I will click
03:55 - next and all these options are okay and
03:59 - I will click finish and once you click
04:01 - finish you will be able to see there are
04:03 - four type of images generated which is
04:05 - hdpi mdpi xhdpi and xx hdpi four types
04:11 - of images inside your drawable folder
04:16 - these four types of images are generated
04:19 - because uh you know your app will be
04:22 - able to uh resize these images on the
04:25 - basis of the phone size right that's
04:29 - that's why it has generated these four
04:31 - IM type of
04:33 - images I am going to add one more
04:36 - resource in the same
04:45 - way click next and finish so now I have
04:48 - added two images inside my drawable
04:51 - folder right now in order to add these
04:55 - images to your Android activity there is
04:58 - a widget called image view so you can
05:00 - drag and drop this widget here and in
05:05 - here you can uh resize this uh widget
05:09 - also but first of all what we are going
05:12 - to do is we are going to uh add some
05:16 - resource to this widget so just double
05:19 - click this widget and then in the source
05:24 - you just uh need to choose your source
05:27 - so just click this small button
05:30 - uh at the side of this source and in
05:33 - here you will be able to see at the
05:35 - bottom your two images and D image 1 and
05:41 - a and d image 2 okay so I'm going to
05:44 - choose the first image and click okay
05:48 - and now you will be able to see the your
05:50 - image here what I'm going to do is I'm
05:53 - going to add a button here okay
06:00 - and I'm going to uh change this button
06:03 - uh name as switch
06:06 - image so I'm going to use this for
06:09 - switching
06:10 - image
06:13 - switch image
06:17 - okay now you can notice that the size of
06:20 - this image is not uh you know uh fitting
06:24 - to your Android activity so you can drag
06:28 - the the side of of your image and resize
06:32 - it like this okay and it will be resized
06:36 - but by resizing this image view uh you
06:40 - will also notice that this uh size of
06:43 - this image stays the same which is small
06:47 - size right now in order to stretch your
06:50 - image according to the size of this
06:52 - image view what you can do is there is a
06:55 - property here in your property so select
06:58 - your image view here here and search for
07:01 - the
07:02 - property called scale type and in the
07:06 - properties there will be a property
07:09 - called scale type in here and by default
07:14 - this will be sent uh you know scale type
07:18 - so when you click this uh section here
07:22 - in front of the scale type property you
07:25 - will be able to change your uh you know
07:29 - scale type type so I'm going to choose
07:32 - fit Center and it's going to get little
07:36 - bit bigger according to the center right
07:39 - and you can choose uh other properties
07:43 - of scale type to fit your
07:51 - requirement for us uh fit Center is okay
07:55 - for now okay so now uh what I'm going to
07:59 - do is I'm going to add a click event to
08:03 - this button and we are going to uh
08:07 - choose the second image using uh this
08:11 - button so we are going to uh make an app
08:14 - whenever users click this button is
08:18 - going to change this images again and
08:20 - again and again okay so what I'm going
08:22 - to do is I'm going to go to my
08:26 - uh main activity. Java file so just
08:29 - click this file and in here first of all
08:33 - we are going to uh declare our two uh
08:38 - image View and button variables
08:52 - right so now we have uh declared our two
08:56 - variables and now we are going to create
08:59 - a method which we are going to call in
09:01 - our on create method so let's create a
09:05 - method
09:07 - public
09:14 - wide button click method for example and
09:18 - inside
09:19 - this first of all we are going to cast
09:22 - these two variables one is for image and
09:25 - we will assign the ID of the widget to
09:44 - them so now we have casted our variables
09:48 - and now we are going to take this button
09:50 - submit and we are going to set our on
09:53 - click method to it so button sub submit
09:56 - do set on click listener and inside this
09:59 - on click listener we are going to call a
10:02 - new on click
10:05 - listener now inside this onclick method
10:09 - what we are going to do is first of all
10:11 - let's declare two more variables at the
10:15 - top and these variables will be one for
10:20 - current image index so this will
10:26 - be private int
10:32 - current
10:35 - image index and second we are going to
10:39 - declare an INT array for the images
10:46 - so
10:47 - images is equal to and we are going to
10:50 - initialize this array by the images
10:55 - themselves so we are going to find the
10:57 - ID of these imag
11:00 - these images are in the drawable folder
11:03 - you can see here so we can just find the
11:06 - them by r dot
11:10 - drawable dot now the name of this so my
11:15 - first image name
11:17 - is and image 1 in the same way you can
11:23 - uh find second image so so I'm going to
11:26 - add this third image called icore
11:29 - launcher which was already present so R
11:33 - do
11:38 - drawable do
11:40 - iore launcher okay so now we have array
11:46 - of three
11:47 - images in this image variable right so
11:51 - now in our on click method what we are
11:54 - going to do is first of all we are going
11:57 - to increase the index of this current
12:00 - image so current image
12:03 - Plus+ and then uh this current image uh
12:08 - will be we are going to assign it to the
12:11 - current image
12:14 - modulus the length of your length of
12:19 - your uh image array so we are going to
12:23 - take this
12:25 - images variable dot length
12:30 - okay so now what we are going to do is
12:33 - on the basis of this index we can uh you
12:37 - know call this index which will indicate
12:41 - this uh these uh images one by one right
12:45 - so what I'm going to do is in this image
12:47 - view
12:48 - variable I'm going to set the image so
12:52 - image view dot
12:55 - set and I'm going to set the image and
12:59 - this will be the image resource so set
13:03 - image resource and then we are going to
13:07 - take this array of image and then we are
13:11 - going to call these images on the basis
13:14 - of index and index uh is this one
13:20 - right so now uh our code is ready one uh
13:25 - more thing we need to do is we need to
13:27 - call this button click event inside our
13:32 - oncreate method right now uh we are
13:36 - ready so we are going to run
13:38 - our app so now our app is running and
13:42 - you can see this image on our activity
13:46 - and let's uh click this button and let's
13:49 - see what happens while clicking this
13:52 - button so I'm going to click this button
13:55 - and the image changes once again I'm
13:57 - going to click this button and the image
14:00 - changes so every time you click this
14:04 - button this index changes in the image
14:09 - array and we can see new
14:12 - array or if you want to just set one
14:16 - image what you can do is instead of uh
14:20 - writing this code and in here you can
14:22 - directly call your r. drawable do
14:26 - whatever image name you have inside here
14:29 - okay and this will just call your one
14:32 - image and it will not switch our images
14:35 - one by one by one okay so this is direct
14:39 - calling of image using this uh set image
14:44 - resources so I hope you have enjoyed
