00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to print
00:05 - date and time of the server on which
00:08 - your PHP file
00:10 - resides uh using your PHP code so
00:13 - basically I want to print the time or
00:15 - time and date of uh your server because
00:19 - these file all will be on the server
00:22 - right so let's see how we can print date
00:24 - and time using this server so I can just
00:27 - declare a variable called date
00:30 - first of all I need to save this I'll
00:33 - save it
00:35 - as date time do
00:41 - PHP and now it's date is equal to and
00:45 - there is a special function called date
00:49 - in PHP which is used to uh give us the
00:54 - date right now this takes one argument
00:59 - or more than than one argument depending
01:01 - upon uh the user whatever argument you
01:04 - want to give here so for
01:07 - example I want to uh give the date in
01:12 - some format so for example I want to
01:15 - give the date in this format first of
01:18 - all the day and then so for example day
01:23 - slash
01:25 - month
01:27 - slash uh
01:28 - year okay so I can achieve this like
01:33 - this so for day I can give small D and
01:37 - then slash so and month small M and for
01:43 - year capital Y okay and let's just Echo
01:48 - this
01:50 - Echo
01:53 - date date
01:56 - okay save this refresh this and run this
02:02 - you will be able to see the current date
02:04 - of the server which is on the server and
02:08 - right now it's 78
02:10 - 2014 right but you can for example you
02:14 - want to change this format you want to
02:17 - add day point month
02:21 - point then what you need to do is you
02:24 - just need to change the format of this
02:26 - string like d point a month Point m
02:30 - point small m point okay I will refresh
02:34 - this and now I can see the point here
02:38 - for example I want the dash a minus
02:41 - symbol I can do it like this so it
02:43 - depends upon you what format you need
02:46 - you just need to give the format here
02:48 - and I will refresh it and I get the this
02:53 - um date like this now for example I need
02:56 - the time I can declare a variable called
03:00 - time is equal to and I can still use
03:03 - this date function to give the time so
03:07 - it can
03:10 - take the format of the time also so for
03:13 - example I want time something like this
03:16 - I want to show first of
03:19 - all
03:21 - the
03:24 - hours
03:27 - hours like this and and
03:31 - then minutes and then SE uh I mean
03:36 - seconds
03:38 - right then how can I do this I can just
03:43 - write here capital r r
03:51 - minus and then small I for minutes and
03:55 - then minus for a second I think I should
03:59 - use S s right save it and I want to Echo
04:04 - this Echo
04:08 - time
04:10 - time and let me put break here so the
04:15 - date and Di will be printed on different
04:18 - lines
04:19 - BR
04:22 - with single codes okay and now I will
04:26 - refresh this and I can see the time here
04:30 - also so time is
04:33 - 030 and the second is
04:37 - 5 you can change this by changing the
04:40 - format like this for example you want
04:42 - the format like this hour minute and
04:45 - seconds you can always change it like
04:49 - this okay so the format depends upon
04:53 - you whatever format you want to see you
04:57 - will be able to see now
05:00 - you may want to display your day as a
05:05 - string for example wedness day or
05:07 - something like this there are many
05:10 - combination to show your date and time
05:13 - and I have just shown you few of these
05:16 - options now if you want to know more
05:20 - about uh the for for formats for example
05:24 - this D whenever you use it shows uh the
05:28 - day in these
05:30 - two letters or whatever you say but I
05:34 - whenever I use this capital D let's see
05:37 - what happens whenever I use capital D
05:40 - and refresh it it shows me day in the
05:43 - format of three letter word right today
05:47 - is Thursday so it's giving me day like
05:50 - this so there are many combinations
05:53 - possible to show date and time and to
05:56 - more about this uh table of uh the the
06:00 - the formats you can just go to your
06:03 - php.net and search for date here and in
06:08 - here you will find the function date and
06:12 - here you will find the list of the
06:14 - format characters so you can see small D
06:17 - is for day of month two digit right
06:20 - capital D is a text texal representation
06:24 - of day in three letters J is the day of
06:27 - month without leading zeros and you can
06:31 - see all kind of letter or characters
06:34 - which you can use to represent your date
