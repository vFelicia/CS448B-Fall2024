00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to install
00:05 - Eclipse with CDT plug-in on your Ubuntu
00:08 - operating system so why CDT plug-in is
00:12 - important is because if you want to run
00:17 - build and compile C and C++ program in
00:20 - your Eclipse IDE you need to have this
00:24 - plug-in installed which is called
00:27 - CDT so I will show you
00:30 - only a single command to install Eclipse
00:34 - with this CDT plug-in so open your
00:38 - terminal and just
00:40 - write pseudo apt minus get installed
00:45 - Eclipse
00:47 - space
00:48 - Eclipse Das
00:50 - CDT space
00:53 - g++ so this is the command you need to
00:56 - write on the terminal and just press
00:59 - enter
01:01 - and it will ask you whether you want
01:06 - to allocate the memory so say yes and
01:13 - press
01:18 - enter and it may take few minutes to
01:23 - install uh Eclipse with this CDT plug-in
01:28 - depending upon the speed of your
01:43 - computer so you can see it's still
01:47 - installing and the progress is about 99%
01:52 - now and
01:54 - 100% And
01:58 - it's extracting the
02:14 - templates once your installation is
02:17 - complete you can go
02:20 - to
02:23 - here and click this Dash
02:28 - home

03:18 - eclipse for the first time it may take
03:21 - some time to
03:28 - open
03:31 - and it will ask you

03:38 - want this workspace then click
03:41 - okay and now our Eclipse IDE will
03:58 - open
04:00 - so our Eclipse ID is open now let's try
