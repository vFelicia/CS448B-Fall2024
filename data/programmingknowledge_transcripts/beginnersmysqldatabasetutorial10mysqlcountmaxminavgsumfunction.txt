00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:03 - video we will see how we can take some
00:08 - average maximum and minimum
00:12 - of the columns so for example I have
00:17 - this table and I want
00:20 - to find out the sum of all ages of all
00:25 - employees or I want to find out the
00:28 - average age of employees in my company
00:32 - or I want to find out who is the oldest
00:36 - person in my company or who is the
00:38 - youngest person in my company how I I
00:42 - can do that I will show you right
00:46 - now so in your query tab
00:51 - write
00:55 - select
00:57 - age from
01:01 - your
01:03 - database do table
01:09 - name
01:13 - and now it's important to see here this
01:18 - select age age
01:21 - you cover with brackets and outside this
01:27 - bracket write
01:32 - sum so this will give me the sum of Ages
01:37 - of the employee I will write here I will
01:41 - execute this
01:42 - quy and I can see here the sum of the
01:48 - ages is 2
01:51 - 87 in the same way I want to find the
01:55 - average so I will
01:58 - write AVG before my
02:02 - age and I will execute the query and you
02:05 - can see the average age of employees in
02:08 - my company is
02:10 - 41 in the same way I want to find the
02:13 - oldest person so I will write max
02:19 - age and I will execute the query and
02:24 - maximum age of the employee in my
02:27 - company is
02:28 - 55 for minimum age just
02:32 - write
02:34 - Min and execute query the minimum age is
02:43 - 27 and suppose you want to find out how
02:47 - many employees or how many rows my table
02:53 - contains you can
02:55 - do or count your rows also
03:00 - from
03:03 - writing
03:04 - count age or any column you can write
03:09 - here for example name also and I
03:14 - will execute the query and the number of
03:18 - rows in which name are present
03:21 - is
03:22 - 7 so in this way you can use this
03:28 - select statement for finding out maximum
03:33 - average minimum and sum of these
03:38 - values so I hope you have learned
03:40 - something new this time please RIT
03:42 - comment and subscribe bye for now
