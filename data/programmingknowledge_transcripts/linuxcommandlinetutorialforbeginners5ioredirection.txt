00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video I'm going to
00:05 - show you how we can use redirection in
00:09 - Linux first of all what is redirection
00:12 - redirection simply means capturing
00:15 - output from a file command or program
00:18 - and sending it as an input to another
00:21 - file command or program and let's see
00:24 - what are the options we have for the
00:27 - redirection so for example you want to
00:31 - uh you know transfer some things some
00:33 - output so I will just write output here
00:37 - and then you want to redirect it to a
00:39 - file for example so in this case we want
00:42 - to send some output to a file and the
00:46 - pointing uh you know end of this arrow
00:49 - is the direction of your output so you
00:52 - want to send the output to the file so
00:55 - this point means the direction of your
00:59 - output
01:00 - right so let's see how we can use it so
01:03 - in the last video I've shown you how we
01:06 - can use cat command in Linux so we are
01:08 - going to use this cat command to uh
01:11 - create a file and then uh transferring
01:15 - our uh you know stream to this file so
01:18 - just write cat here and then this angle
01:22 - bracket this means uh we want to
01:25 - redirect our uh you know input or
01:28 - whatever output we are going to type in
01:31 - the terminal to a file and uh let's name
01:35 - a file something so for example text. uh
01:40 - txt okay and when I press enter here you
01:44 - will see there is a new file created
01:47 - right as soon as you press enter now
01:51 - whatever you write here then this
01:53 - content will be written to the file for
01:56 - example I will just write uh line one
02:00 - line uh two line uh three for example
02:05 - and this will be written to your file
02:08 - and to uh you know show the end of the
02:11 - file you just need to press control and
02:13 - D so just press control D to uh you know
02:17 - indicate that this is the end of your
02:19 - file and then you are uh out of this
02:22 - scad command and let's see what's the
02:24 - content of this test file so I can just
02:28 - uh cat this uh test file here so just
02:31 - press enter and you can see uh the
02:34 - content of this uh test. txd file
02:39 - right now for example what I want to do
02:42 - is I want to once again uh transfer
02:45 - something else uh to this file so once
02:48 - again I will just uh do cat with this uh
02:52 - angle bracket and then the file name and
02:56 - then this time I want to add for example
02:59 - line uh
03:00 - four here and then line uh five for
03:05 - example and let's say I want to add one
03:08 - more line for example line six here okay
03:13 - and then I will just uh press controll D
03:17 - to end this uh file and now I want to
03:22 - see the content of this file so I will
03:24 - just give cat. test.txt right and press
03:28 - enter and now you will see that this
03:32 - test.txt file contains line four five
03:35 - and six and earlier whatever content we
03:38 - have written to the file is overwritten
03:41 - by the new content right this content
03:44 - now for example you want to append uh to
03:47 - the file you want uh that this file
03:51 - should not be overwritten but it should
03:53 - be whatever uh you want to add to a file
03:56 - it will be added from the next line for
03:59 - example right so what we do in that case
04:03 - we give the same command with two angle
04:06 - brackets so this is for appending to the
04:10 - existing content of a file right so when
04:13 - you give two angle brackets and press
04:16 - enter and now I will say
04:19 - line S here line uh 8 and
04:24 - line nine for example okay and I will
04:28 - press control d and then once again I
04:30 - will see the content of the file and now
04:33 - it shows me uh line 345 which is from my
04:38 - last uh you know command and then I have
04:41 - added these three new lines so if you
04:44 - want to append to the existing content
04:47 - of a file you may want to use these two
04:50 - angle brackets okay now sometimes you
04:54 - want to uh you know add two files and
04:58 - then transfer the content to the new
05:01 - file right so I have these uh two uh
05:05 - files list one and list two for example
05:09 - so let me show you the content of these
05:11 - two file first I will clear the terminal
05:14 - it should be
05:15 - clear and press enter and then cat list
05:20 - one for example and it contains uh these
05:23 - three lines and let me show you the
05:26 - content of uh list two also so it
05:29 - contains these uh three lines also right
05:32 - now I want to add the content of these
05:35 - two files and transfer it to a new file
05:38 - so what I can do is I can just write cat
05:42 - and then I will just uh write the name
05:44 - of these two files list one and then
05:47 - space list uh two and then I will give
05:51 - the angle bracket here something like
05:54 - this and then I want to transfer the
05:56 - content to a new file for example let's
05:59 - say say its uh name is
06:02 - out.txt
06:04 - something like this okay and let me make
06:07 - it little bit bigger so we can see the
06:09 - command so this is the command so I want
06:12 - to join these two files and then
06:14 - transfer the content of uh the
06:16 - concatenation of these two files to a
06:19 - new file so when I press enter the new
06:23 - file will be created this file already
06:25 - exist here so it's not creating but if
06:28 - uh it doesn't exit it will create this
06:30 - file and then when I see the content of
06:33 - this out. text file I can see uh the
06:37 - combination of uh our two files so in
06:40 - this way you can add uh any number of
06:42 - fil for example you have three or four
06:44 - files you can just write list one list
06:46 - two list three and list four and then
06:48 - redirect it to a new file now for
06:51 - example I would just want to uh redirect
06:54 - the content of these two file to the
06:58 - file two itself so what should I do I
07:01 - can just write something like this so I
07:04 - just write uh cat list one list two and
07:07 - I want to uh transfer the output to the
07:09 - list to itself so I will just write here
07:13 - list two and press enter and it says
07:17 - input file is output file here right so
07:21 - you cannot do this like this so what you
07:24 - need to do here you need to do something
07:27 - like this so you just need to give the
07:31 - list one. text and then append it to the
07:35 - second file which is our list 2.txt file
07:39 - right instead of uh giving this command
07:42 - if you give uh this command this will
07:44 - work so when you press enter this
07:47 - command is executed and let's see the
07:49 - content of uh list two now so just write
07:52 - list uh 2. text and press enter and now
07:56 - you can see list two contain the
07:58 - combination of uh these two files right
08:02 - so in this way you can use redirection
08:05 - in Linux so it's not uh you know
08:08 - particularly related to the cat command
08:11 - you can do the same thing with for
08:13 - example I will just write LS minus Al to
08:17 - uh out. text so I will just write out.
08:21 - text and press enter and when I see the
08:25 - content of out. text it'll give me the
08:28 - output of L Command right so it's not
08:31 - particularly related to cat command you
08:34 - can use this redirection to uh any other
08:39 - command with any other command for
08:41 - example LS or CD or any other command or
08:44 - program right so I hope you've enjoyed

08:49 - and bye for now
