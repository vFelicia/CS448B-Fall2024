00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to the
00:02 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
00:04 - going to talk about
00:06 - very important tools that are present in
00:08 - the join tab of the ultrex tool now
00:11 - these tools are defined and the replace
00:13 - tool as the name suggests they help you
00:15 - to find for the values and if you want
00:17 - to replace your found value with any
00:19 - other value so for that also this tool
00:22 - is used okay
00:23 - so here in the workflow as you can
00:25 - already see i have input the data that
00:27 - is the sample superstore data
00:29 - and i have applied two data cleansing
00:31 - operations so this i have already
00:33 - explained in the previous videos in case
00:35 - you have not seen the videos i would
00:37 - recommend you to go and watch them to
00:38 - easily understand that what's going on
00:40 - here
00:40 - now once your data is clean let us make
00:43 - use of the find and replace tool it is
00:45 - present in the joined app so here is the
00:46 - join nav and here is the finance replace
00:48 - tool let me just drag it over here
00:50 - now let us understand this tool it is
00:53 - used to find a string in one column of a
00:55 - data set and look up and replace it with
00:57 - the specified value from another data
00:59 - set right
01:01 - so you can use it to append columns as
01:04 - well
01:06 - now
01:07 - if we take a look at the configuration
01:09 - tab we have this find section and the
01:11 - replay section there are two different
01:13 - sections right in the find section we
01:15 - have these three radio buttons that can
01:17 - be chosen as per our wish
01:20 - first is beginning of field that
01:21 - searches for the instance of the field
01:23 - value at the beginning of the field the
01:26 - entire field does not have to contain
01:27 - what is being searched for
01:30 - next we have any part of the field which
01:32 - means it would search for the instance
01:33 - of the field value in any part of the
01:35 - field the entire field again does not
01:38 - have to be containing what is being
01:40 - searched for
01:41 - third is the entire field that it would
01:43 - search for the instance of the field
01:45 - value contained within the entire field
01:48 - the instance must be there in its
01:50 - entirety to be replaced with the new
01:53 - value then we have find within field
01:55 - option
01:56 - which is used to select the field in the
01:58 - table with the data to be replaced
02:01 - f is the input anchor
02:03 - by the data in the reference table and r
02:05 - is the input anchor uh that is being
02:08 - specified by which data to be replaced
02:11 - okay next we have is the find value that
02:14 - is um used to select the field from the
02:16 - reference table that is the r
02:18 - that contains the same values as the
02:20 - find within table in the original table
02:23 - okay
02:24 - next we have the case and sensitive find
02:26 - and match the whole word only so
02:29 - what we will do is
02:31 - if we take a look at this orders table
02:33 - this we would be connecting to the
02:35 - replays okay
02:37 - next we would be getting another in out
02:39 - and let me just get the input data
02:42 - here what i have done is let me just
02:44 - move it a little bit here
02:47 - so what i have done uh is i have made
02:49 - some changes into the subcategory field
02:52 - and the category fields okay
02:54 - so what i'm gonna do is just
02:56 - first of all get the file over here
03:00 - and this is the file that i want
03:08 - yeah
03:09 - so here let's just click on okay
03:15 - and connect it to the find values okay
03:18 - so it is going to find the values
03:21 - and replace it okay
03:23 - so let me just go back to this tool
03:26 - if i just click on the output anchor of
03:28 - this first field what we would be
03:31 - getting here
03:34 - is 100 records actually
03:37 - and here you can see the uh sub category
03:40 - chairs is having a different spelling
03:43 - means there are some of the white spaces
03:44 - but in the case of this the output angle
03:47 - of the data cleansed field
03:49 - we will find that in the subcategory
03:52 - the chairs are correct okay so we need
03:54 - to find the value of chairs and replace
03:56 - it with this that means the subcategory
03:58 - field would be employed so let's just
04:00 - click on this uh entire field
04:03 - sub category and replace it with a
04:06 - subcategory value okay
04:08 - and
04:09 - that's the case in sensitive fine or
04:11 - let's just keep all the settings as this
04:13 - only and click on run
04:16 - now you can see that
04:19 - we have find
04:21 - in this f targets there are a number of
04:23 - records and in the r target that's the
04:24 - source there are a number of records
04:27 - if we click on the output anchor so the
04:29 - total number of records is 5191 that
04:32 - means the field where we have replaced
04:34 - the values right
04:36 - and the values would have been replaced
04:38 - over here
04:42 - okay so here we can just select the
04:44 - subcategory again
04:46 - and click on run
04:56 - so this is how the find and the replace
04:58 - tool works it is used to replace the
05:00 - values right
05:02 - so this was all about the find section
05:04 - let us now focus on the replace section
05:06 - so we have replace found text with value
05:09 - that means we have to choose the field
05:11 - from the reference table
05:13 - to update the original table that means
05:14 - the fine table
05:16 - if you want to replace multiple items
05:19 - then you can just check this
05:21 - button or you can just uncheck it uh
05:24 - append fields to record if you want to
05:26 - append a column
05:29 - from the find field to the replace field
05:31 - then you can just do that as well okay
05:33 - so these are the options uh that are
05:35 - available let me just append some
05:37 - records category and the product name
05:39 - records
05:40 - and click on run
05:43 - now if you just click on this
05:48 - output anchor
05:52 - then you can see category 2 and product
05:54 - name 2 are also available over here that
05:56 - means these have been appended in the
05:58 - final
05:59 - output so that's how the find and the
06:00 - replace tool works
06:02 - now let us talk about the other tool
06:04 - that is available
06:06 - which is known as the union tool so the
06:09 - union tool is a special tool which is
06:11 - again present in the join tab
06:14 - now what is the function of this tool it
06:16 - is used to combine two or more data sets
06:18 - on the column names or the position so
06:20 - on the basis of the column names or the
06:22 - position
06:23 - it is used to combine the data sets
06:25 - right and in the output each column
06:27 - contains the row from each input
06:30 - we can
06:31 - actually perform the union operation on
06:33 - the basis of the number of the columns
06:35 - or the position the name of the columns
06:37 - or the position of the columns right so
06:39 - if we take a look at this
06:41 - we have two columns we have two data
06:44 - sets right now that is the consumer
06:46 - segment data set and the corporate
06:48 - segment data set so if we just take a
06:50 - look at these data sets they all have
06:51 - the same
06:53 - values that is the same
06:54 - columns column names are same and the
06:56 - position is also same right so we can
06:58 - just perform the union on both cases
07:01 - that is on the basis of name and on the
07:03 - basis of positions as well right
07:06 - so what we are going to do is uh we are
07:09 - just going to take both of them
07:11 - drag this union tool over here
07:13 - and we are going to connect them so this
07:15 - is one
07:18 - and this is two so we can just uh
07:21 - attach them both of them the one is the
07:24 - consumer and the second is the corporate
07:26 - now if you just check on this output tab
07:29 - what we would be getting
07:31 - is a combination of the rows that is 8
07:34 - 211 records in total
07:36 - here you can see
07:38 - right
07:39 - then we have this
07:41 - for
07:42 - cross check we have the segment column
07:44 - where first of all the consumer values
07:46 - are there
07:47 - and then if you just scroll down
07:53 - we would be having the corporate values
07:55 - okay
07:57 - so this is what we are getting over here
07:59 - um
08:01 - now if you just go to this union tool
08:03 - here we have three options auto config
08:05 - by name that means if the column names
08:07 - is similar then you can use this option
08:10 - next is auto config by position that
08:12 - means if the position is similar then
08:14 - automatic configuration would be done on
08:16 - the basis of position so we can do that
08:17 - as well because uh in our case both of
08:19 - these things are same so there would be
08:21 - no change
08:23 - right but the third option that we have
08:25 - right now is the manual configuration by
08:27 - the fields so if you want to configure
08:29 - some fields to other values that you can
08:31 - do like
08:32 - here we have state and postal code so if
08:35 - you want to just
08:36 - change them
08:38 - with this interchange them like this
08:40 - okay
08:41 - and click on run
08:44 - so now what would happen is if you just
08:46 - go there
08:49 - in the state and the postal code these
08:51 - values would be interchanged with one
08:53 - another right
08:55 - to understand it in a better way we can
08:56 - just use the browse tool over here
08:59 - so that we can get to see the individual
09:01 - records and run it
09:06 - right
09:07 - now if we just go to this tool
09:11 - here
09:13 - we can find the postal code
09:19 - right
09:20 - and as you can see the longest value is
09:23 - not carolina uh the large alphanumeric
09:25 - value is winsconsin that means the
09:28 - values have been interchanged okay
09:31 - and similarly in order to check for the
09:33 - segment
09:34 - what we can do is just select the
09:36 - segment one
09:38 - segment field over here
09:40 - here is the segment field and there are
09:41 - two values the consumer segment and the
09:43 - corporate segment so that is how the
09:44 - union works for the union to work at
09:47 - least to the of the data sets must be
09:49 - available and they must have some of the
09:51 - common ground on the basis of which you
09:54 - can perform the union operation union
09:56 - operation is similar that is one table
10:00 - is appended over the other table
10:02 - no changes are made into the individual
10:04 - records only
10:06 - uh the
10:08 - appending operation takes place so
10:10 - that's all for this union tool and
10:12 - that's all for this video in the next
10:14 - videos we would be looking at some more
10:16 - tools of this joint app that's all for
10:18 - this video thanks for watching
