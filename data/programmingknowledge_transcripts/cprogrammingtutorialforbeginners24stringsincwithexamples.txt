00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and this is John from
00:04 - programming knowledge in this video guys
00:06 - we're gonna be discussing what is
00:07 - strings in c and how we can take
00:10 - advantage of the usage of this
00:12 - particular strings and then of course
00:14 - we're gonna be dealing with the
00:16 - different functions that we could use in
00:19 - order to work with our strings in our c
00:23 - programming language now if you are new
00:26 - here in our youth with youtube channel
00:28 - and you want content about programming i
00:31 - am inviting you to subscribe and press
00:33 - the notification bell so you'll get
00:35 - updated whenever we have a new upload so
00:38 - without further ado let's dive right in
00:41 - or topic which is the strings in c
00:43 - programming so basically guys when we
00:46 - say string in c programming it is the
00:49 - one-dimensional array of characters this
00:52 - is called strings in other terms this is
00:56 - just you know a group of characters
01:00 - logically grouped together and then and
01:03 - then there should be a sense why we're
01:06 - grouping this characters together and
01:09 - this is terminated by a null character
01:12 - backslash 0 so actually guess there are
01:17 - two types of or two ways to declare
01:19 - string in c programming
01:21 - okay so we could declare it like this
01:26 - basically guys we have used the basic
01:28 - structure of our starter program so you
01:34 - know word program so i'm just going to
01:35 - delete that and we're going to
01:38 - initialize or declare string in c
01:43 - programming so you can do it like this
01:45 - you can specify the type as char or car
01:50 - and then of course the name of your
01:54 - variable so you could name it something
01:56 - like this name and then you can specify
01:59 - here the length of your array of
02:07 - characters so for example 6 and then
02:10 - here we could
02:13 - and the different characters for this
02:18 - particular string so we could say here
02:22 - for example H comma and then we're going
02:28 - to specify another character so first
02:31 - you have to specify single code and then
02:34 - the character and then single code to
02:36 - close that particular literal string and
02:40 - then another comma and then single code
02:45 - character again single code comma and
02:48 - then single code another character okay
02:55 - so you get the idea on how you could you
02:58 - know declare your string variable in c
03:04 - programming so I'm just going to
03:05 - continue working with this so we have
03:10 - declared 6 so as I've said from the
03:14 - beginning you have to order string it is
03:18 - the one-dimensional array of characters
03:20 - and it should be terminated by a null
03:22 - character so now the character in C is
03:25 - backslash 0 ok so basically now we know
03:30 - we do have the string name and then we
03:34 - need to close this one up so this is how
03:38 - we could declare our string in c
03:43 - programming language and actually case
03:46 - you could do it also like this so for
03:49 - example you don't need to specify the
03:53 - length so char and then you can say here
03:57 - last name and then all you have to do is
04:02 - declare it as an array but you don't
04:05 - have to specify the length here for
04:08 - example 5 or 6 or something like that so
04:11 - all you have to do is initialize this
04:16 - with a with an actual value for example
04:20 - Hopkins or something like this
04:25 - okay and then close it with a semicolon
04:28 - so basically guys it means the same
04:31 - thing if we declare the string like this
04:33 - or if you want to declare the string
04:37 - like this and of course you can try to
04:42 - display this all we have to do is print
04:46 - and print F and then we can say here the
04:52 - name is and then we need to add the
04:57 - format specifiers or percent s for a
05:00 - string and then the newline specifier in
05:04 - the comma and then the actual value or
05:07 - string or the variable that we want to
05:09 - display which is the name something like
05:12 - this and then semicolon and we could
05:16 - also do the same for the last name so
05:18 - printf and then open and close
05:20 - parenthesis the last name is percent
05:26 - again percent as the format specifier
05:29 - for string and then new line and comma
05:35 - then the actual variable which is
05:38 - lasting so we could try this add this
05:41 - the the simply colon at the end of the
05:44 - line that denotes that this is the end
05:47 - of this particular line okay so make
05:50 - sure you do that because the compiler
05:52 - won't complain if you do not specify the
05:56 - end of a certain line so now we could
06:00 - build and run our program and it should
06:03 - display your string like this
06:06 - the name is hello as we have specified
06:10 - in our variable name and then the last
06:14 - name is Hopkins as you can see here okay
06:18 - so that's a good start
06:20 - on how we could start working with our
06:23 - string in C programming language now
06:27 - there are functions as I've said there
06:29 - are functions that we could use if we
06:32 - want to work with our string more so the
06:37 - first sample what
06:39 - if you want to copy a string concatenate
06:43 - the string get the length of the string
06:46 - so we could do that we can also compare
06:50 - strings if you if you like to compare
06:52 - strings so all we have to do guys we
06:55 - need to include a header file which is
07:00 - string that H so this header file
07:06 - contains all the functions that we need
07:09 - if you we want to work with string in
07:14 - you know deeper sense so string and then
07:21 - H as I've said this will contain all the
07:24 - functions that we need like for example
07:27 - the STR copy STR concatenate this TR
07:31 - land or if you want to get the length of
07:35 - a certain variable so for now let's just
07:38 - try this this is for display display the
07:44 - value of our string right and then of
07:48 - course here we could use functions to
07:55 - our string okay so perhaps the first
08:00 - function that we could use is the STR
08:03 - copy so the key word for that is STR STR
08:09 - and then C B Y so as you can see here we
08:14 - have the other suggestions the STR copy
08:18 - right here so we could click on that and
08:21 - then in here we could specify the string
08:25 - so let me explain first what this means
08:30 - so the STR copy function takes in two
08:34 - parameters so the first one will be the
08:37 - destination or the string that the copy
08:44 - of a value will be stored in and then
08:46 - the second function I mean the second
08:49 - argument will be the source of
08:53 - or I mean the source string okay so
08:56 - again it will take two parameter this
09:00 - strcpy the first parameter will be the
09:04 - destination string the second parameter
09:07 - will be the source string okay so for
09:12 - example in this program I'm going to
09:16 - declare another string here and then we
09:20 - can say here STR and then full-name for
09:30 - example this is just for a sake for the
09:32 - sake of example okay so for example this
09:37 - will be maybe I don't know maybe
09:45 - thirteen okay so we don't set a value
09:50 - for this for now and all we have to do
09:53 - is use our STR copy function and then we
09:58 - need to specify the destination string
10:02 - so for now let's use this as The Artful
10:05 - name as the destination string right
10:08 - there and then comma and then of course
10:12 - we need to specify the source string
10:15 - okay and then the source string will be
10:23 - maybe the last name okay now if we want
10:32 - to display the value of set or STR full
10:36 - name then we could use the printf
10:39 - statement and then we could say here the
10:43 - full name s and then percent s again
10:48 - backslash n for the newline and comma
10:53 - for the actual value as they are full
10:58 - name right there and then and this up
11:03 - with a semicolon
11:04 - okay and then we could clean up
11:06 - this just to see the result of our
11:09 - program and in here we have an error
11:16 - okay so we copied the actual value of
11:20 - our variable instead of using last name
11:25 - so let's just modify this so instead of
11:32 - Hopkins it should be last name here okay
11:37 - so clean and build our program and it
11:40 - should be okay for now and as you can
11:42 - see here we have the display so the last
11:46 - name or the name is hello as I can see
11:49 - and then the last name is Hopkins and
11:53 - the full name is Hopkins and these two
11:57 - is identical that's because we already
12:00 - we just copied the value of last name
12:04 - and assign the value to the STR full
12:09 - name okay so that's how easy for us to
12:11 - copy strings inside our C program so
12:14 - there are there are other functions as
12:16 - well if you want to explore more about
12:19 - this so for example the other function
12:22 - that we could use is STR say 80 or C STR
12:29 - cut so this will concatenate the string
12:34 - or to string so basically it will just
12:37 - take two parameters the the first one
12:42 - and the second parameter and then it
12:45 - should you know combine this to string
12:47 - two two to form a new string so let me
12:51 - show you that so let's just use this STR
12:55 - cut and then maybe we'll just use the
12:59 - name and then the last name so the first
13:03 - string will be name okay and comma and
13:07 - then we need to specify also D what they
13:12 - call this the string
13:19 - for the second string which is the SDR
13:22 - full name okay and then semicolon
13:31 - okay and then after this we could
13:36 - display the value of our name so we have
13:41 - to do now is copy this and paste it this
13:45 - here and let's clean up build our
13:49 - program so first now let's just close
13:55 - this close the output the output first
13:59 - and then clean and build our program and
14:04 - it should display here what we have done
14:08 - so far so the name is hello the last
14:11 - name is hopkins the full name is hopkins
14:14 - and as you can see here the name is
14:17 - hello hopkins so as you can see it
14:21 - concatenated the name and then the last
14:25 - name so the name got the value of hello
14:28 - and then the last name got the value of
14:30 - hopkins okay so i think that's all there
14:34 - is to it for this tutorial and if you
14:36 - want to learn more about strings all the
14:38 - functions you could explore the
14:42 - documentation so if you want to know
14:45 - more about the different functions
14:49 - available in this string that h header
14:55 - file you can visit this website and then
15:00 - you can see here the commonly used
15:04 - string functions so we already have use
15:10 - the STR CP y-str cat and of course the
15:17 - other most common you commonly used
15:20 - string function is getting the length of
15:23 - your string okay
15:25 - so again this is all about this tutorial
15:27 - and if you have questions you can ask
15:29 - questions below in the comment section
15:32 - and again thank you for watching and see
15:34 - you in the next video
