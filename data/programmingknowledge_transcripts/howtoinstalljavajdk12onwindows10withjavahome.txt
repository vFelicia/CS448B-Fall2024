00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - java jdk on your Windows 10 operating
00:07 - system so let's get started so first of
00:10 - all we are going to check whether Java
00:12 - is already installed on our system or
00:14 - not so just right-click on your windows
00:18 - icon here and then click on command
00:20 - prompt and here you just need to type a
00:22 - simple command which is Java C command
00:26 - so if this Java C command is going to
00:30 - give you this kind of response which
00:32 - says Java C is not recognized as an
00:35 - internal or external command then most
00:38 - probably Java JDK is not not installed
00:41 - on your Windows 10 operating system so
00:45 - we are going to install it so first of
00:47 - all open your favorite browser and
00:49 - search for Java JDK now you will see
00:54 - different versions of Java JDK is in the
00:57 - search results so right now I am seeing
01:00 - Java SE development kit 8 which is most
01:03 - popular right now but when I scroll down
01:06 - I can also see Java SE development kit
01:10 - 12 so this is the latest version of Java
01:15 - JDK at the time of making this video so
01:18 - I'm going to show you how you can
01:19 - download and install Java SE development
01:23 - kit 12 so I'm going to click on this
01:26 - link and you will see this oracle.com
01:29 - website will open and you will see first
01:33 - of all this agreement so I am going to
01:36 - just say I accept all cookies and now
01:39 - you can see this version on this webpage
01:43 - again which is Java SE development kit
01:46 - 12 downloads so first of all you just
01:50 - need to scroll down and then click on
01:53 - the accept License Agreement radio
01:57 - button and then depending upon your
01:59 - operating system you can choose the
02:02 - binaries or the executable file so right
02:05 - now we are on Windows 10 so we are going
02:07 - to choose the second last option which
02:10 - says JDK 12 windows
02:13 - - x64 underscore bin dot exe file so we
02:19 - are going to download this Exe file and
02:21 - this Exe file is about 159 megabyte so
02:27 - you just need to wait for some time to
02:28 - download this Exe file so once this
02:32 - executable file is downloaded you just
02:34 - need to click on this executable file
02:36 - and then I'm going to minimize the
02:38 - browser and first of all you will see
02:40 - this kind of warning I'm going to just
02:42 - click on yes and now the installation
02:45 - wizard has been started so I'm going to
02:47 - just click on next and then if you don't
02:51 - have the good reason to change the
02:54 - location where this Java JDK will be
02:58 - installed on your operating system just
03:00 - leave everything as default so this will
03:02 - be the location where your Java
03:05 - development kit will be installed so we
03:08 - are going to go to this location after
03:10 - installing Java JDK for now I'm going to
03:13 - just click on the next button which is
03:15 - going to start the installation of Java
03:18 - development kit so just wait for some
03:20 - time until this progress bar reaches to
03:23 - the hundred percent mark and after a few
03:26 - seconds you will see this message which
03:28 - says Java development kit is
03:30 - successfully installed so you can just
03:32 - close this window and now we are going
03:34 - to go to the location where this Java
03:37 - development kit is installed so go to
03:39 - your C Drive and here go to Program
03:43 - Files and you will be able to see this
03:46 - new Java folder which is created by this
03:49 - Installer for you so I'm going to click
03:52 - inside this and you can see this folder
03:55 - which is JDK folder so now we are going
03:58 - to just set up our environment variables
04:02 - so our command prompt is going to
04:04 - recognize the java c command or any
04:06 - other java related command so what you
04:09 - need to do is you just need to go inside
04:11 - this bin folder and then copy this part
04:15 - from here and then right click on your
04:18 - windows icon once again and then click
04:21 - on system and once this system window is
04:24 - open just click on advanced system
04:26 - settings
04:27 - and then environment variables and here
04:32 - you can see two kind of environment
04:34 - variables one is user variables for the
04:38 - user and other is the system variables
04:41 - so we are going to create the system
04:43 - variables so first of all just click on
04:46 - this path system variable so here on the
04:50 - left hand side you will be able to see
04:51 - path so just double click on it or just
04:55 - click on the edit button and then you
04:58 - can just click on new and then paste
05:00 - this part until bin folder which you
05:04 - have copied so once you are finished
05:06 - with this environment variable then
05:09 - click on OK and now we are going to
05:12 - create a new environment variable which
05:14 - is called Java home environment variable
05:16 - which is required by some IDE s and
05:20 - other Java related programs to recognize
05:25 - your java jdk directory so here we are
05:30 - going to just click on new and then we
05:34 - are going to create a Java home variable
05:36 - so just type Java underscore home all in
05:39 - capital and then here as the variable
05:43 - value we are going to go to the folder
05:45 - once again where we have our Java JDK
05:49 - folder so this time just go to this
05:52 - folder under Java folder which is the
05:54 - JDK folder and then you don't need to go
05:58 - inside the bin folder now you just need
06:00 - to go until the JDK folder so just copy
06:04 - this part and then paste this path as
06:07 - the variable value for the Java
06:10 - underscore home environment variable so
06:12 - I'm going to just click on OK and you
06:15 - can see this new environment variable is
06:18 - created here so now once you are done
06:19 - with the setting of the environment
06:21 - variables we are going to just click OK
06:23 - and then ok and I'm going to close this
06:26 - system window so now Java is installed
06:29 - on your Windows operating system and we
06:32 - are going to check once again if it
06:34 - works or not so once again right click
06:36 - on the windows icon and then
06:39 - again open your command prompt and once
06:42 - again we are going to give this command
06:43 - Java C and first of all let's see the
06:47 - version so I'm going to just say Java C
06:49 - - version and then press Enter which is
06:53 - going to give me the version of Java C
06:56 - which is installed on my system which is
06:59 - at this time Java C twelve point zero
07:02 - point two because we have installed Java
07:04 - JDK twelve on our Windows operating
07:06 - system also if you want to know the Java
07:10 - version you just need to type Java - -
07:15 - version and then press Enter
07:17 - which is going to give you the version
07:19 - of Java installed on your system also
07:21 - once you have installed this Java JDK
07:23 - the Java SE runtime environment will be
07:27 - automatically installed so you don't
07:29 - need to do anything extra for this and
07:32 - here is the Java hotspot 64-bit server
07:36 - virtual machine so if you see this kind
07:38 - of result that means Java is
07:41 - successfully installed on your Windows
07:43 - operating system and if you want to
07:45 - compile any Java file using command line
07:49 - you can always give this Java C command
07:52 - which is for compiling your the Java
07:55 - program so Java C and the name of the
07:58 - file but let's say I just typed Java C
08:01 - and then press entered it's going to
08:03 - give me so many options here and you
08:07 - will see this usage warning here and it
08:12 - says you need to use this Java C command
08:15 - with some options and the source file
08:18 - that's why it's giving me all this help
08:22 - how can I use this Java C command in
08:25 - order to compile my Java projects so
08:30 - this is how you can download and install
08:33 - Java JDK on your Windows 10 operating
08:36 - system I hope you've enjoyed this video
08:38 - and I will see you in the next video
