00:00 - hello guys in the previous video we have
00:02 - created the sound effects for our game
00:05 - and in this video we are going to create
00:07 - a high score system for our game we are
00:09 - going to use uh unity's player flash for
00:12 - this
00:12 - it is an easy way to store the data on
00:15 - our device locally
00:17 - so
00:18 - we will first of all create the ui for
00:20 - high score so
00:22 - let's go into the main menu
00:24 - and expand this canvas object and in
00:27 - here
00:28 - duplicate this title text and we will
00:30 - rename it to high score
00:32 - so let's say name it
00:35 - now
00:36 - after that we will also reposition it to
00:39 - the bottom of the screen
00:42 - somewhere around here
00:45 - let's change the text
00:47 - to high score
00:53 - click on this best fit
00:56 - and let's also resize the text area
01:01 - to make it in one line
01:05 - and after that let's go into the main
01:07 - manuscript to
01:09 - reference this high score text
01:12 - create a variable public
01:15 - text
01:17 - i score txt
01:23 - and
01:23 - after that save the script
01:26 - and
01:27 - let's go back into the unity
01:31 - and
01:32 - wait for it to compile
01:35 - and after that click on the canvas and
01:37 - drag and drop the high score into the
01:39 - high score txt period
01:42 - and now
01:44 - let's go into the game manager script
01:46 - and here when we are setting the score
01:50 - we will say player press
01:53 - dot set int
01:55 - you can also set float and
01:57 - string
01:58 - we will give it a string which is
02:01 - a key
02:02 - to access this which is high score and
02:06 - we will set it to the current score
02:10 - and this score is currently float so
02:13 - let's type cast it to integer
02:18 - now we want to
02:20 - change the high score only if this score
02:23 - is less than
02:24 - the high score
02:26 - so let's say if
02:28 - our score
02:30 - is
02:31 - less than
02:32 - i'm sorry it is greater than
02:35 - player press
02:36 - dot
02:37 - get it
02:39 - and we will get this particular key
02:41 - which we have created
02:43 - which is high score
02:46 - and we will also pass in the default
02:49 - value as 0
02:50 - so
02:51 - whenever our score is greater than the
02:54 - previous high score it will reset
02:57 - the
02:58 - high score key
03:00 - to that score
03:02 - now save this script
03:06 - and
03:07 - in the main menu script
03:10 - we will say that i score text
03:14 - dot text
03:16 - is equals to
03:19 - is equals to player preps
03:22 - so
03:24 - let's say player preps
03:27 - dot
03:28 - get integer
03:30 - and we will
03:32 - get that key which we have created which
03:35 - is high score
03:37 - and we will also pass in the default
03:39 - value
03:40 - as 0
03:41 - and we also need to convert this into a
03:44 - string so let's
03:47 - say tostring
03:49 - [Music]
03:50 - okay
03:53 - so
03:54 - [Music]
03:55 - now in the
03:58 - game manager script
03:59 - we have to also type cast the score to
04:02 - integer because it is currently float
04:05 - [Music]
04:08 - okay
04:11 - so save the script and go back to the
04:13 - unity
04:18 - and
04:19 - let's play the game
04:26 - we can see that our high score is 0
04:29 - but we want to also display the high
04:31 - score
04:32 - in front of the actual high score
04:35 - let me simplify it
04:37 - so we will
04:39 - add a
04:40 - high score
04:44 - string
04:45 - in front of the
04:47 - actual high score
04:51 - okay
04:52 - so
04:54 - that's it let's save it
04:56 - [Music]
04:57 - and go back to the unity
05:00 - now let's play the game
05:03 - now
05:05 - you can see that it is currently
05:06 - displaying high score as zero let's play
05:08 - the game
05:13 - so
05:14 - it is displaying two as a high score
05:18 - let's try to score
05:22 - okay let's try again
05:26 - okay so now it is
05:28 - 4 so it will display s4
05:32 - and you can
05:35 - reset the layer press by going into the
05:38 - edit and
05:39 - clear all player player brackets and
05:42 - click on yes to delete all the
05:44 - player flaps
05:46 - and it will reset the
05:48 - data in the
05:50 - player tracks
05:53 - okay so that was it for this video
05:56 - thank you for watching this video
