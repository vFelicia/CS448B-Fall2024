00:00 - hey guys welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge
00:03 - these are that tutorial let's start so
00:07 - before starting first let us discuss
00:09 - what we have seen overall till now we
00:12 - have seen what is Kivi we have seen why
00:13 - Kiwi is used how Kiwi is used and that
00:15 - Vantage's of losing TV over other
00:18 - languages then we saw the setup of Kiwi
00:21 - in the second tutorial followed by we
00:23 - saw how we are opening an app it code
00:25 - explanation and the displaying of text
00:28 - with code explanation and then we have
00:30 - seen creating a button with code
00:31 - explanation so in the last tutorial we
00:34 - ended creating a button which is or full
00:37 - which is of full page now we see how we
00:40 - are going to alter the button in a
00:42 - smaller format so for for doing that we
00:47 - are going to set the button properties
00:49 - in the method for the code now what is
00:53 - the button properties we require we
00:55 - require the position of the button and
00:56 - size of the button for position of the
00:58 - button we use pause which is position
01:01 - POS equals to value comma value these
01:05 - are X and y-axis we define the method
01:07 - which is post equals to value comma
01:09 - value then we use for size of the button
01:12 - size underscore hand followed by the two
01:15 - values which is value comma value which
01:18 - we are going to define in the method let
01:20 - us know go and run this by applying in
01:24 - the code
01:29 - No first I will import the following
01:33 - button and there it is from TV door
01:42 - import then from TV door UI X dot button
01:56 - button no I'm going to kill the class
02:03 - then I'm going to use the app which I
02:07 - have imported now I'm going to open the
02:12 - class file and define the method by D
02:14 - FBI LD and self key word now a skater
02:21 - the class key to the third define the
02:24 - method now I'm going to create the
02:26 - variable called BTN in which I'm going
02:28 - to show the button which I'm going to
02:30 - create right now is button Android the
02:33 - text which is equals to push me under
02:39 - the course No
02:41 - as discussed I'm going to use here the
02:45 - size and the pause which is size and of
02:48 - coherent is the button size and POS is
02:51 - the position of the button no comma size
02:56 - underscore hint here I'm giving equals
03:04 - to and embroidering the point 2 comma
03:09 - point 2 which is the size of the pattern
03:11 - and ps2 open the bracket I'm going to
03:18 - provide let us say 300 comma 250 it will
03:22 - be coming somewhere around here as I
03:25 - have defined three hundred combo 250 so
03:29 - if I'm going to provide some other
03:31 - values according to those values button
03:34 - will be created let's see if I am going
03:36 - one two or like any other values higher
03:39 - button size will be higher
03:41 - I do have given point to come upon - so
03:44 - the button will be smaller and the
03:46 - position accordingly of the screen so
03:48 - 300 turn 250 means it will be coming
03:50 - somewhere around here okay
03:54 - no coming back to the code I'm going to
03:57 - return the button which is by using
03:59 - return to make sure the button is
04:03 - displayed so I am going to use the
04:05 - return it unbuttoned okay no let's run
04:10 - the code by providing it in the main
04:14 - method which is if underscore underscore
04:16 - name underscore underscore equals 2
04:20 - equals 2 inside the first two feely and
04:23 - let's go and ESCO main underscore
04:26 - underscore and I'm going to open the
04:30 - main method now let's run the button app
04:33 - by calling button and bracket don't run
04:43 - so let's know run the court what is the
04:48 - expected output
04:49 - he's like button will be coming over
04:51 - here with the size Oh point 2 comma
04:53 - point 2 which is the length and the
04:55 - bread and the position of the button
04:58 - will be coming in 300 comma 250 size of
05:01 - the screen
05:01 - let's now on the court so here we go as
05:08 - expected the button is created with the
05:11 - size of point 2 comma point 2 along with
05:13 - the 300 comma 250 which is over here if
05:17 - I'm going to provide some other values
05:19 - for the size underscore it hint and the
05:22 - position so it will be coming like as
05:26 - you are providing the size no let's go
05:33 - back and understand the code how it
05:35 - worked
05:39 - as you can see where if like
05:44 - I'm running the button app dot run it's
05:47 - coming on here and it will be coming
05:50 - under the definition method and it's
05:53 - taking the push me which we saw the push
05:55 - me text and the size underscore hint
05:57 - followed by the position this is how the
06:00 - alterations of button are done in the
06:02 - last tutorial we created the button
06:04 - which was in the full screen so you can
06:07 - go back and take a look at the tutorial
06:10 - number two in which I have created the
06:13 - button so this is how it's going to run
06:15 - so we have altered the button using this
06:19 - code the coming tutorials will be seeing
06:22 - other parts of the library thank you for
06:24 - joining with programming knowledge
