00:01 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can create your first C++
00:06 - hello world program using
00:09 - xcode so let's get started and let's see
00:11 - how we can create our first C++ project
00:15 - using xcode and then I'm going to show
00:17 - you how you can compile and run your C++
00:21 - project so first of all open your xcode
00:26 - and then we are going to create a new
00:28 - xcode project so click on this option
00:30 - which says create a new xcode project
00:34 - which is going to open this kind of
00:36 - interface to you now on the top when you
00:40 - see you will be able to see iOS and
00:43 - watch OS TV OS Mac OS so what we want is
00:49 - we want to open this tab which is for
00:53 - Mac OS so just select Mac OS from the
00:57 - top here and then you will be able to
00:59 - see see these options here now for C++
01:03 - we are going to create a command line uh
01:07 - tool or command line program so you need
01:11 - to select this option which says command
01:13 - line tool okay so Mac OS and then select
01:17 - command line tool and then click
01:20 - next and now you just need to give the
01:23 - name for for your project so uh for
01:27 - example I'm creating uh hello World
01:30 - project so I'm going to name my project
01:32 - as hello world and then uh you don't
01:36 - have any team right now so I'm going to
01:38 - leave it it as default and organization
01:42 - name also I'm going to leave it as
01:44 - default and now at the bottom you will
01:47 - be able to see the language so this is
01:50 - important step you just need to select
01:52 - C++ here okay so because we are creating
01:56 - a C++ program so we need to select C++
01:59 - here here and now we need to give the
02:02 - organization identifier so just hover
02:04 - over the organization identifier and you
02:08 - can see uh what this means so this means
02:11 - your organizations
02:13 - bundled uh identifier prefix I think so
02:17 - for for now I'm just giving CPP here you
02:20 - can give anything uh any name here as a
02:24 - prefix for now I'm just giving CPP okay
02:28 - you can give any uh identify here as you
02:31 - wish now I'm going to click
02:34 - next and now you just need to give the
02:38 - directory in which you want to save your
02:41 - project so you can uh create a new
02:44 - directory for this or you can uh just
02:48 - save it wherever you want so for example
02:50 - I want to uh save this project on the
02:53 - desktop and I'm going to create a new
02:55 - folder here and I'm going to name my
02:58 - folder as CP P okay and then I'm going
03:01 - to create this uh directory and then
03:04 - select this directory and then just
03:07 - click
03:07 - create and this is going to be saved in
03:11 - my desktop on C++ or CPP directory okay
03:16 - now uh I can see this warning which is
03:20 - not very important but uh anyway this
03:24 - says xcode would like to access your
03:26 - context and I will just say don't allow
03:30 - for now and then I will just say okay
03:36 - okay and now uh this project hello world
03:39 - is created for me and in this hello
03:42 - world project there is a folder called
03:45 - hello world which we have created which
03:47 - is the name of our project and then
03:50 - there is one uh main.cpp file so I'm
03:53 - going to just double click on this
03:56 - main.cpp and you can see there there is
04:00 - some program here so I can just close it
04:04 - for now and you can see uh it's there
04:08 - also the same program is there also so
04:10 - when you double click on the cpb file
04:13 - it's going to open in the another Tab
04:17 - and if you single click on this main.
04:21 - CPP is going to show you this uh file
04:25 - inside your xcode editor right now here
04:30 - uh xcode is uh intelligent enough and
04:34 - it's going to um create a sample hello
04:37 - world program for you right so I'm going
04:40 - to explain what this code is so the
04:44 - first line of code or whenever you see
04:47 - this line of code these are the commands
04:50 - here so whatever which start with double
04:53 - forward slash is the commment and this
04:56 - is not the part of uh the code it's the
04:59 - it it's just for some information giving
05:02 - some information about the code right so
05:06 - you can even ignore these comments for
05:09 - now or you can uh give these comments uh
05:13 - it's on you right so comments are just
05:16 - the way to provide the information about
05:19 - your code now the first line here is to
05:23 - include iostream Library which is a
05:26 - built-in Library which is used to uh you
05:30 - know provide you these method for
05:33 - example this namespace STD and uh for
05:37 - example this see out uh method inside
05:40 - STD right so if you remove this uh
05:44 - Library include then this code will not
05:48 - work right now this is the main entry
05:52 - point for your uh C++ program so the
05:56 - main method so here you see int Main and
06:01 - then in the brackets some argument for
06:04 - the main for now for printing hello
06:07 - world you don't even need this but uh
06:10 - excode will uh you know provide you the
06:13 - proper implementation of uh main method
06:15 - so you I will leave it as default but
06:19 - main method is the main entry point for
06:21 - your code right and then STD colon colon
06:25 - see out is used to print some uh text so
06:31 - after STD uh see out uh you just give
06:35 - these angle bracket double angle
06:38 - brackets uh towards uh the text and then
06:42 - you can just write uh whatever you want
06:45 - to print so for example once again I
06:48 - just want to print hello world so I will
06:50 - just uh fix this hello world I will
06:52 - remove the comma and then just save the
06:55 - code and once you are done with the code
06:58 - you need to comp compile your code okay
07:01 - so how you can compile your code so to
07:04 - compile your code you just need to uh go
07:06 - to the product uh tab here and then you
07:11 - can see the build option here so you can
07:14 - just click this option which says build
07:16 - and then it's going to build your
07:18 - program and to run it once again go to
07:21 - product and then click on the run and
07:25 - when you click run then it's going to
07:28 - once again build the program and then
07:30 - print the output on this console here
07:33 - which is hello world right now there is
07:36 - another option to run your code and this
07:39 - option is this one which is like a
07:42 - triangle here triangle icon you can just
07:45 - uh click it and it's going to build your
07:47 - program and it's going to run your
07:50 - program and show the output once again
07:53 - right you can just modify uh this hello
07:57 - words so for example this is my first
08:02 - CPP project right and then I'm going to
08:06 - save this and then I'm going to build
08:09 - this program and now it's going to print
08:13 - the same text which I have written there
08:15 - so you can see the same text is printed
08:19 - so in this way you can create your first
08:21 - C++ project on xcode I hope you have
08:25 - enjoyed this video please wrate comment
08:27 - and subscribe and bye for now
