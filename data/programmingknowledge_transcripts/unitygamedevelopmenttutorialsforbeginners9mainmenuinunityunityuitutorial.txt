00:00 - hello guys so in this video we are going
00:02 - to create a main menu for our game
00:05 - in the previous video we have created
00:07 - this
00:08 - pause menu
00:09 - so that whenever we click on this pause
00:12 - button
00:13 - our game will be paused and we can
00:15 - resume or quit
00:17 - now we will create a main menu
00:19 - so that whenever we start the game
00:22 - the main menu will be shown first
00:25 - and then we can choose
00:27 - to play the game or quit
00:29 - currently we will implement only two
00:31 - functionalities
00:33 - with and play
00:35 - but later on we can
00:36 - add high score and options
00:39 - so to create a main menu we have to
00:42 - create a new scene
00:44 - currently we have this sample scene you
00:46 - can also rename this to label or game
00:48 - whatever you want but we will create a
00:51 - new scene
00:53 - so let's create a new
00:55 - scene
00:59 - and we will name it as main
01:03 - menu
01:06 - now double click on it to open
01:11 - now we want to change the background
01:13 - color of this main menu
01:15 - so click on this background
01:18 - property
01:20 - and change it to
01:22 - something white
01:24 - you can make it
01:26 - like whatever you want
01:30 - we will also create a
01:32 - button here
01:34 - so let's go into the ui and then button
01:38 - it will automatically create the canvas
01:40 - and event system
01:42 - we have already talked about these two
01:46 - so we will choose
01:48 - screen space camera as our render mode
01:51 - and we will drag and drop our main
01:53 - camera
01:56 - and here we will click on this pixel
01:58 - perfect
02:00 - so for the
02:01 - ui scale mode we will go with scale with
02:05 - screen size so it will scale our canvas
02:08 - according to the
02:09 - screen resolution
02:12 - so we have to provide this reference
02:14 - resolution so let's say
02:17 - 1920 by 1080 then
02:19 - because we are in
02:21 - portrait mode then we have to give
02:23 - 1080 by 1920
02:27 - and here
02:29 - we will say
02:30 - 0.5
02:35 - now we will rename this button to play
02:39 - so let's rename it to play
02:45 - we will make it
02:47 - little bit bigger
02:51 - let's go with 300 by
03:02 - let's go with 400 by
03:07 - 200 okay
03:09 - now we will also change the text on the
03:11 - button
03:12 - so let's make it
03:14 - display
03:16 - we will choose the font style as a bold
03:20 - and
03:22 - let's increase the
03:25 - font size
03:27 - we can
03:28 - make it 200 and we can also click on
03:31 - this best fit
03:33 - so it will
03:35 - fit our text according to the size of
03:38 - this button
03:41 - now
03:42 - it is already centered
03:45 - we will also
03:47 - change its color
03:49 - if you want
03:50 - but
03:51 - let's change it to completely black
03:55 - now we will also
03:57 - give it a
03:59 - shadow
04:02 - and
04:06 - let's adjust this effect distance
04:16 - now you can also change the
04:18 - effect color of the shadow but
04:22 - this looks quite well
04:25 - now we will
04:26 - also give the shadow to
04:30 - our
04:31 - button
04:33 - and
04:36 - change the factory distance
04:44 - okay so now we will also reposition our
04:48 - button
04:50 - let's click on the button and
04:54 - okay so let's
04:56 - click on this move tool
04:58 - and drag it
05:00 - little bit upward
05:04 - okay this is good
05:06 - now we will duplicate this button
05:09 - so let's press ctrl d
05:12 - and we will rename this to quit
05:18 - and we will also change the
05:22 - text on the button
05:25 - quit
05:29 - and
05:30 - let's reposition it
05:33 - okay so we have only selected the text
05:36 - you have to select this whole quit
05:37 - button
05:44 - okay so if you want to give a title to
05:47 - our game then
05:48 - we need to
05:50 - hold
05:51 - display and quit button slightly below
05:55 - so let's
05:56 - select them
05:58 - by holding shift
06:01 - and we will drag them
06:03 - downwards
06:08 - we can add the title if we want and we
06:11 - can also add
06:12 - high score
06:14 - now
06:16 - we will make this quit button
06:18 - little bit smaller
06:22 - okay
06:24 - so it's looking
06:26 - quite good
06:27 - now you can also
06:29 - add a title by just
06:31 - right clicking on canvas and
06:33 - adding a single text element
06:36 - so we will call it as
06:39 - our
06:42 - first game
06:46 - or you can call it whatever you want
06:49 - and
06:52 - will increase its size it is currently
06:55 - not visible because the text box is
06:58 - quite small
07:01 - let's click on this
07:02 - wrapped tool
07:04 - and we can
07:06 - expand this
07:09 - and
07:10 - we will also
07:12 - reposition our
07:15 - title
07:19 - so now
07:20 - click on this text and
07:22 - we will and i align it to center both
07:25 - horizontally and vertically
07:28 - now you can see that
07:30 - it's looking quite good
07:32 - we can also change its color
07:36 - let's click on this best fit
07:38 - i can also
07:40 - change its color
07:43 - then we can also give it a shadow
07:49 - like this
07:56 - you can also increase the font size
08:04 - okay
08:05 - let's
08:06 - name it as endless runner
08:14 - okay
08:16 - that is good
08:18 - now that we have created the
08:20 - main ui of our main menu
08:24 - then we can
08:26 - save it
08:27 - and we have to also add this main menu
08:30 - scene to our build settings click on
08:33 - build settings
08:34 - and drag and drop this
08:36 - main menu
08:37 - to our
08:39 - build setting
08:41 - this scene
08:42 - list
08:44 - so now we can create a main menu script
08:48 - so click on the script folder right
08:50 - click
08:51 - create a new sheet sharp script and call
08:54 - it as main
08:57 - menu
09:01 - double click on it to open it up
09:03 - individual studio
09:06 - now we are going to use unity's ui
09:10 - so using add this namespace using unity
09:13 - engine
09:16 - dot ui
09:23 - okay so
09:24 - we can
09:25 - we are all we are also going to use the
09:29 - scene management so let's
09:32 - include that as well
09:34 - unity engine dot scene management
09:39 - in fact we are
09:41 - uh we will not
09:42 - be using this
09:44 - ui
09:45 - unity engine dot ui name space
09:48 - but we we are going to use this unity
09:51 - engine dot scene management
09:53 - so
09:55 - let's create some functions for our
09:57 - buttons
09:59 - let's create a public
10:03 - white
10:05 - play
10:07 - game
10:13 - and here we can say
10:15 - scene manager
10:19 - dot load scene
10:23 - and here we can pass in the name of our
10:26 - scene
10:27 - so
10:29 - in this
10:31 - we have to copy the scene name
10:37 - click on this sample scene click on f2
10:40 - control c
10:42 - and then we can paste this
10:44 - scene name here
10:46 - you can also rename this sample scene to
10:50 - label or something like that
10:54 - and for the quit button which is quite
10:56 - simple
10:59 - public
11:00 - let's just copy it from our
11:03 - game manager script
11:05 - we have already created this
11:07 - quit button functionality here
11:10 - so let's copy it
11:17 - okay
11:20 - now we have created the main manuscript
11:24 - so let's get back to the
11:26 - unity and
11:29 - we can assign this main manuscript to
11:32 - our canvas
11:33 - so let's assign it
11:36 - now click on this
11:38 - button
11:40 - ctrl press ctrl and you can select both
11:43 - of them at the same time
11:45 - and we will add this on click
11:48 - event
11:49 - and
11:50 - drag and drop the canvas
11:53 - so for the play button we will choose
11:57 - the
11:58 - play function play game function
12:01 - and for the
12:02 - quit button
12:04 - we will choose
12:05 - quit but quit game function
12:08 - now our
12:10 - setup is ready so we can hit play
12:16 - the squid button will not work
12:19 - in the editor but once we export our
12:21 - game to android it will beat our game
12:23 - whenever we click on this
12:26 - let's click on play
12:33 - now we have to also
12:35 - assign our
12:37 - main menu
12:38 - a main menu button a function
12:41 - that can
12:43 - redirect us to main menu whenever we
12:47 - lose the game
12:48 - so let's add that functionality also
12:53 - let's get back to the game manager
12:55 - script
12:56 - and
12:58 - here we will create a new function
13:02 - so let's create a public
13:05 - void
13:08 - name
13:12 - menu
13:17 - and here we will say scene manager
13:23 - dot load scene
13:26 - and
13:27 - we will give it
13:29 - the name of our
13:31 - main menu scene
13:33 - which is
13:34 - main menu
13:36 - you have to type in the correct name
13:38 - otherwise it will not work
13:41 - so let's copy it from here
13:47 - paste it
13:50 - okay so it is
13:52 - done
13:53 - now save this script and go back to the
13:55 - unity
13:57 - and now we can
14:00 - go to the sample scene
14:03 - and
14:04 - in the pause menu
14:06 - we have
14:08 - a
14:10 - resume and quit button but in the game
14:12 - over panel we have this main button so
14:16 - let's add a on click event
14:19 - and
14:20 - drag and drop the game manager game
14:22 - object
14:24 - and select
14:25 - main menu
14:26 - function
14:28 - and it is done
14:30 - so now let's hit play
14:33 - and
14:35 - we can see that
14:38 - we can now
14:40 - go back to the main menu and we can play
14:43 - our game
14:46 - so
14:48 - that was it for this video
14:50 - thank you for watching
