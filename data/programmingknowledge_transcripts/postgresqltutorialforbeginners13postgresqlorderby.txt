00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:05 - you can use order by Clause in your
00:07 - Sigma case so first open your terminal
00:19 - right psql now let us see which other
00:25 - databases present in our system so we
00:28 - are going to use test database
00:34 - open it and and this is the table we
00:39 - have student table and it has roll
00:45 - number and name so let us see so now
01:00 - what I say is of order by clause from
01:03 - the name suggests itself whatever
01:06 - clothes is used to order your result in
01:10 - ascending or descending order so how to
01:14 - write it in order by then the name of
01:24 - the column by which you want to order
01:25 - the result let's say name
01:28 - I own the result to be ordered by name
01:32 - and you can sing region come first then
01:36 - him on EDD it is in alphabetical order
01:39 - so by default when you didn't provide
01:43 - any ascending or descending keyboard it
01:49 - will order the result ascending order if
01:55 - you want it to descending order you can
01:59 - write P click you
02:05 - and you can see now it is in descending
02:08 - order in alphabetical you can also order
02:13 - it by the roll number here you can see
02:20 - this is innocent
02:23 - so that means is waiting and okay so let
02:41 - me first create a new table this time
02:45 - create table
02:47 - let's same way it has employee ID and
02:59 - the data type in vain name name of
03:06 - employee welfare of 10 and EMP ID will
03:16 - be a primary key
04:32 - so we have these three levels so I want
04:36 - to order it buzzy employee thing I write
04:41 - order by and you can see it is in
04:48 - ascending if I provide keyboard DSC then
04:53 - it will be descending we can also order
04:57 - it by the employee anything see in am
