00:01 - [Music]
00:07 - hello guys welcome back to another
00:10 - tutorial hit the bell icon button so
00:12 - that you don't miss out any tutorial in
00:15 - this video I wanted to work on styling
00:18 - our navbar and using a whole bunch of
00:22 - new properties so that you can start
00:24 - practicing using different properties to
00:26 - make the navbar look good but before we
00:29 - do that I wanted to talk about display
00:32 - the display property because we're gonna
00:34 - need it when we use our when we do our
00:37 - navbar so what we're going to do is
00:39 - we're going to go into our HTML and on
00:43 - line 35 underneath the div with the
00:47 - class of container we're gonna create
00:49 - two more divs so let's start by saying
00:52 - div and then enter and I'm going to give
00:56 - this div a class so I'm gonna go inside
01:00 - the first element or the first tag the
01:03 - opening tag I'm going to go inside there
01:04 - right after the V and hit hit my
01:07 - spacebar and say class equals and I'm
01:11 - gonna say box because we're going to
01:13 - create boxes and then inside the div
01:17 - where there's a space to put our text
01:20 - let's say box one and then I'm gonna go
01:23 - ahead and copy this whole thing and
01:26 - paste it underneath except going to
01:29 - change it to box two for the second one
01:31 - alright so they're both going to have a
01:33 - class of box I'm gonna save and then
01:37 - when i refresh if I scroll down I'll see
01:41 - it underneath the the container div but
01:45 - the only thing you really see are just
01:46 - is it's just the text that's all you see
01:48 - but we're gonna go into the style sheet
01:50 - now and we're gonna create real boxes so
01:53 - let's go into the style sheet and let's
01:57 - go underneath our container and let's
02:00 - target our box so dot box and go ahead
02:05 - and put your curly braces in alright so
02:08 - the first thing we want to do is give it
02:10 - a background color so we'll be able to
02:12 - see
02:12 - how much space we're taking up so
02:15 - background and then I'm going to give it
02:18 - my do my colon and I'm gonna say blue
02:21 - and I'm going to hit save and then
02:24 - refresh and this is what happens in in
02:28 - default and if the default is that your
02:32 - divs are going to be they're going to
02:35 - take up the entire space of the width of
02:39 - the screen and they're only going to be
02:41 - as tall as the text however much text
02:44 - you have in there so if you have a whole
02:45 - bunch of text it's going to be a lot
02:46 - taller a lot the height is going to be
02:49 - more but it's only going to follow what
02:51 - the text is in there so if you want it
02:53 - to be taller you have to give it you
02:55 - have to tell it to be taller by giving
02:57 - it the property of height and width the
03:00 - other thing is there's no margin right
03:01 - now so our boxes are stuck together so
03:03 - we can put a margin in there and we
03:06 - could put padding and all kinds of
03:08 - things all right so why don't we first
03:09 - give them give these boxes a height and
03:12 - a width so that they will look more like
03:15 - boxes so I'm gonna say height is I'm
03:20 - gonna say 200 pixels and then if I want
03:23 - it to be a square I'm gonna also say
03:24 - width is 200 pixels sorry about that
03:28 - all right and I'm gonna hit save and
03:32 - then I'm gonna refresh so now we have a
03:36 - width it's a width of 200 and a height
03:38 - of 200 but they're again still stuck
03:41 - together because I need a margin so I'm
03:43 - just going to put a margin on the bottom
03:45 - of both of the boxes and there'll be a
03:47 - little bit of space underneath each one
03:50 - so I'm gonna say margin you know what
03:54 - I'm gonna do I'm going to do the
03:55 - shortcut so I'm going to do
03:57 - I'd like 10 pixels for top and bottom
04:01 - and I would like zero pixels for right
04:05 - and left and I'll hit save and refresh
04:10 - and so now I have two lovely boxes okay
04:13 - now divs are by default block they
04:17 - display in block and that means that
04:19 - they're going to take up all the space
04:22 - that you denote it you know we denoted
04:24 - height and width but
04:27 - it's going to be on top of each other so
04:28 - they're gonna be display and block like
04:30 - this so if we change that so in fact
04:34 - it's that's default so if I say
04:36 - display:block
04:39 - that's default so nothing's gonna change
04:41 - when I do that and it's gonna be the
04:44 - same
04:44 - okay so display is another property that
04:47 - you can use for all of your elements so
04:50 - if I say inline and then I hit save and
04:57 - then I hit the refresh button my box has
05:01 - become only as high or as tall as the
05:05 - text inside so inline will not listen to
05:11 - your height and width or did you know it
05:14 - didn't listen to my height or width it
05:15 - only what it does is it follows what's
05:18 - inside the element the text that's
05:20 - inside the element or the item that's
05:23 - inside if there's an image inside of it
05:24 - it's only going to allow it to be as
05:28 - wide or high as what's inside of it but
05:31 - if I say inline - block then these boxes
05:37 - are going to become big big again and
05:39 - they're going to be side-by-side so
05:42 - that's the difference between
05:43 - display:block display:inline-block okay
05:47 - now what I want to do is I want to go
05:50 - back up to our nav and I want to work on
05:53 - getting this thing to look like a real
05:55 - navbar okay so we're gonna go up to let
06:00 - why don't we go over here - it doesn't
06:04 - really matter where we go but I'm gonna
06:06 - go to after italic and so I'm just gonna
06:08 - do two - enters and what we have to do
06:13 - is let's start with targeting the navbar
06:17 - itself okay because the navbar we're
06:21 - only going to have one navigation so if
06:23 - you if you go back to your index it's
06:25 - okay to target the nav element if you're
06:29 - only gonna have one nav so I'm gonna go
06:32 - ahead and target just the nav so I'm
06:34 - going to say nav and what I'm gonna do
06:38 - is I'm going to first of all give it a
06:40 - background call
06:41 - so background and you can say background
06:44 - or you can say background color either
06:47 - one it's gonna work and they give me a
06:50 - few colors I could choose Oh some
06:52 - popular colors so maybe I'll choose of
06:55 - course I can choose I can totally find
06:57 - my own color but I think I'm gonna do
06:59 - aqua
07:00 - let's do aquamarine marine all right
07:04 - okay
07:05 - and I'm gonna hit save and refresh so
07:09 - now my nav has a color okay now what we
07:14 - want to do is we want to we can Center
07:17 - the text this is something they're going
07:19 - to use a lot anytime you want to Center
07:21 - your text on your page you use this
07:25 - property text align and but it only tech
07:29 - only will work on text it doesn't work
07:32 - on the entire element so I'll teach you
07:35 - that and another time about how to
07:37 - Center entire elements oops
07:41 - text what : why isn't it working okay
07:45 - text the line and we're gonna say Center
07:49 - and we're gonna hit save and so my text
07:54 - goes into the center
07:55 - now these didn't go but I'm gonna get
07:57 - rid of them anyway so it doesn't matter
07:58 - okay now if I want you know what I'd
08:01 - like to do before we continue with this
08:03 - is let's get this to Center the page so
08:06 - that's my h1 so I'm just gonna go over
08:07 - here and say text align and I'll say
08:12 - Center okay and we'll hit save there you
08:18 - go
08:18 - another thing you could say instead that
08:20 - of centers you could say right and it'll
08:23 - go to the right of the page and so it's
08:28 - way over there or you could say left and
08:30 - us back in default okay so we're gonna
08:32 - say Center okay next let's work on
08:39 - getting rid of the underlines on our
08:41 - links so what we're going to do next is
08:45 - target the link tag which is a and then
08:49 - put our curly braces in
08:51 - and most people don't want to have their
08:54 - any of their links underlined so this is
08:56 - a this is a good case where you would
08:59 - use the element name for your entire
09:00 - application all right so what we're
09:03 - gonna do is we're gonna get rid of those
09:04 - underlines so the property is text -
09:10 - decoration - line and my text editor has
09:15 - it right here so I'm just gonna click on
09:17 - it and then I'm gonna say none and I'm
09:21 - gonna save and refresh and so we lost
09:24 - our underline
09:25 - next I'd like to get rid of these bullet
09:28 - bullets and if you remember the bullets
09:31 - were part of the unordered list and
09:34 - usually this is another point when most
09:38 - people want to get rid of the bullets
09:39 - everywhere so we're just gonna we could
09:42 - we could just do it for any unordered
09:44 - list however what if we really really
09:47 - weren't sure so maybe instead of
09:49 - targeting every unordered list let's
09:52 - target the unordered list that's inside
09:54 - the nav and this is how we'll do it
09:56 - we'll say nav and then ul that way we're
10:01 - targeting the UL unordered list that's
10:04 - inside the nav that's a little bit more
10:06 - specific it's a lot safer and so we'll
10:10 - put in our curly braces and the property
10:14 - that we need is list - style colon and
10:20 - then we'll say none and we'll hit save
10:22 - and let's disappear good good
10:27 - okay now we want to get these things to
10:30 - not be in block but we want them to be
10:32 - in line so I believe we should do it in
10:36 - the same place as nav ul mmm
10:40 - no I don't think so I think what we need
10:42 - to do is we have to target the list
10:45 - items themselves each one is a list item
10:49 - so why don't we target just the ones
10:51 - that are inside the nav so again we'll
10:53 - do the same thing as we did just a
10:55 - second ago
10:56 - we'll say nav list item so we're
10:59 - targeting the list items that are inside
11:01 - the nav and we'll say
11:06 - let me just bring it up here so you can
11:08 - see it better okay so we are trying to
11:11 - make it a not block we want it to be
11:14 - inline block so we're gonna say display
11:17 - inline in-line block and save and now
11:28 - they are side by side however they're
11:30 - really small so what we're gonna do is
11:33 - we're gonna give it a little padding
11:35 - padding is gonna be say 30 pixels save
11:42 - and it's a much better size so you could
11:46 - make 25 pixels or 20 pixels whatever you
11:48 - want alright so that's pretty good um
11:51 - now interestingly if I click on the
11:54 - about page our navigation is not the
11:58 - styling is not hooked up to our about
12:00 - page nor is it hooked up to our contact
12:03 - page so to fix that it's very simple we
12:07 - need to go into our about HTML and we
12:11 - need to go into the head underneath the
12:13 - title we are going to put a link tag so
12:19 - hit so type link and hit tab and what we
12:22 - need to do is we need to just write the
12:24 - name of our style sheet which is style
12:28 - dot CSS inside the href style dot CSS
12:33 - and that will connect the style sheet to
12:36 - this HTML page so I'll hit save and then
12:40 - I'm going to go ahead and do the same
12:42 - thing in my contact HTML there's my head
12:46 - there's my title I'm going to go right
12:49 - underneath the title inside the head and
12:51 - we're gonna link the stylesheet to this
12:55 - HTML as well so style dot CSS and save
13:02 - so now when i refresh my contact page
13:07 - has the styling and so does my about
13:09 - page and so does my home page okay all
13:15 - right we did a lot in this video and our
13:18 - next video
13:19 - we're going to be working on more
13:21 - styling there's so much to learn and
13:22 - styling we're gonna start working on
13:25 - images and we're gonna probably do a
13:28 - little bit with shadows and borders and
13:31 - shadow texts and shadows of images and
13:34 - then after that we're gonna start
13:36 - working on something called flexbox and
13:42 - possibly CSS grid we'll be getting into
13:44 - those things later alright see you in
