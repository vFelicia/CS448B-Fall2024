00:00 - so we left out with where if we have
00:02 - created a user
00:03 - so instead of sending a json response so
00:06 - what we will do we will create a message
00:07 - here
00:08 - it says uh android message
00:12 - uh your account
00:16 - is created
00:21 - successfully account is your you can
00:23 - simply give it your account is created
00:25 - okay so successfully
00:29 - so this would be a message to the user
00:31 - and in new dot html
00:33 - rb you can render this message like this
00:36 - so so let's again sign up
00:40 - so let's create on this and just to
00:43 - sign up and let's create a
00:46 - new user who use it and we
00:50 - give a simple password okay uh let's
00:53 - create this and
00:54 - say your account is created successfully
00:57 - if your account is created successfully
00:59 - you should give them a sign up option
01:01 - right so you should give them a sign up
01:03 - option so let's move to write routes or
01:05 - rb so we will do it
01:10 - sign in
01:14 - and we would go to
01:19 - session hash new
01:23 - because now we are instead talking about
01:25 - creating a session
01:27 - sign in and we would put this as
01:31 - sign in okay i hope this is fine
01:34 - and here like if this is a
01:38 - like yeah so
01:41 - what you need to do uh you need to
01:45 - define
01:46 - a variable so what you need to do you
01:49 - need to move it and
01:51 - here your account is created
01:52 - successfully
01:54 - and either you can do this
01:58 - success is equal to
02:01 - success is equal to
02:04 - and what you can do you can remove this
02:06 - message not needed
02:08 - and what you can do
02:14 - if if address success
02:20 - you can end this
02:23 - and end this tag as well
02:27 - if i did success you can say
02:33 - your own is created
02:39 - and you can end this tag
02:43 - and here you can see hrf
02:47 - you can give anchor tag to this anchor
02:49 - tag you would
02:50 - move them to the login i say click
02:56 - click here login
03:00 - i hope this is fine and now
03:04 - i told you a trick that you can move you
03:07 - can
03:07 - check the routes by randomly typing
03:09 - something here and then you can
03:12 - you can check the path and this is the
03:14 - path sign in path
03:15 - so you should copy this path and you
03:17 - should be able to paste this here
03:20 - so this gives a value sign
03:23 - in underscore path
03:26 - and let's close this
03:29 - okay so i hope this is fine so let's
03:34 - yeah so let's again do a sign up
03:37 - and you do new user three
03:41 - and my uh you should give a simple
03:45 - password
03:46 - one two three four five six
03:50 - and here you can see your account is
03:52 - created click here to log in
03:54 - so when you click on this it might
03:55 - return at the error so
03:58 - because this is a like error because you
04:00 - have not defined it
04:01 - and you can move to round.rp and this
04:04 - will be sessions
04:05 - so when you move to this and then it
04:07 - says is missing a template
04:09 - so we will create that okay
04:12 - so we will create a template for that so
04:15 - for that what we got we're going to do
04:18 - so we need to move it here
04:22 - in a session we need to move in the
04:25 - views folder
04:28 - app views sessions and let's create a
04:31 - new file
04:35 - new.html.erb
04:38 - okay so let's create a heading
04:42 - so let's create a heading which one tag
04:48 - let's create this and we need to define
04:51 - h1
04:54 - sign in okay and in the same way
04:58 - we need to define a form
05:03 - okay and let's define this form okay
05:07 - so input type is equal to
05:10 - okay so this form is like for the
05:14 - significant input is equal to email
05:17 - okay and label is equal to
05:21 - you can keep this as anything because
05:25 - since you have created the user so
05:28 - let's keep this very quick do this very
05:30 - quickly
05:31 - label is equal to my name is equal to
05:36 - email
05:38 - and id is equal to email
05:43 - okay and let's close this
05:49 - label for
05:52 - email
05:59 - so let's create the email
06:03 - basically this is our username also so
06:06 - you can comment this and
06:07 - put here and then input
06:11 - heap is equal to password
06:17 - and you can copy this
06:20 - name is equal to
06:24 - password id is equal to password
06:28 - and we can do table
06:33 - for
06:36 - enable for password
06:43 - and we can close this so this is your
06:46 - password
06:48 - now
06:53 - you can do input type is equal to submit
07:00 - value is able to login
07:03 - okay so value is equal to login
07:07 - so what you need to do let's refresh
07:09 - this page
07:10 - and here you get the sign in right so
07:13 - that's great we get a sign-in page
07:16 - now what we need to do we need to define
07:17 - a method is go to post
07:24 - action now let's
07:27 - keep this action as empty and now we
07:30 - need to define a post method for
07:32 - for sign up we define a register for
07:34 - sign in we define a login
07:36 - okay post login
07:41 - and let's now we define us
07:44 - sessions hash create
07:48 - now
07:51 - we define this as
07:55 - login okay so
07:59 - most probably we are going to move in
08:02 - sessions controller and we need to
08:06 - define render json params
08:08 - so the simplicity it is then and
08:12 - we have like
08:15 - the apps we have the views uh we have
08:17 - the new.html and for here we defined
08:22 - person is equal to login underscore
08:30 - and here we also defined percent equal
08:33 - to token
08:36 - so this is how we define the token and
08:39 - like html so it is done
08:42 - yeah so let's just define a user at the
08:45 - rightmail.com
08:47 - let's put the password one two three
08:49 - four five six
08:51 - so yeah it's working perfectly fine
08:53 - great so we are able to create the
08:56 - sign-in page as well
08:57 - now we have to check for the user
08:59 - authentication
09:00 - so next thing what we are going to do
09:04 - so first we will take the user
09:07 - and i'll show you what we're going to do
09:12 - so what we are going to do so what we
09:15 - are going to do we are
09:16 - going to take the email okay
09:19 - and we say items
09:22 - of email so simply see
09:26 - we take the email and password
09:30 - is go to parents
09:33 - of password so this is like we take and
09:37 - now i'll tell you you might also think
09:39 - for the next tutorial what we need to do
09:41 - new you do something like user dot find
09:44 - with this email
09:46 - if it exists if it exists
09:51 - then match for password right match
09:54 - for password else
09:58 - through error so
10:01 - this we are going to do something if it
10:03 - exists then match for password as
10:04 - through error and if
10:07 - it matches if it matches
10:14 - then create a session
10:19 - okay if it matches then create a system
10:21 - so that is what we are going to achieve
10:23 - in the next tutorial thank you everyone
10:25 - for watching this
