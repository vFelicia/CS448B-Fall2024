00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so in
00:03 - this video we are going to continue our
00:05 - discussion on buttons okay so the first
00:08 - thing I will come into this out this is
00:11 - about flat button which we discussed in
00:13 - our previous video okay so the next type
00:17 - of button that we are going to discuss
00:19 - is raised button okay so first I will
00:22 - create a center and that child will be
00:25 - raised button okay so the basic
00:31 - difference between flat button and
00:33 - raised button is that raised button
00:35 - looks a little bit elevated like
00:37 - floating on screen and flat button is
00:39 - infused on the screen okay so if you go
00:42 - to stack overflow you can find a very
00:45 - good example over here you can see this
00:48 - buttons are bulging out over here and
00:51 - these are basically raised buttons okay
00:55 - and then if you scroll down you can see
00:57 - over here the button seems to be infused
01:01 - like there is no difference between the
01:04 - button background and the rest of the
01:08 - body of the alerted dialog so the button
01:10 - seems to be infused in the dialog and
01:12 - such type of buttons are flat button
01:15 - okay so so back in our project over here
01:22 - we have a raised button okay and the
01:24 - East button also takes an on pressed
01:26 - okay on pressed is compulsory for every
01:28 - button okay then over here also I will
01:31 - add a simple anonymous function that
01:33 - says button pressed okay and then I also
01:40 - need to give an child okay so again you
01:45 - can give any text widget I am giving an
01:47 - icon from the icons enum and the icon
01:51 - will be add okay and you can see there's
01:54 - an error over here and that is because
01:56 - we are missing a parenthesis okay now
01:58 - I'll format it and save it so now I
02:00 - should be able to see a button that has
02:04 - a plus icon on it and you can see that
02:07 - and if you look closely you can see
02:09 - there's a little bit shadow at the
02:11 - bottom and on
02:14 - left side so that means the button is a
02:17 - little bit elevated from the screen okay
02:20 - so that is the said axis we have the
02:22 - shadow in the z-axis representing that
02:24 - the button is a little bit elevated okay
02:27 - then we can apply the same properties
02:29 - that we have in our raised button like
02:31 - color okay so the colors is again right
02:37 - so now the button will be in red so on
02:39 - elevated button in red will be visible
02:42 - you can see that ok then similarly we
02:45 - have the color brightness ok then again
02:49 - it is let's say brightness not dark okay
02:58 - and the rest of the features also like a
03:01 - disabled color and on long press ok so
03:05 - now the another property that we have
03:08 - over here is elevation ok elevation so
03:12 - that means how much shadow will be there
03:15 - that means how much will be the length
03:17 - of the Zed axis so let us say if I give
03:19 - 10 so now you can see there's a little
03:23 - bit shadow now if I run this the shadow
03:25 - would be a little bit thicker ok so
03:28 - let's see that and you can see the
03:31 - shadow has become a little bit thicker
03:33 - and it is more significant now ok so
03:36 - this says that the button is a little
03:39 - bit raised and this actually over here
03:42 - acts as the shadow ok and now over here
03:46 - if I make this null the on pressed
03:49 - function as null so then let's see what
03:52 - is the difference like in flat button if
03:55 - we were making it null so no difference
03:58 - in the button was visible just to the
04:00 - functionality was not there okay and
04:02 - that is because we have changed it to
04:03 - null but over here since we are making
04:06 - it null that means we are making the
04:08 - raised button disabled you can see the
04:11 - color automatically changes to our
04:14 - disabled type of thing ok and if you
04:16 - present the functionality is also not
04:19 - there ok so now you can even try adding
04:24 - some disabled color
04:27 - okay so suppose if the button is
04:29 - disabled then the disabled color is
04:31 - let's say this okay so now if the since
04:35 - the button is disabled our color will be
04:38 - this okay and so now you can see the
04:40 - difference okay so this was about wrist
04:44 - button and there are particular
04:45 - scenarios where we need slat button and
04:48 - we need raised button okay so you know
04:51 - we were to use what okay now the next
04:55 - type of button that we are going to
04:57 - discuss is outline button okay so first
05:03 - things first I'll create a body center
05:10 - and the center has a child and the child
05:13 - is outline button so as the name
05:16 - suggests this button doesn't have any
05:18 - background it just have a has an outline
05:21 - okay so first of all on pressed and on
05:24 - pressed I'll create an anonymous
05:25 - function that simply prints in my
05:28 - console button pressed okay and it has a
05:37 - child that is again an icons so that all
05:43 - the buttons have the same icon like all
05:45 - the buttons that we have discussed till
05:47 - now icons are not that okay over here
05:51 - it will only be icon and not icons and
05:54 - now if you save this you should be able
05:56 - to see a and button that only has an
05:58 - outline and the background will be same
06:00 - as the entire screen and you can see
06:03 - that this is our button then it has a
06:06 - boundary okay so this is the default
06:09 - width and height of every button you can
06:12 - change the width and height by using a
06:14 - container and we have not yet studied
06:15 - about container but we will just so if I
06:18 - press you can see button pressed so
06:20 - everything is working fine now the next
06:25 - feature that we have in this outline
06:27 - button is first let's format this okay
06:30 - the next feature is border okay so in an
06:33 - outline button the most significant part
06:35 - is the border so we have our property
06:38 - parameter called border sight and it
06:40 - takes board side with check okay and it
06:44 - is used for designing the border okay so
06:46 - basically this border side is used for
06:49 - all the four sites like in general cases
06:52 - when you give a border to something then
06:55 - you need to give four borders for top
06:57 - bottom right and left but since it is an
07:00 - outline button and in button we want to
07:03 - have the same border throughout so a
07:05 - single border side will only be applied
07:07 - to all the four sites
07:09 - okay so border side takes up color okay
07:12 - that is the color of the border so let's
07:15 - say I give red okay so now you can see
07:19 - the color is something rich now if I
07:21 - save this the border should be in a red
07:24 - color okay and you can see that over
07:28 - here the border is in red color now the
07:32 - next property is width okay that means
07:36 - the border width and it takes off
07:39 - I think double yes it takes our double
07:42 - value and the default width is one okay
07:45 - so if I make it to five point zero then
07:49 - it should then the border should be a
07:51 - little bit taken off okay so and you can
07:55 - see that okay so the border is a little
07:57 - bit thick now the next thing that we
08:01 - have is a sty okay so stylus basically
08:06 - just if you don't want to show the
08:08 - border so if you click on border style
08:10 - none the border will discipline and
08:12 - border-style:solid that is that if all
08:14 - type means the borders border will be
08:17 - there
08:17 - okay so border is there so I will try
08:19 - border style dot none and now my border
08:23 - should be gone okay so there's some
08:26 - error I am missing a parenthesis over
08:28 - here again I will format it and save it
08:31 - and now you can see the water is gone
08:36 - and to bring the water back I will
08:37 - simply just remove this or you can give
08:40 - it a border solid so that would also be
08:44 - fine and this is our outline button now
08:49 - over here also if you want you can add
08:51 - on long pressed and all the other
08:54 - functionalities all the other things
08:56 - that we have seen in slat button and the
08:59 - same goes for raised button all the
09:01 - parameters that we have seen in the flat
09:04 - button can be applied in both raised
09:06 - button and border outline button okay
09:10 - thank you
