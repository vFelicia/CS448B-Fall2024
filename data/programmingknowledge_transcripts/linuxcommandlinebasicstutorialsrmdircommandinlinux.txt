00:00 - so now what i will do
00:02 - i will create a one more directory
00:04 - i will start by creating a directory
00:07 - mkdir
00:09 - ayush
00:11 - okay
00:13 - i have created ayush and
00:15 - now what i have to do
00:18 - uh i have to again create a more
00:20 - directory in ayush cd i use okay
00:24 - mkdir i used to
00:26 - okay
00:27 - i used to
00:29 - now we are done
00:30 - again i will go on the home directory
00:34 - and what i will do i will create one
00:36 - more directory mkdir
00:38 - uh
00:38 - [Music]
00:41 - test67
00:43 - okay so here you can see i usually
00:45 - created already and they are used so
00:47 - directly we have another i used to
00:50 - and x67 where it is oh yeah here this is
00:53 - one okay so i will perform your ls and
00:56 - now you can see all the director which
00:58 - we have created now what i have to tell
01:00 - you like to remove this directory uh
01:03 - the command is rmdir okay remove
01:07 - directory so there is a one thing in
01:10 - this
01:11 - like uh
01:13 - let me clear this all
01:15 - uh if
01:16 - directory
01:18 - is empty
01:20 - okay if like uh suppose this direct test
01:23 - 67
01:24 - there is nothing this is empty directory
01:26 - so in this case we can easily use rmdir
01:30 - okay we can easily use it but if
01:33 - directory is not empty
01:35 - suppose in this case
01:37 - i used to so in this case when we will
01:40 - do rmdir so what will happen like it
01:42 - will uh like it will not delete that
01:44 - particular directly it will show you the
01:46 - error like uh
01:48 - directory is not empty
01:50 - okay but when you will go in the i use
01:52 - direct and when you try to delete i used
01:54 - to then it can be easily deleted y the
01:57 - reason behind is this like i used to is
02:00 - empty
02:02 - okay i hope you got this point like
02:05 - how rmdir command works
02:07 - so uh
02:08 - now our job is to just delete the
02:11 - directory and learn the things okay so
02:13 - let's start
02:15 - so what we will do
02:16 - uh ls
02:18 - now i will first try to delete the test
02:20 - test67
02:23 - test
02:24 - six seven okay
02:26 - so now what will happen i will hit just
02:28 - enter and now boom
02:30 - so your test 67 has been deleted okay
02:33 - now again we will try to do ls here and
02:35 - so you will not see anywhere like that
02:37 - 67 is there
02:38 - now now what we will do
02:40 - and yeah one more software i want to
02:42 - tell you that
02:43 - for clearing the terminal if you do
02:45 - clear then it will clear obviously but
02:47 - there is also one more shortcut like
02:49 - control plus l
02:51 - automatically get clear
02:53 - okay
02:54 - so now what we have to do
02:55 - we have to remove the directory ios
02:59 - okay now let's see what happens
03:02 - fail to remove i use directory not empty
03:06 - okay obviously that is not empty we know
03:08 - like there is another folder
03:10 - in ayush so what we will do now we will
03:12 - go in if directory and then i will try
03:15 - to first delete i used to
03:18 - okay we have deleted
03:20 - and there is no any directory now what i
03:24 - will do i will go back in the home
03:25 - directory and i will delete i use
03:29 - okay so i use has been deleted okay so
03:32 - suppose if there is many folders and
03:34 - directories like suppose they're in i
03:36 - use there is i used two twice hundred
03:38 - okay or in that particular directory
03:41 - there are other more directories okay so
03:43 - you have to delete this so this is very
03:45 - tedious work like
03:47 - uh like it's not easy to do one by one
03:49 - okay so
03:51 - like
03:52 - the solution for that is that
03:54 - like we will use some flax with it okay
03:57 - so now again let me create a direct i
03:59 - will use hyphen p option if you watch
04:00 - previous video then you will get it what
04:02 - is hyphen p and all these things so i'm
04:04 - going to create a note test let's create
04:07 - with
04:08 - ice one
04:10 - is to
04:12 - if3
04:13 - uh so what what uh will happen here like
04:16 - in iowa shown there will be i used to in
04:17 - high school there will be us three
04:19 - so you can check here
04:21 - uh
04:22 - i shown
04:23 - i used to and i standing nicely there
04:25 - will be nothing it will be empty
04:27 - directory
04:28 - so now what i have to do
04:30 - i have to delete this
04:32 - whole directory in single command so
04:35 - what i will do there are multiple ways i
04:37 - will tell you everything each one by one
04:39 - the more different ways okay so we will
04:42 - use
04:43 - rmdir
04:44 - slash s
04:46 - okay
04:47 - and then we will
04:49 - just provide the direction name
04:52 - okay
04:53 - so
04:54 - what this command will do basically it
04:55 - will delete the whole the directory from
04:58 - the root to the end like child like it
05:01 - will start from ios and it will
05:03 - end to the ios 3 and it will delete the
05:05 - whole file structure and with this
05:08 - command it will ask you for the
05:10 - permission
05:11 - like you have you will need to enter yes
05:13 - or no whether you want to delete or not
05:15 - like just like confirmation message it
05:16 - will last for you let's check what
05:19 - happens
05:20 - okay uh it's showing
05:23 - no such filo directory
05:26 - why
05:28 - ah
05:29 - one minute let me check with this iphone
05:31 - help
05:32 - or whether it works in ubuntu or not
05:35 - okay sorry we can use hyphen p option
05:38 - for that okay
05:39 - sorry
05:40 - what do we do rmdir hyphen p
05:44 - i usual
05:47 - i think we will need to provide whole
05:48 - path okay i use three
05:51 - so we can easily have we have deleted
05:53 - easily in this way also we can use rmdir
05:56 - in this way okay but there is also one
05:59 - way
06:00 - uh the slashes i will need to just check
06:02 - with the google uh
06:04 - why this command didn't work
06:13 - not working with ubuntu
06:15 - like i have used this command earlier it
06:18 - was working in my linux machine
06:22 - let me check with it
06:31 - and also let's go with the rmdir slash
06:34 - okay
06:35 - google is your friend buddy like if you
06:37 - will stuck somewhere then this is your
06:39 - only friend where you will get the help
06:42 - okay
06:43 - okay so here is the like documentation
06:45 - microsoft then
06:46 - if it is microsoft then
06:48 - like it should be
06:50 - correct here slices what it's saying
06:52 - deletes a directory
06:54 - this was what i can also directly
06:56 - including all files okay
06:57 - we were correct
07:00 - and this rmdir slash s test to remember
07:03 - directly named test and all this updated
07:06 - okay
07:08 - we were doing the same thing i didn't
07:10 - get uh why it's not working in ubuntu uh
07:13 - like there may be some reason
07:17 - uh
07:18 - here you can see uh like there is uh
07:22 - there may be okay i'll leave it uh
07:25 - i will try one once more let's check it
07:28 - happens or not i will try to create
07:30 - again the same directory
07:32 - i will just hit the
07:37 - what was the command rmdir slashes and
07:41 - uh are you sure it's there
07:45 - okay okay okay okay okay
07:48 - fail to remove okay
07:53 - if i do forcefully then what happens
07:57 - okay it's not working even
08:01 - so now
08:02 - what is the options
08:04 - to delete the whole directory in a
08:06 - single command
08:08 - like uh slash has failed in ubuntu i
08:10 - don't know why
08:11 - we will figure it out later uh but now
08:14 - what is the other way so there is a way
08:17 - so what we will do we can we use the rm
08:19 - command okay
08:21 - with the help of this command uh we can
08:23 - easily delete all the files like in a
08:25 - single command what we will use the flag
08:28 - with it rm hyphen rf okay and then i use
08:31 - one
08:33 - done
08:34 - we are done buddy
08:35 - like rf
08:36 - stands for recursively and fs transfer
08:38 - forcefully we can
08:40 - easily use this rm command to remove
08:42 - these directories in a one single
08:44 - command
08:45 - okay
08:47 - so uh that's all for um
08:50 - today i hope you got it like how we can
08:53 - delete the directories in this uh by
08:55 - using a particular single command or by
08:57 - one by one command like basically uh in
09:00 - the like uh
09:02 - real world we basically use this rmi for
09:04 - rf okay we use it uh
09:07 - because
09:08 - like uh
09:10 - whenever we create a direct it will not
09:11 - be empty like
09:13 - you can get it you can relate it with it
09:16 - like whenever you create then you create
09:17 - it for some kind of purpose
09:19 - that's why so we can easily use this rmi
09:21 - for rf command for this uh removing
09:24 - directory okay so that's all for today
09:26 - uh i hope you liked it uh i hope and
