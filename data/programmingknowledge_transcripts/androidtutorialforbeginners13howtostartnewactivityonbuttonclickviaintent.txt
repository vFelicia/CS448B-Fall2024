00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:07 - to create a new activity and open it
00:11 - using our main activity or first
00:15 - activity so for example for some reason
00:18 - you want to open a new activity or the
00:22 - next activity using your first activity
00:26 - how we can do it we will see in this
00:28 - video so right right now I have this
00:31 - blank project or you can say hello world
00:34 - project and if you don't know how to
00:36 - create this project you can just go to
00:39 - uh the initial videos of this series and
00:42 - see how I have created this blank
00:45 - project so this uh project uh right now
00:48 - have only one activity which is our main
00:51 - activity right now to add a new activity
00:55 - to your
00:56 - um app what you need to do is go to your
01:01 - app here so just select Android and in
01:05 - here in the app category you just need
01:08 - to go to this uh re or res folder and
01:14 - res stand for resources folder and
01:17 - inside this resources folder there is a
01:20 - folder called layout right you just need
01:23 - to right click on this layout folder and
01:27 - go to new and we are going to go to the
01:30 - activity and we will select a blank
01:32 - activity from here so select the this
01:34 - blank activity and in here this uh
01:38 - wizard will open you can give a name to
01:42 - your activity for
01:45 - example
01:49 - second activity okay and everything is
01:53 - uh by default uh created for you and
01:56 - just click finish once you uh click
01:59 - finish there will be a second activity
02:03 - which will be created for you
02:06 - and now you will be able to see in in
02:09 - your layout folder in your resources uh
02:12 - directory there will be a extra XML file
02:16 - created for your second activity which
02:19 - is activity 2.xml
02:22 - similarly in your Java Java folder you
02:25 - will be able to see that there will be a
02:28 - new class added to your your U Java
02:31 - folder which is second activity. Java
02:35 - file and in the Manifest folder here
02:40 - there will be a file called Android
02:43 - manifest.xml file and in here also you
02:47 - will be able to see that um uh this new
02:53 - activity is added to your uh to your uh
02:59 - you know main manifest XML file
03:03 - right now what we are going to do is we
03:07 - are going to uh add in this manifest
03:11 - file where your uh main activity uh XML
03:19 - uh element is there and now you have
03:22 - this second activity uh tag right so by
03:27 - default it's uh
03:30 - blank uh tag in a sense that it just
03:34 - have the name and the title but uh
03:39 - unlike this main activity it doesn't
03:42 - have this intent filter tag so we what
03:45 - we are going to do is we are going to
03:47 - copy this uh intent filter from here so
03:51 - just copy this and go inside your second
03:56 - activity element or tag here and just
04:00 - make a space here and paste this intent
04:06 - minus filter here
04:08 - right and in here what you need to do is
04:12 - you need to change uh this name in the
04:15 - action and the category so the in the
04:20 - category first in the category uh tag
04:24 - you just need to change it to the
04:27 - default because the launch of our app is
04:32 - the main activity which is this one and
04:35 - the second activity is the default
04:37 - activity so just delete this launcher
04:39 - from here and just do do
04:45 - default okay and similarly this name
04:50 - should be the name of your uh uh package
04:55 - okay so just go to your uh activity
04:58 - uncore second. XML file inside your
05:02 - layout folder so just go here and go to
05:06 - the text of this uh folder so this is my
05:10 - activity 2.xml file and in here you will
05:14 - be able to see uh tools colon context is
05:18 - equal to Comm do example do whatever
05:21 - your package name is right you just need
05:24 - to copy this uh path from here which
05:27 - start from com. examle or whatever your
05:31 - package name is just copy this path and
05:33 - once again go to your Android
05:36 - manifest.xml file and instead of this
05:40 - and android. inent do whatever do Main
05:45 - in your action tag you just need to
05:48 - replace it by your second activity
05:52 - package name which is com do example do
05:55 - whatever your package is okay so this uh
06:00 - will be similar to this thing okay so
06:03 - second activity second activity okay now
06:07 - everything is done now we are ready to
06:10 - uh you know create some code to open the
06:13 - second activity from our first activity
06:16 - so I'm going to open my first activity
06:21 - first and in here in the main activity
06:24 - what I'm going to do is I will just
06:27 - remove everything and in here I'm I'm
06:29 - going to add a button and this button
06:33 - I'm going to use to open my second
06:36 - activity so I will just change the text
06:39 - to
06:43 - open
06:48 - second activity for example okay and the
06:52 - ID I will leave it as default which is
06:55 - button okay now what I'm going to do is
06:58 - I'm going to go to my main activity.
07:02 - Java file here so this is the Java file
07:05 - for my main activity and in here I'm
07:08 - going to cast this button so first I
07:11 - will create
07:14 - uh button instance so
07:17 - private
07:21 - static button for example I name my uh
07:26 - variable
07:28 - as button
07:33 - submit and now what I'm going to do is
07:36 - in here just below my oncreate method
07:40 - I'm going to create a new method as I
07:44 - have been doing in the last videos which
07:47 - is a
07:49 - public
07:51 - void and uh for example this method I
07:55 - name it as
07:56 - on
07:58 - click
08:05 - button listener okay it's not going to
08:09 - take any uh
08:11 - argument and now we will write the code
08:15 - of uh this method okay so first thing
08:19 - first first of all we are going to cast
08:22 - this button to its ID so button sbm is
08:27 - equal to
08:30 - button and I will find it by ID so find
08:34 - view by ID R do ID dot button which is
08:39 - the ID of my button and now I'm going to
08:42 - take
08:44 - my button uncore sbm variable and I will
08:48 - add or set a listener to this uh button
08:52 - variable so dot set on click listener
08:58 - and inside this uh set onclick listener
09:00 - I will create a new onclick listener so
09:05 - new onclick listener right so this is
09:09 - simple right and inside this onclick
09:12 - method we are going to create uh object
09:17 - of uh intent class so this is the class
09:22 - which we uh which will help us to open
09:26 - the new activity which is our second
09:29 - activity so let's create an object of
09:32 - intent
09:34 - intent intent for example variable name
09:38 - is intent is equal
09:40 - to
09:43 - new intent and the Constructor of this
09:48 - intent takes uh argument which is the
09:52 - package name of your second activity or
09:56 - whatever activity you want to open so as
10:00 - you remember that we have changed the
10:03 - name of uh this uh action tag here which
10:09 - was this one so I'm going to copy this
10:13 - uh path from here com. example do
10:16 - whatever uh and at the last your
10:20 - activity name comes so in here I will
10:26 - copy this path from here
10:29 - and I'm going to go to my main activity
10:32 - and as an argument of this intent uh
10:35 - Constructor I'm going to pass it here
10:38 - okay so now everything is done now I
10:43 - just need to uh call this intent to
10:48 - start the activity so there is a method
10:54 - called start activity which takes intent
10:58 - uh as a an argument okay so in this
11:02 - start activity just pass your intent uh
11:05 - variable and now everything is done now
11:09 - we just need to call this uh
11:12 - method inside our on create method so
11:15 - just copy the name of this
11:17 - method and just call it inside our main
11:23 - method and now we are going to run our
11:26 - application so now our activity is is uh
11:29 - running now which is our main activity I
11:32 - will click this open second activity
11:36 - button and once we click this our second
11:39 - activity opens by this button we can go
11:43 - back to a first activity and once again
11:45 - when we click our uh button it opens our
11:50 - second activity right hello world okay
11:54 - so in this way you can open your second
11:58 - activity using using your first
12:00 - activity uh by using this intent uh
12:05 - method so in 10th class so I hope you
12:09 - have enjoyed this video please rate
