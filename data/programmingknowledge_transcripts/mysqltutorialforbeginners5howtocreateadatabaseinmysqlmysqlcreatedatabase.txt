00:00 - hello friends welcome to program
00:03 - knowledge so before going to further let
00:07 - me tell you one thing that in our
00:10 - previous videos we talked about
00:13 - introduction of my Square and how to
00:16 - install MySQL server on three operating
00:20 - system on Windows Linux Ubuntu and Mac
00:25 - OS and there is one more thing that I
00:28 - need to tell you is that from now
00:31 - onwards I'll be using my coils for our
00:34 - videos but you need you don't need to
00:38 - worry about that because the process
00:41 - will remain same for our operating
00:43 - system so in this video we talked about
00:48 - how to create databases or schemas in
00:52 - MySQL so let's first of all open MySQL
00:59 - workbench which is a GUI for MySQL
01:06 - queries and you can download it from my
01:10 - icecream website so here you can see how
01:17 - it look like so first of all we need to
01:21 - create a MySQL connection you can see a
01:25 - plus sign here just click on that now we
01:34 - have to provide name for the connection
01:38 - that we gonna make so just write new
01:47 - data you can give any connection name
01:51 - you want and this is the host name this
01:56 - is the default port number for MySQL
01:59 - server click on store in kitchen if we
02:05 - are using Windows then you
02:08 - we'll be seeing storing world just click
02:11 - on that now enter the password which you
02:15 - have entered at the time of installation
02:17 - for the root user and just click OK now
02:28 - we need to configure our server so you
02:32 - can see configure server management just
02:36 - click on that continue here you can see
02:49 - the operating system and MySQL
02:52 - installation type just click continue
02:57 - finish ok now you can see one connection
03:05 - is made just click on that so you can
03:13 - see blend page here it is for writing
03:20 - your queries related to MySQL and here
03:24 - you can see sys stands for system is the
03:29 - by default schemas that is created by my
03:33 - ask you so let's create our own database
03:42 - here you can see create new schema in
03:46 - the connected server schema means
03:49 - basically database just click on that
03:53 - here you can give the name for your
03:57 - database
03:58 - let's give test you can give whatever
04:05 - you want and just
04:09 - a Blair now this this is the most
04:14 - important thing in my ask you this is
04:17 - actually the query Ted software runs on
04:20 - the background because we are not using
04:24 - the terminal we are using the ID
04:27 - integrated development environment so
04:30 - instead of it if we are using terminal
04:34 - then we have to fire this command in
04:38 - order to create a database so just click
04:42 - on apply and it says that our SQL script
04:49 - was successfully applied to the database
04:51 - just close this one and apply changes to
04:59 - test so if we want to see our database
05:05 - we can say here our database Ted is
05:09 - successfully created if we click on it
05:13 - you can see tables views store
05:17 - procedures functions we will see how to
05:20 - create tables in our next video but in
05:24 - this video we only talked about
05:26 - databases so now if we want to create
05:32 - database using query you can create on
05:38 - this button it says create a new SQL tab
05:43 - for executing queries so here you can
05:48 - see we can write our masks
05:51 - well queries here so for creating
05:55 - database we have to fire this command
06:00 - create database and the name of the
06:07 - database let's say data test
06:17 - if you want to fire this query you can
06:21 - see button here it says execute the
06:26 - selected portion of the script so just
06:30 - click on that and you can see a database
06:37 - data test is created if we want to make
06:46 - changes in here we just need to refresh
06:48 - it and changes that I made you can say
06:55 - yeah data rest is created now we want to
07:04 - know how many databases are there and
07:08 - what are they so for that we need to
07:12 - fire show command just right so
07:20 - databases then click on that button and
07:28 - you can see the list of databases that
07:31 - we have on my skill server deck attached
07:35 - MySQL system test now if we want to
07:43 - switch to a database then we can use use
07:50 - command use and then the name of the
07:54 - database that you want to switch in
07:56 - let's say we want to switch to test
08:01 - database
08:10 - now you can see it applies so now we are
08:17 - in test database and currently this
08:22 - database contains no tables but if you
08:26 - contain any table and you want to show
08:29 - the tables then use show tables now it
08:44 - currently showing that there are no
08:46 - tables in our database so now we created
08:53 - the database but what if we want to
08:56 - delete the database so there's a command
09:00 - called drop drop in database in the name
09:10 - of the database so we write test and you
09:22 - can see this green arrow indicate that
09:27 - it executed successfully now if you want
09:31 - to show the list of databases again then
09:35 - we need to perform this query so
09:38 - database is just click on that and you
09:43 - can see there is no taste a top is
09:45 - easier because we deleted the taste
09:49 - database so that's it for this video
09:55 - this video we talked about how to create
09:59 - database how to use and basically how to
10:04 - draw up a database and in our next video
10:07 - we will see how to create tables inside
10:10 - the databases so thanks for watching it
10:22 - you
