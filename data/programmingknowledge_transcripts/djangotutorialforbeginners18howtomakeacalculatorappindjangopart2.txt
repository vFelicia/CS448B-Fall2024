00:02 - again welcome you all to programming
00:03 - knowledge so hey guys this is the link
00:06 - of our new boss tree so like as I told
00:09 - you like we are going to work with we
00:11 - are going to work in this repository but
00:13 - was basically we are going to get
00:15 - projects or in this repository so you
00:17 - can check out the new link of the
00:19 - repository so as soon as we make the
00:21 - project I'll commit the changes on the
00:22 - wash tree so let's get started so like
00:25 - in the previous capture what we did we
00:28 - will run myself
00:30 - Pythian man taught py run server so
00:33 - basically I moved to localhost colon
00:36 - 8080 that project can has multiple apps
00:43 - so this is the root root a port project
00:47 - so our client for this like as soon as I
00:50 - moved to calculator path
00:53 - it says the calculator app is running so
00:55 - like in the last in the end of the video
00:58 - last video I was having some I was
01:00 - having L at this point like when I used
01:03 - to do localhost colon 8080 used to threw
01:06 - me an error that it could not find the
01:08 - path okay something like 4-0 foreigner
01:10 - page so like now what I how did I solve
01:14 - this I like a localhost colon 8080 path
01:21 - shows the calculator app is running at
01:24 - this route we were going to make an app
01:25 - so what I did what I did so I move to my
01:29 - URL start py file of the Chango projects
01:32 - good so like in this you can see what I
01:37 - did like I created a pearl like this is
01:42 - my calculator path okay good now I can
01:45 - read in a new map with the name root AB
01:47 - dot with the name the root I blink the
01:51 - default path to the root after two URLs
01:54 - and I open the root after the oil so it
01:57 - says path track views door true game is
02:00 - older route and I move the magnet return
02:03 - initiative will respond the roof the
02:04 - server has started so this is missing
02:07 - this correspond to row time so I made a
02:10 - route app to make sure that it doesn't
02:12 - who made error on the meadow again so
02:15 - basically I - I did this because they
02:17 - built into it to get multiple apps on
