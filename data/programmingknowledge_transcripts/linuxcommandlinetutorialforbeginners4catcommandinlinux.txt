00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will learn
00:06 - how we can use a cat command in Linux
00:10 - cat is one of the most frequently used
00:13 - command on Linux it has three related
00:17 - function with regard to text files one
00:21 - is displaying text file second is
00:25 - combining copies of uh text files and
00:29 - third is creating new text file so let's
00:33 - see how we can use scat command so I
00:36 - will just press control alt T to open my
00:40 - terminal so I will just press control
00:43 - alt T and it will open my terminal now
00:47 - the Syntax for using cat command is you
00:51 - just need to write cat here and then you
00:55 - uh give options so just give some
00:58 - options and and then you give the file
01:02 - names so for example file one file 2 and
01:07 - so on okay something like this so let's
01:11 - see how we can use cat command so first
01:14 - of all uh you can just give cat and
01:18 - press enter and you can see uh it's
01:22 - giving us this kind of a cursor so we
01:26 - can just type for example hello
01:31 - world and then press enter and it will
01:35 - Echo whatever input we have given right
01:39 - so once again uh I can say Echo
01:46 - input and press enter and it will Echo
01:50 - it again so you can see this is the
01:54 - basic functionality without any option
01:57 - for the cat command but cat is not only
02:01 - the echoing uh you know program it can
02:04 - do uh much more than echoing something
02:08 - so to exit the scat command you can just
02:13 - press controll D which means the end of
02:17 - uh the file so just press controll D and
02:20 - you are out of uh this scat Command
02:23 - right now first of all let's see uh what
02:27 - files we have in our folders so so I
02:30 - will list all the files in the current
02:33 - folder which is my home folder and uh
02:36 - you can see these are all the files in
02:37 - directory in my uh home folder so for
02:40 - example I have this uh file called list
02:45 - one. text okay and I will just show you
02:50 - what are the content of this file so
02:53 - this file contains three lines line one
02:55 - line two and I have a line break or
02:59 - blank line here and then I have the
03:02 - third line okay so I want to print this
03:07 - uh text file on my terminal so I can use
03:12 - cat and then the name of the file so the
03:16 - name of the file is list one. text and
03:20 - press enter and it will display me the
03:23 - content of the file same as like this
03:28 - okay now for example I want to show the
03:32 - content of two files so you can see here
03:35 - I have list one. text here and I also
03:39 - have list 2. text also right so I will
03:43 - just show you the content of list two
03:46 - also so I have uh once again three lines
03:50 - and one blank line here right so for
03:54 - example I want to display the content of
03:56 - both the files I can just add one more
04:00 - uh file name here list 2. text and press
04:04 - enter and then it will combine the
04:08 - content of both the file and display me
04:12 - on this terminal right so the first uh
04:16 - uh use of cat command you can say is for
04:20 - displaying the content of a file right
04:23 - or multiple files now there are some
04:27 - options related to cat command so for
04:31 - example I want to show the line number
04:35 - on uh the every line of the content of
04:39 - the file for example so I can use cat
04:43 - and then minus B which will add line
04:47 - number to
04:48 - nonblank lines okay so I will just uh
04:53 - give the name of my list one. text for
04:58 - example and press enter
05:00 - and you can see it adds the line number
05:03 - to the nonblank line so you uh if you
05:07 - remember my list one have one blank line
05:11 - here right and it will skip or it will
05:15 - not add the line number to the blank
05:18 - line but all the lines which have some
05:21 - content it will add add the line number
05:24 - to them now next command First Let Me
05:27 - Clear the terminal and press enter so it
05:30 - will clear the terminal the next command
05:33 - is get minus n and what it will do is it
05:38 - will add line number to all the lines so
05:41 - for example I will just say list one.
05:45 - text and press enter and now it has
05:48 - added the line number to the blank line
05:51 - also
05:53 - right now for example I have a text file
05:58 - which have multiple line brakes
06:01 - something like this a big line braks
06:04 - right and I want to you know uh display
06:09 - the content of the file and I want to
06:11 - remove uh this these all line break big
06:15 - line break and I just want to show only
06:17 - one line break right so let me save this
06:19 - file and then I will just say
06:24 - cat and I will just give the command
06:28 - minus s
06:30 - and then the name of the file list 1.
06:33 - text and press enter and what this
06:36 - command does is it squeezes blank lines
06:41 - to one blank line okay so here there can
06:47 - be many lines but it'll you know squeeze
06:50 - all the blank line to only one blank
06:53 - line and it will not affect the content
06:56 - of the file remember it will only
06:59 - display the content of the file in this
07:02 - format right so it's not changing the
07:04 - content of the file but only displaying
07:07 - it in our convenient uh you know manner
07:12 - right now the next command
07:16 - is cat minus capital E command so I will
07:20 - just uh revert my changes here and I
07:24 - will save this file and now I will just
07:27 - give cat minus capital E and then I will
07:32 - just uh once again uh give this list
07:35 - one. text right and then it adds this
07:39 - dollar symbol at the end of each line
07:44 - okay so you know that this is the end of
07:47 - the line okay so these are the basic
07:50 - commands and option related to cat
07:53 - command now if you want to know more
07:56 - options related to cat you can just
07:59 - enter men if you remember in the earlier
08:02 - video I have uh shown you how to use men
08:05 - pages so just use men and then just
08:09 - enter cat and press enter and then you
08:12 - will be able to see there are more
08:14 - options related to cat command for
08:17 - example minus a which means show all
08:22 - or minus E which is equivalent to minus
08:26 - V or these are all the options options
08:29 - which you can use with cat command I I
08:32 - just showed you the most important
08:35 - options with cat command so just use man
08:39 - to you know read or learn more about
08:43 - this cat command and when you press Q
08:45 - you quit the these Man pages now uh the
08:50 - cat command can also create new files
08:55 - but this we will see in the next video
08:57 - when I will show you how redirection
09:00 - Works using command line okay so this
09:04 - third functionality of cat we will see
09:07 - in the next video so I hope you enjoyed
