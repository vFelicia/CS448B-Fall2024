00:01 - hello guys welcome to the second video
00:04 - on wpfc shop application tutorial in
00:08 - this video I will show you how to use
00:10 - images with your WPF cop
00:15 - application so in the last video we have
00:18 - seen
00:19 - how we can create a WPF application in
00:23 - cop and we have created this button now
00:28 - this in this video I want to add a image
00:33 - to
00:34 - my application or this main
00:38 - window so what I will do is I will go to
00:42 - my tool
00:43 - box and I
00:46 - will drag and drop image tool
00:51 - from my toolbox in my main
00:55 - window and I will just resize
00:58 - it so that it will fix into
01:04 - my main
01:08 - window now what I will do is I will
01:11 - select this image and then I will go to
01:15 - the properties here and I will search
01:18 - for the source property in the common
01:23 - category so go here and go to this
01:27 - Source
01:28 - category and and one more thing I want
01:31 - to point out when you click this
01:34 - solution right click Your solution first
01:38 - and click this open folder in Windows
01:42 - Explorer so it will open your project
01:45 - folder here and right now you can see we
01:49 - have bin obj folder properties
01:54 - folder so now when I select
01:58 - this Main in main window this image tool
02:05 - and I will go here to the source and I
02:08 - will select any image from my computer
02:12 - so what I will do is I will click this
02:15 - button and this open this choose image
02:18 - Wizard and now I can choose any image so
02:23 - I
02:24 - will search for image in my
02:28 - folder
02:36 - so now for example I choose this image
02:40 - and I click
02:42 - open and it loads into my project folder
02:48 - so it made it automatically made a
02:51 - folder called
02:53 - component and in that component folder
02:56 - it made uh another folder called image
03:00 - and in that folder it is going to save
03:03 - my new image so I click
03:07 - okay and you can see here the image you
03:12 - can see in this image tool and when you
03:16 - go to the folder in which your project
03:18 - is
03:19 - there you will see
03:24 - here a new folder called
03:28 - image create automatically here okay and
03:33 - when you click it your image will be
03:36 - copied in this image folder in your
03:39 - project folder okay so this will be your
03:44 - path or now you
03:47 - can copy and paste more images here and
03:50 - you can give the path for these images
03:53 - from here
03:56 - itself and you can observe here also
04:00 - we have an
04:02 - XML file we have this button already
04:06 - have this button we have this grid grid
04:10 - is the
04:12 - total form of
04:16 - our main window and we have in the grid
04:21 - we have a button which is this and now
04:24 - when we drag and drop this image tool
04:28 - this new
04:30 - code code is automatically generated
04:33 - here for the
04:37 - image so see here it's automatically
04:41 - generated and here is the source in your
04:46 - project folder it has
04:49 - created a folder called component images
04:54 - and there is your image
04:58 - copied so you can now when you run the
05:06 - program you will be able to see your
05:09 - image like this in
05:12 - here now for
05:14 - example you don't want this image here
05:18 - you want the image to be set on the
05:21 - background of
05:23 - your
05:25 - Grid or your main form whatever you say
05:29 - so what I will do is I
05:33 - will copy
05:37 - this from
05:41 - here or what I can do is I
05:45 - can write a new tag here to set the
05:49 - background image so I will
05:53 - write this smaller than sign and then
05:58 - image and then I will give the
06:01 - source so I will
06:04 - write source is equal to and you can
06:09 - give the
06:10 - source
06:12 - as this so you need to give this format
06:18 - in your source so what you can do is you
06:21 - can copy and paste some other image here
06:26 - and you can now just copy this source
06:32 - code which is generated for this image
06:35 - tool I'm just copying here and in here
06:39 - I'm
06:41 - pasting so I copied the path and I
06:44 - pasted it
06:49 - here like
06:52 - this and this can also become your
06:56 - background
06:58 - image so so the this image I'm using for
07:02 - setting my
07:03 - background and what I want is this image
07:07 - should stretch to the length of my form
07:12 - so I will give a new property
07:15 - called
07:17 - stretch and I can give
07:21 - the here the argument uniform to fill
07:26 - like this and I will close my
07:31 - I will close my tag so you see when you
07:35 - write this
07:36 - code the image is set
07:39 - automatically in the background of your
07:43 - grid and
07:44 - now I can remove this this image tool to
07:50 - make it clear so I am removing
07:53 - it like this and now you can see the
07:57 - image is set on the background and
08:00 - nothing is there so now when I run the
08:05 - program it looks like this and if you
08:09 - can if you see when I stretch this
08:13 - form the my image is also stretches
08:16 - according
08:17 - to the size of my
08:20 - form so it will take the size whatever
08:24 - size my form is and it will stretch
08:26 - according to the size of my form
08:29 - so that's why I have given uniform to
08:32 - fill stretch
08:35 - here now I close my program so in this
08:40 - way you can set foreground image or
08:44 - background image in your
08:46 - form
08:48 - so once again what I can do is I can
08:54 - choose an image tool from here and I can
08:58 - resize it
09:00 - once again if you want to give a smaller
09:03 - image Here and
09:08 - Now what I can do is I can select this
09:12 - image tool once again and go to the
09:14 - source in the properties here to the
09:18 - source property click to choose the
09:20 - image you can choose another
09:23 - image for example I'm going to choose
09:27 - some other image like
09:30 - this and I choose this image and I click
09:34 - okay and you see here the image is set
09:39 - here so now you have both background
09:42 - image and foreground image this this is
09:46 - really cool when you want to give your
09:51 - uh uh your style to your application so
09:57 - that's why it's good
10:00 - so I hope you have learned something new
