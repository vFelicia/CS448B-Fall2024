00:00 - so let's add some code to our main
00:04 - activity. Java file so go to the Java
00:07 - folder here and then go to main
00:10 - activity. Java and in here first of all
00:14 - we need to uh import some library to add
00:19 - these fragment fragment manager and
00:21 - fragment transaction okay so just add
00:25 - these three libraries or import these
00:27 - three libraries which is import
00:31 - android.app do
00:33 - fragment second is
00:36 - import
00:37 - android. app. fragment manager which
00:42 - will we will use to change fragment or
00:44 - remove fragment right and import the
00:48 - third Library called
00:51 - Android doapp do fragment
00:56 - transaction okay so you just need to uh
01:00 - add these three libraries and now we are
01:03 - going to add a function okay so let's
01:08 - add a function for example
01:11 - void
01:13 - void
01:15 - uh
01:21 - change fragment for example okay and we
01:25 - will pass one
01:27 - argument View
01:30 - view okay and uh then inside this uh
01:37 - function or method we are going to write
01:40 - our code let's make it
01:47 - public and to resolve this just press
01:51 - Alt
01:54 - Enter now inside this method what we are
01:57 - going to do is first of all we will
02:00 - create an instance of
02:01 - fragment
02:04 - so
02:06 - fragment and we will name it
02:09 - as fragment itself for example okay now
02:13 - we want uh on button click event we want
02:16 - to open a fragment right so what we are
02:19 - going to do is we are going to check
02:21 - which button is clicked first so
02:25 - if vew is equal to find view by ID and
02:32 - we will search for for example ID of
02:35 - button one first of all so R do ID
02:41 - do
02:43 - button which is our first button and if
02:48 - this button is selected we will write
02:49 - some code otherwise if the other button
02:53 - is clicked what we are going to do we
02:56 - will just uh copy the same code but this
03:00 - time we will uh you know check if button
03:03 - two is clicked or not okay now um inside
03:10 - uh the these if condition if button one
03:13 - is clicked what we are going to do is we
03:16 - will assign to this
03:18 - instance
03:21 - the object of fragment one okay so this
03:26 - is our fragment one class which inherit
03:30 - fragment right so uh we can use
03:35 - polymorphism property here so you
03:39 - know to this fragment instance which is
03:42 - uh instance of fragment we can
03:45 - just assign a new fragment one class or
03:51 - object like this okay and if the button
03:55 - two is uh selected we will just call
03:58 - fragment two class which is this one
04:01 - fragment two with a
04:04 - spelling like this
04:08 - okay so it should be fragment two okay
04:12 - so we have created fragment one and
04:14 - fragment two classes whenever we have
04:17 - created uh this uh layout it's
04:21 - automatically created these classes
04:23 - fragment one and fragment two right now
04:27 - once you assigned the instances of
04:30 - fragment one and fragment two to the
04:33 - main fragment
04:35 - instance now we will add a fragment
04:38 - manager and then we will do some
04:42 - transaction so go to your uh first F
04:46 - condition and here we will
04:49 - create an instance of fragment manager
04:53 - we will name it as FM for example is
04:57 - equal to and what we are going to
05:01 - do we are going to call a function
05:04 - called get fragment manager okay and
05:08 - then we will uh create an instance of
05:12 - fragment
05:15 - transaction and we will name this
05:17 - fragment transaction instance as ft
05:20 - which will be FM which is our fragment
05:25 - manager dot begin
05:27 - transaction okay and using this
05:30 - transaction what we want to do is we
05:33 - want to replace or we want to uh you
05:36 - know uh replace the fragment to the
05:40 - fragment one if uh the fragment one uh
05:44 - fragment two is uh uh you know placed in
05:47 - the fragment uh in our main activity
05:51 - then whenever one button one will be
05:53 - clicked it will replace the fragment to
05:56 - fragment one okay so
06:02 - we will just use this ft do
06:07 - replace and this replace function takes
06:10 - two argument one is the fragment ID so
06:15 - if you remember whenever you go to this
06:17 - activity uncore main.xml
06:20 - file here we have given the ID to this
06:24 - fragment right which was fragment place
06:28 - right so we they have created this
06:30 - fragment and the ID for this fragment
06:32 - was fragment place or you can see click
06:36 - this fragment and you can see the ID
06:37 - fragment place here so we will go to the
06:40 - main
06:42 - uh main uh activity. Java file and in
06:45 - here pass the first argument
06:49 - by placing the uh ID of the fragment
06:53 - right so R do ID dot fragment place okay
07:00 - and the second argument it takes is the
07:02 - fragment instance which is this one
07:07 - okay now we will do the same for uh the
07:12 - other if condition if button two is
07:15 - selected what we are going to do we are
07:17 - just going to copy this and paste it
07:21 - here okay with no changes so now our
07:26 - code is almost complete there is one
07:28 - more thing
07:30 - uh I think which is remaining is
07:32 - whenever we uh call fragment transaction
07:37 - we need to commit this uh transaction so
07:41 - uh ft do commit okay so whenever you
07:47 - begin a transaction you need to commit
07:49 - the transaction also so just uh place
07:53 - this transaction code here and one more
07:56 - thing which is remaining is we need to
07:58 - add this method to the button click
08:01 - event of button one and button two so we
08:04 - have created this change fragment method
08:08 - so go to your main activity or activity
08:11 - unor main.xml and in here just choose
08:15 - the button one so just select button one
08:18 - and search for the property
08:22 - called onclick and select your method
08:26 - you which you have created change
08:27 - fragment okay same we will do for
08:30 - fragment 2 so select fragment 2 and
08:33 - search for the property called onclick
08:36 - and select your change fragment method
08:38 - from here so whenever some button is
08:42 - clicked this method will be called now
08:44 - we are going to run our
08:48 - program so now our program is running
08:51 - you can see by default this fragment uh
08:54 - one is selected here uh if you remember
08:58 - we have given green color to to fragment
08:59 - one and red color to fragment 2 right so
09:03 - by default fragment one is selected and
09:06 - whenever I click this button fragment
09:09 - two the fragment two will be set in here
09:14 - right whenever I click fragment one
09:16 - fragment one is set so you can just
09:19 - change these
09:21 - fragments by clicking these buttons
09:24 - right now in these fragments you can
09:27 - create your uh you know functionality
09:31 - like if you want to add some image you
09:34 - want to make a registration form or some
09:38 - you know
09:39 - some UI which you want to add to the
09:43 - fragment and on the button click this D
09:46 - fragment will be uh you know replaced on
09:50 - fly whenever you click button so in this
09:54 - way fragment uh Works in Android I hope
09:57 - you have enjoyed this video please wait
