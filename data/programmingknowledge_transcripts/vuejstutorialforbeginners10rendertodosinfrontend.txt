00:00 - hello everyone welcome to the tutorial
00:01 - number 10 in this tutorial we are going
00:04 - to cover
00:05 - uh we have completed the add
00:07 - functionality in the to-do app
00:09 - and now we are going to cover the the
00:12 - second part that is add mark has done
00:14 - check box or delete button
00:16 - we will use the disk group and this
00:18 - group item to render the same
00:20 - so let's continue with the tutorial so
00:23 - we can move to
00:24 - our directory and this is our app
00:28 - and we can like i can
00:31 - open like you can reveal in file
00:34 - explorer
00:36 - you can click here here and you can copy
00:39 - this path
00:40 - and you can paste this path in your
00:43 - browser
00:44 - and you will have two files that is to
00:46 - do dot app.html and to do app.js
00:50 - so first we are going to carry on with
00:52 - the to-do app.html
00:54 - so we had completed the part i'll show
00:57 - you
00:58 - first we can type in something learn
01:01 - view add my to do here you can see the
01:04 - object has been added a json object has
01:06 - been added
01:07 - and then i can add another to do learn
01:12 - react and at the same time as soon as we
01:15 - added to do the
01:16 - text at the text box gets disappeared
01:19 - and then learn angular
01:22 - so i have added three to do's and you
01:25 - can you can
01:26 - access them and i have object
01:29 - that is i have like to do app.js and
01:33 - that is constant app
01:34 - so one thing i can show you also
01:40 - app this is an app object
01:44 - and here you can see that it will have
01:47 - this function add to do function reset
01:51 - and what i can show you that it also has
01:53 - a data
01:55 - so data is this id heading to rules and
01:59 - to do text
02:00 - so inside inside this array this is an
02:03 - json array which has three json objects
02:05 - that is one is with this second and
02:08 - third
02:08 - so this was i was telling you that we
02:10 - all are adding this json object inside
02:12 - this array
02:13 - so we use this dot to do dot push to
02:16 - to do to because we create a to do
02:19 - object here
02:20 - so you can also rename this as a to-do
02:22 - object for your simplicity
02:24 - and then we push this uh like this
02:27 - works as a to-do object this is a to-do
02:30 - json object
02:32 - and when and so we push this to 2.json
02:35 - object inside this 2do's array
02:37 - so then we get a json rna then i have
02:39 - called a reset method
02:41 - which removes the 2d text and marks are
02:44 - done as a false which was already
02:46 - default as a false
02:47 - and then this dot id is incremented by
02:50 - one
02:50 - to make sure that every uh to-do object
02:53 - has a different
02:53 - id so let's uh continue with the article
02:57 - so i'll create a new method that is
03:01 - i'll show you one we can create a new
03:03 - method
03:04 - uh like one is mark as done
03:06 - functionality and remove to do
03:08 - so before we do that let us create uh
03:11 - first we like first i'll render the
03:13 - tools on the front end
03:15 - so what i can do simply i'll collapse
03:18 - this file explorer
03:20 - yeah and this also so perfectly fine
03:23 - so now like what i can do that i'm
03:25 - inside my app
03:27 - and when i move out to the form i get
03:30 - the
03:30 - to-do's so this will
03:33 - print the json array on the front end
03:36 - let me show you
03:37 - yeah so now the arrow is empty so let me
03:40 - do learn
03:42 - view yeah so this is the json object
03:46 - i've got then learn
03:48 - react
03:51 - yes second json object has been added
03:53 - and learn
03:54 - angular but this is not the correct way
03:58 - to show them on the front end
03:59 - so we will use a functionality that is a
04:02 - for loop
04:03 - that will traverse the each json object
04:05 - and then we will add them
04:06 - then we will render them sequentially so
04:09 - for that what we can do
04:13 - you will we will use the unordered list
04:16 - your class is
04:17 - going to list group
04:21 - list group and this is the default
04:24 - bootstrap class we are giving
04:26 - and then we would use a for loop but for
04:29 - that for loop what are we going to we
04:31 - are going to use a list
04:33 - so li so for that we are going to use
04:36 - li class is go to list group
04:41 - item and this is a particular item
04:45 - and for that what we do
04:49 - we can add a key okay and we have to use
04:52 - a for loop
04:53 - so we use v for
04:57 - to do in to do's
05:00 - so this is our i notation to do first
05:03 - singular
05:03 - into two rules was an array so for every
05:06 - to do in two do's
05:08 - we need to define uh we will render them
05:10 - plus we need to define a key
05:12 - so that a for loop has a unique id
05:15 - and for that we are given to do dot id
05:17 - because it is always unique
05:20 - and then what we can do
05:23 - we can print
05:27 - we can print
05:30 - to do dot to do text
05:36 - okay so when i refresh this page i get
05:39 - empty array then learn view
05:43 - so you here you can see that i've got a
05:44 - list group item
05:46 - then learn react
05:50 - yeah so this is now looks perfectly fine
05:52 - and
05:53 - learn angle
05:57 - so this is all we get in in the list
05:59 - view so this looks perfectly fine
06:01 - so i'll remove all the render part and
06:02 - console.log statement when we uh
06:05 - when we are fully done with the
06:06 - development so that the
06:08 - it's it's like optimized so now what we
06:11 - can do
06:13 - we can add two things one is a checks
06:18 - box
06:20 - so we will add this inside this and
06:23 - before that what we can do we can style
06:26 - this a little bit
06:28 - style is root text align is equal to
06:30 - center and
06:31 - and font weight would be bold
06:35 - won't wait
06:38 - would be bold so when we refresh this
06:43 - and add something
06:44 - we get bold and in the center now we can
06:47 - to tap it add two things one is a button
06:54 - so this button
06:59 - will add a button and this would be
07:02 - for the delete functionality
07:06 - uh this is for the delete functionality
07:07 - sorry for the spending mistake
07:11 - delete functionality and we'll have
07:14 - input input
07:18 - type is able to check box for markers
07:21 - done functionality
07:23 - so when i refresh this page what i see
07:29 - yeah so i'll add it to do something a
07:30 - random text here so this is a delete
07:32 - button and input type due to checks
07:34 - check uh this is a check box to make it
07:37 - mark as done or delete
07:39 - so what i can do i can add
07:43 - a label for this input type is equal to
07:45 - checkbox
07:47 - or i can i can add a text here
07:56 - click on
07:58 - check box to mark
08:03 - as done or
08:06 - click on delete
08:10 - to remove i hope this is fine
08:14 - click on delete to remove so
08:17 - when i click this so yeah i get uh
08:21 - so click on check box to mark as done or
08:23 - click on delete to remove
08:25 - so this is a like temporary text and
08:28 - you can align this to the center as well
08:34 - style is equal to we need to add the
08:38 - style
08:38 - style is equal to text align center
08:43 - yeah so perfectly fine so
08:46 - let me add something yeah so we have two
08:48 - button
08:49 - in checkbox to complete or delete so
08:52 - we can uh like we will continue
08:56 - this in the next tutorial so for that
08:59 - what we are going to do
09:01 - we are going to create a function that
09:04 - is
09:04 - delete to do
09:09 - and this would be like
09:13 - they need to do we have to complete this
09:15 - function and i'll put a comma sign here
09:18 - so delete sorry for the mistake
09:23 - yeah so we will complete this delete to
09:25 - do function
09:26 - and input type is equal to check box and
09:29 - what we are planning to add that as soon
09:31 - as we make it mark is done the
09:32 - background changes it to the green
09:34 - so this would be marked as a done and
09:36 - would be differentiate
09:38 - ourselves from the other two those so
