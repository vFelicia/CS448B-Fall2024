00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use alert dialog box on our
00:09 - Android activity alert dialogue box you
00:13 - can use to alert the user for some
00:17 - action for example uh by clicking some
00:20 - button user can decide if you want to uh
00:24 - you know close your application or not
00:27 - so let's get started and uh I I will
00:30 - just take a button to open this alert
00:33 - dialogue and I will change the name of
00:36 - this button as alert for example now I'm
00:40 - going to go to my uh main activity. Java
00:45 - and in here I'm going to create a button
00:48 - variable so
00:52 - private
00:56 - static
00:58 - button
01:01 - button
01:02 - underscore SPM for button submit okay
01:06 - and now we are going to create a method
01:10 - which we will call on button click
01:13 - events
01:15 - so
01:18 - public
01:20 - void
01:23 - on
01:25 - button
01:28 - click
01:32 - listener and in here inside this method
01:36 - I'm going to cast my
01:39 - button submit variable which is uh this
01:43 - variable which I have
01:45 - declared and I will assign the ID to it
01:51 - so
01:52 - button
01:54 - find view by ID r. ID do
02:00 - the ID of the button okay now I'm going
02:04 - to use this uh button to set uh onclick
02:10 - event okay so button
02:13 - dot set onclick listener and inside this
02:18 - uh function we will create a
02:22 - new onclick
02:24 - listener and inside this onclick
02:27 - listener we are going to create uh alert
02:31 - dialogue okay so let's create alert
02:35 - dialogue alert
02:38 - dialogue and we will name it as
02:42 - uh alert for example alert variable so
02:46 - alert dialog.
02:49 - Builder with capital
02:56 - B and we name it as
03:03 - a builder for example is equal to
03:08 - new alert
03:14 - Builder alert
03:17 - dialogue.
03:19 - Builder and we are going to create this
03:23 - alert dialog box on this activity so we
03:27 - will just assign it to this class
03:30 - and
03:32 - now in here we are going to create a
03:37 - message for this Builder so I'm going to
03:41 - copy this uh variable which is a
03:45 - builder and then we will call set
03:50 - message method on this Builder so
03:55 - set
03:57 - message and inside this set message we
04:01 - can uh you know call some uh
04:06 - uh message inside this set message so in
04:10 - double Cotes for example we can display
04:12 - a message do
04:15 - you want
04:19 - to
04:20 - close this app
04:24 - okay and if the user want he can close
04:28 - it so uh we will provide the some a
04:33 - method to this alert box for example
04:39 - set cancel lab and this should this
04:45 - alert box should not be cancelable so we
04:48 - will just set it as
04:50 - false and
04:53 - then so let's uh shift it to the next
04:57 - line so that we can see it better
05:00 - and
05:02 - then after this we have set the cancel
05:07 - uh button to false and then now we are
05:11 - going to set the positive button for
05:14 - example yes if uh in condition if that
05:19 - condition arises that uh we want to
05:22 - display yes or no uh condition or button
05:25 - on this alert dialogue box then uh how
05:29 - we can do it so
05:31 - set positive button and in this uh it
05:36 - takes some arguments so when you hover
05:39 - over this U method you will be able to
05:43 - see that it can take some argument or
05:48 - you can just directly hover over this
05:50 - and uh click inside this method and it
05:54 - will show what are the argument it it
05:58 - takes so the first argument it takes is
06:01 - the title or text of this uh yes button
06:05 - so we we will just give yes to
06:09 - it and the second uh argument which it
06:13 - takes is the on click list now because
06:16 - it's a button so that we can set on
06:20 - click listen on this button so we can
06:22 - set positive button and negative button
06:26 - for two condition if the condition is
06:28 - true or condition is false okay so the
06:33 - next is the new on click
06:39 - listener and in this on click listener
06:42 - it will create a onclick method for you
06:45 - automatically and in here you just need
06:47 - to call Finish okay Finish method just
06:53 - uh closes your app gracefully so if the
06:55 - user wants to close the app he can click
06:59 - this yes yes button and it will close
07:01 - your app gracefully otherwise just go uh
07:05 - outside this set positive button and
07:08 - just go below that and Dot set negative
07:12 - button and we can set negative condition
07:15 - also and the first argument of this is
07:18 - the text on this button second argument
07:21 - is the onclick method so new onclick
07:26 - listener and in here also we can uh call
07:31 - a method to cancel this dialogue box so
07:35 - in here you can see this dialogue
07:37 - variable inside this onclick U uh method
07:42 - so just call this dialog do cancel and
07:45 - this will close your alert right and now
07:50 - outside this uh negative button I will
07:52 - just
07:56 - give this semicolon here so that that we
08:01 - can close this method so what we have uh
08:04 - done basically here is we have uh
08:08 - created a method and inside this method
08:12 - we have created a button variable and we
08:16 - have casted it and we have taken the ID
08:19 - of this button and then we call uh on
08:23 - this button set on this onclick listener
08:27 - new onclick listener and inside this on
08:29 - click of this main button we have uh
08:32 - created our builder for the alert uh
08:36 - dialogue right and on this alert Builder
08:40 - variable here we have called set message
08:43 - so this is the message it's going to uh
08:45 - display the second method we have called
08:48 - is set cancellable so it's uh not going
08:52 - to show any cancel button so we have set
08:55 - it to false then we have called set
08:58 - positive so this is the positive button
09:00 - it's going to show this alert dialogue
09:03 - and the text it's going to show is yes
09:05 - and on click uh event of this uh button
09:10 - we are just closing our app gracefully
09:14 - otherwise we have set the negative
09:17 - button for the negative condition and we
09:20 - will uh just close this app uh close
09:23 - this alert dialogue Box by calling this
09:27 - button uh this method called dialog.
09:30 - cancel
09:31 - okay and I think uh in here where I have
09:35 - defined alert dialog. Builder aore
09:38 - Builder is equal to new alert dialogue
09:41 - in here I must
09:44 - uh remove this uh brackets from here and
09:49 - instead of this we can just
09:53 - call we can just call the name of our
09:56 - activity class which is Main activity
10:00 - and then we can call this on Main
10:03 - activity so in here after
10:06 - Builder just before
10:09 - this this you just need to write main
10:13 - activity do this okay so now we have
10:16 - created our Builder right just below
10:20 - this uh Builder method or build a code
10:25 - just below this we are going to create
10:27 - our alert dialog now so alert
10:32 - dialogue and we will name it as
10:37 - alert is equal to and now we will
10:42 - uh take our builder for the alert
10:45 - dialogue and we will create a new alert
10:48 - so alert Builder do create right after
10:54 - this this from this alert dialogue
10:57 - instance you can can set the title on
11:00 - this uh alert box for
11:05 - example
11:08 - alert and then you can call show method
11:13 - to show this alert dialog box so alert
11:16 - dot show okay so now your code is
11:22 - complete so we can uh call this method
11:25 - inside our on create method so this is
11:29 - was our method uh so just copy this
11:32 - method and inside your on create method
11:36 - you can call this method so just paste
11:39 - this method inside your on create method
11:42 - now I'm going to run my
11:44 - application so my application is running
11:49 - now and this is my alert button so when
11:52 - I click this alert button
11:55 - here a new alert dialogue box appears
11:59 - right the title of this alert is alert
12:02 - which we have set and uh this is the
12:05 - message which we have set do you want to
12:07 - close this app right and there are two
12:10 - buttons no and yes for example we click
12:13 - no button nothing happens just uh uh
12:16 - this alert dialog box uh closes right
12:20 - now once again I'm going to open this
12:22 - alert dialogue and this time I will
12:25 - click this yes and when I click yes it
12:28 - gracefully uh closes my app right once
12:32 - again I will uh start my app open it no
12:36 - nothing happens it just closes the alert
12:39 - dialogue and yes it closes my app so in
12:43 - this way you can use alert dialogue in
12:47 - your Android activity I hope you enjoyed
