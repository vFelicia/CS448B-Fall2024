00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners now I'm not going to give you
00:08 - the basic or brief introduction of
00:10 - Android because uh you may know or you
00:13 - must know uh what is Android most of the
00:16 - mobile devices and nowadays TV and uh
00:21 - variable technology uses Android as
00:24 - their main operating system so I'm going
00:26 - to start this video series how we can uh
00:30 - download and install and configure
00:33 - Android app development environment and
00:36 - we are going to uh use Android Studio to
00:39 - develop our Android uh apps so to
00:44 - configure Android Studio first we need
00:47 - to have Java in our operating system so
00:52 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:54 - you can download and install Java jdk
00:57 - and configure the environment variables
01:00 - and in the next video I'm going to show
01:02 - you how you can download and install
01:05 - Android studio and configure it to
01:08 - develop Android
01:10 - applications so let's get started first
01:12 - of all we need to uh download Java so
01:15 - just search for Java
01:19 - jdk and uh search for
01:22 - it it's ja Java jvdk and most probably
01:27 - the first link here will appear from ww
01:29 - w w. oracle.com
01:33 - and/ some URL so click this uh link here
01:38 - and in here you just need to click ask
01:42 - me later and in here in this web page
01:46 - you may see two options one is uh net
01:49 - beans with jdk8 and uh second is Java
01:54 - platform so net beans is an IDE to
01:58 - develop Java applications and at this
02:00 - time we don't require this we are going
02:03 - to download this uh Java on our system
02:06 - so just click this icon
02:08 - Java and in here you may see different
02:12 - uh options for downloading Java jdk for
02:15 - uh Windows Mac Linux Solaris and other
02:20 - operating systems and uh this series uh
02:23 - I'm going to show you uh how to and
02:27 - develop Android apps on Windows so we
02:30 - will do it on
02:32 - windows so just click the option I
02:34 - accept and in here uh if you're running
02:38 - Windows 8 it's uh most probable that
02:41 - your operating system is 64-bit
02:43 - operating system so I'm going to
02:45 - download this 64-bit um uh Java
02:49 - executable file from here so just click
02:52 - this uh jdk minus 8 q25 at the time of
02:58 - making this video jdk 8 is is the latest
03:00 - one so I'm going to click this link to
03:04 - download this jdk file which is an
03:07 - executable file and it can take some
03:12 - time to download so uh I will let it
03:14 - download and uh I will see you when it's
03:18 - fully
03:19 - downloaded so now my download is
03:22 - complete and I'm going to run this
03:23 - executable
03:25 - file and I will say yes and it will
03:29 - prepare the installer for us for uh
03:33 - installing
03:35 - Java and once uh this is prepared it's
03:38 - uh easy to install Java you just need to
03:41 - click some next buttons and most
03:44 - probably uh it will be installed uh in
03:48 - few minutes on your uh Windows operating
03:51 - system or if you are using I think they
03:54 - already give uh updates for Java so you
03:57 - don't need to do anything and and it
04:00 - says that Java is already there in my
04:03 - computer so I don't need to do anything
04:07 - so once uh you have uh you know
04:09 - installed this Java it's not a rocket
04:12 - science to install Java you just need to
04:14 - click uh some next button and most
04:17 - probably after everything is finished
04:20 - you just need to click this finish
04:21 - button and once it's installed you will
04:24 - be able to see in your uh PC in C folder
04:29 - or of your uh operating system in here
04:32 - you just need to go to program files and
04:35 - in here you will be able to see this
04:37 - Java folder in your C and/ program files
04:43 - folder and in this uh Java folder there
04:46 - will be two files one is jdk folder and
04:51 - second is JRE folder jdk stands for Java
04:55 - development kit and JRE stands for Java
04:59 - runtime
05:00 - environment so for our purpose for
05:03 - developing app on Android Studio we need
05:06 - this
05:07 - jdk so what we need to do is we need to
05:10 - set the environment variable for uh Java
05:15 - so that Android Studio can recognize
05:18 - this so what I will do is I will copy
05:21 - this uh path from here which is C colon
05:26 - SL program files SL Java SL
05:30 - whatever is the name of your jdk folder
05:33 - so it's starts from jdk so just copy
05:37 - this path from here and now we are going
05:41 - to uh go to the system so just search
05:45 - for system and in the system we are
05:49 - going to uh go to Advanced system
05:52 - settings okay so go to the advanced
05:55 - system
05:56 - settings and in here in the advanced
05:59 - system settings you need to click
06:02 - environment variable which is this
06:04 - option and in here what you need to do
06:07 - is you just need to uh click in this
06:11 - system variable you just search if uh
06:15 - this Java home variable is there and if
06:18 - it's not there you just need to click
06:21 - new most probably you need to uh give
06:23 - this environment variable so click new
06:26 - and in here you just need to write Java
06:30 - uncore home all in capital so Java
06:35 - underscore
06:37 - home everything is capital so you uh
06:41 - should do or you should write this Java
06:43 - home exactly the same Java unor home
06:47 - okay and then copy the path or paste the
06:51 - path which you have copied from here
06:53 - which was uh your C colon SL program
06:58 - file slj Java / jdk okay this path you
07:02 - will get after installing Java jdk so
07:06 - you just need to do this click okay and
07:10 - click okay and click okay and everything
07:14 - is done so now Java jdk is installed on
07:19 - your system and you have successfully
07:21 - set the environment variable for
07:24 - jdk so that's it for this video in the
07:27 - next video we will see how we can
07:29 - download and install Android Studio for
07:33 - developing our Android apps so stay
07:36 - tuned and please write coming subscribe
07:38 - and bye for
