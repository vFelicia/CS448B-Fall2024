00:00 - hello everyone welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge so this is the 34 tutorial
00:04 - series
00:05 - so i again welcome you all to
00:06 - programming knowledge so in this
00:08 - video we are going to implement the
00:09 - update operation so let's get started
00:12 - with this
00:12 - so basically uh here i have my to-do app
00:15 - so we
00:16 - click on list all to lose so we have a
00:19 - uh
00:19 - all to do list so basically we want to
00:22 - have a update operation here or
00:24 - edit operation so for that what we can
00:26 - do
00:27 - we can we can move to our list.html
00:30 - and copy this and click here
00:34 - edit and change this button to button
00:37 - warning
00:41 - and and here we can have the edit
00:44 - operation
00:46 - so for that i'll refresh this page so
00:49 - i'll have the edit operation okay fine
00:51 - uh for this edit operation to have the
00:53 - happen we have to have a url dot py
00:56 - so basically like for the delete one we
00:59 - will have
00:59 - for that for edit edit so basically i
01:02 - tell you the difference between the edit
01:03 - and update
01:04 - so basically uh right now we are
01:06 - implementing the edit operation
01:08 - so views dot edit and name is equal to
01:11 - edit
01:12 - i hope this is fine so and
01:15 - in use then we will move to use dot py
01:17 - file so
01:19 - here we mentioned views.edit so we'll
01:22 - implement edit operation here
01:24 - so for that we'll divide edit define
01:26 - edit
01:28 - i'll give request an id
01:32 - okay so and what we'll do
01:36 - so i'll copy this line so basically we
01:40 - are going to
01:41 - render a new html file known as
01:44 - edit.html
01:46 - but before that we need to find the
01:48 - object which we are going to do
01:50 - so object is going to to do so basically
01:53 - like in the delete operation we did this
01:56 - we did this
01:57 - uh we got the object which we have to
01:59 - delete
02:00 - so in the same way we are going to find
02:01 - the object we have to edit
02:04 - so then my dictionary is equal to this
02:08 - which would give title is equal to
02:11 - object.title
02:15 - object.title then
02:18 - description description
02:23 - is good object dot
02:26 - description then priority
02:33 - is go to object dot
02:36 - priority okay so then if we want to so
02:40 - basically
02:40 - the object we want to edit will get the
02:43 - object
02:44 - then these are the properties or
02:46 - attributes referring to the
02:48 - that object and then we'll pass to
02:50 - edit.html okay i'll tell you why we'll
02:52 - pass to edit.html
02:53 - before that we'll look for index.html so
02:56 - this form was for the
02:58 - this form was for the uh submit part so
03:01 - we will copy this form
03:03 - okay then i'll copy this form i've
03:06 - created a new file edit.html
03:08 - okay okay i'll not directly copy this
03:12 - i'll do one thing first i'll copy the
03:14 - extend template
03:15 - so this would get me the extent template
03:18 - then i would
03:19 - remove this okay
03:22 - then i will do edit
03:27 - edit to do okay edit data
03:32 - whatever you want then now i'll move to
03:35 - index.html
03:36 - i'll copy this form okay then i'll copy
03:40 - this form and
03:40 - paste it here okay so i have this
03:44 - so i'll complete two disks so this would
03:48 - yeah now i already know i'll show you
03:51 - one thing when i
03:52 - refresh this page i click on edit so
03:54 - i'll move to this form
03:56 - but still no this form is empty okay
03:59 - first i'll change this add
04:02 - button to update okay
04:07 - first thing i'll do this second thing
04:09 - i'll do this i'll
04:10 - uh change this url submit to your
04:15 - update uh okay
04:18 - let it be submitted now i'll tell you
04:20 - one thing so
04:22 - i have a title here so i'll give a value
04:24 - is equal to
04:26 - title which we had rendered using the
04:28 - dictionary
04:31 - so this would i'll refresh this page so
04:32 - i have basketball here okay
04:34 - so perfectly fine in the same way i'll
04:37 - have the description
04:41 - and in the same way i'll have the
04:42 - priority as well
04:47 - priority as well so perfectly fine it
04:50 - will work
04:51 - so i'll have a priority as there okay so
04:54 - now
04:55 - what we are going to do so we have this
04:58 - so basically we want to update this so
05:01 - we can update this very easily so what
05:04 - we can do
05:05 - uh we will move to urs.py file
05:10 - and define an update operation
05:15 - update and i'll take an integer id
05:18 - here again then again so i was telling
05:21 - you there's a difference between an edit
05:23 - and update
05:24 - so now we'll update this update and name
05:26 - is go to
05:29 - update
05:33 - okay so what we'll do
05:38 - so we will move to use dot py file
05:44 - define update request id
05:48 - so this is particularly same this would
05:50 - be very much same as the submit
05:52 - operation
05:53 - okay but there would be a minor change
05:55 - i'll tell you
05:57 - so first we are not going to create a
06:00 - new object we are going to update the
06:01 - object with the given id
06:03 - so this is fine uh
06:06 - we need to create a import
06:10 - date time okay
06:13 - and updated add
06:16 - underscore will go to datetime.datetime.
06:21 - okay and then
06:25 - object dot created at
06:29 - created ad is you do updated ad
06:34 - so this would work fine so this was
06:37 - telling you that
06:38 - we need to first find the object we are
06:40 - going to update then title is go to
06:42 - title description priority then date
06:44 - time we will create a
06:46 - new date that is updated at and we will
06:48 - resign it to the creator and then we'll
06:50 - save it
06:51 - and then we're going to return this
06:52 - list.html
06:54 - and one thing we're going to change here
06:56 - is that
06:57 - we are going to change this to update
07:02 - that is id but still uh one thing i'm
07:04 - missing that i have not
07:06 - rendered the id from use dot py file so
07:08 - i will do this
07:10 - now this should work fine this is id
07:13 - object
07:13 - dot id okay
07:17 - and in my edit dot html this should be
07:20 - with curly braces
07:23 - so this should work fine so let me
07:26 - create a new to do
07:29 - new to do new to do now
07:34 - okay uh give me a priority number of 500
07:38 - i'll submit here
07:40 - so it has been created now click on edit
07:44 - so new to do now is new to do now now
07:47 - again
07:49 - okay new again
07:54 - so hopefully we check let me check
07:57 - uh this is yeah new to do now new to do
08:00 - now
08:00 - so yeah so now what we are going to do
08:05 - let me edit this and
08:08 - type new to do now again
08:12 - then again okay and i have the priority
08:16 - number of 505
08:19 - so it told me an error like a page not
08:27 - found
08:31 - okay let me check to in my url.ufi
08:35 - okay this was having an issue
08:40 - yeah so yeah i've got a head made so
08:43 - here you can see
08:44 - this has been changed okay new to do now
08:47 - again
08:48 - 505 had been changed so basically in the
08:51 - same way
08:52 - let me edit any one this is cricket 89
08:55 - so i click on edit so this is a cricket
08:58 - cricket
08:59 - okay i'll change it to football
09:04 - football again new
09:07 - something like that so cricket new
09:11 - and i'll give a priority number of 899
09:13 - so let me check
09:15 - so yeah here you can see this has been
09:17 - updated football again new 899 cricket
09:20 - new
09:20 - and the time had been updated
09:23 - accordingly
09:24 - so this works perfectly fine so we are
09:27 - almost done with that to do app
09:29 - so we'll catch you in the next tutorial
09:33 - so what we can implement next so
09:35 - basically we are done with the
09:36 - uh all operations so basically uh
09:40 - uh okay one thing i noticed here
09:44 - something
09:45 - let me check yeah this is basketball new
