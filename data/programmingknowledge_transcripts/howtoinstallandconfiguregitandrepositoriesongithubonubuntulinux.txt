00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can install and
00:04 - configure git on your runtu Linux
00:07 - operating system and I'm also going to
00:10 - show you how you can create and
00:12 - configure repository on GitHub so that
00:16 - you can transfer file to GitHub using
00:20 - git so let's get started first of all
00:23 - you need to install git so the command
00:27 - is p
00:28 - sudo apt minus
00:32 - get
00:35 - install git okay so Pudo app minus get
00:40 - install git and give your
00:43 - password and it will install git on your
00:46 - system the git is already installed in
00:49 - my system so it says it's newly
00:51 - installed but uh in your case it's going
00:54 - to take uh few seconds and uh it will be
00:57 - installed you don't need to do any extra
01:00 - things okay once you have installed git
01:04 - on your open to operating system you
01:06 - need to open your
01:08 - browser and go to github.com
01:13 - okay and in here you need to create an
01:18 - account if you don't have already
01:21 - otherwise if you have already uh a
01:23 - created account you can sign it sign in
01:26 - with your account okay so creating
01:28 - account is not not very difficult you
01:31 - can just give your username password and
01:33 - email ID and it will be created and once
01:37 - you created your account you just need
01:39 - to log in with your account so uh I just
01:42 - need to give my username and password
01:44 - and sign
01:46 - in and now I can see uh this dashboard
01:50 - of git okay now what uh I need to do is
01:55 - I need to uh set up
01:58 - my get username and email ID on this OB
02:04 - 2 right so what I need to do is I need
02:07 - to give this command git config minus
02:12 - minus Global space user.name and in
02:16 - double course you need to give your
02:18 - username this username should be
02:21 - identical to your username which you
02:23 - have provided on GitHub okay so just
02:29 - give this command and press enter this
02:32 - will set up your
02:34 - username uh on git right in the same way
02:40 - you just need to provide your uh email
02:44 - by just giving this command I'm going to
02:47 - give you all the commands in the
02:49 - description so you don't need to worry
02:51 - about the commands you just can uh copy
02:53 - these commands and paste it on your
02:56 - terminal so the second command you need
02:58 - is get config minus minus Global user do
03:04 - email and in the double codes you just
03:07 - need to give your email ID okay and
03:10 - press enter and now you can uh go to
03:14 - your GitHub and just click this button
03:18 - which says create repository and then
03:22 - create a new repository click create new
03:25 - repository and in here you can give the
03:28 - name to your repository for for example
03:31 - get
03:33 - test and you can provide the description
03:35 - for your uh repository for example this
03:40 - is just for test and then you can choose
03:45 - whether you want public or private
03:47 - repository public is free for you but if
03:50 - you want to choose private you need to
03:52 - pay some money for this so I'm going to
03:56 - choose this public and then I'm going to
03:59 - just just click this create repository
04:04 - button and then my repository is
04:07 - created so once this repository is
04:10 - created Let's uh create a directory for
04:13 - this in our open to operating system so
04:17 - what I'm going to do is let's see what
04:20 - I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
04:23 - directory in my home folder so mkdir for
04:28 - make directory
04:30 - and my directory name would be for
04:33 - example I will give the same name git
04:35 - test okay so
04:39 - get
04:41 - test and the directory has been created
04:45 - and now I'm going to go to my git test
04:49 - directory and it's empty right now and
04:52 - now what I can do is I can simply follow
04:57 - these commands which uh GitHub uh tells
05:01 - me to do so first of all it's
05:04 - recommending me to create a read me file
05:08 - so I'm going to create it so just copy
05:11 - all these commands one by one and give

05:21 - going to copy this command go to my
05:24 - terminal paste this command and then
05:28 - press enter it's going
05:31 - to create a
05:34 - readme.md file inside my uh git test
05:39 - directory and then the second command is
05:43 - to initialize git in my directory so I'm
05:46 - just going to give git in it and press
05:50 - enter and it says initialize empty git
