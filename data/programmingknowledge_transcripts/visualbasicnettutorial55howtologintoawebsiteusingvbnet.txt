00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can log to a website
00:06 - using your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:08 - application so let's get started what
00:11 - I'm going to do is I'm going to take uh
00:14 - two text boxes for username and password
00:17 - of the website for entering username and
00:20 - password of the
00:21 - website and I'm going to take two
00:27 - labels one and
00:30 - two and I'm going to take two buttons
00:34 - one button is
00:36 - [Music]
00:38 - to open the website and one button is to
00:42 - log into the website so let's take two
00:49 - buttons and I'm going to just change the
00:53 - text of these but labels first first is
00:57 - username so I will write user second
01:01 - is
01:03 - password so write password and first
01:07 - button is to open website so I will say
01:12 - open web for example and second button
01:17 - is to login so I will
01:19 - say
01:21 - login and let me change the font size so
01:25 - you can see I will select all
01:28 - the controls and I will go to
01:34 - fonts and I will change it to B
01:39 - 16 okay so now what I'm going to do is
01:45 - I'm going
01:46 - to take a web browser so that we can
01:51 - verify that we have really logged into
01:54 - uh into particular website okay so I
01:59 - will take a web browser here I can drop
02:02 - into the form and let me resize
02:07 - it okay now first of all I will use this
02:12 - open web button to open a website in
02:16 - your web browser so just double click
02:19 - this button and in here just
02:27 - write web browser one which is the name
02:30 - of your web
02:33 - browser
02:36 - dot
02:38 - navigate and in the bracket just
02:42 - pass the URL of the website which you
02:46 - want to open so for example I want to
02:48 - log into
02:50 - Facebook or log into to my Facebook
02:53 - account using visual Basics so I will
02:56 - open this www.
03:00 - facebook.com just copy the URL from
03:04 - here and in the double
03:09 - codes just paste
03:11 - your Facebook URL
03:14 - okay now this will open the Facebook of
03:19 - website in your web browser okay now in
03:24 - the second button just double click the
03:27 - second button and in here we are going
03:31 - to get
03:35 - our website and take the ID of the login
03:41 - and username text boxes so let's see how
03:46 - can we do
03:48 - it so here just write once again web
03:51 - browser which is the name of your web
03:54 - browser in my case web browser one dot
04:01 - document
04:03 - dot get element by ID and in the
04:09 - brackets what we are going to do is we
04:11 - are going to pass the ID of the username
04:15 - and password so just give double codes
04:18 - here and how we can find the ID of this
04:23 - text box and this text box what you need
04:25 - to do is just rightclick your uh browser
04:29 - and
04:30 - and and on the same page you need to
04:33 - right click and just click view page in
04:37 - Source or view page Source okay and this
04:41 - will open the source of your web page
04:47 - which is a HTML and JavaScript and all
04:50 - source code of the website now in order
04:53 - to search for uh login and password
04:58 - just control F just click contrl F which
05:02 - will open this find option in Chrome or
05:06 - any other browser and in here you can
05:09 - see email or phone so we can search this
05:13 - text box by email or phone so just write
05:17 - email in the
05:20 - find in this find
05:23 - uh text box in here and you can see here
05:28 - we find email
05:30 - or phone here okay and we want to find
05:36 - the ID of this text box
05:40 - which will contain emails so here is uh
05:45 - the ID of this text box which is email
05:49 - itself so I will just copy this from
05:52 - here so you need to copy the ID right so
05:57 - first is login ID your username which is
06:00 - email in this
06:03 - Facebook and I will paste it here and
06:07 - then I will just say
06:11 - dot set
06:14 - attribute and I want to set
06:17 - attribute which is called
06:22 - value and second option or second
06:25 - argument will be the text which we are
06:28 - taking from the user the name textbox
06:30 - right so we will
06:32 - say textbox
06:35 - one
06:37 - dot text okay so the name of my user
06:44 - name text box is textbox one that's why
06:46 - I have WR written text box okay in the
06:49 - same way I will
06:52 - just copy this uh code and I will just
06:57 - paste it on the
07:00 - this first line and now I just need to
07:04 - change the ID of the password so let's
07:08 - see what is the ID of the password and
07:11 - if you see here
07:13 - carefully we will we will be able to
07:15 - find the ID of the password which is
07:17 - this one ID is equal to pass okay so the
07:21 - ID of the password is pass in
07:24 - Facebook okay I will paste it
07:28 - here and and this will remain same but
07:31 - the text box which we are using is now
07:37 - textbox 2 for the password okay so just
07:40 - write these two
07:42 - lines and now let's see if it works or
07:48 - not our code is not finished but let's
07:52 - see if we are able to set the values so
07:55 - I will first of all I will just open the
07:57 - website by clicking this open
08:03 - web and it opens this Facebook website
08:07 - right and I will type some
08:11 - random username and password and let's
08:13 - see if it sets to these text boxes or
08:17 - not so I will click
08:19 - login and you can see password is set
08:23 - here and username inside here whatever
08:25 - we write here okay and now we are going
08:29 - to change the type of text we will enter
08:33 - into this password text box because we
08:36 - don't want to show our password to the
08:39 - other viewers right so let's cancel it
08:43 - and go to your form and just select your
08:47 - password textbox field and go to the
08:51 - properties and search for the property
08:53 - called password
08:56 - care so this is password care and
08:59 - whatever character you will enter here
09:02 - it will replace the real text by this
09:04 - character so for example I want to so
09:07 - show this dollar symbol instead of my
09:11 - password so whatever password I will
09:14 - write it will replace all the character
09:16 - of the password by this dollar symbol
09:19 - okay so it will protect my password now
09:23 - the third and last line of code which we
09:27 - are going to write here
09:30 - is we want to login or we want to be
09:34 - able to press the login button somehow
09:36 - right so what we are going to do
09:40 - is so once again we will write web
09:44 - browser one which is the name of our web
09:46 - browser dot
09:49 - document. getet element by
09:53 - ID and this time we are going to search
09:56 - for the login button ID okay okay so in
10:00 - double codes let's search for the login
10:03 - button ID so once again when we see
10:06 - carefully here the IDE of login button
10:11 - is login button itself you see
10:14 - here and just copy this login button ID
10:18 - from here and paste it
10:22 - here and then what we are going to write
10:25 - here is just after that just write
10:30 - dot
10:33 - invoke
10:35 - member
10:36 - dot not dot but what uh member we are
10:41 - going to invoke is we want to click this
10:44 - button so we will
10:45 - write click okay so just write this
10:51 - line and these are all the lines we want
10:55 - to write now let's try and and see
11:00 - whether it really works or not so I have
11:04 - this program running and I will give my
11:07 - username of my Facebook
11:20 - [Music]
11:27 - account and I will give the
11:34 - password and first of all I will open
11:37 - that Facebook page by this open web
11:41 - which will open the Facebook page you
11:44 - see here and right now it's empty and
11:47 - when I click this uh login
11:50 - button you see it enters
11:53 - the username and password and it opens
11:56 - my Facebook page
11:59 - okay
12:01 - so you can always go to my Facebook page
12:04 - which is programming knowledge and you
12:08 - can give me a friend friend request or
12:11 - join my pages so I hope you have enjoyed
