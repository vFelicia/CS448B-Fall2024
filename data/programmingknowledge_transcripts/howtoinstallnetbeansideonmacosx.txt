00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - NetBeans IDE on your Mac OS X operating
00:06 - system so the prerequisite of installing
00:11 - NetBeans IDE is to have Java installed
00:15 - on your Mac OS X operating system so
00:18 - first you need to make sure that you
00:20 - have already installed Java on your Mac
00:24 - operating system now the simple check to
00:27 - test that Java is already installed is
00:30 - by going to the system preferences so
00:34 - just click this item which is for System
00:37 - Preferences or just go at the top and
00:40 - click on the Apple icon and then you can
00:43 - open the System Preferences from there
00:45 - also now in the system preferences you
00:48 - will be able to see this kind of Java
00:51 - icon and this means that Java is already
00:54 - installed on your Mac operating system
00:56 - and if it's not you need to install it
00:59 - first and then follow this video to
01:02 - install NetBeans now I have already made
01:06 - a video on how to install Java on your

01:59 - download with different features so you
02:02 - have the NetBeans IDE with Java SE
02:07 - support or Java EE support or if you
02:10 - just want to develop some
02:12 - HTML and JavaScript code you can just

06:39 - going to just
06:40 - go to file here so go at the top and
06:43 - click file and then click new project

06:58 - application and then click Next
07:01 - as going to activate the java @e and
07:06 - once it's done you can give the name to
07:10 - your java project for example this is
07:12 - our hallo world project so i'm going to
07:15 - name it as hello world and this is the
07:19 - location where you can save your project
07:21 - by default its user power slash whatever
07:25 - you your username forward slash NetBeans
07:27 - project and if you want to change it you
07:30 - can browse the directory in which you
07:33 - want to save your project I will leave
07:35 - it as default because it's our first
07:37 - hello world project and then the project
07:40 - folder is this one I will leave it as
07:43 - default also and then in the next step
07:46 - you can see use dedicated folder for
07:50 - storing libraries we don't need it and
07:52 - then the last option here says create
07:55 - main class right so we need the main
07:59 - class for this so leave this as checked
08:02 - and we just need to click finish here
08:04 - it's going to create our project and
08:07 - once the project is created we will be
08:10 - able to see our project so our project
08:13 - has been created you can see and I can
08:15 - see this HelloWorld dot Java here and
08:20 - this is our project so you can just open
08:24 - it it contains source packages directory
08:27 - and the libraries directory here so here
08:31 - is your HelloWorld package and in the
08:36 - hollow world package you have this
08:37 - HelloWorld dot Java file which is open
08:40 - here right and this has already created
08:42 - a HelloWorld class for us and it has
08:47 - already created this public static void
08:50 - main
08:51 - third for us right if you know Java is
08:54 - all about classes and main method is the
08:57 - main entry point for your program
09:00 - so let's print something let's say we
09:03 - want to print hello world so I'm going
09:05 - to just write system dot out dot print
09:10 - line okay so just write print Ln for
09:15 - print line right and in the brackets you
09:18 - just need to give double quotes and then
