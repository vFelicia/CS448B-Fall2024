00:01 - hello guys in this video I will show you
00:03 - how to add a splash screen with your
00:05 - Visual Basic Windows Form application so
00:08 - what is a splash screen it's a first
00:13 - window which appears uh which tells you
00:16 - about the software version copyrights or
00:20 - something about logo and I will show you
00:23 - and then you will come to know how what
00:26 - is a splash screen if you don't know
00:28 - already so let's get started I have a
00:31 - sample project which is a blank project
00:34 - created in Visual Basic and for example
00:37 - I add some combo box and other buttons
00:44 - and check box list and other things and
00:48 - this is the functionality of my form now
00:50 - I want to add a splash screen to this
00:54 - project so what I need to do is I need
00:57 - to go to the project in solution
00:59 - solution Explorer so go to solution
01:02 - Explorer and then select your project
01:04 - and right click it and go to add and
01:08 - click add new
01:11 - items and in
01:15 - here we need to search
01:18 - for spash screen here it is so this is a
01:24 - splash screen just select the splash
01:26 - screen and add it to your project once
01:30 - you click add button the splash screen
01:32 - will be added to your uh uh project and
01:36 - in here you can change
01:40 - the background image or you can change
01:43 - the title for example I will change the
01:46 - title here and I will name it
01:49 - as my
01:54 - cool project for example and now when I
01:58 - run the program
02:04 - you will see first of
02:08 - all splash screen should appear so how
02:12 - to add this splash screen to your
02:15 - project once again
02:17 - just go to your project and right click
02:20 - it and go to the
02:25 - properties and in here in the properties
02:27 - you will find a property called splash
02:30 - screen which by default is none you need
02:33 - to select splash screen one which is a
02:35 - splash screen which we have
02:38 - created and just you just need to do
02:42 - that right and now when you run the
02:46 - program uh splash screen will appear
02:48 - first which tells the project name and
02:51 - all and now your project will come in
02:56 - front
02:57 - right so in this way you can change
03:02 - these Texs and these um background image
03:05 - for example I want to change the
03:06 - background image of my splash screen I
03:10 - can just select my splash screen and go
03:13 - to background image and I can select any
03:17 - image from the local resource I will
03:19 - select
03:21 - import and I
03:23 - will I can select any image from my
03:28 - local resource so I selected a
03:32 - image and I click okay and you see the
03:36 - image is changed here or for example I
03:40 - want to change the font color or four
03:44 - color of this
03:52 - um label so I will make it white so we
03:57 - can see it and and I will just make it
04:01 - white this
04:03 - also okay and now when I run the
04:08 - program my customized splash screen
04:12 - appears and then my project appears so
04:16 - this is the simple way you can create a
04:18 - splash screen with your Visual Basic
04:21 - project there are
04:23 - Advanced splash screen which I will uh
04:26 - show you in the later videos but for now
04:29 - now this is uh the basic format of
04:32 - splash screen which you can add to your
04:35 - Visual Basic I hope you have enjoyed
