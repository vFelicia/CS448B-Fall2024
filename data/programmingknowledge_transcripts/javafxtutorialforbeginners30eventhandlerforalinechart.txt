00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners in the
00:05 - last two videos I have been showing you
00:06 - how to use line chart in Java FX now in
00:10 - this video I'm going to show you how you
00:12 - can handle some event when you click on
00:17 - these points on your line charts for
00:20 - example you want to show the value of x
00:24 - AIS and y axis when you click on these
00:27 - points how you can do it let's see so
00:31 - I'm going to use the same example which
00:33 - I have been you using in uh the last two
00:36 - videos and uh this was the code so right
00:40 - now our uh line chart has only one line
00:44 - which is using this series okay and I'm
00:48 - using uh the series to the line chart
00:50 - using line chart. getet data. add all
00:54 - series okay now after uh this uh code in
01:00 - inside my button click method what I'm
01:03 - going to do is first of all I'm going to
01:05 - create a for Loop and inside the for
01:09 - Loop I'm going to use final X
01:14 - chart here and then dot data and it's
01:19 - going to use these two template
01:21 - arguments same as your
01:23 - series and name it as uh data for
01:27 - example okay and then uh you can take
01:30 - your series and then extract the data
01:34 - from it it so just use get data and this
01:40 - is going to give you the series data
01:44 - okay now just use this uh data and then
01:50 - call a method called get node on it and
01:54 - then add a event handler to it okay so
01:58 - event handler it takes two argument
02:01 - first is event type so our event type is
02:05 - for example Mouse click event okay so
02:10 - just use Mouse uh event Dot and then
02:15 - choose this mouse clicked you can uh
02:18 - choose other uh you know events some
02:21 - something like uh Mouse entered or Mouse
02:23 - exited or Mouse moved but for now I'm
02:26 - going to use Mouse clicked okay and then
02:30 - as the event handler you can just write
02:34 - new event handler so just call this uh
02:40 - class from here event handler search for
02:42 - it
02:44 - down and then add it and then you have
02:49 - the event here so this event type is
02:52 - mouse event right so just uh add this
02:55 - mouse event here and then it's going to
02:57 - give you this error which will say add
03:01 - unimplemented method so just add
03:03 - unimplemented method which is going to
03:05 - add this handle method to your code and
03:09 - then you can uh you know show the values
03:13 - of the points on a label so let's create
03:16 - a label first so I will go up here and I
03:20 - will add a label variable so
03:25 - fxml
03:27 - label lbl for example and to this uh
03:31 - label we are going to add some text okay
03:34 - so first add the import for the label
03:37 - and then use this label here dot set
03:42 - text and then you can uh use your uh
03:47 - data
03:48 - variable and then call a method called
03:53 - get x value okay and this is going to
03:57 - give you uh your XX value which is a
04:00 - string okay so it's uh perfectly fine
04:04 - here okay so I will add uh some uh you
04:08 - know uh text before it for example so
04:12 - here I will just write X then colon in
04:18 - the double quotes so just enclose
04:20 - everything in the double quotes and then
04:23 - the plus symbol and then once again this
04:27 - uh double quotes after this plus and
04:31 - then I'm going to change the line using
04:34 - back
04:35 - sln and then I'm going to just write y
04:41 - colon and then the Y AIS value okay but
04:47 - our y AIS value is a number okay so we
04:51 - need to convert this to a number so what
04:55 - we can do is we can just write string
05:00 - dot value of and then here you can just
05:04 - call
05:07 - data and then call your get y value okay
05:14 - so just call get y
05:16 - value and that's it so now one thing
05:20 - which remains is we need to uh add this
05:24 - label ID to our fxml file so open your
05:28 - fxml file which is is this main. fxml
05:31 - file and we are going to add a label
05:34 - here so just uh choose a label from the
05:37 - controls search for this
05:41 - label and you can resize it and you can
05:46 - even change the font size but uh I'm not
05:49 - going to do this I'm just going to
05:51 - change the FX ID of it which is label
05:55 - okay let's uh even change the font size
05:59 - of this lab label okay so no text on the
06:02 - label just change the font size to for
06:06 - example
06:08 - 24 and let's change the color of it to
06:13 - Red also okay so now just uh save
06:17 - everything and then refresh your project
06:21 - right click and refresh and then run
06:24 - your
06:25 - project and uh we will just click this
06:28 - load chart button which will load this
06:31 - chart and whenever I click on some point
06:35 - it's going to print the values so our
06:38 - xais is Gen which we have clicked and
06:43 - the Y AIS is 200 you can see so when you
06:46 - click some other point it will show the
06:50 - value of these points X x-axis and Y AIS
06:54 - here okay now for example you want to uh
06:59 - give the tool tip same tool tip uh when
07:02 - you hover over these points right so
07:06 - what you can do you can add a tool tip
07:09 - uh to your uh line chart let's see how
07:13 - we can add a tool tip so go to your code
07:17 - once again and inside this handle method
07:21 - this time what we are going to do is
07:23 - just below the label code we are going
07:26 - to use tool tip so so just add this tool
07:31 - tip valuable here and then do install so
07:35 - just add this install and it's going to
07:38 - take two method one is uh your node so
07:42 - node you can get it from this uh data
07:45 - variable so data. get node and the
07:48 - second is the tool tip okay so just
07:52 - write here
07:54 - new tool tip and then inside this
07:59 - Constructor you can place the same line
08:03 - of uh text which you have given to uh
08:07 - your label okay so just copy this text
08:10 - and paste it here okay and save your
08:13 - code and run it once
08:16 - again and load your
08:18 - chart and when I click uh this uh Point
08:23 - here it's going to show uh this value
08:25 - here and when I hover over this point
08:28 - it's going to show this
08:29 - uh tool tip you can see here in Black
08:33 - right so when I hover over the second
08:35 - point it's going to uh give me the
08:38 - second tool tip okay and here just click
08:43 - it and then it's going to give me the
08:46 - tool tip right so because I have added
08:50 - this tool tip inside the mouse click
08:53 - event so I need to click the mouse first
08:56 - on the point and then uh it's going to
08:59 - give the tool tip if uh you want to uh
09:02 - you know uh change it you can change it
09:05 - to Mouse entered or Mouse hovered or any
09:08 - other event okay so in this way you can
09:11 - add event to your line chart I hope you
