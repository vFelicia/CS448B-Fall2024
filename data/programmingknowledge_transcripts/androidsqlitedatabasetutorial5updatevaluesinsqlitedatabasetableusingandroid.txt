00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Android SQLite database tutorial for
00:05 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:08 - how we can update data in SQLite
00:11 - database using our Android app till now
00:16 - we have seen how to insert data into the
00:18 - SQLite database and how to view it and
00:22 - let's add one more button here and this
00:26 - button we are going to use to update the
00:28 - data so I am going to change the name as
00:31 - update and one more thing we want to do
00:34 - is if you remember our database table
00:36 - contains four columns first one was ID
00:41 - second one was name surname and the
00:44 - maths code by the student right and to
00:48 - update the data we need our unique
00:52 - reference of the row so that we can you
00:56 - know tell SQLite that we want to delete
01:00 - the data from this row particular row
01:04 - right because names can be same so if
01:09 - you want to change the name of one
01:12 - person which shares the name with the
01:15 - other person then the data can be
01:17 - changed for both the names if you don't
01:20 - know what is the unique you know row or
01:25 - unique column in this
01:27 - okay so ID we have defined as a unique
01:32 - column for this database table so what
01:37 - I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly
01:39 - add this ID text view and you know added
01:44 - text so that we can enter the ID also so
01:47 - now I have added this ID added text and
01:50 - text view here right now we are good to
01:55 - go
01:55 - so next thing you need to do is we need
01:59 - to create a function in our database
02:02 - helper dot Java class which we have
02:05 - created in the last videos so let's go
02:08 - to database helper dot Java file and in
02:13 - here till now
02:13 - we have created insert data and get all
02:16 - that ax functions right we will create
02:19 - one more function here and we will call
02:21 - it as update data okay so it will be
02:27 - public and we'll return boolean so we
02:30 - need to know if the data is really
02:32 - updated or not so we are going to return
02:35 - boolean and we say this function name is
02:40 - update data okay arguments it's going to
02:47 - take is it's going to take four
02:50 - arguments 1st argument we are going to
02:54 - pass here will be string ID 2nd is the
03:02 - string name so basically I want to pass
03:06 - all the four column data to it because
03:11 - our table contains four columns ID name
03:14 - surname and Marx right so I am going to
03:18 - pass all the four column data I am going
03:21 - to take it from added text and pass it
03:24 - in this function right now in here what
03:27 - we are going to do is as we have done in
03:29 - the insert data function first of all we
03:32 - will create a SQLite database instance
03:35 - so I am going to copy this from here to
03:38 - here and second we are going to create
03:41 - an instance of content value okay
03:46 - so let's create that and then as we have
03:51 - done in this insert data function that
03:55 - we were putting whatever data is passed
03:59 - from the argument to this content
04:03 - content value using put right so let's
04:09 - do it
04:09 - and one more column we need to add here
04:12 - and this will be for column 1 right this
04:18 - will be column 1 and its IV in our case
04:22 - right because this contains extra ID
04:27 - here now
04:27 - the only difference in this function and
04:31 - the insert data function is the method
04:35 - we are going to use now so just take
04:37 - your database instance now and then call
04:41 - update here and this update will update
04:46 - your date whatever argument you pass
04:48 - here first argument it takes is the name
04:51 - of your table okay so give the name of
04:54 - your table this is our table name if you
04:57 - remember we have declared table name
04:59 - here right so first argument is the
05:03 - table name right second is the content
05:08 - value so it takes second argument as
05:11 - content value so we take this instance
05:15 - of content value and pass it here third
05:19 - argument is the condition which we want
05:22 - to pass here so what we want to do we
05:26 - want to update data on the basis of for
05:29 - example ID because ID is our unique
05:33 - primary key here and on the basis of
05:35 - primary key we can differentiate data so
05:38 - in here we will write ID is equal to
05:42 - question so we will you know ask
05:45 - whatever ID is passed using this ID
05:50 - parameter we are going to query this and
05:53 - fourth is the value on the basis of
05:55 - which we want to update our data so this
05:58 - is the column name on the basis of which
06:02 - we want to update the data and our
06:04 - column name is ID so you can just write
06:07 - here column name ID is equal to question
06:10 - mark and then in here fourth argument
06:14 - let's go inside this update so just
06:17 - hover over ctrl and click and see it
06:20 - takes the fourth argument as the string
06:23 - array right so we will go back and pass
06:28 - string array here right so we can just
06:33 - write here in the curly braces we just
06:36 - pass our ID and we want to pass
06:41 - new instance so new string ID okay
06:46 - and if everything goes well we want to
06:51 - return return true to know that if the
06:58 - data is really updated or not now this
07:02 - is done so what we are going to do is we
07:05 - are going to move to our main activity
07:07 - dot Java file and in here we will
07:10 - declare one more button variable which
07:14 - will be our button for updating so
07:19 - button update okay and then we are going
07:25 - to take this button instance and we will
07:29 - cast it as a button using the ID so the
07:34 - idea of this button is button itself
07:37 - right now so let's change the ID to
07:39 - button underscore update or something
07:42 - like this button underscore update so we
07:48 - know that this button is for update
07:50 - right then we will go to main activity
07:53 - load Java you already had declared our
07:56 - button for updating so take this button
08:01 - go to your oncreate method whether you
08:04 - have typecasted all other tools or
08:08 - widgets is equal to button so we have
08:13 - done casting this button and now we are
08:17 - going to create a function and this
08:19 - function will be public I am going to
08:21 - declare this function here itself void
08:26 - update data for example it's not going
08:30 - to take any argument and inside this
08:33 - function what we are going to do is we
08:36 - are going to take this button and call
08:39 - set onclicklistener
08:41 - on it so not set on click listener and
08:45 - inside this new on click listener and
08:50 - inside this we just need to our call
08:55 - our update function from our database
09:00 - helper so this was update function the
09:04 - name was little bit wrong so let's
09:07 - update make it update function right and
09:11 - now what we are going to do is in our
09:14 - main activity dot Java file inside this
09:18 - on click method we will declare a
09:21 - boolean to check if the data is updated
09:23 - and we will name it as is updated is
09:29 - equal to and now we are going to take
09:31 - about my database instance which we have
09:34 - created in our previous videos from our
09:38 - database helper class right so my DB dot
09:43 - update data and now this update data
09:47 - function takes four argument as we know
09:49 - ID name surname and age right and in
09:54 - here we need to declare one more added
09:57 - text variable for ID because we have
10:01 - created this new added text here which
10:04 - is added text ID so let's create one
10:08 - more variable for added text in our main
10:11 - activity dot Java file so let's add for
10:15 - example added text for ID okay and then
10:23 - we take this added text and add to our
10:28 - on create method and we will cast it
10:32 - same as we have done for other added
10:35 - text in the previous videos but the ID
10:38 - here will be for added text ID right so
10:42 - edit text ID right and now we can take
10:48 - this added text ID and pass it in our
10:51 - update data method here dot get text
10:57 - right so it will take the text from the
11:00 - edit text and it will pass to this
11:03 - function same we will do for all of our
11:06 - other
11:08 - added text which was for name surname
11:11 - and marks
11:19 - and the reason why it's showing error
11:22 - because we need to convert this get text
11:25 - to strengths right so dot to string okay
11:31 - add this to other variables also
11:36 - so basically what we have done we have
11:39 - called our update data function and we
11:43 - have passed whatever we are getting from
11:45 - added text right now if this function
11:52 - returns true which is update data then
11:56 - so we will check if up is update is
12:03 - equal to true then what we are going to
12:09 - do we are going to show some message
12:14 - right so we can take these messages from
12:18 - our last video by the way in the last
12:20 - video I forgot to give this double equal
12:23 - to so when we are checking equality we
12:26 - need double equal to
12:28 - so single equal to we need in case of
12:32 - assigning the values right so I am going
12:34 - to copy these messages from here and I
12:39 - am going to paste it here okay so now we
12:45 - will say data is updated or data is not
12:51 - updated in case if it returns false
12:56 - the data are not updated okay now just
13:02 - copy this function and paste it inside
13:05 - our on create method so that it can be
13:08 - called when this oncreate method is
13:11 - called and now we are ready to run our
13:15 - program so let's run it so now our
13:17 - program is running and we can see when
13:20 - we click this view all button which we
13:23 - have created in the last video that we
13:25 - have two rows of data one is ID 1 and
13:30 - name is mark and surname is dancer and
13:33 - second is tom right for example I want
13:37 - to update the first letter of the name
13:40 - mouth
13:41 - I want capital M here instead of small m
13:44 - and same I want to do for this Benson
13:48 - here right so what we are going
13:50 - to do we are going to just write the
13:53 - name here so I have corrected the
13:55 - spelling or in the name instead of small
13:58 - MI for added capital lemons instead of
14:01 - small be added capital B and other
14:05 - things remain same marks remain same and
14:09 - if you remember the ID of this name mark
14:13 - is 1 this is important here because on
14:16 - the basis of ID we are editing the data
14:19 - right and now we can click this update
14:22 - button just click this update and it
14:26 - says data updated okay so let's check
14:29 - the data once again by view all and now
14:32 - you can see the mark name mark with the
14:36 - capital m and the surname Benson with
14:40 - capital B so our data is updated
14:43 - successfully right so in this way you
14:47 - can update the data in the SQLite
14:50 - database using your Android app I hope
