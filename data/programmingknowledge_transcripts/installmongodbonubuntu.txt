03:31 - by writing CD and in my home
03:36 - folder what I will do I will make a
03:41 - directory
03:43 - called sud
03:49 - sudo make
03:52 - directory
03:54 - slash
03:56 - data okay press enter
04:01 - it will ask for your
04:04 - password and
04:07 - it's already there and the next step in
04:11 - my data directory which I have created
04:16 - in this step in the last step I will
04:19 - make uh one more
04:22 - folder called di so what I will do
04:28 - sudo
04:34 - MK and then slash
04:37 - data/
04:40 - DB okay and press
04:45 - enter so till now what I have done is I
04:48 - have downloaded mongod
04:51 - DB's zip file for Linux from mongodb
04:55 - site through command line I have
04:58 - extracted that that file into my home
05:01 - folder I have made made one directory
05:06 - called data
05:08 - and in data directory I have made one
05:11 - more directory called
05:14 - DB now I
05:19 - will go to
05:23 - that data folder because it's in
05:28 - my root folder I will have
05:32 - to give the permissions so I will
05:36 - write
05:39 - Pudo CH mode
05:44 - 777 SL
05:47 - data slash star just write that command
05:52 - and
05:54 - press
05:57 - enter okay now now the next step is to
06:01 - go to my
06:05 -  folder which I
06:09 - have extracted in my home directory
06:12 - which is this
06:14 - one which I have downloaded in the first
06:17 - two steps so I will go to
06:23 - directory and
06:25 - then in
06:27 - here I will write
06:30 - dot
06:32 - slash
06:36 - D to start mongod
06:39 - DB server and I will press
06:42 - [Music]
06:48 - enter okay it's not present there
06:51 - so I will go to bin folder of that
06:55 - mongod DB so right CD bin
07:00 - in and then press
07:02 - enter so I have gone to mongod DB folder
07:07 - and
07:08 - then in mongod DB folder I have gone to
07:12 - bin folder and then I will execute do/
07:18 - mongod command and I will press
07:25 - enter
07:27 - and now what is
07:30 - says cannot execute binary file
07:38 - y I will try for mongod
07:42 - D accept this dot slash so only mongod D
07:48 - and I will try to run this
07:52 - command
07:54 - and yeah so it says that I have to
08:00 - install
08:02 - this command install mongod D server in
08:07 - order to start the server so it
08:11 - says is currently not installed so
08:15 - install installation installation step
08:19 - is given here Pudo app get install
08:24 - DB server so I will copy
08:28 - it
08:30 - and I will paste
08:33 - it here and I will press
08:37 - enter which will install mongod DB
08:41 - server into my system and then I will
08:44 - press yes to go
08:57 - further and it will
08:59 - install mongod DB server into my
09:02 - system so what it do is when
09:07 - you start your Ubuntu the mongod DV
09:11 - server will start automatically and you
09:14 - don't need to start it from
09:18 - separate command so it's the advantage
09:21 - of this mongod DV server
09:28 - installation
09:33 - so my mongodb server is
09:37 - installed and now I will start my
09:43 - database so what I will do is I will
09:46 - open a new terminal which I have already
09:51 - opened and once again I will go
09:58 - to
10:04 - my mongod DB
10:11 - folder which is
10:17 - this I will copy it to save the time so
10:21 - I will write
10:24 - CD mongod db- Linux D x86
10:30 - 64 version 2.0.1 SL bin so I want to go
10:35 - into mongod DB folder and then in that
10:40 - mongod DB folder I go to bin directory
10:45 - and I will
10:47 - press
10:52 - enter and it
10:58 - says
11:01 - there is no such directory so I think I
11:09 - have created some mistakes so I
11:12 - will just copy CD command once
11:16 - again which I
11:20 - have executed earlier let me paste it
11:24 - here and run once again yes it's go goes
11:29 - to mongod DB and then I will go to bin
11:33 - folder CD
11:36 - bin and it goes to
11:38 - bin and in here you need to uh execute a
11:44 - command
11:45 - called earlier we have executed
11:49 - mongod D to start the server and this
11:54 - time we will execute a command only
11:57 -  to start the database and I will
12:01 - press
12:03 - enter okay it cannot execute so I will
12:07 - try to write only
12:10 -  and I will enter once again yes so
12:15 - you can see if you see this mongod DV
12:18 - shell version and connected to test it
12:23 - means it
12:25 - has started your database and now you
12:28 - can then
12:30 - write your database entries here so for
12:36 - example I want to
12:44 - use
12:46 - tutorial so it it has switched to
12:50 - tutorial
12:53 - okay and for example I want to
12:57 - execute DB
13:01 - tutorial
13:03 - do
13:04 - [Music]
13:06 - find press
13:08 - enter and there's nothing in my tutorial
13:12 - so I can insert new
13:15 - values in
13:21 - my
13:23 - database so this was uh the procedure to
13:27 - install mongod DB into
13:30 - your 122.0 operating system in future I
13:34 - will also
13:36 - show how
13:38 - to run C++
13:44 - drivers usingubuntu operating system in
13:48 - Eclipse so how you can access
13:52 - database using C++
13:54 - program I will show you in the future
