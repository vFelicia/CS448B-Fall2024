00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - code blocks ide on your windows 11
00:06 - operating system
00:08 - so code blocks is one of the most
00:11 - popular ides for developing c or c plus
00:13 - plus programs so let's see how we can
00:15 - install it so first of all open your
00:17 - favorite browser and search for code
00:19 - blocks and the first link which will
00:21 - appear here will be from
00:22 - codeblocks.org so we are going to click
00:24 - on this link
00:26 - and if you are not
00:28 - directly redirected to the codeblocks
00:31 - downloads
00:32 - page you can click on the downloads link
00:36 - on the left hand side
00:38 - and you will reach to this
00:40 - web page
00:41 - now in here you need to click on the
00:44 - download the binary release link
00:47 - and then on the next page you can scroll
00:49 - down where you will see the microsoft
00:52 - windows section
00:54 - and we want to install code blocks with
00:57 - mingw compiler
01:00 - so we are going to select this link
01:02 - which says code blocks and the version
01:05 - at the time of making this video the
01:08 - latest version is 20.03
01:11 - and which also includes the name mingw
01:15 - setup right
01:16 - so what it's going to do is it's going
01:18 - to
01:19 - install the code blocks with mingw mingw
01:22 - is a compiler which will help you to
01:24 - compile and run your
01:26 - coc plus programs that's why we want to
01:29 - install code blocks with mingw
01:33 - so you can select any a link in front of
01:37 - this mingw setup i'm going to select the
01:40 - sourceforge.net
01:42 - link which is going to start the
01:44 - download
01:45 - of this exe file
01:48 - so just wait for this download to
01:50 - complete so once this executable file is
01:53 - downloaded we are going to click on this
01:55 - executable file and i'm going to
01:56 - minimize the browser and first of all
01:58 - you will see this warning which says do
02:00 - you want to allow this app from unknown
02:02 - publisher to make changes on your device
02:05 - i trust this app so i'm going to click
02:07 - on yes here
02:09 - and it's going to start the installation
02:12 - of code blocks on your windows operating
02:14 - system so on the first window you just
02:16 - need to click on the next button and
02:18 - here you will see the license terms and
02:20 - conditions so if you agree with the
02:22 - license terms and conditions click on i
02:24 - agree
02:25 - and then code blocks is going to
02:28 - install all these things on your windows
02:31 - operating system so just leave
02:33 - everything as default and then click on
02:34 - next and this will be the location where
02:37 - code blocks will be installed so if you
02:39 - don't have the good reason to change
02:41 - this location just leave it as default
02:44 - and then click on next which is going to
02:46 - start the installation process so at
02:48 - this point you just need to wait for
02:50 - this progress bar to reach to the 100
02:52 - mark so i'm going to wait for that
02:55 - and now at the end
02:56 - code blocks is going to ask you do you
02:58 - want to run code blocks now i'm going to
03:01 - click on yes here
03:03 - which is going to complete the
03:05 - installation process you can see the
03:07 - installation process has been completed
03:09 - so i'm going to click on next here
03:11 - and then i'm going to click on finish
03:14 - and because we have
03:16 - just clicked that button which is going
03:18 - to launch this code blocks and also you
03:21 - will be able to see this window which
03:24 - says
03:24 - gnu gcc compiler detected so because we
03:28 - have downloaded the code blocks with
03:31 - mingw setup that's why you can see the
03:34 - compiler is gcc compiler and the status
03:37 - here is detected you can click on ok
03:40 - here and now you can see that codeblocks
03:43 - ide has been launched and you might also
03:45 - see this warning which says code blocks
03:47 - is currently not the default application
03:49 - for cnc plus plus source files if you
03:52 - want to create the associations you can
03:55 - click on these radio buttons but for now
03:58 - i'm going to leave it as default and
04:00 - then click on ok and first of all you
04:02 - can also see that this code blocks
04:05 - shortcut icon is also created on my
04:07 - desktop so now let's create a very
04:09 - simple c plus program on our code blocks
04:12 - ide and let's see whether it's working
04:15 - or not
04:16 - so to create a new project click on file
04:19 - then new
04:20 - and then click on project
04:22 - and from here you can choose different
04:24 - kind of projects
04:26 - so we want to create a console
04:28 - application so i'm going to click on
04:30 - console application and then click on ok
04:33 - and then i'm going to click on next here
04:36 - and then here we can choose the language
04:38 - c or c plus plus i'm going to choose c
04:40 - plus plus and then click on next and
04:42 - then you can provide the project
04:44 - name so i'm going to name my project as
04:46 - hello
04:48 - world here
04:49 - and you can choose the folder where you
04:52 - want to save your project so i'm going
04:54 - to save my project
04:56 - on
04:57 - my documents folder
04:59 - and also you will be able to see the
05:02 - resulting
05:04 - file name here
05:05 - which will be inside the folder which
05:08 - you have selected here i'm going to
05:10 - click on next here
05:11 - and then you can
05:13 - select the compiler from this list and
05:16 - in our case we need to choose a gnu gcc
05:19 - compiler which was automatically
05:21 - detected and then click on finish
05:24 - and it's going to create a very simple
05:27 - program for us so you can see
05:31 - there is a source folder and inside the
05:33 - source folder we have this main.cpp file
05:37 - and there is this very simple hello
05:40 - world c plus plus program here
05:42 - so in order to run this program first of
05:45 - all you need to compile that or build
05:47 - this program
05:49 - and to build this program you can click
05:51 - on this build icon here so when you
05:53 - click on the build icon your program
05:56 - will be built and if the build is
05:59 - successful you can see zero errors here
06:02 - then you can run it so you can click on
06:05 - this run button in order to run this
06:07 - program and you can see it runs this
06:10 - program and prints hello world which was
06:13 - the output which we want to print in
06:17 - this console application so everything
06:20 - is working fine and from now on you can
06:23 - start using code blocks for
06:25 - building your c or c plus plus programs
06:29 - so in this way you can download and
06:30 - install code blocks on your windows 11
06:33 - operating system i hope you've enjoyed
06:35 - this video and i will see you in the
06:37 - next video
