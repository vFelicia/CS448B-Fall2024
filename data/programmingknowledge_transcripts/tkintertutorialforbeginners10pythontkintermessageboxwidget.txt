00:01 - hey everyone today we're gonna talk
00:03 - about message box and thinker so without
00:06 - declaring a new screen you can have fun
00:08 - but its functionalities are limited so
00:11 - let's check what I'm actually talking
00:13 - about basically I will declare buttons
00:15 - and the commands would contain functions
00:18 - that call the message boxes we can have
00:20 - many types of message box as per our
00:23 - requirement we can have the show info
00:25 - show warning show error ask question ask
00:29 - okay cancel ask yes no ask retry cancel
00:33 - these all are functions available in the
00:36 - message box module now we'll check them
00:39 - one by one let's get started so I'll
00:42 - write
00:43 - from tincter
00:45 - import Star and also from Tinker
00:51 - import message box
00:54 - you need to import this message box
00:57 - module separately and then I'll get the
01:00 - window I'll write win equals TK
01:04 - brackets and I'll also given a title
01:07 - I'll write when dot title
01:10 - let the title be message box
01:15 - and then I'll also specify the size of
01:18 - the screen so I'll write win dot
01:20 - geometry
01:22 - 400 cross 400 in double quotes so that's
01:26 - how you can specify the size of the
01:29 - screen
01:30 - this is a new thing
01:32 - then we will Define the functions one by
01:34 - one they would be giving us command for
01:36 - each button so first of all I'll use the
01:39 - show info function so I'll write
01:42 - deaf show info
01:46 - kids
01:48 - and I'll write message box
01:50 - dot show info
01:54 - so the first string would be the heading
01:56 - of the message box so I'll write
01:58 - important
02:00 - because this is just an information and
02:03 - for the message
02:05 - I'll write this might
02:08 - take a minute
02:12 - okay
02:14 - then similarly I'll Define some more
02:16 - functions I'll write something for
02:20 - show error so I'll write Def
02:24 - error
02:26 - and
02:27 - message box dot show error
02:33 - the title would be error
02:37 - and the message would be the specified
02:42 - path
02:43 - it is not exist
02:46 - because this is an error you can given
02:49 - any messages as per
02:51 - requirement then I'll have something for
02:54 - ask question I'll write def
02:57 - Q
03:00 - message box dot ask question
03:06 - and I'll write title h
03:11 - and the message would be are you 13
03:14 - years
03:16 - old or above
03:19 - question mark so an ask question
03:22 - function you'll have two options to
03:24 - select from yes or no
03:26 - and accordingly you can select then I'll
03:29 - Define for ask OK or cancel I'll write
03:33 - def cancel
03:36 - you can name the function anything
03:39 - is just what function you call
03:42 - then I'll write message box start ask
03:45 - okay cancel
03:48 - and let the title be delete
03:52 - and message PR you sure you want to
03:58 - delete
04:01 - question mark
04:02 - then I'll have the function yes no
04:05 - so I'll write Def
04:09 - yes no
04:11 - rackets and I'll call the ask yes no
04:14 - function write message box
04:18 - dot ask
04:20 - yes no
04:21 - and let the title be confirmation
04:26 - and the message B are
04:29 - you sure
04:31 - you want
04:33 - to proceed
04:38 - so ask yes now also gives you two
04:41 - options to select from yes and no so you
04:44 - might think that ask yes no and ask
04:46 - question functions are same but they're
04:48 - not the ask question returns yes or no
04:51 - string but the ask yes no function
04:55 - returns a Boolean true for yes and false
04:59 - for no
05:00 - okay then you also have the ask free try
05:03 - cancel so I'll Define a function for
05:05 - that too I'll write Def retry
05:09 - now for this function you will have two
05:11 - options to select from retry and cancel
05:15 - now if you click on retry
05:18 - this ask retry cancel function returns
05:21 - true and if you click on cancel it
05:24 - returns false so just to give you an
05:27 - idea of what is happening I'll declare a
05:31 - variable for this function
05:33 - which will store this Boolean so I'll
05:36 - have R equals
05:38 - message box start ask retry
05:42 - cancel
05:45 - let the title be failure
05:50 - and the message let it be to you
05:54 - want to try
05:56 - again
05:58 - question mark
06:00 - and if
06:02 - R is true
06:04 - f r then I'll print retry
06:10 - I'll simply print redrive on the console
06:12 - and else
06:14 - I'll print cancel
06:20 - then I'll move on to the next function
06:23 - I'll have this show warning function so
06:27 - I'll write F1
06:30 - and message box start show warning
06:36 - let the title be warning in caps
06:42 - and let the message be
06:45 - this might
06:47 - lead
06:49 - to malfunction
06:53 - of the app
06:55 - okay
06:58 - now I have all the functions for all the
07:01 - buttons
07:03 - now I'll declare the buttons one by one
07:05 - and assign them these functions we have
07:07 - seven functions so we'll have seven
07:09 - buttons so let's start
07:14 - B1 equals button
07:18 - and
07:20 - where do I want my button I want it on
07:22 - the window so I'll write win
07:24 - text equals
07:27 - information
07:29 - because first I'll have the show info
07:31 - command so command equals
07:35 - show info
07:37 - background
07:40 - Let It Be
07:43 - sky blue
07:45 - foreground
07:47 - let it be white
07:49 - active background let it be light green
07:55 - then I'll place this button I'll write
07:58 - P1 dot place
08:01 - and x equals 100
08:05 - y equals 100 so I'll simply given a
08:08 - coordinate
08:10 - and similarly I'll have all my buttons
08:13 - so I'll just copy this
08:16 - and edit the next ones
08:20 - so for B2
08:23 - I want it on the screen so I'll write
08:26 - win as Master then text would be error
08:33 - command would also be error
08:38 - and the rest Let It Be same
08:40 - I'll change the coordinates to 100 comma
08:43 - 200. right 200. book
08:47 - then in B3
08:51 - I'll have when text Let It Be retry
08:58 - command would be retry
09:01 - I have my retry function
09:03 - and
09:05 - then let the rest be same let the
09:07 - decoration be same for the button
09:10 - and I'll have the coordinates as 100
09:13 - comma 300 so y would be 300.
09:17 - then again I'll have B4
09:21 - I'll change the text to question
09:25 - command will be q-u-e
09:29 - and I'll change the coordinates
09:32 - to 200 comma 100 so X would be 200.
09:37 - y would be hundred
09:40 - then B5
09:44 - Let It Be cancel
09:48 - command will be cancel
09:51 - and the rest would be same
09:55 - then the x coordinate Let It Be 200. why
09:58 - let it be 200.
10:02 - then I'll have B6
10:06 - text Let It Be yes no
10:11 - yes or no
10:13 - and command Let It Be yes no
10:18 - coordinates will be
10:20 - 200
10:23 - comma 300.
10:27 - then B7
10:30 - let the text be warning
10:36 - command will be warned
10:41 - coordinates will be 300
10:45 - and 100 okay
10:48 - and I'll call in the main Loop
10:51 - all right when dot main Loop
10:57 - I hope there is no confusion the text
11:00 - for buttons is what would be displayed
11:02 - on the buttons the command for the
11:04 - buttons are user defined functions which
11:06 - contain the message box widget functions
11:08 - okay so you should be very clear about
11:10 - all this now let's run this and see the
11:13 - buttons and check out the message boxes
11:16 - how they are popped up on the screen
11:24 - so I have my screen and I can see the
11:27 - buttons as defined and I'll click on
11:29 - each one of them
11:31 - I get a sound too so this important
11:36 - is the title as defined and this might
11:38 - take a minute
11:40 - so this I symbol is there
11:42 - and I have to click on OK because that's
11:45 - the only available option and I have
11:47 - question
11:48 - and there's a question mark symbol I
11:51 - have two options
11:52 - so there are differences in each
11:55 - function
11:57 - and for warning I have an exclamation
11:59 - mark symbol
12:01 - then for cancel I have a question mark
12:04 - again but the options are different I
12:06 - have okay cancel
12:08 - then for retry there is retry cancel
12:12 - and when I click on retry I can see
12:14 - retry printed on the terminal because
12:16 - that's how I defined it
12:18 - now that's pretty much it about the
12:20 - message box widget thank you
