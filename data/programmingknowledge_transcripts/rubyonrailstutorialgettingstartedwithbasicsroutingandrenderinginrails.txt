00:00 - so today we are continuing with our uh
00:02 - continue with the tutorial on rupee on
00:04 - rails
00:05 - so basically today we are going to work
00:07 - with routes in ruby
00:08 - so basically routes in ruby means like
00:10 - url
00:11 - so basically when you create an
00:13 - application you create different urls
00:15 - like for different purposes
00:17 - so we will see how to create some urls
00:19 - in rails
00:20 - and we will start like learn
00:23 - uh what we can process uh after creating
00:25 - a route
00:26 - so basically uh so let's start with our
00:28 - application
00:29 - so very first thing you need to create
00:31 - is like the first thing
00:32 - is like i'll give a quick overview okay
00:37 - since ruby is a mvc framework so m
00:40 - stands for models
00:42 - that is your database so basically this
00:45 - differential database
00:46 - views just like your presentation so
00:49 - basically that is your html
00:51 - and uh like html and front end
00:54 - so basically this is like for your
00:56 - presentation okay
00:58 - uh presentation and uh the another one
01:02 - is controller
01:03 - so controllers are basically used to
01:06 - like
01:07 - uh like basically like it is like based
01:09 - on communicate and navigate between the
01:11 - above two
01:12 - so basically controllers take control
01:16 - uh between uh where like between
01:20 - models and views
01:23 - okay so basically they are the one which
01:26 - basically communicate
01:27 - so basically controllers helps you to
01:30 - communicate
01:31 - between the above two so this is how mvc
01:33 - framework is completed
01:35 - so first thing we need to do is uh
01:39 - okay so first thing we need to do is we
01:42 - need to type
01:43 - rails server so basically i'll also give
01:47 - you a quick uh like overview what i like
01:49 - uh
01:50 - like important commands like initially
01:52 - you should know uh which will help you
01:54 - out
01:54 - so one command is rails server so
01:57 - this will start the server okay
02:01 - uh yeah another is rails console
02:05 - console so this will like
02:08 - uh this will like uh this will like this
02:11 - will
02:12 - start the console and you can like do
02:16 - interact with your database models
02:17 - inside this console so this has a short
02:19 - notations of rails s
02:22 - also known as rails s and this is also
02:24 - known as rail c
02:27 - uh another one is rails generate
02:31 - so basically generate is used to like
02:33 - generate
02:34 - like model views and controller so you
02:36 - can generate things with this
02:38 - so basically to generate and it has a
02:41 - short notation or rails
02:43 - g g so basically these are the commands
02:46 - you should know
02:47 - and preferably this should help you out
02:49 - like in this tutorial
02:51 - so first thing you need to remove inside
02:53 - your project directory i have already
02:54 - created a project
02:56 - and like you can and i've already
02:59 - created a project and
03:00 - then you i know i'll start the server
03:02 - inside my project i'll type rails server
03:05 - i've already created a project with the
03:06 - name my project so real servers is this
03:09 - so when i do this so the real server
03:11 - should start
03:12 - on my local machine so basically real
03:15 - server is start now started
03:17 - and when i like here you can see when i
03:20 - move to this port local host i see the
03:23 - server
03:24 - is running uh so here you can see the
03:26 - server is running on my machine
03:28 - so basically it starts on this board and
03:30 - i have a command line shell to like
03:32 - take care of the things now uh
03:35 - what you can do uh now i have terminated
03:38 - the
03:38 - like a server now i'll type rails
03:42 - generate controller
03:46 - and this should be my controller now
03:48 - after this i should have my controller
03:50 - name
03:50 - so basically i can type any controller
03:52 - so let me type root
03:54 - okay so just for your preference i'm
03:57 - typing root i'm highlighting this as
03:58 - well
03:59 - so like this is for my reference now
04:01 - when i
04:02 - run this command so now you will take it
04:05 - will take
04:05 - like a take a little bit of time
04:09 - not much but now here you can see that
04:11 - now it has created some files
04:13 - so the first thing is between like uh
04:16 - i taught you like these are like the
04:17 - commands you are going to like interact
04:19 - with rails most probably most of the
04:21 - time
04:22 - and these this is like it's like a
04:24 - definition however else is defined
04:26 - mvc model so now we are going to like uh
04:30 - have an overview of little bit of files
04:33 - because
04:33 - understanding the structure is very
04:35 - important so you need to understand
04:36 - where database is defined where views is
04:38 - defined where controllers are defined so
04:40 - this would help you out
04:41 - so most probably you can see here itself
04:46 - that inside my app folder uh there is a
04:49 - folder three folders like
04:51 - one is models okay one other is views
04:55 - and another is controllers okay so
04:59 - when i wrote this command rails generate
05:02 - controller root so it itself created
05:05 - a root controller inside here here you
05:08 - can see the rails convert
05:09 - rails had like generated this controller
05:11 - for me
05:12 - so so now you can see the class root
05:15 - controller like
05:16 - it has inherited the property from
05:18 - application controller
05:19 - so so here you can see so it has
05:23 - like uh so here you can see that that
05:25 - there is application controller here
05:27 - okay now uh my root controller inherits
05:30 - from application controller so like
05:32 - so uh like basically my root controller
05:34 - enables energy some properties from
05:36 - application controller so that is the
05:37 - part of inheritance
05:38 - but the main point is here is that it
05:40 - has already generated a root controller
05:42 - now i can now now when i have generated
05:45 - a controller so
05:46 - it has also generated the corresponding
05:48 - views for
05:49 - it also now inside my views folder here
05:51 - you can see
05:52 - uh there is a folder called root which
05:55 - rails generated
05:56 - right now it's empty but uh i'll show
05:59 - you how this works okay
06:01 - so now uh let's
06:04 - move to roush.rb now let's define
06:08 - a route get
06:12 - okay and
06:15 - we need to define get
06:20 - uh so first we will define few routes
06:22 - and then we will carry
06:24 - okay hey so hey hey
06:27 - everyone uh welcome back so first let's
06:30 - define a route
06:31 - so now i'll define like a route
06:34 - with get get request and it will say
06:38 - contact okay
06:41 - uh then i'll define a route with contact
06:43 - then slash
06:44 - about okay so
06:47 - they're like these are like few basic
06:49 - routes i've defined so
06:50 - now i'll define a two parameter which
06:52 - says where it should go
06:54 - when i hit this route okay where it
06:56 - should go
06:57 - so it should go to root
07:01 - okay okay now i'll show you first uh
07:04 - when i type slash contact
07:07 - uh slash contact and slash about so
07:12 - where should my function call
07:14 - exist okay so it should i will define a
07:17 - function in the root controller which
07:19 - says
07:20 - define about okay it says end
07:24 - and then another is defined
07:27 - contact okay and it says end
07:31 - so basically these two methods should be
07:34 - called inside the controller when i
07:35 - hit that route okay to clarify that we
07:38 - will say
07:38 - to root hash
07:42 - about okay and for this we will say
07:45 - root hash contact
07:49 - so when i hit these two routes you
07:51 - should call the
07:52 - about method inside the root controller
07:54 - and the contact method inside the root
07:56 - controller
07:57 - so when i reach here so it will hit this
08:01 - okay so let's first
08:05 - uh like uh now what you need to do
08:08 - and like now when you hit a route so
08:11 - basically you have two options either
08:12 - you create
08:13 - for particular request you have two
08:16 - options the first option is to
08:18 - uh for for for one request you have two
08:21 - option
08:22 - first is to return uh json response
08:27 - okay so basically that is your api
08:30 - or second is to render
08:33 - uh render html page
08:37 - so that is your second option okay so
08:41 - to make sure if you want to return like
08:42 - html page so you should have
08:44 - the inside your root folder basically
08:47 - inside views you have root so you should
08:49 - have
08:49 - a file with html name as
08:52 - about dot html
08:56 - dot erb and
08:59 - another should be contact
09:03 - dot html dot erv okay
09:06 - so like these are the two files and in
09:09 - this i will define an h1 tag of about
09:12 - okay okay and
09:17 - in this i will define a h1 tag of
09:20 - contact okay
09:23 - so here you can see like i have created
09:26 - this
09:27 - now when i hit these two routes uh like
09:30 - now i'll give a quick
09:31 - hit hit this hit these two routes when i
09:34 - hit them successfully
09:35 - you should call the like uh inside the
09:38 - root controller you should call this
09:40 - method
09:41 - about and contact and we will
09:44 - here by default say render about page
09:49 - okay and render
09:53 - contact okay and
09:57 - what we can also do we can say put s
10:00 - about page about in server
10:03 - okay put as about in server and in the
10:06 - same way we can say
10:08 - put as contact
10:11 - in server and like
10:14 - if we are able to like figure out like
10:17 - like this would really help us
10:18 - to see the console also okay
10:22 - so let's run this now
10:25 - let's run this we will type the command
10:27 - rail server
10:29 - so our server should start now
10:32 - okay so here you can see the server has
10:34 - started so
10:36 - now let's hit this page about so
10:39 - we have reached about and let's hit this
10:42 - one as well
10:43 - contact so here we have reached the
10:46 - contact page also
10:48 - and now you can see there is a specific
10:51 - line
10:52 - which says contact in server and it was
10:56 - also like then there is a line of
10:58 - about and server so here you can see
11:00 - whenever
11:01 - uh like i hit this route in the route
11:03 - short rb
11:05 - it calls the about method and the
11:06 - contact meter of my root controller
11:08 - make sure that it can have any name i i
11:10 - named it as root you can name it with
11:12 - any other name
11:14 - then when it it like when uh it had
11:17 - hated the like
11:18 - method so it had first run the put a
11:20 - statement then it called the render
11:22 - method to
11:22 - like render the html page so this is
11:25 - like the most basic tutorial
11:27 - to create a route and render an html
11:29 - page in place
11:30 - now in the next we will try to return a
11:32 - json response so i hope you
11:34 - you to catch up you all in the next
11:35 - tutorial so thank everyone for watching
11:37 - this
