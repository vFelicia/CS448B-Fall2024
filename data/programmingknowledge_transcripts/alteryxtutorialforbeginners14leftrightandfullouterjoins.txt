00:00 - hello everyone welcome to ultrex
00:02 - tutorials in this video we are going to
00:04 - take a look at the drawing tool in
00:06 - ultrix so the join tool is a part of the
00:09 - join tab group and it is a very useful
00:12 - tool in altrix we would be seeing all
00:14 - about this tool in this video
00:16 - so first of all let us understand that
00:18 - what is the basic functions of this tool
00:21 - a join tool is used to combine the two
00:23 - inputs based on some common fields
00:26 - between the two tables
00:28 - we can also join two data streams based
00:30 - upon the record position of those
00:32 - streams
00:33 - so for the join tool we have two inputs
00:35 - over here
00:36 - uh as you can see input data one
00:39 - we just click on it
00:41 - it would open the excel file
00:43 - so it has a few fields
00:47 - here and it is the segment field is the
00:50 - consumer segment as you can see all the
00:52 - segments are consumer over here in this
00:53 - field okay
00:55 - and the second we have is the same table
00:58 - but the number of records is different
01:00 - and the segment here is the corporate
01:03 - segment over here like this so here are
01:05 - the two sheets the consumer sheet and
01:06 - the corporate sheet which are actually a
01:08 - part
01:10 - and taken as two different inputs to be
01:12 - joined together right that means we have
01:14 - two inputs with common fields between
01:17 - them which we need to join
01:19 - now let us drag this join tool over here
01:22 - as you can see
01:24 - this is a join tool
01:26 - and um
01:28 - in order to perform the join
01:30 - we can
01:31 - uh
01:33 - actually use two options which are
01:35 - available in this configuration tab that
01:37 - is joined by record position or joined
01:39 - by specific fields
01:40 - now if we talk about join by record
01:42 - position this option is used when two
01:44 - tables have the same field structure
01:47 - and the data will be joined by its
01:49 - position within the two tables
01:51 - next we have is joined by specific
01:53 - fields
01:54 - it is used when the two tables have one
01:56 - or more fields in common and the data
01:59 - will be joined together on the basis of
02:01 - the common field only
02:03 - and we can choose to join based upon the
02:05 - multiple fields and each join should be
02:07 - a separate row in the grid like this is
02:09 - the grid so each join each criteria that
02:12 - you are giving for the join should be
02:13 - for a separate row in this table but i'm
02:15 - just going to go with the join with
02:17 - record position join by record position
02:19 - first of all let me just drag this one
02:22 - to l and the other two are so l means
02:25 - left and r means right these are the two
02:27 - anchors that we are getting
02:29 - now each input l and r or left and right
02:32 - has a drop down list
02:35 - from where we can just actually select
02:37 - the fields uh or the join field for each
02:40 - of the inputs
02:41 - altered
02:42 - designer will automatically select the
02:44 - field for us as in this case you can see
02:46 - it has selected the row id field for us
02:49 - to be taken as the drop down as the
02:51 - joining field okay
02:53 - now we can just use this table to modify
02:56 - the data that means it's type we can
02:58 - modify like right now it's double we can
03:00 - just select it to in 16 to reduce its
03:02 - size a little bit
03:05 - we can rename it so let's just rename it
03:07 - to a serial number just to show you that
03:10 - how the changes are going to work and
03:11 - like this we can just modify it like the
03:14 - data type the size we can rename it or
03:16 - add a description so let's just add a
03:18 - description that is serial
03:20 - number
03:23 - like this okay
03:25 - so these are the changes that i have
03:27 - done
03:29 - all right and then there is this unknown
03:31 - column which is basically used
03:33 - in case we want to add more columns
03:37 - now uh in case of the view output there
03:39 - are these three options that is the l
03:41 - anchor that contains the records from
03:43 - the l input that didn't join to the
03:45 - record from the r input the j anchor
03:47 - that contains the records that join from
03:50 - the l and the r input and then we have
03:52 - the r anchor
03:54 - uh that contains the records uh from the
03:56 - r input that didn't join into the
03:58 - records from the l input so this is the
04:00 - um
04:01 - order and these are the three anchors
04:03 - that have been shown over here if you
04:04 - just click on run
04:07 - so the joining would occur let's just
04:09 - click on the l anchor to get the uh
04:12 - records from the air input that didn't
04:13 - join to the records from the r input so
04:15 - a total of 2171 records are there
04:19 - we click on j so 3020 records are j uh
04:22 - in this j anchor that means the records
04:24 - that have been joined from the l input
04:27 - to the r input
04:29 - over here as you can see
04:32 - there are 3020 records and in this r
04:34 - anchor we have no records that means
04:36 - there are no records
04:38 - in the r input that didn't join to the
04:40 - records of the l input so this is how
04:42 - the join tool works
04:46 - and uh
04:47 - there are these different types of joins
04:49 - that can
04:51 - happen
04:52 - uh in this
04:54 - using the join tool first is the inner
04:56 - join that we have done right now
04:58 - specified by this j anchor this is the
05:00 - inner join that contains the records
05:03 - that join from the l input to the
05:04 - records in the r input
05:06 - uh this l anchor refers to the
05:09 - left unjoined that contains only of the
05:12 - records that didn't join to those of the
05:14 - r and this r contains of the are
05:17 - unjoined records
05:20 - uh next we have is a possibility of a
05:22 - left outer join that all the records
05:24 - from the l input including the records
05:26 - that join with the r input
05:28 - right
05:30 - now this can be achieved with the help
05:32 - of two tools the join tool and the union
05:33 - tool
05:37 - so what we can do is actually
05:40 - get a union tool
05:43 - here and if we just combine them
05:45 - together that means
05:47 - uh connect the j and l
05:50 - outputs are the join tool to the union
05:52 - tool so the l is connected let's just
05:54 - connect the j as well
05:55 - now if we just click on this output
05:58 - button
06:02 - and um
06:04 - just
06:05 - run it then what we would be getting is
06:07 - a total of 5191 records
06:10 - which is the result of the left outer
06:13 - join similarly if you want to get a
06:15 - result of the right outer join now what
06:16 - is right outer join uh that means all
06:19 - the records from the r input including
06:21 - the records that are joined
06:24 - with the l inputs again let's just get a
06:25 - union
06:26 - uh let's just drag the j
06:29 - and the r anchors over here
06:32 - and run the workflow
06:36 - so here it is let's just click on the
06:38 - output and this is around 3020 records
06:41 - that are a part of the right outer join
06:44 - last but not the least we have the full
06:46 - outer join so that means all the records
06:48 - that are
06:50 - a part of the l and the r inputs are
06:53 - the full outer join
06:56 - full outer join is actually similar to
07:00 - the append fields join which means it
07:03 - actually performs a cartesian join a
07:04 - combination of all the records of both
07:06 - the tables would be shown over here and
07:08 - the total number of rows would be the
07:10 - product of the
07:12 - individual rows in the
07:14 - tables so either we can directly use the
07:16 - pain fields or if you don't want to use
07:18 - the print fields then you can actually
07:20 - use a third option so what i'm gonna do
07:23 - is just copy these three tools
07:26 - right click copy and create a new
07:28 - workflow out of them so as to avoid the
07:30 - confusion
07:31 - and here i'm going to perform the
07:34 - full outer join so let's just get the
07:35 - union tool over here
07:38 - we need to connect all these three that
07:40 - is lj and r over here so first of all we
07:43 - need to connect the j
07:44 - output or the j anchor why we are doing
07:47 - it every time we are using the union
07:49 - tool after the join rule make sure you
07:51 - first connect the shape to establish the
07:54 - combined table schema that what is going
07:56 - to be the final table schema right
07:58 - then you can connect l
08:01 - and then you can connect r
08:04 - and then run this workflow
08:06 - so after a few seconds
08:09 - here is the output
08:10 - total of 5191 records would be displayed
08:13 - over here
08:16 - with all the values right and if you
08:18 - want to cross check your results what
08:20 - you can do is actually use the pen
08:21 - fields option
08:22 - so for this we are just going to copy
08:24 - these two tools
08:27 - you can select multiple by control
08:28 - clicking them right click copy
08:31 - go to the new workflow and paste them
08:33 - either using the shortcut ctrl v or
08:35 - simply just right click and paste right
08:38 - let me move it here get the append
08:40 - fields tool
08:42 - over here get it here
08:45 - and get it here
08:47 - run it
08:57 - allow all the pens and click on run
09:01 - it's going to take a few seconds of
09:03 - course apparent fields is a little bit
09:05 - slower option
09:07 - than
09:08 - the
09:09 - um
09:10 - union and the join tool combined so
09:13 - let's just wait for a few seconds
09:15 - and while you're waiting you can see
09:17 - actually the progress with which it is
09:19 - working on okay
09:22 - right so now if we just click on this
09:24 - output anchor
09:26 - then we would be seeing a total of all
09:28 - the records that are present over here
09:30 - so that is how the joints work uh the
09:33 - cartesian join or the
09:35 - full outer join the left outer join the
09:37 - right outer join and basically all the
09:39 - types of the joins with the help of the
09:41 - join tool union tool and the append
09:43 - files tool that is all that we would be
09:46 - looking at in this join tab and that's
09:48 - all for this video thanks for watching
