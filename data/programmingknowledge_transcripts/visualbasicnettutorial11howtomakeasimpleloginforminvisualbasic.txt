00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:03 - last video I have shown you how to link
00:05 - a second form with your first form so I
00:09 - have made uh a small little project in
00:13 - which when I click this button it opens
00:16 - the second form now in this video I will
00:19 - show you how to create a simple very
00:21 - simple
00:22 - login uh application with your Visual
00:26 - Basic Windows Form
00:28 - application so so let's get started it
00:31 - will be it will be a very basic login uh
00:35 - application and in the future I will
00:38 - also show you how to create a login page
00:41 - with the help of uh a database it may be
00:44 - myql database or SQL Server I will show
00:48 - you all but this is for very beginner
00:52 - level so let's get started I have this
00:57 - button which I uh take from the last
01:01 - video and one more thing I will take
01:05 - here
01:06 - is a text box so let me
01:11 - take uh text box from
01:14 - here and uh
01:17 - label okay so I have text box a label
01:23 - and a button I will change the label
01:27 - text as uh
01:31 - password and I will change the text of
01:37 - this text box as I will change the name
01:41 - of this text box as text
01:43 - box pass for textbox password and I will
01:48 - change the text of this button
01:52 - as login for example so when I click
01:56 - this button and when I enter some
01:58 - password it should would open a second
02:03 - form so just double click this button
02:06 - once again and in the last video I've
02:09 - have shown you how to
02:11 - simply just open the second form so I'm
02:13 - going to delete this and I will say
02:19 - if and make a bracket and uh I will say
02:23 - if text box password
02:30 - dot
02:37 - text is equal
02:40 - to double quotes and give any password
02:45 - which you want to match for example I
02:48 - give the password 1 2 3 4
02:51 - 5 and
02:53 - [Music]
02:54 - then I will
02:57 - say here I will write
03:02 - then and
03:07 - then and
03:13 - if and in here in between I will open
03:17 - the second form so I will write form
03:21 - 2
03:23 - dot
03:25 - show and bracket so it will validate
03:29 - this part password uh whatever you enter
03:32 - in the text box and if it's correct it
03:34 - will open the second form
03:40 - else what I will do is I will show a
03:46 - message that my password is not correct
03:51 - right so I will
03:56 - say
03:58 - password is
04:03 - not correct for
04:06 - example okay so now when I run the
04:11 - program and when I enter some random
04:14 - text and when I click login button it
04:18 - says me password is not
04:21 - correct and when I CL enter some real or
04:27 - valid password which is 1 2 3 4 5
04:31 - five and when I click this
04:33 - login button it
04:36 - opens this second form now for example
04:41 - you want to hide this form when second
04:45 - form opens so when this form opens you
04:48 - want to hide the first form how you can
04:52 - achieve that
04:53 - [Music]
04:56 - simply you need to add one more more
05:00 - line of code so go inside this if
05:03 - condition if password is true or
05:07 - whatever you enter in the text box is
05:09 - true then just below this form 2. show
05:13 - just write me
05:17 - dot hide so me refers to the form
05:23 - itself it's like saying this in C or
05:28 - it's like saying this
05:30 - in uh C++ also so when now I run the
05:35 - program and when I enter a valid
05:39 - password for example 1 2 3 4 5 and when
05:43 - I click this login button you will see
05:48 - the first form is disappeared
05:52 - right so in this way you can link the
05:56 - second form to first form and you you
05:59 - can make a login application a very
06:02 - simple and basic login application with
06:05 - the help of this Visual Basic Windows
06:08 - Form application in the future videos uh
06:13 - maybe after
06:14 - some some of the videos I will also show
06:18 - you how to connect a database and then
06:21 - also I will show you how to create a
06:23 - login page using whatever is saved in
06:28 - your database and how to validate the
06:31 - database password with the help of
06:33 - Visual Basic so stay tuned and please
06:36 - wait comment and subscribe and bye for
06:38 - now
