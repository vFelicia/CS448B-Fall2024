00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - mongod DB tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video I've shown you how you can
00:07 - download and install mongodb on your
00:09 - Windows operating system and I've also
00:12 - given you the brief introduction of
00:14 - mongod DB now in this video we will see
00:17 - how we can set up the environment
00:20 - variable for mongod DB so we don't need
00:23 - to you know open this mongod DB from
00:26 - this bin folder inside the mongod DB
00:28 - every time we open open the you know
00:30 - mongod DB from the shell and I'm also
00:33 - going to show you how you can download
00:36 - and install a graphical tool so that it
00:39 - will be easier to visualize you know
00:42 - data in the mongod DB so first of all we
00:46 - will set up the environment variable so
00:48 - what we need to do is just search for
00:52 - system in your uh Windows operating
00:56 - system and then in here go to Advanced
01:00 - system settings and in here go to
01:03 - environment variables and in here under
01:07 - system variables you just need to go to
01:09 - the path variable and you can either
01:13 - push this added button or double click
01:15 - on this path variable now be very
01:18 - careful you don't uh need to delete
01:21 - anything here and at the last at the
01:24 - very last you just need to give a
01:26 - semicolon here so just give a semicolon
01:30 - and then just copy the path of uh this
01:33 - mongod DB bin folder okay so in my case
01:37 - it's c/ program file SL mongodb SLS
01:41 - server SL 3.2 /bin but it can be
01:46 - different for you so just copy this path
01:48 - where your dotexe and mongod d.
01:52 - exe file is there right so copy this
01:55 - path and then after copying this path
01:57 - just paste it after this semicolon in
02:01 - the variable value okay so just paste
02:04 - this path and then click okay click okay
02:09 - and then once again click okay and now
02:12 - just open your terminal once again so
02:15 - right click on your uh start button and
02:19 - then open your command
02:21 - prompt and now from this place itself
02:26 - you can uh you know just give mongod d.
02:29 - EX C command so for example mongod d.
02:34 - EXC and then press
02:37 - enter and now you can see it's waiting
02:40 - for the connections so we are able to uh
02:43 - open this demon. exe file from
02:48 - somewhere else other than the bin folder
02:51 - right so this is uh happening due to the
02:55 - setup of the environment variable right
02:58 - now let's uh download and install a
03:01 - graphical tool which is called
03:04 - Chef to visualize uh the stuff so go to
03:08 - your favorite browser and search for
03:10 -  chef and search for it and in here
03:14 - you will be able to see this website
03:17 - which is
03:18 - 3.i
03:20 - slongo Chef so you just need to click
03:23 - this and this is a tool which you can
03:27 - download for free if you uh are not
03:30 - using this tool for the commercial
03:33 - purpose right so we uh just want to use
03:36 - this tool for visualization and it's not
03:41 - for commercial use we just want to learn
03:43 - from it right so I'm going to just click
03:46 - free download and then it will lead you
03:49 - to this page in here you just need to

05:24 - this Chef tool is installed on our
05:26 - Windows operating system we can just uh
05:29 - click this checkbox which will launch
05:32 - this uh tool and then we can click
05:34 - finish so it's going to launch
05:39 - chef and you can uh see uh it will give
05:42 - you this warning for what purpose we

05:47 - non-commercial use and we will uh
05:51 - confirm with the terms and conditions
05:53 - and click okay and then click
05:58 - okay
06:00 - and now this uh tool is open now for
06:03 - using this uh Chef make sure that
06:07 - your mongod d. exe is running in the
06:11 - background on your command prompt right
06:14 - so once again for example uh you just
06:17 - need to open your command prompt here
06:20 - and you just need to
06:22 - run mongod d. exe and press enter and
06:28 - once this is waiting for the connection
06:31 - we are ready to use this Chef okay
06:35 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
06:37 - go to this tool and I will go to the
06:40 - file and I will click connect or I will
06:43 - just click this
06:44 - button and then in here you can see this
06:48 - new connection tab so you just need to
06:50 - click new connection and then give the
06:53 - name to your connection for example you
06:56 - can give any name to your connection for
06:59 - example examp Le test or something
07:03 - else and then you can see uh the server
07:06 - name is Local Host in our case and this
07:09 - is the default port on which mongod DB
07:12 - will uh work which is
07:15 - 27017 okay so you can just click save
07:18 - here and then you can uh click connect
07:22 - and now it's going to show this local
07:25 - Here and Now what you need to do is you
07:28 - just need to click Intel I shell just
07:32 - click this button here and it's going to
07:35 - open this kind of shell and it's uh same
07:39 - as uh running your do exe shell
07:43 - right so whenever you give some command
07:46 - here for example DB and then we will run
07:50 - this command by clicking this uh button
07:53 - which says execute entire script or you
07:57 - can uh you know just just run this
08:00 - executed statement at cursor right so we
08:04 - are going to click this button and now
08:07 - you can see it says local okay so this
08:10 - is the uh test database which is already
08:14 - provided by uh the mongod DB to us okay
08:19 - and now you can open this command shell
08:22 - and I'm going to maximize it and you can
08:24 - see connection accepted from uh this uh
08:27 - Local Host and this port right so we
08:31 - know that our uh Chef tool is
08:35 - working and from the next video we will
08:38 - create some databases and we will learn
08:41 - more about uh the mongod DB Collections
08:45 - and documents okay so stay tuned and
08:47 - please wait comment subscribe and bye
