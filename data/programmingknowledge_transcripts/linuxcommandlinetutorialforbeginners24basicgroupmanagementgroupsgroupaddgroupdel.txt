00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will
00:06 - learn about the basics of group
00:09 - management using Linux terminal so I'm
00:14 - going to show you a bunch of commands
00:17 - and first come on I'm going to show you
00:19 - is a command called groups command and
00:24 - this command will allow you to see which
00:28 - are the groups your current user is
00:32 - connected to so my current user
00:34 - I'm login logged in with this
00:36 - programming knowledge and these are the
00:39 - groups my current user is you know
00:42 - connected to okay so these are the
00:46 - groups my current user is a member of
00:48 - right now the next command I'm going to
00:52 - show you is to list all the groups which
00:56 - are available on your operating system
00:59 - so this command is cat so this is a
01:05 - directory called etc' and in this etc'
01:09 - directory there is a file called groups
01:12 - and all the groups are listed there so
01:16 - we are going to just write etc' and then
01:19 - just write group here and then press
01:23 - ENTER and it's going to show you all the
01:26 - groups which are there on your systems
01:29 - right and you can see there is a group
01:34 - called jenkins and the last you can see
01:39 - the user which is connected to the group
01:42 - so for example my user is connected to
01:45 - this group for example or the user from
01:50 - which i'm logged in is connected to LP
01:53 - admin also right so this is the command
01:57 - for listing all the groups available in
02:00 - your Linux operating system right now
02:04 - the next command is to add the new group
02:08 - to this list of groups so these groups
02:11 - are added to this file
02:13 - in you know date wise order so whatever
02:19 - groups you will add now it will be added
02:21 - to the bottom of this file okay
02:24 - so let's add a group so I'm going to
02:26 - write sudo and then write a command
02:29 - called a group ad so just write group ad
02:34 - and then the name of the group so for
02:38 - example I want to add a group called
02:40 - Java here I am going to press ENTER and
02:43 - I am going to give my password so this
02:46 - Java group will be added to the file in
02:50 - the et Cie group
02:53 - okay so just cat this once again and you
02:57 - can see this group is added to your you
03:02 - know group list right in the same way I
03:05 - can add multiple groups for example this
03:09 - time I want to add CPP group and then I
03:11 - want to add Python group and for example
03:17 - I want to add database group right and
03:23 - once again I will see all these groups
03:25 - using this cat ETCs forward slash group
03:29 - command and you can see all these groups
03:32 - are added to your group list right now
03:35 - the next command is to delete these
03:39 - groups how we can delete these groups
03:42 - okay so for example I want to delete the
03:45 - group called a CPP then I can just write
03:49 - sudo for giving the root access and then
03:52 - we are just going to write rope del for
03:56 - deleting the group and the name of the
03:58 - growth for example CPP okay so press
04:01 - ENTER and then list the groups again and
04:05 - now you can see this group called CPP is
04:07 - deleted now the next command I am going
04:10 - to show you here is how you can assign a
04:13 - user to a particular group so for
04:17 - example I want to assign the user for
04:21 - example this user program
04:23 - knowledge to the database group how can
04:26 - I add this user to this database group
04:29 - so for this also we will write sudo
04:34 - first of all and then just write G PA SS
04:39 - WD right and then right - a flag for
04:46 - adding the group and - D flag for
04:49 - removing from the group removing user
04:52 - from the group right first of all we
04:55 - will add the user to the group so - a
04:58 - flag for adding the user and then the
05:01 - username which you want to add to the
05:03 - group so programming knowledge and then
05:06 - the next a is the name of the group you
05:10 - want to add it to so this is the name of
05:13 - the group you want to add and this is
05:16 - the command
05:16 - okay so sudo G passwd - a for adding the
05:21 - group then the username and then the
05:24 - group name and press enter and then you
05:27 - can see we can see the message adding
05:30 - user this to the group this right and
05:33 - then we can list the group once again
05:36 - and you can see this user is now the
05:39 - member of the database group right now
05:43 - if you want to remove this user you can
05:46 - just write instead of for a flag you can
05:50 - use the flag for removing the user from
05:53 - the group and press enter and you can
05:56 - see this message removing user program
05:59 - programming knowledge from group
06:01 - database and we can verify it by just
06:04 - you know printing the content of this
06:07 - file again and you can see the user
06:10 - programming knowledge is no longer the
06:13 - member of database group right so in
06:16 - this way you can use group management
06:20 - and these are some of the command which
06:23 - you can use for group management in your
06:26 - Linux operating system using terminal I
