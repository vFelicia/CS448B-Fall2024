00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - laravel tutorial series and this is the
00:07 - sixth part or part six of our tutorial
00:10 - series and in the previous video we
00:12 - talked about blade templates and for
00:15 - today's video we're going to discuss
00:17 - about how to compile assets in our
00:19 - laravel project but first let us try to
00:22 - pass data as an array of values so last
00:25 - time we passed parameter as array but
00:30 - what if try to pass data or an array of
00:34 - data inside an array so we'll try to do
00:37 - that here in this video and let's go
00:40 - ahead and instead of passing only the
00:43 - title we'll just pass another array of
00:46 - data here
00:47 - so services and then we're going to add
00:51 - we're going to add regular array here
00:54 - for our services so number one will be
00:58 - web design second one is programming
01:05 - third will be SEO all right so since
01:12 - we're passing this services inside the
01:15 - data array so we should be able to
01:18 - access that in our services that laid
01:20 - that PHP file and in order for us to do
01:23 - that we need to check if there is if the
01:27 - services array contains something so we
01:32 - could add a logic here so if count and
01:35 - then the services is greater than zero
01:46 - and below here let's try to add the and
01:52 - if there you go
01:54 - and of course we need to iterate our
01:57 - services array if it is not empty so add
02:00 - for each for each and then the services
02:05 - as service and we need to add also the N
02:12 - of our 4-h and of course inside inside
02:18 - this for each we need to like if we need
02:21 - to add the LI for our service something
02:25 - like that and then we need to get the
02:28 - server's itself and we need to add the
02:33 - UL for our or inside this if statement
02:38 - so you well here save and let's try to
02:49 - preview our page this is the home page
02:53 - of our application and if you try to go
02:56 - to services we can see here we have the
03:01 - data coming from our pages controller
03:04 - and we're passing the data including the
03:08 - web design programming and SEO now let's
03:11 - talk about compiling or how to compile
03:13 - assets in our laravel project so before
03:16 - we proceed let's download first the no
03:18 - genius so if you're Windows user or Mac
03:23 - OS X user so there is available and
03:27 - solar for you and you can have the
03:31 - 32-bit 64-bit options but we'll just try
03:37 - to install it by using this means
03:39 - windows installer and install it in our
03:44 - local machine so after downloading we
03:48 - can just install it right away open up
03:50 - the installation package and then try to
03:56 - click on next and then accept the terms
03:58 - and
03:59 - the license agreement so next and then
04:03 - the installation path and then next and
04:06 - then make sure to enable all this
04:08 - options here the node.js runtime the NPM
04:12 - package manager online the commendation
04:16 - shortcuts and then add to our
04:19 - environment path in the next and there's
04:23 - an option here the to automatically
04:25 - install the necessary tools and there's
04:30 - a note that this will also install the
04:32 - chocolaty and the script will pop up in
04:35 - a new window after installation process
04:37 - so to save us from trouble so let's just
04:40 - enable this and then next and install
04:44 - and then we'll just wait for a few
04:47 - seconds to enable the node G as
04:51 - installation to complete and then after
04:54 - installation we should be able to like
04:58 - for example include bootstrap in our
05:00 - project to include other dependencies
05:04 - for our project and so on and now that
05:07 - the installation is complete so let's go
05:12 - back to our project here we are we can
05:15 - try to open up our PowerShell window and
05:19 - then let's try to see the version of our
05:25 - nodejs so we have the V version 12.13.12
05:32 - also we can see the version for our NPM
05:36 - which is also 6.12 point one so by this
05:42 - time we can already include our
05:44 - bootstrap insulation for our project now
05:48 - we just want to run the command composer
05:51 - require laravel and then /uy and then
05:56 - we're just going to wait for a few
05:57 - seconds to allow the installation to
06:00 - complete and we should be able to
06:02 - incorporate the necessary libraries for
06:06 - our laravel UI so as you can see this
06:10 - will also install the bootstrap
06:12 - in our normal project so we can already
06:16 - use that if we have a successful
06:20 - installation for our laravel UI and now
06:26 - that the insulation for our laravel UI
06:28 - has been completed so we need to run
06:31 - also or to include also the dependencies
06:34 - for our oath so this will include the
06:37 - login and register view so PHP artisan
06:40 - and then UI views - - oath and this will
06:47 - install the log in register and after
06:50 - that we need to run the command npm
06:52 - install to compile the CSS and other
06:56 - dependences of our project so we should
06:58 - be able to see the login the register
07:00 - and other views included for our UI and
07:06 - view oath or oath dependencies so i'll
07:11 - try to show you that after this
07:15 - installation so we're just going to wait
07:18 - for a few seconds for it to complete and
07:21 - then we should be able to see the
07:23 - changes in our browser by the way if you
07:26 - can see here at the top there's a prompt
07:29 - here that the layout app blade that PHP
07:33 - view already exists so do you want to
07:35 - replace it so in my case I have said or
07:38 - I have set it to N or no but you can try
07:44 - to accept it or to replace the existing
07:48 - layout of our app that late at page
07:51 - please so you can try to answer yes for
07:53 - that and then the layout of our project
07:56 - will be changed according to this update
07:59 - and this layout balloon will also
08:03 - include the old the login and then
08:05 - register as I've mentioned before and as
08:10 - you can see here I have here the layout
08:13 - view already exist and do you want to
08:15 - replace it and I just answered why or
08:18 - yes for that so I just want to replace
08:22 - the existing app that made that page way
08:24 - that we have been working on
08:26 - in the previous tutorial and after that
08:29 - you need to run also the command npm run
08:31 - dev to compile all the necessary assets
08:35 - that we have so here we have the app
08:37 - that CSS and app dot j s and after
08:43 - running this command we should be able
08:45 - to see the changes of our project so i'm
08:48 - going to show you the project now and
08:51 - what it looks like so this is our
08:55 - project should look right now and as you
08:57 - can see we have here the CSS folder that
09:00 - contains the app that CSS or generated
09:03 - app that CSS that contains all twitter
09:07 - bootstrap styles necessary to apply to
09:10 - our project and we also have the J's
09:13 - file or GS directory with the app that J
09:16 - s file as you can see with all the
09:21 - scripts needed for our project so this
09:24 - is the compiled versions of all the Java
09:26 - scripts or scripts for our project and
09:29 - as you can see here the resources we
09:31 - have here the app GS and the bootstrap
09:35 - Jas and as I've mentioned before we also
09:39 - include the oath files so it should be
09:44 - the log in that Lagoon blade that PHP
09:48 - registered blade that PHP and verify
09:51 - that they are verified that blade that
09:53 - PHP and of course we also have this
09:56 - files for our passwords so confirm email
10:00 - and reset and now let's try to preview
10:03 - our code in our browser so this is the
10:05 - home page of our project right now and
10:07 - if we try to go to about section so we
10:12 - can still see the about us and then this
10:14 - is the about page tax and of course we
10:18 - can also see the services with all the
10:20 - services included the web design
10:22 - programming and SEO so this are the
10:27 - pages that we have added the login and
10:29 - then register if you try to click on
10:31 - that so as you can see we have here the
10:33 - ready-made login form and the same thing
10:37 - with our register so I think that's it
10:40 - for this tutorial and in the next video
10:42 - we're going to talk about models and
10:44 - database migrations so see you in the
10:47 - next video thanks
