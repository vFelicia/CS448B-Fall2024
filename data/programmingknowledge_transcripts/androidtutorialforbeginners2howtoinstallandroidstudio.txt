00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:05 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:07 - how to configure and install Java jdk
00:11 - which was a prerequisite to install
00:13 - Android studio now in this video we will
00:17 - see how we can download and install
00:19 - Android Studio itself and we will also
00:23 - see how we can configure our first
00:26 - application using Android studio so so
00:30 - first of all open your favorite browser
00:31 - and search for Android studio and uh
00:34 - most probably the first link you will
00:36 - see here is from
00:39 - developer.android.com Tool
00:42 - studio and click this link and in here
00:46 - you will be able to see
00:48 - somewhere the download link so this is
00:51 - the download link down download Android

00:57 - and in here uh there there will be a
01:00 - download button download Android Studio
01:02 - for Windows just click this link and
01:06 - here you will be able to see some
01:09 - license terms and condition you need to
01:12 - agree to download Android Studio so just
01:15 - click this link and click
01:17 - download and save the file now this is a
01:22 - relatively uh Big File I think it's
01:26 - about uh 828 MB so it will take some
01:31 - time to download so just sit back relax
01:35 - and you know grab a cup of tea while
01:38 - downloading this and once this is uh
01:41 - downloaded I will show you how you can
01:43 - install and configure Android
01:48 - Studio so download is complete now so we
01:52 - are going to run this executable file
01:54 - for Android
01:56 - studio and I'm going to minimize
01:58 - everything so we can see See
02:01 - Clearly so now Android Studio executable
02:05 - file is running I will ask for the
02:11 - authentication click
02:14 - yes and now the setup will start just
02:17 - click next click next agree with the
02:22 - license and condition in order to
02:24 - install and this is the location which
02:27 - is default location where Android studio
02:30 - will be installed and this will be the
02:34 - location for the Android SDK folder so
02:39 - just uh make a note of this this we are
02:43 - going to need if some problem occurs
02:47 - related to
02:49 - SDK so click next and click
02:53 - install and the installation will
02:57 - start and it will finish in few
03:14 - seconds so it's not uh very lengthy
03:19 - process it will complete in few seconds
03:23 - you can see here as it's complete we are
03:27 - going to configure the
03:34 - SDK so now our Android Studio setup has
03:37 - been successfully completed you just
03:40 - need to click the next button and then
03:43 - it will uh prompt you to start Android
03:46 - Studio so just uncheck this button or

03:53 - so now our Android Studio setup has been
03:56 - completed now what we need to do is if
03:59 - you are and on Windows 8 you just need
04:03 - to search for Android
04:07 - Studio or if you are on Windows 7 you
04:11 - just need to click the start button and

04:45 - time it will ask for the import if you
04:50 - have a previous version of Android
04:52 - Studio it will ask if you want to import
04:56 - your previous uh Android Studio settings
04:59 - or otherwise if you don't have you just
05:02 - need to go with the default value and
05:04 - click
05:09 - okay and Android studio now is going to
05:16 - start Android Studio is uh intellig
05:21 - based IDE intellig is a very famous uh
05:25 - you know company or you can say for for
05:29 - developing uh idees so they have uh very
05:34 - good idees for developing Java python
05:38 - C++ and many other applications so
05:42 - Android Studio is uh developed by
05:45 - developed by
05:47 - intellig and right
05:50 - now our Android Studio setup is
05:54 - downloading the Android SDK tools this
05:58 - is a one time
06:00 - process so don't worry every time you
06:02 - run Android Studio it it is not going to
06:05 - do this this is just for the first time
06:08 - Android Studio is going to uh download
06:11 - these SDK tools so I will wait for uh
06:16 - these tools to
06:18 - download so everything is successfully
06:21 - done now now we just need to click
06:25 - finish and this is for the first time
06:28 - whenever you uh start Android Studio for
06:32 - the first time you will see the
06:34 - interface like this now before creating
06:38 - the first application we need to
06:41 - configure SDK or some packages so you
06:46 - just need to go to this option called
06:49 - configure and then you just need to
06:52 - click SDK
06:55 - manager it will open SDK manager and in
07:01 - here some of the packages uh you will

07:43 - will be this Intel x86 emulator
07:49 - accelerator and in short it's called hxm
07:54 - installer this is the emulator we are
07:57 - going to use to uh run our Android app

08:06 - checkbox and we are we will be done
08:10 - right so you just need to click one
08:13 - option here which is Intel x86 emulator
08:19 - accelerator now in my case it's already
08:23 - installed if it's not installed then you
08:26 - need to install it okay so so just uh
08:31 - check this checkbox if uh this is not
08:34 - installed right and now just click
