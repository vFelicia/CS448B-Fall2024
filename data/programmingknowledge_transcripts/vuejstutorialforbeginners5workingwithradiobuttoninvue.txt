00:35 - you can create click on the button new
00:37 - file in your
00:38 - directory and you can name this as index
00:42 - 5 dot html so

00:51 - tutorial so we have
00:52 - we have worked on this so yeah
00:56 - so sorry for the interruption yeah so
00:58 - let's
00:59 - carry on with the tutorial so what we
01:02 - can do
01:03 - we can uh from the previous template we
01:05 - can
01:06 - control copy this select all using ctrl
01:10 - a and we can paste it here
01:12 - and what we'll do we'll do to change
01:14 - this to learn view tutorial number
01:16 - five and when we
01:20 - and we will remove all this script tag
01:24 - okay so we remove this script tag and we
01:27 - also remove the
01:28 - this body tag so yeah so let me
01:32 - close this uh file explorer yeah
01:35 - so we have a like a simple rock and
01:38 - raw html page with this view script
01:41 - added
01:42 - so what we can do so we can click on
01:45 - this
01:45 - open and reveal in file explorer
01:49 - and you can double click on this and
01:51 - close this
01:53 - so this would open the page in your yeah
01:56 - browser so like perfectly fine so what
01:59 - you can do you can
02:00 - click on right click and inspect to
02:02 - check whether view js is running or not
02:05 - on the console yeah it's perfectly
02:06 - running so what we need to do
02:08 - today we will learn about the radio
02:10 - buttons
02:12 - so what you can do
02:15 - yeah so you can add a radio button
02:19 - so let's create a div
02:23 - we'll create a form so form
02:26 - id is equal to
02:30 - so let this be my form
02:34 - and you can also do this without a form
02:36 - just for
02:37 - it will also work div id is equal to my
02:40 - form
02:41 - we can close this div
02:44 - yeah so what you can do
02:48 - what you can do uh you can create
02:51 - a uh like what you can do you can do
02:54 - input type
02:58 - is equal to radio and
03:02 - id
03:04 - is equal to uh you can give it any id
03:08 - depending on your value so
03:11 - let's took this as male
03:15 - and because we are corresponding to the
03:17 - gender
03:18 - and the value is equal to male
03:22 - okay now what you can do
03:25 - we can create
03:29 - label for mail
03:34 - and you can
03:37 - perfectly fine so this is mail
03:41 - and you in the same way you can do
03:44 - input type
03:48 - is equal to female oh sorry input type
03:51 - is go to radio
03:54 - and id would be female
04:01 - and what you can do id is about female
04:04 - and value
04:08 - is equal to female
04:12 - and you can do label
04:16 - for and this label could
04:19 - depends on the id so female would be the
04:22 - id
04:23 - and you can give the value email
04:31 - so this looks perfectly fine so when i
04:34 - moved to the page
04:36 - i would refresh this
04:39 - and here you can see i have two options
04:42 - but
04:42 - you can right now you have you can see
04:46 - the this option isn't
04:49 - working with like the radio button out
04:51 - of the radio button it is like a
04:52 - multiple choice question
04:54 - so you can select only one out of the
04:57 - choices
04:57 - now the choices could be any number of
05:00 - choices
05:00 - but you can choose only one so this
05:04 - isn't working right now
05:05 - the reason being that we have not
05:09 - used like what you can do one thing i'll
05:12 - tell you
05:13 - uh one thing you can do you can put a
05:17 - name tag
05:18 - and name is go to gender and you can put
05:21 - this name is equal to gender here also
05:26 - so okay just a minute
05:30 - i'll show you one thing okay let it just
05:33 - be this form
05:35 - so i'll close editor yeah so right now
05:38 - i'll refresh this page so i can click
05:42 - uh all the choices that's and that isn't
05:45 - that is not
05:45 - that is not the use case of a radio
05:47 - button in the radio button you can
05:48 - choose select
05:49 - only one choice of the multiple only you
05:52 - can select only one choice
05:54 - of the multiple choices given to you so
05:56 - it is like a mcq multiple if you have an
05:58 - mcq question that is multiple choices
06:00 - you can choose and only a one option so
06:03 - but this time we are you you're choosing
06:04 - two so this is invalid to remove that
06:06 - what you can do you can add a name let's
06:08 - enter
06:09 - and name is equal to gender and you can
06:11 - refresh this page
06:12 - and now you can select only one
06:15 - out of the two but we are going to
06:18 - implement the same functionality
06:20 - using vue.js what we can do first we
06:23 - will
06:23 - create a view component constant view
06:26 - okay but before that we are going to
06:28 - create a script tag
06:30 - okay yeah perfectly fine so we'll look
06:34 - at the script tag
06:36 - yes so here is our script type and we'll
06:40 - do constant
06:43 - view component
06:47 - is equal to new so
06:51 - like spelling is wrong component
06:57 - so constant view component is go to new
07:00 - view
07:02 - and it will have a json object we all
07:05 - know it will have an element
07:07 - e02 and we will give the id as
07:11 - my form and the data
07:16 - is going to be there and in the same way
07:20 - the method it's going to be there
07:25 - so let's refresh this page so the page
07:29 - works perfectly fine and we can do
07:31 - console
07:34 - block also console.log
07:38 - new component so dash refresh space so
07:42 - perfectly fine
07:43 - now what i'm going to do we i'll make a
07:46 - data
07:49 - uh my choice
07:53 - okay so what you can do we can pick a
07:56 - data
07:57 - my choice
08:00 - and you can create this
08:03 - my choice uh okay
08:06 - you can choose this to be null
08:10 - okay so my choice in the beginning is
08:13 - null
08:14 - and what you can do instead of this
08:17 - gender
08:19 - or you can choose this to be gender
08:23 - let this be gender and
08:27 - we can we model this the
08:30 - model is equal to gender so
08:33 - this is perfectly fine and now we can
08:37 - refresh this page
08:41 - and what you can do you can
08:47 - print this value or render this value on
08:51 - the component
08:52 - so let's refresh this when i click on
08:55 - female it's female when i click on mail
08:57 - it is made
08:58 - female or male and female male okay so
09:01 - first we
09:02 - did that did using the name but now we
09:04 - did using the v
09:05 - model so that's perfectly fine so
09:08 - we'll continue with the uh another uh
09:11 - another learning on the next tutorial so
09:13 - this is
09:14 - uh for this tutorial only okay so thank
