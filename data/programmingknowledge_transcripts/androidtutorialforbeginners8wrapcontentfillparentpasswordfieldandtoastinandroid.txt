00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:03 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:05 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:08 - to use WAP content and fill parent
00:12 - properties with your uh layout uh withth
00:17 - of your widgets and we will also see if
00:20 - time permits how to use a password field
00:24 - in uh Android activity so for example I
00:28 - will take a button
00:30 - here and for the first time when you
00:33 - drag and drop a button it's uh property
00:37 - layout property uh when I say property
00:42 - in here when you go to the property
00:44 - called layout colon width its property
00:48 - is set to wrap content and wrap content
00:53 - uh just mean that the component just
00:57 - want to display uh big enough to enclose
01:01 - its content only okay so it's button
01:06 - content is only button and the button
01:09 - size or width is enough to uh show the
01:13 - button text on this um button right in
01:17 - the same way the layout height is also
01:21 - WAP content here okay so the height is
01:24 - also enough to show the button content
01:28 - okay but uh whenever you uh change this
01:33 - uh layout width for example I'm going to
01:35 - change it to fill
01:39 - parent see what happens it fills all the
01:43 - uh width of your activity here right so
01:50 - the fill parent me method the component
01:54 - or in the fill parent method the
01:56 - component want to display as big as it
01:59 - its parent and the parent is activity
02:02 - here right and fills the
02:06 - remaining uh space right so whenever you
02:11 - change the layout with to fill parent it
02:15 - fills all the all the space in the
02:19 - parent okay and parent is is the
02:23 - activity now I will change it to rap
02:26 - content itself and now I'm going to
02:29 - change CH the layout height of uh this
02:32 - button to fill parent and now whenever
02:37 - you do this for layout height it fills
02:42 - all the height right all the space which
02:45 - is available in the height uh of the
02:48 - parent right and when you do fill parent
02:52 - for both it will fill all the space of
02:56 - your uh parent okay so these are some of
03:01 - the properties related to the uh layout
03:06 - height and layout
03:08 - width and
03:10 - whenever uh
03:12 - you for example I will just change it
03:18 - to wrap content both of the width and
03:23 - height and then I will just change uh to
03:27 - match parent and then also it will match
03:30 - the parent space Also okay and I can do
03:35 - match parent in layout height and it
03:39 - will cover the whole uh height or space
03:43 - in the parent okay so this is how you
03:47 - can
03:47 - resize your or you can adjust the layout
03:51 - width and layout height of your widget
03:55 - okay now let's see uh how to use
04:00 - how to use a password field in Android
04:05 - activity so what we are going to do is
04:08 - we are going to drag and drop this
04:10 - password in text field widgets so go to
04:14 - the text field category here and drag
04:17 - and drop this uh password category okay
04:21 - password text field from here and I'm
04:24 - going to drag and drop this and this
04:28 - here I'm going to give the width as fill
04:32 - parent okay so it fills the parent okay
04:37 - and now this password whenever I run the
04:43 - activity here always comes the you know
04:47 - uh it Heights the characters and it only
04:51 - shows the specific character which you
04:54 - want to display
04:58 - okay
05:00 - so when I run this app on emulator you
05:03 - can see whenever I want to enter some
05:06 - text in this um password text field you
05:11 - see it's every character is replaced by
05:14 - this dot okay now we will use this
05:19 - button to show whatever we have entered
05:23 - in the password field so what we are
05:27 - going to do is uh we are going to go to
05:31 - uh our main activity here so in the
05:35 - project I'm going to go to main
05:37 - activity. Java file and in
05:41 - here in the main activity itself I'm
05:46 - going to declare two variables one
05:51 - is
05:54 - private added
05:57 - text added text
06:00 - and I will name it as for example pass
06:04 - for password or pass underscore word
06:08 - okay and in the same way I will declare
06:13 - a private
06:20 - button now what I'm going to do is I'm
06:23 - going to create a method so that on
06:27 - button click event this method is called
06:31 - and then we are going to display this
06:34 - text so what we are going to do is we
06:37 - are going to declare a public
06:40 - void and we name it this method as ADD
06:46 - listener on
06:54 - button button okay and we are not going
07:00 - to pass any argument to this and then
07:04 - inside this method what uh we are going
07:07 - to do is we are going to cast these
07:10 - password and button
07:28 - fields
07:31 - so because the name of our button or ID
07:34 - of our button is button itself and uh
07:37 - added text is added text itself button
07:39 - and added text that's why I have uh used
07:43 - added text and buttons here okay now
07:47 - what we are going to do
07:50 - is we are going to take this
07:53 - button
07:55 - and in here this
07:58 - button and then we are going
08:03 - to add a listener to this button so
08:07 - button and then dot
08:11 - set on click
08:15 - listener on click listener and then
08:20 - inside this listener we are going to
08:22 - create onclick listener okay so we will
08:27 - create a new instance of on click
08:30 - listener
08:35 - new on click
08:39 - listener and then in here when you click
08:43 - click enter it's going to create a
08:46 - method so let's let me readjust the code
08:50 - a little bit now inside your
08:54 - onclick method here you can display a
08:59 - message now to display a message in
09:03 - Android you need to import a library
09:06 - called
09:07 - toast and toast is a library which uh we
09:13 - can use to show
09:16 - messages so an Android messages are
09:20 - called toasts okay so we will
09:28 - import
09:31 - now once you imported this Library we
09:33 - can uh display the message using toast
09:38 - inside this onclick event so to display
09:42 - a message you just need to write
09:46 - toast dot make
09:50 - text and inside this make test text you
09:55 - can display a message okay okay so what
10:00 - you can do here is you just need to uh
10:04 - give the name of your activity which is
10:08 - in our case it's main activity so we
10:12 - will pass this as a first argument
10:15 - dot this and the second argument we are
10:19 - going to pass is the password field
10:22 - which we are going to take so this is
10:25 - our password
10:28 - variable
10:36 - in this uh we are going to
10:40 - uh give the show
10:43 - method so just go outside the make text
10:48 - method and just write dot
10:51 - show okay and this will show this uh
10:55 - text message whatever we have entered in
10:59 - the password field okay so this is also
11:03 - one kind of a button listener we have
11:05 - made
11:06 - indirectly and this button listener we
11:10 - can add this method to our on
11:14 - create method here like this and
11:19 - then your activity will listen for this
11:23 - button click event right so now we are
11:27 - going to run this
11:29 - and once this runs we are going to see
11:33 - how we can display a message using this
11:37 - text
11:39 - field so our app is running now and we
11:43 - are going to enter some text here as a
11:46 - password for
11:47 - [Music]
11:51 - example
11:54 - YouTube okay and I will click okay and
11:58 - when I press the button it shows the
12:01 - message YouTube and it disappears after
12:03 - some time okay for example I can enter
12:09 - some other
12:14 - text programming knowledge and I will
12:18 - click the button and it shows this
12:20 - message programming knowledge okay so in
12:24 - this way you can use password field and
12:26 - uh toast which uh we which is a short
12:30 - form of messages in
12:33 - Android uh using this Java code so I
12:37 - hope you have enjoyed this video please

12:40 - now
