00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will say
00:04 - there how to combine the results of two
00:08 - selects that man from two one other
00:10 - tables to different tables basically so
00:13 - for that we use Union operator the Union
00:17 - operator is used to combine the result
00:19 - set of two or more select statements
00:22 - coming from multiple tables so there are
00:25 - some condition to use Union operator the
00:29 - first one is each select statement with
00:32 - engineer must have the same number of
00:35 - columns so if you have two columns in
00:39 - one table let's say and three columns in
00:41 - another double then you want perform
00:43 - Union operation the second one is the
00:47 - column must also have this similar data
00:49 - type so the SQL combined the result set
00:55 - of the entire query so the individual
00:59 - select statement must have this similar
01:01 - data type and the columns in each select
01:05 - statement must also be the same order
01:08 - okay so let me just open terminal is
01:17 - given
01:28 - let me see which are the database that
01:31 - we have I have no data test database
01:39 - here just use that
01:48 - so what it has is changed let me show
01:52 - you the tables so yeah we are going to
01:59 - use prudent angst on two tables
02:02 - let me show you the content of student
02:05 - table total basically they both are same
02:19 - except just want to doesn't contain any
02:24 - records for certain fields so let me is
02:30 - Union select I want to select ID it's a
02:37 - roll number okay from the student one
02:42 - student I want to Union this with
02:48 - another select let's say ID
03:00 - as you can see we have this and this
03:08 - data here and union only shows the
03:13 - distinct values if your data appears in
03:20 - both tables then it won't show two times
03:23 - it only shows one times so let me show
03:29 - you another example select roll number
03:31 - from strong union let's say select name
03:35 - here as you can see first appear roll
03:47 - number from this table another name from
03:57 - this table and one thing that you
04:01 - observe that insulin - double we have
04:04 - one two three four five six rows while
04:08 - here we have one two three four five
04:11 - only five words now why is that let me
04:15 - just show you in MySQL workbench just
04:19 - terminate this mask you'll backbench let
04:28 - me write the same query select row
04:34 - number from student
04:42 - Union singing man wrong here
04:56 - as you can see we have one two three
04:58 - four five this is because if you see the
05:04 - records which are present means double
05:10 - strand to double sorry the LX appears
05:16 - two times so as I said earlier it won't
05:20 - so the results multiple times is only so
05:22 - one time but if you want to force it if
05:27 - you want to force the SQL query - so the
05:32 - duplicate record salsa then you can use
05:35 - Union odd again I will fire this query
05:41 - as you can see we are getting LX
05:44 - multiple times twice
05:46 - okay so this is how you can combine the
05:50 - result of selector and which are coming
05:52 - from multiple tables you can use as many
05:55 - years of tables but there are three
06:01 - conditions that I mentioned in starting
06:04 - of the video is select segment within
06:06 - Union must have the same number of
06:08 - columns and there yet I must be same
06:10 - okay thanks for watching
