01:21 - like this here we just need to click on
01:25 - continue here on the next window you can
01:28 - read about our programming language like
01:32 - what comes with this package or what are
01:34 - the requirements so you can read about
01:36 - that and then click on

01:41 - and conditions page so read these
01:42 - license terms and conditions carefully
01:44 - and then click on continue and here if

01:49 - conditions click on agree which is going
01:52 - to redirect us to the next window this
01:55 - is the actual installation window and
01:58 - it's going to give you the information
02:00 - about the installation how much space
02:01 - it's going to take if you're okay with

02:26 - successful that means R is installed on
02:29 - our Mac operating system we can close
02:32 - this window and then click on move to
02:35 - bin because we no longer need this
02:38 - package file once R is installed we can
02:42 - go to the Launchpad and here you will be
02:45 - able to find the our programming
02:48 - language icon so just click on this R
02:51 - programming language icon which is going

03:00 - command plus to make this text bigger
03:04 - and I can press command minus to make
03:07 - this uh text smaller here so here using

03:36 - is really simple just type Q and then
03:39 - these parentheses and then press enter
03:42 - and then it's going to ask you if you
