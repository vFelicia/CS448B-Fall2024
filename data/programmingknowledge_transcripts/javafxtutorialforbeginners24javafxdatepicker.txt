00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java effects tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - this video we will see how to use date
00:07 - picker in Java effects so let's get
00:10 - started I have created this sample
00:12 - project which is called date picker and
00:16 - in the application package I have this
00:18 - main dot Java in which I have added this
00:21 - mean dot F XML file and I have this main
00:25 - controller dot Java class which is blank
00:27 - right now and I also have created a main
00:30 - dot F XML file which is blank right now
00:34 - so first of all I'm going to open my
00:37 - main dot F XML file in scene builder and
00:41 - in here first of all I will go to the
00:45 - search option here and search for date
00:48 - picker and drag and drop into my anchor
00:52 - pane right now there are some properties
00:56 - which you can use for a date/time picker
00:59 - so first of all let's preview this
01:02 - date/time picker so go to preview here
01:05 - and then click show preview and you can
01:08 - see you can choose the dates like this
01:12 - right so the week information is not
01:15 - present here right so what you can do to
01:19 - you know show the week information you
01:22 - can select your date picker and then you
01:25 - can choose this option which says show
01:28 - week number okay and then it's going to
01:32 - you know show you the weeks also okay so
01:36 - just check this option and once again
01:38 - preview it and now you can see on the
01:41 - left hand side the week 45 46 47 and the
01:47 - week number right there are some other
01:51 - options also you can set the editable
01:54 - option which makes your date time picker
01:58 - editable or not editable by default its
02:02 - editable so you can you know enter your
02:05 - own date here for example 25 for 2015
02:12 - something like this
02:13 - okay and when you uncheck this option
02:16 - you can't edit your date so I am NOT
02:22 - able to enter any date you can just
02:24 - select the date but you cannot add it
02:27 - this date okay now let's see how we can
02:31 - you know get the date and print on some
02:35 - label so what I'm going to do I'm going
02:38 - to take a label from here and then I'm
02:43 - going to name my label for example date
02:48 - and the label ID also I'm going to
02:51 - change label ID will be show date okay l
02:57 - BL for label right and the ID for the
03:02 - date picker I'm going to give it as for
03:05 - example D P for date picker right
03:09 - save your code and one more thing we
03:11 - must do here is to connect our
03:13 - controller to F XML file so go to
03:16 - controller here and choose application
03:18 - dot main controller now save your code
03:21 - here and go to your project and refresh
03:25 - your project and then go to your main
03:28 - controller dot Java class and in here
03:31 - just declare this date picker and label
03:35 - okay so at the rate FX um private date
03:39 - picker DP which is the ID which we have
03:45 - given right and in the same way we will
03:47 - declare the label so just declare a
03:51 - label and the name of the label was just
03:55 - see the label name here just copy the
03:58 - same name and paste it here okay and
04:01 - import the label from JavaFX scene
04:04 - controls now we are going to create
04:07 - public void method for listening to the
04:12 - date/time picker right so it will be
04:15 - public void and the name is for example
04:19 - show date okay and it's going to take
04:24 - one argument which is
04:26 - action event and give the argument name
04:30 - for example event and then what we can
04:33 - do here is we can you know get the value
04:37 - which we have selected from the date
04:40 - picker something like this so you need
04:43 - to include our local date class so just
04:48 - use local date and name it as for
04:53 - example LD for local date is equal to
04:56 - take your DP which is date picker right
05:00 - dot get value okay so it's going to
05:04 - return you the date whatever you have
05:06 - selected in the form of local date right
05:09 - now you can take your label and then set
05:14 - the text on this label something like
05:17 - this so take your LD variable which is
05:20 - local date variable and then call a
05:23 - method called two string which is to
05:25 - convert this to string right save your
05:28 - code and one more thing you need to do
05:30 - here is you need to link this function
05:33 - from your date picker right so just
05:37 - select your date picker and then go to
05:39 - the code and in the on action you just
05:42 - need to choose this show date method
05:44 - from here save your code and refresh
05:47 - your project and then run it so right
05:52 - click run as java application and our
05:56 - app is running now so I'm going to
05:58 - choose some date and now you can see the
06:01 - date is printed here right some other
06:04 - date it's printed here and you can
06:08 - choose any other date which will be
06:11 - printed here so this was a short video
