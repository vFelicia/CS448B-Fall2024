00:01 - hey all welcome to programming knowledge
00:03 - hope you all doing good so in this
00:06 - tutorial we are going to see how we are
00:08 - going to convert like from a text to
00:11 - speech so before doing that I would like
00:14 - to tell you that you need to install pi
00:16 - PI audio and pi speech so in order to
00:20 - install that you need to go to terminal
00:21 - and I don't ask let's see
00:25 - pip install PI audio as I have already
00:30 - installed so if I'm going to install
00:33 - again so it's not so you can install PI
00:37 - audio and PI speech as well by writing
00:39 - down install PI speech pip install PI
00:42 - speech so these are the two common
00:45 - things that you are going to install and
00:47 - you can also install speech recognition
00:49 - if you are going to do speed ignition so
00:53 - this is these are the three common
00:55 - things required for speech recognition
00:58 - that is you are going to use now in this
01:02 - today we are going to look for text that
01:05 - is going to be provided in the program
01:07 - and when running the program an audio
01:11 - will pop up with that message so let's
01:15 - go ahead and no write down the code for
01:17 - running the program as I'm using Windows
01:20 - 10 so I'm going to write a code for the
01:24 - windows 10 and similarly we have
01:26 - different code available for different
01:28 - environments like Linux Ubuntu we have
01:30 - mac OS and similar and so on after your
01:34 - OS know for writing for running the code
01:37 - in a Windows 10 I am going to write the
01:41 - code first I am going to import win32
01:46 - comm dot client as when CL so we have
01:56 - important up in title Condor client and
02:00 - now I am going to use a variable called
02:01 - speak and inside that I am going to use
02:04 - this VIN CL which we have imported and
02:10 - I'm going to the dispatch and inside
02:13 - this I'm going to use the SAP I let's
02:17 - say SAP i dog SP voice so one sliding
02:26 - down this the next time what we are
02:29 - going to is we are going to use the
02:31 - speed which we have created followed by
02:34 - trot operator and we are going to use
02:37 - the speak with s as a caps and inside
02:42 - that we are going to provide our message
02:44 - that will be converted into voice and it
02:48 - will be running through the program so
02:51 - let's go ahead let's say hello world
02:54 - hello all welcome to programming
02:59 - knowledge here we go
03:08 - so I have done down hello welcome to
03:11 - programming knowledge so what will
03:14 - happen by using these three lines of
03:17 - code I am going to run the program and
03:19 - hello world welcome to programming
03:21 - knowledge will be popping up so let's
03:28 - now go ahead and see whether we get this
03:31 - hello all welcome to programming
03:32 - knowledge
03:42 - hello all welcome to programming
03:45 - knowledge I've heard the system saying
03:51 - as hello whoa hello all welcome to
03:53 - programming knowledge so this is taking
03:55 - from here from speak dot speak so by
03:59 - using these three lines of code we like
04:03 - we converted texts from converted from a
04:05 - text to a voice by importing this mean
04:08 - 30 to convert client has been CL and
04:11 - then we have created available called
04:13 - speak and use the of in CL dot Vince er
04:16 - which we created dot dispatch and yeah
04:20 - so we have also use app i dot SP voice
04:24 - so this is how you're going to run the
04:27 - program you can also change the
04:28 - statements as as you want my name is
04:31 - Samuel you can die down and then like
04:34 - can run the program and get to hear the
04:36 - your name like which is my name is
04:38 - Samuel so that's it for today hope you
04:42 - like this sweet and short tutorial about
04:44 - converting from a text to a speech in
04:48 - the coming two days I'll be coming with
04:49 - more interesting stuffs for learning the
04:53 - program and if you are if you are
04:55 - running for the other environments
04:58 - there'll be a different code for it so
05:00 - for Python for Linux there'll be a
05:03 - different code for an in the program so
05:05 - as this is a Windows 10 one so I have
05:07 - used these two lines of code following
05:09 - the program so thank you guys thank you
05:12 - for joining with programming all I'll
05:13 - see you next to do is
