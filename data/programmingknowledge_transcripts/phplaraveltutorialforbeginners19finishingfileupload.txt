00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is the last part of our
00:06 - laravel for beginners tutorial and in
00:09 - this video we're going to continue
00:11 - working on with our image feature so in
00:15 - the previous video we have added the
00:17 - display image and actually added the
00:20 - feature of uploading an image by
00:24 - creating a post so when adding a post we
00:27 - can have we now have the option to
00:29 - browse an image and then include that
00:32 - image and save that into our database so
00:37 - now let's continue working on with this
00:39 - so if we try to view the actual post so
00:44 - we want to also add the image here and
00:49 - the individual post so let's go back to
00:53 - our code editor and try to add that so
00:58 - this is the index that played that PHP
01:02 - and then we're just going to open up the
01:05 - show that yeah show that played that PHP
01:10 - so in here we have displayed we're
01:15 - displaying the post title and the post
01:19 - body of our post so again we're just
01:23 - going to add the image on top of our
01:28 - post so in order for us to do that let's
01:31 - just add a div here so this will be I
01:36 - think before the body tag so Dave and
01:39 - then this hope this will be row and
01:43 - another column or then for a column so
01:48 - called
01:50 - MD shelve and then we're just going to
01:54 - add the image here where you can just
01:57 - copy the tab coming from here so and
02:04 - then the width is hundred-percent and
02:06 - then we're getting the actual or the
02:10 - physical image
02:13 - coming from our cover underscore images
02:16 - directory so let's try to preview this
02:19 - in refresh so now we have the image so
02:25 - the title and then the image of our post
02:27 - and of course the body of our post and
02:30 - then the meta tag meta information with
02:35 - just a written on with a date okay so
02:40 - another thing for this feature is that
02:45 - we need to add this in our create or
02:47 - edit because for now we don't have the
02:50 - element to edit or update the image that
02:54 - has been uploaded so let's go back to
02:58 - our code editor and God the final
03:03 - element in here so the same with the
03:06 - create that laid that based me we're
03:09 - just going to copy this arm group and
03:14 - then Eddie near end it that way that PHP
03:20 - and just before the submission of the
03:25 - page you can place the cover image file
03:30 - input element and then of course we need
03:33 - to change the something here for our Inc
03:40 - type so it should be of course
03:44 - multi-part for data so we're just going
03:48 - to copy this one and paste it here so
03:57 - Inc type equals this multi-part slash
04:01 - form - data so we're just going to save
04:06 - this and refresh our page to show that
04:10 - we have already added the input file
04:13 - element so refresh so in here we have
04:20 - now the browse file input element
04:26 - we need to add some logic into our edit
04:29 - function from our post controller so
04:32 - let's go ahead and try to open up or
04:35 - post controller that page B and inside
04:39 - here in our edit function so we're going
04:45 - to add yeah the logic of our edit
04:50 - function or actually we're not editing
04:53 - the function edit we're actually going
04:57 - to modify the update function so all we
05:01 - have to do here is I think we just have
05:03 - to copy all the logic that we have in
05:07 - the store function so validate and then
05:19 - update okay so we're just going to paste
05:25 - here the validation and of course all
05:28 - the logic that will handle our file
05:30 - upload so this is going to be a bit
05:33 - different from the store logic because
05:36 - we're not going to have this line here
05:42 - which means that we don't want to update
05:46 - when the user has not uploaded the image
05:51 - so remove that and then we're just going
05:57 - to have another check here if the user
06:02 - has submitted the file or uploaded the
06:05 - files of the request if the request has
06:08 - fine so another cover image here that's
06:16 - the name of our file input element and
06:18 - then we're just going to get or set the
06:23 - cover image by using the file name to
06:28 - store so okay and save this so refresh
06:38 - view first opposed so we have here the
06:41 - post and then we have the actual post
06:46 - and then reckon edit that one and if we
06:49 - try to submit without selecting any
06:53 - image then we can just update the post
06:57 - but not updating the image right here
07:01 - but let's try to update the image so
07:06 - let's browse another image and then open
07:09 - and then submit post has been updated
07:14 - and as you can see the image share has
07:16 - been updated also because we have
07:18 - updated or uploaded an image coming from
07:23 - our edit page so the next thing is or
07:28 - delete okay so if we try to go to a post
07:33 - and we have this delete so whenever we
07:37 - have to delete this post we want to
07:40 - actually delete also this file coming
07:43 - from our project so if we try to open up
07:47 - or our project in our browser or M in
07:51 - our file directory we can see that we
07:56 - have here the public and then storage
08:01 - and then the cover images so this are
08:05 - the uploaded files in our project right
08:10 - so whenever a user wants to delete the
08:13 - post we we would also want our project
08:18 - to actually delete this files right here
08:20 - so in order for us to do that let's go
08:24 - back to our post controller and edit the
08:29 - delete function or destroy function
08:32 - right here so we're going to bring in
08:35 - first the storage library so if we're
08:40 - going to use illuminate slash support
08:46 - and then back slash massage
08:50 - backslash storage okay and then in our
08:56 - destroy function below so we're going to
09:01 - check if the user has uploaded the file
09:08 - for this particular post so that will be
09:11 - if this post cover image it's not equal
09:20 - to it's not equal to host and then user
09:27 - I mean not equal to no image that JPEG
09:34 - or jpg so this will be our default image
09:38 - when the user has not uploaded a file
09:43 - for their particular post so we don't
09:48 - want this to be deleted if the user
09:53 - hasn't uploaded a file so this will be
09:57 - storage and then delete so we're going
10:04 - to public and then cover images and of
10:10 - course the actual file name of our cover
10:17 - image so save this and then try to
10:23 - delete this post post has been removed
10:29 - or removed and as you can see the image
10:31 - from the cover images directory has been
10:35 - deleted one last concern also is if we
10:41 - try to go to our blog and add posts so
10:46 - say for example we're going to add first
10:49 - post here respose are the first post and
10:55 - then we're going to browse an image okay
10:59 - submit and also
11:04 - another one so second post body of
11:11 - second pose and then we're not going to
11:15 - browse or upload an image here so submit
11:19 - so as you can see we have here a broken
11:22 - image icon which means that the user has
11:27 - not uploaded image for this particular
11:30 - post so we don't we don't want that and
11:33 - we want to have a default image here so
11:38 - our default no image so let's go and
11:41 - search for a new image picture so that
11:46 - we will be able to have a default no
11:49 - image here so after finding a default no
11:53 - image so make sure to copy and paste
11:55 - that in your cover underscore images
11:57 - directory and this is what I have chosen
12:02 - from from new no image default and the
12:08 - file name is that J PG so we should be
12:13 - able to display this in our page so make
12:23 - sure to change this also to the right
12:25 - file extension and then save and then
12:30 - refresh so there you go we have now the
12:35 - no available image as our default image
12:39 - of our posts so I think that's all there
12:43 - is to it for this tutorial and this will
12:45 - end our tutorial for beginners tutorial
