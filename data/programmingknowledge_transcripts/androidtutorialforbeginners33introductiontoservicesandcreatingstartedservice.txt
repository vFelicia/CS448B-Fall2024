00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video and the next few
00:06 - coming videos we will see what are
00:09 - services in Android and how we can use
00:12 - services in Android so first of all what
00:15 - is a service in Android a service is an
00:19 - application component that can perform
00:22 - long-running operation in the background
00:25 - and does not provide a user interface so
00:29 - a service you can say it always run in
00:32 - the background and it has nothing to do
00:34 - with user interface for example a
00:37 - service can be downloading something in
00:41 - the background or long-running database
00:43 - operation in the background or you can
00:47 - say if you want to you know provide some
00:50 - music in the background then you can use
00:53 - service for that now a service can
00:58 - essentially take two forms so service
01:02 - can be started service or service can be
01:05 - bound service and in this video we will
01:08 - see what is a started service and how we
01:11 - can create the started service so a
01:14 - service is started when an application
01:17 - components such as an activity starts it
01:20 - by calling a method called start service
01:24 - method ok and once this service is
01:28 - started it can run in background
01:31 - indefinitely unless and until it's
01:34 - destroyed by some component ok and what
01:39 - is a bound service a service is called
01:42 - bound when an application component
01:44 - binds to it by calling bind service
01:47 - method so this we will see in the later
01:50 - video but in this video we will see what
01:52 - is a started service and how we can
01:55 - create it now to create a service in
01:58 - Android we need to subclass from a class
02:02 - called service ok and once you supplies
02:06 - from the service class the most
02:09 - important callmax method you should
02:11 - overwrite are
02:13 - on start command on bind on create
02:16 - method and on destroy method okay so
02:21 - this on start command we'll start your
02:24 - service and on destroy method will
02:27 - destroy your service on create method if
02:31 - you want to do some initialization for
02:34 - your service you can do it here and on
02:36 - bind service you are used to create bind
02:40 - services but you must implement this
02:44 - even if you are creating started
02:46 - services so now let's create a status
02:50 - service in our Android application so I
02:53 - have this blank project and in here I
02:57 - will drag and drop two buttons first
03:00 - button 1 + button 2 and I will change
03:04 - the text of this button as start service
03:06 - and the second button text I will name
03:09 - it as top service ok so we have 2 button
03:13 - start service and stop service ok
03:16 - and then I will go to the design of this
03:19 - activity and in here I will add one more
03:24 - attribute here and this attribute while
03:26 - we will call on click attribute so on
03:30 - click and what method we want to you
03:35 - know perform when this button is clicked
03:37 - let's say it's thought service method
03:41 - and same we want to do with the button
03:44 - which is top service so we will call a
03:47 - method on click which will be a stop
03:51 - service okay so stop service ok now we
03:56 - want to go to our java mainactivity.java
04:01 - class so go to main activity dot java
04:04 - class and in here we will create these
04:07 - two methods so first was start service
04:11 - methods so public void thought service
04:14 - and we will call this view and our
04:18 - second method was stop service ok so i
04:21 - will just copy this method and paste it
04:23 - just below it and this method
04:26 - we'll be stopped service so once we have
04:30 - created these two methods start service
04:33 - and stop service now we can create a
04:36 - class which will subclass from service
04:39 - class okay so I will go to here in this
04:44 - package and I will right click here and
04:47 - I will create a new Java class where my
04:51 - main activity dot Java class is and I
04:54 - will name it as for example the service
04:58 - ok and I will create it and it will
05:00 - create this class called the service and
05:03 - we want to extend from this service
05:06 - class right so extend and we want to
05:11 - extend from service class so extend from
05:13 - service and once you extend from it you
05:16 - will see it will show this little error
05:18 - with this little bulb because there is a
05:21 - method we must implement so just click
05:25 - this bulb and just click implement
05:29 - method and this method we must implement
05:32 - which is on bind even if we are creating
05:36 - a started service we must implement this
05:40 - or overwrite this ok so now this error
05:43 - is gone now we will just add our three
05:47 - more method which we should implement
05:50 - first was on create right so on create
05:55 - second was on destroy or first let's
06:00 - create on start so on start command and
06:06 - the third was on destroy so on destroy
06:11 - ok so once you created or once you
06:16 - implement these methods what we can do
06:19 - is I told you you can start a service
06:22 - using this on start command and you can
06:25 - destroy a service using this on destroy
06:29 - command ok so we will do just the same I
06:32 - will delete this line and what we can do
06:36 - is we can
06:38 - create a toast so we know that the
06:41 - service is started so toast dot make
06:47 - text and in here we will pass the
06:50 - context of this class which is this
06:54 - class itself and the second is our
06:57 - message so we can say service started
07:01 - and the third argument will be toast
07:07 - dot length long for example okay dot
07:12 - show and next what we can do here is we
07:16 - will return a constant here so return
07:19 - and we will return a constant call start
07:23 - sticky now what is this constant so when
07:26 - you press your control button and click
07:30 - this constant we will go to the
07:33 - definition of this constant and here you
07:35 - will see this mode makes sense for the
07:38 - things that will be explicitly started
07:41 - and stopped to run for arbitrary period
07:45 - of time and that's what we are exactly
07:48 - doing okay so that's why we are
07:51 - returning this constant called
07:54 - start sticky here okay and inside this
07:59 - ondestroy method what we want to do is
08:02 - we want to display this toast message
08:06 - once again but this time we will say
08:08 - that the service is destroyed okay
08:12 - so we know when service started and when
08:15 - service is destroyed now once we have
08:19 - these methods implemented we will go to
08:22 - main activity dot Java file where we
08:25 - have defined our start service and stop
08:28 - service methods and in here we can call
08:30 - this service or we can start this
08:33 - service using our intent objects so we
08:36 - will create an object of intent so
08:40 - intent intent is equal to new intent and
08:45 - it takes first of all the context so
08:50 - first of all they
08:51 - and the second argument will be the
08:55 - service class okay so the service with
08:59 - capital T the service dot plus okay and
09:05 - once you create an object of this intent
09:09 - you can start service by using this
09:12 - intent so you can just pass this intent
09:15 - object here and you will be good to go
09:18 - same we want to do in the stop service
09:22 - method and this time instead of starting
09:25 - this service we you just want to stop it
09:28 - so just do stop service okay so this
09:33 - will start your service and this will
09:35 - stop your service and make sure this
09:38 - name matches the name you have declared
09:42 - here okay so stop service and start
09:46 - service should match these method names
09:49 - once everything is done we just need to
09:53 - do one more thing
09:54 - we just need to go to manifest dot XML
09:57 - file and in here inside our application
10:01 - we need to create a tag called
10:05 - service or we need to add our element
10:08 - called service so just add service and
10:11 - the service name is the service because
10:15 - our class name is the service here okay
10:18 - and we will close this service and one
10:22 - more thing you can do here is you can
10:25 - add a attribute called Android export
10:31 - so Android exported and make it false
10:36 - and what this will do is it will prevent
10:39 - the other apps or other activities to
10:43 - use this service okay so once you have
10:47 - done that now let's run our app so now
10:52 - our app is running so when I click this
10:54 - start service button I click the start
10:57 - service button it shows service started
11:00 - but it's running in the background so
11:03 - how we can check that the service
11:05 - is running what you can do is you can go
11:09 - to the settings of your phone so so go
11:14 - to settings and inside settings just
11:18 - click this option called apps and inside
11:22 - the apps there are downloaded apps and
11:25 - there are running apps so just click
11:27 - running apps here and these are the apps
11:31 - which are running so you can see service
11:33 - demo here one process and one service is
11:36 - running ok now for example I close this
11:40 - service demo app so I'm going to close
11:44 - this service demo app and now I will go
11:48 - to the setting and still this service is
11:51 - running now to destroy this service I
11:54 - will start my service demo once again so
11:59 - I will start my service demo app from
12:02 - here and I will click stop service
12:06 - button and you can see service destroyed
12:09 - and once again I will go to the settings
12:11 - and now you can see this service is
12:15 - destroyed and we cannot see this service
12:18 - once again start the service by using
12:21 - this service demo and go to the setting
12:24 - and you can see the service is started
12:28 - and once you go to the demo and stop the
12:32 - service this will be destroyed ok and do
12:37 - remember if you don't stop this service
12:40 - it will keep on running for indefinite
12:43 - time ok
12:45 - so in this way you can use started
12:50 - service in Android I hope you have
