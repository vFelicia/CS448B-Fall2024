00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to install
00:05 - code blocks for compiling C and C++
00:08 - program on your Fresh open to operating
00:12 - system and I will also show you how to
00:14 - run your first hello world C++ program
00:19 - so let's get started once you have
00:22 - opened your open to operating system go
00:24 - to software open to software Center here
00:28 - and click it
00:31 - and it will open the open to operating
00:34 - system and open to software Center here
00:38 - and at the top you can search for the
00:40 - software so in the search tab here just
00:46 - write code
00:52 - blocks and it will search for the code
00:55 - blocks
00:56 - IDE so you can just select
01:00 - the first option from the softwares here
01:04 - and just go here and you will see the
01:08 - install button here you just need to
01:10 - press this install button and it will
01:14 - start
01:24 - installing you may need to give your uh
01:28 - root password so so I give my password
01:31 - of my open to operating
01:35 - system and I authenticate my
01:40 - password and now you can see it
01:44 - starts installing code blocks on my
01:48 - Ubuntu operating system it may take few
01:51 - seconds to install it
01:58 - fully
02:02 - now when you see here that your code
02:05 - block is installed and you can see here
02:07 - remove button so if you if your code
02:10 - block is installed then you will be able
02:12 - to see this remove and by pressing this
02:14 - remove button you can remove the code
02:17 - blocks also now once you have installed
02:20 - code blocks you can open code blocks uh
02:24 - in two ways one option is go to here
02:28 - Dash home and and click it and in here
02:33 - type code blocks and here you will be
02:36 - able to see code blocks IDE and you can
02:40 - open it from
02:42 - here and it starts code
02:46 - block okay so first uh when you are
02:51 - starting your code blocks it will tell
02:54 - you that which compiler is detected in
02:57 - your open to operating system gnu CC
03:01 - compile C GCC compiler is for compiling
03:04 - C and C++ program on Linux operating
03:07 - system which is already there in my in
03:11 - my computer so I click
03:15 - okay and it opens
03:19 - this code blocks IDE
03:22 - just close them all and the second
03:27 - option if you want to um open code
03:31 - blocks IDE then you can just open the
03:36 - terminal and when the terminal is uh
03:40 - open then you can just
03:45 - type the code
03:49 - blocks so I will show you how you can do
03:54 - it so once your terminal is open just
03:58 - write
04:01 - code blocks and let me close this code
04:04 - blocks so that you will be able to
04:08 - see so I have written code blocks here
04:10 - and I click enter
04:14 - button and you can see by this way also
04:19 - you can start your code blocks from the
04:23 - terminal
04:24 - also and it opens the same code blocks
04:28 - IDE
04:30 - one more thing you can do is when you go
04:33 - to this Dash home you can see the icon
04:36 - of code blocks you can uh just select
04:40 - this code blocks and drag and drop into
04:43 - your tool strip here so you don't have
04:47 - to go to uh this Dash home again and
04:49 - again and just click it from here start
04:52 - it from here or you don't need to open
04:55 - this code block from this terminal also
04:59 - so these are the two things to remember
05:02 - and once you freshly install code blocks
05:05 - it will also open this code blocks um
05:08 - website and you will be able to see all
05:10 - the informations about code blocks here
05:13 - now once your code blocks is open now we
05:19 - uh create a new project so you can
05:22 - create a new project from here also or
05:26 - you can just go
05:28 - to
05:30 - here in the file and go to new and click
05:36 - new
05:38 - project and here you can see so many
05:42 - options to uh
05:47 - select but for the first time we are
05:51 - going to uh here in the category and we
05:54 - can filter the categories from here and
05:57 - I select the console and now the options
06:01 - are filtered I select console
06:05 - application and click
06:07 - go and now it will uh start my console
06:13 - application so I click
06:14 - next and this is a C++ application
06:18 - that's why I click
06:20 - next and here I will give the name of my
06:22 - project
06:23 - so uh I will write
06:28 - my
06:31 - first
06:33 - program and now I click next and here is
06:40 - option folder to create a project in so
06:44 - you can give the name of the folder in
06:46 - which you want to create your project so
06:50 - for example I choose
06:53 - my document folder you can choose any
06:57 - folder if you want and and click okay
07:00 - and I will click
07:02 - next and here it shows you which
07:05 - compiler you want to use by default I
07:09 - have GCC compiler for compiling C and
07:11 - C++ programs so I don't touch anything
07:15 - here I will click
07:18 - finish
07:20 - and your project is created here and by
07:25 - default it creates a simple hello world
07:27 - program so what you need to do is just
07:32 - go to here at the top and just click
07:38 - build and click
07:41 - build and your program is building and
07:45 - here you can see it's saying zero errors
07:49 - right so you your your program has zero
07:52 - errors and now you can run your program
07:55 - so you can just go to builds once again
07:59 - and and you can see the option run and
08:02 - just click this run
08:04 - button and it opens the console
08:07 - application and here you see that your
08:11 - hello world program is successfully
08:14 - running right now so in this way you can
08:16 - install code blocks on your open to
08:18 - operating system and run your first
08:21 - hello world program I hope you have
08:23 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
08:24 - and subscribe and bye for now
