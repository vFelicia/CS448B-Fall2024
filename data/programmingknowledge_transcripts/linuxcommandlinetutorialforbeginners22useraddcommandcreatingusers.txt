00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:03 - beginners and in this video we will
00:05 - learn how to use user add command create
00:09 - users in Linux so to create a user we
00:13 - can use a command called user add and
00:17 - with this command we use some flags and
00:21 - the user name to create a user so let's
00:25 - see how we can create a user using this
00:28 - command so you just need to type this
00:30 - command which is user add and then the
00:33 - name of the user the name of the user
00:36 - can be anything for example mark or user
00:40 - one or anything which you want so this
00:44 - is the user name which you want to give
00:46 - so I want to give the user name for
00:49 - example mark ok
00:50 - and then the second flag which you can
00:54 - use is - M flag right and what this flag
00:59 - is going to do is it's going to create a
01:03 - default home directory for this user
01:07 - right so we are going to see once this
01:09 - command is executed that's that the home
01:13 - directory with this name will be created
01:15 - whenever we will see the home
01:18 - directories right now the next command
01:21 - is - s command and this is the command
01:26 - for the default shell okay so this - s
01:31 - command is used for allowing the user to
01:36 - use the shell whatever we provide after
01:39 - this flag so generally we give the bash
01:43 - sub in forward slash bash here so
01:49 - something like this okay so this is most
01:52 - commonly used you know shell so I'm
01:55 - going to use this now the next command
01:58 - is - G this is next flag I beg your
02:03 - pardon and this is the default user flag
02:07 - and after this after space after this
02:10 - flag whatever user
02:12 - you type the user will be assigned that
02:15 - group so the default group is users and
02:20 - I would recommend that you always use
02:24 - the minus G flag this users group which
02:29 - is correct to use there is also some
02:33 - more flags for example minus C for
02:36 - providing the comments you can provide
02:39 - any comments here for this user for
02:43 - example I want to give some comment my
02:47 - comment for example right so any comment
02:51 - can be given to the user using this flag
02:54 - - see ok now there are much more flags
02:59 - you can use for example - G for giving
03:04 - the user defined group or assigning the
03:06 - user defined group which we are not
03:08 - going to use but just use man command on
03:12 - with this user add command and you will
03:15 - be able to see what are the you know
03:17 - flags which you can use with this user
03:20 - and come on and because we are creating
03:24 - the user we need to create user with our
03:27 - root you know access so you just need to
03:30 - write sudo in front of this command in
03:33 - order to create this user because you
03:37 - don't want to you know allow anybody to
03:40 - create the user the root user can you
03:43 - know create the user right so this is
03:47 - the command sudo and then the user add
03:51 - command then the name of the user then
03:53 - the flag M is used for creating the
03:57 - default home directory as is for default
04:00 - shell - G is for the default group - C
04:04 - is for the comment and then you can
04:06 - press the Enter key which is going to
04:08 - ask for your password and then press
04:11 - enter once again this is going to create
04:14 - this user
04:16 - now just do LS and then forward slash
04:20 - home and you can see my new user here is
04:25 - created with
04:26 - the name mark which is this name so this
04:30 - directory is created in our home folder
04:32 - for the new user right but you may ask
04:36 - that we haven't provided any password to
04:40 - this user so whenever this user wants to
04:43 - login
04:43 - he will log in with the username and the
04:46 - password but we haven't provided any
04:48 - password here so this password can be
04:51 - you know given to the user with the
04:54 - command called the pass WD okay not W
05:00 - key but WT okay so when you give this
05:03 - command as it is then it it will allow
05:07 - you to change the you know password for
05:11 - the you root user but when you use this
05:14 - command with the argument for example I
05:17 - will use this command pass WT with the
05:22 - user name mark then this will allow me
05:25 - to change the password of the mark right
05:29 - and then you also need to use sudo
05:32 - command because you may have to give the
05:35 - root X's in order to change the password
05:38 - of the user right so whenever you use
05:42 - this like this then it will allow you to
05:45 - change your password and whenever you
05:47 - give the name of the user then it will
05:49 - allow you to change the password of the
05:52 - user
05:52 - ok so press enter and now it says enter
05:56 - the new password so give any password
05:59 - whichever you want to give to the user
06:01 - for example I will give a simple
06:03 - password here and I will press ENTER and
06:06 - then I need to retype this password so I
06:09 - will retype this password and press
06:11 - enter and you can see it says password
06:14 - updated successfully so now for the new
06:18 - user you can give this name and whatever
06:21 - password you have assigned to this user
06:23 - to the new user and he will be able to
06:26 - login with this username and password
06:29 - okay so this is how you can create a
06:32 - user in Linux in the next video we will
06:35 - see how we can remove a user in Linux
06:39 - and I will recommend that you can create
06:42 - you know four or five users so we can
06:45 - play with these users okay so with the
06:48 - same command you can create multiple
06:50 - users and these users we can use in the
06:54 - next video to remove them okay so I hope
06:58 - you enjoyed this video please rate
