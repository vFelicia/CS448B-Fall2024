00:00 - hey guys when could be the next video on
00:02 - OpenCV t-told for beginners using Python
00:05 - so in the last two videos we have seen
00:08 - how to capture videos from our default
00:12 - camera device or how to add geometric
00:17 - shapes on the images now in this video
00:21 - we are going to combine the knowledge we
00:23 - have gained in the last two videos so if
00:26 - you haven't seen the last two videos I
00:29 - will recommend you to watch those videos
00:31 - and then come to this video so in this
00:35 - video we will see how we can just draw
00:39 - something on a video and more
00:42 - specifically the aim of this video is
00:45 - how to show the current date and time on
00:50 - a live video so now in the last video we
00:55 - have seen how to draw shapes on images
01:00 - and we have also seen how to put text on
01:04 - our images right so let's say we just
01:08 - want to print the value of width and
01:11 - height on the default camera and let me
01:14 - just remove this line which we have used
01:17 - to convert the BGR image to the
01:19 - greyscale image so we will just see the
01:24 - colored BGR image so now what we want to
01:27 - do is we want to print the width and
01:30 - height which we get from these
01:33 - properties on our video which we are
01:37 - capturing so in the last video we have
01:39 - already seen that we can use a method
01:43 - which is seaweed to dot put text yeah so
01:49 - this method we have seen in the last
01:51 - video and first of all we will define
01:54 - the font which we will pass to our put
01:59 - text method so the font I'm using here a
02:02 - CV 2 dot font Hershey underscore simplex
02:06 - and now the first argument here will be
02:09 - the frame which we are capturing because
02:11 - every frame is just
02:13 - an image and a video is the combination
02:16 - of multiple images so the first argument
02:19 - here will be the frame the second
02:22 - argument here will be your text so the
02:25 - text which we want to show here is let's
02:29 - say width and height so let's define a
02:32 - variable which we want to show on our
02:36 - video so let's say the variable name is
02:38 - text and the first of all I'm going to
02:41 - define the width so just say width and
02:45 - then we are going to provide the value
02:48 - of the width using the concatenation
02:51 - operator now because this value will be
02:55 - in integer and we want to convert it to
02:59 - the string so we will use the STR method
03:03 - to convert the integer to the string and
03:06 - then we can pass the width here inside
03:11 - our string variable once again we will
03:14 - use the concatenation operator and then
03:17 - let's provide some space here and then
03:20 - we will just write the height : and then
03:24 - once again the concatenation operator
03:26 - and once again we will use this string
03:30 - method and inside the string method we
03:32 - will now take the height okay
03:36 - and now we will pass this text to our
03:39 - put text argument now the third argument
03:42 - is the coordinate so let's say I want to
03:45 - just put this text at the coordinate
03:48 - admin comma 50 the fourth argument is
03:52 - the font which we have already declared
03:54 - the fifth argument is the thickness so
03:59 - let's say the thickness we want is 1 and
04:01 - then the color so let's say the color we
04:04 - want is 0 comma 255 comma 255 and then
04:11 - the thickness so I think the thickness
04:13 - comes after the color and the value 1 we
04:17 - have set for the font scale so you can
04:19 - change the font scale 1 2 3 4 any font
04:23 - you can change it from here so this
04:25 - value 1 is for the font ski
04:27 - and the value we are providing right now
04:30 - is for the thickness so let's say the
04:33 - thickness is 2 and the last argument
04:35 - here will be the line type so I'm going
04:37 - to just provide the line type CB 2 dot
04:41 - line underscore a a so what do you think
04:46 - well this text will be printed on our
04:49 - image or not so it will not print yet
04:52 - because we need to write on the frame
04:55 - this text so we need to just write frame
04:59 - is equal to and then put the text on the
05:03 - same frame which we are seeing right now
05:06 - so now this will work and let me just
05:09 - break this line so you will see all the
05:12 - code and now let's run the code and
05:15 - let's see what happens when we run the
05:18 - code so let me run this script and you
05:20 - will see here that now we are seeing the
05:24 - width and height on top of this video
05:28 - which is 1 2 8 0 and the height is 720
05:32 - point 0 so this is how you can show text
05:36 - on your video which you are capturing
05:39 - from the back camera or from the video
05:43 - file now let me just comment these lines
05:46 - of code because they are changing the
05:48 - resolution of our video and it's not
05:52 - fitting this video screencast so I have
05:56 - commented this code and now let's do
05:59 - something more interesting so now let's
06:02 - say we want to show the current date and
06:05 - time on the video and you might have
06:08 - guessed how to print it but let me show
06:11 - you if you don't know how to print the
06:14 - date and time on your live video so
06:18 - first of all we are going to import the
06:21 - package which is available inside Python
06:24 - which is date time and then we are going
06:28 - to create this date time variable let's
06:31 - say the date time variable
06:34 - we'll be date T and then first of all we
06:38 - are going to use the STR method to
06:41 - convert the date and time to string and
06:44 - then there is a method inside this
06:48 - date/time library so we just need to
06:51 - write date/time dot date/time once again
06:53 - and then the method called now which is
06:57 - going to show you the current date and
07:01 - time so once we have converted our
07:04 - current date and time to the string
07:08 - variable then we can pass this variable
07:11 - as the second argument and now let's run
07:14 - the script and let's see what happens
07:17 - once again so I am running the script
07:20 - and now you will see that it shows the
07:23 - current time and current date on the
07:27 - video itself so this is how you can put
07:31 - the text on your video you can even put
07:35 - some shapes which we have seen in the
07:38 - last video on this video itself so you
07:41 - can put the line or the rectangle or the
07:45 - circle on your video which you are
07:48 - capturing from the camera or some file
07:51 - so this was some kind of a mini project
07:55 - which we have created from the knowledge
07:57 - which we have gained from the last two
08:00 - videos I hope you have enjoyed this
08:02 - video and I will see you in the next
08:04 - video
08:13 - you
