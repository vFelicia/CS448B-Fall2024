00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - mongod DB compass on your Mac operating
00:07 - system so now our mongod deban is
00:10 - running but how you can connect to uh
00:13 - your mongod DB server using a client so
00:17 - when you download mongod DB it only
00:20 - comes with the mongod DB server it
00:22 - doesn't come with mongod DB shell or
00:24 - mongod DB uh Compass which is the
00:27 - graphical user interface utility so once
00:30 - again go to your favorite browser and
00:31 - search for mongodb then click on the
00:33 - mongod db.com result then click on
00:36 - products here and then click on
00:38 - Community
00:41 - Edition here under Tools you will see
00:43 -  shell and DB Compass first
00:46 - of all Let's uh download the mongod DB
00:49 - Compass which is a GUI application so
00:51 - I'm going to select this and then when I
00:54 - scroll down I can see the version form
00:57 - will be Mac OS arm 64 M1 one for me
01:01 - because I'm using Apple silicon
01:03 - processor if you're using Intel choose
01:05 - the other version and then the package
01:08 - will be DMG click on download which is
01:10 - going to start the download of this DMG
01:13 - file and once this DMG file is
01:15 - downloaded let me click on this and it's
01:18 - going to start this mongodb Compass
01:20 - installer so the installation is simple
01:24 - you need to drag and drop this mongodb
01:27 - compass into your applications folder
01:29 - select mongod DB Compass press command
01:31 - key and then drag and drop this icon on
01:35 - top of the applications folder which is
01:37 - going to copy this uh mongod DB compass
01:39 - in your applications once that's done go
01:42 - to your Launchpad and you will see
01:44 - mongod DB Compass here click on
01:47 - it and it's going to start the mongod DB
01:50 - Compass now keep in mind I have this
01:53 - mongod demon running so I haven't
01:55 - cancelled this command so mongod demon
01:57 - is running in my case don't close this
02:00 - terminal otherwise mongod demon will
02:03 - close right so you can see this mongod
02:06 - demon is still running and then in uh
02:11 - the mongod DB Compass this is the
02:13 - connection string to connect to your
02:16 - local host mongod DB server instance so
02:20 - just leave it as default and then click
02:22 - on connect which is going to connect to
02:25 - your mongodb server instance and you can
02:28 - see by default you you have this admin
02:30 - config and local databases by default
02:34 - present in your mongodb servers so now
02:36 - you are connected to your uh mongodb
02:39 - server successfully using mongodb
02:42 - Compass you can also create a new
02:44 - database click on create database and
02:46 - then name your database for example demo
02:50 - you can also create a collection name
02:51 - for example names and then you can also
02:55 - choose if it's a Time series database I
02:57 - don't want this right now and then click
02:59 - click on create database and it's going
03:01 - to create this demo database with this
03:05 - um collection which is called
03:07 - names so everything is working fine now
03:11 - you can also use sh you can see
03:14 - this option here and it's for sh
03:18 - and you can use this command line tool
03:20 - to interact with your mongod DB uh
03:23 - server using the command utility so I'm
03:26 - going to just say show DBS here here
03:30 - which is going to show me the list of
03:32 - all the databases so when I press enter
03:34 - it's going to show me the list of all
03:35 - the databases the demo database I have
03:38 - created so you can see it shows me the
03:41 - demo database if I want to uh work with
03:45 - particular database I can use uh use
03:48 - command so use and then use demo I want
03:51 - to use the demo database and then press
03:54 - enter so I'm switched into the demo
03:57 - database then I can just say say show
04:01 - Collections and you can see it's autoc
04:04 - complete right so when I press Tab It
04:07 - Auto completes my command and it shows
04:09 - me the collection so you can use this
04:12 -  sh to uh use command line uh
04:17 - client with your mongod DB server if you
04:20 - are a fan of kui just use this one so
04:24 - after installing mongod DB Compass you
04:26 - will not even need the shell
04:27 - utility separately because this sh
04:30 - interface is already there but if you
04:32 - want to install shell separately
04:35 - without compass then you can go to
04:38 - shell under Tools and then download this
04:41 - ZIP file and then use command to
04:45 - uh interact with your mongod DB
04:48 - servers so that's it for this video I
04:50 - hope you've enjoyed this video and I
04:52 - will see you in the next
