00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners and in this video I am going
00:06 - to show you how we can use head and tail
00:09 - commands in Linux so head and tail
00:12 - commands generally we can use with files
00:15 - and the head and tail are actually doing
00:20 - the opposite of each other so the head
00:23 - command can be used to output the first
00:27 - part of the file and the tail command
00:30 - can be used to output or print the tail
00:35 - part or last part of the file now
00:38 - generally by default whenever you use a
00:41 - head or tail command they will print
00:43 - first ten lines using head command or
00:48 - last ten line using tail commands okay
00:51 - so let's see how we can use a head and
00:55 - tail command so what I am going to use
00:57 - do is I am going to go to the bar slash
01:02 - log directory of my system where lots
01:06 - and lots of log files are there okay so
01:09 - I am going to do LS and I can see so
01:12 - many log files are there right and I
01:16 - want to use the head and tail command to
01:19 - see the content of these files right so
01:23 - for example I will use head command and
01:26 - then for example let's see which file we
01:29 - want to see so there will be a file
01:33 - called D message file D mesg and just
01:37 - use head with this file so this is a
01:40 - file and you can use any other log file
01:45 - and this head file can be used in many
01:47 - ways but generally it's used with log
01:50 - files and other kind of files right so
01:53 - just write hat and the name of the log
01:56 - file you want to see and then press
01:58 - ENTER and it's going to show you the
02:00 - first 10 lines of this text file ok and
02:05 - the tail command can be used to show the
02:08 - last 10 lines so when I use instead of
02:11 - head
02:12 - I use tail the message and then it's
02:16 - going to show the last 10 lines of this
02:19 - D message file okay so let me clear the
02:23 - terminal once again now for example I
02:27 - want to change the number of lines I
02:31 - want to see okay so this is also
02:33 - possible for example I want to see just
02:36 - three lines are using head command so I
02:39 - can use head and then minus N and the
02:44 - number of line for example 3 I want to
02:46 - see first 3 lines and the name of your
02:50 - file so just write D message and press
02:53 - ENTER and it's going to show the first 3
02:56 - lines and same you can do with the tail
02:59 - command so you can just write tail and
03:02 - then minus and 3 and the name of the
03:06 - file is going to show you the last three
03:08 - lines of the file ok basically you can
03:12 - also use the stale or head command like
03:16 - this so just write tail and then minus
03:19 - the number of line you want to show you
03:21 - don't even need to use the N flag with
03:25 - it so the same output will be there ok
03:28 - so this can be used in this way also
03:33 - now the other use of this head and tail
03:38 - command is using the flag F so I'm going
03:42 - to once again clear the terminal and
03:44 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
03:46 - just use the tail command for example
03:50 - and then with minus F flag and then the
03:55 - name of the file for example so I'm
03:57 - going to just use this file once again
03:59 - and press ENTER and what it's doing is
04:02 - it's printing the last 10 line but it's
04:05 - not you know going out of the terminal
04:09 - output right so it's hanging around and
04:12 - it's going to watch for this file and
04:15 - whenever this file changes then this
04:18 - output will also change so it's going to
04:21 - append the last line for example is
04:24 - going to show you the
04:25 - last ten lines again okay so this F flag
04:30 - is for follow and it's going to show you
04:34 - the last ten line and this kind of you
04:38 - know tail with F can be used whenever
04:41 - you are doing input and output thing
04:44 - using some you know input source or
04:48 - output source using serial or you know
04:51 - any other you know communication you are
04:55 - doing with your Linux operating system
04:58 - so whenever you want to see the output
05:00 - what's the output is on the tail of your
05:04 - file then you can use the app flag so
05:08 - it's going to show you appended lines of
05:11 - code here also okay now one more thing
05:17 - you can do with the head and tail
05:19 - commands is you can use multiple files
05:22 - with healthy until command so for
05:25 - example I use head and then the name of
05:29 - the file first file I want to use is
05:30 - once again this file and the next file I
05:34 - want to use for example I can search for
05:37 - this file let's say you want to use this
05:43 - turn log file okay so the first file
05:48 - second file and you can use multiple
05:50 - files to see the first 10 lines of these
05:55 - files so I am going to just press ENTER
05:58 - and you can see first
06:00 - it has printed the first 10 line of the
06:03 - message file and then it has printed the
06:06 - 10 lines of this kernel log file ok so
06:11 - this is how also you can use this
06:14 - command once again I'm going to clear
06:17 - the clear the terminal and once again I
06:20 - can use this command but with this flag
06:24 - which shows the number of lines and just
06:27 - press Enter is going to show you the
06:29 - first 3 line from the D message command
06:31 - and first 3 line from the kernel log
06:34 - file
06:35 - okay so this is how you can use
06:39 - generally the head and tail commands in
06:41 - your Linux operating system I hope
