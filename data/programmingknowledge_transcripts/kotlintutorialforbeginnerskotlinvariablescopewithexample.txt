00:00 - in this video
00:01 - firstly we are going to see what is the
00:03 - scope of a variable and then we we will
00:07 - cover some uh few examples which which
00:10 - will help you get a better clarity of
00:12 - all this con all those concepts that we
00:14 - have learned in the particular playlist
00:16 - of
00:17 - introduction to kotlin okay
00:19 - so what is scope of a variable a scope
00:22 - of a variable is
00:24 - its visibility or a visibility of a
00:26 - particular variable within a piece of
00:28 - code
00:29 - so let us understand with it with this
00:32 - with the example okay so suppose
00:36 - this is a block one block of code one
00:38 - okay
00:40 - so
00:42 - and
00:43 - then there is a for loop and then in
00:45 - between inside the for loop there is a
00:48 - block of
00:49 - code two so uh as the variable a is
00:53 - defined in the main function outside the
00:55 - for loop
00:57 - so the
00:58 - variable a is visible to code one as
01:01 - well as the code two okay so the code
01:04 - one is this thing and the code two is
01:06 - particularly this thing okay or i can
01:08 - say the code one includes this also so
01:10 - basically the code 2 is the for loop
01:14 - and
01:17 - because the variable b
01:19 - is
01:20 - initialized in the
01:22 - for loop
01:23 - inside the loop body and
01:27 - so it is visible to visible only to the
01:31 - code b and not the code one and hence it
01:34 - should be used
01:35 - by
01:36 - this loop body only okay so the variable
01:41 - b cannot be used outside so i cannot use
01:45 - b is equals to 20 here
01:48 - okay when i uh
01:50 - do so it shows an error here because
01:53 - the b variable is not visible to
01:56 - outside the loop
01:58 - okay similarly
02:00 - when i define a function okay
02:03 - a function outside the main function and
02:05 - i
02:06 - use some variables in the
02:09 - other function so the variables which i
02:12 - have used in the other function are not
02:14 - visible to the main function
02:16 - and the body and the
02:18 - and the body of the main function okay
02:20 - so this is about the uh scope of a
02:23 - variable okay so uh now moving forward
02:26 - uh we will uh
02:28 - write a kotlin program to
02:31 - find a
02:33 - factorial of a particular number of a
02:35 - give of a particular number okay
02:37 - so kotlin
02:40 - program to
02:43 - find
02:45 - factorial
02:50 - of a
02:52 - number
02:54 - so in this program you will learn to
02:56 - find the factorial of a number using for
02:59 - loop or you can use while loop also
03:03 - and
03:04 - okay so what is a factorial so a
03:06 - factorial of a number n can be given by
03:09 - uh n factorial
03:11 - and it it is equals to
03:13 - 1 into 2
03:15 - into 3
03:17 - into 4
03:19 - and so on
03:21 - till
03:22 - n
03:23 - okay
03:25 - so
03:26 - now we have to think that how should we
03:29 - proceed in this particular question so
03:32 - uh uh for thinking this uh
03:35 - firstly i should think that uh one loop
03:38 - is required okay we cannot manually
03:40 - multiply the number with two and three
03:42 - and four okay also uh
03:45 - the the particular factor should be
03:47 - multiplied with the i with the
03:51 - incrementer
03:52 - okay
03:54 - so
03:55 - in this program we should we should use
03:58 - loop to loop through all the numbers
04:01 - between one to the given number
04:03 - okay whichever number has been given and
04:06 - uh
04:07 - the product of each number till the
04:10 - number is stored within a variable it
04:12 - must be stored within the variable
04:15 - okay so as we did in the uh
04:18 - as we did for finally finding the sum
04:21 - so uh initially i i'll declare the main
04:23 - function
04:25 - okay inside the main function there is a
04:28 - value
04:29 - num
04:30 - and that is defined so i have to find
04:32 - the
04:33 - factorial for the particular number 10.
04:37 - now i should define a particular
04:41 - variable
04:42 - let's say factorial okay
04:45 - variable let's say factorial in which
04:48 - the factorial is going to be
04:50 - stored
04:53 - okay
04:54 - now this factorial
04:57 - uh okay instead of 10 i i'll do it five
05:02 - okay so this factorial uh
05:04 - should be
05:06 - equals to one on in the starting because
05:09 - this is multiplication if this is if
05:11 - this was a sum as we did in the sum of n
05:13 - natural numbers we would have
05:14 - initialized it with 0 because
05:17 - it we would be adding something to it
05:19 - now
05:20 - we would be multiplying something to it
05:21 - so we have initially initialized it as
05:24 - one because anything multiplied to one
05:26 - is the particular thing
05:28 - okay similarly anything added to the
05:30 - zero is the particular number
05:33 - okay now after declaring a factorial
05:36 - variable uh we should declare we should
05:39 - use the for loop okay so for now
05:42 - from where we have to iterate so i have
05:44 - to iterate from
05:46 - one to
05:48 - the number particular okay
05:51 - so from i to the number
05:54 - uh
05:55 - the factorial okay
05:57 - the factorial
05:59 - is equals to
06:00 - the
06:01 - factorial into number
06:06 - okay so
06:07 - uh from starting we can see that uh
06:10 - what is two factorial
06:12 - or what is one factorial i'll say one
06:14 - factorial one factorial is
06:17 - one
06:18 - okay now what is 2 factorial
06:20 - 2 factorial is
06:22 - 2 into 1 factorial
06:26 - and what is 3 factorial
06:29 - 3 factorial is 3 into 2 into 1 and 2
06:32 - into 1 is any basically 2 factorial now
06:36 - what is 4 factorial
06:38 - 4 factorial is
06:40 - 4 into 3 into 2 into 1
06:42 - now what is 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 4 4
06:45 - into 3 into 2 into 1 so what is 3 into 2
06:47 - into 1 3 into 2 into 1 is 3 factorial
06:51 - okay so i can see that i can say that
06:53 - the factorial
06:55 - is equals to the previous factorial into
06:57 - the current number
06:59 - or instead of number i should have said
07:01 - here i
07:02 - okay that was my fault
07:04 - so
07:05 - what i can do here is i can just write
07:07 - factorial
07:10 - into equals to
07:12 - i
07:14 - okay clear
07:17 - and
07:18 - at the end
07:20 - i should write the print function
07:23 - so print ln
07:25 - uh
07:27 - pack
07:28 - to real
07:32 - of
07:34 - the number
07:39 - is equals to
07:42 - factorial so the factorial variable
07:48 - now
07:50 - what i should do is i should run this
07:52 - program
07:54 - okay
07:56 - so what is 5 factorial 5 factorial is
07:58 - basically 120 4 factorial is 24 okay so
08:02 - this program gives that factorial of 5
08:04 - is 120 so we have successfully
08:09 - made a program which prints the
08:11 - factorial of a particular number okay so
08:13 - that that is all for this video stay
08:15 - tuned
