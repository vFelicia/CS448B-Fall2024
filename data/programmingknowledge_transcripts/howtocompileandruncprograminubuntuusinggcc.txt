00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:03 - video I will show you how to install and
00:08 - compile
00:10 - c
00:12 - c program from
00:15 - your
00:16 - GCC
00:19 - compiler first step if you have
00:22 - installed open 2
00:25 - freshly or new version of open2 and you
00:29 - have fresh with open to you need to
00:38 - install build
00:40 - essential in your open system this build
00:44 - essential will install GCC and g++
00:48 - compiler into your system so from them
00:54 - you can compile your C and
00:57 - C++
00:58 - programs
01:02 - so WR P sudo app- getet installed build
01:08 - essential and press
01:14 - enter and ask me the permission yes
01:28 - working
01:38 - and it will be
01:45 - completed by the meantime the process is
01:48 - completing go to your
01:51 - folder and we will
01:54 - test a simple
01:57 - C program
02:00 - so create a new document in your home
02:04 - directory or wherever you
02:06 - want empty
02:11 - document and name it
02:14 - as
02:17 - test dot
02:23 - C so and open
02:28 - it
02:31 - by double
02:39 - clicking so go to your test do
02:45 - C file and make a simple hello world
02:51 - program include std. include STD
02:58 - li. in Main and print hello
03:02 - world and save this program
03:06 - here and then go to your browser by the
03:10 - meantime I think your build essential
03:13 - have have
03:17 - been installed so now
03:22 - on the
03:24 - terminal because this test. CPP file is
03:29 - on on my
03:32 - home
03:34 - folder so I don't need to go to the file
03:39 - but if it's located anywhere else just
03:44 - see the location and CD to the
03:48 - location and just right
03:54 - here
03:56 - GCC
03:58 - sorry
04:01 - just write
04:03 - GCC test.c which is your
04:07 - program and dash small o test this Dash
04:13 - small o
04:15 - test is the name of the executable
04:19 - file so when this test just c will be
04:23 - compiled it will be saved in the form of
04:27 - test.exe or executed
04:30 - file so and then press
04:35 - enter
04:39 - and if there is no
04:42 - error it will be compiled successfully
04:46 - now to run the test program you write
04:50 - dot slash and
04:53 - your executable file name in our
04:57 - case our executable file name name is
05:00 - this test so you'll
05:03 - write test and press enter and yes it
05:09 - shows hello
05:10 - world so in this way you can
05:13 - compile C program on your GCC
05:19 - compiler I hope this will help you in
05:22 - future for compiling the C programs and
05:26 - please write comment and subscribe and
05:29 - bye for now
