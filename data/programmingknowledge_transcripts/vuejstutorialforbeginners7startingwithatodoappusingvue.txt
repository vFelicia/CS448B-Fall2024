06:34 - label here
06:36 - so you can add this
06:40 - i hope this is fine yeah so you can
06:43 - refresh this page and here you can see
06:45 - now you can press ctrl shift i or
06:47 - inspect
06:48 - okay and what i'll do i'll move this to
06:52 - the right
06:53 - yes so here i have the like
06:56 - responsive design and i'll write move
06:59 - talk to the right
07:00 - yeah nice perfectly fine so here's more
07:03 - responsible we will try to make it more
07:04 - responsive
07:06 - so this is perfectly fine and this is
07:08 - the console
07:10 - so this is we can create a form
07:13 - now the very first thing what we can do
07:16 - is create
07:17 - a script so let's create a script here
07:20 - script and source
07:24 - is equal to index dot js
07:30 - and yeah perfectly fine but before the
07:33 - script
07:34 - we need to add a view js and with that
07:37 - is going to be in the development
07:38 - version
07:39 - so let's yeah
07:42 - so let's i'll add this
07:47 - i'll copy this and i'll paste it here
07:49 - before this script
07:52 - so when i refresh this page uh you'll
07:56 - see
07:57 - that uh like this is saying that you are
08:00 - running a view in development mode this
08:01 - is all we have wanted
08:03 - now what we can do uh we can create a
08:06 - new file
08:08 - uh like instance dot
08:12 - html we can create a new file in this
08:14 - folder
08:16 - and let's name this as to do app
08:22 - dot js so perfectly fine
08:25 - okay and what we can do
08:29 - uh i'll i'll i'll what i can do
08:33 - uh i'll try to maintain them inside a
08:35 - folder
08:37 - so now i have like i use the cut command
08:41 - and i'll make a new folder
08:44 - to do app perfectly fine now
08:47 - inside this to do app i'll paste them
08:51 - so now now you can see that i am inside
08:54 - a folder to do app and now they have two
08:56 - files due to app.html and to do app.js
08:59 - so uh so i am inside a folder
09:02 - so that should give you a better idea
09:04 - when you view the repository that the
09:06 - tool app would be inside the
09:08 - uh app.html and to do app.js
09:11 - so i can change this to
09:17 - i can change this to
09:20 - app.js so this is perfectly fine
09:25 - sorry
09:29 - to do app dot js
09:32 - perfectly fine okay now what we can
09:36 - do uh
09:39 - so let me refresh this page
09:42 - okay file not found yeah i'm i know why
09:46 - why the file will not be found because i
09:48 - made a new folder
09:50 - now when i go to the directory
09:53 - so here you can see i have a to-do app
09:57 - and inside the tool i have to do
09:58 - app.html so it works perfectly fine
10:01 - so one thing what we can do next is so
10:05 - we can add console
10:08 - dot dot
10:14 - and inside this i can type script
10:19 - started so when i refresh this
10:23 - i right click here inspect element and i
10:27 - can
10:27 - refresh i can see script sorted and this
10:30 - is from to app.js
10:32 - so this is all for this tutorial so this
10:35 - was like the
10:36 - like this tutorial for setting up the
10:37 - environment for this developing
10:39 - app and i'll catch you in the next
10:40 - tutorial thank you
