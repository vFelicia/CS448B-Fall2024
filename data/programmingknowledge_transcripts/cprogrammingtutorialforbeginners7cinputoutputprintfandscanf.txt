00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video this is John from programming
00:05 - knowledge and in this video guys we're
00:07 - gonna talk about the input and output in
00:10 - C programming language before we dive in
00:13 - into operators and how we can use
00:18 - operators in C programming language so
00:20 - basically we can use the function printf
00:23 - to display something in our screen just
00:25 - like what we have before so printf and
00:29 - then we can say hello world okay and
00:34 - then we can build and run this program
00:38 - and we can get the hello world string
00:41 - right here we use the printf function
00:45 - for that and now we're going to talk
00:48 - about the input because where we're
00:52 - trying to focus on the input because
00:56 - we're already familiar with the output
00:59 - side of C programming so we have used
01:02 - the printf to output something in our
01:05 - screen and then of course in order for
01:07 - us to ask input from the user we're
01:11 - going to use the scanf function okay so
01:14 - the way to use scanf function we can say
01:19 - here we can ask for a particular number
01:22 - so please enter a number okay and then
01:27 - we can add the escape character here for
01:31 - a new line and we can declare a variable
01:34 - here so for example in a and then we can
01:40 - get the value from the user by using the
01:45 - scanf function and then format specifier
01:49 - for our in variable or in value and
01:53 - comma and then of course the n symbol
02:00 - and the name of our of our variable a so
02:03 - basically what this means is that we're
02:06 - taking the address of variable a and
02:08 - then assign a value to that address
02:12 - whatever do user has inputted okay so
02:17 - and then we're going to end this with a
02:19 - semicolon
02:20 - and let's try this let's try to display
02:23 - the value that comes from the user okay
02:29 - so number the number is percent D format
02:40 - specifier for our in value and then
02:44 - comma and then and then the name of our
02:46 - variable which is a okay and then C
02:50 - Michael and so I remember to end every
02:54 - time or end every line with a semicolon
02:58 - okay and then we can build and run this
03:02 - application so there you go the program
03:07 - tried is trying to prompt us to input a
03:12 - number so so for example number five so
03:16 - number five is or the number is colon
03:20 - and then the value five which is coming
03:22 - from the user itself okay and now we can
03:27 - actually ask two numbers in the same
03:31 - line by using also the scanf function so
03:35 - in here we have like asked for a single
03:38 - number but what we can do is we can ask
03:42 - for two numbers just like please enter
03:48 - any two numbers okay and then we're just
03:57 - going to use the same function percent
03:59 - ask and F and then % d percent another
04:04 - percent D because we're asking two
04:07 - numbers and then in here we can say and
04:12 - symbol and then the value or the
04:17 - variable B which we will declare here on
04:21 - the top
04:22 - okay B and then we can declare another
04:25 - variable C and we can add the values or
04:31 - the numbers coming from the user so the
04:36 - number where the value C or the variable
04:40 - C we can assign a value to that which is
04:45 - the total of the two numbers a and B so
04:50 - that will be C equals a plus B so what
04:56 - we're doing here is that whereas I we're
04:59 - just assigning the value of the total of
05:02 - a and B into our AC variable okay so the
05:06 - total the total number is and then
05:13 - percent D and of course the value of RC
05:17 - okay which is again the total of our
05:20 - variables a and B okay so save this and
05:25 - then we can build and run our
05:28 - application so please enter any two
05:33 - numbers for example one in two so the
05:43 - total number is three okay so again like
05:50 - five and three so the total is 8 okay so
06:02 - as you can see we are getting the two
06:05 - numbers five and three and then we're
06:08 - displaying total which is eight okay so
06:13 - basically that's how you can ask or you
06:17 - know input something into our program
06:19 - because our program right now is asking
06:22 - for a for an input from our user okay
06:26 - and that's where we can you know apply
06:30 - the operators
06:32 - in our C program and we have different
06:37 - operators or type of operators in C so C
06:42 - programming language offers various
06:45 - types of operators having different
06:48 - functioning capabilities so the first
06:51 - one is the arithmetic operators so we
07:00 - have used the addition operator right
07:04 - there by you know assigning the value of
07:07 - a plus B to C okay and then we also have
07:11 - the relational relational operators okay
07:20 - but resize this so you can still clearly
07:24 - see it arithmetic operators and then we
07:31 - have relational operators and the third
07:33 - one will be logical operators the fourth
07:38 - one is assignment operators and fifth
07:47 - one will be increment increment and
07:52 - decrement operators I'm just going to
07:57 - list it here so you can see all the type
08:00 - of operators in our C programming
08:02 - language so decrement operators and then
08:06 - we also have the conditional conditional
08:11 - operator we also have bitwise operators
08:17 - and then we have special operators so
08:24 - these are all the types of operators
08:27 - that we can use inside our C programming
08:30 - language and of course the first one is
08:32 - arithmetic so arithmetic operators
08:35 - include it includes addition of course
08:41 - of course the symbol for that is the
08:43 - plus right and then we also have
08:46 - subtraction symbol for that is - we also
08:52 - have multiplication and we can use the
08:54 - asterisk for that to multiply two
08:56 - numbers you know inside our C program
08:58 - and then of course we do have the
09:01 - division which is the forward slash
09:04 - forward slash symbol and of course we
09:08 - have the modulo and we can use the
09:11 - percent sign to like operate by using
09:16 - modulus okay now let's talk about the
09:21 - operators or arithmetic operators so for
09:23 - example you know addition so we can also
09:30 - like in B equals a minus B okay and then
09:44 - we can like have a portion that we
09:49 - cannot read eclair it the B because we
09:52 - already declared it there so you can say
09:55 - it D equals a minus B and then we can
09:59 - see E and then a times B and of course
10:09 - we can have the division and we're going
10:14 - to have like use the float or we can use
10:19 - the double for that double F equals one
10:24 - or a divided by B okay so these are they
10:28 - are all arithmetic operators that we can
10:31 - use inside our C program so basically
10:34 - you can add you can subtract you can
10:38 - multiply and you can divide two numbers
10:43 - inside your C program so so for example
10:50 - we're going to test this okay so in the
10:57 - in the IKE was a - B okay so we can
11:04 - display the total number is percent D
11:08 - and then the difference difference of
11:15 - the two numbers the difference
11:22 - difference is of course we're going to
11:27 - use the different or the variable D for
11:32 - the difference and then we can use
11:35 - another one which is the product the
11:40 - product is percent D and the next one is
11:50 - the quotient
11:53 - okay the potion of two numbers is of
11:59 - course the variable F and then we can
12:03 - use the format specifier which is LF
12:08 - okay and then of course the variable F
12:12 - something like this so let's run our
12:16 - program okay and we can enter two
12:20 - variables here or two numbers which is
12:22 - for example five and three okay so the
12:28 - difference or the total number is the
12:33 - total number is eight the difference is
12:35 - two and we need to format this so we can
12:39 - see clearly so we can add percent or I
12:43 - mean backslash n for each line the
12:49 - difference the coefficient and of course
12:52 - we need to have the product the product
12:56 - is percent D and then of course the
13:01 - variable E okay so again run a program
13:05 - build and run and then five and
13:08 - and three so the total is 8 or 5 plus 3
13:13 - is 8 and then the difference is 5 minus
13:16 - 2 or 5 minus 3 is 2 and then the product
13:19 - is 15 5 5 times 3 is 15 and then the
13:24 - coefficient is 1
13:27 - okay so there's only number there's only
13:31 - one 3 and the value 5 ok so I think
13:35 - that's all there is to it guys for this
13:37 - video and if you want to learn more
13:40 - about C programming language so make
13:43 - sure to watch the next video so see you
