00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use images
00:05 - and icons with your Visual Basic Windows
00:08 - Form application so suppose I have a
00:10 - situation so that I have this login form
00:15 - and I want to set a nice looking picture
00:18 - which suits my login form uh in my
00:23 - project so how can I do that or I have a
00:26 - situation that I want to show uh I on
00:30 - this button so all this I will show you
00:33 - in this video so let's set a
00:37 - picture on uh this form first so go to
00:42 - the tool box and there is a tool called
00:44 - picture box in
00:47 - your Visual Basic toolbox you can resize
00:50 - it just drag and drop and resize and
00:53 - when you click this small arrow button
00:57 - you will be able to see the size mode
01:01 - and the dock in parent parent container
01:04 - and choose image so first of all we will
01:06 - choose our image and I will choose a
01:10 - image from local resource so I will just
01:12 - select this radio button and import an
01:16 - image and I will
01:19 - simply import a a image here and I will
01:23 - click okay so you can see uh image is
01:28 - set in your picture box but when I
01:32 - stretch uh my picture box you see that
01:35 - the image is not totally fitting to the
01:38 - picture box so how to fix it once again
01:42 - there are two ways you can go to this
01:44 - arrow button once again and you can
01:48 - choose the size mode from here so there
01:51 - are some size mode so for example there
01:55 - is auto size which makes a picture
01:58 - bigger or according to the size of the
02:01 - picture your picture box will be sized
02:04 - but if your picture is bigger and your
02:07 - picture box is smaller I will suggest
02:10 - you to use stretch image so that it the
02:14 - picture will be adjusted according to
02:17 - the picture box size oh okay or you can
02:21 - use uh this uh Zoom also
02:24 - to stretch your or stretch or uh size
02:30 - your image according to the picture box
02:31 - but the best is stretch image okay so
02:36 - now this is done now I will show you how
02:40 - to set an icon on this
02:44 - button so first of all uh let me show
02:48 - you how you can get icons and other
02:51 - things from Internet it's very easy and
02:53 - free so just go to your browser
02:57 - and uh say
03:02 - free icons okay and the first option
03:08 - that you will see here or there are some
03:12 - uh options available which provides free
03:15 - icon
03:16 - online but generally I go to a site
03:21 - called icon archive which is a large
03:27 - amount of Icon you can find here and I
03:30 - go inside it and I can I will find
03:34 - according to my need for example I need
03:38 - a okay icon so here you can
03:41 - find all the icon related to okay and
03:45 - the other thing is the size of the icon
03:49 - so my button
03:51 - is uh sized and I a little button and I
03:57 - want to uh I want to have a icon which
04:00 - is sized as my login button so I can
04:05 - choose my icon size from here so go to
04:10 - this size and for example generally a
04:13 - small button takes 16 by 16 PX or you
04:16 - can choose this 24 by 24 PX also and
04:21 - when you choose it it will give you
04:25 - bigger image option and then I will go
04:29 - to the first option PNG image and I will
04:32 - right click and save
04:34 - as and I will save my this image in my
04:40 - desired location once you have done that
04:43 - just select your uh login button and go
04:51 - to search for
04:55 - uh the image property here so select the
04:58 - button and go to to the image property
05:00 - this is image property and click the
05:03 - small button and now this is the same
05:06 - way we have imported the earlier image I
05:10 - will choose my okay icon image and click
05:14 - okay and you see here your icon is
05:17 - placed into the
05:18 - login button but you also see that it's
05:24 - placed uh in the middle and your login
05:27 - uh text is also in the middle
05:30 - so how you can resolve that so that icon
05:33 - will be uh on the left side and the
05:37 - login text will be on the right side so
05:40 - just choose
05:41 - the icon align property from here and
05:45 - you can choose the alignment of the icon
05:48 - so I choose the left
05:50 - middle and now your icon is on the left
05:54 - middle okay and once again I will go to
05:57 - the button properties
06:00 - and now I will go to the text align from
06:03 - here and I can choose the text alignment
06:06 - from here also so for example middle
06:10 - right okay and now you can resize your
06:14 - button and it will look good now so in
06:19 - this way you can change the property and
06:22 - you can set the icons on the buttons and
06:26 - you can set the image with your Visual
06:28 - Basic windows application I hope you
