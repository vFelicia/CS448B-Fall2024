00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS version on your VMware
00:08 - Workstation player so let's get started
00:11 - hopefully you already have VMware
00:13 - Workstation player and let's see first
00:16 - of all how we can download the ISO file
00:19 - for Ubuntu 18.04 and then we will
00:23 - install it so first of all open your
00:25 - favorite browser and the first link
00:26 - which will appear here will be from
00:28 - ubuntu.com so just click on that and
00:30 - once this website is open we want to
00:34 - download the desktop ISO file so we will
00:38 - just go here which says desktop and you
00:43 - will be able to see this green button
00:46 - here which says download Ubuntu so we
00:48 - are going to click on download Ubuntu
00:50 - option and you can see the latest
00:53 - version at the time of making this video
00:55 - is 18.04 LT s so we will click on
00:59 - download button and here this website
01:01 - will encourage you to donate for the
01:04 - development of Ubuntu if you don't want
01:07 - it you can just scroll everything to $0
01:11 - and then you can just press on the
01:15 - Downloads button so not now take me to
01:18 - the download and once you click on the
01:20 - Downloads button the download of this
01:23 - ISO file will start now this ISO file is
01:27 - around 1.8 gigabyte file so it will take
01:30 - some time to download so I have already
01:32 - downloaded it and I have already saved
01:35 - this ISO file on my computer but you
01:39 - need to download this so once this ISO
01:42 - file is downloaded it will look like
01:45 - this it says Ubuntu - 18.04 desktop AMD
01:51 - 64 dot iso so once you have this iso
01:54 - file we are ready to create or open to a
01:58 - virtual machine so just open your VMware
02:01 - Workstation player and here we are going
02:03 - to create a new virtual machine so just
02:05 - click on this option and here just
02:08 - choose the last option which says I will
02:10 - install the operating system later and
02:11 - then click Next
02:13 - and here we will choose a linux and in
02:15 - the version just select Ubuntu 64-bit so
02:19 - Linux and the version is open to 64-bit
02:23 - and then click Next and here you can
02:25 - give the name to your Ubuntu operating
02:27 - system so for example open to 64-bit
02:30 - 18.04 and this is the default location
02:33 - where your virtual machine a file will
02:36 - be created so if you don't have the good
02:37 - reason to change it just leave it as
02:40 - default and then click Next and here
02:43 - this is the disk capacities we need to
02:47 - specify the disk capacity and the
02:50 - minimum capacity it required is 20 GB
02:53 - but you can always increase it so for
02:56 - example I want for now 60 GB disk
02:59 - capacity so I will just choose 60 GB
03:01 - here and then you will see two options
03:05 - here store virtual disk as a single file
03:08 - split virtual disk into multiple files
03:11 - so I'm going to choose the second option
03:13 - which says split virtual disk into
03:15 - multiple files and then click Next and
03:18 - this will be the specification of your
03:21 - virtual machine which will be created so
03:23 - we are going to just click finish and
03:25 - once you click finish you will see here
03:28 - your virtual machine will be created but
03:32 - still we cannot play it we need to do
03:35 - some more changes here so just select
03:37 - this virtual machine which you have
03:39 - created and then click this option which
03:41 - says edit virtual machine settings and
03:43 - here in the hardware settings you will
03:46 - see the memory first of all so by
03:48 - default p.m. where locates a memory of 1
03:51 - GB to your machine we can change it by
03:53 - moving this scroll bar up or down so for
03:55 - now I need 4 GB of memory and then you
03:59 - can choose the processors option by
04:02 - default one core is allocated I want 4
04:05 - for example so I will choose this option
04:07 - which says 4 and this is the hard disk
04:11 - space we required I have chosen 60 GB
04:15 - and now I'm going to click on the next
04:17 - option which says cd/dvd SATA
04:19 - auto-detect and this step is important
04:22 - so just click on CB CD DVD and in the
04:26 - connection
04:26 - just to the option which says use ISO
04:29 - image file and then browse for the file
04:32 - where your ISO file is saved so wherever
04:36 - you have saved your ISO file just go to
04:39 - the location so I have saved my ISO file
04:41 - here so I'm going to go to this location
04:44 - and I will choose my ISO file and then
04:48 - click open and then click OK now let me
04:52 - minimize this window and now we are
04:55 - ready to start our virtual machine
04:58 - installation so just click on this what

05:27 - which in which you want to install
05:29 - ubuntu so I will choose English and then
05:31 - I will click on install ubuntu button
05:33 - and the next step is to choose the
05:36 - keyboard layout so whatever country
05:39 - keyboard layout you have you can choose
05:42 - it from here so for example I have the
05:44 - German keyboard layout so I'm going to
05:47 - choose the German keyboard layout here I
05:50 - will just click on German and I will
05:53 - just click on default German option and
05:55 - then continue now in this next step it
05:59 - asks us what apps would you like to

06:12 - installing Ubuntu and I will also check
06:15 - this option which says install
06:17 - third-party software for graphics and
06:19 - Wi-Fi hardware so just choose this
06:22 - option also and then click continue and
06:23 - in this next step it says this computer
06:26 - currently has no detected operating
06:29 - system obviously because we are
06:31 - installing it as a virtual machine would
06:34 - you like to do this which is erase disk
06:38 - and install Ubuntu
06:40 - just leave it as default it's not going
06:42 - to do anything it's not going to erase
06:44 - anything we are installing it on our
06:47 - virtual machine so just leave it as
06:49 - default and then click install now and
06:51 - once again click on continue now in the
06:54 - next window you will be asked to provide
06:56 - your location
06:58 - Berlin is fine for me I will click
07:00 - continue now here on the next window you
07:03 - will be asked to give your name for
07:06 - example I will provide the name whatever
07:08 - name I want to provide to my computer
07:10 - let's say code bind and then the
07:14 - computer name will be code bind -
07:16 - virtual machine you can even remove the
07:20 - virtual machine option from here
07:21 - whatever name you want to give to your
07:23 - computer you can right here just choose
07:26 - the password which you can remember so
07:28 - I'm going to just choose any password
07:31 - and this will be the password using
07:34 - which you will be logged in into your
07:37 - open to operating system so just
07:38 - remember it and then click continue and
07:41 - you will see the installation of a
07:43 - window will start and in this step you
07:46 - need to wait for some time for the
07:48 - installation to finish and once the
07:50 - Ubuntu installation is finished you will
07:52 - see this kind of message which says
07:54 - installation is complete you need to
07:57 - restart the computer in order to finish
07:59 - the installation so I'm going to click
08:01 - on restart now and now it says please
08:04 - remove the installation medium and
08:06 - reboots so at this step we need to just
08:09 - close our virtual machine so I'm going
08:11 - to just click on close and I will say
08:15 - power off and once this machine is
08:18 - powered off we will start the VMware
08:21 - Workstation player once again and once
08:24 - the VMware Workstation Player is started
08:27 - again I'm going to choose the virtual
08:28 - machine which I have created and I'm
08:31 - going to just click on play virtual
08:33 - machine once again and if you see this
08:35 - kind of black window don't worry just
08:37 - wait for some time and the login window
08:39 - will appear so now I can see this kind
08:42 - of Ubuntu login window where my username
08:45 - is there so I'm going to click on the
08:47 - username and here I will provide the
08:50 - password which I have given at the time
08:52 - of installation
08:53 - and then press enter and you can see our
08:56 - Ubuntu desktop is now visible now one
09:00 - problem which you can face after the
09:02 - installation of Ubuntu on your VMware is
09:05 - that when you try to maximize this
09:08 - window this desktop doesn't resize
09:11 - according to the size of your desktop so
09:16 - to solve it what we need to do here is
09:19 - we need to just click here on these nine
09:22 - dot icon and in here we need to search
09:26 - for terminal and once the terminal is
09:30 - open we need to give some commands here
09:33 - so first command we need to give here is
09:36 - sudo apt - get install open - VM - tools
09:46 - okay so just get this command which says
09:49 - sudo apt - get install open-vm-tools and
09:53 - then press ENTER and here provide your
09:55 - Ubuntu password which you have set at
09:58 - the time of installation and then press
10:00 - enter once again and then press Y and
10:04 - then press enter once again so once this
10:07 - command is finished we need to give one
10:09 - more command so just use the last
10:12 - command which is sudo apt - get install
10:16 - open - VM - tools and then add a - here
10:21 - and then write desktop here so just
10:24 - write desktop after this command which
10:27 - we have provided last time and then
10:29 - press ENTER once again and then press Y
10:33 - once again and once this command is
10:35 - finished you just need to restart your
10:39 - Ruben - operating system so you can just
10:42 - restart from here you can just click on
10:44 - this button and then just say restart so
10:48 - now my ubuntu has been restarted i'm
10:50 - going to provide my open - password once
10:52 - again so now you can see my ubuntu has
10:55 - been restarted and i have been logged in
10:58 - and now you can press the maximize
11:01 - button here and you will be able to see
11:03 - the resizing of your bun - desktop
11:05 - according to the size
11:07 - of your host machine so this is how you
11:10 - can download and install Ubuntu 18.04 on
11:13 - your VMware Workstation player I hope
