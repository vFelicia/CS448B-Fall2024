00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install and use NG rock
00:04 - on your Windows operating system
00:06 - so for those of you who don't know what
00:09 - is NG Rock NG rock is a tool that
00:12 - provides a secure tunneling to your
00:14 - local development environment or server
00:18 - so basically it allows you to expose
00:20 - your local server behind your local
00:24 - internet or firewall to the outside
00:28 - internet which makes it easier and
00:31 - accessible for testing or debugging
00:34 - so everything will make sense when I
00:38 - gave you a small demo of NG Rock so
00:41 - basically
00:43 - in simple words if you have a local
00:46 - server for example running locally on
00:49 - your Windows operating system and you
00:52 - want to expose it to internet how you
00:56 - can do it for testing and g-rock is a
01:00 - tool which allows you to do that
01:03 - so to install NG Rock just open your
01:06 - favorite browser and search for NG Rock
01:08 - and the first link which will appear
01:10 - here will be from NG Rock and you can
01:14 - see under pricing here that NG rock is
01:19 - not free for Enterprise uh related
01:24 - usage but for testing and debugging and
01:30 - for creating your private project on
01:33 - non-commercial project it's free to use
01:36 - so we are going to use this free uh
01:39 - version of NG Rock so let's move to the
01:41 - downloads page so I'm going to click on
01:43 - download link here and then I will
01:46 - select Windows here
01:49 - there are a few different ways using
01:51 - which you can install NG Rock first one
01:53 - is this chocolatey package manager then
01:57 - you can download the zip file for the NG
02:01 - Rock we are going to download the zip
02:03 - file here so I'm going to click on the
02:05 - download button here and you can see
02:09 - this ZIP file is downloaded so you can
02:11 - see this NG Rock zip file here so let me
02:14 - extract it by right clicking and then
02:17 - click on extract all
02:18 - and let me extract it to my C directory
02:23 - and I will just
02:25 - name my directory as NG Rock okay so in
02:28 - C directory I just want to create a NG
02:31 - Rock uh directory so let me just extract
02:34 - that
02:36 - and once this file is extracted I'm
02:39 - going to go to
02:40 - my C directory and NG Rock and this NG
02:43 - rock.exe file is there so I'm going to
02:46 - just click on this exe file
02:51 - and you can see this NG rock is working
02:55 - right now in order to make this NG Rock
02:59 - accessible from any uh where or from
03:03 - your command prompt I'm going to just
03:05 - copy this path and then I'm going to set
03:09 - this in the environment variables right
03:12 - so I'm going to just type NV here and
03:16 - you will see this result which says
03:18 - added the system environment variables
03:21 - click on that the system environment
03:23 - variable window click on environment
03:25 - variable here and then I'm going to uh
03:28 - go to the system variable and under
03:31 - system variable I can see this path
03:33 - click on edit here and then click on new
03:37 - and then paste this path here and then
03:40 - click on OK and then click on OK and
03:43 - then click on OK
03:44 - that means
03:46 - when I want to use NG rock using command
03:50 - line I can do that now so I'm going to
03:53 - open the command prompt now and then
03:55 - just write NG Rock here and then press
03:59 - enter and gives me this kind of output
04:03 - about the usage of NG Rock so everything
04:06 - is working fine
04:08 - now in order to use NG rock you need to
04:12 - add the authentication token so you can
04:15 - see this is the command for that so NG
04:18 - Rock config add authentication and then
04:20 - you need to provide the authentication
04:22 - and how will you get the authentication
04:25 - just use the sign up link here on the NG
04:29 - Rock website
04:30 - and then you just need to sign up with
04:34 - your name email and your password so
04:38 - just do that I already have an account
04:41 - so I'm going to just log into my account
04:44 - and once you are logged into your
04:46 - account under setup and installation
04:48 - when you will scroll down you will see
04:51 - uh this command which is NG Rock config
04:54 - add authentication and I'm going to just
04:57 - copy this command so just go to your NG
05:00 - Rock account copy this command and then
05:02 - in your command prompt just paste this
05:05 - so let me just paste this command here
05:09 - so the command is NG Rock config add
05:13 - authentication and then your token let
05:16 - me press enter here and once you press
05:18 - enter your authentication token is saved
05:22 - to the configuration file and the path
05:26 - of that configuration file you can see
05:28 - here okay so one NG Rock authentication
05:33 - token is provided and it's successful we
05:36 - can use NG Rock now right so let me just
05:42 - clear the terminal here
05:45 - now let's say I have an application
05:48 - which is a very basic node.js server
05:51 - which is running on Port 3000 it can be
05:54 - any server in any language and let's say
05:59 - it's running on localhost Port 3000 so
06:03 - let me open this URL in my browser and
06:05 - what it does is it just prints hello
06:07 - world but as you can see it's running on
06:10 - my localhost port 3000 so I can expose
06:15 - this port 3000 and then I can
06:20 - just use NG Rock to expose this to
06:24 - internet right and the command for this
06:27 - is simple ngrok HTTP and then the port
06:30 - right so just give NG Rock here and then
06:35 - HTTP and then Port is 3000 in our case
06:40 - right because our server is running on
06:44 - Port 3000 here
06:46 - so I want to expose the port 3000 which
06:49 - is for the server which is running on my
06:52 - Local Host let me press enter here and
06:55 - you will see that our localhost Port
06:58 - 3000 is forwarded to this URL so now
07:03 - when you just copy this URL and then
07:05 - open it on your browser
07:09 - you will see uh discount kind of
07:12 - interface first of all and then when you
07:14 - click on visit site you will see the
07:17 - same hello world but this time this
07:20 - hello world is forwarded to this uh URL
07:25 - and this URL you can share it with your
07:28 - friend or colleague and then he can test
07:31 - it or debug it using this URL right you
07:36 - can't give this localhost 3000 URL to uh
07:40 - your colleague who wants to run this
07:42 - application on his own computer because
07:45 - this is running locally but if you
07:48 - expose it using NG rock on internet then
07:53 - it will provide you the public URL and
07:58 - using that URL you can just share this
08:01 - URL and your colleague or friend can
08:03 - test it on his computer
08:06 - and then just
08:09 - debug it or use it for example and that
08:13 - is the main benefit of using NG Rock not
08:16 - only that NG Rock can also forward TCP
08:20 - or UDP uh protocols also right so right
08:24 - now we have forwarded our server on HTTP
08:27 - but if you are running something on TCP
08:30 - or UDP you can still use NG Rock for
08:35 - that purpose also
08:37 - so that's a very a useful tool which uh
08:42 - every developer should know how to use
08:44 - it that's why I shared it so I hope you
08:47 - learned something new this time and I
08:50 - hope you enjoyed this video and I will
08:52 - see you in the next video
