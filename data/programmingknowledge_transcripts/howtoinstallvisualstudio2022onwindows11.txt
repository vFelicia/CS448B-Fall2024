01:23 - visual studio

01:26 - you this warning which says do you want
01:28 - to allow this app to make changes on

02:11 - with many different type of
02:14 - offerings and products and you can use
02:17 - visual studio for developing different
02:19 - kind of
02:20 - technologies for example
02:22 - asp.net and web development or azure
02:26 - development python development node.js
02:28 - development
02:30 - you can also use visual studio for
02:32 - desktop and mobile development so you

02:39 - database tools using visual studio so
02:41 - you can decide which
02:44 - development you want to do
02:46 - using your visual studio and once you're
02:49 - done you can just check that checkbox so
02:52 - i want to use this visual studio for
02:54 - dotnet desktop development so i'm going
02:57 - to just check this checkbox
02:59 - if you want to choose multiple
03:02 - technologies you can choose them also so
03:05 - i can check multiple check boxes from
03:07 - here
03:08 - and also it's going to show you the
03:10 - total space requirement for
03:13 - installing all these uh packages right
03:16 - so when you uncheck some of these
03:19 - packages you will see that the total
03:22 - space is going to reduce little bit okay
03:26 - so for now i'm going to just check
03:27 - dotnet desktop development and then
03:29 - click on
03:30 - install button which is going to start
03:33 - the download of all the necessary
03:36 - packages for
03:38 - the package which i have chosen and then

03:42 - so at this point also you need to just
03:44 - wait for the download and the
03:46 - installation to complete so you can see
03:49 - both download and installation of
03:51 - packages are happening in parallel
03:54 - so
03:55 - just
03:56 - leave your desktop opened until this
03:59 - process is going on you can grab a
04:01 - coffee or tea whatever you like and just
04:04 - keep an eye on this process until it
04:06 - reaches to the 100 mark so once the
04:09 - installation is finished you will be
04:10 - able to see this kind of window and here
04:13 - you can see under installed you will be
04:15 - able to see whatever packages you have
04:18 - chosen are installed here right also
04:21 - under available you will be able to see

04:38 - can click on the launch button which is
04:40 - going to launch
04:42 - visual studio on your windows 11

04:51 - this login with your microsoft account
04:53 - window so i'm going to log in with my
04:56 - microsoft account

05:00 - log in with your microsoft account so i
05:02 - have provided my email i'm going to
05:04 - click on next and now i'm going to
05:06 - provide my password and now i'm going to

05:30 - and you can see all these options here
05:33 - clone a repository open a project or
05:36 - solution
05:37 - you also have open a local folder and

06:08 - here and then from here i'm going to
06:10 - select a new project
06:13 - and then it's going to just search for
06:16 - all the templates and i can see here all
06:19 - these options so i have the c-sharp
06:22 - console app visual basic console app and
06:24 - then i have these all the other apps
06:26 - which i can create in my
06:29 - visual studio ide
06:31 - so for now let me create a very simple
06:33 - console app so i'm going to select the

06:54 - going to leave it as default and then
06:55 - click on create and once my project is
06:58 - created
06:59 - i can see uh this kind of interface
07:02 - under solution explorer i will be able
07:04 - to see my project and then there is this
07:07 - one file which comes by default with the
07:10 - project which is called program.cs in my
07:12 - case because i'm developing a very
07:15 - simple console application
07:17 - and now
07:19 - you just need to build your program and
07:21 - run it
07:22 - you can simply click on this green run

07:34 - build your project and once the build is
07:37 - successful
07:38 - visual studio is going to run your
07:40 - project so now i can see that the build
07:43 - was successful and i can see the result
07:45 - hello world here in the terminal
07:48 - and that's what i wanted to see so
07:50 - everything is working fine on my visual
07:53 - studio ide and now i can use my visual
07:56 - studio ide for the c sharp related
07:59 - development
08:00 - you can also add any other programming
08:03 - language support for example c plus plus
08:05 - or node.js or other
08:07 - frameworks
