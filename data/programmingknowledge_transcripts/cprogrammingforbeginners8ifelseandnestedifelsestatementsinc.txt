00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:04 - if statement in C programming now in
00:07 - this video I'm going to show you how you
00:09 - can use IFL statement in C and how you
00:14 - even you can use nested IFL statement in
00:18 - C programming so in the last video I
00:22 - have given you an example that how you
00:25 - can check the age of the person whether
00:28 - it's greater than 18 or equal to 18 or
00:32 - it's uh less than 18 right now I'm going
00:35 - to take the same example to uh
00:38 - demonstrate if else statement so uh what
00:43 - I'm going to do is I'm going to delete
00:45 - this stuff and now for example we just
00:48 - want to
00:49 - check whether the age is greater than 18
00:56 - or it's not greater than 18 so we we
01:00 - want to print if the great age is
01:02 - greater than 18 then we want to print
01:04 - the ages greater than 18 otherwise we
01:08 - want to print that the age is not
01:11 - greater than 18 or age is less than 18
01:15 - right so how we can do this we can do
01:19 - this uh either you can write uh some
01:23 - condition that the age is uh for example
01:27 - if condition and something like like
01:30 - this from our last video but there is a
01:34 - condition called
01:36 - else which catches all the all the
01:41 - condition which is not true right so if
01:47 - AG is not greater than 18 then the
01:51 - program goes to this else condition and
01:55 - this else as the name suggest that it
01:59 - indic indicates every other condition
02:01 - which is not satisfied by or if
02:05 - condition so if the age is not greater
02:06 - than 18 then it goes here in the lse
02:10 - statement so else after this bracket and
02:13 - then your curly bracket so else doesn't
02:16 - take any condition because it doesn't
02:19 - need to uh check any condition because
02:22 - it's everything other than this if
02:26 - condition right so in here we want to
02:29 - just
02:30 - write that the age
02:33 - is not greater than not greater than 18
02:39 - right and I'm going to compile and run
02:41 - my program and this will give me the
02:45 - answer so please enter the age I will
02:48 - write for example age which is greater
02:51 - than 18 which is 21 and I will press
02:54 - enter and it says me the age is greater
02:57 - than 18 now I'm going to rerun the
02:59 - program and this time I'm going to give
03:03 - 15 Which is less than 18 right and I
03:07 - will just press enter and it says the
03:10 - age is not greater than 18 that
03:13 - means this condition is checked and if
03:16 - this condition is not true your program
03:20 - goes to this else condition or the else
03:25 - condition of this if statement and this
03:28 - line will be printed right so this is
03:31 - how you can use lse statement whatever
03:34 - which is not true in this condition or
03:38 - which is not satisfied by if condition
03:41 - will be cached by this else condition
03:45 - right now there are situations where you
03:49 - need to check multiple uh situations so
03:54 - for
03:55 - example you can uh just check
04:00 - multiple condition by if else statement
04:03 - so for example you want to check if the
04:05 - age is greater than 18 or if the age is
04:08 - equal to 18 then you want to print age
04:11 - is equal to 18 otherwise you want to
04:13 - print that age is not greater than or
04:17 - equal to 18 so you can just give
04:20 - the else here and then
04:25 - if and as the as the name suggests you
04:29 - you can check the second condition using
04:33 - this lsf statement right and it also
04:37 - takes uh this curly braces just provide
04:41 - these curly braces here and here this
04:45 - because if
04:47 - it we are taking if condition here so we
04:51 - need to check other condition for
04:54 - example age is equal to 18 age is
05:00 - equal to 18 we are checking whether the
05:02 - age is equal to 18 if the age is equal
05:05 - to 18 we can just print age
05:09 - is equal
05:13 - to equal to 18 otherwise we will PR
05:17 - print AG is not greater than 18 or AG is
05:21 - not greater than
05:28 - or
05:30 - equal to 18 so age is not greater than
05:33 - or equal to 18 right so we can check
05:38 - these conditions and this is called else
05:41 - if so we can check multiple conditions
05:45 - by using El if statement if else if and
05:50 - then otherwise if the condition is not
05:52 - true then this uh will be executed so
05:55 - what will be the program flow here the
05:59 - program program will ask the age first
06:01 - to the user and it goes here and if this
06:05 - age entered by the user is greater than
06:07 - 18 then this will be printed and every
06:11 - other uh you know if condition will be
06:14 - ignored and this will uh not be executed
06:17 - this code and this code will not be
06:19 - executed otherwise if the age is not
06:22 - greater than 18 then it will go to this
06:26 - uh condition checking El if condition
06:28 - checking and your age if the age is
06:33 - equal to 18 then this will be printed
06:36 - and everything other then this will be
06:40 - skipped
06:42 - and all the other code will not be
06:44 - executed right otherwise if the age is
06:48 - not equal to 18 and if the age is not
06:51 - greater than 18 this code will be
06:53 - executed and in the same way you can use
06:58 - multiple if else conditions like
07:01 - this okay so it's not
07:04 - restricted that you only need to use one
07:07 - if else statement or else if if
07:10 - statement you can use multiple you know
07:12 - condition and you can check multiple
07:14 - conditions using IFL
07:17 - statement now for example you want uh to
07:22 - check whether uh you know this age is
07:26 - greater than 18 but it's less than uh 21
07:30 - also how you can check it so if the age
07:34 - is greater than 18 we want to print this
07:38 - condition and inside this code we also
07:40 - want to check if the age is uh you know
07:44 - uh less than 21 so you can use nested if
07:48 - conditions like this so here inside your
07:52 - if condition which is this curly braces
07:56 - you can use if once again you can check
07:59 - the age is less
08:03 - than less than
08:06 - 21 you can
08:10 - print ages less than 21 okay so you can
08:15 - just print age is greater than 18
08:20 - but less
08:22 - than
08:24 - 21 okay and in the you know uh other
08:30 - case you can just write else here
08:34 - else and you can just provide other
08:38 - statement that if the age is greater
08:42 - than 18 but it's not less than 21 so but
08:48 - not less than 21 okay I will compile and
08:52 - run this program and this is called
08:54 - nested if else condition okay so because
08:57 - you are using
09:00 - if condition inside a if Condition it's
09:03 - called nested if else uh statements okay
09:07 - so it's not necessary that you cannot uh
09:10 - use if condition inside if condition you
09:13 - can use multiple if condition to check
09:16 - multiple conditions in C right run the
09:20 - program and for example I give the age
09:24 - 26 which is greater than 18 but it's not
09:28 - less than 21 so ideally we will see this
09:32 - message the age is greater than 18 but
09:34 - not less than 21 press enter and it says
09:38 - the age is greater than 18 which is this
09:41 - statement which is due to this statement
09:43 - the age is greater than 18 now it goes
09:46 - here and it sees that 26 is not less
09:49 - than 21 so it goes to the else condition
09:52 - and it will print this the age is
09:53 - greater than 18 but not less than 21 and
09:57 - it's printing it here the age age is
09:59 - greater than 18 but not less than
10:02 - 21
10:04 - otherwise I will rerun this this program
10:06 - and uh let's delete or not delete but
10:11 - let's provide this uh line break
10:15 - here so that this will be the change in
10:19 - the line and this time we provide 20 as
10:22 - the age and it says that the age is
10:25 - greater than 18 but the age is is also
10:29 - less than 21 right so in this way you
10:35 - can uh just check whether this age is uh
10:41 - you know multiple condition you can
10:43 - check it from here right so this is how
10:46 - you can use IFL statement and nested LL
10:50 - statement in C this is called nested if
10:53 - inside your IFL statement and this is
10:56 - called lse if statement and this is
10:58 - called
10:59 - else statement in if statements so I
11:03 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
