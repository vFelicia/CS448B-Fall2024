00:01 - [Music]
00:07 - hello guys welcome back to another
00:10 - tutorial hit the bill icon button so
00:12 - that you don't miss out any tutorial ok
00:17 - in this video we're going to start
00:19 - talking about exploratory data analysis
00:23 - in a lot more detail and specifically
00:26 - we're going to look at visualizing
00:29 - variation in single variables so recall
00:33 - in the in the introduction we talked
00:35 - about that there are really two main
00:36 - tools that we work with in exploratory
00:38 - analysis that those are data
00:40 - visualization and then transformation so
00:42 - for the first part here we'll talk all
00:45 - about data visualization and we'll break
00:48 - that down even to first looking at
00:52 - variation in single variables right so
00:55 - remember one of our questions is what's
00:57 - going on what's the behavior and the
01:00 - characteristics that exist in single
01:04 - variables and so we'll look at variation
01:06 - in single variables and we'll look at
01:08 - those in terms of data type as well will
01:11 - first look at discrete categorical
01:12 - variables in this video and in the next
01:15 - video we'll look at continuous variables
01:18 - so let's go ahead and load our Tidy
01:20 - verse package and we'll start by working
01:24 - on discrete categorical variables all
01:27 - right
01:27 - the data set we're gonna work with is
01:29 - called the Diamonds data set let's go
01:32 - ahead and just open this up and have a
01:34 - look at the Diamonds data set this will
01:36 - load automatically with with Tidy verse
01:39 - whenever you load Tidy verse so we have
01:42 - a data set that has 53 almost 54
01:46 - thousand rows so it's a very sizable
01:49 - data set and then you know we've got
01:52 - about eight one two three four five six
01:55 - seven eight about ten variables and so
01:58 - these tell us different things about
01:59 - about our diamonds
02:02 - so in this data set each row represents
02:03 - a diamond carats you're probably
02:07 - familiar with cut is a descriptive ideal
02:10 - premium good very good fair it's at
02:12 - it's a quality characteristic we have
02:15 - color labelings which are assigned a
02:18 - letter and then clarity also are
02:22 - designated each diamond is designated a
02:24 - code to represent its clarity and then
02:28 - there's depth and table which are
02:30 - dimensional characteristics of the
02:33 - diamond we have XY and Z which are
02:36 - dimensional measurements on the diamond
02:38 - and then we have the price of the
02:40 - diamond so just a number of different
02:43 - characteristics both both quantitative
02:46 - and descriptive or categorical as well
02:49 - as the price of our of our diamonds
02:52 - okay so that Orient's you to the data
02:54 - set so again for this video will focus
02:59 - on discrete categorical variables so
03:02 - we're gonna be focused on cut color and
03:05 - clarity okay cut color and clarity cut
03:10 - let's just jot those down here okay so
03:15 - these are our categorical variables and
03:18 - so one of the first things that we can
03:21 - do is just look at some summary
03:24 - statistics right so for categorical
03:28 - variables the summary statistics really
03:30 - are just counts we want to know how much
03:32 - of each category exists in in the data
03:36 - and so we can just kind of use the the
03:38 - piping syntax here to just filter down
03:43 - to two cut color and clarity and then we
03:48 - can use this summary function which is
03:50 - really handy and it'll work based on the
03:54 - data type so whenever we pass it a
03:57 - discrete variable or a categorical
03:58 - variable it automatically knows just to
04:01 - return accounts so we see that we filter
04:03 - down to cut color and clarity and then
04:06 - we get the various counts here for each
04:08 - one so for four cut it looks like we
04:10 - have five values remember our goal here
04:12 - is just to get a sense of what's going
04:14 - on with each of these categorical
04:16 - variables so for cut there are five
04:18 - different five different values fair
04:20 - good very good premium and ideal fair
04:24 - there's very few of only about sixty
04:26 - all the way up to over 21,000 of ideal
04:29 - cut so these are not evenly represented
04:32 - in the data set there's quite a few more
04:34 - as you go through the different cut
04:36 - categories color similarly has seven
04:41 - values D through J and so we got you
04:45 - know quite a range of values looks like
04:47 - the largest is just over 11,000 the
04:49 - smallest is down here at James about
04:50 - 2,800 and then they're just kind of
04:53 - mixed in in there it doesn't we can
04:55 - notice that a and F are similar in size
04:57 - 97 98 hundred and ninety five hundred
04:59 - and they clarity the clarity
05:02 - classifications also as seven note
05:04 - there's an other category that has 2500
05:06 - and then these are sorted actually in
05:09 - order so there's about 13,000 of the si1
05:12 - clarity code all the way down to the the
05:15 - 3600 for vvs1 and then 2500 just marked
05:20 - as other so it just kind of gives you a
05:22 - sense of what's going on so you can get
05:25 - your counts there but the the really the
05:28 - best way to digest these counts is to
05:31 - create a bar chart right so we'll go
05:33 - ahead and create a bar chart so let's
05:35 - call ggplot we'll go ahead and and put
05:37 - the data set in the GG plot line
05:43 - diamonds and so we're gonna call GOM bar
05:47 - and our mapping then we can just put
05:50 - each one of these into into the
05:55 - aesthetic so first we can look at cut
05:57 - and this will give us a bar chart of cut
06:00 - and so if we pop that out again what we
06:03 - saw earlier over here in the in the
06:05 - numeric tabular summary is reflected
06:08 - again in the bar chart which hopefully
06:11 - would be the case so fair you know
06:13 - there's a very small amount of fare
06:15 - compared to say ideal which which
06:18 - obviously kind of dominates the data set
06:20 - and then premium and very good are
06:23 - pretty close there within about a couple
06:25 - of thousand of each other here right so
06:28 - we see that the the vertical axis again
06:30 - is the count on a bar chart we discussed
06:32 - that in the visualization section so
06:35 - just you know kind of a nice a nice
06:37 - representation of the data nice
06:40 - err steps and I think the main takeaway
06:42 - here is that ideal the ideal category
06:46 - for cut is the predominant one and fair
06:48 - is relatively small and they just kind
06:50 - of stare step in between there we could
06:52 - also assume here and this is true if you
06:54 - look at the documentation that these are
06:56 - in order of kind of desirable miss so
06:59 - fare is kind of the lowest quality and
07:02 - then they go up to good and very good
07:04 - premium and then ideal obviously is sort
07:06 - of the perfect the perfect cut that
07:09 - you'd be looking for okay so we have a
07:11 - lot in terms of cut our data set has a
07:14 - lot of very good diamonds in it so
07:20 - that's something to keep in mind
07:21 - whenever we think about modeling
07:23 - particularly on price we might assume
07:26 - one one question and we won't
07:27 - investigate this right now but we might
07:29 - assume that an ideal cut diamond would
07:33 - be higher priced than a fair cut diamond
07:35 - so in other words something with a
07:37 - better cut would cost more than
07:39 - something with a with a worse cut so
07:41 - that's a probably reasonable assumption
07:42 - that we'd want to validate when we get
07:44 - to looking at variables together
07:46 - I might jot that down as a question does
07:49 - cut does price differ as we look at cut
07:52 - so that so be a perfectly good question
07:54 - when are we into modeling you'd want to
07:56 - think about that would it make sense to
07:58 - kind of bucket our diamonds buy cut if
08:01 - say we were one wanting to model price
08:03 - right so it's an example of how
08:06 - exploratory analysis just continues to
08:08 - generate more questions does this
08:10 - difference change price and certainly
08:13 - you've got more data points in the ideal
08:15 - category so if you took an average price
08:17 - or something over the data set it might
08:19 - be influenced by the cut so I've copied
08:22 - our ggplot call here that we use so that
08:25 - we can look at color and and we'll want
08:28 - to do clarity as well
08:29 - so here's color again the the G color
08:33 - kind of dominates but really you know e
08:36 - FG I would say even H are kind of in a
08:39 - similar grouping you know sort of around
08:41 - averaging around eight nine thousand and
08:44 - then and then the lesser columns are di
08:47 - and J and I'm not sure if there's any
08:51 - quality
08:53 - interpretation to be made here you know
08:56 - where we would say gee is a more
08:57 - desirable color than J or something like
08:59 - that I don't think that's the case but
09:02 - we do have some different counts here
09:03 - nothing too stark other than the fact
09:05 - that J is is fairly low and then we can
09:09 - do the same thing for clarity as well
09:10 - let's go ahead and put in a plot for
09:13 - clarity and we'll have a look at that
09:17 - and so we get kind of a nice another
09:20 - nice bar plot notice right off the bat
09:22 - that the Iwan is very very small
09:25 - really not not a lot of those similar
09:28 - for if' pretty small especially compared
09:32 - to these these two towers right in the
09:35 - middle which are which are quite tall
09:37 - okay so we see that kind of the S the S
09:39 - one in the V s to sort of dominate
09:42 - everything followed by s 1 2 and V s 1
09:46 - and then perhaps these two could be
09:49 - paired together and then the if' and and
09:50 - i1
09:51 - um so that's something I would take away
09:53 - from here is that there tend to tense it
09:56 - looks like maybe we could group these we
09:59 - could potentially group the clarity
10:01 - classifications into a smaller number so
10:04 - we've got 8 groupings right now but
10:06 - really again this the 2 on the end I won
10:08 - and I F might be a grouping where we
10:10 - could group those together vvs1 and vbs2
10:14 - could potentially be be grouped together
10:17 - just in terms of size vs 1 here and si 2
10:21 - potentially and then the two taller ones
10:24 - there just in terms of what they already
10:26 - bring to the group we could also group
10:29 - them by their their letter their first
10:32 - letter so you know I one could
10:34 - presumably be grouped with I f2 or
10:38 - excuse me i F the Vivi's could be
10:40 - grouped together the V's and the esses
10:42 - could could be grouped together just for
10:45 - for kind of some contextual background
10:48 - reasoning they probably represent the
10:50 - same thing okay so really when we're
10:53 - looking at discrete categorical
10:54 - variables again the main thing we're
10:56 - interested in is just the count how many
10:58 - of each group exists in the data set and
11:01 - we're looking for groups that are that
11:03 - are either over-represented or
11:05 - underrepresented
11:06 - in some way and so we we kind of have a
11:08 - sense of that now as we look at the
11:11 - plots for cut for color and for clarity
11:15 - we get a sense of which ones are the
11:17 - predominant groupings and which ones are
11:18 - the are the less are the less
11:21 - represented groupings for those
11:23 - variables so that'll do it for this
