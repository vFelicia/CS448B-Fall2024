00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to teach you about Arrow
00:06 - member selection operator so in the last
00:09 - video I have shown you how you can
00:12 - create a class in other files other than
00:17 - your
00:19 - main.cpp so we have created a class
00:23 - using this source file or CP file and
00:27 - header file so if you haven't seen that
00:30 - video just watch it so you know how you
00:33 - can create your file in the separate
00:37 - file or how you can create a class in a
00:40 - separate file other than your
00:42 - main.cpp so I'm going to use uh this
00:46 - class example which I have shown in the
00:48 - last video and I will demonstrate how
00:52 - this Arrow member selection operator
00:54 - works so in this
00:58 - header uh both book. header or book. uh
01:02 - file which I have made in the last video
01:06 - I have
01:07 - defined the class prototype and I have
01:11 - declared a book class and in this we
01:16 - have public
01:18 - members which is Public public member
01:21 - variable book ID and we have created
01:24 - getter and Setter of this book ID
01:28 - variable getter method and set a method
01:31 - of this book ID right so our header file
01:35 - contains the Prototype of a class and
01:39 - member functions and our source file
01:42 - will contain the source code of these
01:45 - prototype which are here and how it
01:49 - knows how your cpb file Knows by
01:52 - including this header file in your ctpv
01:55 - file it knows there is a class which
01:57 - exist in book. header
02:00 - and I
02:03 - have written the source for this uh set
02:07 - and get a method in this CPU file which
02:12 - is just uh setting the value and getting
02:15 - the value which you know U by now
02:19 - already I have already explained how to
02:21 - uh Define Setter and getter method in
02:23 - C++ in the earlier videos so this is
02:27 - what this class is doing it has one one
02:30 - member variable and one Setter function
02:34 - and one getter function for this member
02:36 - variable right
02:39 - and the definition or the source for
02:42 - these member functions for set a book ID
02:46 - and get book ID is here and this I
02:50 - explained you in the last video and I
02:52 - all I have already also explained you in
02:56 - the last video how you can create an
02:58 - object of the class for example book
03:01 - class and how you can call
03:04 - this member me method or member
03:07 - functions from the class using this this
03:10 - object okay so we have called set book
03:13 - ID and get book ID from the book
03:18 - class
03:20 - now you can also say that this book
03:24 - class is your user defined data type so
03:29 - we have seen we can
03:30 - create string for example string
03:35 - some
03:37 - value and this we call it as a data type
03:41 - and this we called it as a value right
03:44 - so we can also say that this book is our
03:49 - book data type right which we have
03:52 - created so it's a user defined data type
03:55 - and this is a variable in other words
03:58 - right and we can use the concept of
04:01 - pointer which I have explained you in
04:04 - the earlier videos and we can use the
04:08 - address of this object to access Our
04:11 - member functions from the class so how
04:13 - we can do it we can Define
04:18 - uh
04:21 - book books uh pointer for example so I
04:25 - will
04:26 - say uh first of all this estx and then
04:33 - book
04:35 - pointer and what this book pointer
04:39 - does or what is a pointer a pointer is a
04:44 - variable whose value is the address of
04:47 - another variable right if you remember
04:52 - so I want to give the value of this
04:55 - pointer as a address of this book class
04:58 - so I will write equal to
05:00 - and we give address by this end sign and
05:04 - address of book class so we have created
05:07 - a pointer of type book okay and by using
05:13 - this pointer we can access these set and
05:17 - get
05:19 - method like we have uh seen in the case
05:22 - of book one book one so when we created
05:25 - book one we can use dot separator to
05:29 - access these member variable but
05:31 - whenever you use
05:33 - pointer what you need to do either you
05:37 - can do it like this so you just copy
05:39 - this pointer of type book and give this
05:44 - bracket and paste this pointer inside
05:48 - this and then write dot your whatever
05:52 - member variable you want to call so I
05:55 - call it call set book ID and I set it
06:01 - 300 for example okay and I want to print
06:06 - this so once again I will just copy
06:11 - this whole pointer dot the get book ID
06:16 - or the member variable so I either you
06:19 - can use this kind of definition to call
06:23 - member variables and I compile this
06:26 - program and I will run this program
06:30 - so let's run it and it says 100 and 300
06:34 - so it's working fine our pointer of book
06:37 - type is working fine but there is a
06:40 - better way of doing this which we are
06:43 - doing it it looks a little bit weird or
06:47 - ugly uh when we see it so what we can do
06:51 - instead of uh doing the point in the
06:54 - brackets dot uh the member function
06:57 - instead of this I can just copy my
07:01 - pointer which is book pointer and I will
07:06 - give
07:07 - Arrow like this and this Arrow or this
07:12 - arrow is called the arrow member
07:15 - selection operator and the function of
07:18 - this is same as this dot separator
07:22 - but whenever you use Arrow your C++
07:27 - program knows that this is a pointer so
07:31 - whenever you use pointer you
07:34 - separate it or you can access your
07:37 - member variable by using these
07:41 - Arrow XIs or Arrow member selection
07:45 - operator right and I can do the same
07:49 - here so I will call this uh select or
07:53 - set book ID here and this time I will
07:55 - set book ID thousand for example and I
07:58 - will call
08:01 - this C out
08:03 - here and I can once again use this Arrow
08:07 - separator or Arrow member selection
08:11 - operator to call my get function also or
08:15 - get book ID also and this looks much
08:19 - better you need don't need to write this
08:23 - all even though this is also valid in
08:26 - this case but this looks much better and
08:29 - by seeing this Arrow separator you can
08:33 - say that this variable or this object is
08:38 - our pointer to pointer of this type or
08:42 - whatever type you define and this will
08:45 - work same as this code so let's try to
08:49 - compile the
08:51 - program and run the program and you see
08:54 - here we can see thousand this time so
08:58 - you can
09:00 - Define the pointer of a class and using
09:05 - this pointer of a class you can access
09:07 - the member variable of a class
09:11 - either like this or using this Arrow
09:15 - member selection operator okay so I hope
09:19 - you have learned uh this Arrow member
09:23 - selection operator very uh in a very
09:28 - good way and and I hope you have enjoyed
09:30 - this video please rate comment and
09:32 - subscribe and bye for now
