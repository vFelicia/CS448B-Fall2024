00:01 - hey guys in this video I am going to
00:03 - show you how you can install and use
00:05 - numpy with your Visual Studio code
00:08 - editor
00:09 - so let's get started and let's see how
00:11 - can we can do it
00:13 - so
00:14 - go to the folder where you want to
00:16 - create your numpy project so just open
00:19 - it in your folder Explorer let's say I
00:22 - want to create my numpy project here so
00:26 - I can right click here and then click on
00:28 - show more options and click on open with
00:31 - code which is going to open this folder
00:33 - in Visual Studio code editor you can see
00:35 - python apps
00:37 - now here you can create your numpy app
00:42 - for example I am going to name my file
00:45 - as
00:46 - num underscore test dot py file okay and
00:52 - it has created my python script
00:56 - here I'm going to add a very simple
00:58 - numpy code and save it
01:01 - now in order to ah
01:04 - install numpy in your Visual Studio code
01:07 - environment you can just click on
01:09 - Terminal and then open a new terminal
01:12 - here
01:13 - and once the terminal is open you can
01:16 - choose between Powershell or command
01:19 - prompt here so let me choose the command
01:22 - prompt option from here okay so you can
01:25 - see the command prompt is open so you
01:28 - can switch between terminals from this
01:31 - terminal window
01:33 - so I'm in the command prompt window and
01:37 - what I'm going to do here is I'm going
01:39 - to create a virtual environment for my
01:43 - project so to create a virtual
01:45 - environment I can just write python
01:48 - space hyphen M and then VN v e n v and
01:55 - the name of your environment I can name
01:58 - my environment as my
02:00 - n or something else the name depends on
02:04 - you so you can give any name to your
02:06 - environment just press enter here which
02:09 - is going to create this my and folder
02:14 - okay and you can see it says we noticed
02:18 - a new environment has been created do
02:20 - you want to
02:21 - select it for the workspace folder just
02:26 - click on yes here
02:28 - and once you click on yes Visual Studio
02:31 - code is going to recognize your virtual
02:34 - environment and then it's going to show
02:38 - you some options right now when you go
02:40 - inside this virtual and folder you can
02:43 - see few scripts here and there will be a
02:47 - script called activate
02:50 - so we want to uh use this activate file
02:55 - in order to activate our virtual
02:58 - environment so in order to do that you
03:02 - just need to write this command so just
03:05 - write whatever is the name of your
03:07 - virtual and folder in my case it's named
03:11 - my n and then give forward slash this is
03:16 - a forward slash and not a backslash
03:18 - right then write scripts forward slash
03:22 - activate you can also write forward
03:25 - slash activate dot bat file because you
03:29 - can see under script you have both this
03:31 - file activate and activate dot bat
03:34 - let's run this with without dot bat I'm
03:39 - going to press enter and your
03:43 - environment has been activated and how
03:46 - you know that your environment is
03:48 - activated you will be able to see this
03:51 - my n under these parentheses before
03:56 - this Command right so once you see your
04:01 - environment before this folder path that
04:04 - means your environment has been
04:06 - activated right now in this environment
04:10 - you can just install any package and
04:16 - this will be applicable only for your
04:20 - environment for this project okay so
04:24 - here
04:25 - you can just type pip
04:28 - install numpy
04:30 - and then press enter which is going to
04:33 - start installing numpy package
04:35 - in your virtual environment for your
04:38 - project
04:39 - so you can see it says installing
04:41 - collected package and once a numpy is
04:44 - installed you can see this message which
04:47 - says successfully installed numpy and
04:50 - the version of numpy you might see some
04:53 - warnings here you can see you are using
04:56 - Pip this version and the newest version
04:59 - is this one so just try running this
05:03 - command you can do that there is no harm
05:06 - in doing this so
05:09 - if you want you can run this command so
05:12 - you just need to run this command in
05:14 - order to upgrade your pip package
05:18 - manager so you can just write pip
05:21 - install then upgrade before that you
05:26 - just need to write hyphen hyphen
05:29 - upgrade pip okay and then press enter
05:33 - and it's going to upgrade the PIP okay
05:35 - so let me just run this numpy script we
05:40 - have created a virtual environment we
05:42 - have installed numpy package so the only
05:45 - thing which remains is the running of
05:48 - this file so you can run this file by
05:52 - just using the python command so just
05:54 - write Python and then the name of the
05:57 - file which is num underscore test.py and
05:59 - then press enter and it will show you
06:02 - this result if it shows the result of
06:06 - your code that means numpy is installed
06:10 - in your Visual Studio code with virtual
06:13 - environment and it's running fine right
06:17 - you can also install the extension which
06:21 - is called code
06:23 - Runner so just click on extensions and
06:27 - then search for code Runner which is a
06:30 - very popular
06:31 - extension for running various kind of
06:33 - codes so just click on install option
06:37 - here I have already installed this
06:39 - extension that's why it shows me
06:42 - uninstall but in your case you will see
06:44 - install option so just click on install
06:46 - and you will see disable or uninstall
06:48 - option once that is installed
06:51 - you will be able to see this run button
06:55 - on top right corner so
06:58 - the code Runner adds this button on type
07:03 - top right corner so just click on run
07:05 - button and it's going to run your code
07:09 - now when you run your python script with
07:14 - this code Runner
07:16 - you can see this error which says no
07:20 - module name numpy is found to solve this
07:24 - problem you can just add this line at
07:27 - the top of your code so let me show you
07:30 - uh this line which you can add at the
07:34 - top so just write hash and then this
07:38 - bank and then go inside your virtual end
07:41 - folder then go inside your script folder
07:45 - and then click on python.exe file right
07:49 - click and copy the path so just copy the
07:52 - path here and then just paste it after
07:56 - this hash bang okay so hash bang and
08:00 - then space and the path of your python
08:03 - exe in your virtual end save your code
08:07 - and run this code once again and this
08:09 - time your code will run okay so this is
08:12 - how you can install
08:14 - numpy on Visual Studio code to work with
08:18 - numpy inside your Visual Studio code I
08:21 - hope you enjoyed this video and I will
08:23 - see you in the next video
