00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can set up the Eclipse IDE
00:04 - for C and C plus development so this
00:07 - video is for those people who have
00:09 - already installed Eclipse IDE but they
00:12 - haven't selected C and C plus plus
00:13 - development at the time of installation
00:16 - of Eclipse IDE but now they want to use
00:20 - Eclipse IDE for C and C plus plus
00:23 - development so you can see here I have
00:25 - installed this Eclipse IDE for Java
00:29 - development and now I want to add the C
00:32 - and C plus Support also here I can see
00:35 - that when I create a new project so when
00:37 - I click on new and then click on Project
00:40 - I don't see any C and C plus plus uh
00:44 - project here right so let's see how we
00:48 - can add the CNC plus support so just
00:51 - open your Eclipse IDE and then click on
00:53 - help here and then click on install new
00:56 - software
00:58 - and once install new software window
01:00 - opens from the top just select all
01:03 - available sides here
01:06 - so once you select all available sites
01:09 - it's going to show you all the available
01:11 - sites now in some time you will be able
01:14 - to see this kind of list here
01:16 - so in this list you need to scroll down
01:19 - where it says programming languages so
01:22 - just select this option which says
01:24 - programming languages and expand this
01:27 - and then you will be able to see all
01:30 - these C and C plus plus tools also you
01:32 - will be able to see other programming
01:34 - languages and their support
01:37 - now under C and C plus plus you will
01:40 - also see uh all these options here right
01:43 - so I'm going to uncheck this uh check
01:46 - box here and check only those tools
01:50 - which I require
01:51 - so you can see uh there is a Serial C
01:55 - plus plus Auto tool support is here
01:57 - Docker container tool is here and then
02:00 - it has unit testing support and other
02:03 - CNC plus support for now I just want to
02:06 - use Eclipse IDE for C and C plus plus
02:09 - development like simple programming
02:12 - development so for that I can just
02:15 - choose these two options first one is C
02:17 - and C plus plus development tools and
02:19 - the other one is CNC plus plus
02:21 - development tool SDK SDK stands for
02:25 - software development kit so it is
02:27 - required in order to just develop C and
02:30 - C plus plus on Eclipse once you have
02:33 - selected both these check boxes just
02:36 - click on next here
02:38 - which is going to calculate the
02:40 - requirements and dependencies
02:44 - and then it's going to show you these
02:46 - options so we have selected both these
02:48 - options
02:49 - the C development tool will come with
02:52 - the GDB support development platform GA
02:56 - jnu toolkit build support and then you
03:00 - have the SDK it will come with
03:02 - development tools and then CNC plus plus
03:06 - development tool developer resources so
03:09 - I'm going to click on next here
03:11 - and then we need to accept license terms
03:14 - and conditions so just select this
03:16 - toggle button here and then click on
03:18 - finish
03:19 - which is going to download these tools
03:22 - so you can see the progress bar here and
03:25 - you can also see the installation
03:28 - percentage so you can see installing
03:30 - software and right now at this
03:33 - percentage is 49 so I'm going to wait
03:36 - for the download and once all the
03:38 - packages are installed it's going to
03:41 - show you this kind of message which says
03:43 - restart Eclipse IDE to support the
03:46 - software update so you just need to
03:48 - click on restart Now button which is
03:50 - going to restart your Eclipse IDE and
03:53 - you can see my Eclipse IDE has been
03:55 - started and after the installation of
03:57 - all the CNC plus plus packages Eclipse
04:01 - IDE is going to just set up all these
04:04 - CNC plus support packages and once
04:06 - that's done I'm going to click on this
04:08 - option here which says restore this
04:11 - small option here and it's going to
04:13 - restore your window here and now once uh
04:18 - you can see this kind of interface on
04:20 - Eclipse IDE you can click on create a
04:23 - new project from here or you can click
04:26 - on file and then click on new and then
04:28 - click on Project
04:29 - and now you can see the support for C
04:32 - and C plus plus also so just expand this
04:35 - option and then I'm going to create a C
04:38 - plus plus project for now so I'm going
04:40 - to select C plus plus here and then
04:42 - click on next here
04:44 - and now I'm going to just select this
04:48 - one it says hello world C plus plus
04:50 - project
04:52 - and you can see my uh Min GW tool chain
04:55 - is recognized here if you don't see Min
04:59 - gw's GCC compiler tool chain here you
05:03 - might need to install Min GW separately
05:06 - on your windows 11 operating system
05:09 - so I have already created a video in
05:12 - which I have shown how you can install
05:14 - Min GW on your Eclipse IDE
05:17 - so watch that video and then you can
05:20 - easily install Min GW on your windows 11
05:23 - operating system
05:25 - but if you already see this Min gwgcc
05:28 - compiler here you don't need to do
05:30 - anything
05:31 - and then you just need to give the name
05:33 - to your project I'm going to name my
05:34 - project as hello world here and then I'm
05:38 - going to click on next button here I can
05:41 - provide the name of the author
05:45 - I will just give a very simple name here
05:48 - CB and then click on next and just leave
05:52 - everything as default here and then
05:54 - click on finish which is going to create
05:56 - my C plus plus program
06:01 - and you can see uh for the first time
06:03 - when you create a c or C plus plus
06:05 - program it's going to show you this
06:07 - window which says open the C and C plus
06:09 - plus perspective I'm going to click on
06:12 - open perspective
06:13 - and once you do that it's going to open
06:16 - the CNC plus perspective here right
06:20 - so now you can see that our project is
06:25 - created and because we have chosen hello
06:28 - world program in C plus plus you can see
06:31 - our sample C plus plus program is also
06:34 - here under Source under Source folder we
06:36 - have hello world.cpv file and this is
06:40 - the code inside the CPP file now how you
06:43 - can compile or build your program and
06:45 - run it
06:46 - so you can see at the top all these
06:49 - options right these icons here so you
06:52 - can see this option build debug for the
06:55 - project and you can also see the Run
06:58 - button here so in order to build your
07:01 - project you can click on this option or
07:04 - you can click on project and then click
07:06 - on build all option here or you can
07:09 - click build project if you want to build
07:12 - the project right so I'm going to click
07:14 - on the build project option here which
07:17 - is going to build my project and you
07:19 - will see the output here of the build
07:21 - and you can see build finished
07:24 - successfully zero errors zero warning
07:26 - and in order to run this program you can
07:29 - click on this run option and then click
07:31 - on run as local CNC Plus application
07:34 - which is going to run your program and
07:37 - show you the output here right so you
07:40 - can see hello world is printed here you
07:42 - can also click on this run hello
07:45 - world.exe file which is also going to
07:47 - run your exe file and show you the
07:50 - result here you can now change your code
07:54 - for example and then click on run so
07:57 - when you click on run it's going to ask
07:59 - you if you want to build your program
08:01 - also right so just select your CPP file
08:05 - click on OK
08:06 - and it's going to build your C plus plus
08:09 - file and then show you the result right
08:11 - so it's going to compile your C plus
08:14 - plus program and then it's going to run
08:15 - your C plus plus program
08:17 - so this is how you can add the support
08:19 - for C and C plus plus in your Eclipse
08:21 - IDE I hope you've enjoyed this video and
08:23 - I will see you in the next video
