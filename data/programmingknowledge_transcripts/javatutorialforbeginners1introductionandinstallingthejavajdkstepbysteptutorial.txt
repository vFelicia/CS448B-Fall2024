00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - what is Java why do we care about
00:10 - learning Java and if time permits we
00:13 - will also see how we can install Java in
00:17 - our Windows operating system so what is
00:21 - Java Java is a highlevel programming
00:24 - language which was developed by Sun
00:28 - microsystem in early
00:31 - 90s so as any other high level
00:35 - programming language like cop or C++
00:38 - Java is also a high level language but
00:42 - it's a little bit different from other
00:45 - languages in a sense that it's a
00:48 - crossplatform
00:50 - uh programming language which you can
00:54 - develop and run on multiple operating
00:57 - system like Windows Linux and uh Mac OS
01:00 - or any other operating system and it
01:04 - runs its program using a special uh
01:09 - virtual machine called Java virtual
01:12 - machine which is this one so this Java
01:16 - machine is responsible for running Java
01:20 - programs and whenever you install Java
01:23 - on your operating system like Windows or
01:26 - Linux you also install this Java version
01:29 - virtual machine and this ja Java virtual
01:32 - machine is uh same for every you know
01:36 - operating system so your program runs on
01:40 - this Java virtual machine and not on the
01:43 - native uh you know windows or Linux
01:46 - operating system so this Java virtual
01:49 - machine is same for every operating
01:51 - system that's why it's it it runs on
01:55 - every uh operating system which Java
01:59 - supports right so if you compile a Java
02:02 - program on Windows you can run it on
02:05 - Linux or Mac OS using this Java virtual
02:09 - machine that's why before developing
02:13 - Java we need to install Java jdk and JRE
02:17 - on
02:18 - our operating system okay and Java is a
02:25 - objectoriented programming language so
02:28 - we will see what what objectoriented
02:30 - programming is and what are the features
02:33 - of object objectoriented programming but
02:37 - yeah it's objectoriented programming and
02:39 - with when we I will teach you uh more
02:41 - about uh the programming we will see
02:44 - what is uh
02:46 - this so now first of all we need to
02:51 - install Java on our system and
02:56 - uh it may be possible that Java is
02:59 - already in installed on your system or
03:01 - it may be possible that you have never
03:03 - installed Java on your system so how to
03:06 - check whether Java is install on your
03:08 - system it's easy so you just need to uh
03:13 - if you are on Windows 8 you just need to
03:15 - right click your uh start menu button
03:18 - and open command prompt from here and in
03:21 - here you just need to uh give this
03:23 - command Java C okay so give this command
03:27 - Java C and press enter
03:30 - and if this command responds that Java C
03:33 - is not recognized as an internal or
03:36 - external command then Java is most
03:39 - probably not installed in your system
03:42 - and you need to install Java on your
03:44 - system okay so like my operating system
03:47 - I don't have Java so I will install it
03:50 - so just open your browser and just uh
03:54 - search for Java
03:56 - jdk or simply Java also works and in
04:01 - here the first site will open hopefully
04:04 - from oracle.com just click this
04:08 - link and in here you will be able to see
04:13 - uh two options one is uh Java jdk other
04:18 - is net beans with jdk so Java is uh you
04:22 - know uh the platform and net beans is a
04:27 - IDE and you have the option to install
04:30 - Java with this uh development IDE but I
04:34 - will not uh choose this option but I
04:36 - will choose this option for now and at
04:39 - the time of making this video Java 8 is
04:42 - the latest version because um yeah it's
04:46 - the latest version right and when you
04:49 - click this Java uh button here so once
04:53 - again Java button I clicked in here you
04:56 - need to uh accept this license and
05:01 - condition in order to download uh this
05:04 - Java so just click this small radio
05:07 - button which calls accept license
05:10 - agreement and then choose your operating
05:13 - system so my operating system is Windows
05:18 - 64 if you have Windows 32-bit operating
05:22 - system you need to choose x86 but right
05:25 - now I have x864 operating system which
05:28 - is 64bit operating system that you can
05:31 - check if you are on Windows 8 you just
05:34 - need to go to systems so search for
05:37 - systems not like this but systems system
05:42 - and in here I can see that my system
05:44 - type is 64bit operating system so if
05:47 - it's 60 32-bit operating system you need
05:51 - to download 32bit uh executable file so
05:55 - mine is 64-bit so I will just click the
05:58 - 64-bit link and I will save this so it
06:02 - will take some time to uh download this
06:05 - uh Java uh executable so uh once this
06:09 - will be downloaded we will uh be ready
06:12 - to execute this executable and install
06:16 - Java so my download is complete now so I
06:19 - will run this executable
06:22 - file and I will minimize all the other
06:25 - things and this installation is really
06:29 - straight forward so you just need to
06:30 - click next and it will check the status
06:33 - and all
06:35 - and uh then it will start installing
06:38 - Java on your system and it's really
06:41 - straightforward so you don't need to
06:43 - worry about anything while you are
06:46 - installing
06:49 - Java and while installing it will ask
06:51 - you the destination folder whereever you
06:54 - want to install Java on your system and
06:57 - JRE on your system JRE stand for Java
07:00 - runtime en environment and jdk stands
07:04 - for Java development kit so these are
07:07 - two things which will be installed by
07:09 - this installer so I will generally leave
07:12 - them as default and I will click
07:15 - next and then wait for the installation
07:18 - to
07:22 - complete so now Java is successfully
07:24 - installed in our system uh you will be
07:27 - able to see this message and then I will
07:29 - close this and once you install Java you
07:33 - can check it while going to the C folder
07:37 - of your computer and then go to program
07:40 - files and in here you will be able to
07:42 - see uh this Java folder and in here you
07:45 - will be able to see two folders one is
07:48 - jdk folder and the other is uh JRE
07:52 - folder okay so jdk I already told you
07:56 - it's uh Java development kit and JRE is
07:59 - uh Java runtime en environment right so
08:02 - I will change the name of these jdk and
08:04 - J to uh you know make them short and
08:09 - really easy to you know understand so I
08:12 - will rename my jdk folder as
08:16 - jdk8 okay so it's just
08:20 - jdk8 and I will rename my JRE folder as
08:25 - jre8 because uh the version of uh this
08:29 - Java is java8 okay
08:33 - and here I can uh just make them uh view
08:38 - as large icon so you can see or extra
08:42 - large so you can see that I have named
08:46 - this as J jdk8 and j8 folders right so
08:52 - once you have done that you need to set
08:56 - your environment variable so that when
08:59 - whenever you run uh your uh Java program
09:03 - it will recognize these JD and JRE uh
09:06 - and then you will be able to compile
09:08 - your programs right so for that for uh
09:12 - setting your environment variable what
09:14 - you need to do is you just need to go to
09:17 - uh your systems so go to search and
09:20 - search for system once again if you're
09:22 - on Windows uh 7 or uh Windows XP you
09:27 - also need to search uh
09:29 - for system in control panel and then go
09:34 - to advanced settings and in here go to
09:37 - environment variables okay and in in
09:41 - environment variable in system variable
09:44 - here you will be able to find a variable
09:47 - called path you just need to click or
09:50 - double click this path or addit or click
09:54 - this addit button and in here you will
09:56 - be able to see variable name is equal to
09:59 - path and the variable values there will
10:04 - be already some values in here and you
10:07 - need to add some more value here which
10:12 - is the jdk so go to uh once again
10:17 - program file and Java folder wherever
10:19 - you have installed it and then go to
10:22 - jdk8 which is the folder we renamed and
10:25 - in here inside this jdk8 go to bin
10:28 - folder and this destination which is C
10:32 - program file Java / jdk8 /bin you just
10:36 - need to copy this path from here and
10:40 - then in your variable value just give a
10:45 - semicolon and paste your path which is
10:48 - uh the same path you have copied from
10:50 - here right once again go to uh your Java
10:55 - folder once again and then this time go
10:58 - to Jr
10:59 - okay and in here also you will be able
11:02 - to find a binary folder or bin folder
11:05 - and then copy the path from here and
11:08 - then give semicolon to your variable
11:11 - value whatever value is present already
11:14 - here and paste this path also okay so
11:17 - you need to give uh this uh C program
11:20 - file SL Java j8/ pin folder and C
11:26 - program file SL Java SL jdk8 /bin folder
11:31 - path here in environment variable and
11:34 - why do we set environment variable is uh
11:37 - whenever you compile a program whenever
11:41 - you compile a program uh if you set
11:44 - environment variable your compiler knows
11:47 - the path of these binary files which are
11:49 - responsible for compiling your program
11:52 - and it will be straightforward to
11:54 - compile your program now once you have
11:57 - done set your en environment variable we
12:00 - will open once again command prompt and
12:03 - check whether Java is really installed
12:05 - in our system or not so once again give
12:08 - Java C and press enter and this time I
12:12 - can see a big uh you know response in uh
12:17 - response to my Java C command and I can
12:20 - see uh that it's saying that the uses of
12:24 - this Java C is you need to give some
12:26 - options and source file so Java C is a
12:30 - command to compile a program or Java
12:33 - program so whenever you give a Java C
12:36 - Dash some Hello world. Java file it will
12:40 - compile your Java program and then uh
12:43 - you can run your Java program right
12:46 - that's why uh we use this Java C command
12:50 - so in this way you can install Java on
12:52 - your system now in the next video I'm
12:55 - going to show you how you can install uh
12:58 - an app IDE which is called Eclipse IDE
13:01 - which is widely used to develop Java
13:03 - programs so stay tuned and please wait
13:06 - comment and subscribe and bye for
13:08 - now
