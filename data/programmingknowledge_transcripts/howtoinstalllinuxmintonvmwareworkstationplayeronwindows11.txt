00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Linux Mint on your VMware Workstation
00:06 - player on your Windows operating system
00:09 - so let's start with the download of ISO
00:12 - file for the Linux Mint so just go to
00:15 - your favorite browser and search for
00:17 - Linux Mint and the first link which will
00:20 - appear here will be from linuxmint.com
00:22 - so we are going to click on this link
00:24 - and straight away you will see this
00:27 - download button here also you can see
00:29 - the download link at the top so here you
00:32 - can hover over the download and then
00:34 - click on the latest version so we are
00:38 - going to click on this download button
00:40 - here so once you are on the download
00:42 - page you have three variants of Linux
00:46 - Mint you can download
00:48 - one is the cinnamon Edition which looks
00:50 - like this other is the mate Edition
00:54 - which looks like this and then third one
00:58 - is the xfce Edition which looks like
01:01 - this we are going to download and
01:04 - install the cinnamon Edition so just
01:08 - click on this button which says download
01:10 - under cinnamon Edition and then when you
01:13 - scroll down a little you will see the
01:16 - download mirrors so the first one here
01:19 - is the world mirror I will recommend you
01:22 - to choose the mirror which is near to
01:27 - your location so if you live in USA just
01:30 - choose from one of these options so I'm
01:34 - going to choose the first option which
01:38 - is the world option for Simplicity but I
01:42 - will recommend you to download the ISO
01:45 - file from the nearest location from your
01:49 - location so you can see it's around 2.8
01:52 - GB file so it will take some time to
01:54 - download
01:55 - once this file is downloaded I have
01:57 - already downloaded this file so let me
01:59 - cancel this so once the file is
02:02 - downloaded it's going to look like this
02:04 - Linux Mint and then the version then
02:07 - cinnamon hyphen 64 bit dot ISO file now
02:11 - once you have the Linux Mint ISO file we
02:15 - are ready to install Linux Mint on
02:18 - VMware Workstation player so just open
02:20 - your VMware Workstation player and here
02:23 - you will see this link it says create a
02:27 - new virtual machine so just click on it
02:28 - so on this first window you have this
02:31 - welcome to the new virtual machine
02:34 - wizard just choose the last option here
02:37 - which says I will install the operating
02:39 - system later and then click on next
02:43 - now in the guest operating systems
02:46 - section because we want to install Linux
02:48 - Mint we will choose the Linux here as
02:51 - operating system and the version here is
02:54 - Ubuntu 64-bit by default but when you
02:58 - expand this list here you can search
03:02 - here that Linux Mint is not listed in
03:06 - this list right so you can see other
03:11 - Linux operating systems are here but
03:14 - Linux Mint is not listed so what you
03:17 - need to do here is you can choose the
03:20 - nearest uh operating system which is
03:24 - nearest to the Linux Mint which is
03:27 - Ubuntu 64-bit so just select 64-bit
03:31 - Ubuntu here and then click on next
03:34 - and then just give the name to your
03:37 - Linux Mint a virtual machine I'm going
03:40 - to name it as
03:42 - Linux Mint here
03:45 - and then I will leave 64-bit
03:48 - and it will be saved at this location so
03:51 - if you want to change this location just
03:54 - uh
03:55 - click on browse and then you can change
03:58 - the location of this virtual machine so
04:01 - for example on my PC I want to just save
04:05 - this virtual machine in a folder called
04:07 - Linux Mint so I will just choose that
04:10 - but if you leave this as default it will
04:13 - just take the default location so you
04:16 - don't need to worry about that right I'm
04:18 - going to click on next here
04:20 - now here you need to provide the disk
04:23 - capacity
04:24 - so it depends on the space which is
04:29 - available on your
04:32 - host operating machine in my case it's
04:35 - Windows 11 and by default it's 20 GB
04:38 - which is allocated I want to change it
04:41 - to 100 which will be the maximum disk
04:44 - size right and choose this option here
04:47 - which says split virtual disk into
04:50 - multiple files okay and then click on
04:53 - next
04:54 - and then you have the option to
04:56 - customize your Hardware here so you can
04:59 - see all the options which you have
05:01 - selected and then click on customize
05:04 - Hardware option and from here we can
05:07 - also customize our Hardware so now just
05:10 - select the memory section here
05:12 - by default you can see 4096 MB is
05:16 - allocated which is around 4 GB of memory
05:18 - which is recommended but depending on
05:22 - the memory which is available on your
05:24 - host operating system you can increase
05:26 - or decrease it so I will recommend it to
05:30 - just leave it as this green Mark but it
05:33 - depends uh you can also increase it so
05:36 - in my case I will just increase it up to
05:38 - 8 GB
05:40 - and then I'm going to click on
05:41 - processors here by default there are two
05:44 - processors I'm going to just uh choose
05:47 - four processor so here you can see
05:49 - virtualization engine virtualize Intel
05:52 - VT uh hyphen X EPT and then CPU
05:57 - performance counter and other option for
05:59 - now I'm going to leave it as unchecked
06:03 - and then I'm going to click on the next
06:04 - option and this option is for the new CD
06:09 - DVD SATA
06:11 - so here what we can do is we can just
06:15 - select this option which says use ISO
06:17 - file and then browse for your Linux Mint
06:20 - ISO file so you can see I have saved
06:23 - this ISO file in this folder so just
06:27 - browse to the location where your ISO
06:29 - file is saved and then select that ISO
06:32 - file and then click on open
06:35 - and you can see our Linux Mint ISO file
06:38 - is set here once that's done you can
06:42 - leave every other thing as default so
06:45 - you have this network adapter and an USB
06:48 - controller and other options but we
06:51 - don't want to change any of these
06:53 - options for now so just click on close
06:56 - and then click on finish which is going
06:59 - to create your virtual machine so you
07:02 - can see this Linux Mint 64-bit virtual
07:05 - machine has been created so now we just
07:08 - need to start our virtual machine which
07:10 - will start the installation of Linux
07:13 - Mint on VMware Workstation player so
07:16 - just wait for few seconds until this
07:19 - starts
07:20 - and here you can see software update so
07:23 - whenever you will try to install any uh
07:27 - Linux operating system on VMware

07:33 - it for the first time VMware Workstation
07:36 - player is going to recommend you this
07:39 - software update which is the following
07:42 - software is available for download which
07:44 - is VMware tools for Linux
07:47 - so this VMware tools for Linux will help
07:50 - you to use your Linux operating system
07:54 - which is your virtual machine in a
07:57 - better way so you can just click on
08:00 - download and install option which is
08:02 - going to start the download and install
08:03 - of this VMware tools for Linux so here
08:08 - you can wait for the download and
08:10 - install of this tool

08:31 - just choose the first option here and
08:34 - then press enter and once you press
08:36 - enter you will see that it's going to
08:38 - start the Linux Mint so just wait for
08:40 - few seconds and now you can see that
08:43 - Linux Mint has been started so at this
08:45 - point you can
08:48 - test Linux Mint how it feel and look
08:51 - like but the installation is not yet
08:54 - started right so this is just for you to

09:03 - like but if you want to install Linux
09:05 - Mint permanently you need to click on
09:08 - this option which says install Linux
09:11 - Mint so just click on the CD option
09:13 - which says install Linux Mint here and
09:16 - now you can see the installation of
09:18 - Linux Mint has been started so in the

09:32 - on the next window you can choose the
09:33 - keyboard layouts in different countries
09:35 - we use different keyboard layouts for

09:45 - will choose German here and then select
09:46 - German if you are not sure then you can
09:49 - click on detect keyboard layout and then

10:08 - multimedia codecs and then click on
10:11 - continue and then we reach to the next
10:14 - stage so this next stage is called
10:17 - installation type and you will see two
10:19 - options here first option is arrays this
10:22 - can install Linux Mint another option is
10:25 - something else
10:26 - so you just need to leave this as
10:28 - default which is erase disk and install
10:30 - Linux Mint don't worry it's not going to
10:33 - erase anything on your host operating
10:35 - system it's just a step in the
10:38 - installation process of Linux Min if you
10:40 - do it on an actual Hardware then it's
10:44 - going to erase everything and install
10:47 - Linux Mint but on the VMware Workstation
10:49 - player it's not going to do anything
10:51 - so just leave it as default and then
10:54 - click on install now which is going to
10:56 - start the installation process of Linux
10:58 - Mint so now you can see write the
11:01 - changes to disk so just click on
11:03 - continue here and then we are on the
11:06 - next window so here you can choose the

11:16 - you can choose the location and then
11:18 - click on continue
11:21 - and here on the next window you need to
11:24 - provide the computer name and your name

11:39 - it as same as my name right so you can
11:43 - see the name is this one computer name
11:45 - is this one
11:47 - and then the username is also the same
11:51 - in my case then provide the password and
11:55 - this password will be used to log into
11:58 - your Linux Mint operating system I will
12:00 - repeat that password and then once you
12:05 - are done click on continue
12:07 - and now at this point you just need to
12:10 - wait for the installation to finish so
12:13 - you can see it's copying all the files
12:15 - then it will start the installation of
12:18 - all the files so at this point you just
12:20 - need to wait for a few minutes and now
12:24 - after some time I can see this message
12:26 - which says installation complete and
12:29 - then at this point I just need to click
12:31 - on the restart Now button which is going
12:34 - to restart my Linux Mint operating
12:36 - system and the installation of Linux

12:58 - installation so I'm going to provide the
13:00 - same password and then press enter and
13:02 - now I'm inside the Linux Mint so you can
13:05 - see the Linux Mint is installation has
13:08 - been finished and because we have
13:10 - installed the VMware tools for Linux
13:15 - we have the option to maximize and
13:18 - minimize our Linux Mint window and it
13:21 - resizes according to the size of
13:23 - the desktop right this is the welcome
13:26 - window so if you want to go through this
13:30 - welcome window you can go through
13:31 - otherwise you can close this window and
13:34 - now you can start using Linux Mint on
13:37 - your VMware Workstation player
13:41 - so this is how you can install Linux
13:44 - Mint on VMware Workstation player I hope
