00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use rating bars in our Android
00:10 - activity now rating bar you can use uh
00:15 - to rate some uh you know some app or
00:18 - some website or uh anything which you
00:21 - want to rate and here is the widget
00:26 - called rating bar which you can use so
00:29 - you can drag and drop this rating bar in
00:31 - your activity and you will be able to
00:34 - use it now there are some properties you
00:38 - can change for this rating bar First
00:41 - Property uh you may be interested in is
00:44 - the number of stars you want to show so
00:47 - once you double click on this uh rating
00:50 - bar the first property comes here is the
00:52 - num Stars which is number of stars for
00:55 - example I want to uh rate out of five
00:59 - stars so I will give the maximum number
01:01 - of stars then the initial rating of the
01:05 - star for example um I want to show
01:08 - initial rating of two on my star bar or
01:11 - rating Star Bar and the third property
01:14 - is the step size how many steps you want
01:18 - to increase in your stars uh once you
01:22 - hover over it and fourth is the property
01:24 - I will leave it as
01:26 - default now what I'm going to do is I'm
01:28 - going to take
01:30 - a large text box here and a button here
01:35 - and I'm going to change the text of this
01:38 - button
01:39 - as
01:42 - submit and now we are ready to uh write
01:46 - the code for this rating bar we will uh
01:50 - create two method one uh which will
01:53 - listen on this uh star click event or
01:58 - you can say uh the rating event and one
02:02 - which will listen to the button click
02:04 - event so I will go to the
02:07 - main activity. Java file and I will
02:10 - first of all I will uh declare these
02:13 - three variables one for button other for
02:17 - uh rating bar and third for text
02:28 - box
02:37 - now we have declared our variables and
02:41 - now we are going to um write a method uh
02:46 - for the button or The Listener for a
02:49 - rating bar okay so we are going to
02:52 - create a public void
02:55 - method public
02:58 - void uh listener for for example uh
03:02 - rating bar so we will create
03:09 - a listener
03:13 - for rating bar okay we are not going to
03:18 - pass any argument in here and inside
03:21 - this uh we will write
03:24 - the uh code okay so first of all we will
03:28 - cast our rating bar
03:39 - itself and same I will do for the text
03:50 - box now what I'm going to do is I'm
03:53 - going to take my rating bar variable
03:56 - which is this one and I will uh
04:00 - call uh set on rating change listener on
04:04 - it okay so I will just take this uh
04:08 - rating B variable dot set
04:14 - on set
04:17 - [Music]
04:19 - on rating change list now okay and in
04:23 - here we will create a new listener for
04:26 - it so we will just write new on on
04:31 - or on rating change
04:34 - listener and then inside this method we
04:38 - can just uh call our text view which is
04:41 - this
04:42 - one
04:44 - dot set
04:47 - text set text and in here we can just uh
04:53 - you know take this uh variable which was
04:56 - automatically create for created for us
04:58 - which is rate in and display inside our
05:03 - uh text view okay so we will convert
05:07 - this rating to the string so I will just
05:09 - write
05:10 - string do value
05:13 - of value of and then the rating which is
05:18 - this variable
05:20 - okay and this uh set rating bar change
05:25 - listener is now ready to use Okay so
05:29 - what I'm going to do is I'm just going
05:31 - to copy this uh method which is uh
05:34 - listener for uh rating bar and I will
05:37 - copy in My oncreate Method okay so I
05:42 - will just copy it and I will run my
05:44 - program now so now my uh app is running
05:48 - so for example I change the rating for
05:52 - example I change it to four you can see
05:56 - the rating changed to four I change the
05:58 - rating to five rating changes to five
06:02 - change rating change to two you can see
06:05 - in the text box rating changes to two
06:08 - right so in this way you can uh prepare
06:12 - The Listener for rating bar change okay
06:17 - now we will use this button to uh you
06:21 - know collect the rating and uh you know
06:24 - display in the form of toast or message
06:28 - right so what we are going to do is we
06:30 - will just make another method which will
06:34 - be
06:35 - public void
06:39 - on
06:42 - button
06:46 - click listener okay we are not going to
06:50 - pass any argument in it and in here we
06:53 - will do the same the casting of the
06:57 - rating bar so rating bar name was was uh
07:00 - rating B
07:01 - here or I will copy the same code which
07:05 - I have uh written in the last uh
07:08 - function or method and in the same way I
07:10 - will cast the button this time okay so
07:14 - just I will cast the
07:20 - button now we will uh set the onclick
07:24 - listener for this uh button variable so
07:27 - we will just
07:29 - use this button variable dot set onclick
07:33 - listener and then we will create a
07:37 - new onclick listen
07:39 - now and inside this we will just create
07:43 - a toast or message for this
07:47 - so toast. make text and by now you may
07:54 - have guessed what are the argument it
07:57 - takes because in the last few videos
07:59 - I've have been showing you how to use
08:01 - this so first argument is the activity
08:04 - name dot this second argument is the
08:09 - text we want to display so we are going
08:13 - to display the rating right so how to
08:16 - get the rating you just need to just uh
08:20 - write string which because we are going
08:22 - to convert this rating from string or
08:26 - from Flo float or from uh integer to the
08:30 - string right dot value of and then we
08:35 - will uh take the rating variable which
08:39 - is rating
08:40 - B dot get rating okay there is a
08:45 - function which we can call to get the
08:47 - rating okay now the third uh variable
08:52 - here is
08:55 - the
08:58 - toast
08:59 - dot length shot you can take and Dot
09:05 - show to show the message okay once again
09:09 - I'm going to uh run this code but first
09:14 - I need to uh you know copy this method
09:16 - to oncreate Method
09:19 - oncreate method is here so I will copy
09:23 - it and now I'm going to rerun my
09:27 - application cancel and rerun the
09:30 - application and now my
09:33 - uh application is running again so I can
09:36 - change the rating like this rating is
09:39 - shown here also and when we click the
09:42 - buttons the submit button you can see
09:45 - the rating in the form of message here
09:48 - right rating three submit button clicked
09:52 - and it's displayed in the form of
09:54 - message right displayed in the form of
09:57 - message okay
09:59 - so in this way you can use uh rating bar
10:02 - in your Android activity I hope you have
