00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part 16 of our laravel
00:07 - for beginners tutorial series and in the
00:10 - previous video we have worked with user
00:12 - authentication and we have laid the
00:16 - modal relationships and in this video
00:19 - we're going to discuss about how to
00:21 - actually implement the user access
00:25 - control so basically we're just going to
00:27 - add a feature that will just enable us
00:30 - to control which pages will our user be
00:34 - able to access so in here let's try to
00:39 - see we have here in our project or home
00:43 - page of our project and as you can see
00:45 - we can always access the post create so
00:54 - if you go to post and then great so we
00:59 - can already create a post even if we
01:02 - have or we are not logged in right so
01:06 - apparently we're not login with our
01:08 - account and we can create certain post
01:13 - but we don't want that the user should
01:15 - login first before they can create a
01:17 - post so also you can see that if we go
01:24 - to blood and then click the post we can
01:28 - see the buttons and edit and delete even
01:33 - if you are not logged in as a user so
01:36 - again we don't want that we want the
01:38 - user to login first before they can
01:40 - modify you can delete and create a post
01:43 - so in order for us to do that let's go
01:45 - back to our code editor and try to
01:48 - modify our project if we go to the
01:51 - controller of our homepage so app and
01:54 - then HTTP controllers and then home
01:58 - controller we can see here we're adding
02:01 - the middle we're both in this construct
02:05 - method so we're just going to copy this
02:07 - for our other con controllers so copy
02:11 - and then we're going
02:13 - to do the same thing for our post
02:15 - controller so that's post and then we're
02:21 - just going to paste the construct method
02:25 - or function coming from the home
02:29 - controller class again we're doing this
02:31 - just to control the access of the non
02:35 - log end users so if you try to go back
02:38 - to our browser so if you try to go to
02:41 - slash a post and then create so we won't
02:48 - be able to create a post right now and
02:50 - it booted us out from the create forum
02:53 - or create post form so it says that we
02:57 - need to log in but there's a problem
03:01 - with this because if you try to go to
03:03 - our blog so it says that we need to
03:06 - login just to view the blogs right so we
03:09 - don't want that and we just want to
03:12 - limit the access when we try to create a
03:15 - post so let's try to accept the other
03:20 - pages for that so in here we need to
03:23 - pass in an array so this will be an
03:27 - array of pages that will be accepted so
03:32 - accept and then the array or the actual
03:37 - array of pages so it's going to be the
03:40 - index and of course the show page sort
03:45 - of say that and go to our browser so we
03:52 - should be able to view the blog so this
03:57 - are the post and we can you just we
04:03 - can't access the create for now right
04:06 - because we're not login oh should be
04:12 - post and then great so try to log in by
04:18 - using our account so log in there you go
04:22 - we can access deep
04:24 - great post and now let's just solve the
04:28 - problem with the individual post if you
04:31 - try to go to a single post you can see
04:35 - even if we get lag out from this page
04:40 - love and then post we can see the edit
04:44 - and delete buttons and we don't want
04:47 - that we just want to see the post
04:50 - without these buttons edit and delete so
04:55 - in order for us to do that let's go to
04:57 - the post so that's where is it resources
05:05 - and then views and post and then show
05:11 - so where's let's go to this part right
05:14 - here when displaying the edit and delete
05:18 - button so I think we're just going to
05:20 - add a certain if statement here so oath
05:25 - and then not guess and then let's just
05:34 - say and if here so basically we're just
05:41 - limiting the access to these buttons and
05:44 - it should be gone there for now so if
05:52 - you are not logged in and you go to a
05:55 - single post you can not edit and delete
05:58 - the post but if we try to lag in by
06:01 - using our account so basically we should
06:06 - be able to have the yeah edit and delete
06:12 - button so log out and go back to that
06:17 - particular post no edit and delete
06:21 - button but also we need to change
06:25 - something here because we need to only
06:29 - show those edit and delete buttons if
06:32 - you are the owner of that particular
06:34 - post so let's go back to the show that
06:37 - later
06:38 - and in here we need to add another if so
06:41 - that will be if and then o'the user so
06:48 - basically we're just going to check if
06:51 - the currently logged in user is the
06:53 - owner of this particular post so that
06:56 - will be post and then the user ID so
07:00 - remember we are we added that particular
07:03 - attribute user ID by using the migration
07:06 - so and we're going to end the if
07:11 - statement here so there you go so you
07:18 - won't be able to access the edit and
07:21 - delete button even if you are logged in
07:25 - if you're not the owner of that
07:28 - particular post so so for example this
07:33 - one so we're not the owner or the
07:35 - currently login user is not the owner of
07:37 - this particular post so but this one is
07:42 - the one posted this particular post so
07:46 - he should be able to edit and delete
07:49 - this post but we need to solve another
07:52 - problem here so as you can see we can
07:56 - edit this particular post but if we try
08:00 - to have like five here this is a post
08:05 - from another user so right so we don't
08:09 - need or we don't want this actual user
08:13 - or this particular user to be editing
08:16 - other post or other users post so what
08:22 - we need is to go to our post controller
08:26 - and in our edit in our ad function we
08:33 - need to have a some sort of check in
08:40 - here so below this one we need to check
08:44 - if the user or authenticated user
08:49 - meaning the login user
08:52 - ID is not equal to the post user ID so
09:04 - again we're just checking a this
09:07 - particular login the user is the owner
09:09 - or not the owner of the post so if is
09:15 - not the owner of the post so it should
09:17 - return read the wreck and then we need
09:22 - to pass in the post it should redirect
09:26 - to the post page and then with an error
09:30 - message so error and then it should say
09:36 - an authorized an authorized page okay so
09:44 - save that and let's go back to our
09:47 - browser and try to go to blog and then
09:53 - first post so the ID is 6 and then edit
09:58 - so if you try to have or put 5 in here
10:03 - so it should say or it should redirect
10:06 - into the post page but I think we don't
10:11 - have the error message here so let's try
10:14 - to add that in our layout so that will
10:19 - be from the layout and then app that
10:22 - laid that PHP we have to include the
10:26 - error messages or messages here in our
10:29 - page so it should be here so in here
10:34 - let's just add the messages layout so
10:39 - include and then i NC folder and then
10:45 - messages so it will refer to the I NC
10:50 - and then messages that made that pay HP
10:53 - so save this and let's go back to the
10:56 - browser and host indeed and 5
11:04 - so it should say an authorised page
11:07 - because we're not authorized to access
11:10 - this post or this particular post and we
11:16 - cannot edit this because this is not the
11:19 - post or this is not a post of this team
11:22 - so user so I think we need to do the
11:26 - same with the delete button also so
11:30 - let's go to the post controller and then
11:33 - we also have the destroy here so I think
11:37 - we're just going to copy the illogic
11:40 - that we have used in our edit function
11:42 - and paste it here in our destroy
11:48 - function so after that so post so if all
11:54 - user ID is not equal to the post user ID
11:58 - so it should redirect to the post page
12:02 - and with an error message of delete so I
12:06 - think that's all there is to it for this
12:08 - tutorial and in this case we have
12:11 - limited the users capability when it
12:14 - comes to the posts that do not belong to
12:18 - them so see you in the next video thanks
