00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java effects tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - the last video we have seen how to use
00:07 - unidirectional binding in Java effects
00:10 - using properties in this video we will
00:13 - see how to use bi-directional binding
00:16 - with an example so let's get started so
00:21 - I have created this sample project in
00:24 - which I have this main dot Java class in
00:28 - which I have added this main dot F XML
00:31 - which I have created here ok and I also
00:35 - have the main controller ok and by now I
00:38 - think you know how to create them
00:40 - everything right now is blank so I'm
00:43 - going to first of all open my main dot F
00:46 - XML file using the scene builder now in
00:50 - the scene builder what I'm going to do
00:51 - is I'm going to go to the controls and
00:54 - I'm going to take a slider from here
00:57 - slider can be of two type horizontal
01:01 - slider and vertical slider and both
01:04 - works in the same way so right now I am
01:07 - going to take a horizontal slider okay
01:11 - and I'm going to take our text field
01:15 - from here so take a text field and now I
01:18 - am going to give them some ID so for the
01:21 - slider I will go to the code and I will
01:24 - give the FX ID slider to it and to the
01:28 - text field I am going to give the ID
01:31 - field for example okay and save your
01:35 - code and one more thing I'm going to do
01:38 - here is I want to link my controller
01:40 - class to this F XML file so go to this
01:43 - controller category on the left hand
01:46 - side and then just choose the
01:49 - application dot main controller from
01:51 - here okay and then save your code and
01:54 - then go to your Eclipse IDE here first
01:59 - of all we are going to implement
02:00 - initialize able so just implement
02:04 - initialize able and implement the
02:07 - unimplemented method from this
02:09 - initialize able interface and now we are
02:13 - going
02:13 - to declare this slider field and the
02:18 - text field so I will just create these
02:21 - two fields and I will import the slider
02:24 - javac scene control from here and one
02:28 - more thing I'm going to do here is I'm
02:30 - going to just declare a private static
02:35 - variable so private static final double
02:40 - and I will say this is my initial value
02:44 - for the slider okay and I'm going to set
02:48 - it as 50 for example okay now I'm going
02:52 - to go to my initialize method and in
02:55 - here we are going to first of all take
02:58 - the slider object and we are going to
03:01 - set the value here so just call a method
03:04 - called set value which takes the double
03:07 - as an argument which is the initial
03:10 - value we want to provide an initial
03:12 - value in our case is 50 so just pass
03:14 - this initial value here and then you
03:18 - need to take this field from here and we
03:22 - are going to set some initial text to it
03:25 - so just call set text and it takes the
03:29 - string but we want to pass this double
03:33 - as a string here okay so we will just
03:37 - write new double and then take your
03:41 - initial value from here and pass it here
03:43 - and then call a two string okay so it
03:46 - will convert this double value to string
03:49 - now next what we want to do is we want
03:52 - to set the bi-directional property to
03:54 - this text field so that whenever we
03:58 - change the slider the text field takes
04:00 - this change or whenever we change the
04:04 - text on the text field then the slider
04:06 - value will change okay so take your
04:09 - field and then call a method called text
04:13 - property okay so just call this text
04:16 - property and then we will call a method
04:18 - called bind bi-directional which is for
04:22 - setting the bi-directional property okay
04:25 - and we are going to take
04:27 - this and now this takes 2 arguments 1st
04:32 - argument is the property of the element
04:35 - which we want to set so we will just
04:37 - take this slider and then call value
04:41 - property of it ok and the second
04:44 - argument is the format of the property
04:47 - we want to change and in our case we
04:50 - want to change the numerical property
04:52 - right so we will just call number format
04:55 - and then we will call a get number
04:59 - instance property on it ok so just call
05:03 - get number instance ok that's it our
05:08 - code is finished now so what I'm going
05:11 - to do here is I'm going to save my code
05:14 - and I'm going to right click on my
05:16 - project and refresh it and then I'm
05:19 - going to run my project and my app is
05:23 - running now and you can see the initial
05:26 - value we have set to the text field and
05:29 - the slider is 50 so slider is in the
05:33 - middle because the minimum value of the
05:35 - slider is 0 and maximum value of the
05:38 - slider is 100 okay so we set 50 so it's
05:42 - in the middle now let's change this
05:45 - slider value so see if what happens in
05:49 - the text field so whenever I change the
05:53 - slider from here it's reflected in the
05:56 - text view right now because it's a
05:59 - bi-directional property we can set some
06:01 - value here for example 70 and the slider
06:05 - goes to 70 right or for example 10 and
06:09 - the slider goes to 10 okay so it's kind
06:13 - of bi-directional binding so it's value
06:17 - is set in the both ways whenever you
06:20 - change the slider it changes the value
06:24 - in the textbox and whenever you change
06:28 - the text box exchanged the well value in
06:32 - the slider and this is how
06:35 - bi-directional binding works in JavaFX
06:38 - so that's it for this video I hope you
06:41 - enjoy
