00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part 7 of our PHP
00:06 - restful api tutorial series and in this
00:10 - video guys we're going to continue
00:12 - working with our create that PHP file
00:16 - and at the end of this video we're going
00:18 - or we should be able to insert record
00:22 - into our database by using our PHP API
00:25 - so let's go ahead and try to modify our
00:30 - gate at PHP so last time we we just
00:33 - added the header you know of course the
00:36 - function in our post at PHP so we have
00:39 - here the great function and we should be
00:44 - able to use that in our create that PHP
00:47 - file so in here we have initialized our
00:51 - API by using our initialize that PHP so
00:55 - basically in initialize that PHP we
00:58 - connected our project into our database
01:02 - so the next step is to instantiate the
01:07 - post so we have we have that here so is
01:11 - we instantiate the post by using the
01:14 - post class and of course applying the
01:16 - database connection so after that we
01:19 - need to get the posted data okay so of
01:27 - course the data should be coming from a
01:29 - request okay so we need to decode that
01:33 - by using file get contents and of course
01:41 - specify that it is a PHP slash slash
01:45 - input okay
01:47 - and then by that we can get the actual
01:51 - data so post we're going to set the
01:56 - title by getting the data and of course
02:02 - the attribute title a so copy and paste
02:06 - this for the other attributes as well
02:08 - so we have the body
02:12 - the author and then we also have the
02:16 - category ID so copy and paste okay okay
02:26 - so after that we can just create the
02:30 - post create post and then we can use the
02:34 - function that we have defined in our
02:37 - post that PHP which is the great so in
02:41 - order for us to do that let's add the
02:44 - post and then call the function great so
02:50 - we're just checking if it is successful
02:52 - or meaning the function returning true
02:56 - okay so if the function return true then
03:01 - we're going to echo a message here or
03:04 - meaning display a message so JSON encode
03:10 - and this is going to be an array so
03:17 - specifying the message which will be
03:21 - post created okay and then of course if
03:27 - the return is not true then we will
03:31 - return I mean we will display another
03:35 - message okay already you can just copy
03:43 - and copy and paste this so the message
03:47 - will be post not created okay so let's
03:53 - try this in our postman software so post
03:57 - mine and this will help us to develop
04:02 - API so if you're serious about working
04:05 - with the API so make sure to download
04:07 - and use postman software so in here we
04:11 - just need to add a another tab okay so
04:18 - instead of using the read underscore
04:22 - single
04:23 - then we're going to add or change this
04:25 - in to create that PHP and of course it
04:30 - should be post because we're sending
04:32 - data into our API and for the headers
04:37 - let's just say content type so as you
04:44 - can see if we try to type in we can have
04:48 - the options and then we can see content
04:53 - it should be content type content type
04:58 - and it should be application slash JSON
05:04 - and of course in our body we can choose
05:08 - raw and then we can specify here the
05:13 - data that we want to pass into our API
05:16 - so we need title for that so basically
05:20 - we're just going to surround our values
05:23 - the key and values with the work out so
05:27 - sample API hose and then comma and then
05:35 - body some point body an API goes from a
05:47 - request and then we have another one for
05:52 - our author so Brad Stevens and third or
06:03 - the fourth one will be the category ID a
06:08 - very ID and then we can say like there
06:14 - are I think we have four categories
06:18 - right now so basically we can choose
06:20 - from one two three and four so we'll
06:23 - just say three and we can send this try
06:28 - and see if our API works so we have an
06:34 - error here
06:37 - we have an error in our SQL syntax so
06:42 - this is posted PHP on line 81 so this is
06:48 - probably the query so post that PHP and
06:53 - then we have the actual query here at
06:56 - the top so I think this one made the
07:01 - error so save that and let's try to test
07:06 - it by sending another request so now we
07:10 - have field created that doesn't have a
07:13 - default value that's because we need to
07:19 - edit the attribute of our post table so
07:26 - as you can see here we have the
07:27 - different attributes category ID title
07:29 - body and author and created that so
07:32 - let's go to structure and now we created
07:37 - at date/time doesn't have a default
07:41 - value so we're going to change that
07:43 - and the default will be the current
07:47 - timestamp okay and then save and let's
07:52 - go back to our postman API or I mean
07:56 - postman software and send another
08:00 - request to test our API so send so
08:05 - sending request and we have the response
08:10 - which says message that the post has
08:14 - been created okay so in order for us to
08:18 - test that there are other ways for us to
08:23 - test this so we can just read all the
08:27 - records so send and there you go we have
08:32 - here the data that has been added
08:36 - recently so the ID is 5 and the sample
08:41 - the title is sample API post which we
08:44 - have specified here so
08:49 - API post and then we also have the body
08:52 - so sample body of an API post Fermi
08:55 - request
08:56 - okay the same and of course the author
08:59 - is Brad Stevens the category ID is pre
09:08 - okay
09:09 - that's what we have specified also here
09:11 - and the category name is Otto so I think
09:17 - that concludes our create that page P or
09:22 - create function or create feature and we
09:26 - have successfully added that into our
09:28 - API so the next step is to create or add
09:32 - the feature for updating the records so
09:37 - we'll work on that in the next video and
09:39 - by the way guys if you're new here in
