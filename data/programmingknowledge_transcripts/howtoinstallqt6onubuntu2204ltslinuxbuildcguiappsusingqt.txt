00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install and
00:04 - use the open source version of QT on
00:07 - your Ubuntu operating system
00:09 - so let's start with the installation
00:11 - first so just open your favorite browser
00:14 - and search for QT and the first link
00:16 - which will appear here will be from
00:18 - qt.io so just click on this official
00:22 - link
00:23 - now here you have few options
00:27 - so on the top you will be able to see
00:30 - try or download QT so just click on this
00:33 - download try button
00:36 - and QT have two different versions they
00:41 - have the commercial version and they
00:43 - also have the open source version
00:46 - so right now we are on the commercial
00:49 - version page you can see you can also
00:52 - see you have this open source user
00:56 - version so we are going to go to the
00:59 - open source link so just click on go to
01:02 - open source
01:04 - and here you will be able to see the
01:07 - open source development page for QT so
01:10 - here if you want you can read all this
01:12 - information and go down and at the very
01:16 - bottom you will be able to see this
01:19 - button which says download the QT online
01:22 - installer
01:24 - so click on that and then you have the
01:27 - option to download QT for Mac OS windows
01:31 - and Linux we are on Linux so we are
01:34 - going to choose Linux here and then
01:36 - click on QT online installer for Linux
01:41 - which is going to download this QT run
01:45 - file right so once this QT dot run file
01:50 - is downloaded let me open the terminal
01:52 - you can open the terminal by pressing
01:55 - Ctrl alt t on your Ubuntu operating
01:59 - system or just go to the applications
02:01 - and then click on Terminal here
02:04 - so once you are on the terminal we are
02:06 - going to CD into our downloads folder
02:09 - and here we can see that this QT unified
02:13 - dot run file is available
02:15 - first of all in order to execute this
02:17 - file we need to change the permission of
02:19 - this file so just try it chmod plus X
02:23 - and the name of the file which is QT
02:26 - unified blah blah blah dot run file
02:30 - so just write QT and then press Tab Key
02:33 - on your keyboard and then it's going to
02:35 - opt to complete the file name and then
02:37 - press enter
02:40 - so the execute permission is granted to
02:43 - this file now we can run this file so
02:46 - just write dot forward slash and the
02:48 - name of the file which is QT
02:50 - and then just run it
02:53 - now if you see these kind of Errors it
02:56 - says error while loading shared
02:58 - libraries that means some dependencies
03:00 - are unmet on your Ubuntu operating
03:03 - system for the installation of QT
03:06 - so in order to uh
03:09 - solve this the easiest way is first of
03:12 - all you need to see which package is
03:16 - complaining so in my case there is this
03:19 - lib xcb package which is complaining
03:23 - right
03:24 - so what I'm going to do here is I'm
03:27 - going to just write
03:30 - apt
03:33 - cache so first of all I will search for
03:37 - this package if it's available so apt
03:39 - cache
03:41 - search and then the name of the package
03:44 - I will just copy
03:47 - until here I don't want to copy this dot
03:49 - so dot uh 0 here so copy and paste
03:54 - hit here and then search for this
03:56 - package and I can see there are two
04:00 - packages which are available to install
04:03 - and we are going to install the first
04:05 - one because other one have the flag Dev
04:08 - right so we are going to install this
04:11 - package to solve this problem
04:13 - so now just write sudo
04:15 - apt
04:17 - install and then you can even write
04:21 - reinstall so if the older version of
04:24 - package is available it will be
04:27 - reinstalled right so we ins
04:30 - tall and then the name of the package
04:33 - which is this one
04:34 - and it came when we've searched for this
04:38 - package right
04:40 - so just write the name of this package
04:42 - and then press enter
04:44 - and
04:46 - it says reinstall so yeah for reinstall
04:50 - I should have given two hyphens here
04:53 - instead of one right and then press
04:55 - enter
04:56 - and now this package will be installed
04:58 - so let's wait for the package to be
05:00 - installed and once this package is
05:02 - installed we can clear the terminal I
05:06 - was using some Jenkins installation
05:09 - earlier so it's saying failed but it's
05:11 - related to Jenkins but this package is
05:14 - installed successfully so right so I'm
05:17 - going to clear
05:18 - the terminal
05:20 - and then try to run this file once again
05:24 - so dot forward slash
05:26 - QT unified dot run file press enter and
05:30 - now the installation starts right
05:34 - so now uh in order to install QT from
05:38 - the official website you need to have a
05:41 - QT account
05:43 - so I already have a QT account if you
05:45 - don't have it you can create this QT
05:48 - account simply by just clicking on sign
05:51 - up and the procedure is really simple
05:54 - right so once you are logged in with
05:56 - your account you can agree with these
05:59 - license terms and conditions so I will
06:01 - click on I have read and agreed on these
06:05 - terms and conditions enter your company
06:08 - name or business name so just write that
06:11 - here and then I can just check this
06:14 - checkbox which says I'm an individual
06:17 - and do not use QT for any company right
06:21 - click on next
06:23 - and then welcome to uh open source QT
06:27 - setup we can click on next here and then
06:30 - after some time it says help us improve
06:34 - QT and QT Creator and then it says help
06:37 - us improve by enabling sending
06:40 - the statistics I don't want to do this
06:43 - so I will check this radio button which
06:45 - says disable sending statistics right
06:48 - click on next
06:49 - and then you have all these options so
06:52 - at this point I want to uh install QT
06:55 - using QT design studio so I will check
06:58 - this checkbox and I want to use QT for
07:00 - desktop development if you want to use
07:03 - QT for mobile development you can also
07:06 - choose this option but for now I just
07:08 - want to use QT for desktop development
07:12 - so I will choose this option you can
07:14 - also choose both of them if you want
07:16 - right then click on next
07:19 - and then click on this checkbox which
07:24 - means you can install cmake using the
07:29 - cmake license agreement click on next
07:31 - and then click on install
07:33 - which is going to start the download of
07:36 - all the essential files and then it's
07:38 - going to start the installation so just
07:41 - wait for some time until this process is
07:44 - finished so once the process of QT
07:46 - installation is finished you can see uh
07:48 - this kind of window which says launch QD
07:51 - Creator open QT Design Studio readme
07:54 - file and you can even launch the QT
07:58 - design studio so I'm going to check this
08:00 - checkbox and then uncheck the readme
08:02 - file here which is going to launch QT
08:05 - Creator and QT Design Studio I'm going
08:08 - to click on finish here
08:09 - which means that the installation of QT
08:12 - is finished and you can see the QT
08:15 - design studio is
08:17 - started so for now I'm going to close
08:20 - this QT designer studio and then you can
08:23 - see this QT Creator here let me close
08:25 - this also you can open this QT Creator
08:30 - and QT designer at any time by searching
08:33 - for them so just search for QT and then
08:36 - you can see this QD Creator you will
08:38 - also see the QT designer so let me open
08:40 - the QT Creator from here
08:43 - once QD Creator is open let's try to
08:45 - create a very simple widget application
08:48 - using QD creator
08:50 - so for that
08:52 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
08:54 - click on create project button here and
08:58 - then you have many options here to
09:01 - create many different applications right
09:04 - see here you have QT widget application
09:06 - console quick application QT quick
09:09 - application compat and then you also
09:12 - have the option to create the QT
09:15 - applications using python what I am
09:18 - going to do is I'm going to choose the
09:20 - first option here which is
09:22 - uh application QT and then I'm going to
09:25 - create a QT widget application and then
09:27 - click on choose and then give the name
09:30 - of your project
09:31 - so I'm going to name my project as
09:35 - my first
09:38 - QT
09:40 - project for example and then click on
09:43 - next this will be the location by the
09:46 - way where your QT project will be saved
09:48 - which is your home folder click on next
09:52 - here you can choose the build system so
09:57 - generally when I develop QT widget
09:59 - application I choose Q make you can also
10:03 - choose cmake for building your
10:06 - applications right
10:08 - click on next
10:09 - these are the default header and CPP
10:13 - files which will be created so if you
10:15 - want to change the name of these headers
10:16 - and cpv files you can change them here
10:20 - for the first time
10:22 - I just want to create the hello world
10:25 - project so I will leave everything as
10:27 - default and then click on next
10:30 - the language you can choose from here if
10:33 - you want some translation but I don't
10:35 - want to do that but if you want to
10:37 - create some kind of
10:40 - translation for your QT application
10:43 - you can choose those languages here so
10:46 - let's say I will choose English UK from
10:49 - here and you can see there is this
10:52 - translation file which is created for me
10:54 - for this English GB right click on next
10:59 - this will be the development kit which
11:03 - is desktop QT 6.5.1 at the time of
11:06 - making this video
11:07 - and then I'm going to click on next here
11:09 - so at this window you can choose the
11:13 - Version Control generally you can choose
11:17 - from git or SVN or any other version
11:21 - control system for now I don't want to
11:23 - choose any Version Control here so I
11:26 - will just click on none but if you want
11:29 - to push your code to a GitHub or any
11:32 - other code repository you can choose git
11:35 - which will enable you to just post your
11:39 - quotes somewhere in some repository
11:41 - right click on finish which is going to
11:43 - create this file right
11:46 - so once you have created
11:48 - your project it will look like this so
11:52 - this project contains dot Pro File which
11:55 - is essentially the file where you define
11:58 - all the header CPP UI files of your
12:02 - project
12:03 - then you have header files by default it
12:06 - creates this win main window.h file then
12:10 - you have the main.cpp file and Main
12:12 - window.cpp file and then you have this
12:15 - translation file which we have created
12:18 - right you also have this forms uh folder
12:22 - where you have this main window.ui so
12:25 - when you click on this mainwindow.ui you
12:28 - will see that you are in the design view
12:32 - of your application
12:34 - by default it's blank here
12:37 - right but you can add some components so
12:42 - for example I can add a label here just
12:44 - search for the label and then drag and
12:47 - drop that label here
12:49 - you can change the object name of your
12:53 - label for example or you can change many
12:57 - properties related to uh your component
13:00 - on the right hand side so for example I
13:04 - want to remove this text label text from
13:08 - this label so I can just move down and
13:12 - there is this text property here so I
13:16 - can just remove this text from here
13:19 - and this label has no text for example
13:23 - right
13:24 - I can also search for
13:27 - push button so I'm going to just drag
13:30 - and drop this push button here I can
13:32 - restize this push button from here and
13:35 - then once again you can change the
13:37 - property of this push button so select
13:39 - this push button and then you have the
13:41 - object name so object name is the name
13:44 - using which you can reference your
13:46 - visual component right so here let's
13:50 - change the text for this push button so
13:53 - I'm going to just go here and then I
13:56 - will just say
13:58 - click me for example and the text is
14:02 - changed right now let's say that when I
14:06 - push this push button
14:08 - we want to change some text or we want
14:11 - to uh show some text in this label in
14:14 - order to add some listener to this
14:16 - button I can just right click on this
14:19 - button and then click on go to slot
14:22 - and then we have many actions here right
14:25 - I'm going to choose clicked option so
14:28 - when this button is clicked I want to
14:31 - perform something right I'm going to
14:33 - click on OK here
14:35 - and then this method is created in my
14:40 - main window.cpp file
14:42 - so here as I mentioned I want to show
14:46 - something when this button is clicked
14:48 - so this label object ID is label right
14:54 - so we want to uh use this label object
14:58 - ID in order to uh show
15:02 - the text right so I can just write UI
15:06 - then I can reference this label by just
15:11 - using its object ID which is label and
15:15 - then I can just call a set text
15:19 - method here so let me just call this set
15:22 - text and you can observe that at every
15:25 - point I have the intellisense right so
15:30 - for example I can just write hello world
15:32 - here and then you can save your code so
15:36 - I'm going to just press Ctrl s to save
15:38 - my code
15:39 - now let's build our code and let's run
15:42 - it so for building and running our code
15:44 - you have this build project button and
15:48 - run project button so let's build it
15:50 - first so just click on this Hammer icon
15:52 - and then click on save all which is
15:55 - going to start building you can see the
15:57 - progress of build here
15:59 - so now I can see uh this kind of error
16:02 - which says user bin LD cannot find this
16:06 - flag here right I don't see this flag
16:09 - directly uh here so what I'm going to do
16:13 - is I'm going to open my terminal open a
16:16 - new terminal and then I'm going to
16:18 - install this so I'm going to just write
16:20 - sudo
16:22 - apt
16:24 - update
16:25 - and then give my password for Ubuntu and
16:29 - once that command is successful let me
16:30 - clear the terminal and then give this
16:33 - command I'm going to give you this
16:35 - command in the description of this video
16:37 - which is apt install lib gl1 hyphen m e
16:41 - s a hyphen Dev press enter
16:45 - and then press y to install it and once
16:48 - that command is finished I can go once
16:50 - again to my QT Creator and then click on
16:54 - build again
16:55 - and this time you can see my build is
16:58 - successful and then I can run this
17:01 - project by clicking on the Run button
17:03 - and my project is running now so I will
17:06 - click on click me which prints hello
17:09 - world on my label right so this is how
17:12 - you can install QT and QT designer on
17:16 - your Ubuntu operating system and create
17:18 - a very simple QT widget application
17:22 - I hope you enjoyed this video and I will
17:23 - see you in the next video
