00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line to troll for
00:04 - beginners in the last video I've shown
00:06 - you how you can change the permissions
00:08 - of the file using chmod in Linux now in
00:12 - this video I am going to show you how we
00:14 - can change the permissions of the
00:16 - directories in Linux using chmod and
00:19 - what are the consequences of changing
00:23 - the directory permissions so let's get
00:26 - started as you can see here I have a
00:28 - directory called dir on my desktop so I
00:32 - will change my directory to desktop
00:35 - first of all and I will do the long
00:38 - listing of this directory so here I will
00:41 - just use L and D because it is a
00:44 - directory and then the directory name
00:47 - which is dir right and press Enter and
00:50 - in here you can see the file permissions
00:52 - now in the last video as I have shown
00:55 - you this first letter shows the type of
00:57 - file or directory so because it's a
00:59 - directory it's showing D here next three
01:02 - values here is the permissions of the
01:06 - user and next three is the permission of
01:09 - the group and the next three is the
01:13 - permissions of everyone else right now
01:16 - let's change the permission of this
01:20 - directory for the user so that we will
01:23 - you know reduce the write capability of
01:27 - the user for example I will just write C
01:30 - H mod here and then I will do user - W
01:35 - which means we are you know subtracting
01:38 - the write permission from the user and
01:41 - the directory name okay
01:43 - so just press ENTER and then I will do
01:46 - the long listing once again and now we
01:49 - can see the user doesn't have the write
01:52 - permission so now you can see there's a
01:57 - lock symbol appears on the directory
02:00 - right so because it doesn't have the
02:03 - write permission that's why this lock
02:05 - symbol appears so let's say we want to
02:09 - Alice the content of the directory so I
02:12 - will just do LS
02:13 - dir for example it shows that this
02:17 - directory has three files right and
02:19 - let's say I will just change to the
02:22 - directory so I will go inside the
02:23 - directory and I will do LS here and in
02:27 - here for example I want to create a new
02:29 - file for example file for so what I will
02:33 - do is I will just use a touch command
02:36 - and I will just write file for here so I
02:39 - want to create a fourth file here and
02:42 - when I press enter you can see it says
02:45 - permission denied because we have you
02:48 - know taken the right permissions from
02:51 - the user so he cannot create any new
02:54 - file inside the directory right now for
02:58 - example I will just go out one step back
03:02 - one directory back to the desktop and
03:05 - now I will just once again give the
03:09 - permissions to the user so write
03:12 - permission I'm just providing so user
03:15 - plus W which once again will provide the
03:19 - write permission to the user and then
03:22 - this time I want to take the read
03:25 - permission from the user okay so I have
03:30 - added the write permission once again
03:32 - and I want to subtract the read
03:34 - permission from the user so let's see
03:37 - what happens when we do this so just
03:39 - write chmod u minus R which will
03:42 - subtract the read permission from the
03:44 - user for the directory and let's do the
03:47 - long listing here just do this long
03:51 - listing and you can see the read
03:53 - permission is taken from the user now
03:56 - right now I will once again go to the
04:01 - directory inside the directory for
04:03 - example so I will do CD dir and we can
04:07 - go inside the directory but when we do
04:10 - LS here you see it says permission
04:13 - Deline so we cannot read the content of
04:16 - the directory we can go inside the
04:18 - directory and we know that this
04:21 - directory contraint contains three files
04:22 - but because we have taken the read
04:25 - permissions from
04:26 - user we cannot read the content of the
04:29 - directory okay so this is when we change
04:33 - or when we take the read permissions
04:36 - from the user so once again I will
04:38 - provide the read permissions to the user
04:41 - so chmod u plus R which will once again
04:45 - give the read permission to the user for
04:47 - this directory and it says this
04:52 - directory okay first of all I need to go
04:55 - to desktop so change directory to the
04:57 - desktop and then provide this command
05:00 - okay and once again I will do long
05:02 - listing of this directory so LS minus LD
05:07 - directory and now we have the read
05:10 - permission also for the user now this
05:13 - time what I want to do is let's take the
05:15 - execute permissions from the user for
05:20 - example so I will just do chmod then
05:23 - user minus X for the directory right and
05:27 - press enter and once again I will do the
05:30 - long listing so LS minus LD for the
05:34 - directory and you can see the execute
05:38 - permissions from the user is taken right
05:40 - so now what I will do once again I will
05:44 - try to go inside the directory which is
05:48 - dir and it says permission denied right
05:53 - so I cannot execute anything with this
05:58 - directory so let's do LS with directory
06:01 - and press enter and this also gives us
06:05 - the permission denied right so it shows
06:09 - the content of the file but access to
06:11 - this files is not possible right so you
06:15 - cannot even go inside the directory so
06:18 - you know you cannot access the content
06:21 - of the file so for example I will do LS
06:24 - minus L long listing of the directory
06:27 - and you can see everywhere it shows the
06:30 - question mark but it shows all the names
06:32 - of the file but the permissions it's not
06:36 - showing because you don't have the
06:37 - permission to
06:38 - see even the permissions of the files
06:43 - inside this directory because we have
06:45 - taken the execute permissions from this
06:47 - directory so this is how you can change
06:51 - the permissions of the directory and
06:53 - this is how the changing of the
06:55 - permissions of the directive behaves so
06:58 - this is the consequences so if you you
07:01 - know remove the execute permissions you
07:04 - cannot you know change the files and you
07:09 - cannot even view the permissions of the
07:11 - file so I hope you enjoyed this video

07:16 - for now
