00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:03 - install Eclipse IDE for developing C and
00:07 - C++ program on your Windows 8 or Windows
00:10 - 8.1 or Windows 7 operating system for
00:14 - downloading and installing eclipse on
00:17 - your system you need three things one is
00:21 - Java runtime environment because eclipse
00:25 - is a Java based IDE second is Eclipse
00:28 - IDE itself for developing C and C++ and
00:32 - third is the compiler which we will use
00:36 - to compile our C or C++ programs so we
00:40 - are going to install them one by one
00:43 - first of all you need to install Java
00:47 - jdk on your system so just search for
00:51 - Java jdk so there is a simple test uh if
00:56 - Java jdk or Java runtime environment is
00:59 - present on your system you just right
01:01 - click your windows uh button here and in
01:05 - here open command prompt and just type
01:09 - Java C and if it gives any response then
01:13 - Java is installed on your system
01:15 - otherwise it's not so I already have
01:18 - Java that's why it has given me the
01:21 - response but if you don't have just
01:23 - search for Java jdk and the first link
01:25 - most probably come here is
01:28 - www.oracle.com this click this uh link
01:31 - and in here just ask me later click ask
01:36 - me later and in here you will find Java
01:40 - okay and at the time of making this
01:42 - video this version Java platform 8 u25
01:46 - is the latest so just click Java don't
01:50 - click net beans net beans is the IDE so
01:53 - click uh this Java button here and in
01:56 - here you need to accept the license
01:59 - terms and conditions and choose uh your
02:01 - operating system my system is Windows 64
02:04 - so I will choose this and in front of
02:07 - this click this executable file and
02:09 - download this okay so I will save this
02:13 - on my system so while this is
02:16 - downloading in the meantime I
02:19 - will install or
02:21 - download this uh compiler which we will
02:25 - use to compile our C in C++ program so
02:29 - there are many options available on
02:31 - internet to download this compiler and I
02:35 - found the compiler which is latest
02:39 - version of of compiler and this site
02:44 - provides this compiler so just search
02:47 - for equation.com
02:49 - www.e equation.com
02:52 - and when you go inside this website you
02:55 - will be able to see this kind of
02:57 - interface and in here you need to go to
02:59 - programming
03:01 - tools and in programming tools you need
03:04 - to click for comma C comma
03:07 - C++ and in here when you go down you
03:11 - will be able to see different uh
03:14 - releases of GCC
03:17 - compiler okay so we want to uh download
03:21 - and install the latest version so I will
03:24 - uh choose the last one which is
03:27 - 4.9.1 and I have 64bit operating system
03:31 - so I will choose this one which says GCC
03:35 - minus
03:36 - 4.9.1 D
03:38 - 64.exe we want to download executable
03:42 - file so make sure it's exe file just
03:44 - click this
03:46 - link and save this
03:48 - file and this will be saved in some
03:51 - moments also and the third option or
03:54 - third thing we need is Eclipse ID itself
03:58 - so search for eclipse
04:00 - download and the first link most
04:02 - probably will come here from
04:04 - eclipse.org g/d download just click this
04:08 - link and in here there are uh different
04:13 - version of eclipse available so there
04:16 - are versions for eclipse for developing
04:18 - Java or developing PHP or other
04:22 - programming language just but what we
04:25 - are interested in is this one Eclipse
04:28 - IDE for C and C+ plus developers right
04:31 - so we want to download This And
04:34 - depending upon the type of your windows
04:36 - if you have Windows 64bit click this one
04:39 - or if you have Windows 32bit click this
04:43 - one so I have windows 64bit so I'm going
04:45 - to click this one Windows 64-bit and now
04:49 - it will uh redirect you to the nearest
04:54 - mirror to you so this is the nearest
04:57 - mirror image of uh Eclipse IDE to my
05:00 - location but it can be different from
05:02 - your location also so just choose this
05:04 - link and
05:06 - download eclipse on your system I will
05:08 - save it so I have three downloads on my
05:13 - PC one is the Java jdk other is the GCC
05:18 - compiler and third is the eclipse uh IDE
05:25 - itself okay so first of all we will
05:28 - install Java jdk I already have but I'm
05:32 - going to show you how you can do it you
05:34 - just need to uh run this uh jdk
05:37 - executable file
05:40 - and so it will uh run this executable
05:44 - file and once it will run this
05:47 - executable file you will be able to
05:50 - install this Java on your system okay so
05:56 - once this installation of java JD DK is
06:00 - complete on your system just need to
06:03 - check whether it's really present on
06:05 - your system or not so I'm going to
06:08 - cancel this install because I already
06:11 - have it but I will tell you what to do
06:14 - next so it says this software is already
06:18 - being installed on your computer so I
06:19 - will say would you like to reinstall no
06:24 - but once you in run this executable file
06:26 - and Java is installed on your system you
06:28 - need to go to your C folder of your
06:31 - computer and in that go to program files
06:35 - and in here in program files you will be
06:37 - able to see this folder called
06:40 - Java and in here you will be able to see
06:43 - two folders one is jdk 8 something and
06:48 - other one is JRE folder I have changed
06:51 - the name of these folder earlier they
06:54 - were something like Java J or they were
06:58 - like jdk K 1 something so as for
07:01 - Simplicity I Chang these name to jdk 8
07:04 - and jre8 jdk inst stands for Java
07:10 - development kit and JRE stand for Java
07:13 - runtime environment so if they are
07:16 - present you what you need to do is go to
07:19 - the jdk folder which says jdk in its
07:23 - initials and go to bin folder in here
07:27 - all your uh binary and executable file
07:30 - will be there so what you need to do is
07:33 - go to your system so search for system
07:37 - and in system you need to set
07:39 - environment variable for Java so in here
07:42 - just go to advanced settings and
07:44 - environment variable and in
07:48 - path go to path and in this path you
07:52 - need to paste
07:55 - this link here so just copy this link
07:59 - and and paste it here after giving a
08:01 - semicolon similarly you need to do it
08:05 - for this JRE folder go to JRE bin and in
08:09 - here just copy this path and give here a
08:13 - semicolon and paste this link here okay
08:17 - so I have already done that so I'm not
08:20 - going to do this because I already have
08:22 - C program files Java /j re8 /bin in here
08:27 - okay so this set
08:29 - JRE and jdk environment variable on your
08:33 - system once you do have done with that
08:36 - we are done installing Java on our
08:39 - system okay the next thing we uh want to
08:43 - do is we will install this GCC so just
08:48 - open this GCC minus 4. whatever version
08:51 - you have
08:52 - installed and just run this executable
08:55 - file on your system so I'm going to run
08:58 - this on my system
09:00 - and here comes the most important part
09:03 - of uh this video which uh we I will show
09:08 - you in a
09:12 - moment so in here you need to accept the
09:14 - terms and condition and here you need to
09:17 - get do the changes so by default this
09:21 - will give you uh some location and this
09:24 - location you need to change because
09:26 - Eclipse search for its IDE uh its
09:29 - compiler at certain location which is
09:33 - fixed so just delete this and just write
09:37 - C colon
09:39 - slash so just write something like this
09:43 - C colon and then back slash and then
09:46 - just write m i n g w and Min GW with a
09:55 - capital so in mean GW m g and W should
09:59 - be capital okay so capital M and small i
10:03 - n and then GW exactly the same path you
10:07 - need to choose now click install and
10:11 - this GCC will be installed on your
10:13 - system in some
10:16 - moments and once it's done by the
10:20 - meantime it's installing we are going to
10:23 - uh extract our Eclipse IDE because it's
10:26 - a zip file uh which you have downloaded
10:31 - so just open this ZIP
10:35 - file and in here it will contain one
10:39 - folder which is Eclipse okay so this
10:42 - Eclipse folder you can extract to your
10:46 - uh C folder and in C folder you can
10:49 - extract to program files otherwise you
10:52 - can extract it on on your preferred
10:55 - location but I will choose to extract
10:58 - this this on my C file so I will go to C
11:03 - and C I will just extract it in my C
11:07 - folder itself okay so I will click okay
11:11 - and this will
11:14 - extract this Eclipse file in here okay
11:19 - so once this Eclipse file will be
11:22 - extracted we will be able to see this
11:26 - folder in my C folder this eclipse
11:29 - folder right and this is the Min GB
11:32 - folder which we have uh installed on our
11:37 - system using this GCC tool which is
11:40 - still running so I will uh let them
11:43 - install and once this both processes are
11:47 - complete then we I will show you how you
11:50 - can uh run Eclipse
11:54 - okay so now GCC is installed in my
11:58 - system and X Eclipse folder is also
12:00 - extracted so I will C uh go inside my C
12:04 - folder and inside my C folder I will
12:06 - find Eclipse folder I will go inside my
12:09 - Eclipse folder and you will be able to
12:10 - see this icon called Eclipse so you can
12:15 - just right click it and you can pin it
12:17 - to the start or pin it to the taskbar so
12:21 - I will pin this to my taskar so that I
12:24 - don't need to go to this location again
12:26 - and again right now I I can just click
12:29 - this icon and Eclipse will start on my
12:33 - system so for the first time whenever
12:36 - you start clipse it workspace and
12:39 - workspace is nothing but the location
12:43 - where all your project will be uh you
12:46 - know stored so this is the default
12:48 - location it will choose to store our
12:53 - programs which is c/ user slash whatever
12:57 - your computer name is SL slash workspace
13:01 - just I will leave them as default this
13:03 - folder as default and click okay and now
13:06 - Eclipse will start on my
13:10 - system so now it's going to
13:24 - start so once this eclipse is started on
13:28 - my on your system you will be able to
13:31 - see this kind of uh
13:33 - IDE so we have successfully installed
13:37 - and run Eclipse now once it's done you
13:42 - can uh go to overview or what's new or
13:45 - samples but uh we are interested in you
13:49 - know making our first uh program for
13:53 - example hello world program right so
13:57 - what we are going to do here is we are
14:00 - going
14:02 - to open this perspective which is this
14:05 - one just click the small C and C++
14:08 - button here and in here what you need to
14:11 - do is now for the first time whenever
14:15 - you run Eclipse we need to do some
14:19 - settings so just go to this Windows uh
14:23 - tab here and in here click preferences
14:27 - and in the general General category here
14:30 - just click this General category
14:32 - triangle and in this uh General category
14:35 - there will be more categories we need to
14:38 - go to this workspace category and in
14:41 - this workpace category in the text file
14:44 - encoding by default it's
14:47 - uh Windows text file encoding but most
14:51 - of the time when we develop C and C++
14:54 - programs uh we want to use utf8
15:00 - okay and in here other in the new text
15:03 - file line delimiter also you need to
15:06 - choose Unix because Unix is the standard
15:10 - uh and using this you will be able to S
15:13 - use your source file on uh other
15:15 - operating system including windows or
15:18 - Linux or other operating system okay
15:21 - apply these changes and click okay once
15:26 - again go to the windows uh tab and click
15:29 - preferences and in
15:31 - here you need to go to this time C and
15:35 - C++ c/c C++ and in here in new c/c++
15:41 - project wizard you need to choose this
15:45 - option which is M GW okay because we
15:49 - have installed M GW GCC so choose this
15:52 - option and click make tool chain
15:55 - preferred okay so once you have done
15:58 - done that apply these changes and click
16:00 - okay and now we are going to create our
16:03 - first C++ program so go to this file
16:06 - tab go to new and then click for example
16:11 - we want to create C++ project click C++
16:14 - project and give the name of your
16:16 - project for example test one is the
16:20 - project name and I want to create Hello
16:23 - World project for me okay so I will
16:26 - choose this and M GW is already our
16:30 - preferred GCC compiler so you don't need
16:32 - to choose this otherwise you can just
16:35 - select this and click
16:37 - next you can uh you know give your
16:41 - author name this these are optional
16:48 - steps but if you want to do this it's
16:51 - okay click next and click
16:56 - finish and once you do this you will be
16:59 - able to see Eclipse has generated a
17:03 - program for you which is this one which
17:06 - is the hello world program
17:09 - okay so now the hello world program is
17:13 - created automatically for us what we
17:15 - need to do is we just need to click this
17:17 - run or this green
17:20 - button
17:25 - and if it says launch binary not found
17:30 - because we haven't compiled our program
17:33 - yet okay so you need to build or compile
17:37 - your program first in order to run it
17:41 - okay so in here go to project and click
17:47 - build all okay so go to project and
17:51 - build all or otherwise there is a option
17:55 - here to build all also so you can choose
18:00 - this icon or you can just choose build
18:02 - all okay so it will build your program
18:07 - and once your program is built it will
18:10 - generate a binary so once this binary is
18:13 - generated when when you click this uh
18:15 - run button it will run your program and
18:18 - it will say hello world which is this
18:22 - message here okay so we have
18:25 - successfully installed Eclipse IDE on
18:27 - our system and we have already created
18:30 - our first Eclipse uh C++ project and we
18:34 - have successfully able to run this
18:37 - project so I hope you have enjoyed this
18:39 - video please wait comment and subscribe
18:40 - and bye for
18:46 - now
