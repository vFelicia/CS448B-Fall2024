00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Android app development for beginners in
00:04 - the last video we have seen how we can
00:06 - apply styles to your components using
00:10 - style.xml file now in this video we will
00:14 - see how we can inherit from one style to
00:17 - another style in Android using style.xml
00:21 - file okay so this is the example I have
00:23 - shown you in the last video so I will go
00:26 - to the style.xml file here and this was
00:29 - the St files we have uh created in the
00:33 - last video now for example if you want
00:36 - to make the style to inherit from other
00:40 - style then what you need to do is for
00:42 - example I want to make this style as a
00:44 - parent style I need to add the attribute
00:47 - called parent and then I need to give
00:51 - the name of this attribute for example I
00:54 - want to give uh this attribute called
00:58 - text appearance
01:00 - large attribute right now in order to
01:03 - inherit from style one to style two all
01:07 - the properties can be inherited from
01:09 - style one to style two if you take the
01:12 - name of style one and put in front of
01:15 - style two name separated by this dot
01:18 - okay so now all the properties from
01:20 - style one can be inherited to the style
01:23 - two right so for example I will delete
01:27 - this layout width and layout height
01:28 - property from from the style two and
01:33 - then I will go to the activity main.xml
01:35 - file here and I will go to the text and
01:39 - In Here Also I should give uh this my
01:42 - style one do my style 2 in the button
01:45 - attribute okay otherwise it will give
01:47 - you the error right now when you see in
01:50 - the design this style is applied to the
01:55 - buttons also which was inherited from
01:58 - the style one right because these button
02:01 - did not have their own layout width and
02:04 - height but it's taking from the style
02:07 - one okay now in the same wave what you
02:12 - can do is you can remove these attribute
02:15 - for example text style and text color
02:17 - right so I will remove this and then
02:20 - once again I will go to the activity XML
02:23 - file and in here you can see the style
02:26 - from style one is inherited in these
02:29 - buttons also so right now you may have
02:32 - observed then when I add some attribute
02:35 - which are similar in style one and style
02:38 - two then style two attributes will be
02:42 - preferred right so style one attributes
02:45 - will be overridden by the style two
02:47 - attribute if they have the same uh item
02:50 - name here right so the preference is
02:53 - given to the child attribute over the
02:56 - parent attribute so now our button will
02:58 - become green and italic right because
03:02 - the preference is given to the child
03:04 - attribute over the parent attribute if
03:07 - they have the same attribute right but
03:10 - this parent attribute will be preferred
03:13 - even in the child attribute for example
03:15 - I have this uh text appearance large
03:18 - here and text appearance for example I
03:20 - make it small here it will not change it
03:25 - so still the text appearance is large
03:29 - here right because the main parent
03:33 - attribute is this text appearance and
03:35 - it's large here right for example I make
03:39 - it small
03:41 - like this and I go here now the text
03:47 - appearance will become the small okay so
03:51 - in this way you can inherit Styles from
03:53 - One style to another style attribute in
03:56 - Android I hope you have enjoyed this
