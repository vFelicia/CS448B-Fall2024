00:00 - so where do we write code in the kotlin
00:02 - language
00:03 - so i have told you that we use the ide
00:07 - as the android studio for development of
00:09 - android apps that is xml and kotlin both
00:11 - work simultaneously on android studio
00:14 - and now
00:17 - we have to focus only on kotlin
00:20 - so therefore we need an another ide for
00:23 - writing only hotline code and that id is
00:26 - intellij idea
00:29 - so what is intelligent idea used for
00:31 - intellij idea is an integrated
00:33 - integrated development environment ide
00:36 - or jvm languages
00:38 - including java kotlin designed to
00:41 - maximize developers productivity okay
00:44 - so just like android studio uses sdk
00:48 - software development kit similarly
00:50 - individual idea uses jdk java
00:52 - development kit or
00:54 - that we
00:56 - we will be installing in the next video
00:59 - and i'll be explaining what jdk is in
