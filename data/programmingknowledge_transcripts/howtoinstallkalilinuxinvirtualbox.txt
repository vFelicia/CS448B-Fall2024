00:01 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can install Ki Linux on
00:05 - your Oracle virtual box virtual machine
00:09 - so let's get started first of all uh you
00:11 - need to have Ki Linux ISO file in order
00:15 - to install it on your virtual box so
00:19 - hopefully you all have virtual box and
00:22 - to get the ISO file for KI Linux you
00:25 - just need to open your favorite browser
00:28 - and search for k Linux here and in here
00:32 - the first link which will appear here
00:33 - will be from kali.org
00:36 - and you can see the download uh link
00:39 - from here but we are going to open the
00:42 - k.org first and then we will uh just
00:46 - click the download uh link from here so
00:48 - you just need to click this download uh
00:52 - link from here and then in here you will
00:56 - be able to find different uh versions of
01:00 - Al Linux right the one I have downloaded
01:03 - is this one which is ISO file for
01:06 - 64bit okay so it's 2.6 GB file so it
01:12 - will take some time to download so just
01:15 - download this ISS file which is the
01:18 - first option here so after downloading
01:21 - this file it's going to look like this
01:24 - it's uh a Kali hyphen Linux hyphen 2016
01:30 - one hyphen AMD 64. ISO file okay so once
01:35 - this file is downloaded we are ready to
01:38 - uh you know install it on our virtual
01:41 - box so just open your virtual box uh
01:45 - virtual machine and in here we are going
01:47 - to create a new virtual machine so just
01:50 - click this button which says new and in
01:53 - here we will first of all provide the
01:56 - name of our virtual machine for example
02:00 - Ki and then it's uh Linux operating
02:04 - system so we need to choose the type
02:07 - Linux and in here you will not be able
02:09 - to find the Ki option Ki Linux option
02:13 - here right so the one we are going to
02:16 - choose here is Debian 64 which is this
02:19 - option okay so just choose this option
02:22 - which says Debian 64 bit and then click
02:26 - next and in here you can choose the
02:28 - memory size so I'm going to give the
02:32 - memory to my virtual machine up to for
02:36 - example 4 GB okay and then I'm going to
02:40 - click next and in here it says uh hard
02:45 - drive so we are going to create uh
02:47 - virtual hard drive for now so just
02:50 - choose this second option which says
02:53 - create a virtual hard drive now and then
02:56 - just click create okay and in here you
03:00 - will be asked hard drive file type so we
03:04 - want to make a vdi file so just leave it
03:09 - as default which is the first option uh
03:11 - checked and then click next and in here
03:15 - it will ask you for the storage on the
03:18 - physical hard drive we want to have the
03:22 - dynamically uh allocated storage okay so
03:25 - it's not fixed size but it will uh be
03:28 - grown dynamic Ally so just choose the
03:31 - first option here which is dynamically
03:33 - allocated and then click next and then
03:37 - here you can uh allocate the you know
03:41 - memory to your uh you know device so for
03:44 - example I want to give around 20 GB to
03:48 - my virtual machine so I'm going to just
03:52 - uh move it to 20 GB and then I will just
03:55 - click create and it's going to create
03:58 - this call
04:00 - uh virtual machine here okay now once
04:04 - you created your virtual machine you can
04:07 - choose this uh virtual machine which is
04:09 - Ki and we are going to do some settings
04:13 - from here because we haven't given the
04:15 - path of uh the ISO file yet right so
04:19 - just choose uh this option Ki and then
04:22 - click this button which says settings
04:25 - and in here first of all we are going to
04:27 - go to uh system here and and you can see
04:30 - we have given 4GB memory to our uh
04:33 - virtual machine and just choose this
04:35 - option which says processor and by
04:38 - default it's uh given One processor for
04:42 - this virtual machine right so we can
04:45 - increase it to four so this depends upon
04:48 - you how many number of processors you
04:51 - want to give to your virtual machine I
04:53 - want to give for processors right
04:57 - now uh we are going to choose this
04:59 - option which says storage and in the
05:03 - storage we are going to go to controller
05:06 - IDE and then choose Host Drive D okay so

05:30 - the first option which says choose a
05:32 - virtual CD DVD disk file okay and from
05:36 - here you can just provide the path to
05:39 - your ISO file which you have downloaded
05:42 - okay so just choose the ISO file which
05:45 - you have downloaded and then click open
05:48 - and I'm going to minimize this first of
05:50 - all so now you have given the path for
05:53 - your ISO file for K Linux right so we
05:57 - are going to just click okay and then we
06:00 - are ready to start our virtual machine
06:02 - so just choose the option Ki and then
06:05 - just click this button which says
