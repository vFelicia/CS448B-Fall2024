00:00 - in this particular video we are going to
00:01 - learn about the nslookup command okay so
00:03 - basically this command is used to find
00:05 - uh like information about the DNS record
00:08 - Okay so
00:10 - previously in the host command we have
00:12 - find the DNS record so and already we
00:14 - have covered what is the domain name
00:16 - server like it is used to change the
00:19 - domain name to the IP address and vice
00:21 - versa and also various DNS records like
00:24 - CNN record we have covered and txt
00:27 - record
00:30 - record we have covered okay so many
00:34 - records we have covered till now and we
00:36 - will use this NS logo command to get
00:39 - information about these particular
00:40 - records
00:42 - okay so let's start with the first basic
00:44 - one
00:46 - start with google.com
00:49 - okay let me close this caps lock okay
00:52 - let's look up google.com
00:55 - okay done here you can see the address
00:57 - that is this is ipv4 address and this is
01:00 - IPv6 address okay so uh you can like
01:04 - what do we say use this
01:07 - like this also you can use in this look
01:10 - of hyphen type equal to it means you are
01:12 - just defining the what type of record
01:14 - you want okay it may be a record okay
01:17 - let's search for area code iPhone type A
01:20 - and just provide the
01:22 - domain name and here you will get the
01:24 - address
01:25 - okay so in this you are getting this let
01:27 - me search for another domain name let's
01:29 - take some another domain name what
01:32 - should we take
01:34 - uh I'm not getting
01:36 - okay facebook.com
01:40 - okay so here you can see this is the
01:42 - particular IP address of facebook.com
01:45 - and this is for google.com
01:48 - so let me uh just copy this
01:52 - IP address and paste it in the browser
01:55 - whether we can access it or not
01:59 - let me just paste it here
02:02 - okay I think I'm not copied it
02:07 - okay just copy it
02:11 - and I will just open up the
02:16 - okay here I will paste it let's say
02:19 - whether it is accessible or not
02:21 - google.com with this iPad is okay so it
02:23 - is accessible
02:25 - and similarly we will try for our this
02:28 - one
02:31 - facebook.com I don't think it will be
02:33 - accessible
02:36 - let's still let's try
02:43 - okay it's showing not recommended
02:48 - I will accept a risk let's say what
02:50 - happens
02:52 - is
02:55 - I hope you have watched a scam
02:59 - okay so here we you can see uh we are on
03:03 - this facebook.com page okay it means we
03:05 - can uh go on this particular page using
03:09 - IP address
03:12 - okay so moving forward uh if you want to
03:15 - get a record of like 4A record like a a
03:19 - a a and a okay I hope I
03:23 - counted five
03:27 - okay
03:29 - so here you can see the
03:32 - version 6 like IPv6 address of
03:34 - facebook.com now let's try some another
03:37 - record for another domain uh let me
03:40 - check for a record for some other
03:42 - another domain like I will now I will go
03:44 - for YouTube
03:48 - okay here you can see the IP address of
03:51 - YouTube I we know it may be accessible
03:53 - or not accessible using IP address okay
03:55 - that particular domain so now moving
03:58 - forward to the different records so we
04:00 - will search for the
04:02 - uh
04:03 - txt record
04:05 - okay let's search for txt
04:08 - iPhone type equal to txt youtube.com
04:12 - Okay so here you can see this is the
04:14 - Google side verification some kind of
04:16 - text is stored
04:18 - okay and
04:21 - if I go with some different domain name
04:24 - like
04:25 - Facebook
04:27 - okay let's check okay
04:31 - these are the texts
04:34 - okay let's check for some another domain

04:48 - there
04:50 - atlassian
04:52 - OnePlus domain verification okay many
04:54 - things are there
04:56 - and now moving forward let's check for
04:58 - the MX recall that is the mail exchange
05:01 - record okay it it is basically we use it
05:04 - to like sending the mail or receiving
05:05 - the mail from
05:07 - from any sender okay
05:11 - so let's use it I will just uh change
05:15 - this
05:16 - from type to MX
05:19 - and this is you can see the mail
05:21 - exchange which is smtp.google.com okay
05:24 - we have used this command like for like
05:27 - big giant so why not to use these
05:29 - command for the small uh
05:31 - websites like let's take some let me
05:35 - search it search it for
05:37 - um
05:39 - I will open up Chrome here
05:42 - I think into this Firefox will take much
05:45 - time in this
05:47 - okay we are here
05:50 - just search for Linux commands
05:56 - okay so let me take Java T Point okay
06:01 - um yeah
06:03 - let me close this okay now I will use
06:08 - Java T point a record
06:13 - Java t point.com
06:17 - okay so here you can see this is the a
06:19 - record
06:20 - and here you can see true IP addresses
06:22 - are pointing to the same domain uh let
06:25 - me check I will just copy this IP
06:27 - address
06:29 - and I will put it in my
06:33 - browser let's check what happens whether
06:36 - it is accessible or not I don't know why
06:38 - it's not working of
06:41 - bi-directional copy paste is not here I
06:44 - think let me enable those settings here
06:47 - I think now it should work
06:50 - Ctrl shift C
06:54 - oh yeah now it's working okay so here
06:56 - you can see uh direct ipx is not allowed
07:00 - for Java depend let me check the another
07:01 - IP address

07:07 - think let's see what happens
07:09 - okay same same thing like director IP
07:11 - access is not allowed so I hope you got
07:14 - it how you can find the different
07:15 - records using NX lookup command so
