00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:03 - Java programming tutorial for beginners
00:05 - in this video we will see what is an
00:08 - exception in Java and how we can handle
00:11 - exceptions in Java using try catch block
00:15 - so first of all what is an exception by
00:19 - the official definition an exception is
00:22 - an event which occurs during the
00:25 - execution of the program which can
00:28 - disrupt the normal flow of the program's
00:31 - instruction ok so let me give you an
00:35 - example for example I declare an integer
00:38 - variable and I initialize it by some
00:41 - value for example 100 okay and then I
00:45 - divide it by 0 and we all know that
00:49 - whenever some integer is divided by 0 it
00:53 - gives us infinity and Java program is
00:58 - not able to handle this situation
01:02 - right so let's try to print something
01:06 - for example this out and I'm going to
01:11 - print this line after the Declaration of
01:17 - this variable like this so when I run
01:21 - the program if I see this that means
01:24 - this declaration is valid for me right
01:27 - because this initialization is
01:30 - successful and I will be able to see
01:31 - this line if I will not be able to see
01:35 - this line that means the initialization
01:37 - fails so I'm going to save this program
01:39 - and I'm going to run my program and you
01:43 - see in the console the exception in
01:46 - thread mean occurs and Java gives us the
01:49 - location of the exception or error and
01:53 - this is at line 6 which is this one
01:57 - right and which exception occurs here
02:00 - are a thematic exception occurs so this
02:04 - infinity is not handled by the Java okay
02:10 - now in these situation where
02:14 - our Java is not able to handle this
02:18 - exceptional situation what we can do is
02:21 - we can catch this exception by using a
02:25 - try/catch block so normally how we can
02:29 - write a try-catch block just write try
02:32 - and then this curly braces and end the
02:38 - curly brace and after that you need a
02:41 - catch
02:41 - so catch and in the brackets you give
02:47 - the situation which you want to handle
02:50 - and in here in the catch you can print
02:54 - the situation or you can do whatever you
02:57 - want to do after handling the
03:00 - exceptional situation okay so now I'm
03:04 - going to place my code inside this try
03:08 - catch block okay and here is the
03:13 - exception we want to handle so this code
03:16 - is throwing this exception called
03:18 - arithmetic exception okay
03:21 - so we want to handle this here so just
03:23 - write arithmetic exception and then give
03:26 - the variable name okay and in here you
03:30 - can even print this value of the
03:34 - exception which is thrown which is this
03:36 - exception exactly but let's run the
03:39 - program and then see what happens so now
03:43 - when I run the program I can see this
03:46 - line printed that means the exception is
03:50 - thrown but it's caught by this try catch
03:53 - block and then we come to the next line
03:55 - of code and we are able to print this
03:59 - line now in order to handle the
04:02 - situation after the exception so for
04:04 - example we want to know which exception
04:07 - is thrown by this try catch block inside
04:10 - this we can handle this situation of
04:13 - exception for example I want to print
04:16 - this exceptional situation so this are a
04:19 - thematic exception will handle this
04:22 - infinity situation and we can print it
04:25 - using this
04:27 - II object of an automatic operation so
04:29 - we to print this exception we can just
04:32 - write system.out.print line and II okay
04:35 - and let's save this program and run it
04:38 - once again and now we can see this
04:42 - exception is printed this is due to this
04:45 - line okay and then our normal program
04:49 - execution is happening which is printing
04:52 - this line okay now in this try-catch
04:57 - block you can add multiple catch block
05:00 - so you can handle multiple you know
05:03 - exceptional situations okay so for
05:07 - example I can do something like this I'm
05:12 - catching this exceptional automatic as
05:15 - exception and I want to handle one more
05:19 - exception which is the general kind of
05:21 - exception I don't know what kind of
05:22 - exception this is this so I will use
05:26 - this general exception okay and then I'm
05:30 - going to print this okay and now also
05:33 - it's going to execute the same program
05:36 - in the same way but in the case of
05:41 - exception other than this exception
05:44 - which is this one this code is going to
05:48 - execute okay so now let's add some more
05:52 - exceptional situation so for example I
05:55 - will declare a variable which is an
05:59 - array outside my try-catch block and
06:02 - inside my try-catch block I want to
06:05 - print the third element of the array we
06:10 - know that the initialization of array is
06:14 - with index two so third element is out
06:17 - of scope of this array right so let's
06:21 - print this and I'm going to declare it
06:25 - as variable B because a is already here
06:28 - okay and I'm going to print here the
06:33 - value of B 3 so the value of B at index
06:38 - 3 okay
06:40 - and I'm just going to write
06:44 - and plus okay this I want to execute now
06:49 - let's see what happens I'm going to save
06:52 - this program and run this and it's going
06:55 - to give me this automatic up or
06:57 - exception once again due to this line so
07:01 - let's let me comment this line for now
07:04 - okay and let me save this once again and
07:07 - run the program once again and now you
07:10 - can see this exception different
07:14 - exception is thrown and which is caught
07:17 - by this bigger exception or the
07:19 - exception which has a more priority for
07:23 - example okay so this exception which is
07:29 - array index out of bounds exception is
07:32 - handled by this general exception here
07:35 - which is this line okay so if you don't
07:39 - believe me let's comment this code and
07:43 - this code here okay so and let's run the
07:48 - program once again and you see the same
07:52 - exception so it is caught by this
07:54 - exception okay you can even do just copy
07:59 - this exceptional condition here and
08:02 - paste it here okay and then it's going
08:05 - to give the same result which is array
08:09 - index out of bounds exception
08:11 - okay so exception class is a general
08:15 - class if you don't know which exception
08:18 - is thrown by your code you can use this
08:21 - exception otherwise if you know that
08:24 - your code can you know throw arithmetic
08:28 - exception or array index out of bounds
08:30 - exception then you can you know handle
08:34 - the specific exception and always
08:38 - remember that you can add multiple catch
08:41 - blocks with your try block okay so one
08:45 - catch block to catch block you can even
08:48 - handle three cache block and in this
08:52 - situation for example I want to handle
08:54 - this array index out of bound
08:58 - and when you do something like this is
09:02 - going to give you this error bubble here
09:05 - and it says unreachable catch or let me
09:10 - save the program and run it and let's
09:13 - say what it says it's a unreachable
09:16 - catch block why because this general
09:21 - exception class has more priority than
09:25 - this array index out of bounds exception
09:28 - so this should come at the last okay so
09:33 - when I do something like this I'm going
09:36 - to cut this and I'm going to paste just
09:39 - below this array out of bound exception
09:43 - here then my error will be gone so
09:46 - always remember this exception class
09:49 - should go at the last okay and other
09:54 - exception like arithmetic or index out
09:58 - of bound will be above it because they
10:01 - have the lesser priority okay and it's
10:04 - this exception is more general exception
10:07 - you want to handle okay so in this way
10:12 - exception works in Java and you can
10:15 - handle exceptions using try catch block
