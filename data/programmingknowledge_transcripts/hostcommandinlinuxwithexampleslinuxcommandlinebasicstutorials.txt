00:00 - on this particular video we are going to
00:01 - learn about
00:03 - host command okay so basically this
00:05 - command used for the DNS lookup it
00:07 - basically means you are going to find
00:09 - information about the DNS servers as
00:11 - well the IP addresses of a domain name
00:14 - or or domain name with IP address you
00:18 - can say so but before moving forward in
00:20 - this particular video you should know
00:22 - the basics of domain name server okay so
00:25 - this is a basically one of the
00:26 - networking Concept in which we will
00:30 - learn okay
00:31 - in the following topics like actually
00:33 - have written already one blog on DNS
00:35 - so you can go and learn from this
00:37 - infosec write-ups and if you will search
00:40 - for all about DNS
00:42 - 100 days of hacking you will get it let
00:44 - me search it for you
00:50 - info stick write-ups
00:55 - okay so this is the first one write up
00:57 - by ayush Verma okay you can get it from
01:00 - here
01:01 - so let me tell you the basic idea of
01:03 - what is this domain name server and all
01:06 - these things so basically DNS stands for
01:09 - domain name server okay
01:11 - it means the whatever the your
01:14 - google.com it is a domain name it will
01:17 - get converted into the IP address or
01:19 - vice versa or IP address will get
01:21 - converted into the domain
01:24 - so with the main reason behind this is
01:26 - romanium service why this domain name
01:28 - server came in a role okay so just think
01:32 - like a normal human if you uh you are
01:35 - given a one address like 192.168.42.35
01:40 - whether this is easily remember easy to
01:44 - remember or google.com is easy to
01:46 - remember okay just think once so
01:48 - obviously you will say like sorry
01:50 - google.com is easy to remember that's
01:52 - why that is the main reason behind this
01:54 - of DNS that's why it came in a role
01:56 - so we will see the basically working of
01:59 - how it basically Works uh let me move
02:02 - down
02:04 - as here you can see the I have written
02:06 - like in more explanation I have given
02:09 - here you can learn it
02:10 - and also how it works I will tell you
02:13 - and this is the domain High key like
02:15 - root level domain top level domain
02:17 - second level domain like.com dot
02:20 - government Dot
02:22 - mil these are the root level domains
02:24 - okay
02:25 - and try hack my Google USA sub domains
02:29 - okay so you can learn all about these
02:31 - things and now let's moving forward to
02:34 - the working of
02:36 - this DNS okay so whenever user types in
02:40 - web address this particular
02:42 - main name what happens in this case it
02:45 - will first do the DNS query from where
02:47 - DNS resolver okay DNS is always also one
02:50 - of the part of this particular process
02:52 - where summary codes are stored now next
02:56 - what will happen it will send the
02:57 - request to this root server whether if
02:59 - the
03:00 - domain.com or dot anything it will move
03:03 - to the root server it will ask for do
03:05 - you have this IP address of this
03:07 - particular domain if it will say yes
03:09 - then it will forward the request
03:12 - then again for this step it will go with
03:14 - the TLD server and again with authority
03:16 - name server and after that it will go to
03:20 - the main server of that particular
03:22 - website after getting the IP address
03:24 - okay so this is the overall working of
03:26 - this domain name server
03:28 - and now we will talk about the what are
03:31 - the records in DNS okay so basically DNS
03:35 - request provide the information about
03:36 - the particular domain
03:38 - so I will
03:40 - like go down and let me tell you the
03:43 - Rook records okay
03:44 - so these are the basically some of the
03:46 - records like a records this four a
03:49 - records MX record CNN record you can
03:51 - learn about these all things like ad
03:53 - cost provide us the ipv4 addresses and
03:56 - AAA and also one more Ray that is a 4A
03:59 - record providers the IPv6 address mxley
04:02 - cost provide us the
04:04 - like Mail Exchange address CNM record is
04:07 - also provides like uh like it points the
04:09 - subdomain to the main domain basically
04:11 - if there is a
04:13 - gmail.google.com or google.com both will
04:16 - point to the only single domain or it's
04:18 - not domain single IP addresses okay
04:22 - now moving this is the name server
04:24 - record that is NS records okay and txtd
04:27 - code is some kind of record that
04:29 - administered some kind of text and all
04:31 - these things okay now let's move to our
04:34 - main motive of this particular video
04:36 - that is the host command okay
04:39 - so I hope you got to learn about all
04:40 - those things about DNS records
04:43 - I hope it is visible to you let me just
04:45 - increase the size first so that it will
04:48 - be easy to
04:50 - it will be easily visible okay
04:53 - so now let's enter the host
04:55 - and just provide the google.com
04:59 - okay oh wait a minute
05:01 - [Music]
05:04 - okay uh let's see I'm getting some kind
05:06 - of error
05:12 - okay
05:13 - host
05:16 - google.com
05:19 - Okay google.com not found why like this
05:26 - post
05:28 - okay it's working
05:36 - okay let me provide another iPad another
05:39 - domain name like uh let me provide Gmail
05:44 - foreign
05:49 - .com not found okay while this is
05:53 - happening I'm not getting
05:57 - let me do first thing whether it's
05:59 - working or not
06:02 - temporary failure in name resolution
06:06 - let me ping another some domain name
06:08 - that is a
06:10 - uh
06:12 - which two Magnum should I
06:16 - let me check here medium.com let me do
06:23 - t com
06:25 - why it's happening I'm not getting uh
06:27 - let me uh restart my this Ubuntu machine
06:30 - so that
06:32 - after it may be uh work let me do
06:36 - okay now I have started restarting my PC
06:39 - uh let me now perform the that command
06:43 - okay so I hope it is visible to you uh
06:45 - let's do host google.com
06:51 - okay so here you can see the address of
06:53 - google.com that is uh that is the ipv4
06:56 - that is what does ipv4 address mean it
06:58 - means that it is a like 32-bit address I
07:01 - guess okay if I'm not wrong uh let me
07:04 - check why to create confusion for you
07:07 - guys okay
07:08 - IP address
07:10 - bit
07:12 - size okay
07:14 - I hope it is 32 yeah I was correct okay
07:16 - it's 32-bit address
07:18 - it ranges from 0 to 20 0 2 to double
07:21 - five
07:22 - okay so here you can see the IP
07:25 - addresses of google.com that is
07:28 - 172.217.27.2.6 and again with with same
07:31 - like you will get this IPv6 address so
07:34 - that this is the
07:35 - like version 6 addresses of google.com
07:37 - and the mail server address that is MTP
07:41 - now what will happen
07:42 - if you will think about the concept of
07:45 - DNS what is happening here is when you
07:48 - are entering google.com
07:50 - so that domain is mapped with this
07:53 - particular IP address this one
07:55 - let me copy this IP address and let me
08:00 - put it here what will happen whether it
08:03 - will go on to the google.com or not
08:05 - let's check
08:10 - okay damn so here you can see that that
08:14 - IP address is mapped to the google.com
08:17 - that's why
08:18 - like we are going on this particular
08:21 - domain name what will happen if I will
08:24 - see I will just
08:26 - change.206 to 205 whether it will go to
08:28 - the same or different let's check
08:31 - okay it's going to the same
08:33 - because that per whole IP address may be
08:36 - belonging to that particular google.com
08:40 - let me do two double zero
08:43 - okay it's same okay so now uh let's go
08:47 - for some another domain also host uh
08:50 - let's go with medium.com
08:53 - like sometimes it happens like uh you
08:56 - can't go on a particular okay I press
08:59 - something like print okay
09:03 - when sometimes what happens when you
09:05 - enter the IP address of some of the
09:07 - domain name then at that time you will
09:09 - not be able to reach that particular
09:11 - domain because of firewall
09:13 - implementation and all
09:16 - so here also you can see different IP
09:18 - addresses mail servers okay so let me
09:21 - check this one
09:23 - one five three Dot
09:25 - four
09:30 - okay let's check whether it goes or not
09:32 - okay so yeah here you can see the direct
09:35 - iPad is not allowed why because I think
09:37 - they are using cloudflare
09:40 - Cloud Player they are using yes
09:42 - your IP here I will get my IP address
09:45 - okay
09:47 - so sometimes it doesn't allow okay now
09:51 - moving forward in this particular video
09:54 - with the getting the DNS records of a
09:57 - particular domain name okay
09:59 - so how you can get it like uh using
10:02 - hyphen T option we can get and also if
10:06 - you want to get only the IPv6 address
10:08 - you can get if it is available
10:12 - so here you can see connection is
10:14 - refused
10:16 - now let's check with the CNM record okay
10:18 - so if you don't know about CNM record
10:20 - you can go here and learn about it
10:23 - on this particular block okay
10:28 - domain to another domain for example you
10:31 - can see blog.example.com has a CNM
10:34 - record with a value of example.com This
10:36 - Means whenever DNS record hits the DNS
10:39 - record for blocked example it actually
10:41 - triggers another DNS lookup to which
10:44 - domain that is the example domain
10:47 - and it basically turns the IP of the
10:49 - same that is main domain name
10:51 - example.com domain okay
10:55 - so uh let's do the DNS look of all this
10:58 - particular record that is which one CNM
11:01 - record
11:02 - so the command is very simple host
11:05 - hyphen T C name and you have to just
11:08 - write any domain name which you want
11:09 - let's do with google.com
11:12 - okay it has no any record
11:15 - uh maybe it will be for medium
11:18 - let's check
11:20 - okay no records
11:23 - uh any website
11:28 - okay
11:30 - let me search for
11:33 - random colleges
11:37 - in Delhi
11:40 - if I get any college website now let's
11:42 - go with the siksha.com
11:52 - copy it
11:55 - and just paste it here
12:04 - okay so here we are getting the
12:08 - okay not found
12:10 - okay
12:13 - so these sites are not having any CM
12:15 - because let's go with some another
12:17 - record
12:18 - uh let me check with the MX record that
12:20 - is the main election it should be there
12:22 - yeah it has a mixed record let's go for
12:26 - uh gold medium.com
12:32 - yeah they are using
12:34 - MX record okay and let's check for
12:37 - another record that is a txt record
12:42 - okay we are getting it here all those
12:44 - records
12:46 - uh let's check for
12:49 - okay another website that is shiksha
12:52 - hyphen ttxt record
12:57 - okay we are getting all those
12:59 - information whatever the
13:01 - Act is stored in this particular text
13:03 - file in the DNS records okay
13:05 - so I hope you like this particular video
13:07 - and today we will stop here and the next
13:10 - video we will learn about something new
13:11 - okay so that's all for today's video and
13:13 - if you have any queries then please ask
13:14 - us in the comment section so thank you
13:16 - thank you for watching and we'll meet in
