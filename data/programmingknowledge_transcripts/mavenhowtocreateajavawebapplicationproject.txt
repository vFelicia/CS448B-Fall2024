00:01 - hello and welcome back to the new video
00:03 - of the maven tutorial series uh so till
00:06 - now we have covered in our previous
00:07 - video we have covered about uh how we
00:10 - can create and manage a multi-module
00:12 - projects uh and we have also seen one
00:15 - example by creating one project of with
00:19 - Maven and we have created util core and
00:21 - UI all these modules and we have seen
00:23 - how one modules uh functionality or the
00:27 - classes so we can use in inside the
00:28 - another model that part we have covered
00:30 - inside uh in our previous video I hope
00:33 - you I hope you watch that video if you
00:35 - don't please go and watch that video and
00:37 - then come on come again in this video
00:39 - and watch this okay so for this video we
00:42 - will be uh starting uh to create a web
00:44 - application with Maven so till now we
00:47 - have covered how to create a simple
00:50 - Maven project whether it is
00:52 - multi-moduled or not single model okay
00:55 - but now we have going to create a maven
01:00 - project with a web application okay so
01:02 - we are creating a web application okay
01:04 - so let's go and in our IDE
01:08 - so this is the first screen that you
01:10 - will see so I will just go ahead and
01:14 - click on the new project so you do do
01:17 - that but now you can see uh once you are
01:20 - opening for the first time you're going
01:22 - to click on the new project
01:23 - you see a various uh generators over
01:27 - here like Maven Java FX kotlin compose
01:30 - Android you just click on the mavina
01:32 - archetype and just name your project so
01:35 - I'm gonna name it name my project as
01:40 - my
01:42 - first
01:44 - web app okay so you can name anything to
01:48 - your project uh that's not any problem
01:51 - if you want to create git repository you
01:53 - just click checkbox this I don't want to
01:57 - go inside get GitHub part okay so for
02:00 - that I will not check that
02:03 - checkbox and if you want to create a new
02:06 - reposit a new folder you want to create
02:09 - for this project then you can go ahead
02:12 - uh let me just create one more new
02:15 - folder so that we can manage this
02:18 - project because we required this project
02:19 - for the next upcoming videos also I am
02:22 - going to create one new folder in my
02:23 - desktop name as
02:26 - my
02:27 - first
02:32 - web
02:33 - app
02:36 - okay so this is my folder name I'm
02:38 - creating okay inside which
02:42 - I am going to create my project okay uh
02:45 - jdk is you select whatever jdk you have
02:48 - in your PC uh if you don't have go ahead
02:51 - and download the jdk and or else you if
02:54 - you have you just you can add add your
02:56 - jdk also and catalog Let It Be internal
03:00 - uh don't default or Maven Central and
03:04 - now it most important part is Arch type
03:06 - you have to select the arch type right
03:08 - so you just go get into this drop down
03:12 - list and select the maven archetype web
03:15 - app because we are trying to create a
03:17 - web app right web application so for
03:20 - that we have we will be creating an arch
03:22 - type of web app and after that version
03:25 - Let It Be One
03:27 - no more uh
03:29 - Edition we have to do additional
03:31 - properties not required okay just go
03:34 - ahead and create the project
03:36 - okay for for let the intelligent idea
03:39 - sync the project and download the
03:42 - required files and generate the project
03:44 - okay so it is generating the project
03:46 - once you see the success message of
03:49 - build success in your console your
03:52 - project is successfully created right
03:55 - now uh you do one thing now you have
04:00 - created this web application right so I
04:03 - will tell you the structure of this web
04:06 - application okay so now for the first
04:10 - time you see in our previous video for
04:13 - the multi module the structure uh is not
04:15 - looking like this there are different
04:17 - structure defined for each type of arch
04:19 - type that you have selected okay so we
04:21 - have selected web app type of web app so
04:24 - for the web app this structure is
04:26 - followed okay so you have Source folder
04:28 - main folder under which resources and
04:31 - web app folder is there and under web
04:32 - app folder web IMF and under web INF
04:36 - index.jsp and web
04:38 - web.xml folder is there and inside
04:41 - web.xml uh it is an XML file and the
04:45 - display name is display name tag is
04:46 - there and answered with Arch type
04:48 - created web application so it is
04:51 - defining or it is telling that we have
04:53 - used our type of web application and
04:57 - and inside our index.jsp we have HTML
05:01 - tag body tag and inside body tag hello
05:04 - world and you can modify this hello
05:06 - world uh with whatever you want uh you
05:09 - you can go ahead and write your name as
05:11 - hello world
05:13 - welcome to
05:16 - programming
05:20 - okay
05:21 - so
05:23 - here's the thing that you can edit it is
05:27 - a it is HTML you can add more tags like
05:31 - H1 tag is also there in HTML I hope you
05:34 - remember and okay so H1 tag and we'll
05:38 - write uh
05:40 - your name
05:43 - whatever you want to write over here you
05:45 - can write and you can modify this
05:48 - index.jsp file and this index.js JSP
05:51 - file will get executed once we deploy
05:53 - this web app on any server uh we will be
05:57 - deploying this and we will be creating
05:59 - the war file also for this project in
06:01 - our upcoming videos for this video uh I
06:05 - hope you understand how we can create a
06:07 - web application in Maven okay and so let
06:11 - me just quickly go inside my palm.xml
06:14 - file and
06:16 - I will tell you what are the what are
06:18 - the difference between this
06:21 - this and our normal Maven project okay
06:23 - so you can see when I create the this
06:27 - project using the archetype as web app
06:29 - this dependency is automatically
06:31 - inserted by the IntelliJ IDEA okay
06:34 - or to be more precise it's by Maven okay
06:37 - so Maven has addressed dependency to the
06:41 - junit automatically when we create but
06:43 - when we create the normal Maven project
06:45 - there is no dependency tag over there
06:47 - you have to go and use the dependencies
06:49 - that you are required this is the one
06:51 - difference between that and one more
06:54 - difference packaging type is also added
06:56 - as War we'll discuss what is war
06:58 - packaging type in upcoming videos okay
07:01 - and version uh other thing is pretty
07:05 - much simple and
07:07 - okay so let's go and
07:10 - go inside our Maven uh Tab and inside of
07:13 - this and life cycle we will try to
07:15 - create the package of this okay so uh
07:19 - double click on the package
07:22 - yeah now most of you will get this error
07:26 - okay cannot access default fields of
07:29 - properties okay so most of you might get
07:33 - this error how to rectify this error I
07:36 - will tell you that first of all let me
07:38 - go and open my one
07:42 - previous project where the code to
07:45 - rectify this error is there okay so I'm
07:48 - going to inside my desktop I will go
07:51 - desktop demo web application
07:55 - demo web app let me go and click OK I
07:59 - will open this in a new window this is a
08:01 - demo web application that I have created
08:03 - previously so you go here and
08:08 - plugin management
08:10 - okay so these this type of cannot access
08:15 - the default fields of properties is a
08:17 - error come because we have not added the
08:21 - plugins inside our build
08:23 - and that plugins we have to add
08:26 - over here and if you add this plugin
08:30 - manual then go ahead and again click on
08:32 - package by this time it will run
08:36 - smoothly and you can see build success
08:39 - our build is got created and Target
08:42 - folder is also got created and this war
08:46 - file is also created by running our
08:50 - package command Okay so
08:53 - so that's it for this video I hope you
08:57 - got the idea how we can create a web
08:59 - application using Maven uh okay and in
09:04 - our upcoming video we will be deploying
09:06 - this web app in an Apache Tomcat server
09:10 - and we'll see how we can deploy it and
09:13 - how to manage that application web
09:16 - application on the Apache Tomcat server
09:19 - we will see that one as well so thank
09:22 - you guys for watching this video and I
09:24 - will see you in the next one
