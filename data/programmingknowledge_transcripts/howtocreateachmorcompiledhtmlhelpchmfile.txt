00:01 - hello guys in this video I will show you
00:03 - how to create a chm file so the first
00:07 - question comes into mind is what is a
00:10 - chm file so uh the file you are seeing
00:14 - on your screen is a chm file and it's a
00:20 - collection of HTML file which are
00:23 - compiled together and these chm file are
00:26 - generally used as a help for different
00:31 - software or uh some of the books are
00:35 - also published as chm file online so chm
00:41 - file you can use to create a help uh
00:45 - deex of uh your software or you can
00:48 - create a book online or which you can
00:52 - publish
00:53 - online so um generally if you uh search
01:00 - uh for chm in your search uh box so I
01:04 - will write chm you can f find at least
01:08 - one or two chm file in your system if
01:12 - you have some softwares so for example I
01:16 - have this user manual I open it and it's
01:21 - for Oracle virtual box so it's
01:25 - a US user manual for this software so
01:30 - you can
01:31 - create uh user manual help provider or
01:35 - books with this um so software or with
01:39 - this chm
01:41 - file so uh let's get started and I will
01:44 - show you how to uh create a chm file and
01:48 - how you can find chm file generally if
01:52 - you have uh windows and if you have uh
01:56 - this Visual Studio installed in your
01:59 - system
02:00 - you will find when you go to the search
02:03 - option and here you
02:07 - write
02:11 - help
02:13 - or
02:15 - HTML help
02:18 - Workshop so generally you can find this
02:22 - uh software on your system by default
02:26 - and if not we can find it on online
02:30 - just go to your browser and just write
02:34 - HTML
02:38 - help
02:40 - Workshop okay and this HTML help
02:44 - Workshop is a Microsoft uh softwares so
02:49 - just go there first link and you can
02:53 - just download this uh HTML Workshop from

03:00 - click the first option and click next
03:02 - and you will download this exe file and
03:06 - this file you can install very easily on
03:09 - your system so once if you you have
03:13 - installed this uh HTML help work work uh
03:17 - shop on your system then I will open
03:22 - it HTML
03:24 - workshop and it will open like this
03:28 - here so so what you can do is you can
03:32 - create a new project we are going to uh
03:35 - see how we can create a simple chm file
03:40 - so I will go to help new and I will
03:45 - select project and click
03:47 - okay and I will click next and here I
03:51 - will give uh the title of my chm file so
03:55 - for example I will write my chm file as
04:02 - user manual and I will select the folder
04:06 - in which I want
04:08 - to uh save this chm file so for example
04:12 - I have already folder made so I will
04:16 - give the path of that folder and press
04:19 - enter and I will click okay open
04:31 - but first of all we will give the name
04:33 - of this file so I'll
04:36 - write use
04:39 - um manual once again and click open and
04:44 - click
04:46 - next and if you have already uh made
04:50 - your HTML file because chm file is a
04:53 - collection of HTML file so if you have
04:56 - already uh made HTML help files then you
05:00 - can just select it and then just add it
05:04 - from here so you can add your previously
05:06 - made HTML file but I don't have
05:10 - previously made HTML right now so I will
05:13 - just leave these blank and click next
05:18 - and click
05:19 - finish so now I have uh this pro project
05:23 - made and then I will make some HTML
05:28 - files for example
05:30 - so I will go to file new and now I will
05:34 - make a HTML file for my table
05:40 - and let's see what can be the title
05:44 - let's look
05:45 - here in
05:48 - our HTML file
05:52 - so let's say we want to give the name of
05:56 - the first HTML file as
06:00 - about okay and click okay so this is the
06:05 - HTML file make and here you
06:09 - can give the HTML code so that you can
06:14 - have your HTML file for example I will
06:18 - provide a paragraph
06:28 - here and I will say
06:33 - my first chm
06:39 - file and then I will save this file so I
06:44 - will go to file once again and save file
06:47 - as and I will
06:49 - say because it's my about file so I will
06:52 - name it as
06:54 - about and save it in the same
06:57 - folder and in the same way I can make
07:01 - some new file new HTML file once again
07:05 - this file I want to name it
07:10 - as content for example okay and once
07:15 - again I can give any HTML uh code here
07:23 - so let's
07:25 - see what HTML code we can
07:30 - give here so we we are going to give a
07:32 - paragraph here and let's say this is
07:38 - uh content file okay and you can provide
07:43 - a list of content file you just need to
07:46 - know little basics of
07:48 - HTML this file also I will save as and
07:53 - this is
07:54 - my content file okay so right now I have
07:58 - two files to HTML file made then what I
08:02 - will do is I will go to here project and
08:07 - I will click this
08:10 - button and here I can give a title to my
08:14 - project and I can choose the default
08:17 - file so default file is the first file
08:20 - uh which it will
08:24 - open
08:25 - okay so
08:31 - for now I will close this and let's
08:34 - create a content of this chm file first
08:38 - so I will click on content Tab and I
08:41 - will say create a new content file
08:46 - okay and here I will
08:49 - say this is
08:53 - my about content file okay so because
08:57 - the first HTML file we made is for the
09:00 - about so content we can give the topic
09:04 - as about and it has extension.
09:08 - HSC and I will save
09:10 - it and now my content is

10:47 - index Tab and it will show a dialogue
10:51 - box and you will click
10:53 - okay and index I will leave this
10:58 - index default and I will save it and now
11:01 - my index is also made so once you are
11:05 - done with your content and index you can
11:09 - add some more files and uh help de
11:14 - whatever you want once you are done with
11:17 - that you go to file and you save all the
11:22 - files before compiling it and once again
11:25 - you go to file and click compile

11:32 - button also and now you can
11:37 - browse the folder in which you want to
11:39 - create
11:41 - this file so I will choose the same file
11:46 - in which I have created the other files
11:48 - so I will click open and I will give the
11:52 - name of my file so that
11:55 - was
11:58 - user manual for example
12:01 - YouTube and I will open it and you can
