00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part five of our PHP
00:05 - REST API tutorial and in this video guys
00:08 - we're going to continue working on with
00:10 - our PHP REST API project and also
00:13 - testing our project so far so I took the
00:17 - liberty of just populating the post
00:21 - table here so you can go ahead and try
00:24 - to download the my SQL file in the
00:28 - description box below to save you some
00:31 - time of adding all this unnecessary or I
00:35 - mean adding all this record store
00:37 - database so let's go back to our code
00:39 - editor and let's try to check our
00:42 - project for the last time before we test
00:45 - it in our postman software so we have
00:49 - here the read dot PHP file and we have
00:52 - the headers and we initialize our API by
00:57 - using the initialize that PHP file and
00:59 - of course this initialize that PHP file
01:02 - include all the core files or core files
01:08 - of our project and then and here we have
01:12 - associated the post okay and passing in
01:17 - the database connection and of course in
01:21 - here we have iterated the records coming
01:26 - from our database and displaying it or
01:30 - converting it to JSON format so now
01:33 - let's try to test this on our postman
01:37 - software so let's go ahead and search
01:40 - for postman and by the way guys this is
01:44 - the software that we're going to use to
01:46 - test or PHP API and if you have like if
01:52 - you have work in the future that
01:54 - involves API you can use postman to
01:57 - configure your request so this is the
02:02 - postman a postman software that we're
02:06 - going to use this is good for testing an
02:09 - API so let's just try to
02:13 - navigate to our projects of local host
02:16 - PHP arrests and then I think we're using
02:22 - HP press and of course API and then our
02:28 - read that page B so PHP RS API and then
02:32 - read that page B and then make sure that
02:35 - it is the the method that we're using is
02:38 - get and then try to send it or PHP API
02:43 - so we have here the I think we have some
02:49 - error here so let's try to read it in
02:54 - our yeah so we have an error in our SQL
03:00 - syntax check the manual and I think we
03:04 - don't have space here so let's try to do
03:09 - that navigate or post that PHP on line
03:13 - 39 so post that PHP and 939 so where is
03:20 - it
03:21 - ordered by oh so I think we have
03:27 - misspelled or ordered by instead of
03:31 - using ordered it should be order by okay
03:35 - so save this and let's go back to
03:38 - postman and send our request so we have
03:44 - a new error column not found we created
03:48 - in order Clause so that's easy because
03:53 - rated at should be created at so there
03:57 - you go same and we have now the result
04:03 - of our PHP REST API reading and under
04:09 - data we can see all the records coming
04:13 - from our database so as you can see the
04:16 - result of our request is on JSON format
04:22 - okay so now that we have read that PHP
04:26 - to get
04:27 - all the information or to get all the
04:29 - records from our database so what we
04:33 - want next is to create another read for
04:38 - a single record from our database so so
04:41 - for example we want to specify a certain
04:45 - ID of a post and then we should be able
04:48 - to get all the information associated by
04:51 - that particular ID so let's go back to
04:53 - our code editor and in our post that PHP
04:59 - file so right below the public function
05:03 - read and make sure you're still under or
05:07 - inside the post class so in here I'm
05:13 - just going to add another function so
05:16 - public and then function read underscore
05:21 - single so this will be just getting a
05:25 - single post from our database so as for
05:29 - the query so we're just going to almost
05:32 - we're going to use almost the same query
05:35 - and then we're just going to change
05:38 - something here instead of using order by
05:43 - so we should remove this because we're
05:46 - only getting a single post so there's no
05:49 - point of ordering it by the ID or
05:53 - created add attribute and of course you
05:59 - want to get a single pause so we need to
06:06 - specify that it should be a particular
06:12 - ID and of course we need to limit the
06:15 - return of this query into one because
06:20 - yes we only want to have a single post
06:24 - to be returned and in here we need to
06:29 - prepare also the statement for this
06:33 - particular function so that's prepared
06:37 - statement
06:39 - and in our statement here below you need
06:44 - to get the actual data coming from our
06:48 - database so statement and then fetch and
06:56 - then video fetch fetch associative array
07:06 - so and then below here we need to set
07:09 - the properties of our post so this title
07:17 - will be our row and then of course the
07:22 - return title from our query and then
07:25 - we're going to copy this one two three
07:29 - four okay
07:31 - it should be for our body
07:35 - this one is our author okay and then we
07:43 - also have the category ID category
07:47 - underscore ID so copy and paste it here
07:49 - and then category name gory name okay so
08:02 - here we go and we need to bind a
08:07 - parameter for this particular statement
08:11 - here so we're post ID equals so instead
08:17 - of executing it directly we need to bind
08:26 - a firearm so that's buying parameter and
08:31 - then we're just going to specify the
08:33 - first one and ID's should be the post ID
08:41 - okay and of course this is finding the
08:46 - bottom right and the next one is
08:49 - executing the
08:50 - [Music]
08:52 - execute the query so that's STM T and
08:59 - then execute
09:01 - okay so stmd execute and then Rho is the
09:11 - MD fetch video fetch assault or
09:14 - associate or associative array so I
09:17 - think that's it for our public function
09:21 - read underscore single and under our API
09:25 - let's just create a new file here so
09:30 - that's new file and then read single
09:37 - that PHP what happened there so read
09:45 - single dot PHP and then we're just going
09:48 - to copy here there read that big
09:54 - file and we're just going to delete the
09:58 - content of this below only the header so
10:04 - we're just going to use the same headers
10:06 - access control and of course the content
10:09 - type then we initialize our file and
10:12 - then instantiate a post object and we
10:21 - need to assign the post ID so that's
10:29 - post and then ID equals we're just
10:38 - tracking if the get ID is set so return
10:49 - the get ID
10:55 - otherwise exit or die
11:00 - and then both read single so that's the
11:08 - function that we have defined in our
11:11 - read that PHP file and of course we want
11:15 - to create an array of our values so that
11:19 - will be post post just like what we have
11:25 - in our read dot PHP so array and then of
11:33 - course we need to specify also the ID
11:36 - okay
11:38 - so post ID we're just going to copy this
11:46 - six title of our post the body of our
11:53 - prose and of course the author of the
11:58 - post category ID okay and then category
12:06 - your name so we're just going to copy
12:10 - this title for this so this one and also
12:16 - this one you know so this one and so
12:21 - with this one and we need to make make a
12:27 - JSON okay and print our and of course
12:35 - JSON encode the post array so post array
12:45 - so I think that's it and we can use this
12:47 - in our post months off there so let's go
12:50 - ahead and let's try that so I'm just
12:53 - going to copy this and create a new
12:55 - request so this should be API and then
13:00 - read underscore single dot PHP and then
13:04 - specify the ID say for example I need
13:07 - three
13:09 - okay so we have an error so let's try to
13:15 - so we have an error here because we
13:18 - misspelled the fetch so post fetch okay
13:29 - so let's go back to postman and send
13:33 - category name ID you find property post
13:39 - single single category name ID okay save
13:49 - and again so that's it we now have the
13:56 - post three with all the information
13:58 - coming from our database so you try to
14:01 - go with another one ID too so we can get
14:06 - all the information associated with ID
14:09 - number two so I think it is a good point
14:13 - to end our video and in the next video
14:16 - we're going to discuss how to create a
14:19 - new record by using our API so see you
14:23 - in the next video thanks for watching
