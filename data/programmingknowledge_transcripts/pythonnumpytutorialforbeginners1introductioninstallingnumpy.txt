00:00 - hey guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - numpy tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video I'm going to give you a brief
00:06 - introduction about
00:08 - numpy so first of all what is numpy so
00:12 - numpy is the fundamental package needed
00:15 - for scientific computing with python it
00:19 - is an open source library which contains
00:21 - a powerful and dimensional array object
00:25 - which we will see in the later videos
00:28 - and it also contains basic linear
00:31 - algebra functions basic Fourier
00:34 - transform functions sophisticated random
00:37 - number capabilities and also this
00:40 - library contains tools for integrating
00:43 - with the languages like C and C++ code
00:47 - now this library also contains advanced
00:50 - array slicing methods to select array
00:54 - elements and it also have several
00:57 - convenient array reshaping methods so in
01:01 - other words we can say that numpy is a
01:04 - Python library for array oriented
01:08 - computing besides it's obvious
01:10 - scientific uses numpy can also be used
01:14 - as an efficient multi-dimensional
01:17 - container for generic data now as I said
01:21 - numpy has a powerful N dimensional array
01:25 - object this object is an N dimensional
01:29 - array of homogeneous data types with
01:33 - many operations being performed in
01:35 - compiled code for performance so this
01:39 - library gives better performance when
01:42 - you use it with array oriented computing
01:46 - now there are several important
01:48 - differences between numpy arrays and the
01:51 - Python standard sequences like lists or
01:56 - tuples which we are going to see in the
01:58 - next video
01:59 - also number arrays have a fixed size
02:03 - modifying the size means creating a new
02:07 - array in numpy additionally numpy arrays
02:10 - must be of the same
02:13 - datatype but this can include Python
02:16 - object also now the next question you
02:19 - may ask is numpy is suited for what kind
02:22 - of applications so numpy can be used for
02:26 - many applications including image
02:29 - processing signal processing linear
02:31 - algebra and multiple other functionality
02:36 - is included in numpy so it can be used
02:40 - for several other functionalities so it
02:43 - is also said that numpy is the
02:46 - foundation of the Python scientific
02:49 - stick now you may also ask why do we
02:52 - need numpy so we already have sequences
02:57 - in Python such as lists or tuples or
03:01 - many other sequences to handle data with
03:05 - the standard Python library so why do we
03:08 - actually need an umpire so the answer is
03:11 - Python does numerical computations
03:14 - slowly in comparison to numpy so
03:18 - whenever you want to do matrix
03:21 - computation for example you have a
03:24 - matrix of thousand Cross thousand and
03:28 - you want to multiply this matrix then
03:32 - python triple loop takes more than ten
03:36 - minutes
03:36 - in comparison to numpy which only takes
03:39 - around 0.3 seconds so whenever you want
03:44 - to do matrix computation or n
03:47 - dimensional array computation numpy
03:50 - library is more efficient than even the
03:54 - Python standard library and that's why
03:57 - it is used so this was a brief
04:00 - introduction about numpy now how can be
04:04 - installed numpy on our Windows operating
04:08 - system or Mac operating system or Linux
04:11 - operating system so right now I am
04:13 - working on a Windows operating system
04:16 - but the procedure for installing numpy
04:19 - will be the same for Mac or Linux
04:22 - operating system so the basic thing
04:25 - which you need to install now
04:27 - by library is PIP so if you have PIP
04:32 - then you will be able to easily install
04:34 - numpy now on Windows whenever you have
04:39 - installed Python on your Windows
04:41 - operating system pip was already
04:44 - installed on your Windows operating
04:45 - system with the installation of Python
04:48 - on other operating systems like Mac and
04:51 - Linux you can install pip and then
04:54 - install numpy using pip now those of you
04:58 - who don't know what is pip pip is a
05:01 - package management system which is used
05:04 - to install and manage software packages
05:08 - written in Python so let's install
05:11 - number using pip
05:12 - so I'm going to give this command pip
05:15 - and then install and then whatever
05:18 - package you want to install so for
05:20 - example I want to install numpy so I
05:23 - will right number here so pip install
05:25 - numpy and then press Enter which is
05:27 - going to install numpy on my Windows
05:31 - operating system so now you can see the
05:34 - process of installing of numpy library
05:36 - is started by pip so you can see now
05:40 - numpy is installed on my Windows
05:43 - operating system so now I can just go
05:46 - into the Python interpreter so I will
05:49 - just write Python and then press Enter
05:52 - which will allow me to use the numpy
05:56 - library so I'm going to just write
05:59 - import numpy as NP and then press Enter
06:05 - which is going to give me no error if
06:09 - you give this command on your Python
06:12 - interpreter without installing numpy
06:14 - this import is going to give you some
06:18 - kind of error now let me give you a very
06:22 - basic example of converting a normal
06:27 - list into a number I array so let me
06:31 - just create a normal list I'm going to
06:35 - name it as n list which stands for
06:38 - normal list and
06:40 - I'm going to assign some value to this
06:43 - list so let's add some values here let's
06:47 - say 1 2 3 4 5 & 6 so there are 6
06:53 - elements inside our list and then I'm
06:56 - going to press ENTER now in order to
06:59 - convert this list into the numpy array
07:02 - I'm going to just create one more
07:06 - variable I'm going to say it is a NP
07:10 - array and then I'm going to convert this
07:15 - list into an array so I'm going to use
07:18 - this NP keyboard dot array and then as
07:23 - an argument I'm going to pass my list
07:27 - into this array function so n list is
07:31 - the name of the list and then press
07:34 - Enter and now when I see the content of
07:38 - an array it's going to give me the
07:42 - number array now I can also use print
07:46 - method in order to print the content of
07:49 - NP array so let's do that and you can
07:54 - see it's going to print the content of
07:56 - numpy array now one thing to notice here
08:00 - is that these elements inside this array
08:05 - does not contain comma between these
08:09 - elements because it's a special array
08:13 - which is called ND array and num pies
08:16 - main object is the homogeneous
08:19 - multi-dimensional array called ND array
08:23 - and this is that kind of array so this
08:26 - was the very basic example of num by now
08:30 - if you have installed anaconda package
08:32 - on your Windows operating system or Mac
08:35 - operating system or Linux operating
08:37 - system you don't need a pip to install
08:40 - numpy you can directly import numpy
08:44 - inside your jupiter notebook or spider
08:47 - ide and start using it now if you want
08:52 - to use numpy
08:54 - on PyCharm let me show you how to use
08:57 - numpy on your PI charm IDE so this is
09:01 - the PyCharm IDE and here I have created
09:04 - a blank project which is called numpy
09:08 - samples now in order to add numpy to
09:12 - your project what you need to do is you
09:15 - need to just click on this file option
09:17 - on your PyCharm IDE and then you just
09:20 - need to go to the settings and once the
09:23 - settings window opens what you need to
09:26 - do is you need to go to the project
09:29 - colon whatever is the name of your
09:32 - project so go under project and whatever
09:35 - is the name of your project and then
09:38 - click on project interpreter so I have
09:42 - already clicked on this project
09:44 - interpreter and here you can see pip is
09:48 - there and setup tools is there so here
09:51 - on the right hand side you will see this
09:53 - plus symbol so you just need to click on
09:56 - this plus symbol and once you click on
09:59 - this plus symbol
10:00 - it's just search for numpy here so I'm
10:03 - going to search for numpy and then you
10:06 - will be able to see this numpy here and
10:09 - the version which will be installed on
10:12 - your PI chum IDE so on the right hand
10:16 - side you will see the description about
10:18 - numpy and whatever version which will be
10:22 - installed so at the time of making this
10:24 - video one point sixteen point zero will
10:27 - be available for pycharm so I'm going to
10:30 - just click on install package this is
10:32 - going to install the numpy package for
10:35 - this project on your pycharm ide and
10:38 - once you see this green bar here which
10:41 - says package numpy installed
10:43 - successfully you can close this window
10:46 - and then click OK here and now you can
10:50 - create a python file so let me create a
10:53 - very simple python file and inside this
10:57 - python file what I'm going to do is I'm
10:59 - going to just write import numpy as NP
11:04 - and then let's create a list so I'm
11:07 - going to name
11:08 - list as L is equal to let's add just two
11:13 - elements 1 comma 2 here and then in
11:16 - order to convert this list into a number
11:19 - list we just need to use NP dot array
11:24 - and then pass our list to this array
11:28 - function and then you will be able to
11:30 - print the content of NP array using the
11:34 - print function so I'm going to just
11:36 - write and P list inside the print
11:39 - function and let's run this script by
11:43 - just right clicking and just selecting
11:46 - the run whatever filename you have and
11:49 - you will be able to see the output here
11:52 - in that terminal below so this is how
11:55 - you can install numpy on your PyCharm
11:58 - ide so you can use pycharm IDE or
12:01 - anaconda distribution or even you can
12:04 - use your plain terminal in order to
12:08 - develop your numpy script in the next
12:12 - video we will see some more
12:15 - functionalities about numpy array so
12:18 - stay tuned and I will see you in the
12:22 - next video
