00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install Debian 9 on your
00:05 - VirtualBox so let's get started so first
00:08 - of all we are going to download the ISO
00:10 - file for db9 so for that you just need
00:14 - to search for Debian on your favorite
00:15 - browser and the first link which will
00:17 - appear here will be from Debian dodgy so
00:20 - we are going to click that link and here
00:22 - you will see so many links and the link
00:25 - which we want to click is this link
00:28 - which says CD forward slash USB ISO
00:31 - image ok so just click on that link or
00:34 - I'll just add /c d in front of your
00:39 - Debian dodgy URL now on this webpage you
00:43 - just need to click on this link it says
00:46 - download live image using HTTP FTP or
00:50 - BitTorrent and you can see the link here
00:53 - is CD 4 slash live right now here you
00:57 - have two options for downloading the ISO
01:00 - file one is this option which uses
01:04 - BitTorrent and the other is the normal
01:06 - option so we are going to choose a
01:07 - normal option and I'm going to just
01:09 - click on the amd64
01:11 - link here just scroll down a little so
01:15 - just click on this link which says
01:16 - Debian Live 9-point whatever version you
01:19 - see here AMD 64 - genome and this is
01:23 - around 2.2 gigabyte file so it will take
01:26 - some time to download so now once you
01:28 - have downloaded this ISO file we are
01:30 - ready to create the virtual machine on
01:33 - our VirtualBox so for that just click on
01:36 - new and then write your debian machine
01:40 - name and then just choose type Linux and
01:44 - version Debian 64-bit and then click
01:47 - Next here you can choose the memory I'm
01:50 - going to just increase it until this
01:53 - green a limit and then click Next here
01:55 - just leave everything as default which
01:57 - is creative virtual disk now and then we
02:01 - will choose the VDI option here click
02:02 - Next
02:03 - and then we will choose the dynamically
02:06 - allocated the option here and then click
02:08 - Next and here you can choose the
02:11 - location where you want to save
02:13 - you're a file and you can choose how
02:17 - much amount of storage you want to give
02:20 - to your Debian machine and then I'm
02:23 - going to click create which is going to
02:25 - create my Debian virtual machine but
02:27 - still we are not ready to start it
02:30 - because we haven't provided the part of
02:32 - ISO file here so for providing the part
02:35 - just select the Debian option here and
02:38 - then click on settings which will open
02:41 - the settings of this de bein machine and
02:43 - in the general settings you just need to
02:45 - go to advanced and here make this shared
02:49 - clipboard' bi-directional and
02:51 - drag-and-drop
02:52 - bi-directional and then we will go to
02:55 - the system here you can increase the
02:58 - number of processors for example by
03:00 - default VirtualBox will allocate one
03:03 - processor or one CPU for your machine
03:06 - you can increase it from here right now
03:08 - we will go to the display display looks
03:11 - fine to me so I'm not going to change
03:12 - anything here and then I will go to the
03:15 - storage here you need to give the
03:18 - location to your ISO file so just click
03:20 - on empty and the controller IDE and then
03:23 - click on this CD icon and then browse to
03:25 - the location where your Debian ISO file
03:27 - is downloaded and then select that file
03:29 - and then click open and then we will go
03:33 - to the networks option here and in
03:36 - adopter 1 you can choose this bridged
03:39 - adapter and in my case I can see this
03:42 - option Dell wireless but it can be
03:44 - different in your case so whatever is
03:47 - the default name in your case you just
03:50 - need to choose that and then click OK
03:52 - and once you have done the settings we
03:55 - are ready to start our machine so just
03:57 - click on the start button here and then
04:00 - you will see this window and here you
04:03 - need to choose the option which says
04:05 - graphical Debian installer you can go
04:09 - down or up using your arrow keys and
04:12 - then press ENTER and then the
04:14 - installation of Debian will start so
04:16 - first of all select the language I will
04:17 - choose English here and then continue
04:19 - then select your location wherever you
04:22 - are located if your location is not in
04:27 - list of countries then you can choose
04:29 - others and then continue and then you
04:33 - can choose the continent and then you
04:36 - can choose the country in which you are
04:38 - living
04:39 - now you need to choose the locale so I'm
04:41 - going to leave this as default and
04:42 - continue and then you need to configure
04:45 - the keyboard so whatever keyboard layout
04:48 - you have you need to choose the keyboard
04:51 - layout from here so I'm going to choose
04:53 - the German keyboard layout because I
04:55 - have the German keyboard and then
04:57 - continue and here you just need to give
04:58 - the hostname for your machine so I'm
05:00 - going to just give Debian here and then
05:03 - click continue and then give the local
05:05 - domain I'm going to leave this as blank
05:07 - and then continue now on the next window
05:10 - you need to provide the root password so
05:12 - I'm going to give some root password
05:14 - here which you can remember and then
05:16 - continue and then create a new user so
05:21 - you need to give the full name of the
05:22 - new user I'm going to just write here
05:26 - they being nine and then continue and
05:29 - this will be the user name I'm going to
05:31 - just leave it as default and then
05:33 - continue and then you need to give the
05:36 - password for your new user so I'm going
05:40 - to give the password for the new user
05:42 - now and this password you need to
05:44 - remember in order to login with this
05:47 - user credentials and then click continue
05:50 - and now you will see this partition disk
05:52 - window so just leave this as default
05:54 - which is guided use entire disk and then
05:57 - continue and I'll leave everything as
05:59 - default and then click continue and then
06:01 - once again click continue and then on
06:04 - the next window just choose finish
06:05 - partitioning and write changes to disk
06:08 - and then continue and then write changes
06:11 - to disk you need to check this radio
06:14 - button which is yes and then continue
06:16 - now this step can take five to ten
06:17 - minutes so you need to wait for the
06:19 - installation to complete so now after
06:21 - some time I see this window which asked
06:23 - me use a network mirror so I'm going to
06:25 - just leave it as default which is yes
06:27 - and then click continue and here you
06:29 - need to choose the country which is
06:30 - nearer to your place and then continue
06:33 - and then choose the mirror which is
06:35 - nearer to you and then click continue
06:38 - HTTP proxy I'm going to leave
06:40 - as default click continue and now it's
06:42 - asking me to install a grub bootloader
06:44 - so I'm going to leave it as default
06:46 - which is yes and click continue and here
06:48 - I need to choose a forward slash there
06:51 - forward slash as the heir and now at the
06:53 - end I can see this message which says
06:56 - finish the installation so I'm going to
06:58 - click continue so now my Debian virtual
07:00 - machine has been rebooted now if you
07:03 - face this problem that at the rebooting
07:06 - step this Debian doesn't start then the
07:10 - simple solution is you can just power
07:12 - off the machine you can just click on
07:14 - this close button and then choose power
07:17 - off the machine and then click OK which
07:20 - is going to close the machine and then
07:22 - you can simply restart it by selecting
07:25 - your machine and then and then click on
07:27 - the start button from here and now we
07:29 - are going to login with our credential
07:31 - which we have set and now we can see
07:33 - that they benign desktop and when you
07:36 - click on activities you will see the
07:38 - side menu here and also from here you
07:41 - can search for anything so for example
07:43 - I'm going to search for terminal and I'm
07:48 - going to open the terminal
07:49 - so first of all we will check whether
07:52 - this Debian is resizing when we resize
07:55 - our virtual machine or not so it's not
07:58 - resizing that means we need to install
08:01 - the VirtualBox guest additions so for
08:04 - that we need to run some commands in the
08:07 - terminal so I'm going to just zoom in a
08:11 - little so you can see this command and
08:13 - I'm going to give these commands sudo
08:16 - apt - get update and sudo apt-get
08:22 - upgrade and then press Enter which is
08:25 - going to update and upgrade at the same
08:27 - time and here you need to give your TB
08:30 - and password which you have set at the
08:32 - time of the installation and now I can
08:34 - see this problem which says a user name
08:37 - is not in the sudoers file so don't
08:40 - worry it's a common problem and we will
08:42 - solve it so just give this command first
08:45 - of all sudo space hyphen or - and then
08:47 - press ENTER and then provide your root
08:49 - password which you have set at the time
08:52 - of installation so this is the root
08:53 - and not the new user password so just
08:56 - give that password and then press enter
08:58 - and then you will see this kind of
09:00 - command prompt with the hash in front of
09:03 - it before you can see you were seeing
09:06 - the dollar but when you log in as the
09:09 - root user you will see a hash in front
09:12 - of your command prompt and you will see
09:15 - the user is root now now in here you
09:17 - need to give this command VI sudo and
09:20 - then press Enter
09:21 - which is going to open the /e TC sudoers
09:24 - file and here you can add the sudo
09:28 - privilege for your user right so you can
09:31 - see your root has all the privileges and
09:34 - we will add the same privileges for the
09:38 - user which is currently logged in so you
09:40 - can just copy this and then go at the
09:44 - next line and you can see I am logged in
09:46 - with the Debian 9 user so I'm going to
09:49 - just first of all paste this line here
09:51 - and instead of root I'm going to just
09:55 - change it to Debian 9 so this is my user
09:59 - name and then I'm providing all the root
10:03 - privileges to this user and to save this
10:06 - you need to press ctrl o and then press
10:09 - Enter which is going to save your file
10:12 - and then you can just press control X to
10:15 - get out of this file okay so to verify
10:19 - I'm going to give this command once
10:21 - again VI sudo press Enter and you can
10:23 - see this Debian 9 user is there that
10:26 - means this user has now all the
10:29 - privileges so I'm going to come out of
10:31 - this file pressing ctrl X and now I'm
10:34 - going to exit from this user so I'm
10:37 - going to just right exit and then press
10:39 - ENTER and you can see once again debian
10:41 - 9 at the rate debian 9 is printed here
10:44 - with the dollar so first of all I'm
10:46 - going to clear the terminal and then I'm
10:49 - going to run this sudo apt-get update
10:51 - and sudo apt-get upgrade command once
10:54 - again and now I'm going to give my
10:56 - debian 9s user for password and you can
10:58 - see now it works here you just need to
11:01 - press Y and then press Enter
11:03 - so now the update and upgrade is
11:04 - completed let me clear
11:07 - the terminal once again and now I'm
11:09 - going to give this command su space -
11:12 - and then give my root password and then
11:16 - I'm going to paste this command this
11:19 - command and all the commands I'm going
11:20 - to give you in the description of this
11:22 - video so you can directly copy them and
11:24 - paste it into your terminal and now I'm
11:26 - going to press ENTER and now I'm going
11:28 - to give this command apt update and then
11:32 - press Enter
11:33 - and once the update is complete let me
11:35 - clear the terminal and now I'm going to
11:38 - give the last command which is this
11:41 - command which is going to install
11:42 - VirtualBox guest additions on your
11:45 - debian operating system so this command
11:48 - also I'm going to give you in the
11:50 - description and now I'm going to press
11:52 - ENTER and then press Y and then press
11:55 - Enter and once this command is finished
11:57 - we need to restart our system so I'm
11:59 - going to just close the terminal and and
12:04 - then click close terminal and then I'm
12:07 - going to power off the system so just
12:09 - click on this button and just click
12:12 - power off and once the machine is power
12:14 - off you need to restart it once again
12:16 - and now I'm going to login once again
12:21 - and now comes the moment of truth so we
12:26 - will try to resize our Debian operating
12:28 - system and you can see it's resizing
12:32 - according to the size of my windows host
12:34 - so this is working and let's see if the
12:38 - copy and paste is working or not so once
12:40 - again I'm going to just open the
12:43 - terminal and then I'm going to open the
12:48 - browser which is running on my Windows
12:50 - operating system and I'm going to copy
12:53 - this URL and then I'm going to try to
12:56 - paste this URL on the terminal on Debian
12:59 - and you can see it works so now the copy
13:03 - and paste feature is also working so in
13:06 - this way you can install Debian on your
13:08 - VirtualBox I hope you've enjoyed this

13:12 - bye for now
