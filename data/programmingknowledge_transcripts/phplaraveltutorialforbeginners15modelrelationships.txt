00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:02 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:04 - video so this is part 15 of our larval
00:08 - for beginners tutorial and in this video
00:11 - we're going to add or we're going to
00:13 - discuss the modal relationships so in
00:17 - the previous video we've worked with the
00:20 - user ID so where we added the user ID to
00:23 - our database and the I think it's from
00:29 - the post so we've added our user
00:33 - underscore ID by using the migration and
00:35 - in this video we're going to add the
00:40 - relationships relationship to this user
00:42 - ID to the actual users ID here in this
00:48 - table so that will enable us to only
00:51 - limit the blog's or the posts that are
00:54 - belonging to a certain user so so for
00:57 - example we're going to try to view the
01:00 - post so we all one or what we want is to
01:05 - only display the posts that are created
01:10 - by the logged in user in order for us to
01:15 - do that let's go back to our code editor
01:16 - and try to add the model in our models
01:24 - okay so let's open up our post modal so
01:30 - all we have to do here is to add a
01:33 - certain function so it is it is very
01:36 - simple to add relationships in laravel
01:38 - so as I've said all we have to do is add
01:42 - a function here so for example public
01:46 - function and then user and then return
01:51 - this and then belongs to the
02:00 - and then backslash user and the same
02:07 - thing with our user modal let's add a
02:13 - function here so public function and
02:18 - then post and then this should return
02:25 - has many relationship because a user can
02:32 - have many posts right so the user can
02:36 - post like thousands or hundreds of posts
02:42 - and let's go ahead open up our dashboard
02:50 - controller or home controller because
02:54 - that's where we were trying to display
02:58 - the post so in here we just need to get
03:01 - the user ID by using the oath and then
03:07 - user function and then supplying the ID
03:12 - or I think it's like that one instead of
03:18 - using it as parameter so user ID equals
03:22 - old and then user and then the ID
03:24 - attribute and then let's find the user
03:30 - fine and the user ID and then we need to
03:36 - pass in this user post into the home so
03:43 - that's squid and then close so it means
03:48 - that this post or this post are
03:51 - belonging to this political particular
03:54 - user supposed and comma and user
04:01 - post okay so if we go to the home home
04:12 - view so resources and then views and
04:17 - then home
04:18 - so after lagging in or after the user
04:23 - lag in so we need to display a table
04:29 - here that display or that will display
04:33 - all the posts belonging to the lag
04:35 - end-user
04:36 - so that's tabled and then class is table
04:42 - table stripe and then we're just going
04:47 - to define the headers or header for our
04:54 - table
04:55 - so that's eh
04:59 - and then I tell each and we're just
05:07 - going to add two other th here for our
05:11 - edit and delete button so th this is
05:16 - going to be just empty because this is
05:19 - going to be populated with ID or I'm in
05:23 - the edit and button edit and delete
05:29 - button so that's the H so in here I
05:34 - think you just need to check if the
05:39 - actual host at if and then count the
05:46 - post so if it is greater than 0 then we
05:51 - need to display the table right table
05:56 - and here we need to add the else and of
06:03 - course we need to say
06:07 - if the count of post is not greater than
06:12 - zero then we have to say you have no
06:16 - post no post and then and our if
06:25 - statement and if and of course in here
06:33 - we also need to populate the table rows
06:39 - so the title should be getting the title
06:44 - from the post
06:45 - so it's post and then the title
06:52 - of our post so there you go and then in
06:57 - here we just need to add the edit button
07:01 - first
07:02 - so a track and then the a track is post
07:10 - and then slash the post ID so that's
07:18 - basically post and then the ID and then
07:25 - we're just going to say slash Eddie and
07:29 - [Music]
07:32 - so just let's just add a class for this
07:35 - so class v TN v TN default before and
07:43 - then this should say it so let's try
07:47 - that refresh our page
07:51 - so let's go back to the home page
07:53 - refresh and then we need to log in so I
07:59 - think we forgot the user password
08:07 - let's try logging in so Tom Gmail
08:16 - that phone and then the password so log
08:20 - in we're just going to wait for a few
08:27 - seconds just to allow the log in so we
08:32 - have an error user not found in our home
08:36 - controller because I think we need to
08:38 - add that which one
08:43 - so home controller 27 home controller
08:47 - there you go so we need to add here the
08:51 - [Music]
08:53 - class so that's app and then backslash
08:59 - user okay let's try that save and
09:05 - refresh app user constant okay so I
09:15 - think we need to to remove the single
09:20 - code for that work and then refresh
09:27 - defined variable posts in home that laid
09:31 - that PHP so let's try to solve that home
09:38 - plain that PHP so it says here that we
09:44 - don't have access to the post for the
09:47 - actual post okay so I think we need to
09:52 - either it first in here to actually have
09:57 - the individual post so that's for each
10:00 - and then the post variable has single
10:06 - post and then let's just add the end of
10:11 - our for each here for each pair go
10:17 - so save and then refresh so we have here
10:24 - the new and updated view of our post so
10:29 - we can see the title which is post one
10:32 - post two and certain title of a post so
10:35 - let's try to add a new user so that in
10:40 - and then user 2 or make sure let's just
10:45 - say theme to solve and then team at
10:55 - gmail.com and then the password let's
10:58 - just apply a certain password okay and
11:03 - then register so as you can see the home
11:09 - or the location home it says you have no
11:13 - post because we just want the posts to
11:18 - show if the certain user lackin and then
11:23 - he has a or he has post so it should be
11:27 - displayed here but in case of our new
11:30 - user team so he has no posts or let's
11:34 - try to add a new post first post of team
11:39 - saw the body body of the post of teams
11:47 - so and then submit so this page displays
11:55 - all the post but if we try to go to the
11:59 - project application and then home it
12:03 - only displaced the first post or the
12:08 - single post out or a new user team saw
12:12 - so in the next video we're going to
12:15 - discuss how to actually have the access
12:18 - control for this because we don't want
12:21 - the guests to actually create post and
12:24 - we just want the user to actually see
12:29 - his own post
12:31 - see you in the next video thanks
