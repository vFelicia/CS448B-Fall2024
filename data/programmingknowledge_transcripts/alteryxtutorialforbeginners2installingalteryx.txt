00:00 - hello everyone welcome to this ultrix
00:03 - course in the previous video we have
00:05 - already seen the features of ultrix and
00:08 - how to actually install its setup
00:11 - so uh now as you can see the exe file is
00:14 - already downloaded
00:16 - i am just going to click on it to open
00:18 - it up and just work you out throughout
00:21 - this installation process
00:23 - right it is a very simple installation
00:25 - process so first of all what you need to
00:27 - do is you need to just go with the first
00:29 - option which is a typical ultrex version
00:33 - if you want
00:34 - our programming language based
00:36 - predictive tools which is an advanced
00:39 - version of alteryx you can go for it but
00:41 - since this course is aimed at beginners
00:44 - so we're just going with a typical
00:45 - version the language you can select i'm
00:47 - just going with english let's click on
00:49 - next
00:50 - then it is going to download all the
00:52 - required files so let's just wait for a
00:54 - few seconds till these files are
00:56 - downloaded
00:58 - now once all the required files are
01:01 - downloaded this kind of a menu
01:05 - will appear in front of you where it
01:07 - would
01:08 - be just verifying all the contents of
01:10 - the setup package so you need to wait
01:12 - for a few seconds
01:14 - let's just
01:15 - meet after this has been done
01:20 - now it will ask for uh
01:22 - where to install
01:24 - the application so you can just select a
01:27 - particular folder but i'm just going
01:29 - with the default path
01:30 - let's click on next
01:33 - accept the license agreement again click
01:35 - on next
01:36 - and then it's again gonna take a few
01:38 - seconds to install the whole program
01:40 - onto your system
01:43 - now once all the installation process
01:46 - has been completed you would be getting
01:48 - just a screen just like this make sure
01:51 - this box is checked on and click on
01:53 - finish
01:54 - now once this box is checked on ultrix
01:56 - would automatically be running onto your
01:58 - system
02:00 - now once the altrix application has been
02:03 - launched onto your system it would ask
02:05 - you to enter a license key
02:07 - if you have a license key you can just
02:09 - enter it or you can simply click on
02:11 - start free trial then it would ask your
02:14 - mail address and just remember this
02:16 - thing that this should be the same email
02:18 - address that you needed to provide once
02:21 - you were registering like when you were
02:24 - providing your details the email address
02:25 - you entered over there that's the same
02:28 - address that you need to provide over
02:29 - here so let's just enter this email
02:31 - address and click on continue
02:34 - now once you have entered your email
02:35 - address it would ask you whether you
02:38 - want to include the ultrix intelligence
02:40 - suite in your package or not
02:42 - so
02:44 - for now what we can do is just click on
02:46 - this i'll try it later option because i
02:48 - just don't want to use it right now
02:51 - and you can click on start solving so
02:53 - once you have done all these steps uh
02:55 - this kind of a dialog box would appear
02:57 - for the tour we can just click on closed
02:59 - tour because we don't need it
03:01 - right so
03:03 - this is how the ultrix user interface is
03:05 - looking
03:06 - let us take a quick look at all the
03:09 - operations that are going to be of use
03:11 - to us so first of all we have this menu
03:14 - bar with the usual options like file
03:16 - edit view and many more if you just
03:18 - hover over it
03:19 - you will find these different options
03:21 - right next we have is this tabs these
03:24 - are the different tabs having different
03:26 - functionalities like if you want some
03:30 - to add some of the tools then you can
03:32 - use these tabs like for data preparation
03:34 - for joining
03:35 - for parsing for transforming for the
03:38 - machine learning etc these different
03:40 - tools are available if you want to use
03:42 - any tools what you need to do is just go
03:43 - to its tab
03:45 - get that tool suppose i want to apply a
03:46 - filter just drag it and drop it over
03:49 - here this place where drop tools here is
03:52 - written it is known as a workflow or
03:54 - canvas so you can just drop that
03:55 - particular tool over here and then you
03:58 - would be able to use it now once you've
04:01 - dropped a tool you can see that
04:02 - something changed over here this is a
04:04 - configuration window which would help us
04:07 - to configure this tools like
04:10 - if you want to apply a filter what kind
04:11 - of a filter you want to apply the basic
04:13 - filter or a custom filter in a basic
04:15 - filter what changes you want to do so
04:17 - all these customizations or
04:18 - configurations can be done through this
04:20 - tab known as the configuration tab now
04:22 - once you have configured all the tools
04:25 - into the canvas you can click on this
04:27 - button that is known as the run button
04:29 - to actually run this workflow the
04:31 - shortcut is ctrl r so either you can use
04:33 - the shortcut or just the run button then
04:36 - what will happen is you would be getting
04:38 - a result or an output so this result
04:40 - would be shown over here in this window
04:42 - this is known as the results window this
04:44 - is where the output would be shown to
04:46 - you
04:47 - right next we have is the search part
04:50 - that is really important especially for
04:52 - the beginners like there are different
04:54 - tabs and the different tools are
04:56 - actually separated in those steps
04:59 - suppose you want to search for a
05:01 - particular tool like let's say you want
05:03 - to search for a formula so we can just
05:05 - simply type formula and you would see
05:08 - this formula is over here you can just
05:10 - use it like this you can just drag it
05:11 - and drop it over here like this okay so
05:14 - this search bar would be of very use
05:18 - to us
05:19 - next we have is this kind of a plus sign
05:21 - so if you want to add or remove some of
05:22 - the tools because there are many tools
05:24 - supported by ultrix not all are shown
05:26 - over here you want to add or remove them
05:28 - you can just simply use this option
05:30 - suppose i don't want this sdk example so
05:33 - let's just uncheck this
05:35 - and in case of that i want special
05:38 - analysis right so let's just check on
05:40 - spatial and click on ok
05:42 - so what would happen is as you can see
05:46 - the spatial has been added over here and
05:48 - the sdk analysis has been gone from here
05:51 - so this is how you can work with the
05:53 - simple interface of ultrix this is just
05:55 - the introduction part in the coming
05:57 - videos we would be seeing how to work
05:59 - with actual data sets through proper
06:01 - practicals that's all for this video
06:03 - thanks for watching
