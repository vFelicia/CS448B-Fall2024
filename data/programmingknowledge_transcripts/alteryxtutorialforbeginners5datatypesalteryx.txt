00:00 - in this video we are going to talk about
00:02 - the data types that are supported in
00:04 - ultrix
00:05 - so as we know that alteryx is a
00:07 - self-service data analytics tool
00:09 - it makes the process of etl easier
00:13 - and it is a super tool that combines the
00:15 - functionalities that are required for
00:17 - the steps of data preparation geospatial
00:20 - analysis and data science
00:22 - mainly to support all these
00:24 - functionalities alteryx
00:26 - uses these five data types
00:29 - these are the five data types that are
00:30 - supported in ultrix which are string
00:33 - data numeric data date and time data
00:35 - boolean data and spatial objects once
00:38 - the data is brought into ultrix the
00:40 - alterex data type is applied to the
00:42 - entire column and each value within that
00:45 - column
00:46 - alteryx tends to use the best suitable
00:48 - data type for the data coming from the
00:50 - databases or the structured files such
00:52 - as excel within the alteryx table
00:56 - now let us look at all of these data
00:58 - types in detail one by one
01:00 - so first of all we come to the string
01:02 - data type
01:03 - string data represents only text even if
01:06 - the data is numeric or spaces or special
01:08 - characters if a string consists of
01:10 - numbers it is ideally advised uh to
01:13 - first convert it to the numeric data
01:15 - type then you can just perform the
01:16 - calculations into it
01:18 - the string data is the one that is kept
01:21 - as it is
01:23 - it is further divided into these four
01:24 - categories that is string
01:26 - v string w string and v underscore
01:29 - string
01:30 - string and w string are a fixed length
01:33 - and you have to set the predefined
01:34 - length of the string so suppose you have
01:36 - set 8 to 100 characters then every time
01:38 - it would take a hundred characters
01:41 - um the w string can hold more
01:43 - international characters
01:45 - now we have v string and we underscore w
01:47 - string it stands for variable the v here
01:50 - stands for variable that means we cannot
01:52 - set any predefined length or we should
01:54 - not send
01:56 - any predefined length and it adjusts
01:58 - itself according to the length
02:00 - of the text of of the value that it is
02:03 - going to hold
02:05 - next we have is the numeric data type
02:07 - numeric alteryx data types
02:10 - are the ones that contains only the
02:12 - numbers
02:13 - it stores the numbers
02:15 - that could be represented by either a
02:17 - single digit or by multiple digits as
02:19 - well
02:20 - we have different combinations in this
02:22 - like byte integer
02:24 - fixed decimal float and double
02:27 - byte and integer are the whole numbers
02:29 - fixed decimal float and double include a
02:32 - decimal number as well
02:34 - byte is a small number then we have
02:36 - integer which has more significant
02:38 - numbers as you can see their range as
02:39 - well in the examples
02:42 - um then we have fixed decimal which is
02:44 - used for currency and float and double
02:48 - so this is fixed decimal which is used
02:49 - as a currency
02:51 - that's a numeric value with a decimal
02:54 - next we have the float and double which
02:56 - are used for more
02:57 - precise numbers
02:59 - float and code are not
03:00 - good because it comes to comparison they
03:03 - are never equal
03:05 - float is generally used to save the
03:07 - memory
03:09 - now the next data type we have is the
03:10 - date time data type
03:12 - uh in altrix the format of date
03:16 - time and date and time combined together
03:18 - are fixed
03:19 - so you will need to do some manipulation
03:21 - on your data if it is not in the format
03:24 - that you need
03:25 - as generalized by ultrex
03:28 - sometimes it is very difficult to work
03:30 - with date and time
03:31 - there is a tool known as the date time
03:33 - macro that converts the date and time in
03:36 - human readable as well as alteryx
03:38 - readable format
03:40 - so the format is as you can see for the
03:42 - date there is a 10 character string
03:44 - employing four characters for year
03:47 - two for month and two for date this is
03:49 - the general format that is supported by
03:51 - ultrix
03:52 - then we have time which is again an
03:54 - eight character string
03:56 - two characters for r2 for minutes and
03:58 - two for seconds and the examples have
04:01 - been shown on the right side of the
04:02 - screen
04:03 - next we have date and time combined
04:05 - which is a 19 character string
04:07 - employing four characters for the year
04:10 - two for the month two for the date and
04:12 - two each for the hours minutes and
04:13 - seconds
04:14 - and an example has been shown on the
04:16 - right side
04:18 - so these are the date and time data
04:20 - types that are supported in ultrix
04:22 - next we have is the boolean data type
04:26 - so the boolean
04:27 - basically represents a flag and it has
04:30 - only two possible values that is true
04:32 - and false so true means non-zero or one
04:36 - and false means zero
04:39 - or basically any other digit that is not
04:42 - zero can be considered as true
04:44 - boolean is used to basically
04:47 - characterize the objects categorize them
04:49 - into various categories or identify them
04:51 - whether the objects
04:53 - are a part of the particular category or
04:55 - not for example let's take a ah a
04:58 - student data set
04:59 - so
05:00 - in the student data set we can check
05:02 - that if the student has passed the test
05:05 - or not so we can just create or the data
05:08 - can have a column as passed it could
05:11 - have values true false or yes no
05:14 - so true false in that case would be
05:16 - represented using the boolean data types
05:21 - next we have is the spatial objects
05:23 - spatial objects are used for mapping
05:26 - and are associated with maintaining the
05:28 - data records
05:29 - a point a line polyline or polygon all
05:34 - comes out of spatial objects which can
05:36 - be used for mapping
05:38 - uh it is associated with the data record
05:41 - and
05:42 - they can be multiple spatial object
05:44 - fields in a table
05:46 - furthermore if you want to use any of
05:48 - the data like which is
05:51 - which cannot be represented in the
05:52 - format of a text like uh let's suppose
05:54 - an image or a video
05:56 - or an audio file then we use the spatial
05:59 - objects again
06:01 - so what happens is when you just
06:03 - import the
06:05 - table or any kind of an excel file
06:08 - then what happens is these spatial
06:10 - objects are
06:11 - automatically invoked actually there are
06:14 - two ways through which
06:16 - this alteryx
06:18 - imports this data types like how it uses
06:21 - these data types so let us take a look
06:22 - at them as well
06:24 - data in ultrix can be brought through
06:26 - these two fields or three
06:29 - through these two tools that is the auto
06:31 - field tool and the select tool now what
06:33 - is the difference between them auto
06:35 - field tool is used to select the data
06:37 - type automatically by alterix while the
06:39 - select tool
06:41 - helps the user to decide the data type
06:43 - so in case you are a user and you don't
06:45 - want an overhead of selecting the data
06:48 - day for altrix you can just go for the
06:50 - auto field tool
06:52 - so auto field tool is used to read
06:54 - through all of the records of an input
06:56 - and set the field type to the smallest
06:58 - possible size that is relative to the
07:01 - data contained in the column the tool
07:03 - correctly assigns a numeric field to a
07:06 - string data type where any record starts
07:08 - with 0 and not a number
07:11 - so in order to configure the tool we can
07:13 - just go to the select string fields to
07:15 - auto change field type
07:17 - and select the fields to auto configure
07:19 - them
07:20 - we can use either individually or all
07:22 - the fields at once as well
07:26 - next we have is the select tool so the
07:28 - select tool is used to include exclude
07:31 - and reorder the columns of data that
07:33 - pass through your workflow excluding the
07:35 - columns that can limit the data passing
07:37 - through a workflow and improve
07:39 - performance we can also use the select
07:41 - tool to modify the type and size of the
07:43 - data rename a column or add a
07:45 - description to it
07:47 - now there are other tools that include
07:49 - the select tool functionality such
07:51 - are append fields tool fine nearest tool
07:54 - join tool join multiple tool select db
07:56 - tool and spatial match tool
07:59 - we can use the table to modify the
08:00 - incoming data stream each row in the
08:02 - table represents a column in the data
08:05 - the field column in the table identifies
08:07 - the name of the column in the data and
08:09 - auto sizes to fit the column names
08:11 - without cutting off any text which is
08:13 - taken up to 40 characters
08:15 - so this is how the autofill tool and the
08:18 - select tool works
08:20 - in itrex now as we know that there are
08:22 - multiple tools in ultrix and each of
08:25 - them have a specific functionality in
08:28 - case you are interested in learning more
08:30 - about these tools then what you can do
08:32 - is refer to the official alteryx
08:35 - documentation now how to access it let
08:37 - me show you
08:38 - so in order to access it uh first of all
08:40 - i have opened up google and all you need
08:42 - to do is google alteryx help
08:46 - so once you uh google it the first link
08:48 - that comes up is the home page instead
08:50 - of going to the home page you can select
08:52 - on this documentation
08:54 - link so what would happen is the whole
08:57 - alteryx health documentation would be
09:00 - open in front of you now in case you
09:02 - want to learn about anything related to
09:03 - altrix you can refer to this
09:05 - documentation which is
09:06 - very much precise and clean
09:09 - in case you want to learn about these
09:10 - tools specific tools then you can refer
09:13 - to this um
09:14 - menu over here where all the tools are
09:17 - present and they are configured or they
09:19 - are
09:20 - grouped together like all these tools
09:23 - that are present in the in out tab are
09:24 - together grouped in this in out the
09:27 - tools that are present in the
09:28 - preparation tab are all present over
09:30 - here you can click on any of these links
09:32 - and that link would be opened here you
09:34 - would find the
09:36 - way through which you can use the tools
09:38 - how to use it how is it looking and how
09:41 - you can configure it
09:44 - then uh
09:45 - you can also see some examples that what
09:47 - would happen when this tool is being
09:49 - used what kind of output you would be
09:51 - think so these are
09:54 - the documentation that would help you to
09:55 - learn about all the tools in altrix but
09:58 - the common ones that are used and the
10:00 - most important ones we would be covering
10:02 - in this course so stay tuned for the
10:03 - next video that's all for this one
10:05 - thanks for watching
