00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will learn
00:06 - how we can use CD command in Linux CD
00:10 - command we can use to change the current
00:13 - working directory in Linux so let's see
00:16 - how we can use it so first of all I'm
00:19 - going to press control alt T to open my
00:23 - terminal and then I'm going to uh just
00:27 - use uh the command so so first of all
00:30 - let's see the syntax of a CD so you can
00:34 - just use CD as it is and it can be used
00:38 - with the directory name also so you can
00:41 - just write there here right so first of
00:46 - all whenever you give the CD command as
00:49 - it is it's going to uh land you in the
00:53 - current home directory right so you see
00:58 - it's the home whatever you open whenever
01:01 - you uh open the terminal for the first
01:03 - time it'll uh you know land you there
01:07 - right and then for example you want to
01:11 - uh go to somewhere for example we want
01:14 - to uh change directory to the root
01:17 - directory as we have seen in the first
01:20 - video root directory is this forward
01:22 - slash and then press enter and now we
01:25 - are in the root directory and you know
01:29 - you are in new root directory by this
01:31 - forward slash here and uh by default you
01:35 - have this still which is a home yeah
01:38 - right so first of all let's see in which
01:41 - directory we are so we are uh in root
01:45 - directory so we will just give PWD and
01:48 - see if we are in that directory or not
01:51 - so you can see we are in root directory
01:54 - right now once again if you give uh CD
01:57 - and then this uh till the symbol then
02:01 - this means your home directory home
02:04 - directory is nothing but your home slash
02:08 - username right so once again I give this
02:11 - command and then once again I give the
02:14 - PWD command and you can see we are in
02:18 - now our home directory right so This Ti
02:22 - can be used also with CD Command right
02:26 - now there is a command something like CD
02:31 - dot dot and it means we want to go to
02:35 - The Parent Directory of the current
02:38 - working directory so for example our
02:41 - current working directory is
02:44 - home/ programming knowledge which is my
02:47 - username so when I give a CD dot dot
02:51 - then we will go one folder above or
02:55 - parent of the current folder so I will
02:57 - just uh press enter and now you can see
03:01 - we are in the home uh folder so I will
03:04 - just once again give PWD and now we are
03:07 - in the home folder so we go one folder
03:11 - above
03:12 - right in a same way for example I will
03:17 - once again go to my uh home directory by
03:21 - CD till day and then for example I want
03:25 - to uh LS first let's see LS and what are
03:29 - the directories and documents in this
03:31 - folders so in uh my home directory we
03:34 - have a desktop or document folder or
03:38 - other folders right so to uh go inside
03:43 - those folder or to change the directory
03:45 - for example to the document folder you
03:47 - can just write CD and then document okay
03:52 - so just write CD document something like
03:54 - this and you will go to the documents
03:57 - folder once again I will go to my home
04:01 - folder by just uh give giving the CD
04:04 - command and then you can also go to the
04:08 - documents folder by just giving its
04:11 - absolute path so you can just give a CD
04:15 - home then my username which is
04:18 - programming knowledge and then the
04:20 - documents folder okay so you can either
04:24 - give the absolute path which is home uh
04:28 - username uh documents for example or you
04:31 - can give the relative path something
04:33 - like uh CD document this is the relative
04:37 - uh path right so we are already in the
04:41 - document so we will go home and then we
04:44 - can say CD uh documents and we will go
04:48 - to the documents folder right so you can
04:51 - give uh absolute path or the relative
04:54 - path relative path is nothing but so for
04:57 - example I do LS and uh whatever
05:01 - directory you see uh inside your present
05:04 - working directory you can just directly
05:07 - give the name of that directory so for
05:10 - example CD and then uh I can just uh
05:13 - give download this time and press enter
05:16 - and we are in the downloads right now
05:19 - the next command is going to the the
05:24 - directory inside the directory so for
05:27 - example uh let's go to our home and
05:30 - let's clear the screen for now and let's
05:34 - see what we have in our uh document
05:38 - folder so I will just go to the
05:40 - documents folder and I will just do LS
05:45 - and in here I have uh the two files but
05:50 - for example I will create one more
05:52 - folder here inside a documents folder so
05:55 - I will just go inside the documents
05:57 - folder and I will create a new folder
06:00 - for example I will say it's a book
06:03 - folder books folder okay and I want to
06:06 - go inside this folder so how I can do
06:10 - this I can just do CD which will change
06:13 - the directory to the home directory and
06:16 - I can just give uh the command CD
06:21 - documents and then books something like
06:24 - this so you can uh go in the books by
06:27 - giving this command and press enter and
06:30 - we are inside this boooks folder and
06:33 - then right now it has no files but for
06:37 - example I want to create a document I
06:39 - will say just uh test dot uh txt files
06:45 - right so txt file and I will just do LS
06:50 - and you see we have the txt file
06:54 - test.txt file now next command is for
06:58 - example I want to navigate inside this
07:02 - books folder and I will create one more
07:04 - folder there is a command to create uh
07:07 - directory by the way but uh this command
07:11 - we are going to see in the later videos
07:13 - that's why I'm not showing you this
07:15 - Command right now and I'm going to use
07:18 - this graphical view to create my folder
07:20 - so for example I will say this
07:24 - is my books folder okay and if You
07:28 - observe I I have left a space between my
07:32 - and books right and I left the space
07:36 - intentionally so when I do Lis here it
07:40 - will show me there is a folder called my
07:43 - books but if you uh create a folder or
07:47 - directory with my book for with a space
07:51 - then how you can navigate to this uh
07:54 - directory for example I will do my uh CD
07:58 - and then I will just
08:00 - uh you know write my books and press
08:02 - enter and it will give me the error
08:05 - because CD is just looking for the first
08:08 - uh you know argument after this CD
08:11 - command and if it's a space there are
08:13 - two arguments after this CD command so
08:17 - how you can go inside the folder which
08:20 - has space between it there are three
08:23 - options uh you can use to navigate such
08:26 - kind of folder first option is you can
08:29 - just WR CD and then do my and then you
08:33 - give this backs slash and then you give
08:36 - books for example something like this
08:39 - and when you press enter you will go
08:42 - inside this my books folder okay I will
08:46 - go once again one fold above and the
08:49 - second option is instead of uh using
08:52 - this uh back slash you can just write
08:56 - double quote and then you can just write
08:59 - my books okay and press enter and also
09:04 - you are in your my books folder right
09:07 - once again I will go back one folder
09:10 - ahead and the third option how you can
09:13 - uh go uh inside this folder of directory
09:17 - which has uh the space between it you
09:20 - can just give single quote around your
09:23 - uh directory name so press enter and
09:26 - also you are in the same directory okay
09:30 - so what are the command we have used
09:33 - today or we have learned today so I will
09:35 - just clear the terminal and I will once
09:39 - again tell you what are the commands we
09:41 - have learned so CD command if you give
09:44 - then you will go to your home directory
09:48 - okay so I will give CD and I'm in my
09:50 - home directory now in order to navigate
09:53 - to a particular directory I need to give
09:56 - its absolute path or relative path so
09:58 - for example I want to go to root I will
10:01 - just say uh cd/ root and I'm in the root
10:05 - folder once again I will go to my home
10:08 - folder and for example I want to go to
10:11 - CD user bin okay so I will give it
10:15 - absolute path and I'm in the CD user bin
10:18 - and I can just list out all the content
10:21 - of uh this folder by Lis which we have
10:24 - seen in the last video I will clear the
10:27 - terminal once again the the next command
10:30 - is the relative path so for example I
10:33 - will once again go to my home directory
10:36 - and I will just say CD and uh I want to
10:39 - navigate to documents so I can just uh
10:42 - give CD documents or if I want to go uh
10:46 - one folder inside this document I want
10:48 - to navigate to the books folder I can
10:51 - just give uh this uh type of uh you know
10:54 - command and PR press enter and we are in
10:57 - the books folder now we have created a
11:00 - folder with a space between its name
11:04 - then you can use a CD and then either
11:08 - you can use backwards slash between the
11:10 - space or you can enclose this name
11:14 - between double quotes or single quotes
11:17 - and you will be inside that directory
11:20 - and you can work with it so I hope you
