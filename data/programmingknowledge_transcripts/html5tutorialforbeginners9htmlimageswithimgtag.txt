00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:05 - in this video we will see how we can add
00:08 - an image to our HTML page using IMG and
00:13 - what are the various ways we can use IMG
00:18 - element in HTML so let's get started to
00:23 - add an image to your web page you need
00:26 - an element called IMG and this mainly
00:32 - has two attribute one is alt and other
00:36 - is source so art is just like a
00:39 - description for your image for example
00:42 - my sweet image and source is the
00:49 - location where your image is located so
00:52 - for the location let's create our folder
00:56 - inside of a web content folder so I'm
00:58 - going to create a folder and I'm going
01:00 - to name it as IMG and inside this IMG
01:05 - folder what I'm going to do is I have
01:07 - this image for HTML logo I'm going to
01:10 - drag and drop into this image folder
01:13 - right and just say copy file and click
01:17 - OK and it's going to place my image
01:20 - inside this image folder now to give the
01:24 - sauce part here I will just write IMG /
01:28 - my image name so HTML dot PNG right so
01:34 - the name of my PNG file right so I will
01:38 - save my code and refresh the webpage and
01:42 - I can see this HTML logo here on my web
01:45 - page right now there is one more
01:48 - attribute which we can use here is the
01:52 - size attribute right so you can give the
01:56 - width and height to your image something
01:59 - like this so there are two ways of
02:01 - giving width and height or to your image
02:04 - one is you just need to give width
02:07 - attribute and give the number of pixel
02:11 - you want for example 600 pixel as a
02:13 - it and same for height for example 600
02:17 - pixel for height okay save it and
02:20 - refresh the page and it will look like
02:23 - this okay
02:24 - the second way of giving the width and
02:28 - height is using style attributes so just
02:31 - to add a style attribute and then just
02:34 - add width here and as a width you just
02:38 - need to add 600 px and then semicolon
02:42 - and then the height and once again give
02:46 - 600px okay and it will result in the
02:50 - same way right so when you refresh the
02:52 - page it will be same because it was
02:56 - early a 600 pixel for example I do it
03:00 - something like 400 by 400 and save the
03:04 - page refresh it as going to become 400
03:09 - by 400 pixel image okay now you not only
03:14 - can use the local images you can also
03:18 - use the images which are on some server
03:23 - for example you have some image on some
03:27 - website and you have the URL of the
03:29 - image you can directly add as a source
03:32 - of your image in here so for example I
03:36 - will just give the source of the image
03:40 - which I have on my website and I will
03:43 - save it and I will refresh it and it's
03:46 - going to show this image which is on the
03:49 - website now let's see how we can add a
03:52 - image with a link okay so to add our
03:56 - image with a link what you can need to
03:59 - do is you need to add a normal link tag
04:03 - and inside this link tag you just need
04:06 - to place your image something like this
04:11 - okay so your image tag and as reference
04:17 - so H are EF you can give the location of
04:21 - the file which you want to you know
04:23 - redirect to so for example I want to
04:26 - redirect
04:27 - to this file to dot html' inside my
04:33 - directory folder I can just locate
04:36 - something like this dir and then the
04:39 - file name file - dot HTML and save it
04:47 - and refresh your webpage and once you
04:50 - click this image you will go to the page
04:53 - which you are linked to so the HTML page
04:57 - which you are you know targeting it will
05:01 - go there ok now let's see how we can add
05:04 - a background image to our HTML page so
05:08 - I'm going to remove all this and to add
05:12 - a background image there are two ways
05:14 - one is just give in your body give a
05:18 - attribute called back ground and give
05:22 - the location of the image which you want
05:24 - to set as background for example I want
05:27 - to set this image itself as a background
05:30 - so I just write I am G slash HTML dot
05:35 - PNG and save it and refresh your web
05:40 - page and it's going to set this image as
05:43 - a background and if this image is of
05:47 - smaller size then your you know web page
05:50 - size then it's going to repeat okay so
05:53 - it's going to repeat something like this
05:55 - to cover your web page okay the second
05:59 - way of adding this background image is
06:03 - using a style element so just add a
06:06 - style element and inside your style
06:09 - element you just need to write body and
06:12 - inside these curly braces you can add
06:15 - attribute called
06:17 - background image and as value you just
06:21 - need to give you are L and then inside
06:26 - the bracket you just need to give the
06:28 - location of your image so just copy the
06:31 - image from here and paste it here and
06:34 - I'm going to remove this attribute from
06:37 - here and save it and refresh your
06:40 - webpage
06:41 - and it will be the same okay now suppose
06:44 - if you don't want to repeat this image
06:47 - you just want to show it once what you
06:50 - can do you can just add our tribute
06:54 - called
06:55 - background repeat and as a value you can
07:00 - give no-repeat okay
07:03 - and save your work page and refresh it I
07:08 - was going to look like this so it's not
07:10 - going to repeat okay now suppose you
07:14 - want to use your image with a paragraph
07:18 - so for example I'm going to add a
07:20 - paragraph tag here and I'm going to add
07:23 - some random paragraph here and I will
07:27 - save it and refresh it and my paragraph
07:30 - looks like this so my image and below
07:33 - this my paragraph but for example I want
07:37 - to use this image beside a paragraph
07:40 - what I can do is I will just copy this
07:43 - image element and inside my paragraph
07:47 - tags I can add this image element inside
07:52 - the paragraph element right so just
07:55 - inside the paragraph element I will add
07:58 - it now when I save it and refresh it the
08:03 - paragraph will still remain on the
08:06 - bottom and not on the side of the image
08:09 - now to solve this problem what we can do
08:12 - is go to your image element and in here
08:16 - with the style you just need to add one
08:19 - more attribute called float and with
08:23 - float
08:23 - you can add float right of float left
08:27 - okay so for example for float right and
08:31 - save your code and refresh the page and
08:34 - now your image is on the right and your
08:38 - paragraph is on the left okay now if you
08:42 - do just opposite of this for example
08:46 - float left and save it and refresh your
08:51 - webpage now your image is on the
08:54 - left hand side and your paragraph is on
08:57 - the right hand side okay so in this way
09:00 - you can use image element in HTML I hope
