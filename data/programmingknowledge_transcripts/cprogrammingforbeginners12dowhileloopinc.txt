00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I've shown you how you can
00:05 - use Loops in C and I have shown you how
00:10 - you can use y Loop in C now in this
00:14 - video we are going to see how we can use
00:17 - do while loop which is uh one more kind
00:21 - of loop and what is the difference
00:24 - between do while loop and while loop
00:27 - okay so let's uh uh uh assume that we
00:32 - want to uh
00:34 - execute uh the number or integers from 0
00:38 - to 10 as we have done in the last video
00:41 - but this time we want to do it with the
00:44 - do while loop okay so this was the code
00:47 - we have written in the last video which
00:50 - I'm going to comment because uh later in
00:53 - the video we will see how or what is the
00:57 - difference between do while loop and
00:59 - while loop so let's see what is the
01:01 - syntax of do while loop first so you
01:05 - just write a keyword do and then gives
01:10 - give this semicolon and after this
01:12 - semicolon at the end of your curly
01:15 - braces uh this is not semicolon this is
01:17 - Curly braces sorry and at the end of
01:20 - your curly brace you just
01:23 - write
01:24 - while it should be while and then you
01:28 - give your condition
01:30 - okay so keyword do and then curly brace
01:35 - then while then your condition now once
01:39 - again for example we want to print uh
01:41 - values of integer from uh 0 to 10 I'm
01:46 - going to copy this code in here and it
01:50 - will print the value 0 to 10 and the
01:53 - condition will be same as earlier which
01:56 - is while I is less than or equal to 10
02:00 - okay and I will just compile this
02:03 - program and run the program and it
02:06 - prints the value 0 1 2 3 4 up to 10
02:09 - right and in here what's happening
02:12 - is first of all your uh I is equal to
02:17 - zero and it says do do means do
02:21 - something
02:23 - so before checking any condition your
02:27 - statement will be executed which is this
02:30 - one so it prints I is equal to 0 and
02:33 - then it increases I by 1 and now value
02:37 - of I is 1 Which is less than 10 right so
02:41 - it is it goes in the loop once again and
02:45 - it prints I is equal to 1 and in here it
02:48 - increases the value of I by 1 once again
02:51 - so I is equal to 2 this time then 2 is
02:54 - less than or equal to 10 which is true
02:58 - once again it will go in this Loop until
03:01 - I is equal to 10 now I is equal to 10
03:06 - this will be true and it this will be
03:10 - printed but now when the I value of I
03:15 - becomes 11 this is uh false this
03:19 - condition is false and as soon as this
03:21 - condition is false it goes out of the
03:24 - loop
03:25 - okay
03:27 - so what is the difference between
03:29 - between uh this do while loop and while
03:32 - loop the difference
03:35 - is while whenever we use y Loop it
03:40 - checks the condition first and then
03:43 - executes your code but in the do while
03:47 - loop it executes your code at least once
03:51 - and then checks your condition and if
03:54 - this condition is true it will once
03:57 - again go into the statement here and it
04:00 - will execute a statement and as soon as
04:04 - this statement is false it goes out of
04:06 - the loop okay so
04:10 - do uh loop or do while loop executes
04:14 - your code at least once without checking
04:17 - the condition but while loop checks the
04:22 - condition first and then executes the
04:25 - code
04:27 - now uh let's see what is the basic
04:30 - difference here so for example I will
04:33 - just give uh the separator or I will
04:36 - print some
04:38 - separator here so that we know
04:42 - that the code above the the the star
04:46 - line is for do while loop and code below
04:50 - the star line is for while loop
04:53 - right and I will compile this
04:58 - program
05:01 - and everything is fine it prints from 0
05:05 - to 10 which is
05:08 - okay and because value of I is the same
05:13 - here right so here value of I will be 10
05:16 - once again so what we are going to do is
05:20 - here we will
05:22 - take instead of I we will take variable
05:26 - J in y Loop so J here I will replace is
05:29 - J here and J value of J is equal to J
05:36 - j++
05:38 - right why I have done that because the
05:42 - value of otherwise the value of I will
05:44 - be same for this and this and we will
05:47 - never find the difference between the
05:50 - two Loops once again I will run the
05:54 - program and it
05:56 - prints this value I forgot J here so I
06:01 - must give J here also and once again I
06:05 - will compile the
06:07 - code and now you can see it prints
06:13 - the value of uh first of all I and then
06:18 - it prints the value of J okay so it
06:21 - starts from zero I will just make it
06:24 - bigger so that we can see all the values
06:27 - so the value of I starts from 0 up to 10
06:30 - and value of J starts from 0 up to 10 my
06:34 - battery is going so I must hurry up I
06:38 - think
06:40 - so right so value of I starts from 0 to
06:44 - 10 and the value of J starts from 0 to
06:47 - 10 now let's see the difference here now
06:51 - for example I will give some condition
06:54 - which is not true okay so for example
06:57 - I'm checking whether I I is greater than
07:02 - 10 which is not true because value of I
07:05 - is 0er 0 is not greater than 10 right
07:09 - and in this case also value of J is
07:12 - greater than 10 we are checking which is
07:16 - false because value of J is zero which
07:19 - is not greater than 10 J is not greater
07:22 - than 10 what happens here run the
07:26 - code and we see that value of I is equal
07:30 - to 0 which is it prints value of I is
07:36 - equal to 0 and then it increments the
07:39 - value of I by 1 so I becomes 1 1 is not
07:44 - greater than 10 so it goes out of the
07:46 - loop so what we have seen that do
07:51 - Loop performs your statement at least
07:55 - once and then checks the condition but
07:58 - in the case of while loop here J is
08:02 - equal to 0 0 is not greater than 10 so
08:06 - nothing is executed from this while loop
08:10 - okay so nothing is printed here so this
08:13 - is the difference between while loop and
08:15 - do while loop so always remember
08:17 - whenever you want to execute your code
08:20 - at least once use dowi Loop and whenever
08:25 - you want to uh check the condition first
08:28 - and then execute your code then use
08:31 - while loop so I hope you have uh
08:34 - understood the basic concept of do while
08:36 - loop and difference between do while
08:38 - loop and while loop and I hope uh you
08:41 - have enjoyed this video please write
08:42 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
