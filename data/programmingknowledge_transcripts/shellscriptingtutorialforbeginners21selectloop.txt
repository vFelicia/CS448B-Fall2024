00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in this video we will see how to use
00:06 - select loop in shell scripting now first
00:10 - of all why he use select loop so the
00:14 - select construct allows us to generate
00:17 - easy menus so whenever you need to write
00:21 - a script which requires some menus then
00:24 - you can use select loop now let's see
00:27 - the basic syntax of select loop so to
00:32 - use select you just need to write this
00:34 - select keyword and then you need to give
00:38 - any variable name and then this keyword
00:41 - in and then you can give a list of items
00:45 - here and then in do and done in between
00:49 - do and done keywords you can execute
00:52 - some command based upon the list you
00:56 - have provided so let's see actually how
01:00 - we use select loop so for example I have
01:04 - the list of some names so I'm going to
01:06 - declare a name variable here and the
01:10 - list can be some names so for example
01:13 - mark John Tom Ben and so on right so
01:22 - right now I'm just using four names and
01:24 - then I can just print those names like
01:30 - this so I can just write echo and then
01:35 - selected name is whatever is selected so
01:40 - dollar and the name which is this
01:44 - variable right and then we can write
01:49 - selected okay and I'm going to just save
01:52 - my script and I'm going to run this
01:56 - script and let's see what happens so I'm
01:58 - going to just press ENTER and you see
02:01 - here it gives us these list of names as
02:06 - a menu so every name is given and before
02:13 - every name
02:13 - we have a number provided to us right
02:18 - so whatever list you will give here it
02:21 - will be presented like this with a
02:23 - number before it in a sequence and then
02:26 - the prompt will ask you to give any
02:30 - number from this list so for example one
02:35 - is associated to mark two is associated
02:38 - to John three is associated to Tom and
02:41 - four is associated to Ben so when I
02:45 - write two and then press Enter it prints
02:50 - John selected right because we selected
02:53 - the second item which is associated to
02:55 - John right and this is the easy usage of
03:01 - the Select loop so select loop construct
03:05 - is similar to follow but what it does is
03:09 - first of all it iterate over the list
03:12 - and give you this kind of menu structure
03:15 - to us and then we can select any of the
03:19 - items from the menu and then execute
03:22 - some commands or statement based upon
03:26 - the selected value right now select loop
03:30 - is often used with the case statement so
03:36 - some kind of cases can be used with the
03:40 - Select loop and we will see how we can
03:43 - use it so what I'm going to do is first
03:46 - of all I'm going to give the basic
03:51 - structure of cases so case and e-s-a see
03:58 - right this is the basic construct and
04:01 - then we can add some you know cases here
04:05 - right so what we want to do here is we
04:09 - will just see what is the name provided
04:12 - so let's just use this dollar symbol and
04:15 - name variable and then in we already
04:19 - know what is the basic syntax of this
04:22 - case statement right and
04:25 - then we can just give names from this
04:30 - list so whenever mark is selected then
04:33 - we can print something right so just
04:36 - give this and then in this case what we
04:40 - can do is we can echo for example mark
04:44 - selected write something like this and
04:47 - then to end you can just give double
04:51 - semicolon like this okay so similarly we
04:55 - will just give multiple cases here for
05:00 - the four names
05:04 - and you can even provide the default
05:08 - case here so if you want to provide
05:12 - default case you can just write this
05:15 - kind of syntax as the default case right
05:20 - so in this case we will just echo and
05:23 - then we can just print error and we can
05:27 - also say please provide a number between
05:30 - one to four so we can just say please
05:32 - provide the number between one to four
05:38 - right so you can just write this in the
05:42 - case of any of the default cases which
05:45 - is not present in this case list and
05:49 - let's run the script once again so you
05:52 - can see whenever you you know select or
05:56 - give any number it's not going to you
06:00 - know exit out of this menu you can give
06:03 - multiple two times the number and it's
06:06 - going to once again ask you the number
06:08 - so in order to exit the script you just
06:10 - need to press ctrl C in order to exit
06:14 - out of this script right and then once
06:16 - again run the script and you have these
06:19 - numbers once again and then once again
06:22 - when I give one it says mark selected to
06:26 - John selected three Tom selected an for
06:32 - been selected right
06:34 - so this select loop is often used with
06:38 - this case statement I am just giving you
06:41 - this kind of echo statement here but you
06:45 - can execute any complex logic based upon
06:48 - the selected value from the Select loop
06:52 - ok so this is the basic usage of select
06:56 - loop in shell scripting I hope you've
