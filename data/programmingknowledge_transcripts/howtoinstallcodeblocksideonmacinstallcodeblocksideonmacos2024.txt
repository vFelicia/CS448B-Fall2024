00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install and
00:03 - use code blocks on your Mac operating
00:06 - system so let's get started and let's
00:08 - see how we can do it so the prerequisite
00:10 - of installing code blocks on your Mac
00:13 - operating system is that you need to
00:16 - either have the xcode developer tools
00:20 - installed or xcode itself installed on
00:24 - your Mac operating system so let me show
00:26 - you how you can install the X code so
00:29 - just
00:30 - open the app store by clicking on the
00:32 - App Store icon and then search for xcode
00:36 - here and you will be able to see the
00:39 - xcode uh result here which is xcode
00:43 - developer tools so in my case I have
00:47 - already installed it but I have already
00:49 - created a video how you can install
00:52 - xcode on your Mac operating system so I
00:55 - will put the link of that video in the
00:56 - description of this video so you can uh
00:59 - in install xcode on your Mac operating
01:03 - system if you don't know how to do that
01:05 - but this xcode will take around 7 to 8
01:09 - GB of space on your Mac operating system
01:12 - because it's going to uh install the
01:16 - excode developer tools including the
01:19 - tools which you might not require for
01:22 - example for C C++ development which you
01:26 - want to do using Code blocks right so if
01:29 - you don't have the space on your Mac
01:31 - operating system and you don't want to
01:33 - install xcode uh in a full package
01:38 - around 7 to 8 GB then you also have
01:41 - other option and the other option is to
01:45 - install xcode developer tools via the
01:49 - command line it's not going to take so
01:51 - much space on your computer but it's
01:53 - also going to work with your code blocks
01:57 - so xcode select space hyphen ien install
02:01 - is the command for that so if you don't
02:04 - want to install xcode developer tools
02:06 - from the app store then you can just run
02:10 - this command and this will work also so
02:12 - I'm going to just copy this command and
02:14 - then I'm going to uh click on the
02:18 - spotlight and then search for the
02:20 - terminal and then open the terminal and
02:23 - then paste this command here and then
02:25 - I'm going to press enter and in my case
02:28 - it says the command online tool are
02:30 - already installed right so I have
02:33 - already installed the full version of
02:35 - xcode and that's why it says that it's
02:39 - already installed in your case if xcode
02:42 - is not installed via app store this
02:45 - command will work so it's either or
02:49 - right either you can use this command or
02:51 - install xcode from the App Store once
02:54 - you have excode developer tools let's go
02:57 - to the browser so you can choose choose
03:00 - uh any browser of your chores and search
03:02 - for code blocks and the first link which
03:04 - will appear here will be from code
03:06 - blocks. org so I'm going to click on
03:08 - this link and here let me just press on
03:13 - consent and here I can read more about
03:17 - code blocks but we want to download it
03:19 - so I'm going to click on this download
03:21 - uh link here and under download it says
03:25 - download the binary release so I'm going
03:27 - to click on download the binary release
03:29 - and then I have the option for the Mac
03:33 - OSX so I'm going to click on this link
03:35 - which says Mac
03:37 - OSX and then I have two links here I can
03:42 - either download the Mac binaries from
03:47 - fsub or sourceforge.net I'm going to
03:51 - choose the second option which is
03:52 - sourceforge.net under Mac OS so I'm
03:55 - going to click on this link which is
03:58 - going to redirect me to to the
04:00 - sourcewatch Donnet website but you don't
04:04 - need to download this version of code
04:08 - blocks so I'm going to cancel the
04:10 - download of this version which starts
04:14 - automatically this is the 32-bit version
04:17 - for COD blocks which is compatible with
04:20 - the previous version of Mac OS but you
04:23 - need to go here once again once the
04:27 - download of that file is complete when
04:29 - when you scroll down you will be
04:31 - redirected to uh the source.net SL
04:36 - projects slode blocks URL here you need
04:40 - to scroll down and then click on this
04:43 - files tab here so click on the files tab
04:46 - and then you need to download the 64bit
04:50 - DMG version here okay so you don't need
04:54 - to uh download the zip file but when you
04:58 - go to the file files option you need to
05:00 - download the DMG version of code blocks
05:05 - here I'm going to give this URL in the
05:08 - description of this video also so you
05:10 - can directly come to this uh website
05:14 - otherwise when you click on the
05:15 - sourcewatch website from the code blocks
05:18 - it's going to download the zip file
05:20 - which we don't require I'm going to uh
05:22 - download this DMG file for the 64bit
05:28 - option and once I click on that option
05:31 - the download of the DMG file will start
05:33 - and not the zip file you can see I have
05:37 - previously downloaded the zip file
05:40 - because the download of the zip file
05:42 - starts automatically which I don't want
05:45 - right I want the DMG file for OSX 64
05:49 - once the file is downloaded click on uh
05:52 - the file which is going to start the
05:55 - installer for code blocks let me
05:58 - minimize the browser
06:00 - now the process of installation is
06:01 - really simple just click on the code
06:04 - blocks icon here press command key and
06:07 - then drag and drop this code blocks icon
06:10 - on top of the applications folder until
06:13 - you see the plus symbol and then leave
06:17 - it on the applications folder so now
06:20 - code blocks is transferred to your
06:24 - applications folder and now I can see
06:26 - this icon here once you see the the code
06:29 - blocks icon or inside your applications
06:32 - folder you can uh just close this
06:36 - installer window and then I can go to
06:38 - Launchpad and then open the code blocks
06:41 - from here or I can even go to the
06:44 - applications folder in the finder and
06:46 - open the code blocks from there just
06:48 - click on the code blocks IDE it's going
06:50 - to start the code blocks IDE now so for
06:53 - the first time when a code block starts
06:56 - it's going to recognize the compiler in
06:58 - my case it has recognized two compilers
07:02 - one is the gnu GCC compiler and other is
07:05 - llvm C length compiler default is the
07:09 - gnu GCC compiler so I'm going to leave
07:12 - it as default you can also leave it as
07:15 - default if you want to change the
07:17 - default compiler to the cang compiler
07:19 - just select that and then set as default
07:22 - so just click on set as default and then
07:25 - you will use the C length compiler but
07:27 - for now I will use the GCC compiler so
07:31 - I'm going to click on okay here which is
07:33 - going to start the code blocks
07:35 - IDE now once the code blocks IDE starts
07:39 - let's create a very simple C++ program
07:41 - so I'm going to click on the file here
07:44 - and then click on new and then I can
07:47 - click on the project option so new
07:49 - project and here you can choose from so
07:54 - many different projects for now I want
07:57 - to create a console application so I'm
08:00 - going to click on Console application
08:02 - here and then click on
08:05 - go and then it says uh we are going to
08:08 - create the console application I'm going
08:10 - to click on next and it will be a C++
08:13 - application so I'm going to select C++
08:15 - and then click on next and then I'm
08:18 - going to provide the project title I'm
08:21 - going to name my project as hello world
08:25 - here and then I can also choose the
08:28 - destination where I want to save this
08:30 - project so I'm going to click on these
08:32 - two dots button and then I want to save
08:37 - this project in my documents folder so
08:39 - I'm going to choose the documents folder
08:41 - and then click on open which is going to
08:44 - save my project in my documents folder
08:47 - now I'm going to click on
08:49 - next and then here you can see I can
08:52 - choose the compiler which is GCC by
08:55 - default here I also have the option to
08:57 - choose the other compiler if I have
09:00 - those compilers right also it says
09:03 - create a debug configuration I will
09:05 - leave it as default also it says create
09:08 - a release configuration I will also
09:10 - leave it as default and then click on
09:12 - finish here once I click on finish my
09:15 - project is created so this is a C++
09:19 - project and here I can see under sources
09:22 - I have one main.cpp file so let me click
09:25 - on that which is going to code blocks
09:27 - application quits unexpectedly and I can
09:31 - see this message which says code blocks
09:33 - quit unexpectedly click report to see
09:36 - the details so let's see how we can
09:39 - solve this problem so for now I'm going
09:40 - to click on ignore once again I'm going
09:43 - to open the code blocks
09:45 - here and once code blocks opens before
09:49 - opening my project what I need to do is
09:52 - I need to click on plugins here and then
09:54 - click on manage plugins and there is a
09:58 - plugin called code completion plugin
10:00 - which causes this error so I'm going to
10:03 - select code completion plugin and then
10:05 - click on disable in front of it so I
10:08 - have disabled this code completion
10:10 - plug-in and once this code completion
10:13 - plugins is disabled I'm going to try to
10:16 - open the project once again so let me
10:19 - just click on file click on open and
10:21 - then click on my project and then click
10:23 - on open once again and this time you
10:26 - will observe that the code blocks
10:29 - doesn't quit unexpectedly and my project
10:32 - is opened so let me just uh click on the
10:36 - main. CPP file here and this is the code
10:40 - which is generated automatically by the
10:44 - code blocks for us so to compile this
10:47 - code I just need to click on this build
10:50 - button so let me click on build button
10:52 - which is going to compile my project and
10:55 - there is no error in it zero error zero
10:57 - warning to run it I'm going to click on
10:59 - this uh Green Run button so when I click
11:02 - on run button says code blocks wants
11:05 - access to control terminal yes because
11:09 - we are creating the terminal application
11:12 - code blocks will run this uh C++ program
11:16 - in the terminal so I'm going to click on
11:18 - okay here and it runs the application in
11:21 - the terminal and it will show this kind
11:25 - of uh problem here so when you see uh
11:29 - this kind of problem on your zsh which
11:31 - says no such file or directory on code
11:34 - blogs what you need to do is um let me
11:38 - just close this terminal go to your code
11:41 - blocks and then here click on settings
11:45 - and then click on
11:47 - environment and under terminal to launch
11:49 - the console program instead of this line
11:53 - so instead of uh this script terminal to
11:55 - launch the console program I need to
11:58 - change this script script a little so I
12:00 - need to change it to uh this uh script
12:03 - so first part is okay Osa script hyphen
12:07 - e tell app terminal hyphen e activate
12:09 - hyphen e do script until do script
12:12 - everything is okay but now it says
12:16 - quoted form of so I need to remove the
12:20 - quoted form of from here so let me uh
12:23 - just remove this from here quot it from
12:28 - off and now this uh script looks fine
12:33 - right so just uh remove that section
12:37 - which says quoted form off and it's
12:39 - going to work so Osa hyphen e uh tell
12:43 - app terminal hyphen e activate hyphen e
12:47 - do script space script and then hyphen e
12:52 - and tell I'm going to click on okay here
12:55 - and once I do that and then when I click
12:59 - On The Run button once again it's going
13:02 - to work you can see it prints hello
13:05 - world now and everything is working this
13:09 - is how you can download and install code
13:11 - blocks on your Mac operating system I
13:14 - hope you enjoyed this video and I will
13:16 - see you in the next video
