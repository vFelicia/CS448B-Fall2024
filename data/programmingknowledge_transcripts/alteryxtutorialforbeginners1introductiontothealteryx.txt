00:01 - hello everyone
00:02 - welcome to this course
00:04 - altrex for beginners in this course we
00:06 - would be discussing all about a tool
00:09 - called altrix we would be learning its
00:12 - practical concepts and we would be also
00:14 - seeing that why is it so useful
00:17 - also i would be showing you the
00:18 - procedure through which you can use it
00:20 - into your day to day lives
00:22 - also we would be seeing that what
00:24 - difference it is going to make and how
00:26 - it is going to prove useful to us
00:29 - so in this video we are going to
00:31 - introduce ourselves to this particular
00:33 - tool and discuss about its features so
00:36 - that you can decide whether to go for
00:37 - this course or not
00:39 - so this is the first video introduction
00:41 - to alteryx
00:43 - let us start by understanding that what
00:46 - actually is ultrix so alteryx is a tool
00:49 - that is primarily used for data cleaning
00:52 - so whenever you have a data set with you
00:55 - and you want to clean it then ninety
00:57 - percent of the task of data cleaning can
00:59 - be done automatically through ultrix
01:02 - apart from this the different features
01:05 - provided by alteryx are all combined
01:07 - into this slide
01:08 - altryx is not just only a data cleaning
01:11 - tool but it is also a predictive
01:13 - analysis tool
01:14 - predictive analysis means that a variety
01:17 - of statistical techniques
01:19 - are combined from like data mining
01:21 - predictive modeling and machine learning
01:24 - which will analyze the historical trends
01:26 - and will make predictions about the
01:28 - future
01:29 - so for this purpose we can use alteryx
01:32 - if you want spatial analysis that is
01:35 - when you want to analyze the locations
01:37 - uh relationships or basically the
01:40 - proximities in a geospatial data to
01:43 - extract the insights
01:45 - then you can use the stool ultrix altex
01:48 - also acts as an etl tool that means to
01:50 - extract transform and load
01:53 - the general procedure of copying the
01:55 - data from one source to destination
01:58 - which can then be used to visualize the
02:01 - data or represent it in a completely
02:03 - different format
02:04 - altryx also acts as a data blending tool
02:07 - that means you can get a data from the
02:09 - different sources and then merge it into
02:12 - a single data warehouse or basically a
02:14 - data set
02:16 - and then analyze it
02:18 - last but not the least ultra excesses
02:20 - says service analysis tool now what is
02:23 - this means cell service analysis tool so
02:26 - once you have created something called a
02:28 - workflow in ultrix now you do not need
02:31 - to create it again and again what you
02:33 - can do is simply combine the alteryx to
02:36 - just
02:37 - follow the same procedures that you have
02:39 - done up till now and ultrix would
02:41 - automatically do the same tasks for you
02:43 - means you can just create the workflow
02:45 - once and use it as many times as you
02:47 - want there is no limit on um using it
02:51 - you can create ones use many times
02:54 - now let us understand that why should we
02:56 - use alteryx so these are some of the
02:59 - features that helps us to understand
03:01 - that why alteryx is so much important
03:03 - for us first of all no coding knowledge
03:06 - is needed for this tool it has a very
03:08 - simple interface if you have a knowledge
03:11 - of excel and some of the features of
03:13 - excel like pivot tables or vlookup then
03:16 - you can simply use electrics for all of
03:19 - your needs so that is why if you do not
03:21 - have a strong coding background then you
03:23 - can use alteryx as well
03:26 - it has a very simple drag and drop
03:28 - interface all of the filters or all of
03:30 - the features all of the tools that you
03:32 - want to use that you can simply just
03:35 - drag and drop suppose you want to sort
03:36 - the data so we have a sorting tool
03:38 - provided to us in altrix all you need to
03:40 - do is drag it and drop it on your
03:42 - dataset and the data side would be
03:43 - sorted if you want to filter it
03:45 - according to particular criteria
03:46 - similarly you can just drag the filter
03:48 - tool and drop it over there and that
03:50 - particular filter would be applied
03:53 - it is compatible with different data
03:55 - sources around uh 80 plus data sources
03:58 - are supported by alteryx that means you
04:01 - can use the data set which is in any
04:03 - format it could be in the form of an
04:05 - excel file a csv file or basically a
04:08 - semi-structured or unstructured json
04:11 - file as well you can simply use it in
04:14 - ultrix import it in altrics and actually
04:17 - analyze it using the tool
04:19 - because it supports a variety of data
04:21 - sources
04:22 - the integration with the power bi tools
04:26 - with the business intelligence tools
04:28 - like power bi tableau qlik sense is also
04:31 - provided to irig so once you have
04:33 - created some of the insights in those
04:34 - tools you can easily interact
04:37 - with
04:38 - that report or with that dashboard using
04:41 - altrix you can actually make a
04:43 - connection between those two and get a
04:45 - better insight of your data
04:48 - now uh
04:50 - the last but not the least it is
04:52 - actually the most important feature of
04:54 - alteryx that is it provides automation
04:56 - of the manual tasks so all the tasks
04:58 - that you have been doing manually up
05:00 - till now you can actually automate them
05:02 - with the help of alteryx and once you
05:05 - have automated those tasks and once the
05:07 - workflow is created you do not have to
05:08 - create it again and again simply you can
05:10 - reuse it as many times as you want
05:14 - now let us take a look at some of the
05:16 - features of alteryx and these are the
05:17 - same features that make it so special
05:21 - so first of all is that it supports 80
05:23 - plus data sources as we have already
05:25 - discussed the data files that you are
05:28 - using in altrix can be in any format
05:30 - like a csv file an excel file json file
05:32 - xml file html file any type of a file if
05:36 - it contains data it is supported by altx
05:39 - you can simply just use it you can
05:41 - import it in address and then
05:43 - uh analyze it
05:45 - one more thing this number of the data
05:48 - sources is actually increasing as new
05:50 - versions of altrix are being released so
05:53 - uh even if your uh
05:56 - data source is not compatible right now
05:58 - it might come in the future
06:00 - it supports all the formats of data like
06:02 - it may be a structured data in the form
06:04 - of a sequel it could be semi-structured
06:06 - or unstructured data in the form of a
06:07 - json files so whatever the format of the
06:10 - data is it is supported by altrix you
06:13 - don't have to worry about the data
06:15 - format if it is not in a tabular format
06:17 - or so
06:18 - there are 260 plus automation tools that
06:21 - are available for analytics in altrix
06:24 - now these automation tools not only
06:26 - reduce our tasks but also make the
06:29 - analysis and the data cleaning process
06:31 - very smooth like you want to filter out
06:33 - some records you want to sort out some
06:34 - records all you got to do is just use
06:36 - these automation tools through a simple
06:39 - drag and drop and use them on your data
06:41 - set and just see that how it works you
06:44 - do not need to
06:45 - perform complex procedures you do not
06:47 - need any kind of according knowledge for
06:49 - this purpose just drag and drop
06:52 - report creation is supported from
06:54 - different data sources that means uh the
06:57 - different bi tools or the different data
06:59 - sources you can create reports using
07:01 - those like once you have created a
07:03 - report or a workflow in altrix then uh
07:06 - you can actually use the different data
07:08 - sources for different sorts of
07:09 - visualizations to be combined together
07:11 - in a single report so this is one of the
07:14 - best features supported by ultrix
07:17 - now once you have created the report and
07:18 - you want to share it with uh your team
07:20 - or with a different set of people then
07:22 - you can export this report in the
07:25 - different file formats that are
07:26 - supported by altrics
07:28 - like pdf excel file or many more
07:31 - uh and also with the upcoming versions
07:34 - this number of
07:36 - file formats salary supported by address
07:37 - is also increasing
07:39 - finally altric supports the reusable
07:42 - workflows what does it means it means
07:44 - that once you have created a workflow
07:46 - you can reuse it as many times as you
07:48 - want you do not need to just perform
07:50 - those same steps again and again and
07:52 - again you can just simply reuse the
07:54 - workflow that you have already created
07:56 - so this is about the features of alteryx
07:59 - and
08:00 - now uh since we know about the basics of
08:03 - altrix and why is it so useful let us
08:06 - see that how can we actually install
08:09 - alteryx into our systems so it is a paid
08:12 - tool but you can get a trial version of
08:15 - 14 days for yourself
08:17 - so we would be just using that trial
08:19 - version only right now okay so for this
08:22 - what you need to do is just basically
08:24 - google ultrix
08:27 - here you will see this website official
08:29 - website www.altrex.com
08:32 - in this official website you need to go
08:34 - to this products option
08:36 - so once this products option is open you
08:38 - will see that these are these different
08:40 - products
08:42 - that are available like designer server
08:44 - intelligence suite etc from this we need
08:46 - to go with this designer product because
08:48 - it is suitable for individuals so let's
08:51 - just click on this learn more option
08:53 - once you click on this learn more option
