00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - an overview of Android activity life
00:12 - cycle so in the last video I have shown
00:15 - you uh that whenever you go inside this
00:18 - Java folder in your app and when you
00:21 - click this main activity this is the
00:24 - main brain or main logic of your Android
00:28 - activity application
00:30 - and this is a Java class which inherits
00:34 - from activity class but when you take a
00:39 - look at this uh here extend means uh
00:43 - inheriting from this class right but you
00:46 - don't see that it's inheriting from the
00:50 - activity class it's inheriting from
00:52 - action bar
00:53 - activity so it's like a multiple
00:56 - inheritance and at the last the base
00:59 - class or super class here is the
01:02 - activity class so to demonstrate this
01:05 - this main activity is inheriting
01:07 - indirectly from activity class what you
01:11 - can do is you can just control just
01:14 - press control Plus or control and hover
01:17 - over this action bar activity and click
01:20 - it and you will reach to the action bar
01:23 - activity and you can see the action bar
01:26 - activity is inheriting from this class
01:29 - which is
01:30 - fragment action so you can just control
01:34 - just press control and hover over this
01:35 - frag fragment action and click it and
01:39 - now you can see this fragment action
01:41 - extends from
01:43 - activity so indirectly your main
01:47 - activity is inheriting from activity
01:51 - class
01:52 - right so
01:55 - now
01:57 - every activity has its life cycle for
02:01 - example when your program or activity
02:06 - launches first method it uh you know
02:10 - looks for or it uh calls is this method
02:14 - which is on create method and we are
02:17 - just overriding uh this method from the
02:21 - class we are inheriting from right so
02:25 - here we are calling it and the first
02:29 - thing when we start our application is
02:33 - we want to launch the layout or set the
02:37 - view of the layout layout is just this
02:40 - design right so the first method which
02:44 - will be called here is the oncreate
02:48 - method in the same uh
02:51 - way here you can call different method
02:54 - for example whenever you run your
02:57 - Android app you can uh you know you can
03:00 - user can uh resume this and you he can
03:03 - go to some other you know Android app
03:08 - for example this Android app
03:10 - and the other Android app which was our
03:14 - actual app was running in the background
03:18 - because it's not closed but it's running
03:20 - in the background but uh you can close
03:23 - this app also
03:26 - by you know going back and close it
03:30 - so there are some method are which are
03:34 - called when you do these all actions
03:38 - when you go uh to your uh menu here you
03:42 - can call your app by clicking you know
03:46 - on the app and it'll open like this
03:49 - right so when you click this uh uh app
03:53 - icon or when you uh you know do some
03:56 - other cool things with your application
03:59 - what are the method which are called uh
04:03 - this you can write here and the overview
04:06 - of these method you can see on Android
04:12 - uh you know website in the documentation
04:15 - this link I'm going to uh give you in
04:17 - the description of this video so you can
04:20 - uh go to uh this documentation this is
04:23 - really extensive documentation and here
04:26 - you will see a
04:28 - diagram which will demonstrate the basic
04:33 - life cycle of an activity so this is uh
04:38 - this is the same uh you know picture uh
04:41 - as this and what happens when you launch
04:45 - your application first method which is
04:47 - called as I have told you is oncreate
04:50 - and this oncreate method calls this set
04:55 - content view which uh sets the layout
04:58 - for you for the activity
05:00 - right then if you uh add this method or
05:05 - overwrite this method on
05:07 - start this uh
05:10 - method is called when your activity
05:13 - starts okay so after creating your uh
05:17 - act uh layout you can call this method
05:20 - so this method is called so this is the
05:22 - you know
05:24 - chronological life cycle of your
05:27 - activity so these are the method me
05:29 - which are called one by one if you you
05:33 - know add this method in your Java uh
05:37 - file main activity Java file then you
05:41 - can you know resume this application or
05:44 - pause this application right and in
05:47 - between this application runs okay so
05:51 - these are the chronological uh you know
05:54 - uh order of these function which can be
05:56 - called by your activity so resume then
06:00 - activity is running then if you want to
06:04 - uh you know call another activity for
06:06 - example you are on the homepage of your
06:09 - uh application and you want to see the
06:11 - about uh page of your application uh you
06:16 - go or you click some button and then
06:18 - this activity which is running is paused
06:23 - and then your new activity uh you know
06:27 - going is going to start okay and then if
06:31 - you unpause this the activity is no
06:33 - longer visible and uh stop okay and uh
06:37 - whenever you uh shut down or you know
06:41 - you close your application it destroys
06:43 - your activity and shut such shuts down
06:48 - right so you can go to this um page and
06:54 - you can read about these activity and
06:57 - these functions what every function
07:00 - means but I'm going to give you uh a
07:04 - example how they are called in this uh
07:09 - chronological order so that we have the
07:12 - better understanding which method is
07:14 - called when when we uh you know launch
07:18 - our application here okay so that's it
07:23 - for uh this video in the next video I'm
07:25 - going to give you this example of uh
07:29 - calling all these method one by one and
07:32 - we will see uh how they are called
07:35 - whenever we launch our activity so I
07:38 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
