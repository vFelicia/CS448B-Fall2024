00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - nodejs tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how we can
00:06 - use streams in nodejs specifically we
00:10 - will talk about readable stream in this
00:12 - video and in the next video we will talk
00:15 - about writeable stream in
00:17 - nodejs so let's get started so first of
00:21 - all what are streams streams are Unix
00:24 - pipe that lets you read data from a
00:28 - source and write WR data to a
00:32 - destination right so for example you
00:36 - want to read a data from a very big file
00:39 - or from a source which has lots and lots
00:44 - of uh data and because you are running a
00:49 - server you don't want to block your
00:52 - server right so if you want to read this
00:55 - file you may want to or you would like
00:59 - to read this file in chunks or you know
01:04 - small portions and once this portion is
01:07 - read you want or you can do something
01:10 - right and streams allows us to do the
01:13 - same so streams allows us for example we
01:18 - want to read a big file streams allows
01:21 - us to read this file chunk by chunk and
01:25 - it will also give the information that
01:28 - this chunk is red and and uh if whole
01:32 - file is readed or not or we can do many
01:36 - uh you know events from this uh data
01:39 - right so let's see how we can use uh
01:43 - streams specifically readable streams
01:46 - right so to use streams we will use the
01:50 - fs module module and we have already
01:53 - seen how we can include uh this module
01:56 - in nodejs just use VAR FS is equal to
01:59 - require FS now we will create a variable
02:04 - called for example readable stream is
02:07 - equal to FS do create read stream and
02:14 - this takes uh argument which is the name
02:18 - of the source so for example I have uh
02:21 - this file whose name is file.txt and it
02:26 - has uh relatively big data so it has has
02:30 - around 500 5,200 lines of data I just
02:35 - copied a random data from some source
02:39 - and for example I want to read this data
02:42 - right now uh this file name uh here we
02:46 - will give as a argument so just give
02:49 - file.txt because it's in the same
02:52 - directory you can see here and now we
02:56 - can use this variable read stream let's
03:01 - name it read stream instead of readable
03:04 - stream okay so this read stream we can
03:10 - uh use to uh listen for some event so
03:15 - basically whenever you use create read
03:18 - stream it inherits from event emitter
03:23 - and we have already uh seen how to use
03:26 - event Metter in the previous videos so
03:30 - it inherits from Event Event emitter so
03:33 - we can call the method which are present
03:37 - in event emitter class also so we can uh
03:41 - you know trigger on event or emit U
03:44 - method using this read stream now there
03:48 - is a predefined uh event in uh create
03:53 - read stream which is called Data okay
03:57 - and which allows us to read our file in
04:02 - chunks so just write read stream and
04:06 - then we will just write on which we are
04:08 - inheriting from event emitter and we
04:12 - will listen for the event called data
04:16 - and then we will just create a Anonymous
04:19 - function here and this Anonymous
04:23 - function will read chunk of data so just
04:27 - write
04:28 - chunk and then we will just uh close our
04:34 - function okay so in this variable
04:38 - whenever this uh event is triggered then
04:42 - this chunk uh will contain some chunk of
04:47 - data from this file right this chunk
04:50 - variable will be full and then we will
04:54 - uh you know use this chunk of data from
04:56 - this file okay so for for example what I
05:00 - want to do is I want to just uh console
05:03 - log this data so I will just write
05:06 - console
05:07 - log chunk here okay and uh one chunk of
05:12 - data is red so we can uh just give a
05:17 - line kind of uh console log here so we
05:21 - know that this is one chunk okay after
05:24 - this line right so let's see how it
05:29 - works works so I'm going to just open
05:31 - the terminal and run my
05:34 - app and you can see there are few chunks
05:38 - which are read from this file okay so
05:42 - you can see um my first of all this line
05:46 - is uh you know printed on the terminal
05:49 - because of this console log and then we
05:53 - have the chunk of data and then again
05:57 - this uh line again and this chunk of
06:00 - data so it's uh reading the data in
06:03 - chunks and when uh all the file is read
06:07 - then uh we have the output but this is
06:10 - not familiar because uh this is uh
06:13 - reading in hacks right we haven't
06:16 - defined what type of uh data we are
06:19 - reading so you can see in the file. text
06:22 - we have a normal uh you know normal text
06:27 - and it's reading in uh hex data right so
06:32 - how we can tell uh this function or
06:36 - method to read in readable text you can
06:40 - guess I think you can just uh write here
06:44 - the type the second argument is utf8 for
06:49 - example and then just save it and then
06:52 - we will run it
06:54 - again and now you can see it's reading
06:58 - in the normal text so you can see this
07:01 - line and then the chunk of data which is
07:04 - red and once again we will see when we
07:08 - will go a little bit up so this is the
07:10 - next line and whenever you will go up
07:14 - you will see uh these uh this kind of
07:16 - line so now we are reading the normal
07:19 - text but in chunks again right so this
07:25 - uh event data will allow us to read uh
07:29 - the file for example in chunks right and
07:34 - whenever one chunk is readed you can do
07:37 - some logical you know stuff with this uh
07:40 - chunk of data right now there is one
07:44 - another uh event called end so you know
07:48 - that you have completed reading the file
07:52 - so instead of data whenever you use end
07:56 - and let's instead of uh this console log
07:59 - we just say end end here okay and let's
08:05 - read the file again or execute the
08:08 - program again and once this uh data is
08:11 - readed this line is printed which is due
08:15 - to this triggering of event called end
08:19 - event okay so once the file is read
08:22 - completely this event will be triggered
08:25 - and then this line will be printed or
08:28 - whatever code you will uh write here
08:31 - will be printed so for example I will uh
08:35 - create a variable here called data right
08:39 - and what I want to do is I want to store
08:42 - all the uh you know text of the file in
08:46 - this variable and once my data is uh
08:50 - read or once my file is read I want to
08:53 - print the content of this data so
08:57 - instead of uh this what I can do here is
09:01 - I can just write data plus equals uh
09:06 - chunk something like this so what it's
09:09 - going to do is it's going to concatenate
09:12 - this chunk into this data variable
09:16 - right and once uh all the file is read I
09:19 - want to print it so I will just do
09:23 - console log here and I will print this
09:26 - data variable so this essentially will
09:29 - contain all the file content okay and
09:34 - let's uh just comment this uh code out
09:38 - because we don't need it and let's run
09:41 - the program
09:43 - again so program is uh running so this
09:49 - time once the you know data is red then
09:54 - it's printed using this uh console log
09:58 - because we we are not you know printing
10:01 - using this we have already commented out
10:03 - right so this time it this uh line is
10:08 - printing this text all the text okay and
10:12 - once the text is uh printed this line of
10:15 - code will execute and it will print end
10:18 - here which is happening here okay so
10:22 - this is how basically you can uh use
10:26 - readable streams in uh not JS right now
10:31 - there are many options related to read
10:35 - stream and write streams so for example
10:39 - one of the option we have set here
10:41 - instead of setting the encoding from the
10:44 - second argument there is a special
10:46 - method which you can use to set this end
10:48 - coding which is uh the set end coding so
10:52 - instead of this you can even do this
10:55 - also and the code will run fine okay so
10:59 - let's run the code again and it's going
11:01 - to run it you know normally okay so just
11:06 - go to the nodejs documentation on its
11:10 - website and you will find many useful uh
11:14 - functions and methods there which you
11:16 - can use in your code according to your
11:20 - requirement this is just uh the
11:22 - introduction to you know streams and uh
11:25 - specifically the readable streams so I
11:28 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
11:29 - wait comment and subscribe and bye for
11:33 - now
