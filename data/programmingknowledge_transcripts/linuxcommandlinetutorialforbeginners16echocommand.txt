00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how we can use echo command in
00:05 - Linux and I'm also going to show you how
00:07 - we can declare variables and how we can
00:10 - use these variables with our echo
00:13 - command so let's get started so first of
00:16 - all to use echo command you just use
00:19 - echo and then some text for example
00:22 - hello world and press Enter and what it
00:27 - does according to its name it just
00:30 - displayed displays whatever you right
00:34 - after this echo command so it echoes
00:37 - anything which you right after this
00:39 - keyword echo right now you may say that
00:43 - it's good for nothing because it's just
00:46 - echoing whatever we write after this and
00:49 - it's not really useful but the use of
00:53 - this echo command comes when you are
00:56 - using some scripting for example bash
00:59 - scripting and then it becomes really you
01:03 - know important sometimes to use echo and
01:07 - maybe in the next video I will show you
01:09 - a brief introduction to scripting also
01:12 - and then you will be able to understand
01:15 - how echo is important right so this is
01:19 - how you can use echo but there is a good
01:22 - practice to use echo also which is you
01:26 - just use echo and then you use double
01:29 - quotes around your text or whatever you
01:33 - want to display so for example hello
01:36 - world again and then it displays the
01:39 - same content but it's better to use
01:42 - double quotes around your text okay now
01:47 - how to use variables in terminal or in
01:52 - Linux so in order to declare a variable
01:54 - you just need to give a name to your
01:58 - variable for example my where for my
02:03 - variable and then give equals to sign so
02:07 - it's important here to note that
02:10 - I'm not providing any space between the
02:13 - variable name and equal to symbol
02:15 - so don't provide any space in between
02:18 - okay and then give any value to your
02:22 - variable for example I will give some
02:24 - name for example mark and when you press
02:27 - ENTER it does nothing but whenever you
02:31 - want to you know know the value of this
02:34 - variable you can use echo so just write
02:37 - echo and then the dollar symbol so just
02:41 - use this kind of a dollar symbol and
02:44 - then the name of your variable for
02:47 - example my wire okay and press ENTER and
02:51 - it will display the content of this
02:53 - variable right so what we have done here
02:56 - is we have given some name to our
02:59 - variable and we have assigned some value
03:01 - to our variable using equal to and in
03:04 - order to display the content of a
03:06 - variable you can use echo and a dollar
03:10 - symbol before your variable name and
03:12 - then variable name and it will echo the
03:15 - content of the variable right now for
03:18 - example I can declare some other
03:21 - variable also but before this I want to
03:24 - let you know that this variable is only
03:29 - valid for this session of the terminal
03:32 - so as soon as you will you know close
03:35 - the terminal then your variable value
03:38 - will be gone right so it's only valid
03:41 - for this session of the terminal right
03:43 - now let's declare some other variable
03:46 - for example X is equal to 10 which is a
03:49 - integer for example okay and press Enter
03:53 - and does nothing and then we can echo
03:56 - something like this so echo and then for
04:01 - example I will just write in double
04:03 - quotes the value of x is and then the
04:11 - dollar symbol and then the name of your
04:15 - variable which is X right and press
04:18 - enter and what it prints the value of x
04:22 - is
04:23 - which is the value we have assigned to
04:26 - our variable right so in this way you
04:29 - can declare a variable and you know echo
04:32 - its value using echo and these two
04:35 - things are very important whenever you
04:37 - are using scripting right and that we
04:42 - will see in the next video now there are
04:45 - some options
04:46 - you can use with echo so for example
04:50 - when for example you want to escape
04:54 - something then what you can do so for
04:58 - example I will just use echo and then I
05:02 - will use - 'flag for escape and then I
05:06 - will use single quotes here and for
05:09 - example I will say some text so some and
05:14 - I will just provide this for example
05:18 - backslash and then the next word for
05:23 - example text okay and this will be
05:27 - escaped because we are using - see here
05:31 - and let's see what happens so once we
05:34 - press Enter it gives the tab between the
05:39 - text so one thing worth noting here is
05:45 - whenever you will give this flag called
05:49 - - e it will enable interpretation of
05:53 - backslash as an escape sequence and then
05:57 - you can use a different kind of sequence
06:01 - something like for example backspace or
06:05 - you can use a newline you know escape
06:08 - sequence or you can use tabs as we have
06:12 - seen that it haven't printed some and
06:15 - then text it has printed some and then e
06:19 - XD because backslash t is for tab in for
06:25 - horizontal temp to be more precise and
06:28 - you know in bash scripting right so
06:32 - whenever you want to
06:35 - use you know backslashes or escape
06:37 - sequence you can use - II as a flag
06:41 - right so let's see some other examples
06:45 - of using this so I will just echo it
06:49 - once again and this time what I'm going
06:51 - to do is I will use backslash N and then
06:54 - some text something like this and press
06:57 - Enter and you can see it prints the you
07:01 - know text in the new line so you can see
07:04 - some is in the first line and text in
07:07 - the new line after the space right or
07:10 - you can do something like this without
07:12 - space and press Enter and you can see
07:14 - both are printed in the next line and
07:19 - there are some more you know sequences
07:22 - for example backslash B or other
07:25 - sequences something like backslash a
07:28 - which is for a lot or some other
07:32 - sequences which you can you know search
07:35 - for using Man Man pages and you will be
07:39 - good to go so this is how you can use
07:41 - echo and you can declare variables in
07:45 - Linux I hope you enjoyed this video
