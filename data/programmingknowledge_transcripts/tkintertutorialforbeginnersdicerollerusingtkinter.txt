00:03 - hey everyone till now we have learned a
00:06 - lot about inter widgets and their
00:08 - functionalities it's time we put them to
00:11 - use so today we would make a simple dice
00:14 - on the tincter window using the random
00:16 - module and the button widget it would be
00:19 - a six sided die so on rolling a
00:22 - six-sided die you get a number and
00:24 - that's what would happen here we would
00:27 - get a number in between one to six
00:28 - randomly picked by the random module so
00:32 - basically whenever I click on the button
00:34 - I should see a number randomly displayed
00:37 - on the screen so let's get started
00:40 - I'll first import tincter
00:43 - or rather I'll write from printer import
00:48 - star
00:50 - and I'll write win equals CK
00:54 - and win dot title
00:56 - let the title be dice
01:01 - and
01:03 - I'll have to visit I'll add a widget so
01:06 - I'll write button
01:08 - equals
01:09 - button
01:13 - where do I want the button I want it on
01:15 - the window so I'll write when
01:18 - and I'll given the width to be 20.
01:23 - and background to be
01:27 - light yellow
01:30 - then I can given the foreground to be
01:33 - blue
01:37 - and
01:38 - I'll leave the command for right now
01:41 - just write command equals
01:44 - and we'll talk about it later a little
01:46 - later then I'll given a border of three
01:50 - and relief Let It Be sunken
01:55 - active background let it be white
02:02 - and the text is played on the button
02:03 - that'll be
02:07 - roll in cups
02:11 - okay
02:12 - then I'll pack this I'll write button
02:15 - dot back
02:19 - now I would also need label widget in
02:22 - order to display the chosen number by
02:24 - the random module so I'll write label
02:29 - equals label
02:31 - so that's the widget and when
02:36 - width let it be 20 so that the button
02:38 - and label are in Sim alignment
02:42 - and background color Let It Be sky blue
02:47 - foreground that will be purple
02:51 - okay
02:53 - now I will Define a function that will
02:56 - assign the value of text parameter of
02:58 - the label widget so I'll write Def
03:02 - IC number
03:05 - so in this function
03:06 - a random number would be picked in
03:09 - between 1 to 6 and also that number
03:12 - would be assigned to the text parameter
03:14 - of the label so that would be displayed
03:16 - on the screen so how would I do that
03:18 - it's very simple so I have def big num
03:22 - and I'll write label
03:25 - text
03:26 - so this is a dictionary label object
03:29 - and I'll assign the value
03:33 - SAR
03:35 - string random dot Rand int one to six
03:40 - okay so a six-sided die has six numbers
03:43 - on it so I have used round in so that I
03:46 - can include both one and six so this
03:49 - piece of line picks a random number
03:51 - converts it into a string then assigns
03:54 - that to the text of label
03:56 - now I would have this function as the
04:00 - command for the button widget so this is
04:02 - a dictionary label object so I have
04:04 - simply accessed the text parameter of
04:06 - this label widget that I created just
04:08 - now okay and I have assigned it this
04:11 - value that is randomly picked string
04:14 - okay cool then I need to pack the label
04:18 - too so I'll write label dot pack
04:25 - so I left the command of button wizard
04:29 - empty now I'll just given the function
04:32 - pick num
04:35 - okay so whenever we click on the button
04:37 - we are calling the pick num function and
04:40 - it assigns the labels text a random
04:42 - number in between one to six
04:45 - okay so we're done with what was
04:48 - required and I can simply run the events
04:51 - Loop I'll write win dot main Loop
04:56 - so let's run this and let's check if we
05:00 - get randomly picked numbers
05:03 - so I have my screen and
05:07 - when I click on roll button I can see
05:10 - new numbers appearing
05:13 - random number is appearing so that's the
05:16 - use of the random module
05:18 - and
05:20 - it's working quite fine so here we
05:23 - combine two widgets together to get an
05:27 - application
05:28 - you can do the same and
05:31 - the more you practice the more you'll
05:33 - get better at it the more easily you'll
05:35 - be able to handle the widgets in enter
05:38 - I hope you understood this example
05:42 - is it was simple
05:43 - thank you
