00:00 - and now in this video we are going to
00:01 - cover the one command that is the change
00:03 - mode or you can say chmod also
00:06 - basically this command is used to change
00:08 - the permissions so this thing we have
00:10 - covered in our last video okay
00:14 - so now a particular chmod is one of the
00:16 - command that we basically use to change
00:18 - the permissions of the certain files or
00:21 - directories you can say
00:22 - okay if you don't want to provide a
00:25 - permission to any user or any groups or
00:29 - anything any other user whom you don't
00:31 - want to provide access or want to
00:33 - provide access then you can use this
00:35 - particular command okay
00:38 - so now in this video first of all let me
00:40 - increase the size so it will be visible
00:42 - to you so now what we have to do i will
00:44 - create one directory that is uh
00:50 - access dni
00:51 - like this
00:57 - now what i have to do i will create uh
00:59 - two folders or you can say directors
01:02 - also
01:04 - secret one
01:07 - secret two
01:10 - and one file that is
01:17 - private.txt okay
01:22 - now you can say i have done a list so
01:24 - these are all the files or directory
01:26 - which you have created
01:28 - now when i will do a headless iphone so
01:29 - you can get these information of the
01:31 - long format in the long format okay so i
01:34 - hope you are aware of this what is brwx
01:38 - okay and what is this iphone i hope you
01:40 - but uh let me tell you one more time
01:42 - like what are these things
01:44 - so basically hyphen is for files r is
01:46 - for read so if you will provide read
01:49 - permission
01:50 - then you can read that file then if you
01:52 - provide write then you can write
01:53 - therefore execute then that file will be
01:56 - executable okay
01:59 - so
02:00 - for uh form like in-depth information
02:02 - you can watch our previous video on the
02:04 - permissions okay
02:06 - so now what we have to do uh
02:09 - today in this video what we will go uh
02:11 - going to do like we will change the
02:13 - permissions of certain files or
02:15 - directories okay
02:17 - so now uh the command which i was
02:19 - talking about that is chmod it's
02:21 - basically stands for change mode okay
02:24 - change mode of what files or directories
02:27 - so we have learned already learned the
02:29 - uh like two
02:31 - representations of this uh
02:34 - permissions like one is a uh
02:36 - numerical and one is alphabetical like
02:39 - when you will do rwx it is alphabetical
02:42 - and 4 2 1 is for
02:44 - what numerical okay
02:48 - so now what i will do i will first
02:51 - clear the screen and let's hyphenate so
02:53 - now you can see the file permission of
02:56 - this private.txt
02:58 - so this uh
03:00 - is file and this is this like file has
03:04 - not any executable permission of this of
03:07 - the user
03:09 - or any other like on group also and for
03:12 - others it has only read permission okay
03:16 - so
03:17 - now what i have to do
03:19 - i will try to add
03:22 - executable permissions to this
03:24 - particular file
03:26 - okay
03:27 - so how can i do it so the most and
03:31 - simple approach is chmod
03:36 - plus plus means basically when you want
03:39 - to add
03:40 - permissions to each and every like user
03:43 - group and others
03:45 - so then we will use plus so now what we
03:47 - have to do i have to use x like i have
03:50 - to add executable permission to this
03:52 - file
03:54 - then file name
03:55 - then enter
03:57 - now again i will try to check the
03:59 - permission so here you can see
04:01 - in users also executables has been added
04:04 - in groups also executables has been
04:06 - added and in
04:08 - what we say in others also executables
04:11 - has been added so this is the most basic
04:14 - approach for adding uh permissions in
04:17 - some files or directories and here you
04:19 - can see
04:20 - the color has been also changed because
04:22 - it has now the executable permission
04:24 - that's why color has been changed from
04:26 - normal to
04:28 - green
04:29 - okay
04:31 - so uh what if you want to remove
04:34 - permissions okay so there is also way
04:37 - for it if i want to remove permissions
04:40 - like
04:41 - executable
04:42 - okay so what i will do minus x minus y
04:45 - minus this because
04:47 - we use minus to remove the
04:50 - permissions
04:51 - now again you can give the file name
04:53 - that is private.txt again same thing i
04:56 - will repeat ls iphone l and here you can
04:58 - see executable permission has been
05:00 - removed from the user also group also
05:02 - and others also
05:04 - okay
05:05 - so this is the simple basic approach
05:07 - what if you want to remove
05:10 - like
05:12 - what we can say all the permissions
05:15 - so if i will do
05:17 - chmod
05:19 - minus rw
05:21 - private.txt
05:25 - now here you can see
05:27 - all the permissions has been removed
05:29 - from this private.txt
05:31 - like a
05:32 - user has also know any permission or
05:35 - whether the
05:37 - groups has also not not any permission
05:39 - and others also have has not any
05:41 - permission
05:42 - so now what will happen i will try to
05:44 - access this file
05:47 - so let's see what happens
05:50 - here you can see permission is denied
05:53 - why it's showing this error because
05:55 - the read permission like we have removed
05:58 - all the permissions so simultaneously
06:00 - permission has also be removed
06:03 - okay so what i if i will add only the
06:06 - read permission okay what will happen
06:08 - now
06:12 - chmod plus read
06:16 - then file name
06:19 - again i will do a less hyphen l and here
06:21 - you will see the read permission has
06:23 - been added to all the groups
06:25 - now what i will do i will try to access
06:28 - this file private.txt
06:30 - and here you can see uh but nothing is
06:33 - done that's why it's showing like
06:35 - nothing else has been printed but uh
06:38 - now you can see we can access this
06:41 - but here also you can see the right
06:42 - permission is not there so what if i
06:45 - will try to write some kind of files or
06:47 - some kind of thing
06:48 - or text in this file then let's see what
06:50 - happens whether we are able to write or
06:52 - not
06:53 - so here you can see permission denied
06:55 - why because you don't have right
06:57 - permission to change
07:00 - to change anything in this particular
07:02 - file
07:03 - okay
07:05 - so uh i hope you got it like how this
07:08 - like we can
07:09 - remove permissions we can add
07:11 - permissions then how we can do certain
07:14 - permissions together or add or remove
07:17 - okay
07:18 - like we did here like video we do two
07:20 - permissions
07:22 - together in this case hyphen rw okay
07:26 - so uh this approach is basically applies
07:29 - for if you want to apply certain
07:31 - permission for all the
07:34 - like
07:35 - for all these three like for the users
07:37 - also for the groups also and for the
07:41 - this one
07:42 - others also
07:43 - what if you want to apply permissions to
07:46 - only user
07:48 - okay
07:49 - so how will you do it
07:51 - okay
07:52 - so in this case what will happen how you
07:55 - can do it
07:57 - like uh let me clear the screen
08:00 - lsi funnel okay
08:02 - now i what i want to do i want to give
08:04 - the read sorry write permission to only
08:07 - the user okay
08:09 - so how i can do it ch chmod
08:13 - then for user we use u
08:15 - and equal to is used to
08:18 - like assign certain only a specified
08:21 - permission
08:22 - to that particular
08:23 - user group or other okay now i will use
08:26 - here
08:28 - w
08:29 - and then
08:30 - private.txt
08:33 - and here you can see
08:36 - w has been added okay but uh
08:43 - yeah but read permission has been
08:45 - removed but so basically what happens
08:48 - here in this case
08:49 - when you provide this
08:50 - u equal to w
08:53 - so it only
08:55 - like what we can say it only ah like
08:59 - add that permission and whatever you
09:01 - have a default permission it will get
09:03 - removed
09:04 - okay
09:05 - so when we will use equal so it will
09:07 - just replace or you can say it will
09:09 - remove the other permission and it will
09:11 - add this new one okay
09:13 - so now what i have to do
09:18 - i will do
09:19 - like add
09:20 - read permission again in this
09:23 - user
09:24 - so how i can do it
09:26 - chmod u plus
09:29 - read okay private.txt
09:33 - so here you can see we have added read
09:35 - permission as well in this particular
09:38 - file
09:40 - what if you want to give
09:42 - like
09:45 - write permission to this one
09:47 - to others two groups also for for groups
09:50 - so there is a notation of
09:52 - what we can say g
09:54 - okay
09:56 - and again unless hyphen if you do a you
09:58 - can see
10:00 - right permission has been added and for
10:02 - others we use
10:04 - o
10:09 - again ls iphone l and here you can see
10:11 - the
10:12 - right permission has been added in this
10:14 - private dot
10:16 - txt file okay
10:18 - so in this way uh you can add remove
10:20 - permission for users for groups uh or
10:24 - for others okay
10:27 - so this is basically for the like what
10:29 - we can say uh alphabetical notation okay
10:34 - but
10:35 - but numerical notation is i think it's
10:38 - so
10:39 - good to use like it is easy also you can
10:42 - easily understand but if you're beginner
10:44 - you will think like yeah this is a easy
10:46 - so
10:47 - so now what i have to do
10:51 - i have i will remove all the permission
10:53 - from this uh
10:55 - what we can say private.txt file
10:59 - so
11:00 - chmod
11:06 - minus rw from all it will remove this
11:09 - from all the
11:12 - okay
11:15 - new permissions are w minus
11:21 - okay
11:23 - uh let me try to remove like this like a
11:26 - equal to
11:35 - yeah
11:37 - so now here you can see all the
11:38 - permission has been removed y 0 0 i will
11:41 - tell you uh
11:42 - in a little bit now
11:44 - so now what we have to do
11:48 - we will add permissions in this
11:50 - particular file using the octal notation
11:53 - of the
11:55 - like this octal notation of what we can
11:58 - say
11:59 - permission
12:00 - so
12:02 - let me uh like to
12:03 - tell you those things again so that will
12:06 - be helpful for you
12:07 - so for octal notation what happens we
12:09 - use r equal to 4
12:12 - okay
12:14 - and
12:17 - we use
12:19 - write
12:21 - 2
12:22 - and execute equal to one
12:24 - okay so if you want to give
12:28 - the
12:30 - means all permissions okay like read
12:33 - write execute to particular user or
12:35 - particular group or particular
12:38 - other
12:39 - okay
12:40 - so
12:41 - what you will need to do you will need
12:42 - to give
12:43 - it as a 7 like you want to give 4 also
12:47 - you want to give 2 also you want to give
12:49 - x
12:50 - also okay so overall it is seven
12:54 - so let me tell you with an example so
12:56 - that will be easy to understand okay so
12:59 - now what i will do ch mode
13:01 - seven seven seven
13:04 - this seven is for first seven is for
13:06 - user
13:07 - second seven is for group and this third
13:09 - seven is for others
13:11 - so if i will do seven seven seven it
13:13 - will give all the permission to
13:15 - all those user group and
13:18 - others and now i will release iphone and
13:21 - here you can see all the permission has
13:23 - been added to that particular
13:25 - private.txt file
13:26 - so
13:27 - now i will do some kind of changes i
13:29 - will again remove all the permission by
13:32 - applying 0 0 0 to all those
13:35 - okay
13:39 - so here i have removed all those
13:41 - permissions so now in this case what i
13:42 - have to do i have to only give the read
13:45 - permission okay
13:47 - let me open a text file for you
13:51 - or another terminal i will open
14:05 - so for our what we have for
14:08 - for write what we have to for execute
14:10 - what we have done
14:11 - so in this case what i want to give
14:14 - the user only i want to give them read
14:17 - and write okay
14:19 - so for user i will just write six
14:22 - okay
14:23 - and i want to give the group only write
14:26 - permission so two and i don't want any
14:28 - kind of permission to others so i will
14:30 - give it there as zero
14:32 - okay and then find them
14:36 - so now here you can see we have only
14:38 - read write permission to this
14:41 - user
14:42 - only write permission to the group
14:44 - and there is no any permission to the
14:47 - what we can say
14:48 - uh others okay
14:51 - so uh in this i hope you got it like how
14:53 - you can change the permission based on
14:56 - this octal number i hope you got it
14:58 - there like we have covered this in the
14:59 - last video okay so r equal to four to
15:02 - one that is seven if it is seven it will
15:05 - give you all the permissions did that
15:07 - execute together okay
15:10 - now what if you want to uh
15:14 - give permissions like
15:18 - what you can say
15:20 - suppose if you want to change permission
15:22 - uh
15:23 - from read write for user i will just
15:25 - give them as a
15:28 - one let's see what happens
15:32 - so here you can see
15:34 - only
15:36 - like what you can say
15:38 - others has been added execute okay not
15:41 - anyone else okay
15:43 - so this is a happening i think because
15:45 - of uh we have provided only one
15:48 - one means uh there is not a three values
15:52 - so now what we will do
15:56 - i will provide one to everyone
15:58 - let's see what happens
16:00 - you will see you have to only play with
16:02 - it when you will not play then you will
16:04 - not learn anything okay
16:06 - so
16:07 - that's all depends upon you so here you
16:09 - can see if i provided one to everyone so
16:11 - only execute permission has been added
16:12 - to all of them
16:14 - okay
16:16 - and if i provide two
16:20 - so
16:22 - let's see what happens
16:25 - only right permission has been added
16:28 - okay
16:30 - so i hope you got it uh
16:32 - let me provide the
16:34 - like
16:36 - for user i will provide only execute
16:39 - for
16:40 - group i will provide
16:43 - write and execute that is three
16:45 - and other zero
16:47 - what happens
16:49 - same execute write execute and zero
16:53 - okay so i hope you got it like uh
16:57 - how you can uh do or change the
17:00 - permissions with the help of this octal
17:02 - numbers and all okay
17:04 - so uh that's all for today yeah one more
17:06 - concept is remaining here like uh
17:09 - when i will do a list iphone l here you
17:11 - will sometimes get uh hyphen uh high not
17:14 - hyphen you will get instead of x you
17:16 - will get some kind sometime s
17:18 - so s is nothing but a set you add it
17:21 - basically means like when you provide
17:23 - the file uh like
17:26 - with that permission so what will happen
17:29 - it will run that particular file on
17:31 - behalf of you okay
17:34 - so
17:35 - let me
17:36 - check about the password
17:58 - okay so here you can see the s and here
18:01 - who is the user root is the user and
18:04 - also here is root is the user i hope you
18:06 - know about the root user like this is
18:08 - the main user if
18:09 - if you are not able to run any find you
18:12 - don't have any question then you you can
18:13 - use the
18:15 - root user to then run those files
18:17 - so here what happens this is the
18:19 - password is one of the commands to
18:21 - change the password of your uh pc okay
18:25 - or your this machine
18:26 - so basically what happens when we run
18:28 - this password command so we basically
18:30 - run this password command on behalf of
18:33 - whom on behalf of this root user that's
18:36 - why we have given it them as a s
18:38 - permission that is the set uid
18:40 - permission okay what will happen enable
18:42 - you will run this password command okay
18:45 - so what happens
18:48 - it will
18:50 - like say you are changing
18:51 - password for ios okay so i don't have to
18:53 - change it right now
18:55 - so here what is happening this command
18:57 - is running on behalf of this
19:00 - rooty so that's why we provide that
19:02 - as permission so this is basically a
19:04 - special permission you can learn more
19:05 - about this on the google okay
19:08 - so i don't have to change
19:12 - okay
19:13 - i will just
19:15 - close the terminal that's all
19:18 - so i hope you got it like how you can do
19:20 - with the octal representation with the
19:23 - alphabetical notation
19:25 - so that's all for today
