00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use open
00:05 - file dialogue with your Visual Basic
00:07 - Windows Form application so I have this
00:09 - basic project which have one form and I
00:13 - have taken a button and I've changed the
00:15 - text of this button as open file path
00:18 - and I will also take uh text box from
00:22 - here and place it here and uh what else
00:26 - I need is a open file dialogue so I will
00:30 - go to the toolbox and search for the
00:33 - open file dialogue here it is and I will
00:36 - drag and drop into the form and you will
00:38 - notice that this will go below your
00:43 - form because it's not a part of your
00:46 - form it's not visible in your form okay
00:49 - and you will notice also that you have
00:53 - this open file dialogue one name for
00:58 - this open file dialogue okay now I will
01:02 - select my button and double click it and
01:04 - here I will write a condition so I will
01:06 - write
01:08 - if open file
01:12 - dialogue
01:15 - dot show
01:19 - dialogue and it has automatically
01:23 - created then but I don't want them is
01:25 - equal
01:27 - to dialog result
01:32 - dot
01:34 - okay and then if this is okay so what it
01:41 - this sentence is doing is it will open
01:45 - the open file dialogue and if the result
01:47 - of the file dialogue or the path of
01:50 - which we have selected from the open
01:51 - file dialogue is valid then it will
01:54 - execute the piece of the code which we
01:56 - want to execute so here we will uh copy
01:59 - the path of the file we will select from
02:01 - the open file dialogue and show it in
02:03 - the text box so I'll will
02:05 - write text box one which is the name of
02:08 - my text
02:09 - box dot
02:12 - text is equal to
02:15 - O open file dialogue
02:21 - 1 do file
02:25 - name
02:27 - okay so now I have written this piece of
02:30 - codee and let's see what it does so here
02:35 - is the form I will when I click the
02:38 - button it opens the open file dialogue
02:41 - and I can choose any file for example
02:43 - this text file and when I click open it
02:47 - copies the path of the file text file
02:50 - into my text box okay now it's done
02:53 - there are some other properties which
02:56 - you can set with this open file dialogue
02:59 - so for example just select your open
03:02 - file dialogue and first of all we can
03:04 - change the title of the open file
03:06 - dialogue so for example we write
03:10 - open
03:11 - file and you can also set the initial
03:15 - directory of the file so just go to the
03:18 - property called initial directory and
03:20 - here for example I want to set this
03:21 - initial directory as C file so I can
03:24 - write C colon and back slash okay this
03:29 - is the initial directory I want to open
03:32 - one other thing you can do is you can uh
03:37 - filter your files for example you want
03:41 - only want to open the text file then you
03:44 - can set a filter for the text file from
03:46 - here also or you can set the filter for
03:51 - the text file in this button click event
03:53 - also what you can do is just double
03:55 - click this button and just make a space
03:58 - above this if condition and below this
04:02 - button click event and just copy this
04:04 - open file dialog one and write dot
04:09 - filter is equal to and give this double
04:14 - quotation and here you can write the
04:16 - filter for your file so for example you
04:18 - can
04:20 - write text file this is the uh text
04:25 - which is given by you so you can give uh
04:28 - any text here
04:30 - but after this we give this pipe or or
04:33 - sign and we give
04:36 - star.
04:38 - txt so what this means
04:41 - is the open file dialogue will filter
04:44 - all the file which it sees with the ex
04:47 - extension of txt now for example you
04:52 - want to see also the PDF files then just
04:58 - write this P vertical P once again and
05:02 - write PDF uh files which is a optional
05:07 - text which is given by you so this text
05:09 - can be anything but the extension so
05:13 - after that give one more pipe and then
05:16 - write
05:18 - star.pdf
05:20 - so it will open the every file or it
05:23 - will filter every file which has the
05:25 - extension PDF right now when I run the
05:30 - program and when I click this
05:34 - button you can see here it can see the
05:38 - text file which is set by me and it can
05:41 - see
05:43 - the PDF file which is set by me so you
05:47 - will be able to only see the text file
05:50 - and
05:52 - the PDF files right so let's search if I
05:57 - have some p PDF or textt
06:06 - files so I will go to some folder
06:11 - which can have the PDF file so I will
06:14 - choose the filter for PDF files here and
06:18 - now you can see I can see only the PDF
06:22 - files and not any other files or if I
06:26 - want
06:27 - to search for the text file which I
06:31 - don't have here then it will filter for
06:34 - the text files right but it's searching
06:36 - for the PDF file because this folder
06:39 - contains only PDF files and other files
06:42 - which are not text
06:44 - files and if you want to choose all the
06:47 - files what you need to do is just go
06:51 - here and give this pip once again and
06:54 - write
06:56 - all files and once again the pipe and
07:01 - write star. star it will show you all
07:05 - the files with all the extensions right
07:09 - so once again I will open the file
07:12 - dialogue and now when I choose here all
07:17 - files it will show me all file
07:20 - extensions this extension or when I go
07:24 - to other
07:26 - folders it will show me
07:29 - other files file extension which I was
07:32 - not able to see earlier right so you in
07:36 - this way you can set the filters now
07:38 - there is one more good property here in
07:43 - this open file dialogue which is you can
07:46 - select multiple files so let me
07:49 - demonstrate how can you select multiple
07:52 - files so
07:54 - just click this text box and let's make
07:57 - this uh text box multi-line
07:59 - okay so it it can show multiple
08:03 - lines and then just select this open
08:07 - file dialogue
08:08 - and search for the property called
08:11 - multi- select by default it's false so
08:14 - make it true and now you will be able to
08:17 - select multiple files now what you need
08:21 - to do
08:23 - is you can go here all the code will
08:27 - remain same but in here what you can do
08:31 - is instead of open file dialog 1. file
08:35 - name you just need to
08:38 - give open file dialogue 1. file names so
08:42 - we have added this extra s to the
08:46 - file and you can just give plus sign
08:50 - here so it will just give you
08:53 - the uh uh path one by one or it's better
08:58 - to show it in the message box then it
09:01 - will demonstrate it better so let's make
09:05 - a message box so I will create
09:09 - a message
09:11 - box do
09:14 - show and in the message box we will give
09:17 - the extension or all the files which we
09:20 - have selected and now when I run the
09:25 - program it's showing me some error let's
09:29 - see what the error is okay so now I can
09:33 - see the
09:34 - error because I'm selecting the multiple
09:37 - files so I need a kind of a loop to
09:40 - iterate all the files so what I will do
09:43 - is I will create a for Loop
09:45 - for X is equal to
09:49 - 0
09:51 - to
09:53 - open file file dialog 1 dot file
10:00 - name dot
10:08 - count and
10:10 - then just press enter and just copy
10:15 - this message box message and in this
10:20 - file after this file
10:24 - names just pass this variable X from
10:28 - here right and this should be file names
10:32 - instead of file
10:33 - name so this is a very long code so if
10:38 - you want you can just pause the video
10:40 - and copy all the code and now when I run
10:43 - the
10:44 - program and when I click this open file
10:48 - path I can select multiple files from
10:52 - here let me select all files first and
10:56 - for example I want to choose 1 2 3 for
10:59 - by pressing control button I can select
11:02 - multiple files and when I click open it
11:05 - will show me first file which I have
11:07 - selected then it will show me the path
11:09 - of second file which I have selected
11:11 - then the path of third file and then the
11:15 - path of fourth file right so in this way
11:19 - you can also select multiple files with
11:22 - your open file dialogue
11:27 - right and I have notice that it has
11:30 - given me the error because this is
11:34 - counting from zero so we
11:37 - must minus one uh do minus one from here
11:42 - because it was counting open file dialog
11:45 - count + one because it's starting from
11:48 - zero okay so just add this minus one
11:51 - after this
11:52 - count so in this way you can use open
11:55 - file dialogue with your Visual Basic
11:58 - Windows Form ification I hope you have
11:59 - enjoyed this
