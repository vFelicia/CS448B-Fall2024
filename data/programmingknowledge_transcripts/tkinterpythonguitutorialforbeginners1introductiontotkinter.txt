00:01 - Holloway's welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge this is the first video of geo
00:06 - programming using kata in Python so in
00:10 - this video we'll be learning about a
00:12 - brief introduction to the subject of
00:14 - graphical user interface programming in
00:16 - Python so when it comes to your
00:19 - programming in Python kinder is a
00:20 - default toolkit available or a default
00:23 - library available to build some robust
00:26 - small-scale applications in Python so
00:29 - for example on creating a registration
00:32 - form and attaching it with a database
00:35 - those kind of applications so Hinda is
00:39 - not the latest and the greatest but
00:41 - there are other options too like pi qt5
00:44 - and double x by thorn for creating fewer
00:47 - applications in Python but when it comes
00:49 - to the simplicity and the ease of use or
00:54 - kinto is far more easier to use and
00:58 - create a rapid applications
01:01 - so there are multiple bindings available
01:04 - for kinto for commercial as well as on
01:09 - small small scale applications so this
01:13 - is a overview enter introduction to
01:17 - inter parking programming and I'll just
01:19 - show you a small example how to create a
01:24 - simple registration form which will be
01:26 - shown in the later videos in kinder so
01:31 - this is the basic structure of how to
01:35 - create a basic window using the kinder
01:38 - module so there are multiple ways of
01:41 - importing kinder so as deep as kinder
01:45 - comes in it comes in default like and
01:48 - default library you don't have to go to
01:50 - the process of installing firepit so
01:53 - there are multiple ways of importing
01:55 - into one of them is input inter that's
01:59 - it and the second one is from printer
02:02 - import the widgets you want for example
02:05 - if you want a entry visit or a label or
02:08 - something like button you need to
02:10 - specify that besides import and the last
02:13 - one is in both inter star so when it
02:16 - comes to star it will import every
02:18 - widgets within the window library so
02:22 - from kinder import label so here they
02:25 - are importing label with it in the inter
02:29 - window so initially we need to take a
02:33 - variable for example a bruit variable
02:36 - which is inherited in each and every
02:38 - visit we create within the printer or
02:41 - window out in the application so here we
02:45 - are taking for example a route on a top
02:49 - application and storing on
02:51 - TK e capital T and K in brackets so that
02:57 - our route variable will be headed in
03:01 - every which is we create within the
03:04 - kinder window for example if you are
03:06 - creating route variable and storing the
03:09 - kinder object within that variable we
03:13 - need to inherit over here for
03:15 - humble here the label none here we are
03:18 - inheriting none that is the root in our
03:22 - case and we are naming the label as
03:25 - hollow world so here is the example as
03:28 - you can see hollow wall is a table if
03:30 - you don't use any kind of placement
03:33 - argument such as back over here
03:35 - so PAC is one of the in Bill method for
03:39 - placing that widget within the gy window
03:43 - boy there are other methods too such as
03:45 - place and grid so what that does is that
03:49 - back cool if it doesn't take any
03:52 - argument it will take the default
03:55 - argument center and place a widget in
03:57 - the center and when it comes to place
04:00 - and grid place is based on XY
04:04 - coordinates and K is based on column
04:09 - with rows and columns so it will be
04:11 - covered in further videos and this
04:14 - widget main loop so when executing the
04:17 - printer and creating the window you need
04:21 - it is necessary that to typing main loop
04:25 - to execute that window in a proper
04:28 - manner so these are the events and
04:32 - bindings for Mouse and key events when
04:36 - it comes to Mouse based events such as
04:39 - on clicking a button or entering
04:41 - something into an entry field you can be
04:44 - used this events with the function which
04:49 - you need to get executed and when it
04:52 - comes to keyboard events these are the
04:54 - events bottom over here return is for
04:57 - enter and key shift up etcetera so this
05:01 - will be covered in the later videos and
05:04 - this is the event handling or when it
05:07 - comes to you and handling a small
05:09 - example such as if you want to if there
05:12 - is a window created with a button which
05:14 - say set quit for example if you quit
05:16 - that if you click on that button quit
05:19 - there is a function called s quit which
05:21 - is used for quitting the or exiting from
05:24 - a kinter window so if you click that
05:26 - button
05:27 - in the kinto window we'll stop executing
05:30 - and that main loop will be ended so this
05:33 - are the binding functionality which you
05:36 - can use in kinder which will be also
05:39 - covered in the further videos so these
05:42 - are the some examples of widgets which
05:44 - you can use within the kinder
05:46 - applications like example canvas check
05:49 - buttons radio buttons frame menu buttons
05:52 - panels cava etc so this is the basic
05:56 - out-group of a widget if you create it
06:00 - in kinder so let me just show you a
06:03 - small form which are three already
06:06 - created so as you can see over here this
06:09 - is small registration forms with
06:11 - multiple which is such as label entry
06:14 - field this is the radio buttons list box
06:21 - and check box and this is the button
06:24 - submit so in further videos we'll be
06:27 - looking at even handling in more depth
06:29 - when it comes to Mouse events such as if
06:32 - you click some I click the button submit
06:35 - how it interacts with the database and
06:38 - etcetera so this is how you can create a
06:41 - jungle widget application in kinter so
06:44 - some of the advantages of winter is that
06:47 - it is accessible portable and available
06:51 - as you can use those applications in
06:54 - almost any operating system available
06:57 - and the approach of creating the
07:01 - application in kinder is more in a
07:03 - layered format for example initially you
07:06 - create a route that is a parent object
07:09 - of winter then creating the widgets and
07:12 - ending into the main loop etcetera
07:16 - the some of the drawbacks of kinder is
07:19 - that when it comes to handling
07:21 - multi-threaded applications such as when
07:23 - you want to execute something or example
07:27 - if won't execute so two events at the
07:31 - same time which shows an error and it
07:34 - doesn't handle those kind of situations
07:37 - very gracefully and when it comes to
07:42 - building large applications it takes
07:44 - time to execute so it is a bit slow so
07:51 - this is the link for downloading the
07:54 - Python with a little version that is
07:57 - frequency 1.2 it is a precursor and in
08:01 - the next video we'll be looking at how
08:03 - to set up tinder in pycharm and how to
08:08 - generally create a window without
08:11 - further videos so thank you
08:15 - you
08:21 - you
