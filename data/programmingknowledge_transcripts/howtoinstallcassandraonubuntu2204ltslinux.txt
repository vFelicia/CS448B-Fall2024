00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install Apache Cassandra
00:05 - on your Ubuntu operating system
00:07 - the prerequisite of installing Cassandra
00:10 - is you need to have Java installed on
00:13 - your Ubuntu operating system so just
00:15 - verify if Java is installed on your
00:18 - Ubuntu operating system
00:19 - just open the terminal by pressing Ctrl
00:22 - alt t
00:23 - or you can just go to your applications
00:27 - and then click on Terminal which is
00:28 - going to open the terminal and here you
00:31 - can verify the version of java by just
00:34 - giving Java hyphen hyphen version
00:36 - command and if it returns some version
00:39 - of java you're good to go so now let's
00:43 - go to our browser to install Cassandra
00:46 - so just open your favorite browser and
00:48 - search for install Cassandra and the
00:52 - first link which will appear here will
00:53 - be from
00:56 - cassandra.apache.org latest getting
00:59 - started link just click on this link and
01:03 - here you have the procedure of
01:07 - installing the Apache Cassandra on
01:10 - different
01:11 - operating system or different
01:13 - distributions right
01:15 - so prerequisite here is you need to have
01:18 - Java 8 or Java 11 installed
01:23 - so you can see Oracle Java standard 8
01:26 - Edition should be installed or Oracle
01:29 - standard edition 11 should be installed
01:33 - or you should have higher version than
01:36 - these two versions
01:38 - if you don't know how to install Java I
01:41 - have already created a video on
01:44 - installing Java on Ubuntu operating
01:46 - system I can put the link of that video
01:49 - also in the description so you can see
01:52 - how to install Java once you have Java
01:56 - installed you can move down where you
02:01 - will see installing the docker image
02:03 - which we don't want installing the
02:06 - binary tarball which we don't want
02:09 - but we want to install Cassandra using
02:13 - the Debian packages right the First
02:17 - Command we have already given and
02:20 - verified that Java is already installed
02:23 - on our Ubuntu operating system so we are
02:27 - going to go to the next command which is
02:29 - this Command right so I'm going to copy
02:34 - this whole command and in my terminal
02:37 - I'm going to paste this command and then
02:39 - press enter and give my ubuntu's
02:42 - password which I used to log into my
02:45 - Ubuntu operating system now it says this
02:49 - dab is not found why this is complaining
02:52 - about this because you can see on the
02:56 - Cassandra website uh
02:59 - this command is broken into two lines
03:03 - and this doesn't work right so let's fix
03:06 - that problem so just copy this command
03:08 - once again go to any editor of your
03:11 - choice and then just go to the second
03:14 - line and then
03:16 - press backspace here and then press
03:19 - space right so now we have added this
03:24 - dab in the same line as the whole
03:28 - Command right in this web page this line
03:32 - is on one line and then we have the
03:36 - second line whole command should be on
03:38 - one line right so that's what I have
03:42 - done so I have given space and then
03:44 - added this dab in the same line copy the
03:49 - command once again and I'm going to
03:51 - paste this command once again so I'm
03:53 - going to paste this command and then
03:55 - press enter and hopefully this will work
03:58 - so once that is done I'm going to clear
04:00 - my terminal
04:02 - and then move to the next command which
04:05 - is this command so let me copy this curl
04:09 - command
04:10 - I'm going to copy this and paste it into
04:13 - my terminal and it's going to fetch
04:15 - these Keys here let's move to the next
04:18 - command which is sudo apt-get update so
04:22 - I'm going to give this command here and
04:24 - then press enter which is going to
04:26 - Simply update the package indexes right
04:29 - once that is done the last command is to
04:33 - install Cassandra which is sudo apt-get
04:35 - install Cassandra I'm going to just
04:38 - paste this command into the terminal and
04:41 - then press enter
04:42 - and then press Y and then press enter
04:46 - and it's going to start the installation
04:49 - of Cassandra so once Cassandra is
04:51 - installed it's installed as a service on
04:56 - your Ubuntu operating system right so
05:00 - you can see Cassandra installation
05:02 - command is successful so I'm going to
05:05 - clear the terminal and now first of all
05:09 - we need to enable Cassandra and then we
05:13 - need to start the Cassandra if it's
05:15 - already not started by the installation
05:18 - command so for that you can first of all
05:21 - give this command sudo system CTL
05:25 - status and then Cassandra and then press
05:29 - enter
05:31 - and you can see right now the status of
05:34 - Cassandra service is its active and
05:37 - running if you see any other status like
05:42 - it's disabled or it's stopped or it's
05:46 - not active then let me show you what you
05:49 - can do so
05:51 - instead of checking the status you can
05:53 - enable Cassandra by giving this command
05:57 - which is just enable Cassandra right
06:01 - this go this is going to enable the
06:03 - Cassandra you can see customer service
06:05 - is not a native service redirecting this
06:08 - to this one
06:10 - because Cassandra is already enabled
06:14 - this hasn't done anything in my case but
06:17 - if it's not enabled it will enable the
06:20 - Cassandra then we just need to start the
06:24 - Cassandra by just giving
06:26 - pseudo systems CTL start and it's going
06:29 - to start the Cassandra right
06:32 - once that's done you can once again
06:34 - check the status of Cassandra by using
06:37 - sudo system CTL status Cassandra command
06:40 - and if it shows active and running
06:43 - everything is working for you so you can
06:46 - start using your Cassandra cluster
06:51 - on your Ubuntu operating system right so
06:54 - now
06:56 - for configuring Cassandra so now
06:59 - Cassandra is installed the service is
07:02 - running so let me clear the terminal and
07:07 - for the configuration there is a file
07:09 - called Cassandra yaml and you can
07:14 - edit that file using sudo Nano command
07:18 - or you can use the editor of your choice
07:20 - I'm going to use G edit for now then
07:25 - forward slash
07:26 - Etc
07:28 - Cassandra and then Cassandra yaml file
07:32 - dot yaml file then press enter it's
07:35 - going to open this Cassandra yaml file
07:38 - here
07:39 - all the cluster configuration of your
07:42 - Cassandra cluster is given so cluster
07:45 - name is test cluster for now
07:47 - and then number of tokens and other
07:52 - configuration is given here right
07:55 - so you can change
07:59 - these configurations from here for
08:01 - example if you want to change the
08:03 - default Port of Cassandra right you can
08:06 - change that from here
08:08 - so this is the yaml file which you can
08:11 - use to configure Cassandra for you okay
08:15 - okay so uh you can do the configuration
08:19 - in that way now how you can interact
08:22 - with your custom.cluster
08:25 - when you install Cassandra it comes with
08:27 - cqlsh
08:30 - command utility which is Cassandra query
08:34 - shell right so just write cql as H here
08:38 - and then press enter
08:40 - is going to connect to your Cassandra
08:43 - cluster by default uh it has started on
08:48 - 9042 Port on localhost
08:51 - and here
08:53 - you are now in SQL sh shell right the
08:58 - most basic uh command is help you can
09:02 - just write help here and it's going to
09:04 - give you uh
09:06 - all the commands related to Cassandra
09:10 - which you can use so you can see uh
09:12 - create index create aggregate drop uh
09:17 - create role create key space all these
09:20 - commands are present right
09:23 - so cql is similar but not exactly same
09:29 - uh as SQL it looks like a SQL uh query
09:35 - language but it's not exactly SQL right
09:40 - so for example I'm going to just write
09:43 - help
09:45 - show and it's going to give me the
09:47 - description how I can use this show
09:50 - command so for example I can use show
09:53 - version so let me use this show version
09:56 - command and it's going to give me the
09:59 - SQL sh version Cassandra version and SQL
10:03 - spec version right I can also use this
10:07 - show host
10:09 - command and it gives me the default
10:15 - host and Port right if I want to create
10:18 - a key space I can give this command
10:22 - which is create key space and then the
10:25 - name of your key space and then you need
10:27 - to give the replication strategy for now
10:31 - I'm going to use a simple strategy there
10:34 - are various different strategies which
10:37 - you can use and the replication factor
10:39 - is one in my case I just want to test it
10:42 - right I will press enter and then this
10:45 - key space is created now in order to use
10:48 - this key space just write use and then
10:51 - the name of your key space which is test
10:54 - underscore DB in my case press enter and
10:57 - then you are inside this key space right
11:00 - so now you have created the key space
11:02 - let's create a table inside this key
11:05 - space key space is similar to a database
11:08 - now let's create a table so table
11:11 - creation command is similar to SQL
11:15 - command you can just write create table
11:18 - and then your table name let me change
11:22 - this name here because this name is not
11:25 - correct because I wanted to give
11:29 - different name this is the DB name right
11:32 - I will give test table here and then
11:35 - give this command
11:37 - so
11:39 - just copy this and paste this command
11:42 - and then it's going to create our table
11:44 - right
11:45 - then in order to insert the data you can
11:48 - use this insert into the table name and
11:52 - then your
11:55 - column names and then you have the
11:58 - values right so I'm going to just
12:00 - copy this insert command and paste it
12:03 - here and then press enter and it says
12:07 - error for Server unable to make
12:11 - int to this right so let me just make
12:15 - this int value little bit smaller and
12:18 - then once again give this insert command
12:22 - because my phone number was little bit
12:24 - bigger right
12:27 - so once that's done you can just write
12:29 - select as tricks from
12:33 - and then your table name my table name
12:36 - is test table and then press enter and
12:39 - it's going to show me my data right so
12:43 - this is how you can download and install
12:45 - and use Cassandra on your Ubuntu
12:48 - operating system I hope you enjoyed this
12:51 - video and I will see you in the next
12:53 - video
