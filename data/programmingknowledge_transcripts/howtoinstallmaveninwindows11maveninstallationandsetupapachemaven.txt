00:01 - of the mavic tutorial series uh so in
00:04 - the previous video we have talked about
00:05 - the course introduction I have given you
00:07 - some theoretical overview of the maven
00:09 - what is Maven what are the features of
00:11 - the maven and as I said you in this
00:14 - video we will be talking about the tools
00:16 - that you have to install in your PC to
00:19 - get started you uh working with the
00:21 - mavid okay so first thing first you need
00:24 - Java uh because it's a Java based uh
00:28 - tool mavin is so you require Java in
00:31 - your PC so to install Java uh you can
00:34 - just go here and in your browser and
00:37 - just write down wait
00:41 - download
00:43 - Java
00:45 - jdk okay so first thing uh first link
00:49 - will come from Oracle itself okay just
00:53 - open it and here you can see uh
00:56 - whichever operating system that you are
00:58 - using select according to according to
01:00 - that uh if you are using Windows select
01:02 - windows or Linux or Mac OS right now I'm
01:05 - using Windows 11 so I will select
01:07 - windows and I will again
01:11 - any of these three options are available
01:14 - you can download anyone uh so I like to
01:17 - install the direct installer for that
01:19 - Java and I will just click click here
01:22 - and it will start downloading the jdk
01:25 - file for my PC okay so I will not
01:29 - download it again as I have downloaded
01:32 - okay so wait a minute let me cancel it
01:36 - after uh downloading this uh wait a
01:40 - minute I will show you
01:42 - uh just in case uh it is downloading uh
01:47 - now okay so if you have if you guys are
01:50 - liking this series so do hit that like
01:52 - button and share with you share it with
01:55 - your friends who wants to learn Maven
01:56 - okay uh okay wait uh as I told you I
02:00 - have already installed jdk in my PC so
02:03 - you don't uh need to do anything or you
02:06 - just come here come at this site and
02:09 - click on the x24 x64 installer and click
02:13 - on this link it will start download the
02:15 - jdk file for for the latest version
02:18 - which is 19 for now at the time of
02:20 - recording of this lecture and that is a
02:23 - exe file that is executable file okay
02:26 - just go inside your uh
02:28 - I'm a file explorer and go inside uh
02:31 - your C drive and after C drive you can
02:35 - go inside your program files and inside
02:36 - program files you can find Java Java
02:39 - folder is being created okay after the
02:41 - installation just open the Java file you
02:44 - can see jdk 19 is here installed in my
02:47 - PC and I will just go double click on
02:50 - that folder and after in this folder uh
02:54 - as you can see bin folder is there okay
02:56 - so you you just double click on it and
02:58 - inside these all these Java files are
03:01 - jdk files are there so you just need to
03:03 - click on this address box and click Ctrl
03:07 - C so to copy this path and after copying
03:10 - this path just go come in come in your
03:12 - start and write edit
03:15 - edit okay so after writing edit you can
03:17 - see edit the system environment
03:19 - variables is uh best match comes over
03:21 - here you just click on it and this
03:24 - window will pop up and after here here
03:26 - you can click on this edit environment
03:28 - variables and so now we have two options
03:31 - you can set this environment variable
03:34 - path for the user variables like this is
03:37 - my user if you have if you are using
03:39 - multiple users in your inside your
03:41 - windows you know then you can choose
03:43 - this path so and if you are using only
03:46 - single user in your windows you can
03:49 - choose the system variable service I
03:51 - prefer system variables because in in
03:53 - some cases there are multiple users
03:56 - inside your PC then you have to create a
04:00 - that separate separate path for the each
04:02 - user so instead of creating that you
04:04 - just come over a system variables and
04:06 - click on the path
04:07 - click on edit click on new and just
04:11 - paste paste this
04:13 - okay so this path you have to paste it
04:15 - over here oh I will not pasting pasting
04:17 - as I have already done that part you
04:19 - just paste it over here click on OK and
04:22 - just to ensure
04:25 - come here here path as well click on
04:28 - edit click on new Click Cash control V
04:32 - to paste it and just say okay okay and
04:36 - okay so you have to say okay okay and
04:40 - you will get out of this window and
04:43 - after doing all these things uh you can
04:45 - see exe file is also downloaded just
04:47 - open I will show you and I will not
04:49 - install as I I literally installed in my
04:52 - PC already uh I'll just show you okay so
04:55 - here you can see it it's giving me
04:56 - message that it is already installed on
04:59 - the PC do you want to reinstall it I
05:01 - will say no you just go ahead and say
05:03 - yes yes or next next so the Java will be
05:06 - installed on your PC that's it
05:08 - okay so this is a about Java okay so
05:11 - after installing Java uh you have to
05:14 - check whether all everything is good or
05:16 - you have your path is set up and you are
05:19 - good to go for the first checklist of
05:20 - our tools so for that verification you
05:24 - just come on come on start and click
05:26 - right click and as you can see terminal
05:28 - is here you can click on that and the
05:32 - terminal will get open and you just
05:34 - write one command Java
05:36 - minus minus over
05:38 - select hit enter and it should show the
05:42 - Java version that you have installed
05:44 - right now in your PC okay so if
05:47 - everything goes fine you should see this
05:50 - message or else if there are again some
05:53 - messages where a Java is not recognized
05:55 - as a command in that case you want you
05:59 - should you have you should miss some
06:02 - steps you go back and check this video
06:04 - again and try to install again okay so
06:07 - this is for our first Tool uh the second
06:10 - tool is of course Maven you are learning
06:13 - Maven you have to install Maven in your
06:15 - PC right so click on the new tab and
06:18 - just type
06:20 - download Navin
06:23 - sorry in my typo just give me list
06:27 - okay so first link come which is
06:29 - official link from Apache
06:31 - we will just open this and after opening
06:34 - this these are the six system
06:36 - requirements uh just pause the video and
06:38 - see what are the system requirements
06:40 - that you you require as you say first
06:43 - request system requirement is jdk itself
06:45 - that we have downloaded in our first
06:46 - step so we are good to go for the jdk uh
06:50 - so there is no memory requirement uh so
06:53 - as many memory you have it's fine uh
06:56 - this requirements is there so you
06:57 - approximately 10 NP is required uh to
07:00 - Maven a solution itself so
07:02 - I guess no one is is there who doesn't
07:06 - have 10 MB of space inside this disk
07:09 - okay an operating system no minimum
07:11 - requirement uh startup scripts are
07:13 - included such as shell scripts and
07:14 - windows batch file so operating system
07:17 - you can use anyone
07:19 - okay so here you can see they have given
07:21 - four options you can download any one uh
07:25 - I personally like binary zip archive
07:27 - file so I will just come here and click
07:30 - on this link the this will download the
07:32 - Apache Maven zip file uh once installed
07:35 - I will go and
07:37 - click open when done
07:40 - or instead I will go inside my downloads
07:43 - folder I will click here okay so this
07:46 - you can see so first of all I need to
07:48 - extract this extract all
07:51 - uh I will browse just extract on like
07:55 - this
07:56 - and click on OK so it will extract
07:59 - everything what is inside that zip file
08:01 - so here you can see uh this file is
08:04 - being extracted uh I will just do one
08:08 - thing uh I will just
08:10 - cut this out and after cutting this I
08:13 - will come inside my C drive come inside
08:15 - my program files and inside my Java
08:19 - folder itself that we have seen all
08:22 - right
08:23 - program files inside Java I will paste
08:27 - that here itself okay
08:30 - I will paste it paste that extracted
08:32 - folder over here and now you have to do
08:35 - one thing we have to do is click on it
08:37 - click on bin and whatever inside is
08:40 - click on this path Ctrl C okay wait
08:45 - Ctrl C you have to copy that part and
08:48 - again come into the start and write edit
08:52 - edit edit the system where environment
08:54 - variables environment variables and just
08:57 - go inside path click on edit click on
09:02 - new and paste that path and just place
09:05 - okay and come down here and come here
09:11 - click on new
09:13 - click on Ctrl V and click OK OK
09:18 - and again okay so this part is done we
09:23 - have set the environment variables now
09:25 - after doing this we have to check
09:28 - whether everything is okay so for that
09:31 - again we have one command uh so let me
09:33 - just restart my terminal so that it
09:36 - knows the maven is installed in your PC
09:39 - okay and so the command is m v n minus
09:43 - minus
09:45 - version
09:47 - okay uh there is no and if you need to
09:51 - run this program this okay so Java home
09:54 - is a environment variable is not defined
09:57 - correctly so first let me go and rectify
10:01 - this error and I will come back okay
10:04 - okay so the problem that causes that
10:07 - Maven dot is is the internal command
10:11 - error so uh we have done all this right
10:15 - so we come into the edit we go into this
10:18 - environment variables and we are going
10:20 - inside our path we are click on edit and
10:23 - we are adding that path over here okay
10:25 - so this part this thing we have done
10:28 - correctly okay up to that I I hope you
10:31 - got this so one thing uh if you come
10:34 - over inside your terminal and just write
10:37 - mvn minus minus version and wait for a
10:42 - second okay now
10:44 - inside of a what Maven does is Maven
10:47 - come here inside our environment
10:49 - variables and check for the one variable
10:51 - name and Java home so we have to create
10:54 - that Java home variable so how to create
10:56 - it again come inside your edit and click
11:00 - come here and just click on new and set
11:04 - the variable name as Java underscore
11:09 - home
11:10 - all caps and the value should be the
11:13 - folder all right so the folder is as I
11:17 - showed you jdk 19 so don't go inside the
11:19 - bin just get this much path Ctrl C and
11:25 - get inside your variables and Ctrl V and
11:29 - just click OK after clicking OK so you
11:32 - can see one variable will got created
11:34 - over here and as that same variable you
11:37 - have to create over here as well Java
11:39 - home and this is the variable and once
11:41 - you create click on OK click on ok just
11:43 - come clear this out come inside your
11:46 - terminal and just write mvn minus minus
11:49 - version and hit enter so now I hope you
11:52 - see Apache Maven 3.9.0 and this is the
11:56 - binary code and the maven home this is
11:59 - and the Java version is also telling us
12:02 - and it is also telling us where Java is
12:04 - installed in this PC and some default
12:06 - local and platform encoding to tf8 okay
12:09 - and the OS number OS name is also
12:12 - telling us okay so this many information
12:14 - it gives you I hope you also get this
12:17 - information when when you try to run
12:20 - this command okay so we have done
12:23 - installing Maven done in short Java and
12:26 - we now again we required git okay so why
12:30 - to why to use git git is a very powerful
12:34 - word version controls management tool
12:37 - okay so you just come in here itself and
12:40 - now right
12:42 - download git and hit enter so first
12:46 - thing uh first link you see is official
12:48 - from git distributed it is the new
12:53 - distributed is the new center live okay
12:55 - so you can see it automatically detects
12:57 - your OS and gives you the link
13:00 - for your OS so once you click on the
13:03 - download for Windows uh click here to
13:06 - download the latest yes click here to
13:08 - download and it will download the 50 mb
13:11 - or file which is an executable file once
13:14 - it it got downloaded you just click on
13:17 - it uh let let the default installation
13:20 - be there click on OK OK next next this
13:23 - will install git in your PC successfully
13:26 - and once it installed it is very a
13:29 - powerful tool we will see when we are
13:33 - started using Maven and build started
13:36 - building some projects using Maven and
13:39 - Java you can see uh it is downloaded
13:42 - just click on it and go next next and
13:46 - install this tool as well okay and last
13:50 - last checklist is any IDE your
13:53 - preference you if you want vs code you
13:56 - can use vs code if you want Eclipse you
13:58 - can use Eclipse you can you can also use
14:00 - is intelligent idea which is uh I guess
14:05 - very much powerful and very good looking
14:08 - idea just my personal opinion not
14:10 - nothing else you can use your your own
14:13 - IDE all this idea comes with a built-in
14:17 - Maven
14:18 - implementation or the support you can
14:20 - see so if you have followed this all
14:23 - these tools you have installed then you
14:26 - are pretty much good to go for the next
14:28 - video and I'll see you in the next video
14:30 - and thank you for watching this video
