00:00 - now in this video we're going to learn
00:01 - about the kill command ok so already we
00:04 - have covered the PS command and the top
00:06 - command okay so in this video we're
00:08 - going to learn about how we can kill a
00:10 - particular process or you can see the
00:11 - how we can terminate a particular
00:13 - process sometimes what happens in our
00:15 - case like you open a Firefox or any
00:18 - application and it becomes unresponsive
00:19 - okay and at that time you cannot access
00:21 - that application and you cannot use that
00:23 - particular application
00:25 - so in that case you need to just you
00:28 - want to just terminate that process or
00:30 - close that application anyhow okay
00:33 - so for that purpose we can use the kill
00:36 - command and also you can normally you
00:38 - can also use that kill command okay to
00:39 - close any application or terminate that
00:41 - particular process
00:42 - so how you can do it so there is a
00:44 - separate command in our Linux system
00:46 - that is a kit
00:47 - okay so kill is the command you can use
00:51 - okay so there are the many signals
00:54 - provided by this particular command you
00:57 - can get two signals using the kill
00:59 - hyphen L option
01:01 - so here it will list all the signals
01:03 - which you can use but mostly used signal
01:06 - is the
01:08 - 15 this one signal terminate and also
01:11 - you can use the signal kill signal kill
01:14 - okay so these are the signals which are
01:16 - used mostly by the kill command to kill
01:19 - particular process so
01:21 - to demonstrate you
01:24 - I will just
01:26 - open up the Firefox using this terminal
01:30 - I will hit fire Firefox
01:34 - and Firefox will start and I will just
01:36 - enter the PS
01:40 - and psyphen a to show all the process
01:44 - so here you will see the Firefox PID
01:49 - that is 8796 okay
01:53 - so I have got the PID of Firefox okay so
01:57 - with the help of PID I can
02:00 - dominate this particular process so PID
02:03 - is 8796 okay so but there is many uh
02:07 - ways to terminate particular process you
02:09 - can just terminate that process using
02:11 - the PID as well you using third signal
02:14 - and the name of that like signal term
02:17 - single kill and also without signal so I
02:21 - will just show you each and everything
02:23 - okay so you can just to kill
02:27 - that is PID is 8796
02:30 - okay using PID or you can just do hyphen
02:33 - 50.
02:35 - okay that is 8796 so what it will do to
02:38 - just kill that particular process that
02:39 - you can see the terminated okay
02:42 - so also you can do how you can do it but
02:45 - now I will not open the uh
02:47 - Firebox I will just use CAD command cat
02:50 - home
02:51 - okay and I will just use PS cat to check
02:55 - the pad is 9405 okay so here I can use
02:59 - kill hyphen Sig signal and I will use
03:03 - Tom
03:04 - and I will just enter the
03:07 - ID number that is the 9405 and hit enter
03:10 - and you can see the that particular uh
03:14 - process terminated
03:16 - and also you can do like this also like
03:19 - a side Z without Sig you can also
03:22 - use this command so I will again use
03:25 - this one and I will first check the what
03:28 - is the process of CAD because process ID
03:30 - changes again and again that is 9417
03:33 - this time
03:34 - and I will use 9417 and you can see the
03:37 - process terminated okay so in this way
03:40 - you can use the kill command okay now uh
03:42 - now let's use some another signal also
03:45 - so if I will use psyphenl or not PS
03:49 - sorry
03:50 - funnel
03:53 - so I will use this one uh kill so let me
03:57 - check how it works I will use this so
04:00 - kill hyphen 9 and the process name that
04:04 - is the cat
04:06 - no not process name
04:09 - PID
04:12 - so 9431
04:15 - kill hyphen 9
04:18 - 431 hit enter and here you can see the
04:21 - process is killed
04:22 - okay so in this way you can use the
04:24 - skill command to terminate any process
04:26 - or kill any process so if that process
04:29 - and responsive of that any application
04:31 - is on this phone so in that case you can
04:33 - use this particular command
04:35 - okay so that's all for the today's video
04:37 - guys and I hope you liked and if you
04:38 - have any queries you can ask us in the
04:40 - comment section okay
04:41 - so I will meet you in the next video
