00:01 - hello guys are welcome to program
00:03 - acknowledge in the previous video we
00:05 - learned about how to create a basic
00:08 - window and providing image to it
00:11 - providing multiple widget status and a
00:13 - combo box introverts Labor's and buttons
00:16 - etc so let's show the output of it and
00:18 - we'll move on to the next one so this
00:22 - what we have looked in the previous
00:24 - video so if you are not familiar with it
00:26 - go ahead and check that out first or
00:29 - else you'll be lost so in this video
00:33 - we'll be looking into checkboxes radio
00:35 - buttons and the Kingdom message box so
00:39 - let's dive into it so from message box
00:43 - we'll just type in or kinter sorry mm
00:50 - import kinder message box one minute
01:00 - okay so kinder dot message box so it
01:08 - appeared and what will be two hours okay
01:13 - so this is how you can import a message
01:15 - box and let's create some check boxes
01:21 - and radio buttons right so for that you
01:23 - will have to create two more labels that
01:30 - is for gender and the language so which
01:34 - is dive into it one minute so so for the
01:40 - label fourth we'll be using
01:42 - okay we'll just type in over here so use
01:47 - this label
01:52 - copy and paste and rename it as a
02:00 - programming language language and place
02:10 - it somewhere like around 95 and 4 2 nd T
02:20 - right now we'll be using another label
02:22 - so paste it that again and we'll be
02:26 - using as agender 4 radio buttons and
02:32 - we'll also place that somewhere
02:37 - difference of 4 59 maybe and ok so let's
02:46 - see what is the output ok so it is a bit
02:51 - messed over here so as you can see and
02:56 - the buttons are overlapping ok so we
03:00 - look into that first so what we'll do
03:05 - over here is that we'll be changing the
03:07 - position of the button so we'll just
03:12 - move down and change the position of the
03:18 - buttons so we'll just change 5 1 5 that
03:24 - is 130 and Phi 1 5 and 280 I guess this
03:37 - should work so now the buttons have gone
03:43 - a bit down and we'll have to arrange the
03:46 - programming language labels ok so on the
03:52 - label ok for the programming language
03:56 - okay so 95 I will just change it around
04:02 - how about 85 maybe I guess let's check
04:09 - 87 and let's read on this so as you can
04:16 - see it is a bit aligned but we have to
04:19 - place it into the perfect position so
04:23 - let's check 80 okay now it looks a bit
04:29 - better so okay so labels are done and
04:34 - the buttons are placed at a good
04:37 - position so let's dive into creating the
04:40 - widgets right so for creating widgets
04:45 - create a variable C 1 is equal to check
04:52 - button method of kilter root comma text
05:04 - is equal to provide Java comma the
05:13 - variable
05:14 - net which we'll be using is equal to c
05:19 - VAR c 1 so for the check button 1 right
05:25 - and this course c1 being more specific
05:30 - this good or else it can get a bit
05:34 - messed up dot place so place X is equal
05:44 - to 235 and Y is equal to on to 420 right
05:55 - okay let's see whether it works or not
05:59 - save and rerun this so I guess there is
06:06 - no outputs you know I don't know what is
06:08 - the issue with this ok so there is some
06:14 - some
06:15 - arrow so the way table c1 is showing an
06:19 - error okay so as we have done before
06:22 - just mention it over here so we're
06:29 - underscore c1 is equal to a string where
06:35 - right now it will go I guess okay so as
06:41 - you can see this is a checkbox for the
06:45 - Java okay now we'll create another one
06:51 - for Python okay okay let's go down a bit
07:03 - so copy this one paste and change the
07:14 - text python change another c2 and of
07:21 - course since opposition or else it will
07:24 - be disoriented 90 and 420 will be good
07:28 - and we'll go top at the top and mention
07:34 - the c2 one right Wow c2 is equal to the
07:40 - string variable okay so this is the same
07:45 - as the intermediates really just fetch
07:48 - out or get the check box we are using
07:55 - save so these are the check boxes okay
08:06 - now we will just get into the radio
08:09 - button for the gender so for radio
08:13 - button r1 is equal to the radio button
08:23 - root and we just what it takes to
08:29 - it is equal to male comma and a variable
08:44 - for it too so re able is equal to Radio
08:56 - underscore where and we'll be using font
09:11 - or we don't require font and chest of
09:15 - the while a variable for it so here the
09:17 - value a argument will be using a
09:21 - argument called as value so what value
09:24 - you put into the radio button it will be
09:26 - used as an object for example if you
09:29 - want a value as a meal so you need to
09:32 - pass it as a string so value is equal to
09:36 - mention it as the string okay comma
09:41 - sorry dot place and same as X is equal
09:49 - to or 230 comma Y is equal to 420 we'll
10:02 - do the same for
10:11 - the female 1 and female just change it
10:17 - over here are two we have to change it
10:21 - over here too so the value for that will
10:24 - be female and place it like around the
10:30 - 90 and 60 around 60 right okay that's
10:37 - good
10:38 - and we'll be using this variable radio
10:41 - var like we done for the checkboxes
10:44 - radio ah and mentioning mentioning sorry
10:49 - is mentioned it at the top so we'll be
11:00 - seeing like let's go to the top and
11:05 - we'll be providing it over here sorry
11:08 - so radio underscore Y is equal to string
11:23 - right so for the checkboxes what I've
11:27 - noticed is that we don't need to use the
11:31 - get method but eventually we'll be using
11:33 - that but for that we have only two
11:36 - specific one that is Java and Python so
11:39 - you just mention it will do it better so
11:41 - for the vast sea one we are using Java
11:44 - and for the c2 we are using Python right
11:54 - okay so let's print out that also print
12:04 - the language which we'll be using so
12:08 - just before that create a variable valve
12:11 - is equal to sorry valve 3 is equal to
12:17 - that and let's go see one right so we
12:24 - are getting C 1 but we don't have to use
12:28 - you can use it based on your preference
12:30 - but here C 1 is already provided Java
12:33 - and C 2 is also provided as pythons you
12:35 - don't need to get it
12:36 - the value is Java and Python so that and
12:41 - for where so that's I guess that's for
12:49 - valve 3 again and that C 2 for the
12:59 - Python okay so okay so print that too
13:15 - so what we'll do over here is that we'll
13:17 - just pass three throw language is and
13:32 - for that for the gender we'll be using
13:37 - your gender is and sorry we have not
13:43 - used another variable for the radio
13:46 - button but we'll be using as where four
13:49 - is equal to radio dot where dot get okay
13:59 - so it looks in good and we'll be
14:02 - changing it over here as for so so this
14:08 - is the code and let's see what is the
14:10 - output okay so the gender is for the
14:19 - male is missing so let's check that out
14:23 - first
14:24 - oh okay okay okay what is the issue here
14:32 - so I guess there is some kind of placing
14:42 - issue but I can't see one and
15:04 - you
15:23 - okay okay I've got this but uh okay so
15:28 - for the radio button mail we are
15:33 - overlapping it I guess so it is with the
15:44 - 230 and 260 I guess okay so we just
15:48 - provide this as 260 and rerun this okay
15:53 - now that looks good okay so that looks
16:00 - in good and yeah it looks good so long
16:06 - we'll just okay so now we'll just shoot
16:11 - or show the output whether what it
16:13 - prints on the console so demo score user
16:22 - throw out some random digit for the date
16:27 - select the country this Python male so
16:36 - there is an output and the sorry though
16:40 - there is no error and the output is been
16:45 - printed so your gender is May the
16:48 - programming language is Python as we
16:50 - have selected so first name demo user
16:55 - concatenation and the date of birth is
16:57 - this the country is this from the
16:59 - combobox programming language is Python
17:02 - and the gender is male on clicking the
17:04 - sign up button so so for this and we
17:11 - have one more thing left and that is the
17:14 - message box right so for the message box
17:17 - we just need to type in the method that
17:24 - is kinder
17:28 - dot messagebox dot show info not error
17:36 - infrared and provide a title welcome
17:43 - come comma user that is also string so
17:50 - mention it into a string user is
17:56 - successfully signed up close it and
18:10 - let's see what is the output again so
18:14 - this is how you can provide a kingdom
18:16 - message box and it will be more clear
18:20 - when the output is shown so we'll be
18:23 - using another variable so user name
18:33 - sorry name to add some random digit
18:40 - select the country Python female and
18:48 - let's see sign up so this is a kinder
18:56 - message box so as you can see what we
18:59 - have provided over here that is on this
19:02 - first argument is our title sorry sorry
19:05 - for the spelling mistake but it is ok
19:11 - but the purpose has been solved this is
19:14 - the title and this is the user content
19:16 - so user is successfully signed up ok and
19:20 - this is the printed output from the
19:23 - widgets so in this video we have learned
19:27 - about the message box printer message
19:29 - box showing an output into it and how
19:34 - you can use a radio buttons and check
19:36 - box within the Pinto Pinto so this is it
19:40 - for this video guys
19:42 - and thanks for watching
