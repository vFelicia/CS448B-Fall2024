00:00 - hello and welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge so in the last row has shown
00:05 - you how to draw a simple plot using plot
00:09 - function provided by the matplotlib
00:11 - library so input is U T I'll be showing
00:14 - you how to use subplots to draw more
00:18 - than one plot and also in I will show
00:22 - you how to draw bar charts use my data
00:26 - so let me run the what we had done in
00:31 - the previous video so we're drawn this
00:34 - simple plot which has years from 1951 30
00:40 - and population and billions in y-axis so
00:45 - we had drawn for Indian population and
00:47 - Chinese population so let me show you
00:50 - how to use subplots
00:51 - I will show you how to plot two subplots
00:56 - in the same adjacent Lane so we first
01:00 - remove this xkcd function and let me use
01:04 - some styles or will use ggplot for this
01:09 - video and you can just comment out the
01:16 - plant functions plot function first the
01:22 - subplots are plotted as the way of
01:25 - matrix so if you want to plot three
01:28 - plots so what it does is 3 into 1 so
01:35 - that will be in the matrix form that is
01:37 - in the first row it will have three
01:44 - plots and it will have first look for
01:49 - subplot so like that in the matrix
01:52 - format to be like 2 & 1 3 & 3 so these
01:59 - are passed other parameters to the
02:01 - subplot function so let me just show
02:06 - switch the type reality dot support so
02:11 - in that we pass
02:13 - or first one throw and will display two
02:18 - subplots two comma first support this
02:28 - like indexing so we'll give the plot
02:33 - function now inside that will pass over
02:37 - here comma population population of
02:42 - China come on label equal to you know
02:50 - comma color will cue it is orange orange
03:00 - red will you okay so will you taught
03:05 - title that will be support of one and
03:17 - our X label valuable will give a is here
03:22 - and why level would be population
03:25 - millions so same we will type it for
03:33 - support to in that way pass one comma
03:39 - seconds of God comma 2 and we'll type
03:47 - alt dot not function in let me pass here
03:55 - common population of India comma label
04:00 - equal to
04:06 - India come on color equal to bring so
04:16 - remember we have to pass the legend
04:18 - function on top also the below the first
04:23 - subplot and we'll type title so here T
04:28 - dot title will give it is subplot to
04:37 - just copy the X label and my little fun
04:40 - talk see you and we'll be done so as you
04:48 - can see we got two subplots and in one
04:54 - we have China and another one is India
04:56 - be here yeah but you can see that one is
05:01 - little bit bigger and one is let me just
05:03 - smaller the grid function this is I
05:07 - think the due to the values which are
05:09 - passed okay so this is how you plot two
05:15 - sub plots side-by-side you can also try
05:20 - with different method like style that is
05:28 - 538 so let me see that how it looks okay
05:34 - so this will this looks really nice so
05:37 - this is 538 style
05:43 - okay so we create a new file for bar
05:48 - charts and it's concealed so it is edit
06:03 - or quit repository and I have do it for
06:08 - subplot
06:16 - we got the data from a viral mean file
06:21 - to the bar chart it is ear operation
06:27 - China India ending lines
06:43 - begins just directly plot the bar chart
06:47 - using our function in there to pass the
06:51 - same year population of India
06:56 - labor equality will pass India Kailash
07:10 - equal to three so same will copy and
07:17 - paste it here and here the pass
07:21 - population of China and make it a Polish
07:27 - ina and other way create thread so so
07:39 - you feel you now run this file really
07:44 - cared by chart like this our China bar
07:50 - chart is showing perfectly but our green
07:53 - color India's bar chart is like little
07:58 - bit showcasing this is actually
07:59 - happening because the China is China bar
08:05 - chart is all laying on top of India's
08:08 - pulcher
08:11 - let me show you
08:14 - snow for that we can use our method that
08:22 - is that uses offset to separate out the
08:28 - fellows but first what we will do is
08:31 - we'll trim down our data so we'll all
08:35 - will only contain values from 2015 25
09:01 - now it is done let me comment this out
09:06 - can turn this into a bar chart so what I
09:15 - feel on to draw a bar chart it's my
09:21 - fusion we cannot see the green one
09:27 - it is overlaid by the on this China's
09:32 - population so for that we have my third
09:36 - nor come that so for that we have to use
09:39 - something always waste so by default it
09:46 - is 0.25 I guess okay and we also have to
09:56 - pass indices variable called indices in
10:06 - that we pass the function from numpy and
10:14 - we taught a range and it should contain
10:20 - the length of our actually so it should
10:38 - contain at least
10:44 - so we are not imported numpy it's just
10:49 - an project numpy is imported and what we
10:58 - have to do is you have to pass the
11:02 - indices each and every function apart so
11:07 - the time indices here full red color
11:23 - because these indices are not properly
11:26 - set up to work with our ears in
11:32 - particular so it is just giving us the
11:35 - index from zero to ten so what we will
11:41 - do is really for first part indices -
11:51 - wait one second we'll keep it as same
11:57 - and pass with equal weight so that the
12:10 - function will know that we have changed
12:13 - the first value and also
12:42 - not required for second street below
12:58 - epilation comparison between so if you
13:12 - now okay got an error
13:17 - [Music]
13:24 - so we forgot to remove the here because
13:28 - we are already passing it through the
13:31 - indices so we remove here and also
13:36 - removing from and if we say everybody
13:40 - feel run you can say
13:46 - engage with China comparison but ears
13:49 - are still she's showing us indices so
13:52 - funded the work as a function called
14:00 - VIERA Connect sticks so in their
14:03 - computer class ticks as parameter
14:06 - further to the bus or indices variable
14:12 - comma we also pass label equal to tell
14:19 - here and if we save any filter on you
14:26 - can see ears are shown here you can see
14:32 - growth is increasing
14:37 - and it should be a turn-on who was 2022
14:42 - a 324 India is led near to China in 25
14:49 - will cost satellites so this how we plot
14:56 - our chart a vertical bar chart actually
15:02 - so I will see you in next video
