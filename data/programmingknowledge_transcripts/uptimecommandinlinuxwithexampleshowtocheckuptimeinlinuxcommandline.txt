00:00 - hello is now in this particular video we
00:02 - are going to cover about the most
00:03 - important command that is the uptime
00:05 - command okay so uh this is a very simple
00:08 - command and it will not take much time
00:10 - so let me introduce you first with what
00:13 - is this and so basically uptime is a
00:15 - command which is basically we use to
00:18 - find the how long the server is running
00:20 - okay so let's start with the
00:23 - implementation part
00:24 - so I will just hit up time oh sorry
00:28 - it's up time and here you can see it's
00:32 - 18 5151 that is 651 and up for since uh
00:39 - 34 Minute like from right now it's 6 51
00:43 - as you can see it's 652 right now
00:46 - and now it's running till uh 34 Minute
00:49 - and number of users who are logged in
00:51 - there is only one user is logged in and
00:54 - this is the average load you can see
00:56 - okay
00:57 - so to get output in a very easy way to
01:01 - understandable where this is the other
01:04 - multiple things here like uh current
01:07 - time up time okay users okay so but
01:11 - before that let me increase the font
01:13 - size I forgot to increase
01:15 - okay so I can use different options uh
01:18 - you can use iPhone S to see what are the
01:21 - options available so here you can see
01:23 - hyphen P it will show uptime in pretty
01:26 - format so let's use this and let's check
01:30 - whether output comes in pretty format or
01:32 - not
01:33 - so uptime hyphen P we are done okay so
01:36 - the server is running from
01:38 - uh it's an inference 35 minutes okay
01:42 - uh let's use another option we will use
01:45 - hyphen s
01:47 - so it's uh the time at that time was 6
01:51 - 17 okay now it's 6 53
01:54 - okay so and you can check the version of
01:57 - this uptime command using hyphen V
02:02 - okay this is something
02:05 - 3.3.17 okay
