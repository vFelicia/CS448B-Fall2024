00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how we can configure and
00:04 - download and install Jenkins on our
00:07 - Ubuntu operating system but first of all
00:10 - what is Jenkins Jenkins is an
00:13 - application that monitors execution of
00:16 - repeated jobs such as building a
00:19 - software project it can be Java it can
00:22 - be C++ or any other project and also for
00:27 - example jobs run by Kron right now among
00:31 - those things current Junkins focuses on
00:34 - building and testing software project
00:37 - continuously so in a nutshell Junkins
00:39 - provide and easy to use so-called in
00:42 - continuous integration system making it
00:46 - easier to develop to integrate changes
00:49 - to the project and making it easier for
00:52 - the user to obtain a fresh build so
00:56 - let's see how we can download and
00:57 - install Jenkins on our Ubuntu operating
00:59 - system so in order to have Junkins on
01:03 - our open to operating system you need to
01:04 - have java jdk on your open to operating
01:08 - system so first of all we will install
01:11 - java jdk so first of all open your
01:13 - terminal and I have this command which I
01:16 - will give you in the description also
01:18 - which you can copy and paste to your
01:20 - terminal and then Java JDK and JRE will
01:24 - be installed on your system so first
01:26 - command is to install a JDK which is
01:28 - sudo apt-get install open JDK - seven -
01:33 - JDK and press enter and in here just
01:36 - provide your password because we are
01:38 - using sudo here and press Enter
01:41 - it's going to install JDK so press Y
01:45 - here and allow the system to change and
01:49 - then just let it run for some time and
01:52 - JDK will be installed on your system now
01:56 - once your JDK is installed then we are
02:00 - ready to install Jenkins on our robot
02:02 - operating system but for this we need to
02:05 - have some kind of a web server which is
02:08 - a which can be Apache or nginx or any
02:13 - server of your choice you need to have a
02:16 - web server on your system in order to
02:19 - run Jenkins on it so I would prefer to
02:22 - use nginx web server for running Junkins
02:26 - but you can also use for example Apache
02:30 - - web server also right so the second
02:34 - step what I will use is I will just
02:36 - install Jenkins so I will so the second
02:43 - step is to install nginx web server
02:45 - right so I will just write sudo apt -
02:50 - get install nginx so just write engine X
02:57 - right and then press ENTER and then just
03:02 - give Y and plus enter once again and the
03:05 - engine next server will be installed in
03:08 - few seconds on your Ubuntu operating
03:10 - system so what you need to do is the
03:13 - simple process is to go to the Jenkins
03:17 - website and see what's the correct
03:19 - procedure so just write install Jenkins
03:27 - Ubuntu and press Enter and the first
03:32 - link most probably which will appear
03:34 - here will be this link which is Vicki
03:37 - dot Junkins
03:38 - - CI dot o-r-g okay so just this is the
03:42 - official website Jenkins - CI dot orgy
03:45 - is the official website and the title
03:48 - which says installing Jenkins on Ubuntu
03:50 - you just need to click this link okay
03:53 - and this is the procedure for installing
03:56 - Jenkins on your open toe ring system so
03:59 - these are the four steps which we are
04:02 - going to follow so the first step is to
04:04 - download the Jenkins files and then we
04:08 - will paste it here so just clear or your
04:11 - tumblr so just clear it and then we will
04:15 - just paste this command which is w get -
04:18 - Q - oh then this URL okay which you can
04:23 - copy from the web
04:24 - I then press ENTER and it's going to
04:27 - just download this package right now the
04:31 - second command is this one which is a
04:35 - pseudo command and I'm going to just
04:38 - copy this command and then paste it to
04:42 - my terminal once again so right click
04:44 - paste and press Enter okay so once this
04:48 - is done then we are going to do the
04:52 - third step which is sudo apt-get update
04:56 - and then press ENTER and paste it and
05:01 - press ENTER and then it's going to do
05:04 - the update and once the updates are done
05:06 - we can directly give this install
05:10 - command which is a sudo apt-get install
05:13 - command right so it's done let's give
05:17 - the sudo apt-get install Jenkins come on
05:19 - and press ENTER and then it's going to
05:22 - install Jenkins so press Y press ENTER
05:26 - so now the Jenkins is installed on our
05:30 - remote operating system I can see the
05:33 - process is done now now by default
05:35 - Jenkins will run on port 8080 of your
05:41 - you know operating system so let's see
05:43 - if it's running or not so I will open a
05:46 - web browser and I will just say for
05:49 - example one twenty seven point zero
05:52 - point zero point one which is the
05:54 - localhost you can also write localhost
05:56 - here it's the same and then port 8080
06:00 - after the colon so just write port 8080
06:02 - and press ENTER and hopefully Jenkins
06:05 - will start here so you can see the
06:09 - Junkins page here and it says unlock
06:12 - junkies to ensure Jenkins is securely
06:15 - set up by the administrator our password
06:19 - has been written to the log file right
06:22 - and this file on the server is this one
06:26 - okay so it it says please copy the
06:30 - password from either location and paste
06:33 - it here so you can
06:36 - star you can just use this command and
06:40 - you can open the terminal once again and
06:43 - I will open the fresh terminal and here
06:46 - maybe I will do the cat command
06:48 - if it allows me to do it so cat and this
06:52 - path which I have copied from here which
06:54 - is this one right which is the initial
06:56 - password and I will press enter and it
06:59 - says permission denied so I will just
07:01 - give the sudo before that so just write
07:05 - sudo cat and this this location and give
07:09 - you a password and this will be the
07:11 - initial password for this right so I
07:16 - will just copy this password which is
07:19 - the initial password given to us which
07:22 - is at this location so you can just cat
07:24 - this file and then get the password I
07:28 - will just paste this password here and
07:30 - then press Continue here okay and I will
07:33 - say remember password why not and now
07:36 - it's going to start Jenkins let's see
07:39 - what happens next
07:40 - okay now the next step here is this step
07:47 - which says plug in extend Jenkins with
07:50 - additional features to support many
07:53 - different needs for now I will choose
07:55 - this one which is install suggested
07:58 - plugins and I will just press this
08:02 - button and it's going to install the
08:04 - suggested plugins for me right it will
08:07 - install for example gate and you can see
08:12 - different kind of you know plugins it's
08:14 - installing so you can see the name of
08:18 - these plugins and the process for the
08:21 - installation and once everything is done
08:24 - everything will be green we will be
08:26 - ready for the next step right now once
08:32 - everything is installed you can see this
08:37 - you know interface which says a create a
08:39 - first admin user so in here what we are
08:43 - going to do here is
08:45 - you will give the username for example I
08:47 - will give the username code bind right
08:51 - and the password so the password you can
08:54 - you know change here right so our
08:57 - initial password we have seen using this
09:01 - location and in this file but you can
09:04 - change this password now you have chance
09:06 - to change it so I will change this
09:08 - password and I will confirm my password
09:11 - and then the first name for example code
09:16 - bind and the email address for example
09:20 - info at the rate code bind calm okay and
09:28 - then I will just save and finish or I
09:32 - will just continue as an administrator
09:35 - this is also an option so let's see what
09:38 - this offers us so I will just say
09:40 - continue as our admin and it's saying
09:46 - Jenkins is ready your junk is setup is
09:49 - complete so start using Jenkins so I
09:51 - will just you know click this button
09:54 - which they start using Jenkins and now
09:59 - this will be the first interface which
10:01 - will be presented by Jenkins for you
10:04 - okay so now you already have your you
10:07 - know username and password you already
10:10 - created and if you want to you know
10:14 - manage Jenkins you can just go here
10:16 - manage Jenkins and in here you have a
10:19 - configure system and the other you know
10:24 - configurations you can change it from
10:27 - here also right so for example I will
10:30 - just click this one which is configure
10:33 - go global security and let's see what it
10:37 - has inside so it's going to open the
10:41 - global security page and in here we can
10:47 - see that our security is already enabled
10:51 - and we already created a user which is
10:55 - for us at
10:57 - user so by default this option is
11:00 - selected which is Jenkins
11:01 - own user database and logged in user can
11:07 - do anything so because I'm logged in I'm
11:10 - allowed to do anything and then if I
11:14 - want to you know allow some other users
11:16 - to create the account I can just check
11:19 - this checkbox and save the configuration
11:22 - and then whenever whoever has this URL
11:26 - of my web server he can you know open
11:30 - this and he can create his account and
11:32 - then he will be able to use Jenkins also
11:35 - but after allowing the user to create
11:38 - their account and when you are sure that
11:40 - you don't want the user to create their
11:42 - account you can just uncheck this button
11:45 - and save the configuration once again
11:47 - okay so this is the basic you know
11:50 - security configuration you can do now in
11:53 - here you can see enter the name of the
11:58 - project so if you want to create a
12:00 - project once again I will go to here and
12:03 - you can either press this button which
12:06 - says a create a new job or you can just
12:08 - say new item so I'm going to press
12:11 - create new job and then for example my
12:15 - new project this is the name of my
12:20 - project for example and this says the
12:22 - project which is freestyle project so I
12:24 - will choose this option which says
12:25 - freestyle project and then I will click
12:28 - OK so now my freestyle project will be
12:32 - created in sample moment and I will be
12:36 - able to see this freestyle project with
12:39 - the project name so now you can see this
12:46 - freestyle kind of project and then you
12:49 - are you know ready to configure Jenkins
12:53 - you can use Jenkins for example because
12:56 - it's a freestyle project so it allows me
12:59 - to choose the source code management
13:02 - system it can be get hub or git or
13:05 - subversion and then we have the build
13:08 - trigger build environment here
13:11 - and other you know settings so the
13:14 - purpose of this video is to just show
13:17 - you how we can you know just install
13:20 - Jenkins not to use Jenkins more so I
13:25 - think this purpose is done for this
13:28 - video so maybe in the future videos I
13:31 - will show you how you can you know
13:33 - configure Jenkins and configure projects
13:36 - on Jenkins so I hope you've enjoyed this
13:38 - video please rate comment subscribe and
13:40 - bye for now
