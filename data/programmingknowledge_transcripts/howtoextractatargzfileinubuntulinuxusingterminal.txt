00:02 - show you how you can extract art our God
00:04 - geez that file in Ubuntu Linux using
00:08 - terminal so for example I have this
00:10 - sample dot tar.gz file and I want to
00:13 - extract it using terminal how can I do
00:16 - it let's see so first of all open your
00:19 - terminal and navigate to the folder
00:21 - where your zip file is so mine is in the
00:25 - home folder so I will just lift out this
00:29 - folders in my home folder and this tower
00:34 - file I want to extract so to extract you
00:37 - just need to give this command dar - X
00:42 - we said F and the name of your tar file
00:46 - which is sample dot dot dot GZ in my
00:49 - case okay now in here this X stands for
00:53 - extract so extracting the tar file V
00:57 - stands for verbose so when you execute
01:00 - this command it will go it's going to
01:02 - give you the output what's happening in
01:05 - which file it's extracting Z is used for
01:09 - this gzip extension so if you have gzip
01:14 - extension in your tar file then you may
01:18 - want to use this and this F stands for
01:21 - file so this file tells the name and
01:24 - path of the compressed file ok so just
01:28 - give this command and then press ENTER
01:31 - and it's going to extract your tarde sip
01:35 - file or GZ file and then when again when
01:38 - you list your folders and files in here
01:43 - you will see the same name folder as
01:46 - your tar file name so might our file
01:48 - name was sample and you will see the
01:51 - same name folder which is extracted from
