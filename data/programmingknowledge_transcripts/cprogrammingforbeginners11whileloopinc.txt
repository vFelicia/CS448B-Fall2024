00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on C programming for beginners
00:05 - and in this video we are going to see
00:08 - how we can use Loops in C and we will
00:12 - start with while loop how to use while
00:15 - loop in C
00:17 - programming now first of all what are
00:20 - while Loops so or even uh you may be
00:24 - wondering what are even Loops in C now
00:28 - as the name suggest Loop loop loop is a
00:32 - piece of uh code which will execute
00:37 - again and again and again until and
00:39 - unless some condition is true okay now
00:44 - for example we want to print the values
00:49 - of of integer from uh 0 to 10 and we
00:54 - don't want to use print F again and
00:57 - again to print uh you know print print
01:00 - one print two or print F1 print F2 print
01:03 - F3 instead of that we want just want to
01:06 - use one line of uh code print F and we
01:10 - want to print from 0 to
01:14 - 10 uh using the single line of uh code
01:19 - which is print F we can do it by using Y
01:23 - Loop okay so a loop is uh something
01:28 - which executes use your code again and
01:32 - again and again until and unless some
01:35 - condition is true now how to use while
01:39 - loop so let's uh use the same example uh
01:44 - to print 10 numbers so I will declare
01:48 - int I is equal to 0 as my variable and
01:54 - then I want to
01:56 - print number or integers from 0 to 10 or
02:00 - 0 to 9 itself
02:04 - so while I can use while loop by this uh
02:09 - keyword while and then comes your
02:12 - condition and then comes your curly
02:15 - braces and inside those curly braces
02:18 - comes your condition so inside our while
02:22 - loop we want to print uh the integer 10
02:26 - times right so print f and then we will
02:35 - say
02:37 - value of I is equal to percentage d
02:43 - right comma I okay and in this uh in
02:50 - these brackets comes your condition okay
02:55 - so we will check whether I is less than
03:01 - less than 10 if I is less than 10 then
03:05 - we want to uh execute this code okay and
03:10 - if this I whenever it goes greater than
03:14 - 10 or like this we want to uh go out of
03:19 - this Loop okay so this is or this
03:24 - bracket of while is evaluating our
03:28 - condition okay now we will just give the
03:31 - semicolon to our code and then we will
03:34 - increment the value of I like this I is
03:38 - equal I + 1 okay this expression I is
03:44 - equal to I + 1 you can write in short by
03:48 - writing I
03:50 - ++ okay so there are two ways of
03:54 - incrementing the value of I like this I
03:57 - is equal to I + 1 or you you can do I ++
04:00 - it's same as I equal to I + 1 so we will
04:04 - use I ++ for now
04:07 - okay and then let's uh try to compile
04:11 - our code so what it's doing it's
04:16 - checking this condition if this
04:19 - condition is true it will print this but
04:22 - because I will never be true because
04:27 - first of all I is equal to zero and this
04:30 - condition in this case what I have
04:32 - written will never be true I is equal
04:34 - to0 which is not greater than 10 then
04:39 - this Loop will never be executed while
04:45 - why because this condition is uh not
04:48 - true at the first place so this code
04:50 - will not execute okay so let's see what
04:54 - happens when we compile and run the
04:56 - code and nothing happens and this is
05:00 - what we were expecting but when we
05:04 - check I is less than 10
05:09 - then because the value of I is equal to
05:12 - zero it goes to uh this while and it
05:15 - goes to check this condition whether 0
05:18 - is less than 10 and it will say yes 0 is
05:21 - less than 10 then execute this code
05:24 - which will print zero and then increment
05:28 - the value of I by One which is 0 + 1 is
05:31 - equal to 1 and then it will do it again
05:34 - and again until this condition is met so
05:38 - let's try compile and run the
05:42 - program and we can see the value of I is
05:46 - equal to 0 value of I is equal to 1 but
05:48 - I forgot to give the line break so we
05:52 - will give this line break from
05:55 - here and then once again we will run the
06:03 - code like this so it has printed value
06:07 - of I is equal to0 in the starting and
06:10 - then value of I is equal to 1 then value
06:13 - of I is equal to 2 3 4 until I is equal
06:18 - to 9 okay so what's happening
06:23 - here at the first place the value of I
06:27 - we have declared it as zero so it goes
06:30 - to a y Loop and it checks this condition
06:33 - that 0 is less than 10 so it goes inside
06:40 - this Loop because the condition is true
06:42 - and it prints this message value this
06:46 - should be value of I is equal to
06:50 - whatever the value of I I is zero right
06:52 - now so it will print I is equal to 0 and
06:56 - then we are increasing the value of I by
06:58 - 1 right right I ++ is equal to I equal
07:01 - to I + 1 so now the value of I becomes 1
07:06 - and it goes once again to check this
07:08 - condition whether I is less than 10 so I
07:12 - the value of I is equal to 1 Which is
07:14 - less than 10 once again it will print
07:17 - value of u i is equal to 1 and increment
07:20 - the value of I by one which is two once
07:24 - again it goes again and again until and
07:27 - unless I becomes 10
07:30 - here so when I becomes 10 here it will
07:34 - go here and see 10 is not less than 10
07:38 - so it will not print any code here
07:41 - because this condition is not true and
07:44 - then it goes out of the loop so this is
07:47 - what happening in this code right so
07:50 - once again run this
07:53 - code and it will run uh and it will
07:57 - print 0 to 9 now for example you want to
08:01 - print until 10 we can just write if I is
08:05 - less than or equal to
08:08 - 10 then print this code so this
08:12 - expression is I is less than r equal to
08:16 - 10 okay so run the program and now this
08:20 - prints from 0 to 10 okay so once again a
08:27 - loop is something
08:29 - which iterates or executes your code
08:34 - again and again until and unless some
08:37 - condition is true so in in this in the
08:40 - case of while loop the condition is this
08:43 - thing we have
08:45 - provided and it will execute again and
08:48 - again until and unless this condition is
08:51 - met okay so I hope you have enjoyed this
