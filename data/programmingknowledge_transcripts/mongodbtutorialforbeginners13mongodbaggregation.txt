00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - mongodb database tutorial for beginners
00:05 - in this video we will learn about
00:07 - aggregation in mongod DB so first of all
00:11 - what is
00:12 - aggregation aggregation operation groups
00:15 - values from multiple documents together
00:18 - and can perform a variety of operations
00:21 - on the grouped data and it's going to
00:25 - return a single result after the
00:27 - aggregation now if you have used the uh
00:30 - SQL relational databases if you uh know
00:34 - when you have whenever you give the
00:36 - query for example select count and in
00:39 - the bracket estx this count is for
00:42 - aggregation and this count will return
00:45 - you the number of rows right in the same
00:48 - way uh the
00:50 - aggregation function Works in mongod DB
00:54 - now how we can uh perform this
00:57 - aggregation in mongod DB let's see
01:00 - so I'm going to use uh you know Windows
01:03 - command prompt for uh this video so I'm
01:06 - going to switch to and then press
01:10 - enter and in here I will switch to my
01:13 - students uh collection in the school
01:16 - database so I will just write use
01:21 - school and we are switch to school and
01:25 - first of all let's see what data we have
01:27 - in the school so I'm going to just write
01:30 - DB
01:31 - [Music]
01:32 - dot students
01:36 - doind and let's print
01:40 - this and we have this much amount of
01:43 - document inside our database right and
01:47 - if you notice I have added this gender
01:50 - field also to the documents if the
01:54 - student is male or female right now to
01:58 - uh perform aggregation what we need to
02:00 - do is we need to just write DB then dot
02:06 - The Collection name for example students
02:10 - something like this and then use the
02:14 - command called Aggregate and inside
02:17 - these uh round bracket give first of all
02:20 - uh these square brackets and then once
02:23 - again the the curly brackets and inside
02:27 - the curly brackets first of all we will
02:30 - give the aggregate operation so what can
02:34 - be our aggregate operation for example
02:37 - we want to group the student on the
02:39 - basis of male and female so we want to
02:43 - count how many female students we have
02:46 - and how many male students we have so we
02:49 - can just write
02:52 - dollar group here and then give a colon
02:57 - and once again give these curly brackets
03:00 - s and here in these curly brackets we
03:03 - will give the condition on the basis of
03:06 - which we want to group the students so
03:08 - we want to group on the basis of uh ID
03:13 - and what we want to uh group we want to
03:16 - group gender so just in the double
03:19 - course just write dollar this is
03:22 - important just write dollar and then
03:26 - gender which is the name of your fee
03:29 - field right so just write gender which
03:32 - is same as this field in your uh Json
03:36 - document you can see here right and then
03:41 - once we have given that we need to
03:43 - specify the format of result so after
03:47 - comma the next argument will be the
03:49 - result and here the first keyword you
03:52 - can Define on yourself so for example
03:56 - you can just say
03:58 - my result
04:00 - or something like this you whatever word
04:03 - or keyword you want to uh see in the
04:07 - answer you can just give that word and
04:10 - then colon and then once again curly
04:13 - brackets and inside the curly bracket
04:16 - what we want to do what operation we
04:18 - want to perform here we can perform sum
04:22 - minimum maximum average and other
04:25 - operations here so we are going to
04:27 - perform some for now so just write
04:30 - dollar sum and then just give Co colon
04:34 - and then give here true or one right and
04:39 - then we are going to perform this uh
04:42 - command so press enter and it returns US
04:45 - male number of male we have three males
04:48 - and three females in our documents
04:53 - right now for example we want to find
04:56 - the maximum and minimum age of uh
05:00 - students inside our documents how we can
05:04 - do it so in here we will pass the same
05:07 - query but instead of my result for
05:10 - example we can say max
05:14 - age for the result and then instead of
05:17 - using sum we can use uh Max here so just
05:21 - write Max and instead of true we can
05:25 - pass the field which we want to perform
05:30 - the operation on so for example we want
05:32 - to perform this operation on age we want
05:35 - to find the maximum age right so just
05:38 - give in double quotes uh this age uh
05:41 - field and then press enter and it
05:44 - returns us error because I think I
05:46 - forgot to give the dollar symbol before
05:50 - age so just give dollar age don't forget
05:53 - the dollar symbol here and press enter
05:55 - once again and you can see here the
05:59 - maximum maximum age for male is 40 here
06:02 - and maximum age for female is 17 here
06:06 - right and similarly we can do the
06:10 - minimum age operation so Min age and
06:14 - here you just need to write Min and
06:17 - press uh enter and once again it gives
06:20 - us error because instead of uh typing
06:23 - Min I typed mix so just once again we
06:28 - will correct this uh operation Min and
06:32 - then press enter and it returns us the
06:34 - minimum age of uh male is 13 and minimum
06:39 - age of female is 12 here okay so in this
06:43 - way you can perform aggregation in
06:45 - DV I hope youve enjoyed this video
