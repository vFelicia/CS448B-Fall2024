00:01 - right so for Simplicity let's reduce our
00:05 - Constructor which only takes uh this
00:09 - context okay and as you can see here the
00:13 - super class uh we can just give the name
00:17 - of our database so our database name is
00:21 - this variable pass it here third is
00:24 - Factory we are going to pass null here
00:28 - and the version for example version is
00:30 - equal to one now whenever this
00:33 - Constructor is called your database will
00:37 - be
00:38 - created okay now in order to create the
00:42 - table inside your
00:45 - database we are going to create a table
00:49 - whenever this oncreate method of this
00:53 - class is called okay so you can see sqi
00:57 - database class is the argument ment
01:00 - inside on create right so we can just
01:03 - take this uh DB which is a variable of
01:06 - escolite database dot
01:11 - execute site or exact esite or
01:18 - sq so take this uh instance DB and call
01:23 - a method called
01:27 - dot exact SQL and what it does is it
01:32 - executes whatever query you pass inside
01:36 - this
01:37 - uh method as an argument so it takes the
01:43 - string variable or a string query so
01:46 - here you can prepare your create table
01:50 - query and then whenever it's called it's
01:53 - going to execute this query and it's
01:55 - going to create this table okay so let's
01:58 - write our query for for
02:00 - example
02:04 - create the table name so create
02:08 - table and the table name in our case is
02:12 - this one so you can use this
02:15 - concatenation operator to concatenate
02:18 - this and
02:20 - then inside your brackets your column
02:24 - names comes right so First Column name
02:27 - is ID or you can and just take these uh
02:33 - these names column one column two column
02:35 - 3 and column four here so inside double
02:39 - Cotes and Plus+ you can write column
02:43 - one and then let's uh write our query
02:47 - first and let's uh forget about these
02:50 - variables so let's understand first how
02:53 - this query is written and then we can
02:56 - insert these variables here okay so so
03:00 - just write create table and your table
03:03 - name and then in the brackets comes the
03:07 - ID which is uh the First Column name and
03:10 - then comes the attributes of this uh
03:13 - column so it will be
03:18 - integer and it's going to be my primary
03:25 - key P primary key means the unique key
03:29 - which you will be able to uh identify
03:32 - the tail rows okay and then it's going
03:36 - to
03:39 - Auto increment Auto increment means it's
03:43 - going to increment automatically even if
03:45 - you don't provide any data for it okay
03:49 - the second column name is name itself
03:53 - and the attribute or the data type for
03:55 - this is text for example the third
03:59 - column will will be
04:02 - surname and the data type is text for it
04:07 - also and the fourth uh column is uh the
04:11 - marks
04:12 - column so
04:15 - marks and let's create it as integer so
04:20 - we have created a table using this query
04:24 - so this query is create table and your
04:26 - table name is student table and in the
04:29 - brackets we have provided four columns
04:31 - to it ID which is a primary key and it's
04:34 - going to Auto increment name which is a
04:37 - text surname which is a text and marks
04:41 - which is uh integer data type okay now
04:45 - one more thing uh which uh we can do is
04:49 - in the upgrade method we can once again
04:53 - call this exact SQL so this is the
04:58 - object we can use do
05:01 - exact
05:02 - xsql and in here we can just uh drop our
05:07 - table if it exist in case of
05:10 - upgradation
05:12 - so
05:13 - drop
05:19 - table
05:23 - if exist and the table name is this one
05:28 - so you can just
05:31 - copy and paste like this
05:34 - okay and once again we are going to
05:37 - create uh this table so you can now
05:41 - directly call on create here on Create
05:44 - and pass this DB uh instance now once
05:49 - this is done what we are going to do is
05:52 - this is just for checking uh we are
05:54 - going to write a single line of code so
05:57 - that our database is created and the
06:00 - table is created also so just go to the
06:05 - Constructor once again in here and just
06:09 - create an instance of escolite database
06:12 - which is the same as this and we will
06:15 - name it as DB is equal to this dot get
06:22 - writable database okay and what it's
06:25 - going to do is it's going to create your
06:28 - database and table
06:30 - and in next video we are going to remove
06:33 - this uh line we because we are going to
06:35 - write our code to inserts the data into
06:39 - the database so this is just for
06:41 - checking now database helper code is
06:44 - done I think just one more little change
06:48 - which I would like to do is this key
06:51 - spelling is wrong it should be k y
06:54 - instead of k a y and now what we are
06:57 - going to do is we are going to uh take
07:00 - this database helper class and create an
07:03 - instance of this database helper class
07:05 - in our main activity. Java class so copy
07:09 - this class name go to your main
07:11 - activity. Java file and create an
07:15 - instance so write the name of your class
07:17 - and the instance name for example my
07:21 - DB and now in our on create method of
07:26 - main activity. Java file you can just
07:30 - create a new instance so my DB
07:34 - new and then new database helper okay
07:39 - and this takes one argument which is the
07:42 - context so you can just write this and
07:46 - everything will be fine now once
07:49 - everything is done what it's going to do
07:51 - is it's going to call the Constructor of
07:53 - this database helper class and what we
07:57 - are doing in the Constructor in in the
07:59 - Constructor we are creating the database
08:02 - right and the table okay so once this
08:05 - Constructor is called this code is
08:08 - called and it's going to create the
08:10 - database and the table for you okay so
08:13 - let's run our
08:16 - program now our app is running so you
08:20 - can see this uh activity which is blank
08:22 - activity and it's uh not going to do
08:25 - anything right now but what it has done
08:28 - is once this activity is invoked it's
08:32 - going to call your on create method in
08:35 - your main activity and in turn it's
08:38 - going to call this uh Constructor and
08:41 - this Con Constructor is going to create
08:43 - your database and your table inside your
08:47 - database now to check whether your
08:51 - database is created or not how you can
08:54 - check uh and where where is the location
08:57 - of this database so let's see uh where
09:00 - can we find this database so go to your
09:03 - Android studio and in here go to this uh
09:08 - tab called tool and then go to Android
09:13 - and click Android device
09:16 - monitor okay so click Android device
09:19 - monitor and once your Android device
09:22 - monitor is open you will be able to find
09:25 - your uh project name in here so my
09:29 - project name or my app name is site app
09:33 - and I can find my app here you can see
09:36 - site app okay once you select this go to
09:41 - the right hand side and in here choose
09:44 - File Explorer from from here okay and in
09:47 - this file explorer go to the category
09:50 - called data and open it and once again
09:54 - search for the category called Data so
09:57 - data go to data and inside data there
09:59 - will be a folder once again called Data
10:02 - so go inside that folder open this
10:04 - folder and now you can find your app
10:07 - name here also so my app name is site
10:11 - app I can see here and I will go open
10:15 - this uh folder here and I can see a
10:19 - folder called database and inside this
10:21 - database I can see my database name
10:25 - which is student. DB so now I know that
10:30 - my database is
10:32 - created now if you are more curious
10:35 - about uh you know seeing inside this
10:39 - database and uh you want to see uh if
10:41 - the table is really created or not or uh
10:45 - if once uh we going to insert some data
10:48 - you want to see the data if it's there
10:50 - or not uh I will show you a simple trick
10:54 - which will help you you can export this
10:58 - uh database to your local PC okay so
11:02 - right now it's in your Android device so
11:05 - you can export this database on your PC
11:09 - and then you can uh you know query this
11:12 - database or you can see inside this
11:14 - database uh what's inside this database
11:17 - okay so this is just for checking the
11:19 - content of your database by transferring
11:22 - this database to your local PC and see
11:25 - what's inside it so just select your
11:27 - database
11:29 - in my case student. DB and you will be
11:32 - able to see this small button here which
11:35 - uh says pull a file from a device so
11:38 - click this and it's going to open a file
11:41 - explorer and then you can select your um
11:46 - choose chosen uh location and save it on
11:51 - your chosen location for example I'm
11:53 - going to save it on the desktop and it's
11:56 - going to save it there and then what you
12:00 - can do is you can uh you know if you
12:03 - have skite installed on your windows you
12:05 - can just open your terminal and you can
12:10 - see inside this um database one uh more
12:15 - helpful tool I'm going to show you in
12:18 - order to uh see inside this database and
12:22 - this tool is called sqlite manager which
12:25 - is a Firefox plug-in so if you have a
12:28 - Firefox browser it's going to help you a
12:31 - lot what you can do is you can uh open
12:34 - your Firefox browser and go to the
12:37 - settings here and go to
12:39 - add-ons and search for add-on
12:43 - called escolite and it's going to search
12:47 - for uh this escolite manager manager
12:51 - 0.8.3 you just need to install it just
12:54 - install it and then restart your uh
12:57 - browser and and once your browser is
13:01 - restarted you can go to settings once
13:04 - again and then go to customize here and
13:08 - in here you will be able to see this
13:10 - tool esite manager you can draw drag and
13:13 - drop this in to your uh you know tools
13:18 - here and then exit
13:21 - customize and now you will be able to
13:23 - open this from here so just open
13:26 - escolite manager click okay and now you
13:29 - can browse your database so my database
13:33 - is on the desktop and make sure you
13:36 - select all files from here okay so you
13:38 - will be able to see this DB file okay so
13:42 - select all files from here and select
13:45 - your database and open and now you can
13:48 - see this database and there is a table
13:51 - called student table which we have
13:53 - created and this table is containing
13:57 - four columns ID name surname and marks
14:00 - coded by the student okay and you can
14:05 - browse the type integer text text
14:07 - integer which we have provided and our
14:10 - ID is a primary key you can see so the
14:14 - database content you can see using this
14:17 - site manager okay so this is a simple
14:21 - little trick which you can
14:23 - use so that's it for this video and in
14:27 - the next video I'm going to show you how
14:29 - you can uh insert data into your sqlite
14:33 - database using Android I hope you have
14:35 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
14:37 - and subscribe and bye
