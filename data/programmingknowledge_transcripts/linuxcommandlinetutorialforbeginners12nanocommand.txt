00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:06 - we can use Nano command in Linux now
00:10 - Nano is a small and friendly text editor
00:14 - and beside the text editing Nano offers
00:18 - many extra features like an interactive
00:21 - search or replace and it also has some
00:25 - other features like go-to line or column
00:28 - number it can show or it can you know
00:31 - give you the indentation in the file or
00:34 - some other features so let's see how we
00:38 - can use it so first of all I'm going to
00:41 - just change my directory to desktop and
00:45 - in here for example I want to create a
00:48 - new file
00:48 - first of all Nano can be used for
00:51 - creating a new file also so just write
00:54 - Nano and then you just need to write the
00:58 - name of your file for example file dot
01:01 - txt I want to create this file right and
01:04 - I will press ENTER and then this is
01:07 - going to open this file and create this
01:12 - file in the terminal right now you may
01:18 - observe here that the file is open but
01:23 - it's not you know shown here okay so
01:28 - this file is not shown because we
01:30 - haven't saved the file so Nano has
01:33 - created a file for us but we need to
01:36 - save it in order to you know see it here
01:39 - on the desktop because we are in the
01:41 - desktop right now right so for example
01:43 - we write something here for example ABC
01:46 - and for example b c d and e FG for
01:51 - example some random text okay now in
01:54 - order to save this text inside this file
01:57 - dot txt what you need to do is you need
02:00 - to press ctrl o ok you can see this
02:04 - command is given here which means write
02:07 - out ok so when you press ctrl o it means
02:12 - write out that
02:13 - means writing out to the file so just
02:16 - press ctrl oh and this ctrl o will give
02:20 - you this kind of information which says
02:24 - file name to write and the name of the
02:27 - file so our file name is file dot txt
02:30 - which is okay so you just need to press
02:33 - ENTER and it's going to save the content
02:37 - of the file and as soon as I press ENTER
02:40 - you can see file dot txt is created here
02:43 - and when I open it is going to show the
02:46 - content of the file which we have
02:48 - inserted using nano right now Nano has
02:52 - some other controls for example control
02:57 - G will get the help or control X when
03:00 - you press the control X is going to exit
03:03 - from the Nano command so let's press
03:05 - control X first so I'm going to press
03:07 - control xed and we are out of the Nano
03:10 - c'mon once again once the file is
03:13 - created then we can added the content of
03:16 - the file by the same common Nano and the
03:19 - file name and you can see we have
03:22 - written this content to our file and now
03:24 - for example I want to add it so I will
03:26 - go to this line for example and you can
03:30 - see there is a command called control K
03:34 - for cut right normally and the normal
03:39 - editors we have control C for control X
03:43 - for cutting and control you know V for
03:47 - pasting right but in here we have
03:50 - control key for cutting a line for
03:54 - example so I will just press control K
03:57 - it's going to cut this line and for
04:00 - example I want to go down and paste it
04:02 - here I can press control you you can see
04:06 - this command which is control you which
04:09 - stands for uncut so whatever you have
04:11 - cut I will press control you you can
04:14 - paste it like this okay and then press
04:16 - control o to save the content which is
04:19 - going to ask you if you want to save it
04:21 - when you press ENTER the file content
04:25 - will be
04:26 - and you can see the effects here and you
04:30 - can see like this
04:31 - okay so nano can be used to create you
04:37 - know a different kind of files and for
04:41 - example I will just exit from this menu
04:45 - command and for example I want to create
04:47 - a C++ file so I will just press nano and
04:51 - I will just say a b c dot cpp for c++
04:58 - file right
04:59 - cpp is the extension of c++ file and
05:02 - when i press enter and in here for
05:06 - example i want to write some code so i
05:08 - will just write the IAO stream for
05:14 - example and we need to include it right
05:18 - so hash include iostream and you can see
05:23 - here it's giving us the color so nano
05:28 - has already recognized that it's a CPP
05:30 - file so it's going to show you the code
05:35 - highlighting for your CPP code right so
05:39 - here I can just write int mean and then
05:44 - I can just give these curly brackets and
05:48 - for example I want to print something so
05:51 - I can just say hello world by STD C out
05:58 - hello world in the double quotes right
06:02 - and you can see it's doing the
06:06 - highlighting for us so Nano is good for
06:12 - you know editing some you know files
06:16 - which contains some code so it can
06:18 - recognize if the file is a CPP file or C
06:22 - file or Java file or different kind of
06:24 - files okay and it will do the
06:27 - highlighting or code highlighting for
06:29 - you also and it can recognize these code
06:34 - files also that's why also Nano is
06:38 - you know beneficial to use whenever you
06:41 - want to add it some kind of code right
06:44 - so this is how you can use Nano c'mon I
