00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can use Visual Studio code
00:05 - to run SQL queries from within your
00:08 - Visual Studio code editor in this
00:10 - particular example I'm going to use
00:12 - MySQL server so I'm going to show you
00:14 - how you can connect to mySQL server
00:17 - using your Visual Studio code how you
00:20 - can create tables insert data and fetch
00:24 - data using visual studio code itself in
00:28 - addition this method you can use to
00:30 - connect to any other popular SQL Server
00:33 - Like postr SQL or Microsoft SQL server
00:37 - or any other popular SQL Server so let's
00:40 - see how we can do it so first of all we
00:43 - need to install the required extension
00:47 - to connect to our SQL server in our case
00:51 - the MySQL so I'm going to go to the
00:54 - extensions section and here search for
00:57 - SQL tools and you will be be able to see
01:00 - this popular extension which is called
01:03 - SQL tools and this SQL tool helps us to
01:07 - manage our SQL database when you scroll
01:11 - down here you will be able to see uh
01:14 - different databases which it supports so
01:18 - we are going to install this extension
01:20 - first of all so I'm going to click on
01:21 - install which is going to install this
01:24 - extension and once this extension is
01:26 - installed you will be able to see the
01:28 - disable or unable install Button as soon
01:31 - as this extension is installed you will
01:34 - be able to see this database icon and
01:37 - when you hover over this database icon
01:39 - it says SQL tools so I'm going to click
01:41 - on this uh SQL tools icon and you will
01:45 - be able to see this kind of section here
01:49 - so let me close uh this window here and
01:52 - let's create a new connection so I can
01:54 - click on this add new connection here
01:57 - but when you click on this uh new
02:00 - connection you will see a blank space
02:02 - here this is because we have installed
02:06 - the SQL tools extension but in order to
02:09 - connect to a particular SQL Server you
02:12 - need to install the driver extension for
02:15 - that also so as in our case we are using
02:19 - MySQL so I'm going to once again go to
02:22 - the extensions section and once again
02:25 - write SQL tools here and you will be
02:27 - able to see the popular drivers which
02:31 - are supported for different database
02:34 - systems like MySQL
02:37 - sqlite postr Microsoft SQL Server so
02:41 - these are the official drivers for all
02:44 - these database systems so whatever
02:47 - database system you are using just click
02:50 - on that uh option so it's going to start
02:54 - with SQL tool and then the name of that
02:57 - database system so in my case its SQL
03:00 - tools MySQL and then I'm going to click
03:03 - on this driver extension also once this
03:07 - driver extension is installed I can
03:10 - close this window and I can see these
03:13 - options now so once again when I click
03:16 - on SQL tools and let me close this and
03:19 - then once again when I click on add new
03:22 - connection I will be able to see these
03:26 - options because I have installed the
03:28 - mysq
03:30 - driver extension for SQL tool and now
03:33 - let's click on this MySQL option here
03:36 - and here you can provide the details
03:39 - about your connection so I'm running my
03:42 - MySQL server locally so I'm going to
03:45 - name my uh connection as
03:48 - MySQL local and the connection group you
03:52 - can provide the name of your connection
03:53 - group I'm going to leave it as default
03:55 - now in the third option you can connect
03:58 - using the server and the port you can
04:01 - also connect via socket file or you can
04:04 - connect via the connection string we are
04:07 - going to use the server and the port
04:10 - option then as I mentioned my server is
04:13 - running on the Local Host so I'm going
04:16 - to leave it as default if your MySQL
04:18 - server is running on some remote server
04:21 - just give the IP address of that remote
04:24 - server Now the default port on which
04:27 - MySQL runs is 33 06 and most probably
04:31 - you are also using this default Port but
04:35 - if you are using any other Port then
04:38 - just provide that port for your MySQL
04:42 - server now if you are running MySQL
04:45 - locally and if you're using SQL tools
04:48 - here you need to add one extra zero in
04:52 - front of uh this port so if you're using
04:56 - 3360 here I need to use one extra zero
05:01 - in order to connect via the SQL tools
05:05 - option so don't forget to add this extra
05:08 - zero and then you also need to provide
05:11 - the name of the database so this
05:13 - database should preexist in your MySQL
05:16 - server I'm going to give the database
05:19 - name demo this database pre-exists on my
05:24 - MySQL server so make sure you have
05:26 - created this database previously
05:30 - now the username is the username which
05:32 - you use to connect to your MySQL server
05:34 - in my case it's
05:36 - root then you also have the option to
05:39 - choose the password mode so you have all
05:43 - these different options like uh SQL
05:46 - tools driver credentials ask on connect
05:49 - use empty password and save as plain
05:52 - text in settings so I'm going to use the
05:55 - last option here because I just uh want
05:58 - to make things simp simple but if you
06:00 - want to use any other option you can uh
06:03 - choose that option from here let me
06:05 - provide the password which I Ed to
06:07 - connect to my MySQL server now here
06:10 - under MySQL driver specific options we
06:13 - need to select uh X protocol for
06:16 - Authentication Protocol and if you're
06:18 - using SSL connection for your server
06:21 - then you can use enabled otherwise leave
06:24 - it as disabled you also need to provide
06:26 - the connection timeout for your uh MySQL
06:30 - server connection I'm going to provide
06:31 - 30 here but you are free to provide any
06:34 - other timeout here and then you also
06:37 - have the option for show records default
06:40 - limit here by default it's 50 I'm okay
06:43 - with it so I'm going to leave it as
06:45 - default once you have given all these uh
06:49 - configurations you can also test your
06:51 - connection by clicking on the test
06:53 - connection button so I'm going to click
06:54 - on test connection and I can see that uh
06:58 - the connection is successful ful so I
06:59 - can see this status here once I'm happy
07:03 - I'm going to click on Save connection
07:05 - and my connection is created here you
07:07 - will be able to see the list of all the
07:09 - connections here on the left hand side
07:12 - and you can also see uh this kind of uh
07:16 - connection configuration on the right
07:18 - hand side now in order to connect to
07:21 - your uh database server you can click on
07:23 - this Connect Now button or you can also
07:26 - click on this plug icon for The Connect
07:29 - so that uh connection will be successful
07:32 - so I'm going to click on uh this connect
07:34 - icon here and if the connection works
07:37 - it's going to show you this kind of SQL
07:40 - session so here you can run your SQL
07:43 - queries so let's say in my demo data
07:45 - base I need to create a new table I can
07:48 - write the query for that the query is
07:50 - really simple I want to create a users's
07:53 - database and the column which I need is
07:56 - ID username and email here in in order
07:59 - to run this query you can uh just click
08:02 - on this run the active connection option
08:06 - which is going to create this so once uh
08:09 - this query runs successfully you can
08:12 - expand this uh option here and you will
08:15 - be able to see your database name and
08:18 - when you expand this database you will
08:20 - be able to see tables here and then when
08:22 - you expand you will be able to see your
08:24 - tables I have recently created this
08:27 - users table so I can see this users
08:30 - table here I can also see what columns
08:33 - this table has by just expanding on the
08:36 - table option so now I have added some
08:40 - columns to my table let's insert some
08:44 - data to the table so to insert the data
08:47 - to the table I can once again write the
08:50 - insert query here so let me just uh do
08:54 - it like this so you can see the query
08:57 - and you can also see the output put here
09:00 - okay so this query is also really simple
09:03 - I'm going to use insert into the table
09:05 - name and then I want to just add the
09:08 - username and email ID because the ID is
09:11 - auto incrementing here right we just
09:13 - want to run this query right so in order
09:16 - to run this query only you can just
09:19 - select the query right click on the
09:21 - query and also you also have the option
09:24 - to run the selected query we need to use
09:28 - this option here so I'm I'm going to
09:29 - click on run selected query which is
09:32 - going to run my query and then we will
09:36 - be able to see the output now once I
09:38 - have inserted some data how can I view
09:41 - this the simple option is you can uh
09:44 - just write the select query so I can
09:47 - just write uh select srix from users so
09:51 - you can see when I type any query it uh
09:54 - gives me the autocomplete option and I'm
09:57 - going to select this query and then
09:58 - right click on it and then click on run
10:01 - selected query you can also press
10:03 - command e command e on Mac if you are
10:07 - using other operating system you will be
10:10 - able to see the key combination in front
10:13 - of this run selected query here so just
10:17 - run it and then I can see the data here
10:21 - you can see this data is available here
10:24 - I have ran this query two times that's
10:27 - why uh it was giving me uh the data two
10:30 - times the select option is also
10:32 - available when you click on the table
10:36 - option so right click on your table here
10:40 - and then click on show table record and
10:42 - it's going to show you the table record
10:45 - you can also right click on your table
10:47 - and you have the option to describe your
10:49 - table so click on that and it's going to
10:52 - describe your tables that means what are
10:55 - the columns which are available here
10:57 - what are uh their constraints if there
11:00 - is a primary key there so all the
11:03 - information about your table right you
11:06 - also have the option to generate insert
11:08 - query right so when you right click on
11:12 - the user table for example I right click
11:14 - here and then click on insert query it's
11:17 - going to insert the insert query just
11:21 - below your other queries so you can see
11:24 - I have the same kind of query which is
11:26 - insert into users and then I have the
11:29 - option uh to add the ID username and
11:33 - email as I mentioned ID is uh Auto
11:37 - incrementing in my case so I'm going to
11:39 - remove the ID option from here but I can
11:42 - add the username and email from here
11:45 - just change these values and then you
11:47 - can insert those values then I can run
11:51 - this uh query you know the drill just
11:55 - click on run selected query and once
11:58 - that successful right click on your
12:01 - table and then click on show table
12:03 - records and I can see the seventh record
12:06 - is added here this is how you can
12:09 - connect to your MySQL server and query
12:12 - and query your mySQL database using the
12:16 - visual studio code and this SQL tools
12:19 - extension now let's say in future you
12:22 - need to change the configuration of your
12:24 - MySQL connection you can do that also so
12:26 - let let's say you have changed the IP
12:29 - address of your MySQL connection and you
12:31 - want to change it into a connection you
12:34 - can right click on your connection here
12:36 - and then click on edit connection and
12:39 - then you will be able to edit your
12:42 - connection configuration from here once
12:44 - again so that is also useful if you want
12:47 - to disconnect you can click on this icon
12:49 - here for disconnection you also have the
12:52 - option to refresh your connection and
12:55 - then delete your connection and then you
12:57 - also have the option for open settings
13:01 - and hopefully this will be helpful tool
13:03 - for you also so that's it for this video
