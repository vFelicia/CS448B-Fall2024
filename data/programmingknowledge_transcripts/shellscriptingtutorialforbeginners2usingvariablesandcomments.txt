00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shelf tripping tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - the last video we have seen how we can
00:06 - create our first script and how we can
00:09 - execute our first hello world script now
00:12 - in this video we will talk about
00:13 - comments and variables so let's get
00:16 - started so first of all let's talk about
00:19 - comments because they are really easy to
00:22 - use and understand so first of all what
00:25 - are comments comments are the lines of
00:27 - code which are not executed by a script
00:30 - but are helpful to know some information
00:32 - about your scripts so how we can write
00:37 - comments we can write comments with a
00:40 - hash before a line of comments so
00:43 - whenever you start a line of code with
00:46 - hash then it will become a comment right
00:50 - so just write hash and then when I write
00:53 - this is a comment then this is a comment
00:58 - right and this will not be executed by a
01:01 - script but it will give you some
01:03 - information about your you know script
01:06 - and then the second way of writing the
01:09 - comment is like this also so you write
01:11 - your code or line of code and then after
01:15 - that start a hash and then this is also
01:20 - a comment right so this will also be
01:24 - your comment and it will also not be
01:26 - executed right now these are the two
01:30 - most common ways of using comments in
01:34 - your script there are some other ways
01:36 - but these are the most commonly used
01:38 - ways right now let's talk about
01:41 - variables so what are variables
01:44 - variables are the container which stores
01:48 - some data inside them right so whenever
01:52 - you define a variable this store some
01:55 - kind of data it can be a string data or
01:57 - any number on any other kind of data
02:00 - right now in shell there are or any UNIX
02:05 - system there are two types of variables
02:08 - one is the system variable
02:12 - and other are called the user defined
02:16 - variables
02:17 - okay so first is what are a system
02:20 - variable system variables are created
02:23 - and maintained by your Linux or UNIX
02:28 - operating system so these are the some
02:31 - predefined variable which are defined by
02:33 - your operating system and the standard
02:37 - convention is they are these are the
02:40 - variables which are defined in capital
02:43 - cases right so whenever you see some
02:46 - variables which are capital most likely
02:49 - they are the system variables now the
02:52 - other type of variables are user defined
02:54 - variables and these types of variables
02:57 - are created and maintained by the user
03:00 - like us right and these are type of
03:03 - variables are generally defined in lower
03:05 - cases but there is no you know strict
03:09 - rule that you need to write your
03:11 - variables in lower cases you can even
03:14 - write them in capital cases also so
03:18 - let's see what are what are some system
03:22 - variables which are we can use in
03:24 - scripts so for example I will write echo
03:28 - and then you write a dollar symbol
03:31 - before a variable and then there is a
03:34 - variable call for example bash and it
03:36 - will give you your bash shell name right
03:40 - and let's just save your script and
03:45 - let's run our script so I'm going to
03:47 - just run our script and what it gives
03:51 - this variable this variable gives us the
03:55 - name of the bash or shell right there
04:00 - are some more variables for example echo
04:05 - bash version so I'm going to just write
04:07 - bash version and then it will give me
04:13 - the bash version right and let me just
04:16 - copy it few times and then there is a
04:20 - one variable for example for your home
04:23 - then you use home
04:26 - this will give you the home directory
04:27 - and then there is variable called PWD
04:31 - present working directory it will give
04:34 - you whatever where present working
04:36 - directory you are working in right and
04:38 - there are some more variables in you
04:43 - know your operating systems but you just
04:46 - need to you know search name or just
04:48 - search the system variables right so I'm
04:52 - going to just term execute the script
04:54 - once again and what it gives but it
04:57 - gives me the bash name or shell name
05:00 - then it gives me the bash version this
05:02 - is the version of bash I'm using and
05:04 - then it gives me the home directory and
05:07 - then it gives me the present working
05:10 - directory which is desktop so I'm
05:12 - working on my desktop directory you can
05:14 - see here also right now let's talk about
05:17 - the user defined variables right so how
05:20 - we can define user defined so you can
05:23 - define user defined variables really
05:26 - simply by giving a name so for example I
05:30 - want to create a variable called name so
05:34 - I will just write the name here and then
05:37 - I will just give a equal symbol here or
05:41 - equal sign here and then the values so
05:44 - for example mark okay and how you can
05:48 - use this variable you can use this
05:50 - variable with a dollar symbol before it
05:52 - so I will just write echo and then I
05:55 - will just write dollar here and then the
05:59 - name of the variable so my variable name
06:01 - is name itself right so it will give me
06:04 - the name now with echo you can also
06:07 - write for example you can just write the
06:10 - name is and then the variable name right
06:15 - so this will give me the name whatever
06:18 - this name variable contains right and I
06:22 - will just execute my script and print
06:26 - the name is mark right so your variable
06:30 - name can be used with your echo you know
06:34 - string with a dollar symbol before it
06:37 - right
06:39 - so in the same way you can you know
06:41 - write some text here also and it will
06:45 - work fine so what we will write is for
06:48 - example I will write our shall name is
06:52 - this one right or our shell version name
06:57 - is something like something else so our
07:00 - shell version name is this right or for
07:05 - our home directory we can just write our
07:07 - home directory is home this is the
07:13 - system variable right or for the present
07:16 - working directory or current working
07:18 - with current working directory we can
07:21 - write something like this or current
07:23 - working directory is this right it will
07:27 - also work fine so let's execute our
07:29 - script let me clear the terminal and
07:32 - then I will just execute my script it
07:36 - gives me the output so first of all
07:39 - hello world and then our shell name is
07:42 - this or shell version name is this our
07:46 - directory is this home directory and
07:49 - then our current working directory is
07:51 - this one and then we have defined a
07:54 - user-defined variable which is this one
07:57 - right now let's define some other
08:01 - variables so let me define 10 and then
08:05 - this can be the variables right you can
08:10 - think of this as a variable and then I
08:13 - will name my variable as for example 10
08:17 - well okay just random and then I will
08:21 - give you the value give it the value of
08:24 - 10 here right and let's print this 10
08:28 - here so value and then I'm going to just
08:33 - give the name of the variable right and
08:36 - let's see what happens and I'm going to
08:39 - execute the script and gives me this
08:43 - kind of result which is not the result
08:48 - we are expecting right so the problem
08:51 - here
08:52 - is the variable name should not start
08:55 - with the number right so if your
09:00 - variable name starts with a number it
09:02 - will not be considered as a variable so
09:04 - what it prints here is this value here
09:08 - right it just disregards this kind of
09:13 - output because it's not considering this
09:18 - value as a variable right and if you
09:21 - start your variable name with a normal
09:25 - letter small or capital it will be your
09:28 - variable so let's print once again I
09:31 - print the correct value of the variables
09:34 - write your value can be or you can
09:37 - define a variable in capital also so
09:39 - something like well you something like
09:42 - this also it's totally fine and let's
09:46 - print it let me clear the terminal first
09:49 - of all and let's execute our script
09:52 - right and it executes the same result
09:56 - right so in this way we have learned how
10:00 - we can use comments and variables with
10:03 - our script so we have used the system
10:06 - variables also and we have used the user
10:09 - defined variables also so I hope you
