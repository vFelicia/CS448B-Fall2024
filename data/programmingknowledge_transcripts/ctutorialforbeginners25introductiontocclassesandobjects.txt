00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:03 - video I'm going to give you a basic
00:05 - introduction to classes and object in
00:09 - C++ so first of all what is a Class A
00:13 - Class is a collection of related data
00:17 - and function under a single
00:20 - name so let me paste you this definition
00:23 - and once again go through the definition
00:26 - of a Class A Class is a collection of
00:29 - related data and function under a Sim
00:32 - single name so for example a C++ program
00:37 - can contain hundreds and hundreds of
00:39 - functions and thousands of
00:43 - variables and using class we collect
00:47 - same kind of functions and data and we
00:51 - use this collection in single class so
00:56 - for example you have a book class
01:00 - you can collect functions related to
01:03 - book for example print book open book
01:07 - Close book and variables related to book
01:11 - class for example you have author of the
01:14 - book name of the book uh and how many
01:18 - number of pages book contains so this
01:22 - kind of data which is same or related to
01:26 - one another we encapsulate this kind of
01:30 - functions of it this kind of variable in
01:32 - a single class the second example can be
01:36 - a box class which can contain the height
01:40 - width and the length of the box and it
01:43 - can contain a fun contain functions like
01:47 - the volume of the box or the surface
01:51 - area of the Box okay so using class we
01:56 - collect related data and function
02:00 - uh in C++ now let me uh give you an
02:04 - example how you can declare a class in
02:07 - C++ you can declare a class n C++
02:11 - using the name class itself and then you
02:16 - give the name to your class generally
02:19 - it's a good practice to start your class
02:22 - name with a capital letter so for
02:26 - example I want to make a class called
02:28 - book so I will write this class
02:33 - as
02:35 - books and then you give these
02:38 - parenthesis and this
02:41 - semicolon okay so this is a basic
02:44 - definition of class and inside your
02:46 - class you can declare different
02:50 - variables or different functions okay
02:54 - now there
02:56 - is a word called access specifier
03:01 - now for example if you want to use
03:04 - variables or function which you declare
03:07 - inside this class uh in your main
03:12 - program so the functions in book class
03:15 - you want to use it in your main program
03:19 - you use Public Access
03:24 - specifier or otherwise if you don't want
03:26 - to use your function inside your class
03:30 - and you just want to use your function
03:32 - inside your class inside your class
03:35 - itself then you need to use private
03:39 - access specifier but this I will explain
03:43 - you later right now we are going to use
03:45 - a public access specifier so you can uh
03:49 - declare this public access specifier
03:53 - like this just write the name public and
03:56 - then give this colon not this but this
04:00 - colon and whatever you write under
04:04 - this will be considered or will be
04:08 - treated as public members of this class
04:12 - for example I declare a variable
04:16 - int and I will
04:18 - say the book ID so I will declare it
04:23 - book ID is equal
04:26 - to 256 for example and I will declare a
04:32 - function also inside this class to print
04:35 - the book ID so I will
04:38 - say
04:42 - void
04:43 - print
04:45 - book
04:46 - ID and I
04:50 - will give this parenthesis and in inside
04:55 - this I will just print the book ID so I
04:57 - will say see out
05:02 - the book ID
05:07 - is equal to and then I will just copy
05:13 - this book ID paste it here and
05:18 - endline okay now I have
05:23 - declared uh variable inside my book
05:27 - class and I have declared a function
05:30 - inside my book class so you can declare
05:33 - variables and functions inside your book
05:36 - class or inside your any class right now
05:41 - for example you want to use these
05:44 - members or this
05:45 - function in here inside your main
05:49 - function what you need to do is you need
05:52 - to declare a object of this class and
05:55 - why do we use
05:58 - object because
06:00 - there can be many classes inside your
06:04 - program and there can
06:06 - be functions which have the same name
06:10 - for example the other class can also
06:13 - contain print book ID the other class
06:16 - can also contain ID so there can be
06:20 - multiple definition of these function
06:22 - and how will you know which class this
06:26 - function belongs to so for for this you
06:30 - need to declare object so you know which
06:34 - class this function belongs to okay so
06:38 - an object is an instance of the class
06:42 - right now to declare the object what you
06:46 - need to do is you need to use the name
06:49 - of the class so I will just use the name
06:51 - of the class and then you need to
06:54 - give the variable name or object name to
06:59 - to this so I will give the object name
07:03 - for example book
07:07 - one and semicolon so this variable or
07:12 - this is called the object of the class
07:15 - and we will we are going to access the
07:19 - the functions inside this book class or
07:22 - variable inside this book class using
07:24 - this object okay so how we can use
07:30 - this function print book ID using this
07:34 - book one object just write book one and
07:38 - we use this dot separator in order to
07:41 - access this function so I will use this
07:43 - print book function and just
07:47 - semicolon and then now I can
07:51 - just compile my
07:54 - program and hopefully it will not give
07:56 - me any errors so my program is built now
08:00 - and now I can run my program so I will
08:03 - run my program and you can see the book
08:05 - ID is and whatever the ID of the book
08:09 - right so in this way you can declare
08:12 - object of a class and you
08:14 - can access the member of the class these
08:19 - are called member function and this is
08:21 - called the member variable you can
08:24 - directly access this variable by for
08:27 - example you want to access this variable
08:30 - because this is a public
08:33 - uh public variable we have declared this
08:37 - in public uh access
08:41 - uh member variable so we can just write
08:46 - it
08:47 - here see
08:51 - out book
08:53 - one do ID okay and this will print you
09:00 - the book ID which is
09:03 - 256 right so you can access this
09:05 - variable also because this is a public
09:09 - member of this class right and now I
09:12 - will R build my program and run it and
09:15 - you can see it has printed 256 here so
09:19 - this is the basic introduction of
09:21 - classes and object in C++ in the coming
09:24 - videos we will discuss more about
09:26 - classes uh so stay tuned and please rate
09:29 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
