00:01 - hello guys and welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in the previous video we
00:06 - learned about how to create menu option
00:09 - in a kinder window for example one which
00:13 - are created here in the previous video I
00:15 - will show you the output so this is the
00:20 - menu field which we created with
00:23 - basically two functionality so far about
00:26 - it is showing the message box and
00:30 - profile insert it will exit the window
00:33 - so we long to will move on to the next
00:37 - step that is creating a window within a
00:42 - window so for example after registration
00:46 - of a successful registration
00:48 - I want to redirect or get a new window
00:53 - and which basically is a login window so
00:57 - after successful registration I want a
01:00 - new window about login that kind of
01:06 - situation so in here I just show you a
01:09 - small demo that how you can create a
01:13 - window good thing even though in kinder
01:18 - and using a nada button so right now
01:26 - there are only two button that is sign
01:28 - up and quit so for this we'll be using
01:31 - another button that is a login button
01:35 - and let's create one right now so at the
01:39 - bottom so these are the to sign up and
01:46 - quit button copy one of them and
01:58 - rename it as a login button so it is not
02:02 - basically a login window I'm making a
02:05 - I'm just showing a demo that how you can
02:07 - create one using the approach which I'm
02:10 - telling you right now okay
02:13 - so rename the text login cute as it is
02:22 - and for right now there is no come on
02:26 - okay and we'll place it add two and
02:37 - eight and the y-axis will be around 60
02:42 - so 60 so let's see the output as you can
02:50 - see it is in between of this sign up and
02:53 - quit button okay so this is the button
02:56 - which we have created now what we'll
03:00 - have to do is create a function which
03:05 - can be used for opening another window
03:12 - so create a function defined and name it
03:20 - as second wind : and similarly like the
03:34 - one which we have created and that is a
03:41 - first of all we need to create a window
03:46 - object that is when is equal to T
03:51 - kay okay then
03:56 - put a title to that second window dot
04:00 - sorry title and name it as welcome
04:10 - - second window okay now we'll just go
04:21 - at it simple geometry Oh we'll just go
04:29 - word is at I guess 250 look 50 and X 200
04:41 - so this is like a height and do it and
04:47 - now we just provide a label we just copy
04:51 - or one melt problem we'll just name it
04:55 - label underscore on zero to shield okay
05:05 - then provide a label now when it comes
05:12 - to the second window you don't have to
05:14 - provide the main route window that is
05:17 - over here because it's for that main
05:20 - window now you're creating entirely new
05:23 - kinder windows so for that you need to
05:27 - use the route or the window which is
05:32 - provided over here just taken as a
05:34 - parent object for the kilter frame right
05:38 - okay so we'll be using window comma now
05:43 - text is equal to registration stration
05:58 - so this is basically a label sorry for
06:04 - that I just place it inside okay
06:08 - station successful
06:15 - the spelling is wrong okay or you can
06:19 - just say it as successful mission
06:23 - completed right okay so this looks good
06:28 - and we'll be providing relief is equal
06:40 - to solid that is for relief is equal
06:48 - solid , and which is quite fond fond is
06:59 - equal to area I'm stabbing things right
07:06 - okay so we'll just come over here this
07:13 - part a parenthesis Ariel then comma 12
07:23 - comma bold right and we'll close that
07:31 - too and we'll just place it just cancel
07:42 - this one it is creating an obstacle so
07:45 - place that at X is equal to on 30 and y
07:55 - is equal to 70 so it is a small window
07:58 - and we also create a small button button
08:07 - and this cause 0 2 0 1 whatever you can
08:11 - name it this is copy the button down
08:15 - from down here
08:21 - don't want to type it okay so okay so
08:32 - Fagin alright so just a sheet over here
08:37 - change the position up it as eighty and
08:48 - zero okay white okay no problem
08:54 - okay this is called it this looks good
08:58 - okay so okay now here we have to change
09:02 - the window to window and just rename it
09:12 - all you can provide it as demo button no
09:17 - problem with that again and okay so now
09:23 - this is this looks good and now we just
09:27 - go down to the login button over here
09:30 - and provide that come on comma oops
09:41 - command is equal to second well okay so
09:47 - so let's run this and see what is the
09:50 - output okay so that there is no error
09:52 - right now and we'll click so so as you
09:58 - can see there this is an entirely new
10:02 - window now with a label registration
10:06 - completed and a button demo so right now
10:10 - there is no functionality to that button
10:12 - but I'll just quote a simple message box
10:15 - to it so this are two entirely two
10:18 - different window so for the purpose of
10:22 - so advancement to this entire reception
10:24 - form one can create a registration form
10:27 - with certain violation and can redirect
10:30 - it to on the second window and provide
10:33 - some entry widgets like
10:35 - login name and user password with to
10:39 - enter visits and a login so this is a
10:44 - basic idea how you can perform so these
10:46 - are two different entire two different
10:49 - windows so this is how you can perform
10:50 - one and I'll just provide a function ID
10:54 - third button let me just type in here
10:57 - command is equal to about maybe I'll
11:04 - just check whether it is up or down
11:08 - yeah it is definitely up I guess
11:12 - okay so let's see whether it works or
11:15 - not
11:18 - so log in this is the second button and
11:22 - let's click on do this demo so as you
11:25 - can see it works so this is this is the
11:28 - second window and we have provided a
11:30 - single function that is a message box to
11:32 - this demo button with a message box
11:35 - right so as you can see this is basic
11:39 - approach of creating two separate
11:41 - windows from one same window so over
11:44 - here I have created three sign up quit
11:47 - and login and from by clicking login
11:49 - this particular button opens right so
11:53 - this is it for this video guys if you
11:57 - have any more implementation to this
12:02 - existing approach you can use it or for
12:08 - the advancement and thanks for watching
