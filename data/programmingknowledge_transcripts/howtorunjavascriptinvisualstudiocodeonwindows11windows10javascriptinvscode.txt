00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can add the JavaScript
00:05 - support in your Visual Studio code
00:08 - editor so essentially I'm going to show
00:10 - you how you can run a JavaScript code in
00:13 - your Visual Studio code editor so
00:15 - hopefully you have already installed
00:17 - Visual Studio code now in order to run
00:20 - JavaScript code inside your Visual
00:23 - Studio code or any operating system you
00:26 - need a tool called node.js node.js is a
00:30 - JavaScript framework which will allow
00:32 - you to create web applications in
00:35 - JavaScript right so if you install
00:38 - node.js you will be able to run
00:40 - JavaScript code also in order to install
00:43 - node.js just open your favorite browser
00:46 - and search for node.js and the first
00:48 - link which will appear here will be from
00:50 - node.js so I'm going to click on this
00:52 - link at the time of making this video uh
00:56 - these are the two versions I always go
00:59 - with LTS version LTS stands for long
01:03 - term support versions right so they have
01:06 - the support for longer term so just
01:10 - choose the version which says LTS in
01:13 - front of it at the time of making this
01:15 - video
01:16 - 18.15.0 is the latest version so let me
01:19 - click on this button which will download
01:22 - this node.js MSI file so I'm going to
01:25 - click on this MSI file once it's
01:28 - downloaded
01:29 - and I'm going to just minimize my
01:33 - browser here so you can see the node.js
01:36 - setup wizard has been started on this
01:39 - window just click on next here
01:41 - click on I accept the term slices
01:44 - agreement click on next
01:46 - this will be the default location where
01:48 - node.js will be installed so if you
01:50 - don't have the good reason to change
01:51 - this just leave it as default and then
01:53 - click on next
01:54 - and then click on next and then you can
01:57 - see automatically install necessary
01:59 - tools
02:00 - so for now I don't want to install
02:02 - additional tools but later on you can
02:05 - install these additional tools for
02:07 - node.js right I'm going to click on next
02:10 - and then click on install
02:12 - and then click on yes which is going to
02:15 - install node.js on my Windows operating
02:18 - system so just wait for this progress
02:20 - bar to reach to the 100 Mark and once
02:23 - that's done you can see completed
02:26 - node.js Setup Wizard click on finish and
02:30 - node.js is installed on your Windows
02:33 - operating system to check whether it's
02:36 - installed correctly you can just type
02:39 - CMD in Search and then click on command
02:43 - prompt and then just type node and then
02:46 - press enter which is going to open this
02:49 - node rapple which stands for read a well
02:54 - print Loop here you can write a very
02:58 - simple JavaScript code for example
03:03 - console DOT log and I can print
03:07 - something here okay so let me print
03:11 - hello
03:12 - World here and then press enter and it
03:15 - prints hello worlds so this is
03:17 - essentially the JavaScript code which
03:20 - you are running with the help of this
03:21 - node.js tool now let's open our Visual
03:25 - Studio code editor
03:27 - and here I can open a folder or let me
03:30 - show you one more thing so let's say I
03:34 - have this Javascript app folder on my
03:36 - desktop where I want to create my
03:39 - JavaScript files here I can open this
03:43 - folder and then right click here once
03:45 - Visual Studio code is installed click on
03:48 - show more options and then click on open
03:50 - with code and then this folder will be
03:53 - opened in your Visual Studio code editor
03:56 - now you can also open as command prompt
04:01 - so just once again go here right click
04:03 - and then open in a terminal and you can
04:07 - just CD into the folder in which you
04:10 - want to create a Javascript file and
04:12 - then type code space Dot and then press
04:15 - enter which is also going to open the
04:18 - JavaScript folder or whatever folder you
04:21 - want to open in Visual Studio code now
04:24 - let's create a Javascript file so I'm
04:26 - going to just click on this plus sign
04:28 - and then just type
04:32 - test dot JS okay and you can see this
04:38 - file is created so I can just type
04:42 - console DOT log and then
04:46 - I can just write hello
04:49 - World here so you can see Visual Studio
04:54 - code is going to provide you the
04:56 - intellisense also just save your file
04:58 - and in order to run your file you can
05:01 - open the terminal from the top so just
05:04 - click on Terminal and then click on new
05:06 - terminal and from here you can see the
05:10 - Powershell is open you can also open
05:12 - command prompt from here so click on
05:14 - command prompt
05:15 - and because we have installed node we
05:18 - can use node to run our Javascript file
05:21 - so I'm going to just write test dot JS
05:24 - after node so node space the name of the
05:27 - file which is test.js in my case and it
05:31 - prints hello world on Powershell if you
05:35 - select the Powershell here you can just
05:37 - write node and then the name of the file
05:40 - or whatever is the name of the file and
05:43 - then press tab here which is going to
05:45 - auto complete
05:47 - your
05:48 - file name so you can see it has Auto
05:51 - completed and on Powershell you just
05:54 - write dot backslash or in front of file
05:59 - name right so once again just press
06:02 - enter and it prints hello world
06:06 - so this is how you can run the
06:08 - JavaScript code using the terminal but
06:11 - in Visual Studio code you can also
06:14 - install some cool extensions to run your
06:18 - code so one such extension is code
06:21 - Runner so just search for code
06:24 - Runner here
06:26 - so just select this extensions tab first
06:29 - of all so you can see there is this
06:32 - extension Tab and then just search for
06:34 - code Runner and then select this first
06:37 - option which is called code Runner and
06:40 - it has around
06:42 - 18.6 million download so it's a very
06:45 - popular
06:46 - extension so just click on install to
06:49 - install this extension and once this
06:52 - extension is installed you can see you
06:55 - can uninstall or disable this extension
06:57 - later also once this that is installed I
07:00 - can close this window and as soon as I
07:03 - have installed this code Runner
07:05 - extension I can see this run code icon
07:09 - in front of the file right so on top
07:14 - right you can see this new option to run
07:17 - your JavaScript code so when you click
07:20 - on this
07:21 - run code option you will be able to see
07:25 - your code will be run automatically you
07:28 - don't need to type anything on the
07:30 - terminal it will run automatically right
07:33 - so let me add a few more options and
07:38 - then save my code and then I can rerun
07:41 - it and it will rerun my code and it
07:43 - prints hello world with all these
07:47 - symbols right
07:49 - now if you want to create more complex
07:51 - programs let me show you how you can do
07:54 - it so for example if you want to create
07:57 - a node.js server you can find this code
08:00 - anywhere on internet just search for how
08:05 - to create a simple node.js server and
08:09 - this code you will find there right and
08:12 - this is a JavaScript code and what it
08:16 - does is it creates a server which you
08:19 - can run on your browser and it's going
08:22 - to show you the hello world output right
08:25 - so let me just run this code and once
08:30 - it's running you can see it says server
08:32 - running at this
08:34 - IP address and this port so I'm going to
08:37 - just copy this
08:39 - or I can just control and click on this
08:43 - okay so control press Ctrl key and then
08:46 - click on this uh link which is going to
08:50 - open this on your browser so let me just
08:55 - paste this link and then it prints hello
08:57 - world as you can see here so you can
09:00 - even create some server code which is
09:05 - also written in JavaScript as you can
09:07 - see test dot JS right
09:09 - so this is how you can run the
09:13 - JavaScript code on your Visual Studio
09:16 - code editor Additionally you can install
09:19 - many JavaScript related extension so
09:23 - just type Java
09:25 - script here and then press enter and you
09:28 - will see many JavaScript related
09:31 - extensions so you can install all these
09:35 - popular extensions you can see this
09:38 - extension is downloaded 11 million times
09:41 - so this is very popular right and then
09:44 - you have this tribe script extension
09:47 - JavaScript debug extension so you can
09:49 - install all these extensions and all
09:52 - these extension will help you to develop
09:55 - your code and run your code efficiently
09:58 - okay so I hope you enjoyed this video
10:01 - and I will see you in the next video
