00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install numpy on the
00:05 - pycharm IDE
00:07 - so as you can see I have written a very
00:09 - simple numpy program here
00:12 - but you can see I can see this red
00:15 - squiggly line which says no module named
00:19 - numpy that means pycharm is not
00:23 - recognizing my numpy package and that's
00:27 - why it will show the error when I run
00:31 - this program so let me run this main dot
00:35 - Pui file it shows me this error which
00:39 - says no module named numpy so in order
00:42 - to install numpy for this project my
00:46 - project name is hello world as you can
00:48 - see so in order to install the numpy
00:51 - package on this project you can click on
00:54 - this file option and then click on
00:57 - settings
00:58 - and once this settings window opens you
01:02 - need to go to the project so just click
01:06 - on project and then the name of the
01:09 - project is hello world as you can see
01:11 - here and then click on python
01:13 - interpreter here right
01:15 - now you need to select the
01:19 - python interpreter in my case it's 3.10
01:23 - but it can be newer depending on when
01:27 - you are trying to install this numpy on
01:33 - your Pi charm IDE so choose the latest
01:36 - interpreter on top and then you just
01:39 - need to click on this plus sign here so
01:42 - click on this plus sign which is going
01:45 - to open this kind of window and here
01:47 - search for numpy so I'm going to just
01:51 - search for numpy here and then you will
01:55 - be able to see this numpy option okay so
01:59 - just select this numpy and then you just
02:03 - need to click on install package okay so
02:06 - select numpy here and then click on
02:09 - install package and you can see it's
02:12 - showing this progress and once numpy
02:15 - package is installed you will be able to
02:18 - see this green in line and here you can
02:22 - see the text package numpy installed
02:25 - successfully so once this package is
02:27 - installed successfully you can close
02:30 - this window
02:31 - and you will be able to see numpy here
02:34 - listed in this section once you see
02:37 - numpy listed here you can click on OK
02:40 - and then try to run your numpy uh
02:46 - project once again so you can see that
02:49 - red squiggly line is gone and when I
02:52 - tried to run my numpy project it's going
02:56 - to run and show me the result here okay
02:58 - so this is how you can install numpy on
03:02 - pycharm I hope you enjoyed this video
03:04 - and I will see you in the next video
