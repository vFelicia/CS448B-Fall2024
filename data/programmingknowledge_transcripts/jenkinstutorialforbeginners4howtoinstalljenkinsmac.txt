00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - Jenkins on your Mac operating system now
00:08 - in order to install Jenkins we need to
00:09 - have Java installed on our system and we
00:12 - will see which version of Java we are
00:15 - required to install Jenkins on Jenkins
00:18 - page so let's get started and let's see
00:21 - how we can do it so first of all open
00:23 - your favorite browser and search for
00:25 - Jenkins and in here the first link which
00:29 - will appear here will be from Jenkins
00:31 - dot IO so I am going to click on this
00:33 - link and once you are in this website
00:36 - you just need to go to the Downloads
00:40 - button so I'm going to click on the
00:41 - Downloads button and then you will come
00:44 - to this Downloads web page right let's
00:47 - see the requirements of installing
00:49 - Jenkins on our Mac so in order to see
00:52 - that you just need to go to the
00:54 - documentation page I'm going to open
00:56 - this documentation page on the next tab
00:59 - so documentation page and then use
01:02 - Jenkins so just click on documentation
01:04 - and then click use Jenkins and in here
01:08 - we will just scroll down a little and we
01:11 - will just find the section which says
01:14 - installing Jenkins and I'm going to
01:16 - click on this and once you click on this
01:19 - we will see the prerequisite of
01:22 - installing Jenkins so here you can see
01:25 - the system requirements and under this
01:27 - you can see the software requirements
01:29 - and the software requirement says ja8
01:32 - either Java runtime environment or Java
01:35 - development kit is fine so we need to
01:38 - have Java 8 installed in order to use
01:42 - Jenkins on our Mac so I already have
01:45 - Java installed on my system if you don't
01:48 - you just need to install it now once you
01:51 - have done this we are ready to install
01:53 - Jenkins so just come to the downloads
01:55 - page and then just scroll down a little
01:58 - don't click on the download button we
02:00 - will just go down and we will search for
02:04 - the section which says Mac OSX now you
02:07 - can see here there are two categories
02:09 - here one is the weekly build
02:13 - so this is the most latest bill you can
02:16 - get for Jenkins and other is the LTS
02:20 - version which is long-term support
02:22 - version so we are going to download and
02:24 - install the LTS version so just go under
02:27 - the LTS of section and then choose the
02:31 - Mac OSX so just click on this Mac OS X
02:34 - and this is going to start the download
02:37 - of this Jenkins 2.10 7 which is the
02:41 - latest
02:42 - LTS version dot PKG file so i'm going to
02:46 - wait for this download to complete so
02:49 - now the download of this dot PKG file is
02:52 - complete so i'm going to double click on
02:53 - this PKG file and now i'm going to
02:56 - minimize the browser and you can see
02:58 - here the installer for Jenkins has been
03:00 - started so here I just need to click
03:03 - continue and the next step is to agree
03:05 - with the license terms and conditions so
03:08 - I'm going to just click on continue
03:10 - button and I'm going to just click agree
03:13 - and on this next step you will be asked
03:15 - how do you want to install the software
03:17 - install for all users of this computer
03:20 - so this is OK for me so I'm going to
03:22 - just click on continue and in the next
03:24 - step it says this will take around 74
03:27 - megabyte of space on your computer and
03:30 - then click install to perform the
03:33 - standard installation so I'm going to
03:35 - just click on install button and here I
03:38 - just need to give my Mac's password so
03:41 - I'm going to give my Mac's password and
03:42 - I'm going to just say install software
03:44 - and this is going to start the
03:47 - installation process for Jenkins so I am
03:50 - going to wait for the installation to
03:51 - complete and once the installation is
03:58 - complete you will see directly on your
04:01 - default browser on the localhost port
04:04 - 8080 this Jenkins page will start
04:08 - automatically and it will say please
04:11 - wait while Jenkins is getting ready to
04:14 - work ok so it will start automatically
04:17 - on localhost port 8080 so if it doesn't
04:21 - start you can just write on your
04:24 - favorite browser localhost port 8080 and
04:27 - you will see this kind of junk in space
04:29 - and the first step is to unlock Jenkins
04:34 - so the initial admin password for
04:38 - Jenkins which is required here is saved
04:42 - on this location so you need to just
04:46 - copy this initial admin password from
04:49 - this location and then you just need to
04:53 - paste it here in the admins password so
04:56 - I'm going to just copy this part and
04:58 - once you have copied this part just open
05:01 - your terminal and in here you just need
05:03 - to write sudo and then cat and then just
05:07 - paste this part and then press ENTER and
05:10 - give your Mac's password here and then
05:13 - press ENTER and then you will see this
05:16 - password here so you just need to copy
05:19 - this password which is this one in your
05:22 - case it can be different and then just
05:25 - paste this password here and then press
05:28 - Continue
05:29 - so just paste the password you have
05:30 - copied and then press Continue now on
05:33 - the next step you will be asked to
05:35 - customize Jenkins so there are two ways
05:38 - of doing this you can click this button
05:41 - which says install suggested plugins or
05:43 - you can click this button we say select
05:46 - plugins to install so we will choose the
05:48 - first option which says install
05:50 - suggested plugins and I'm going to click
05:52 - on this button which is going to start
05:55 - installing the suggested plugins these
05:58 - plugins are for example gate or LDAP or
06:03 - subversion plug-in or Gradle plugin so
06:06 - these are some of the suggested plugins
06:08 - which are suggested by Jenkins to us so
06:11 - I will just wait for the plugins to
06:14 - install it will take some times to
06:16 - install each and every plug-in so I'm
06:18 - going to wait for that and once each and
06:21 - every plug-in is installed we will be
06:24 - redirected to create our admin
06:27 - credential so I am going to wait for
06:28 - that so now all the plugins are
06:30 - installed on the jankins and i will be
06:33 - redirected to this create first admin
06:36 - user page automatically so after
06:40 - installing
06:41 - all the plugins you will see this page
06:43 - which says create first admin user so
06:46 - I'm going to create the first admin user
06:47 - and I'm going to just say username is
06:50 - admin you can give any name here
06:53 - username here and then give any password
06:56 - here and then repeat the password and
06:59 - then give your full name I'm going to
07:02 - just write admin months again but you
07:04 - are free to give any name which you like
07:07 - and here you just need to give your
07:08 - email whatever you like so I have given
07:11 - my email address and then I'm going to
07:14 - just press save and finish which is
07:16 - going to save this admin user and
07:19 - password and I'm going to just say never
07:22 - for this website and you will see this
07:25 - message which says Jenkins has ready
07:27 - start using Jenkins so I'm going to just
07:29 - click on this button they say start
07:31 - using Jenkins and you will see the
07:35 - Jenkins interface here right so here you
07:39 - can create your first job by clicking
07:41 - this button and then you can install
07:44 - other plugins to manage the users which
07:48 - we will cover in the later video so I'm
07:50 - going to click on this link which says
07:53 - create new jobs and from here you can
07:55 - create a different kind of jobs for
07:59 - example freestyle project or pipeline or
08:02 - multi configuration project or any other
08:05 - kind of project so this we are going to
08:08 - see later so this is how you can
08:10 - download and install Jenkins on your Mac
08:12 - operating system I hope you have enjoyed
