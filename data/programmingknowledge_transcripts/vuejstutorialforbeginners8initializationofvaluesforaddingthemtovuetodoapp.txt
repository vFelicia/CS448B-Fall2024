00:00 - so hello everyone welcome to tutorial
00:02 - number eight so
00:03 - this is the github dot com slash pro
00:05 - software development done view
00:07 - here you can get all the files related
00:09 - to the previous tutorials and
00:10 - you can get the code of the files there
00:13 - and you can run them on your machine
00:15 - it's very easy you have to just click on
00:17 - the html file and all the code will run
00:19 - as it is
00:20 - so the title is adding add a task or a
00:22 - to-do functionality
00:23 - in view to do app so we are creating a
00:26 - uh studio app and
00:28 - now today we are going to add a
00:29 - functionality to add a task or a to-do
00:32 - which is the like the backbone of our
00:34 - app so
00:35 - creating add a test task functionality
00:38 - so this is going to be a method
00:39 - and also submitting the data for the
00:41 - same through form
00:42 - okay so let's refresh this page
00:46 - so okay
00:49 - unexpected token okay let me say okay
00:53 - so just for a second you can i can i
00:55 - will remove this and i will refresh the
00:57 - page
00:58 - so here you can see the script started
01:00 - now our our first thing we need to do
01:02 - for we need to render the component
01:04 - view component and for that what we'll
01:07 - do
01:07 - first we'll create the uh we'll create
01:10 - the
01:12 - a view constructor so constant app
01:15 - is equal to new view so i told you the
01:18 - uh the view view component has three
01:22 - things
01:23 - first is the like element so this is the
01:26 - json object inside the constructor
01:28 - and inside this it will have the element
01:31 - uh
01:32 - data this is the data
01:36 - and the next we are going to have is
01:37 - methods
01:39 - so methods is this yeah perfectly fine
01:43 - so we need to define all the three
01:44 - things uh one by one
01:46 - so this would help us to render the
01:48 - component
01:50 - okay let's see how we render them so
01:53 - this is the ids you do have and we need
01:55 - to define them and id is signified using
01:58 - the hash
01:59 - symbol so hash app perfectly fine
02:03 - so we'll put a comma yeah so data is an
02:06 - empty json object uh
02:08 - for the time being we'll remove yeah and
02:10 - method is an empty json object for the
02:12 - time being and we look
02:14 - yeah so let's refresh the page and we
02:16 - think
02:17 - yeah the script started and what we can
02:20 - do just for our
02:21 - like so the we can now we know the since
02:24 - the script has started and the crypt
02:26 - script is working perfectly fine so we
02:29 - can
02:29 - for the timing we can keep this and when
02:31 - we are done so we can
02:33 - uh remove this okay so first
02:37 - very simple thing what we are going to
02:38 - render is the heading
02:41 - heading is
02:44 - to do app using
02:48 - view js okay
02:51 - so this is the part this is the like
02:54 - heading and i'll copy this now
02:57 - okay okay okay what do i do and now i'll
03:00 - render this
03:02 - so what we'll do uh i can remove this
03:06 - h1 okay now
03:10 - what i'll do i'll put h1 tag here
03:14 - and i i'll use the like the template
03:17 - i'll use the
03:18 - how we render the value using this
03:20 - double curly braces
03:23 - heading and now i'll put the double
03:26 - curly bits again
03:28 - now what i'm trying to say that this
03:30 - heading
03:31 - should be rendered here and we would get
03:33 - the value and plus we will get to know
03:34 - that our
03:35 - app has now binded successfully with the
03:37 - component
03:39 - okay then we can just put the starting
03:41 - let me define style
03:43 - is your text align is able to center
03:46 - okay
03:47 - so now let's refresh this page yeah
03:49 - perfectly fine to do app using vgs
03:52 - and we have got the value okay now
03:55 - we will try to make this app a
03:58 - responsive
03:59 - yeah so yeah yeah
04:03 - so what we can do so div id is a google
04:06 - app and we can give this
04:09 - app as a class is equal to call md6
04:13 - so that we get it here in the center and
04:18 - we are going to define as a style is
04:20 - equal to margin
04:22 - 0 auto yeah
04:26 - so this would align themselves to the
04:28 - center okay
04:30 - now now now you can see that
04:34 - it has a width of column d6 and
04:36 - everything is aligned to the center
04:38 - and we can do one thing
04:43 - we can add a padding here padding is
04:47 - equal to
04:48 - one rim
04:52 - yeah now i refresh this page i use the
04:55 - while view yeah now here you can see
04:57 - it's perfectly fine
04:58 - and now i have a like i have a padding
05:01 - so it's like perfectly fine
05:03 - so let me do one check on this yeah
05:08 - so yeah so so like this is perfectly
05:12 - fine
05:12 - okay now i'll do one thing
05:16 - okay yeah so this is fine
05:20 - so this is all we wanted so this one is
05:23 - perfectly fine and
05:25 - it looks good to get carrying with this
05:28 - okay
05:28 - now i'll close this yeah so
05:32 - you can add this label add your to-do
05:34 - here and you can this is perfectly fine
05:37 - okay
05:38 - now what you can do you can also put
05:40 - this
05:41 - inside a style tag side due to text the
05:44 - line is go to center
05:45 - so this would also align them so to
05:47 - center as well
05:49 - okay indian alignment into center okay
05:53 - label for text aligning go to center
05:59 - and i'll put this as a margin 0 auto
06:03 - so margin 0 auto
06:09 - okay let me inspect this element
06:19 - yeah so what you can
06:22 - we can do is we can move the styling
06:25 - from here and if you want you can add a
06:30 - style is equal to
06:31 - text align is equal to center here so
06:34 - this would work perfectly fine
06:36 - yeah so now it's in the center we are
06:38 - good to go now
06:39 - we need to add a button
06:43 - so we need to add a button
06:47 - and for this we are going to simply copy
06:49 - this
06:51 - and we are going to paste it here okay
06:53 - i'll show how you can type this
06:56 - so
07:00 - input type
07:04 - is equal to submit perfectly fine
07:08 - and class is equal to button
07:12 - button primary
07:19 - and i will close this so let me refresh
07:22 - this page
07:24 - yeah so here i have a button and
07:27 - i can style this as a
07:30 - display block
07:33 - if you want or i can do i can do display
07:37 - block or i can do style is able to
07:41 - margin 0 auto so this would align the
07:43 - button to the center
07:45 - margin 0 auto
07:49 - okay and the value is
07:53 - add a
07:57 - to do okay add my two
08:05 - so this is perfectly fine and we can
08:07 - give
08:09 - instead of zero let's make it as one oh
08:11 - sorry
08:14 - okay let's make this as one ram and this
08:17 - would give a margin top
08:18 - so perfectly fine we are good to go with
08:20 - the form as well
08:22 - so this is a very simple form and we are
08:25 - good carry on good with this
08:27 - and now what we can do okay now we can
08:31 - do one thing
08:32 - so uh like like
08:36 - we need to store them inside insider
08:39 - array so heading is perfectly fine
08:42 - so we need to initialize id is equal to
08:45 - one
08:46 - so because our first to do starts with
08:48 - the id one
08:49 - so this is like we are initializing the
08:50 - values
08:52 - and now we are doing title
08:58 - is equal to nothing let this remain this
09:00 - i you can
09:01 - empty string because we don't want
09:03 - something new
09:04 - any title to be given already and
09:08 - done is is going to be false
09:11 - because for when we added to do so we
09:14 - make sure that it's already it is marked
09:16 - as done as
09:17 - also we'll make it as true when we
09:20 - complete it
09:21 - and we store all this in an array
09:24 - named doodles so we'll store all this
09:28 - inside a json object so basically what
09:30 - i'm going to say
09:31 - that we're going to make a json object
09:35 - of id title and done
09:38 - so this is a json object and this json
09:41 - object is going to be stored in this
09:42 - doodle's array so perfectly fine okay
09:46 - so so let me put a comma here so i hope
09:49 - everything
09:50 - is perfect and when i refresh this page
09:52 - ctrl shift i
09:53 - console is perfectly fine so this is how
09:56 - we initialize the value so
09:58 - and we can add to create a method add to
10:02 - do
10:02 - so we'll look how to
10:06 - do complete this function in the next
10:08 - tutorial okay
