00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in this video we will see what
00:05 - is the use of foreign key so before
00:09 - going into further let me show you one
00:13 - example consider this scenario we have
00:17 - two tables one is student table and the
00:22 - another one is department table the
00:25 - student table has two column basically
00:27 - the first one is ID which is also
00:31 - primary key for stir on table and
00:33 - another is name of the student the
00:37 - second table also has two columns the
00:41 - first one is d ID which is department ID
00:45 - and it is the primary key for department
00:51 - table and another is Department name if
00:56 - you observe these example very carefully
00:59 - you can find out that there is a
01:02 - relation between these two tables
01:07 - student obviously belongs to some
01:09 - department some student are pursuing
01:13 - BTech for some student pursuing M Tech
01:16 - and Department for also has a
01:20 - relationship with student because B Tech
01:23 - has some number of student under it and
01:26 - M Tech s so how to link these two tables
01:32 - so here comes the foreign key if you
01:36 - want to link these two tables then we
01:40 - can use foreign key to do so I want to
01:46 - link student table so that there will be
01:51 - added a new column in it and it is
01:55 - nothing but Department ID and we can
01:59 - write that suppose present belong to B
02:02 - Tech ma you know to MTAC Smith also
02:05 - belong to M Tech and Scot belong to beta
02:08 - D ID 1 it means that
02:12 - this one is the department ID and
02:15 - department ID is one then the name of
02:18 - the department is BTech so this is how
02:22 - we can link to levels so let me just
02:27 - close this and open MySQL workbench vo
02:41 - we already have student table and in
02:45 - this we only has primary key for this
02:51 - particular example I will create two new
02:54 - tables first one is department table
03:00 - remember one thing the table which
03:03 - contains the primary key is called
03:07 - parent table and a foreign key is
03:09 - nothing but is a film in one table that
03:13 - refers to the primary key in other W
03:16 - therefore the table containing the
03:18 - foreign key is called digital table and
03:21 - the table that contains the candidate
03:24 - key is called the reference or parent
03:27 - table so in our example parent table
03:31 - will be Department and child table will
03:34 - be student so let me create parent table
03:40 - first because we want that primary key
03:44 - create table the name of the table
03:51 - Department it has the D ID and name
04:05 - we're here let's attend Department ID is
04:14 - primary key okay let me just refresh it
04:23 - yeah yeah we have Department the ID name
04:30 - okay let me create unsuitable student
04:45 - department it has ID as integer name
04:57 - work L 14 Epson primary key will be ID
05:05 - and now foreign key now here comes the
05:10 - part where you can link student deep
05:14 - able to department table simply right
05:17 - currently and first of all we won't we
05:27 - need to add another column which holds
05:30 - this the ID let me call it D ID also and
05:36 - it is a foreign key we found this D ID
05:46 - to store the information about foreign
05:50 - key foreign key D ID this table it
05:53 - refers to it refers to department table
05:57 - so we write references the name of the
06:04 - table
06:08 - the table name is Department and the
06:26 - name of its primary key which is the ID
06:32 - so it's a long query so carefully
06:39 - carefully observe it
06:42 - create table the name of the table ID
06:47 - which is slow roll number basically name
06:52 - D ID which is nothing but the this film
07:02 - then our primary key will be this ID
07:06 - foreign key D ID means the value of this
07:12 - primary key will store here which
07:17 - references department table of the a and
07:23 - find this and we have two table see
07:35 - Department and stood a deep okay let me
07:46 - see the structure mr. Pandey okay it is
08:05 - here okay now let in let me insert some
08:10 - of the values first insert into
08:12 - department table insert into Department
08:24 - values will be one we take let's say
08:35 - okay successful in second Nam insert
08:39 - into soon on deep ID will be 1 0 1 let's
08:47 - say must be Jane and here comes the
08:53 - department ID here if we insert let's
08:59 - say - oops values I fired it then it
09:12 - won't let me insert this value because
09:15 - this 2 has not inserted in department
09:23 - table we have only inserted this one so
09:26 - it cannot find any reference of D ID
09:29 - in department table instead of it if we
09:33 - write 1 then it will be successfully
09:37 - accepted so this is how you can use
09:41 - foreign key constraint to link two
09:43 - tables or multiple tables
09:46 - for watching it
