00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - programming knowledge and this is
00:04 - another video tutorial series and in
00:06 - this particular series were gonna be
00:07 - building an application a very simple
00:10 - application this application will enable
00:13 - us to create read update and delete a
00:16 - particular record in our database so if
00:20 - you're interested and want to learn more
00:21 - about this project stay tuned and surely
00:25 - I will give you all the steps needed to
00:27 - create this particular application by
00:30 - the way guys this is a five-part video
00:31 - tutorial series so if you're new here in
00:33 - our channel please consider subscribing
00:36 - and turn on the notification bells so
00:38 - you get updated whenever we have a new
00:40 - upload so let's go directly to the main
00:43 - content of this video and here we have
00:46 - the expected output of our application
00:49 - so here we have the table displaying all
00:53 - the records of users so for now we have
00:56 - only three records available in our
00:59 - database and we have few options here so
01:02 - for example we have the recycle icon to
01:06 - enable us to delete this if you want to
01:09 - delete this particular record you can
01:11 - delete this if you click on this recycle
01:13 - icon so click and then you will be
01:16 - presented with this confirmation are you
01:19 - sure you want to delete this user so if
01:20 - you really want to delete this user so
01:24 - you just have to click on OK and there
01:27 - you have it
01:28 - user deleted with success ok and then we
01:32 - also have the full name is enabled with
01:35 - a link so if we try to click on the link
01:38 - we will be redirected to another page
01:41 - which is the Edit user so we have here
01:46 - the ID as we cannot edit the ID but we
01:51 - can edit the full name and email address
01:54 - of this particular user and of course
01:57 - here at the left side we have the option
02:01 - to add new user so if we try to add a
02:04 - new user here so say for example the
02:06 - name is John Doe and John Doe gmail.com
02:11 - and click on save
02:13 - so their user inserted with success and
02:18 - we have a new user which is Gendo and we
02:22 - have the email John Doe at gmail.com so
02:26 - this is the expected output of our
02:28 - project I know this is just a very
02:30 - simple application but it will help you
02:32 - get started with PHP jQuery and other
02:36 - underlying technologies that we're gonna
02:38 - use here so this is how the files are
02:41 - organized with this project so we have
02:43 - here the directory for classes directory
02:47 - for CSS database directory for includes
02:51 - and GS and of course this two important
02:56 - files which is deformed at PHP and index
03:00 - dot PHP so under classes we have two
03:03 - files which is database that PHP and
03:06 - user that PHP so I'm gonna be providing
03:09 - you the starter files for this project
03:12 - so you could follow me along with this
03:14 - tutorial so you can find the link in the
03:17 - description below you can download the
03:20 - files or the starter files but for this
03:22 - project and you can follow along with
03:24 - this tutorial so before going any
03:27 - further with our project I'm going to
03:29 - show you first the structure of our
03:31 - database so what I have here is
03:34 - programming knowledge as the database
03:37 - name and the table name is crude
03:40 - underscore users so that's C R u D
03:45 - underscore users and the user or the
03:50 - crude Anasuya users table has three
03:52 - attributes namely ID name and email so
03:58 - the ID is the primary key with the type
04:00 - in and the land is 11 and of course the
04:05 - auto increment is enabled for this
04:07 - particular attribute and of course the
04:10 - second one is the name the type is
04:13 - varchar' of our car which is the land
04:16 - s100 and of course the same with email
04:19 - the length is 100 and type is varchar'
04:23 - of our car for this particular
04:26 - attribute email so that's the structure
04:29 - of our crude underscore users table and
04:32 - all our records will go here and for now
04:35 - let's go back to our editor and start
04:37 - working with our project so the first
04:40 - thing that we're gonna need is to set up
04:41 - our database dot PHP so we're going to
04:44 - create a database class so as you can
04:47 - see I have here the database that PHP
04:49 - file and we have a class database with
04:52 - five attributes for the host name the
04:56 - database name the user name password and
04:59 - this connection variable or connection
05:02 - attribute so we have you the method for
05:05 - the DB connection so we have try and
05:10 - catch clause and of course this is the
05:14 - standard way of connecting to our
05:16 - database we're just going to supply all
05:19 - necessary information such as the host
05:22 - name the database name the username and
05:24 - the password
05:25 - and of course other properties or
05:27 - attributes needed for this connection
05:29 - which is for now we have the PDO
05:31 - attribute error mode is error mode
05:34 - underscore exception and of course video
05:38 - the second attribute is the MySQL
05:40 - attribute initialize command which has
05:42 - set names utf-8 as the character
05:46 - encoding for our connection so that's
05:50 - the basic connection and we're just
05:52 - gonna use this class to connect to our
05:54 - database and of course we're gonna
05:56 - include this or require this database
05:58 - class to our user that page be class so
06:03 - in this file we're gonna require the
06:04 - database class so the first thing is
06:07 - required once and then database that PHP
06:12 - so we can now use the class database in
06:17 - our user dot PHP file so as you can see
06:20 - we have here the class user and inside
06:23 - this class we're going to add several
06:25 - functions such as the constructor the
06:29 - function to execute queries function to
06:32 - insert function to update function to
06:35 - delete and of course another function to
06:37 - redirect by using a
06:39 - URL so the first thing that we're going
06:43 - to add here is the attribute which is
06:49 - private coin and of course the
06:53 - constructor for this particular user
06:55 - class so public function underscore
07:02 - underscore construct okay and then curly
07:07 - braces open and close curly braces
07:10 - inside here we're going to define or
07:15 - create an object for our database class
07:18 - so database equals new database and of
07:23 - course this database we're going to
07:26 - assign this to a new variable which is
07:29 - DB equals database and of course the
07:35 - method to connect to our database which
07:38 - is we have DB connection and then open
07:43 - and close and then let's just assign our
07:46 - attribute connection so this one equals
07:54 - DB okay so another function which is the
07:57 - function to run or as SQL queries so
08:02 - public function and then the name is run
08:09 - query and this accepts SQL statement and
08:15 - of course we're just going to define the
08:18 - statement statement and then the
08:21 - attribute which is the connection and
08:23 - called the method prepare to prepare the
08:29 - statement that we're going to execute
08:31 - and then of course return the statement
08:36 - variable okay so let's just leave this
08:38 - function for now and then we're just
08:40 - going to use this function later on in
08:43 - our project so another function that
08:45 - we're going to create is the insert
08:47 - function so this will be another public
08:50 - function
08:54 - then insert and of course this function
08:59 - accepts the name and of course the email
09:02 - of our user so first let's add the
09:09 - trying catch class for this function so
09:13 - exception e ok so now we have the try
09:22 - and catch and this should be PDO
09:25 - exception and whenever we have an
09:28 - exception with our code we should
09:31 - display this exception by using the e
09:34 - and then getting the message by using
09:37 - the get message function so right here
09:42 - we're going to define the statement and
09:44 - then we're going to use the connection
09:47 - and call the prepare method or function
09:51 - and supply the SQL statement which is
09:56 - insert into table name which is crude
10:01 - users and then we're going to supply the
10:05 - attribute or attributes which are name
10:09 - and email and the values should be named
10:17 - and of course email ok and then of
10:23 - course we need to bind the parameters
10:25 - that we're going to use so statement and
10:29 - then the function bind parameter and of
10:35 - course the name and then of course the
10:39 - variable name the same read the email
10:42 - and this should be email and of course
10:48 - this one should be emailed and then stmd
10:55 - we're going to execute the statement
11:02 - and return as DMT okay so there you have
11:10 - it we now have the public function
11:11 - insert that will enable us to insert the
11:14 - user by using name and email attributes
11:18 - so in the next video we are going to
11:20 - work on with this functions update
11:23 - delete and redirect method
