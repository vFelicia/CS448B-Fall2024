00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in the last few videos we have
00:06 - been seeing how to use services in
00:10 - Android and in this video we will see
00:13 - how to use and create a bound service in
00:17 - Android so let's get started first of
00:20 - all what is a bound service a bound
00:24 - Service is like a server in a client
00:28 - server interface a bound service allows
00:31 - components such as activities to bind to
00:34 - the service send requests receive
00:38 - responses and even perform IPC or
00:42 - interprocess
00:44 - communication okay and there are three
00:48 - ways of creating bound Services first is
00:53 - by extending the binder class which we
00:56 - are going to do in this video second is
01:00 - by using a
01:01 - messenger and third is by using aidl or
01:05 - Android interface definition language
01:09 - these two we will see in the later
01:11 - videos but in this video we are going to
01:14 - create a bind service or bound service
01:18 - by extending a binder class so let's get
01:22 - started I have this blank project and uh
01:27 - there this is just a bare bone own
01:30 - projects and in here first of all what
01:32 - I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
01:35 - service as we always do for creating a
01:38 - service so right click your package and
01:42 - create new and go to services and click
01:47 - service so this is one of the way of
01:49 - creating uh a service in Android okay so
01:53 - just click it and the name of the
01:56 - service class I will leave it as default
01:58 - which is my service
02:00 - and I will finish it and it's going to
02:02 - create this class which extends from
02:05 - service class as we know from our
02:08 - previous videos that if you want to
02:10 - create a service we need to extend from
02:12 - service class and this is our class and
02:15 - this is the onbind method which we uh
02:18 - have to you know Implement when we
02:22 - create our bound service now in which
02:25 - scenarios we want to uh create a bound
02:28 - service by extending the binder class
02:32 - and why or and how we can do it let's
02:36 - see so if your service is private to
02:40 - your own application and runs in the
02:43 - same process as the client which is the
02:46 - most common case and which is uh we have
02:50 - been seeing uh this kind of service
02:52 - Creation in the last videos also then
02:55 - you should create your interface by
02:58 - extending the binder cloud class and
03:01 - returning an instance of it from onbind
03:05 - method which is this method which is
03:09 - automatically generated for us okay now
03:14 - let's uh create the bound service by
03:19 - extending the binder class so first of
03:22 - all we will create a class inside our my
03:27 - service class which will be our public
03:32 - class and I will name it
03:36 - as
03:38 - local binder okay and which extends from
03:44 - the binder class right so
03:53 - binder so this is the class which we
03:55 - want to create and inside this class
03:59 - what we want to do is we create a method
04:03 - which returns my service instance so my
04:07 - service and the method name would be get
04:12 - service and what this is going to do is
04:15 - it's going to return an instance of my
04:19 - service dot
04:23 - this
04:26 - okay and we must return it
04:30 - like this okay now as the the definition
04:35 - says that we need to create our
04:38 - interface by extending from the binder
04:42 - class and returning an instance of it
04:45 - from onbind method so we are going to do
04:49 - the same first of all we are going to
04:51 - create our binder interface so just
04:54 - write public final I binder which is a
04:57 - class for inter facing the binder class
05:02 - and give any name to your binder for
05:05 - example I binder
05:07 - and it we are going to initialize this
05:11 - using our local binder class okay so
05:15 - like this with new okay so is equal to
05:20 - new local binder okay and as it says
05:25 - that we need to return this instance
05:27 - from onbind method so just take this
05:30 - instance of interface and
05:33 - just return it from here so I binder and
05:41 - return okay now for example we want to
05:45 - create a random number generator for our
05:48 - bound service so what we can do is we
05:52 - can create a variable called uh M
05:58 - generator and and which uses this class
06:01 - called random which is used to generate
06:05 - the random numbers right and we are
06:08 - going to initialize it by
06:11 - new
06:15 - random okay now we are going to create a
06:18 - method which is going to return an
06:21 - integer value so
06:23 - public int and we say it's a get
06:32 - random method okay this is going to
06:36 - return this random number generator
06:39 - after generating it okay and in here we
06:42 - want to
06:43 - return the generated random number so
06:47 - just copy your M generator variable and
06:51 - just write dot next int and in the
06:56 - argument of next int just give the ring
06:59 - range in which you want to create the
07:02 - random number for example under 200 you
07:06 - want to create this random number then
07:08 - you just need to give 200 okay so it's
07:11 - going to create the random number
07:13 - between 0 to 200 okay so this is how we
07:18 - can create a bound service using the
07:24 - extension or which extends from the
07:27 - binder class
07:29 - now in our interface or in our activity
07:33 - here what we are going to do is we are
07:35 - going to take a
07:37 - button and the text on it will
07:41 - be
07:44 - get
07:46 - random number okay and we are going to
07:50 - take a large text on which we are going
07:56 - to display this number okay and I I'm
07:59 - going to fill parent so it extends to
08:03 - the width of our screen and now in the
08:07 - main activity. Java file here we can
08:11 - implement this button click event but
08:14 - first of all go to your uh activity and
08:17 - go to your text and in the button here
08:22 - add an enement called on click so
08:24 - Android on click and we can
08:29 - give any method name for example
08:36 - get
08:38 - random number okay and this is the
08:42 - method which we are going to uh
08:44 - Implement so go to your main activity.
08:47 - Java file and in here we are going to
08:50 - first of all create this method which
08:52 - will be
08:55 - public void and the method name and in
08:59 - here
09:05 - View and inside this we are going to
09:09 - return this random number okay now at
09:12 - the top we are going to Define two
09:14 - variables one is the object or instance
09:18 - of my service class so my service object
09:24 - and second is a variable for uh checking
09:28 - if if our service is bound or not so
09:31 - this will be a Boolean variable and we
09:35 - are going to name it as is
09:39 - bound and we are going to initialize it
09:42 - as
09:44 - false now we need to create an object of
09:48 - a class called service connection at the
09:51 - bottom so inside a class go at the
09:54 - bottom and in here create a instance of
09:59 - a class called service connection and we
10:02 - will name it as service connection and
10:05 - we will press Alt Enter to import
10:08 - service connection class and then is
10:11 - equal to new service connection and when
10:16 - you press enter for the first method
10:19 - here it will create two methods
10:22 - automatically for you but you need to
10:24 - give this semicolon here to close it
10:28 - okay and in here you need to uh write
10:32 - some code and in the first line we need
10:35 - to create our local binder object so
10:38 - just create a local binder object local
10:44 - binder and name it something for example
10:48 - binder is equal to we need to cast this
10:52 - local binder so just cast it LO local
10:55 - binder with the service instance s which
11:00 - is here now what we want to do is we
11:03 - want to take this object of my service
11:05 - class copy it and paste it here and we
11:09 - will equate it with this binder do get
11:15 - service okay and one more thing we want
11:17 - to do is we want to take our isbound
11:22 - variable and make it is equal to
11:27 - true and in the on service disconnected
11:31 - method we want to make our isbound
11:36 - variable as
11:38 - false
11:40 - okay now as we always do we want to
11:44 - create an intent for creating our
11:48 - service so go to oncreate Method here
11:52 - and create an intent object so intent
11:57 - intent is equal to to
12:01 - new
12:03 - intent and this intent will take two
12:07 - arguments first is
12:10 - this and second is my service.
12:16 - class okay and now we are going to
12:20 - create a bound service so just write
12:23 - bind service and the first argument of
12:26 - it will be our intent second will be
12:30 - our instance of our service connection
12:35 - instance so this is our service
12:37 - connection instance copy the instance
12:39 - from there and paste it here and third
12:43 - argument will be
12:46 - context
12:49 - dot bind
12:51 - autocreate okay this is the flag now one
12:53 - thing which is remaining now is to
12:57 - display our random number number in our
12:59 - edit text or text view right so we will
13:03 - create an object of text view for
13:07 - example text View and we are going to
13:10 - cast it with text view find view by
13:15 - ID r. ID do our text view
13:23 - name okay and then you just need to take
13:28 - your text View to variable do set text
13:32 - and what we can do here we can use the
13:35 - object of my service class from here and
13:40 - using this we can call our get
13:44 - random function from here it's get
13:48 - random I misspelled it which is G random
13:53 - uh anyway you can name it rename it as
13:56 - get random okay but this this will not
13:59 - work because this is returning an
14:02 - integer and we want to pass to the set
14:06 - text a string variable so what we can do
14:09 - is we can cast this integer to string
14:12 - and how we can do it just write
14:16 - integer dot two
14:20 - string and then inside this bracket just
14:23 - copy this whole method from here and
14:26 - paste it here okay so I hope everything
14:30 - is uh done now so let's uh run our
14:34 - program so our app is running now and
14:37 - I'm going to click this get random
14:40 - number button and it gives me a random
14:43 - number which is 142 once again 62 164
14:47 - and it will keep on giving me this
14:49 - random number until and unless I'm keep
14:52 - on clicking this okay so in this way you
14:56 - can create a bound service in Android I
14:59 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
