00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use switch cases in
00:05 - C as we have seen if statement switch
00:09 - statement is also a conditional
00:12 - statement so if any condition is true
00:16 - the code related to that condition will
00:19 - be executed so let's see how we can use
00:22 - switch cases for the starting code what
00:26 - uh I'm doing is I'm making this code for
00:30 - the students who got some
00:33 - marks and on the basis of marks got by
00:37 - student I want to show some messages so
00:41 - what I'm doing is I'm just printing on
00:43 - the screen please enter the student
00:47 - marks and then what I'm doing is I'm
00:50 - taking the input from the user and I'm
00:53 - converting it to the int value by this
00:56 - int. pass and I'm saving it in into this
01:00 - variable called marks now on the basis
01:03 - of user entered marks I want to show
01:06 - some
01:07 - messages so let's see how we can use
01:10 - switch State switch statement to perform
01:14 - our task the switch statement starts
01:17 - from the keyword
01:19 - switch and with this bracket and in this
01:22 - bracket your condition comes now in our
01:26 - case our condition is marks on the basis
01:30 - of marks we are going to print messages
01:33 - right now after
01:37 - this brackets you need to give these two
01:40 - curly braet brackets to open and close
01:43 - switch case statement and inside these
01:47 - curly braces we write the
01:50 - cases which can be possible so for
01:54 - example
01:58 - case 90 if student get 90 marks then I
02:04 - want
02:05 - to write on the
02:08 - screen on Console
02:13 - do
02:17 - right and I will print this message on
02:20 - the screen
02:32 - excellent okay
02:37 - now after every switch case we can use a
02:41 - optional break so I'll
02:45 - right break
02:47 - here so this break what this break does
02:51 - is it whenever some condition is true
02:55 - then this code is performed and it
02:57 - breaks out of the switch statement and
03:01 - it goes directly here and it performs
03:03 - the other code which is written after
03:05 - this switch
03:06 - statement okay so in this way I will
03:09 - just copy this switch statement and
03:14 - paste it three more times and if the
03:17 - student gets for
03:19 - [Music]
03:20 - example 60 marks I will
03:26 - say
03:28 - very good
03:31 - and if the student
03:33 - gets 30
03:36 - marks then I can write
03:42 - need Improvement okay
03:47 - so if the student will get the 90 marks
03:50 - I will uh just show this ex excellent
03:54 - message if the student gets 60 marks I
03:58 - will show very good and if the student
04:00 - gets 30 marks I will show need
04:03 - Improvement and what this break does is
04:07 - if the condition is true it immediately
04:09 - print this message and it will break the
04:13 - switch cases so break we can use to go
04:17 - out of these switch cases now for
04:21 - example the user has entered some values
04:26 - which is not 90 60 or 30 then for
04:32 - dealing with such cases we use
04:39 - default
04:40 - default and what this default does is it
04:45 - catches all the exception or all the
04:49 - values which are not in these condition
04:52 - which are not provided in these cases
04:55 - okay so this is the default case for us
04:59 - and in the default
05:02 - case I will just write for example I
05:06 - will just copy this paste it here and in
05:09 - the default case I will
05:13 - say
05:16 - please
05:17 - enter
05:19 - valid value
05:22 - okay so in the default case this is the
05:26 - default case and in in this default case
05:29 - what
05:30 - whatever which is not in this Cas is
05:34 - whatever condition which is not followed
05:37 - in this case or this case or this case
05:39 - or any other case will fall into this
05:42 - default okay so now let's try and run
05:46 - the
05:47 - code and I will enter the students marks
05:51 - for example 90 and press enter it shows
05:55 - me the message excellent right but for
05:59 - example I will
06:02 - enter the marks
06:04 - 60 it shows me very
06:07 - good and as in the same way when I will
06:11 - enter 30 it will give me need
06:13 - Improvement but let's
06:16 - see what happens when we enter some
06:20 - value which is not belonging to these
06:22 - cases for example
06:23 - 75 and it says please enter the valid
06:27 - values okay so any value which is not 90
06:32 - 60 or 30 or whatever you enter in this
06:36 - cases uh will not be followed and it
06:40 - will directly go into this default case
06:44 - and this message will be
06:46 - printed and in here in a similar way you
06:49 - can write some function or you can call
06:52 - some some functions you can perform some
06:55 - calculation some some code you can write
06:58 - so it's not necessary that you should
07:00 - only print the value you can perform
07:02 - some calculation you can do some maths
07:05 - you can call some functions so anything
07:08 - which you would like you can do it
07:10 - inside this switch
07:13 - cases now for
07:16 - example if you don't want to use break
07:20 - it's also okay but what will happen then
07:26 - is it will not break here your program
07:29 - will not break here but wherever it sees
07:33 - or your your switch case sees the first
07:36 - break and whenever the condition is true
07:38 - it will show this message so for example
07:42 - I will just
07:44 - remove this break and this message and
07:47 - this break and this message then what do
07:50 - you think what will happen in this case
07:54 - because we don't have provided the break
07:57 - and when you enter 90 it will directly
08:00 - show this message which
08:03 - is need Improvement because it doesn't
08:07 - see break here it doesn't see break here
08:10 - and it will see that first break comes
08:13 - here then it will just show need
08:16 - Improvement so this is a small thing
08:21 - which happens in switch statement if it
08:24 - doesn't sees break point it goes to the
08:27 - next case now for example I want to
08:31 - print the same message I can write like
08:39 - this whatever is the
08:44 - marks
08:47 - okay so
08:49 - now I can write
08:54 - marks entered and when I run the program
08:58 - and for for example I will enter
09:01 - 90 it says marks entered 90 which is
09:06 - this message
09:08 - right because it jumps to the next Cas
09:12 - 60 and it sees here is no break it jumps
09:15 - to 30 and it sees yes here is a break so
09:20 - I need to print this right so switch
09:24 - case works like this it goes to the next
09:27 - case if the break is not pro
09:30 - ided so in this way you can use switch
09:34 - cases in cop I hope you have enjoyed
