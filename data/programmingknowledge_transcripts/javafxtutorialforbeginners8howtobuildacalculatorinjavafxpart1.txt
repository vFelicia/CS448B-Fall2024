00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:04 - JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this
00:06 - video and in the next video I'm going to
00:09 - show you how you can create a simple
00:11 - calculator using JavaFX based on
00:16 - model-view-controller design pattern or
00:19 - MVC design pattern so let's first see
00:23 - how our design will look like and how it
00:27 - will work so we are going to create a
00:30 - calculator something like this okay it's
00:34 - going to have these buttons and these
00:37 - operators and when we add want to add
00:42 - something we can just give the number
00:44 - add to this number and click equal to
00:46 - and it's going to give the sum so it's
00:49 - not going to be very fancy calculator
00:52 - it's a simple calculator but using this
00:55 - we are going to understand the basics of
00:58 - MBC in JavaFX okay so let's get started
01:03 - first of all I will create a new project
01:05 - so new and others and I'm going to
01:10 - create a new Java FX project click Next
01:13 - and this Java FX project I am going to
01:17 - name it as calculator FX for example
01:21 - okay click Next and click finish so our
01:25 - project is created and in the source
01:28 - there is a package called application as
01:30 - we always have and there is a mean dot
01:33 - Java class now let's prepare the basic
01:36 - skeleton of classes we are going to use
01:39 - so I'm going to go to this application
01:42 - package and click new and I'm going to
01:45 - create a new class here and first class
01:48 - I'm going to create is a model class so
01:52 - I will name it as model itself and click
01:55 - finish and second I'm going to create a
01:59 - controller class so right click new
02:02 - class and I will name it as main
02:07 - controller and click finish ok so we
02:12 - have our controller class
02:14 - glass and our main class now we are
02:17 - going to create our F XML file so right
02:20 - click and create new other and create a
02:25 - F XML document so new F XML document and
02:29 - I will name it as mean ok and click
02:32 - finish
02:33 - so now we have all the files which we
02:36 - require so let's create a skeleton of
02:40 - the model and we are going to go to the
02:44 - model and this model is just for the
02:47 - functionality so we want to calculate
02:48 - something in our calculator right so we
02:52 - are going to create this model I will
02:55 - name it as public and the return type
02:59 - will be float for example and it's going
03:03 - to take few arguments but first name our
03:07 - function as calculator or calculate
03:11 - better right so the name of our function
03:14 - is calculate and it's going to take two
03:18 - numbers and data type of these numbers
03:20 - will be long so number one for example
03:24 - and number two and the data type of
03:27 - second number is also long and the third
03:31 - argument it's going to take is the
03:34 - operator and operator we are going to
03:37 - provide in the form of string so just
03:39 - provide a string variable name for
03:43 - example operator okay and for now let's
03:46 - return return zero for now so that it's
03:52 - not going to give you the error of
03:54 - return type but in here in between here
03:58 - we are going to create our code for the
04:01 - calculation but it will be little bit
04:04 - later right and now just go to your main
04:09 - controller class and in here we are
04:11 - going to create two method one will be a
04:15 - public and the return type will be void
04:20 - and I will name it as process numbers
04:25 - okay and as an argument we are going to
04:28 - the action event here and action event
04:31 - should be our JavaFX event right it
04:36 - should not be a WT or swing so just
04:39 - choose the proper option which is JavaFX
04:42 - event action event and give the name to
04:45 - your variable for example event
04:48 - the second method I'm going to create
04:49 - here is the process operators function
04:54 - so process operators right so now we
04:57 - have two classes controller and model in
05:00 - the controller class we have two method
05:03 - one is process number another is process
05:06 - operator and the model we have one
05:09 - method which is calculator and it takes
05:12 - argument one is number one and other is
05:15 - number two and third or argument is here
05:19 - the operator which can be plus minus
05:21 - divide or multiply for example right so
05:26 - now everything is done so let's design
05:29 - our calculator so this is our F XML file
05:34 - so I'm going to right click it and I'm
05:36 - going to open it with the help of scene
05:38 - builder so this is our F XML file which
05:40 - is empty right now and contains this
05:44 - anchor pin so for now I'm going to
05:46 - delete this anchor pin and I'm going to
05:49 - go to this containers category here and
05:52 - I'm going to choose a vertical box or V
05:55 - box and drag and drop here okay and the
05:59 - default size for this I'm going to
06:02 - choose so click here layout and in here
06:05 - the default size is right now 600 by 400
06:08 - I'm going to give it 300 by 300
06:12 - okay so 300 by 300 so the prof wet it's
06:18 - 300 and pref height is 300 and the
06:21 - spacing here I'm going to give it as 10
06:24 - okay so it will resize according to that
06:29 - now inside this vertical box what I am
06:31 - going to do is I'm going to take a stack
06:34 - pin and just drag and drop inside the
06:38 - vertical box and the height of this
06:41 - stack pain I am going to give it as 50
06:45 - okay and then what I'm going to do is
06:50 - I'm going to take the horizontal box or
06:53 - H box so search for H box and I'm going
06:57 - to drag and drop this edge box also just
07:01 - below the stack pin okay so you can see
07:03 - the hierarchy here first parent is V box
07:07 - then the stack pain inside it and then
07:10 - the horizontal box now we are going to
07:13 - change the width and height of this
07:15 - horizontal box also so just go to prep
07:18 - width and give the width of 300 because
07:22 - it's the size of our vertical box so 300
07:25 - by 50 so height will be 50 and provide
07:29 - the spacing of 10 here okay and now we
07:32 - will go to the properties of this
07:34 - horizontal box and the alignment for
07:38 - this will be Center okay
07:41 - so this is our horizontal box now in our
07:44 - H box we are going to take some controls
07:47 - from here and drag and drop some buttons
07:50 - so provides a button and just copy this
07:54 - button and paste it three more times in
07:57 - here so two three and four okay now
08:01 - select all the buttons one by one so I
08:04 - have selected all these four buttons now
08:07 - go to the properties and choose this
08:10 - property called fonts under properties
08:13 - and we are going to change the font size
08:15 - to 18 okay so just choose the font size
08:20 - to 18 now you can see these buttons have
08:24 - some width also so just go to the layout
08:28 - properties of these buttons and in here
08:32 - we are going to provide the width of
08:34 - this button as 50 okay so give 50 width
08:39 - and press Enter so they will look like
08:42 - this now let's save this scene so just
08:47 - go to file and click Save and now we
08:50 - will go to the Eclipse IDE and now we
08:53 - can see here
08:55 - all the buttons are present here right
08:58 - with the font size okay
09:01 - now let's give some text to these
09:04 - buttons so right now the text on these
09:07 - button is the default text which is
09:08 - button so this is our first row of
09:12 - numbers so we can give these text to
09:17 - these buttons seven eight nine and these
09:20 - this divide symbol okay
09:23 - so just give it 7 8 9 and /ok and save
09:33 - it and go to your effects ml file and
09:38 - you can see the text is set here okay so
09:42 - now we are going to do the same for the
09:46 - other rows also so the simple trick for
09:51 - doing it this is just copy your
09:54 - horizontal box so just copy this from
09:57 - here and then paste it once again here
10:01 - okay once again and once again so we
10:06 - have 4 rows of numbers okay now the
10:10 - second row of numbers here we can see
10:13 - here 4 5 6 and s tricks so just save
10:17 - your F XML file so just go file and save
10:21 - and then go to your next Eclipse and
10:24 - here you will see for a horizontal box
10:27 - first is this one which we have already
10:30 - given these number 7 8 9 and /tu the
10:35 - second horizontal box buttons we will
10:37 - give these number 4 5 6 and s tricks so
10:40 - just give 4 5 6 and the asterisk symbol
10:48 - and then the third row we will give 1 2
10:52 - 3 and minus symbol so 1 2 3 and minus
11:01 - and the fourth row is 0 equals 2 and
11:08 - Plus right so the fourth row has only 3
11:11 - buttons 0 equals 2 and minus 1 so I'm
11:15 - going to delete the 4th button from here
11:18 - from the 4th row so that it has only 3
11:21 - buttons and first will be 0 second will
11:25 - be the equal to button and third will be
11:29 - the addition button right now save it
11:32 - and go to your scene builder and you can
11:36 - see this layout like this now let's
11:41 - provide the width of this zero button so
11:45 - we will go to the F XML file from here
11:48 - and instead of giving the width of 50 to
11:51 - the zero button we provide the width of
11:53 - one 110 because we are going to cover
11:57 - two button width from this plus the
12:00 - space so it's going to be 100 plus 10
12:03 - which is 100 tens so save it and go to
12:07 - the scene builder and we can see the
12:09 - width of this zero button has changed so
12:13 - these are all the buttons now in the
12:15 - stack pane just choose the stack pane
12:17 - and in here we are going to take a label
12:21 - so just take a label from here from the
12:24 - controls and drag and drop into the
12:28 - stack pane
12:29 - ok and you can resize this label
12:33 - according to the width of the stack pane
12:36 - and the font size we are going to
12:38 - provide it from the property so go to
12:40 - the property and provide the font size
12:42 - same as buttons so we will provide the
12:45 - font size of 18 here ok and let's say
12:51 - it's a bold font okay and the text of
12:56 - this font I'm going to just leave it as
13:00 - blank right so this is how your design
13:03 - will look like so we are going to see
13:05 - the preview so just click preview here
13:08 - and it's going to look like this ok now
13:11 - one thing which remains here is we need
13:15 - to add this mean dot F XML file to our
13:17 - main dot Java file so just open this
13:21 - main dot
13:21 - Java and instead of using this border
13:25 - pin which is by default added we are
13:28 - going to add the parent route right so
13:32 - just add this line here parent route is
13:36 - equal to FXM el loader dot load inside
13:40 - the bracket get class dot get resources
13:43 - and the part to your F XML file which is
13:46 - in application slash mean dot F XML just
13:50 - add these imports from here import F XML
13:53 - loader so the basic layout for our
13:55 - project is done so we will save it and
13:59 - run it and our calculator layout will
14:03 - look something like this okay now that's
14:08 - it for this video in the next video we
14:10 - are going to add the functionality to
14:13 - this calculators we are going to write
14:16 - the code for these two methods and this
14:20 - model method okay so stay tuned and
14:23 - please rate comment subscribe and bye
14:25 - for now
