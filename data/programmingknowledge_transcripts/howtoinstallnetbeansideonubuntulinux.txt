00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - netbeans
00:05 - on your ubuntu operating system
00:08 - so let's get started so the prerequisite
00:11 - of installing netbeans on your ubuntu
00:13 - operating system
00:14 - is you need to have java installed on
00:16 - your ubuntu operating system
00:19 - so if you don't have java just install
00:21 - java i have
00:22 - already created a video about how you
00:25 - can install java on your ubuntu
00:26 - operating system
00:27 - so if you don't know how to install java
00:30 - i will put the link of that video in the
00:32 - description of this video so you can
00:34 - directly see this
00:35 - so let's check whether java is installed
00:38 - on our
00:39 - ubuntu operating system so to check it
00:41 - you can just
00:42 - press ctrl alt t to open the terminal
00:45 - on your ubuntu operating system or you
00:48 - can
00:49 - just search for the terminal in the
00:52 - applications so the check is very simple
00:55 - you just need to write
00:56 - java hyphen hyphen version
01:00 - and you can see i have java 15.0.2
01:03 - installed on my ubuntu operating system
01:06 - but if it gives no response
01:10 - then you need to install java right so
01:13 - once you have already installed a java
01:15 - on your system
01:16 - we are ready to install netbeans on our
01:19 - ubuntu operating system
01:20 - so now let's check which is the latest
01:22 - version of netbeans which is available
01:24 - for download
01:26 - so i'm going to just search for netbeans
01:28 - download
01:29 - and the first link which will appear
01:30 - here will be from netbeans.apache.org
01:34 - download so i'm going to just click on
01:36 - this link
01:37 - and you can see the latest release right
01:40 - now
01:41 - is 12.02
01:44 - at the time of making this video so we
01:46 - are going to download
01:47 - this version of netbeans on our ubuntu
01:51 - operating system
01:52 - now you can see that this
01:56 - download button is available here but we
01:58 - are not going to download
02:01 - this netbeans from this website
02:04 - i'm going to show you the simpler way of
02:07 - installing netbeans on your ubuntu
02:09 - operating system
02:10 - and that is by using a utility called
02:13 - snap so snap is essentially a package
02:17 - manager
02:18 - to install and manage your
02:22 - apps on different kind of linux
02:24 - operating systems
02:26 - so let me clear the terminal and to
02:29 - search for the netbeans using snap
02:33 - you can just write snap and
02:36 - then find and then just write net
02:40 - beans here and then press enter which is
02:42 - going to show you
02:44 - the version of netbeans available using
02:47 - snap so you can see
02:48 - the version available for the snap is
02:51 - 12.02
02:53 - which we have seen on the official
02:55 - website also so this is the latest
02:57 - version
02:57 - so to install netbeans on your ubuntu
03:00 - operating system
03:01 - using snap you just need to give this
03:03 - command which is
03:05 - sudo snap install netbeans
03:08 - and then hyphen hyphen classic here
03:10 - which is going to essentially install
03:12 - the latest version
03:13 - available on snap right just
03:17 - provide your ubuntu's uh password and
03:19 - then press enter which is going to start
03:21 - the download
03:22 - of this netbeans on your ubuntu
03:25 - operating system so just wait for the
03:27 - download to complete so now i can see
03:29 - that
03:29 - netbeans 12.2 from apache netbeans has
03:33 - been successfully installed
03:35 - so if you see this message that means
03:37 - netbeans is successfully installed on
03:39 - your ubuntu operating system
03:41 - so i'm going to minimize uh this
03:43 - terminal
03:44 - and i can go to the applications once
03:47 - again
03:48 - and here you will be able to find
03:50 - netbeans
03:51 - you can see this icon for the netbeans
03:54 - if you don't find the netbeans icon you
03:56 - can also
03:57 - search for netbeans and you will be able
04:00 - to see this netbeans
04:02 - icon so i'm going to just click on this
04:03 - icon which is going to start
04:05 - netbeans on my ubuntu operating system
04:08 - so now let's uh
04:09 - create a java project using netbeans ide
04:13 - to check
04:14 - whether everything is working fine or
04:16 - not so here i'm going to just click on
04:19 - the
04:19 - file option and then i'm going to click
04:21 - on new project
04:23 - and then i'm going to select java with
04:26 - maven on the left hand side and
04:29 - the project type will be java
04:31 - application and then click on next
04:34 - and now on the next window it says in
04:37 - order to use this functionality
04:39 - support for java sc must be activated
04:42 - so i'm going to just check this check
04:44 - box and then click on download and
04:47 - activate
04:48 - and then i'm going to wait for some time
04:50 - until i see
04:51 - success message for this activation so
04:53 - now i can see this message which says
04:55 - welcome to netbeans plugin installer the
04:58 - following plugin will be installed
05:01 - and this is the plugin name so i'm going
05:02 - to just click on next here
05:05 - and then accept license terms and
05:07 - conditions
05:08 - and then click on install and once this
05:10 - is done i'm going to just click on
05:12 - finish
05:12 - now i can see the next window where i
05:15 - can
05:16 - provide the name of my project by
05:19 - default it's called
05:20 - maven project one i will leave it as
05:22 - default you can
05:24 - change this name according to your
05:26 - preferences
05:27 - also this will be the location where
05:29 - your project will be
05:30 - uh saved and then the group id is
05:33 - com.mycompany i will leave everything as
05:36 - default because i just want to check
05:37 - whether
05:38 - everything is working fine or not so i'm
05:40 - going to just click
05:41 - on finish here which is going to create
05:45 - my project
05:46 - so this is my project which is created
05:49 - so i'm going to just
05:50 - expand this and under the source
05:53 - packages
05:54 - i can see this one package which
05:57 - is created so i'm going to create a new
05:59 - class under this package so
06:01 - just right click on this package and
06:03 - then click on
06:04 - new and then select java class
06:08 - and then give the name of your java
06:10 - class i'm going to name my class as
06:12 - let's say hello
06:14 - and then i'm going to just click on the
06:17 - finish button
06:18 - so now you can see this hello
06:21 - dot java class is created
06:24 - so inside this hello class i'm going to
06:26 - create a public static void main so i
06:28 - will
06:29 - just write psvm
06:33 - and then i'm going to press ctrl space
06:36 - which is going to give me this
06:39 - option to create this method so i'm
06:42 - going to just click on this
06:43 - and this method is created and inside
06:46 - this main method i'm going to just
06:48 - type system dot
06:51 - out dot print line and then i'm going to
06:55 - just print hello world for example
06:58 - once i have this code i'm going to just
07:00 - save this code by just pressing
07:03 - ctrl s and now i'm going to build and
07:05 - run it
07:06 - so to build it you can just press on
07:08 - this hammer button which is going to
07:11 - build your maven project so whenever
07:14 - you build your project for the first
07:17 - time
07:18 - it downloads some packages from the
07:21 - repository so it will take
07:23 - a little bit more time but from the next
07:26 - time
07:27 - when you just compile and run it it will
07:30 - be faster so now the build is successful
07:33 - so let's run it by just clicking on this
07:36 - green run button and then click on
07:38 - select main class
07:40 - which is going to just run our
07:42 - application
07:43 - and show you the output so now i can see
07:46 - this hello world
07:47 - message here so everything is working
07:50 - fine now
07:51 - right so this is how you can download
07:53 - and install and use
07:54 - netbeans ide on your ubuntu operating
07:58 - system
07:58 - i hope you enjoyed this video and i will
08:00 - see you in the next video
