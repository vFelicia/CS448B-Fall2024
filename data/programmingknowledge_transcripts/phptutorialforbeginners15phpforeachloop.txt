00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use for each Loop in
00:05 - your PHP code okay so there is one more
00:09 - kind of a loop called for each Loop
00:12 - which is also used for iterating values
00:15 - uh in your PHP code so for example I
00:20 - have shown you in the previous video how
00:22 - to declare an array right for example I
00:26 - have an array of these
00:28 - names and what uh this array contains
00:33 - three names for example I can add one
00:36 - more name for
00:42 - example and one more
00:45 - name this has five names
00:50 - right okay so this name array has five
00:54 - name in it and I want to uh print all
00:58 - the names one by one without using the
01:03 - key of these elements how can I do it I
01:07 - can use for each Loop and how you can
01:09 - declare for each Loop
01:13 - for each and then the condition and then
01:18 - these curly braces you can declare it
01:21 - like this and here you can give the name
01:26 - of the
01:27 - array or whatever value you want to
01:30 - iterate and then give a keyword as and
01:35 - then declare your own variable which
01:38 - will contain these name one by one so I
01:43 - will say this is a name instead of names
01:47 - this is names which last from which has
01:51 - the ending with s and this is a name you
01:55 - can uh name it anything but logically I
01:58 - name it as name and this variable will
02:02 - contain this name one by one okay so
02:06 - basically what we are saying here in uh
02:09 - in using for each Loop that give me from
02:13 - this array every element one by one and
02:18 - pass it here one by one so that we can
02:21 - use it so for example I want to print
02:23 - this I can just
02:25 - write
02:27 - Echo and then
02:31 - then I can just uh use my name variable
02:36 - here and I can concatenate this with a
02:39 - break so that it will be easier to see
02:43 - BR okay I save it and when I run
02:48 - this I see an error let's see
02:53 - why okay I haven't provided this
02:56 - semicolon here okay just provide the sem
02:59 - me colon here and run the program once
03:02 - again and it gives me all the names one
03:05 - by one Whatever names are there in the
03:10 - list so this for each Loop we use it to
03:15 - iterate the values or elements in the
03:18 - array one by one okay and this uh
03:22 - elements will be contain in this
03:25 - variable which you declare after as okay
03:29 - so this is single dimensional array and
03:32 - you can iterate it easily but what if
03:37 - it's a multi-dimensional array and if
03:41 - it's a multi-dimensional array uh in the
03:45 - I think uh in the previous video I've
03:47 - shown you how to use multiple
03:49 - dimensional arrays so for example we
03:51 - have this multi-dimensional array from
03:54 - our previous videos so I will delete all
03:57 - this code from here and
04:00 - if you remember we have declared this uh
04:03 - multi-dimensional array in the video
04:07 - where we have seen how to use this
04:09 - multiple dimensional array right now if
04:12 - you want to uh iterate this value how
04:14 - you can do it because this is in Array
04:17 - inside an array and then the values of
04:20 - array in
04:22 - associative array right so you can do it
04:27 - something like this you can just
04:30 - right
04:32 - for each and give a Loops something like
04:37 - this and inside this I will just first
04:40 - of all name my
04:42 - array my basic array is this
04:46 - as
04:47 - my variable name whatever I want to
04:51 - iterate the elements of the array so I
04:54 - can say
04:55 - student this is
04:57 - students right and this will
05:00 - be this will contain student right and
05:06 - so what are there in the
05:10 - student we have three different values
05:14 - inside our student array so this is the
05:17 - student this is the array and we have
05:20 - three different value one two and three
05:25 - right and the key of this value is zero
05:31 - key of this value is one and key of this
05:34 - value is two so whenever we uh whenever
05:38 - we Echo
05:40 - this Echo and whenever we uh Echo
05:45 - student dot
05:50 - break BR and when we save it and run it
05:54 - it'll give us the key of this once again
05:57 - I think I forgot this one one save
06:02 - it and it will give the key hopefully
06:07 - no so it's giving us error because we
06:12 - need
06:13 - to indicate somehow that it has some
06:18 - array inside it you can see the error
06:21 - that the value you are trying to show is
06:24 - an array so it will not print this
06:26 - because you print string values using
06:29 - this Echo right so you need to write
06:31 - here equal
06:33 - to like this and then you can say this
06:38 - is my so this student
06:41 - contain a array which has three element
06:45 - and then inside this we have another
06:47 - array which is this student and then we
06:50 - want to iterate the value of this right
06:53 - so we can say this is
06:56 - a in
06:58 - a
07:00 - array or whatever you want to say it and
07:04 - then whenever you want you print
07:07 - this then let's see what
07:12 - happens I want to save this for
07:17 - example okay so for now we use this here
07:22 - and I save
07:23 - it that gives me index 012 right so this
07:29 - is giving me the key of this array this
07:33 - has three uh three values which has the
07:37 - key zero one and two now I want to
07:40 - iterate the value here these all values
07:44 - how I can do it now I have all the
07:47 - values in here for array one array two
07:50 - and array three so what I can do is I
07:53 - can use for each Loop inside for each
07:56 - Loop second for each Loop here to
07:59 - iterate the values of inner
08:02 - arrays okay so I just Echo it like this
08:07 - but this time I want to use this inner
08:10 - array as
08:13 - my primary array as for example
08:18 - items or item item is a more lo logical
08:23 - thing and I will make
08:26 - this bold
08:29 - so I will just make this bold so that we
08:33 - will be able to see
08:35 - this
08:37 - B and here we will end our B like this
08:44 - okay so let's see what happens I just
08:48 - save it and I run
08:52 - this
08:57 - and I need to give here
08:59 - concatenation
09:02 - operator and now you can
09:05 - see our zeroth uh key contains these
09:10 - values Mark as a name weight 15 and uh
09:15 - age 15 and weight uh 46 then
09:20 - John we age 13 and weight 65 Tom age 14
09:26 - and weight this one so in this way you
09:28 - can it rate the multi-dimensional array
09:31 - using for each Loop but you have need to
09:34 - use uh two for each Loop one to iterate
09:39 - this array outer array which contains
09:42 - three keys and other to uh uh iterate
09:47 - the values of second array okay so in
09:52 - this way you can use for each Loop in
09:54 - PHP I hope you have enjoyed this video
09:56 - please R comment and subscribe and bye
09:58 - for now
