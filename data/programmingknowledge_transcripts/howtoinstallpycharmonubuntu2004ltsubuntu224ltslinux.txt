00:12 - need to obviously have python installed
00:14 - on your ubuntu operating system by the
00:16 - way if you don't know pycharm pycharm is

02:07 - terminal
02:07 - once again let me clear the terminal
02:11 - and here we are going to use a utility
02:14 - called

02:18 - using which you can install and manage
02:20 - different kind of softwares and packages
02:23 - right so you can just write uh

03:32 - then press enter which is going to start
03:34 - the download
03:36 - and the installation process for the
03:39 - pycharm ide

03:42 - community edition is installed
03:44 - on my ubuntu operating system so i can
03:46 - close this terminal
03:48 - and now i can open the pycharm ide
03:52 - by just going to the applications and
03:55 - then
03:56 - i can directly see the pycharm menu here
04:00 - or i can just search for it so i can see
04:03 - this pie charm menu or you can just
04:06 - search for pie charm and then click on
04:10 - this icon from here
04:11 - and for the first time when pycharm
04:13 - starts on your ubuntu operating system
04:15 - it's going to
04:16 - show you this kind of window which says
04:18 - import pycharm settings
04:20 - so if you have previous versions of
04:23 - pycharm
04:23 - installed on your ubuntu operating
04:25 - system you can
04:27 - import those settings into your new
04:30 - pycharm
