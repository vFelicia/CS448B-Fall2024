00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line to total beginners in
00:05 - this video we will learn how to use
00:07 - graph command in Linux graph sense for
00:11 - global regular expression print now
00:14 - graph graph command processes text line
00:18 - by line and print any line which matches
00:21 - our specified pattern
00:23 - so grab command can be used to search
00:26 - some kind of pattern or word or sentence
00:30 - in a text file or number of text file
00:33 - using this graph command and some
00:36 - options with graph c'mon so let's see
00:39 - how we can use grab command so first of
00:42 - all I need to have for example compile
00:45 - to use this crap command so I'm going to
00:48 - just change my directory to desktop
00:52 - first of all and then here I am going to
00:55 - create a file for example what I'm going
00:58 - to do is I'm going to use man and I'm
01:01 - going to use star and I'm going to dump
01:04 - the man page of star to a file for
01:09 - example I'm going to name it as file dot
01:11 - txt okay and then press ENTER it is
01:15 - going to create file you can see the
01:18 - file is created and when I'm going to
01:20 - open this file it's going to show the
01:22 - kind of man command output for the town
01:26 - right now I can use grab command on this
01:32 - file so I'm going to clear the terminal
01:34 - first of all and then let's open this
01:39 - file and let's see what we want the
01:41 - source for example for example I want to
01:44 - search for this word in this file called
01:47 - option right so I can use this command
01:50 - grab and then the pattern which I want
01:56 - to search for for example I want to
01:59 - search for options right so I will just
02:02 - write options here and then the name of
02:05 - the file in which I want to search my
02:08 - pattern in okay
02:11 - so grap and then the word I want to
02:14 - search and then the file name and then
02:17 - press ENTER and you can see it has
02:20 - searched the line which are containing
02:24 - the option key word right and when I
02:28 - open this file again we're going to show
02:31 - up so you can see this line is
02:35 - containing the option so this line has
02:38 - the spot name also so you can see this
02:40 - line is printed and then let's search
02:44 - here in the G edit editor also then you
02:48 - can see this line also contain 2 or
02:50 - option key word which is this line right
02:53 - and then we will go down you can see the
02:58 - options with the capital letter is not
03:01 - such because this crap command is case
03:04 - sensitive by default but we can use a
03:08 - flag called I to make it case
03:11 - insensitive and we are going to see in
03:13 - the next command but this will not be
03:17 - searched because the graph command is
03:21 - case sensitive right we will go little
03:24 - bit down and hopefully we see the next
03:28 - option line this is the next options
03:32 - line this is this one right so all the
03:35 - line containing option keyword is
03:37 - searched and printed right now I was
03:41 - talking about the case sensitive option
03:45 - right so to make the graph command to
03:50 - look for case insensitive word also so
03:54 - capital loss small the matter you can
03:57 - use eyes lab with it ok so if you use I
04:01 - flag then it's going to search for
04:03 - capital loss small letter words and when
04:07 - I print ENTER you can see it search for
04:11 - small letter options mine also and you
04:14 - can see it searches for the capital
04:16 - letter options keyboard also right now
04:21 - for example I want to print
04:24 - the line number in which this result is
04:28 - appearing so I want to print the first
04:31 - of all line number and then the result
04:33 - so I can use the option called the for
04:37 - example N and is for printing the line
04:41 - number right I can adjust remove this I
04:44 - which is for case in some particular
04:46 - right and when I print enter you can see
04:49 - on the line 9 I have this option then 17
04:55 - and then 348 so I can prove this by just
05:00 - saying this so you can see this is line
05:03 - 9 you can see here line 9 column 29
05:08 - right and then next is 17 here you can
05:11 - see line number right so join the
05:14 - collect result well now next is the
05:20 - flack we can use to for example we can
05:23 - use multiple you know keyword here also
05:28 - so it doesn't you know it's not
05:32 - necessary that this has to be a word it
05:35 - can be a sentence also right so for
05:38 - example I will do it once again and this
05:41 - time instead of option I will just see
05:45 - in the text what I want to search for
05:47 - example so I want to search for some
05:50 - options line okay not the keyword option
05:55 - but the sentence for example some option
05:57 - and instead of options I will just give
06:01 - this keyword called some option so come
06:05 - option and then click enter I just shows
06:09 - the line which contains this pattern
06:12 - which is some option so once again the
06:16 - line number is 17 as we know it
06:19 - search for this line only okay
06:23 - so this is also you can use you know
06:27 - graph command so you can also use graph
06:31 - command visit multiple file so let me
06:34 - clear the terminal
06:36 - and let me copy this file into different
06:40 - files so for example file two and then
06:45 - I'm going to create file three also for
06:48 - example and then file for also okay and
06:53 - then I want to search in these all four
06:57 - files something so let's search for this
07:00 - same option in different files so you
07:06 - can use the same command grab and - any
07:09 - for line number and then your pattern or
07:11 - sentence whatever you want to search and
07:13 - then the file name so it can be for file
07:16 - name and then while - for example and
07:21 - then file 3 if you want to certain file
07:23 - 3 and also file for if you want to
07:26 - search in file for and then press Enter
07:28 - and now you can see it giving the name
07:32 - of the file for and then the 9 number so
07:35 - file look dot txt contains just a
07:38 - pattern then file - dot txt contains
07:42 - this pattern on this line then file 3
07:45 - contains this on this line and then file
07:48 - for also contains on this you know this
07:52 - pattern on this line right now this
07:55 - command you have to type all the file
07:58 - names right this can be made simpler
08:02 - with a wild-card so instead of writing
08:05 - this when you use s click it means all
08:09 - the files in this folder right so it
08:12 - means so v 1 v 2 v 3 and file for
08:15 - because these are the file which are
08:18 - there in the Desktop folder so this
08:20 - Astrix means that it's a wild card and
08:23 - it means that it's going to search for
08:26 - all the files and press Enter it's going
08:29 - to search or give the same result
08:33 - - you okay now sometimes you want to
08:38 - search for the line for example in the
08:43 - inverse manner so just search for the
08:46 - line which doesn't contain this pattern
08:49 - for example
08:50 - right so you can use a flag let me clear
08:53 - the terminal first of all and once again
08:55 - use a graph command and then whenever
08:59 - you use this V flag it means invert
09:04 - match which means that all the you know
09:07 - lines which doesn't contain this pattern
09:11 - is going to show these lines okay so
09:15 - it's the invert match okay and let me
09:19 - just you only one file for now file dot
09:23 - exe in then press enter
09:25 - it's showing all the line which doesn't
09:28 - contain this word which we are searching
09:31 - for let me also show the line number
09:34 - also so 10 I'm going to show the line
09:37 - number so it's only showing the line
09:41 - which doesn't contain the keyword which
09:44 - is some options right you can verify
09:47 - from here the terminal is not printing
09:50 - all the you know lines right but when
09:54 - you verify it it's not going to show you
09:57 - the line number 17 because this contains
10:00 - the term pattern which we are searching
10:04 - for okay so there are many are you know
10:08 - flags and options which you can use it
10:11 - graph command I just wanted to give you
10:14 - the introduction the gap crap command so
10:16 - go ahead and just use gap - H - that's
10:21 - right graph - H here and then press
10:25 - Enter it shows that to use help you need
10:29 - to use this command so not - H but graph
10:33 - - - help okay just use this - myself and
10:37 - then it's going to show you all the flag
10:40 - and options which you can use with the
10:44 - you know graph command
10:46 - so I hope you enjoyed this video please
