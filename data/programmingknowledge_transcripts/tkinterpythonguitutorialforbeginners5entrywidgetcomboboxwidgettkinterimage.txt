00:01 - hallo guys are welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in the previous video we
00:05 - learned about the creating a basic
00:08 - window grow adding labels that is the
00:10 - first name and the last name and Hideko
00:13 - buttons to a specific window so on move
00:17 - on further in this video we'll be
00:20 - learning about how to provide enter
00:22 - wittich to a window that is for the
00:24 - first name last name and also we'll be
00:27 - including on two more label stat is the
00:31 - date of birth widget label and the
00:34 - country and the country will be a
00:36 - specifically a combo box so it drop down
00:38 - this kind of things so let's begin so
00:44 - and also will you see how you can add an
00:49 - image to a kinder window using the
00:52 - library pillow so follow with me and
00:59 - initially you will have to install if
01:03 - you go on how below that is a image
01:05 - processing library in Python so follow
01:10 - our from PIL in both images comma image
01:28 - TK so in Python
01:33 - now you can use image in a label using
01:38 - this specific format sorry it means
01:45 - right and common sorry okay so for
01:52 - install
01:53 - hello you just need to type in pip
01:57 - install below that's it so on this
02:06 - library pillow is used for image adding
02:09 - an image into a kinter window so this is
02:12 - how you can
02:13 - install pip install a pillow in Python
02:19 - so at this and now you just have to use
02:25 - a variable that is image or you can say
02:31 - that image is equal to let's say it as
02:36 - image dot open so here we are I'm
02:43 - specifying the part of an image that
02:45 - which we are going to be used in the
02:47 - camper window so bracket and photo is
03:01 - equal to image P K dot o go and image so
03:15 - here we are passing this particular
03:17 - variable that is image in this argument
03:22 - so now we'll be specifying the image
03:27 - path so for that we are taking an image
03:30 - that is a PNG file so copy this path and
03:38 - provide it over here as an argument
03:43 - slash so or you can just create a folder
03:53 - and add within that in the folder with
03:57 - the antimage is in that folder so it
04:00 - will be easy as issue just you have to
04:02 - mention the image name with the file
04:07 - extension
04:17 - and toward the main thing mail what is
04:24 - the name I guess female or PNG right so
04:28 - female male dot P and G and we also that
04:38 - it so this how you can to mention all
04:42 - mention a part of an image into a
04:45 - variable and passing it it is passing
04:50 - this as an argument in this variable
04:53 - photo right now we'll be taking a
04:57 - variable that is for a label so lab is
05:06 - equal to the label and image is equal to
05:14 - the photo and we'll be using back or
05:22 - keeping keeping it in the center sorry
05:32 - yep so this is how you can place an
05:38 - image put in a kingdom on those so let's
05:41 - see what is the output so this cording
05:50 - and error and telling it tells okay okay
05:57 - so it is oh the arrow over here is just
06:00 - photo image so you just need to cover
06:02 - photo image so if these are like an
06:05 - inbuild method between two for passing
06:08 - an image into a variable so let's fund
06:12 - this so as you can see this is the image
06:18 - which we are using and passing it into
06:23 - this particular variable so this is how
06:25 - you can use an image within a kinder
06:27 - window you are wire the library
06:31 - PIL so now coming on to the midgets
06:35 - introverted so we'll be using basically
06:41 - to enter widgets and one combo box so
06:46 - let's dive into it so entry on disco one
06:57 - is equal to entry ma route and providing
07:09 - it text variable so I'll just show you
07:12 - what is the use of that variable
07:15 - basically and and this provide a place
07:22 - to it so unless Co one dot place and X
07:31 - is equal to twelve as 240 and Y is equal
07:39 - to 240 to so let's see what is the
07:45 - output so FN is not actually mentioned
07:51 - so what is FN over here so f and over
07:56 - here is something called as a variable
07:59 - useful or fetching out the details from
08:02 - it text widget sorry an entry visit so
08:06 - just mentioned FN is equal to a string
08:14 - variable string wah close so now let's
08:20 - try and see so you can see this is an
08:23 - enter visit with a text variable FN
08:26 - right so what this string variable will
08:32 - do is that it will fetch the input given
08:37 - by a user for example I'm type having
08:41 - some name that is demo
08:44 - so what the variable FM will do is that
08:48 - it will take the texture demo and use it
08:51 - somewhere when when it is required so do
08:56 - be more clear then I'll just go through
08:59 - the following so now I'll be using this
09:03 - entry widget for two more of one more I
09:06 - guess ok so just copy down this copy and
09:17 - go out the same for the last change the
09:22 - value that is two and to change the
09:28 - position two so for entry 2 it will be
09:33 - 240 and 282 right so let's see the value
09:46 - for this is also it and for the last
09:52 - name will be taking as variable Ln and
09:57 - same like we did for the first name
10:00 - we'll take Ln is equal to string 1 right
10:08 - okay now now the using a combo box so
10:17 - just dive into the so now I will show
10:23 - the output and we get so one more entry
10:27 - free will need that is for the date of
10:29 - birth right so let's make another entry
10:32 - field copy that one and paste it below
10:40 - this rename it and
10:48 - change the position that is to 320 right
10:57 - read on it and see what is the output so
11:02 - it is it looks good and now I use a
11:07 - combo box so I just show you how you can
11:10 - use one right and also provide a string
11:14 - variable like we did over here so for
11:17 - the date of birth you will be using T Oh
11:21 - be write the variable and just mention
11:27 - it over here the d OB r is equal to
11:32 - string one right okay so now we'll be
11:46 - getting into the comma box right okay so
11:57 - for a combo box
11:59 - first of all just create a list so here
12:02 - we need a list of countries right so for
12:06 - that just create a list of countries
12:08 - that is list 1 is equal to ona pal
12:22 - common India those are strings so comma
12:35 - Canada okay so this is the list of
12:44 - countries and the second procedure is
12:47 - chopped down less so here we are taking
12:52 - this variable drop list is equal to so
12:57 - the in will metal for although in do
13:00 - argument for creating a drop-down list
13:02 - or a combo box is option menu right and
13:11 - same procedure route comma the very
13:17 - variable name comma and the list so here
13:21 - we are looking through the entire list
13:23 - so star sorry list 1 okay now drop list
13:36 - or take it as a dot set so we really
13:41 - something that let me it's like a
13:43 - placeholder for the vigil trade so you
13:46 - see in a second select country and just
13:55 - go add a position to it list dot config
14:16 - and provide a place that says equal to
14:32 - 230 and Y is equal to 378 so let's see
14:47 - what is the output so before that we'll
14:52 - just create the same for string 1 is
14:56 - equal to string variable okay save it
15:01 - and run so you can see this is the
15:06 - output a drop-down or a combo oldest
15:12 - looking through the list
15:14 - provided the Distilled is to one may
15:16 - call India you can add as per your
15:18 - preference and provide for position so
15:21 - this is actually method of creating a
15:28 - combo box in kinder the top down list
15:32 - and go adding a placeholder for it okay
15:38 - so now what we'll do is that we'll be
15:44 - using this variables which we are
15:47 - creating over here that is okay for DOP
15:53 - and now 1 for 1 is equal to string
16:01 - variable right don't need to mention it
16:05 - twice but it looks decent so define
16:15 - provide the name friend
16:24 - so take a variable first for getting the
16:29 - input from the first entry widget that
16:32 - is for the first name F and dot get now
16:45 - we'll take second for the last name Ln
16:49 - not get and for where or the DOB date of
16:58 - birth is leave OB just nimittas
17:07 - different we dot get okay then provides
17:13 - where one for another variable and we'll
17:15 - provide well not get okay now we'll
17:22 - print the values that is print
17:26 - using a strings over here so if you're
17:29 - familiar with that it's good full name
17:37 - is the first and second right similarly
17:53 - we will do this for so let's come over
18:04 - here and b.o.b 1 bar 1 your country and
18:34 - your age ok so this is a function that
18:43 - which we have created to print the
18:45 - things from the widget to a poopa to
18:47 - this console right so let's see whether
18:51 - it works or not we'll be using this
18:54 - particular function in this button so
19:01 - comma command is equal to print so let's
19:12 - see whether it works or not
19:15 - so I guess there is no errors but let's
19:19 - see whether it prints on one demo test
19:26 - quite a date of birth this is some
19:32 - random
19:33 - visit so don't worry about it providing
19:38 - India and pip to the Sangha button let's
19:42 - see what is the output so the code works
19:47 - so whatever we type think of widgets
19:51 - that is a demo test the date of birth
19:54 - and the country is printed over here so
19:59 - your full name is demo test so it is
20:01 - concatenating the first name and the
20:04 - last name your age is this as we typed
20:07 - in and your country is India so this is
20:10 - how you can use this intermediates to
20:16 - print out things into the console or you
20:20 - can even use it in the Tait database
20:22 - right and yep so this is the output I
20:33 - shown over here and this is how you can
20:39 - use an image into a kinto window
20:42 - this is method and subnets it for this
20:47 - video guys and the second video will be
20:51 - learning more about different widgets
20:53 - like checkbox and radio buttons so this
20:56 - is output for this video and thanks for
21:00 - watching
