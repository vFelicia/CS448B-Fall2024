00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:04 - laravel for beginners tutorial series so
00:08 - actually this is the part 5 of this
00:10 - tutorial series and in this video we're
00:13 - going to talk about blade templates and
00:16 - of course a sort of recap from the
00:19 - previous video we work with the
00:22 - controllers and we set up controllers by
00:24 - using the artisan and as I've said in
00:27 - this video we're going to talk about
00:29 - blade templates so let's go ahead and
00:31 - create a new folder inside our resources
00:35 - folder and under views so we're going to
00:38 - create here a layout directory so new
00:45 - folder and then we're just going to name
00:48 - it layouts because as you can see if we
00:53 - try to open up our pages the about the
00:56 - index and the services you can see we
00:59 - have repeating HTML for our services
01:03 - page our index page and our about page
01:07 - so we'll try to minimize that by using
01:10 - our layout files so under layouts this
01:17 - is under view so under layout we will
01:19 - create a new file called up that laid
01:23 - that PHP and then we're going to
01:26 - substitute or we're going to add some
01:29 - keywords here that will enable us to
01:32 - minimize this repeating HTML and inside
01:37 - here we're just going to copy the HTML
01:40 - from our about V dot PHP and paste it
01:44 - here in our app that laid dot PHP and in
01:49 - here we'll just say add symbol and then
01:53 - yield and and then keyword content so
02:01 - save this and inside our index dot PHP
02:07 - so instead of using all this HTML we'll
02:11 - just delete this and
02:13 - we'll just leave this h1 and paragraph
02:16 - tag and at the top we'll just say
02:20 - extends and then open in close single
02:25 - quote and then layouts that up so the
02:31 - reason behind we we put layout set up
02:34 - because this particularly out belongs or
02:39 - under layouts folder and the name of the
02:42 - layout is app so that's why we extend
02:46 - layout that up here and of course let's
02:51 - just delete this also the body and the
02:53 - HTML tag and in here was just gonna put
02:56 - a section and it should be the content
03:03 - right there and in here let's we'll just
03:09 - end the section okay there you go
03:14 - let us save this and copy all this code
03:18 - or maybe here and then go tour about
03:22 - that page P so instead of using all this
03:25 - HTML we'll just replace that and put the
03:29 - end section there same thing with our
03:33 - services so remove all that HTML and
03:38 - type in the end section here so let's go
03:44 - ahead and try to preview if all of our
03:48 - code are working so here we are at our
03:54 - index let's just refresh that and as you
03:57 - can see our index dot PHP file is still
04:00 - working with all the h1 and paragraph
04:05 - tag there and if we try to go to about
04:10 - it should work as well and of course the
04:13 - services okay so this is the index right
04:19 - so maybe we'll just change the stacks
04:22 - and try to see if
04:26 - it's working or if it's really working
04:29 - or not so let's go back to our code
04:32 - editor and index that blade that PHP so
04:37 - welcome to laravel for beginners and
04:41 - we'll just delete that save our file and
04:44 - let's go back to our browser mmm
04:47 - refresh there you go as you can see the
04:51 - h1 tag only contains now D welcome to
04:54 - laravel for beginners tax so in that
04:57 - manner we won't have to repeat all the
05:00 - ugly HTML that we had before and now
05:04 - let's try if we want to pass some values
05:08 - or parameters to our blade templates so
05:11 - let's go to our pages controller in the
05:15 - app HTTP and then under controllers so
05:20 - pages controllers and let's try to pass
05:24 - some values or parameters to our layout
05:28 - by just using this mechanism here so
05:32 - let's just say title and then welcome to
05:39 - programming knowledge something like
05:42 - this programming knowledge there you go
05:46 - and actually there's two ways on how to
05:49 - do this but I will show you both ways on
05:52 - passing values to our template so the
05:58 - first way is this so let's just pass
06:02 - parameters so view and then compact
06:07 - compact there and pass in the title as
06:11 - the parameter and let's go to our index
06:14 - so instead of using this text here let's
06:17 - type in curly braces and then tighten
06:25 - there we go and let's try to save this
06:27 - and go back to our browser so this is
06:31 - the original text welcome to larval for
06:34 - beginners and let's refresh our page
06:39 - so I think we have an error use of
06:41 - undefined constant title assume so I
06:43 - think we forgot to type in the dollar
06:46 - sign or money sign so instead of only
06:50 - the title we'll type in the dollar sign
06:52 - for our placeholder and then save that
06:57 - and refresh there you go as you can see
07:01 - welcome to programming knowledge so
07:05 - let's just just to make sure let's just
07:10 - change something here in our text so
07:14 - instead of the title let's just say
07:19 - welcome to programming knowledge and
07:21 - then let's try to add a mark there or at
07:26 - the exclamation mark and refresh our
07:28 - page and there you can see welcome to
07:31 - programming knowledge with the
07:33 - exclamation mark another way of passing
07:36 - parameters to our layout is by using the
07:40 - keyword width so instead of using this
07:43 - let's just comment this out and paste it
07:45 - here and also change this instead of
07:50 - compact let's just say width and of
07:54 - course the title keyword and the actual
07:58 - variable title let's just go ahead and
08:03 - do the same thing for our about pages so
08:06 - in here we can pass in the about us tax
08:13 - and this should be with and of course
08:18 - title with the actual variable title
08:22 - here and also in this particular method
08:25 - we can pass in multiple data by using
08:29 - array and instead of using the title
08:33 - variable so let's just say data and then
08:37 - we will define an array here array and
08:42 - inside this array let's just say we have
08:46 - a title here
08:48 - and then services okay
08:53 - and of course we need to pass this to
08:56 - our services page or services layout
09:00 - with the keyword with let's just not
09:04 - forget the greater than sign in of
09:07 - course you can use the theta volleyball
09:12 - and let's just go to our pages be about
09:18 - so instead of using the about here let's
09:24 - just go ahead and type in the title and
09:28 - also for our services here we can just
09:33 - say title
09:38 - there you go so about and our services
09:42 - and including our index that made that
09:44 - made that PHP and let's try to refresh
09:48 - our page
09:49 - and let's go to our about page as you
09:53 - can see we have here that dated about
09:55 - page and also the services with I think
10:00 - we have misspelled a bit so let's try to
10:03 - change that in our code editor so
10:06 - services I think it's in our pages
10:10 - controller and of course by deleting the
10:15 - D because we have misspelled there and
10:18 - refresh and there you have it
10:21 - services this is the service page so I
10:24 - think that's it for this tutorial and in
10:27 - the next video we're going to discuss
10:28 - compiling assets and maybe models and
10:32 - database migrations so see you in the
10:35 - next video thanks
