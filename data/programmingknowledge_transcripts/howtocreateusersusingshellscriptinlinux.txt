00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:02 - we'll be automating the user creation
00:04 - okay
00:05 - so how we can do it let's uh start with
00:08 - the video and I will create the file
00:10 - that is 17 user creation dot sh okay
00:15 - just add the hash Bank
00:19 - okay so let me first tell you the use
00:21 - case okay what will the use case so here
00:23 - the use case will be the for Loop first
00:25 - we want multiple users and then username
00:29 - input
00:31 - then password
00:33 - and also choice whether user want to add
00:36 - user or not
00:38 - okay so I will comment out this and I
00:40 - will just create the for Loop first
00:42 - the loop will be I equal to 0 and I will
00:46 - just run this Loop till less than equal
00:48 - to 2. and I plus plus
00:52 - okay so here first I will take the input
00:55 - from the user so I will first use enter
00:59 - your choice okay if choice is one
01:02 - then we will add user otherwise you know
01:06 - read choice
01:08 - okay
01:09 - so we will read choice and we will apply
01:14 - the if condition here if
01:17 - so one space here if dollar choice
01:21 - hyphen EQ it means equal to 1
01:26 - then what we have to do then
01:28 - we have to take the username into read
01:31 - username
01:33 - so here I will do just
01:36 - eco
01:39 - enter the username
01:43 - okay and next I will take the input eco
01:49 - enter the password read
01:53 - password okay
01:55 - so uh now till now we have a uh like we
02:00 - will take the input from the user okay
02:02 - so the command that we use to add the
02:05 - user that is the user that then we will
02:07 - use sudo user add and we will provide
02:10 - hyphen name hyphen s slash bin Bash
02:14 - okay and the username
02:17 - so username is this one and this we have
02:20 - stored a username
02:22 - and then we will pass the password
02:24 - because the password takes the two
02:26 - parameters okay so I will pass like this
02:28 - okay so
02:30 - dollar
02:32 - username
02:35 - dollar password
02:38 - and the pipe is pipeworks because it
02:42 - passes the uh whatever the uh foreign
02:54 - so we will write CH password
02:57 - okay so this command will add the
03:00 - password in the uh system okay or for
03:04 - that user you can say so now the else
03:06 - part will be
03:08 - else just break out of the loop and
03:11 - close the
03:13 - if condition okay I will just
03:18 - clear and I will just
03:20 - add the permission
03:24 - dot slash 17 enter your choice my choice
03:27 - is one enter username I will enter like
03:31 - hello world
03:33 - password Linux machine
03:36 - okay so here you can see uh
03:38 - Authentication
03:40 - we are getting some kind of error like
03:42 - user hello world
03:46 - okay
03:49 - password node change into your choice
03:51 - let me just enter some other number to
03:53 - break out of the loop okay let me check
03:56 - with the code again
04:01 - so read twice we are getting the choice
04:03 - enter the username that is the read
04:05 - username then read password
04:07 - then sudo user add hyphen name hyphen as
04:10 - pin bash and we have passed the username
04:12 - here okay
04:13 - then Eco username and here you can see
04:17 - the password okay we have
04:20 - okay there was a mini mistake so again
04:24 - let me just run the command uh so
04:27 - but before that let me just delete that
04:29 - user Dell user hello world I think it
04:31 - was
04:33 - okay done
04:35 - so again just run the script and enter
04:38 - your choice my choice is one and uh
04:40 - username Ankit I will write and password
04:43 - I will write
04:45 - um
04:46 - hello world
04:48 - okay so now it is asking me to again
04:52 - enter my choice whether I want to add a
04:54 - user or not so I will know I don't want
04:56 - so I will write 0 so we are out of the
04:58 - loop now I will login into the Ankit
05:02 - and enter the password hello world
05:06 - so here you can see who am I if I will
05:08 - do so it is Ankit okay so in this way uh
05:13 - we can
05:16 - uh like automate the user creation if
05:18 - you want to and multiple users suppose
05:20 - if you want to add only one user at a
05:22 - time then you can use this commands Okay
05:25 - these much of a script and you don't
05:27 - need any if condition and all those
05:29 - things okay
05:30 - so in this way you can automate the user
05:32 - creation I hope you liked it and if you
05:34 - have any queries then please you can ask
