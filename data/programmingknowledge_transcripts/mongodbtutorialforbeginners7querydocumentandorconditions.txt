00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - mongodb database tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in the last video we have seen how we
00:06 - can query our documents in mongod DB on
00:10 - the basis of uh some conditions for
00:12 - example greater than or uh less than or
00:15 - equal to or not equal to or how we can
00:19 - find the first element which was
00:21 - inserted into the database right now in
00:25 - this video we will see how we can query
00:27 - the documents on the basis of and or or
00:32 - condition okay so let's get started for
00:35 - example I will use the same example as
00:39 - in the last video we have the St School
00:42 - uh database in which we have the
00:44 - collection called students and we have
00:47 - some documents inside this collection
00:50 - right now for example we want to uh you
00:53 - know query a document or we want to
00:57 - fetch the data whose uh you know student
01:00 - name is for example first name is Mark
01:04 - and age is uh 10 so this is and
01:08 - condition two condition which are added
01:11 - together using and uh operator right so
01:15 - we can just write
01:17 - db. student doind as we always do to
01:23 - query the database and then inside these
01:26 - uh round brackets just give these curly
01:29 - Braes and as the last time we just need
01:34 - to give the same uh condition for
01:36 - example first name is equal to Mark
01:38 - which is this one and when you separate
01:42 - this condition by comma it means uh you
01:45 - are using and operator right so first
01:48 - name should be Mark and age should be
01:51 - for example 10 okay this means we want
01:55 - to uh you know fetch the student whose
01:58 - first name is Mark and his name or his
02:03 - age is 10 here okay so let's execute
02:08 - this and it gives the first result so
02:13 - this is how and operator Works in uh
02:17 - mongodb now let's see how we can use R
02:20 - operator in uh querying our document so
02:24 - for example we want to query a document
02:27 - for students whose first name is Mark or
02:31 - the age is 15 so how we can do it so we
02:35 - can once again write DB dot students do
02:41 - find and in these round brackets first
02:44 - of all add a curly brace like this and
02:49 - inside this curly brace for uh using our
02:53 - operator we use a dollar symbol and then
02:56 - write R which says we want to use or
02:59 - operator
03:00 - and then give a colon and then give a
03:03 - square bracket here so just it's like a
03:06 - array we want to query and then inside
03:09 - this uh square bracket we have the
03:13 - number of uh condition for example this
03:17 - curly braces and once again curly braces
03:20 - and then this curly braces uh comes your
03:23 - condition and you can use and as many uh
03:26 - you know condition as you want not even
03:28 - two but multiple right so our first
03:31 - condition is the first name should be a
03:35 - mark and the age should
03:38 - be 15 okay so what this means we want to
03:43 - query a
03:44 - database of students whose first name is
03:48 - Mark or we are using or operator here or
03:52 - the age is 15 okay so let's execute this
03:57 - query and you can see uh uh we have two
04:00 - result first is satisfying our first
04:03 - condition which is this one and second
04:06 - is uh satisfying the second condition
04:09 - which is age should be 15 for example
04:13 - let's say it should be 16 we have two
04:15 - student whose age is 16 and let's
04:19 - execute
04:20 - this and you can see we have uh this
04:24 - data okay now let's see how we can mix
04:27 - uh and and or operator for qu ing the
04:30 - document so let's copy this command
04:34 - again and paste it here and for example
04:38 - first of all we want to uh you know
04:41 - query uh data whose first name is Mark
04:45 - once again so we can uh just give this
04:49 - query
04:51 - first like this and then just write
04:55 - comma and then just give a dollar or as
05:00 - we have done here and then colon and
05:03 - then your other conditions something
05:05 - like this okay so for example you want
05:08 - uh the data whose uh first name is Mark
05:13 - or the age should be for example 15 or
05:19 - the age should be 16 so this condition
05:24 - and this condition is separated by and
05:27 - and these two conditions are are
05:29 - separated by R okay so once again
05:32 - execute the command and it gives us
05:35 - nothing because there is no student in
05:39 - our database whose name is Mark as well
05:43 - as whose age is 15 or 16 okay so let's
05:48 - uh change the condition for example we
05:50 - want to uh have the data of student
05:53 - whose uh age is 10 or 16 or and the name
05:57 - is Mark okay and once again execute it
06:01 - and we have one data like this okay so
06:05 - in this way you can use end and or
06:08 - operator for quiring your documents I
