00:00 - Club is now in this particular video we
00:01 - are going to learn about the IP Command
00:03 - okay so this is similar to the ipconfig
00:06 - ifconfig command okay so in this
00:09 - particular video we are going to learn
00:10 - about this so let me open up the
00:12 - terminal and
00:14 - let me just increase the font size okay
00:16 - I hope it is visible to you
00:19 - and the command is just IP and you have
00:21 - to provide just one option that is a or
00:23 - a this one double TR okay so this will
00:27 - give you the IP addresses of for each
00:30 - interface so that is this is the local
00:31 - host and second one is my this one
00:34 - interface a and P0 S3 and my Mac address
00:37 - is there which is provided by the
00:40 - which what we say virtual box and this
00:44 - one is the IP address okay
00:46 - so uh
00:48 - now moving forward uh if you want to get
00:50 - the on the ipv4 address so what can you
00:53 - type okay so IP iPhone 4
00:58 - and just awdr and here you go and now
01:03 - you have got the only ipv4 addresses not
01:06 - IPv6 but what if you want to get the ipv
01:09 - IPv6 address then what command you can
01:12 - do I B iPhone 6.
01:15 - address okay so here you can see this is
01:18 - the
01:19 - IPv6 I just it means IP version 6
01:23 - address okay so basically there are the
01:25 - two types of addresses that is the IP
01:27 - version 4 and version 6 and there are
01:29 - some differences between them uh like um
01:32 - uh differences in you can say on basis
01:37 - of bit size okay you can learn more
01:39 - about the differences between ipv4 and
01:41 - IPv6
01:42 - and moving forward uh let me tell you
01:46 - about one more uh this option that is a
01:50 - IP address so Dev and interface if you
01:54 - want to get only information about some
01:56 - particular input interface so I will go

02:03 - and here you can see the only result
02:06 - from this interface particular e and p 0
02:09 - S3 let me clear the screen so that it
02:13 - will be
02:14 - more visible to you let me again run the
02:17 - command okay here you can see the
02:19 - interface is this one
02:21 - and here is the MAC address and the IP
02:25 - address okay so in this way you can get
02:27 - the IP address and Mac address of your
02:30 - system using this IP Command okay if you
02:33 - want to learn more you can just do man

02:38 - options as you can see here hyphen H for
02:41 - human readable for hypheness for stats
02:44 - so so I'll put more information if the
02:46 - cap option appears twice another amount
02:48 - of information increases okay
02:51 - so let me try hyphen as IP hyphen is
02:55 - let's see what happens okay
