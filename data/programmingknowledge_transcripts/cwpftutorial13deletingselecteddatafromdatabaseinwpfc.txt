00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:03 - last video I have shown you how to edit
00:05 - your data in the database which is your
00:08 - esite database using wpfc shop
00:13 - application in this video I will show
00:15 - you how to delete your data in the
00:17 - escolite database using your WPF cop
00:20 - application so for that I will need a
00:25 - button this is not a button so I we'll
00:30 - drag and drop a button once
00:34 - again this
00:36 - one and I will just change the name of
00:42 - this button so
00:49 - BTN button delete and I will change the
00:53 - content of this button also so I will
00:56 - write
00:58 - delete uh and
01:01 - now I will double click this button here
01:04 - and we will reach to the button delete
01:07 - cck
01:08 - event so just go to your form once again
01:13 - and in the last video I've shown you how
01:15 - to update your data with the button
01:19 - click so I just double click that and I
01:22 - will copy all the P all the code from
01:25 - there you can copy the code from the
01:29 - save button click event also which I
01:33 - have shown you in the previous to
01:36 - previous video so any code either update
01:39 - code or the save button click event code
01:44 - you just copy it and paste it into this
01:48 - delete button click event so this is the
01:51 - code if you don't want know what this
01:53 - code was you can pause this video and
01:57 - copy
01:58 - this and I I'm just changing the query
02:03 - from here for deleting the data from the
02:07 - database so I will keep this code as it
02:11 - is instead of this query so I deleted
02:14 - the query and I will write the new query
02:18 - here double codes and then I will close
02:21 - and in between these codes I will write
02:23 - the query for
02:24 - deleting so for deleting data from the
02:27 - database I write
02:30 - this
02:37 - delete from your table name so my table
02:41 - name here is employee info
02:45 - table so whatever from whatever table
02:49 - you want to delete your data write
02:50 - delete from table
02:54 - name
02:58 - where
03:00 - where on what basis you want to delete
03:03 - your data so for example I have in the
03:06 - in my database employee ID name surname
03:09 - and age I can choose any one of the
03:12 - field for example I want to delete the
03:15 - data on the basis of my employee ID so I
03:19 - will
03:20 - write here delete from employee input
03:24 - the table name where my Eid which this
03:28 - is the column name
03:31 - and is equal to double Cotes inside
03:37 - this no this is a single code then
03:40 - double code and then Plus+ sign okay and
03:44 - in here I will write
03:47 - this
03:49 - dot Eid text which is the text box name
03:52 - of my Eid
03:55 - dot
03:57 - text okay this is the name of my text
04:01 - box so I have written delete from
04:04 - employee info where my employee ID is
04:07 - this so whatever I enter in this Eid
04:10 - text box here it will delete the
04:14 - employee ID or delete the data of that
04:17 - employee
04:18 - ID
04:20 - so this is this is the
04:23 - code nothing much in it you can just
04:26 - copy
04:28 - and paste the code from here so just
04:33 - pause the video and copy the code I just
04:36 - need to change this message also so I
04:39 - will I will
04:42 - write deleted
04:44 - here okay and this is your code now we
04:48 - will check whether our code works or not
04:51 - so I will run the
04:55 - code and username and ID which is is
04:59 - correct or username and password and
05:03 - let's open our
05:07 - database so this is my database this is
05:11 - my table employee info and I have
05:14 - employee ID name surname age username
05:17 - and password so for example I want to
05:21 - delete the data of employee ID 6 this
05:25 - one so I will write here six in the
05:29 - employee ID text
05:31 - box and I don't need to fill any other
05:34 - field because I'm deleting on the basis
05:37 - of my employee ID and I click this
05:41 - delete button and it shows me deleted
05:45 - that is my data is deleted but in here
05:48 - you will see the change when you refresh
05:52 - this database so how can you refresh
05:54 - this database just switch the tab and
05:59 - come here and you see employee ID 6 is
06:03 - gone okay so in this way you can delete
06:08 - your uh data with the help of your WPF
06:12 - application in your escal database so I
