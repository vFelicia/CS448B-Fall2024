03:01 - for the first time it's going to show
03:04 - you this kind of anaconda Navigator and
03:08 - if uh this Anaconda recognizes that you
03:12 - have some older version of Anaconda it's
03:14 - going to uh encourage you to update your

03:46 - will click on continue and then I'm
03:48 - going to click on close which is going
03:50 - to uh finish the installation of
03:53 - anaconda so we don't need this PKG uh
03:56 - installer anymore so we can click on

04:00 - the installer to the bin now you can see
04:03 - this Anaconda Navigator is launched here
04:06 - you have all these different uh tools
04:10 - which you can use some will have the

04:15 - means that these are the applications
04:17 - which you can launch and these uh
04:20 - applications comes pre packaged with the
04:23 - Anaconda distribution for example
04:26 - applications like notebook and spider
04:29 - are very popular among developers which
04:32 - can be used with the cond application
04:35 - right I also have uh the visual studio
04:39 - code and py charm Community already
04:41 - pre-installed so I can also see the
04:43 - launch button for those and then some
04:47 - applications you can install later for
04:50 - example Anaconda toolbox uh clue visz
04:53 - Orange 3 and py Chom professional so
04:57 - these are some applications you can uh
04:59 - install at the later Point let me close
05:02 - this Anaconda navigator for now and then
05:05 - click on yes to uh exit out of it once
05:08 - the Anaconda uh distribution is
05:11 - installed you will be able to see this
05:13 - Anaconda icon in the Launchpad you can
05:16 - also search for the Anaconda icon and
05:19 - then uh open it from the Launchpad
05:23 - itself and generally uh people do this
05:26 - so every time if any update is available
05:30 - it's going to encourage you to update to
05:31 - the latest version now as I mentioned
05:34 - jupyter notebook and spider are very
05:36 - popular when you uh install Anaconda
05:39 - Navigator so from here you can click on
05:41 - launch which is going to launch the
05:44 - Jupiter Notebook on your default browser
05:48 - so when you click on the jupyter
05:49 - notebook launch button it's going to
05:51 - launch uh this Jupiter interface on your
05:55 - default browser you can see it will look
05:58 - like this you will also see that uh here
06:02 - the terminal will open and uh it's going
06:05 - to show you the process uh which has
06:09 - launched the Jupiter notebook right so
06:12 - if you want to uh know the token you can
06:15 - see this is the token which uh will be
06:18 - used to log to your notebook and this is
06:23 - the URL so some information about your
06:28 - notebook will be displayed here which
06:30 - you can use uh later right now in order
06:34 - to create a new notebook you can select
06:36 - any folder for example I'm going to
06:37 - select the documents folder here and
06:40 - let's say I want to create a script
06:42 - inside uh the sample folder I'm going to
06:45 - navigate there and then I can click on
06:47 - new and then click on Python 3 for
06:51 - example and it's going to open this uh
06:55 - kind of Jupiter interface here I can
06:59 - eval EV valuate some script for example
07:01 - if I write 2 + 2 here then click on the
07:03 - Run button it's going to evaluate that
07:05 - script and then it's going to show you
07:08 - the output for example I want to write
07:11 - uh print and then I want to print
07:15 - something for example hello world I can
07:17 - do that and then I can click on the Run
07:20 - button which is going to print the
07:22 - output so this is how you can uh launch
07:25 - your jupyter notebook and use
07:28 - it also when I move back to the Anaconda
07:33 - Navigator I can also launch this uh
07:37 - Spider IDE so I'm going to click on
07:40 - spider IDE which is going to launch this
07:42 - IDE on my uh Mac operating system so you
07:47 - can see this IDE has been launched and
07:49 - it says Anaconda Navigator would like to
07:51 - access the file system on your desktop
07:54 - I'm going to click on okay here and then
07:56 - click on okay here and then then click
07:59 - on okay so it's going to ask you uh the
08:03 - permission and then you can take a tool
08:06 - uh how spider IDE works so click on
08:10 - start tool and if you don't want that
08:13 - click on dismiss here so here in the
08:16 - spider IDE also you can uh run your
08:19 - python script example let's say I want
08:22 - to just uh print hello world so I'm
08:24 - going to just uh type that once I'm done
08:28 - I can run this by clicking on this run
08:32 - button and then you have uh this run
08:35 - configuration run file with default
08:37 - configuration and then if you want to
08:40 - give the custom configuration you can
08:42 - choose this configuration from here I'm
08:44 - going to run the file with default
08:47 - configuration and then click on run and
08:49 - it's going to print the output here and
08:51 - then I have the option to run the
08:53 - current cell and go to the next one and
08:56 - then I have the option to uh run the
08:59 - selected area or current line from here
09:03 - I have these debug buttons at the top so
09:05 - when I want to start the debugging uh if
09:08 - I just add these break points here and
09:11 - then start the debugging my debugger is
09:13 - going to stop uh at these break points
09:15 - and then I will be able to debug my uh
09:18 - code which I have written in Python now
09:22 - Anaconda also comes with the cond
09:24 - package manager so when you uh open a
09:27 - new terminal you can open the new
09:29 - terminal by clicking on the spotlight
09:31 - option and then just search for the
09:33 - terminal and open the new terminal from
09:35 - here and let me open the new terminal
09:38 - window here and then you can use this
09:41 - cond command here to uh install some
09:45 - packages right so to list out the list
09:48 - of packages you can give this command
09:50 - cond list and then press enter and it's
09:53 - going to show you uh the list of
09:54 - packages which are available you can see
09:56 - so many packages here so so uh you can
10:00 - install all these packages using cond so
10:04 - so to install a package using cond you
10:06 - just needed to uh run this command
10:09 - install and the name of the package you
10:12 - can uh see uh any package name which is
10:15 - available here and then click on uh that
10:18 - package for example pqt and then cond
10:22 - install pqt and then press enter and
10:24 - it's going to install that cond package
10:27 - but I will recommend you to create
10:29 - the virtual EnV first and then install
10:32 - these packages so that they are not
10:34 - globally installed but they are
10:36 - installed in your project
10:38 - only so that's how you can download and
10:41 - install anaconda on your Mac operating
10:44 - system I hope you've enjoyed this video
10:46 - and I will see you in the next video
