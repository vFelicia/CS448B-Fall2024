00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - docker tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we are going to see how we can
00:07 - download and install docker
00:08 - on our Ubuntu operating system so let's
00:12 - get started so what I'm going to do is
00:15 - I'm going to open my favorite browser
00:18 - and then I'm going to search here docker
00:21 - install Ubuntu and the first link which
00:25 - will appear here will be from docs dot
00:28 - docx or com I'm going to put the link in
00:32 - the description also so I'm going to
00:34 - click this link which is the official
00:37 - documentation of installing docker
00:40 - engine Community Edition on your Ubuntu
00:43 - operating system so here you can see the
00:47 - prerequisite of installing docker on
00:51 - your Reuben to operating system so you
00:53 - can see the OS requirements and right
00:56 - now I have this version which is 18.04
00:59 - LTS version and if you have the older
01:04 - version of docker or docker IO or docker
01:07 - engine installed you can use this
01:10 - command to uninstall previous versions
01:13 - of docker now to install docker
01:17 - you can just scroll a little bit down
01:20 - and they have the very good
01:22 - documentation of installing docker on
01:25 - your Rubin to operating system so we are
01:28 - going to just copy these commands and
01:30 - paste it on our terminal and we'll be
01:33 - will be good to go so the first command
01:35 - is sudo apt-get update so I'm going to
01:38 - just copy this come on and I'm going to
01:40 - just open my terminal here and then just
01:44 - paste this command and then give my open
01:47 - to spaz word and then just press Enter
01:50 - is going to update all the repositories
01:54 - and then I'm going to just copy the
01:59 - second command in a meanwhile so this is
02:02 - the second command and in the second
02:04 - command we install the packages to allow
02:07 - the apt to use the repository over HTTP
02:11 - so let's just copy
02:13 - this command and go to our terminal and
02:16 - then let me just clear the terminal and
02:19 - now I'm going to just paste this command
02:22 - and then press Enter which is going to
02:25 - start the installation I'm going to
02:28 - press Y and then press Enter and in the
02:32 - meantime we are going to copy the third
02:35 - command which is to add Dockers official
02:37 - GPG key so for that you need to have
02:41 - curl and curl we are installing using
02:45 - this second command so when the second
02:49 - command is finished you will have curl
02:51 - on your system and then we can just give
02:55 - the third command so hopefully that is
02:59 - complete so let's clear the terminal
03:01 - once again and then paste the third
03:06 - command and it's okay so we will move to
03:11 - the next command which is to verify that
03:14 - you now have the key with the
03:17 - fingerprints so I'm going to just copy
03:19 - this and then paste it here and verify
03:24 - this and you will see the similar result
03:27 - which is also shown here when you give
03:30 - this command so now we will move to the
03:34 - next command which is to install the
03:36 - docker repository so for Ubuntu you need
03:40 - the first option here which is x86 64 so
03:44 - I'm going to just copy this command once
03:47 - again and then go to the terminal
03:50 - clear this terminal and then paste this
03:54 - command and then press ENTER which is
03:57 - going to install the docker repository
03:59 - and then in the next step we are going
04:02 - to update the repositories once again
04:06 - before installing docker so here you can
04:09 - see the next command which is to update
04:12 - the repositories again and then we are
04:15 - going to just install the docker so
04:19 - after update we are going to install the
04:22 - latest version of docker engine which is
04:25 - the community version
04:27 - so for that we just need to give this
04:29 - command which is going to install docker
04:32 - c e and docker CEC Li and container dot
04:38 - IO so I'm going to just copy this last
04:41 - command and then paste it to the
04:43 - terminal so clear the terminal just
04:46 - paste this command and then just wait
04:49 - for the installation to complete so it's
04:51 - that easy to install docker Community
04:55 - Edition on your Ubuntu operating system
04:58 - and if you want to install a specific
05:02 - version of these packages you can give
05:07 - these command so when you give this
05:09 - command apt cache medicine docker - seee
05:13 - you will see a different version of
05:16 - docker which are available for your open
05:19 - to operating system so from here you
05:22 - just need to take the version and then
05:24 - replace this placeholder for the version
05:27 - string with the actual version of
05:30 - whatever tool you want install so for
05:33 - example if you want to install the
05:36 - version of docker seee for example we
05:40 - need the latest version of the docker
05:43 - seee then you can just copy this and
05:45 - then just replace this placeholder
05:49 - string by this string okay same you can
05:54 - do for the docker seee CLI so once this
05:58 - command is finished I am going to once
06:00 - again clear the terminal and we are
06:02 - going to run this command which is sudo
06:05 - docker run hello world in order to test
06:09 - whether everything is working fine or
06:11 - not and here I'm going to just write
06:12 - sudo docker run hello - world and then
06:21 - press ENTER and I'm going to give my
06:23 - open to password and you can see when
06:26 - you run this command it prints hello
06:28 - from docker so first of all what happens
06:31 - is because we are running this docker
06:34 - command for the first time it's going to
06:37 - find the docker locally and if it's not
06:39 - found
06:40 - then it's going to pull your docker
06:43 - image from the docker hub and then
06:46 - execute this hello world image which is
06:50 - going to print this kind of output so if
06:53 - you see this kind of outward that means
06:55 - docker is running on your system and
06:57 - also you can check the docker images now
07:02 - so you can just give this command sudo
07:06 - docker which is going to list out all
07:10 - the docker images you have on your
07:12 - Ubuntu operating system so that's how
07:15 - you can install docker on your Ubuntu
07:19 - operating system I hope you've enjoyed
07:21 - this video and I will see you in the
07:23 - next video
