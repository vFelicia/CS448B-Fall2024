00:00 - otherwise now in this particular video
00:01 - we are going to learn about the SCP
00:03 - command okay so basically this command
00:04 - is used to copy the files from one host
00:06 - to the another host that is a in our
00:09 - previous video we had created the
00:11 - virtual machine and
00:13 - today we will work on that particular
00:15 - thing
00:16 - so basically in this video we will
00:18 - create one virtual machine and we will
00:19 - share the file or move file from this
00:22 - machine from this Ubuntu machine to that
00:25 - particular remote machine okay so we
00:27 - will do this with the SCP command so
00:31 - let's start the video on first of all we
00:32 - will need to create a virtual machine
00:35 - so on this particular URL you can go
00:38 - like learn microsoft.com and uh intro to
00:41 - Azure virtual machine then you here you
00:43 - will get the sandbox and you will get
00:45 - the access of one hour of azure portal
00:48 - so you don't need to pay any amount of
00:50 - money for creating virtual machine or
00:52 - anything okay
00:54 - so we will wait for some time uh it will
00:57 - just take hardly 10 seconds now
01:02 - okay let's wait
01:07 - 92 93 4
01:11 - okay hundred okay so here you can see 59
01:14 - minutes so it's basically we get taxes
01:16 - for one hour so now come down
01:18 - and just click on this as your portal
01:23 - now here you will get the interface and
01:25 - maybe uh you will need to sign in with
01:28 - your Microsoft account and only then you
01:30 - will get the access
01:34 - okay it's taking some time let's wait
01:36 - okay here we go now here you will see
01:39 - the virtual machine you have to just
01:40 - click on it virtual machine
01:44 - and you will need to just go on Create
01:47 - and click on this as your virtual
01:48 - machine
01:54 - sometimes yeah
01:56 - here you have to just select your
01:58 - resource Group
02:01 - and virtual machine name I will just
02:05 - use this name Linux VM and the username
02:08 - and password
02:09 - so I will write the username as I use
02:12 - and the password I will write
02:19 - sorry
02:25 - okay again enter the password
02:31 - okay password match so here SSS 2022
02:34 - Port is allowed so basically sap command
02:36 - runs on this particular Port by default
02:39 - okay so uh next you will do but here you
02:44 - don't have to change any kind of
02:45 - settings and all
02:47 - it will be by default it will be same
02:50 - okay we don't need to change anything
02:54 - okay here we go now what do you have to
02:57 - you have to just click on review press
02:58 - create it will take approx one minute of
03:01 - time
03:05 - uh okay
03:07 - till now I pause the video
03:12 - okay guys so here you can see the
03:14 - validation is passed so now we have to
03:17 - just click on this create button
03:20 - so it will just create a virtual machine
03:22 - and we will get the public IP address of
03:25 - that particular machine and we will use
03:27 - that particular IPS address to connect
03:29 - with this machine and whatever the
03:32 - username and password we have provided
03:33 - while creating this virtual machine we
03:35 - will uh use that one to connect to this
03:38 - particular remote host
03:41 - so let's wait for some time it will just
03:43 - hardly take uh two to three minutes of
03:44 - time
03:46 - okay so Diplomat is in progress let's
03:48 - wait
03:53 - okay so till now uh till then I just uh
03:56 - give you the overview of what is the sap
03:58 - command so already I have told you like
04:01 - this command is used to like
04:04 - copy the file from one host to remote
04:07 - host
04:09 - so here basically this machine is my uh
04:11 - physical host physical machine you can
04:14 - say and the Machine to which I will
04:16 - connect like this virtual machine that
04:18 - will be my remote host so I will use
04:21 - this command to share file from this
04:23 - machine
04:24 - to another machine so there are also
04:27 - some many of options we use for fast
04:30 - transfer for getting information while
04:33 - transferring we will use all those
04:35 - particular functions
04:37 - so here you can see the deployment is
04:39 - complete now we have to just click on go
04:41 - to Resource and we we will get the
04:43 - particular public IP address
04:46 - and here it will show yeah here
04:50 - is the public IP address first of all
04:52 - what I will do I will just uh try to
04:54 - connect to that particular machine using
04:56 - the credential which we had provided in
04:58 - Mobile creation
05:00 - I hope the terminally visible to you
05:03 - just to SSH and whatever the username I
05:06 - use and the IP address
05:08 - okay so you have used to write yes it
05:12 - will uh
05:16 - permission denied publicly okay I don't
05:18 - know let me just close the terminal and
05:20 - again I will open up
05:24 - SSH I use
05:28 - at the rate IP address
05:32 - okay password it's asking me for
05:35 - password
05:39 - hit enter okay now I hope I have entered
05:42 - correct address uh correct password okay
05:45 - okay so now here you can see the uh
05:47 - whatever the host name we had added like
05:49 - Linux VM and I usually the username okay
05:51 - so if I will do uh clear the screen and
05:54 - I will write who am I
05:56 - so here you can see the uh
05:59 - username is ayush and uh also you can
06:02 - see this hostname has been changed from
06:03 - Linux VM
06:05 - uh from I used to link stream I think
06:07 - let me again open up one terminal and
06:09 - here you can see I use virtualbox is
06:11 - there okay so this one is my
06:15 - remote machine I just add one command
06:18 - here
06:20 - remote
06:22 - machine and I will just provide the IP
06:25 - address
06:26 - okay so this is the
06:29 - like command we use hash for writing the
06:31 - comment in this Linux terminal now
06:32 - moving forward another use of the sap
06:35 - command comes here if we have a file
06:38 - suppose I have to just create one file
06:39 - let me create one file with the name of
06:41 - cat test.txt
06:44 - and I will just not test I will write
06:47 - some another cat remote file Dot txt and
06:53 - I will write something like this file
06:56 - is being sent from
07:01 - ayush physical
07:03 - machine
07:05 - Ctrl D to save now we have to use the
07:09 - SCP command so basically SCP what it
07:11 - stands for it basically stands for
07:13 - secure copy so you will send the file
07:16 - using uh Port like 2022 it basically by
07:20 - default it uses Port 2022 and also about
07:23 - this machine accepts only port number 22
07:25 - no other port number it accepts the if
07:28 - request is coming from
07:29 - coming for the some other port number uh
07:32 - other than 2022 then in that case it
07:34 - will not reply back to that particular
07:38 - host okay
07:40 - so now what we have to do uh I will just
07:42 - let me do LS
07:45 - so here you can see the remote file dot
07:47 - text is there
07:49 - and let me just clear the screen and SCP
07:52 - I will use and I will use hyphen capital
07:55 - c for the faster transfer and the file
07:58 - name that is the remote file Dot txt and
08:01 - the username I will also need to provide
08:03 - here
08:04 - ayush and
08:07 - you share the rate and the control shift
08:10 - V and I will need to provide the
08:12 - location where we want to just
08:15 - what we say store that file so I will
08:19 - store this file at this particular
08:20 - location home ayush
08:22 - and 251 and I will just need to use this
08:27 - colon
08:28 - and
08:31 - sorry
08:34 - okay sorry sorry I just
08:38 - I will need to again write the command
08:43 - so here I have to just
08:46 - use slash omis okay so here what will
08:49 - happen basically uh this remote file.txt
08:51 - will get transferred from this must into
08:53 - this machine like copy will be
08:55 - transferred so let me just hit enter and
08:58 - it will ask me to enter the password
09:01 - and I will just enter the password
09:05 - okay done
09:08 - so here you can see hundred percent so
09:10 - 0.2 kb per second was the speed and uh
09:13 - let me clear the screen and I will do LS
09:15 - so here you can see the remote file.txt
09:17 - has been
09:18 - uh like copied into this particular
09:20 - remote host okay uh like let me uh just
09:26 - send another file also let me create
09:28 - ios.txt
09:37 - okay
09:38 - Ctrl D to save
09:39 - again I will use the same command just
09:41 - change the file name
09:45 - file name to ayush now hit enter again
09:48 - maybe hope it will
09:50 - ask me to enter the password but let's
09:53 - see yeah I will need to enter the
09:55 - password that is Kumar Walmart 38098
09:58 - hash
10:00 - hit enter and uh
10:02 - the file will get copied into that
10:04 - particular location
10:07 - okay it's taking time I don't know why
10:12 - okay now you are done so I will do again
10:16 - LS here
10:18 - so here you can see eyes dot txt has
10:19 - been copied now I will just
10:22 - try to read the content of this
10:24 - particular file
10:25 - Okay so
10:31 - I think the connection is slow that's
10:33 - why it's lagging
10:36 - okay sorry I've used wrong I have to
10:39 - read this
10:41 - okay okay
10:46 - let me just remove this
10:54 - okay yeah
10:57 - now just hit enter
11:00 - so basically it has overwritten with the
11:04 - like nothing we had written so by this
11:06 - command basically the text was
11:07 - overwritten
11:09 - no problem let me just read another file
11:11 - we have also transferred another file
11:13 - that is the remote file.txt
11:15 - we can read this
11:17 - okay so here you can see this file is
11:18 - being synchronized physical machine the
11:21 - same text which we had written in this
11:23 - particular physical machine
11:25 - okay so in this way we can transfer the
11:27 - files from one machine to another
11:28 - machine and also by default the CPU uses
11:31 - AES so 128 encryption method to encrypt
11:36 - files while while translate you can say
11:39 - but if you have to use some another
11:41 - method then you can use the iPhone C
11:44 - Small option also if you if you want to
11:47 - use some some different port number uh
11:50 - like if you will need to use then hyphen
11:52 - capital P option okay but by default
11:55 - this machine is accepting only the port
11:57 - number 2022 so if I will use some
12:00 - another port number then in that case it
12:02 - will not uh what we say
12:05 - it will not accept the request so if I
12:07 - will do hyphen Port 234 and I will just
12:11 - try to I will remove the files from this
12:14 - machine
12:16 - okay it's like running slow I don't know
12:19 - maybe it's
12:21 - reason behind is slow connection it may
12:23 - be
12:24 - so I'll just remove the iso.txt file
12:27 - here
12:27 - okay sorry
12:30 - you should take the area
12:33 - so now file has been removed and now I
12:35 - have used the hyphen p234 and I will use
12:38 - hyphen Capital C option and just hit
12:40 - enter so in this in this case you will
12:43 - get like it will not accept the request
12:47 - like
12:48 - it uh it will not display anything
12:50 - nothing will happen
12:52 - okay to solve this issue we will need to
12:56 - use just hyphen V option also hyphen
12:59 - small B that is just used for getting
13:02 - the
13:03 - default information
13:05 - okay
13:08 - hopefully we will get
13:12 - okay it's not connecting to the spot
13:14 - number
13:16 - yeah because port number is not open
13:17 - that port number is not open in this
13:19 - machine that's why
13:20 - so if I will use just sport number 2022
13:27 - and we have used the wrong command also
13:32 - hyphen P 2022 hyphen C Small hyphen V
13:37 - and now hit enter and here you got all
13:40 - the information
13:41 - so now you have to just enter the
13:43 - password but develop again ever we will
13:45 - see the information like connecting to
13:48 - this particular IP address on Port 2022
13:51 - enter the password
13:55 - so done
13:57 - next okay sending command sending file
14:00 - modes
14:01 - I store TX 300 15 compressed outgoing
14:04 - raw data this compressed to this so
14:07 - while Transit Transit what happens
14:08 - whatever the amount of whatever size of
14:11 - your file will get compressed and then
14:12 - again it will whenever we it will reach
14:14 - to the remote machine it will uh like
14:18 - stored in the original form
14:20 - so again if I do LS here
14:24 - so you will get the ios.txt file okay
14:27 - so uh now let's do with the different
14:31 - port number
14:32 - let's see what happens
14:33 - actually total port number in network we
14:36 - use our act prox
14:39 - 65535 for the total port numbers
14:42 - so I have just tailed it told about this
14:45 - for your information only
14:47 - so here you will see connecting to this
14:49 - particular IP and the port then you can
14:52 - see the port and after this nothing will
14:54 - happen because
14:56 - this machine is not
14:58 - accepting any port number
15:01 - other than Port 2022
15:04 - so it will not happen anything it will
15:06 - go in the infinite Loop you can say and
15:08 - bus like we just need to
15:11 - hit Ctrl C
15:14 - so basically in this way you can use the
15:16 - sap command to share files from one
15:17 - machine to another machine remotely or
15:20 - or also you can say like the two remote
15:23 - machines are there then and only then
15:24 - you can use this particular command so
15:27 - that's all for this today's video and I
15:28 - hope you liked it if you have any
15:30 - queries then you can ask us in the
15:31 - comment section so thank you thank you
15:33 - for watching and we'll meet in the next
15:34 - one thank you
