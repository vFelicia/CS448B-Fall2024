00:00 - the previous video we were able to
00:02 - display this image and the price per kg
00:05 - so in this video we are gonna make the
00:08 - rest of the ui and i have decided that
00:10 - i'll also make this ui and it will be
00:13 - static for now and once we make the
00:16 - apis for them we'll connect it with them
00:20 - so let's open our code editor i'll do a
00:23 - full restart
00:24 - to see if everything is working fine or
00:26 - not
00:32 - so we are getting the sellers now if i
00:34 - click on any seller
00:36 - their products are being shown
00:39 - okay i'll
00:41 - choose broccoli and then broccoli is
00:44 - being shown over here and it's
00:46 - price so this is in product details
00:49 - screen and i think i have not added the
00:52 - font over here
00:54 - so
00:55 - i'm gonna do that now
00:58 - the style
01:01 - is gonna be
01:02 - google style
01:06 - uh sorry google fonts
01:08 - dot pop pins
01:10 - okay i think
01:12 - this is enough so let me format it
01:19 - okay it is taking some time to download
01:22 - this poppins
01:23 - okay so once this is done i'll do a full
01:25 - restart and we have our font over here
01:28 - so let's continue now next thing is we
01:30 - have to add a description over here okay
01:33 - so
01:35 - this is the product image product price
01:38 - per kg this is the container
01:40 - over here we are gonna add the
01:44 - description
01:47 - so description is again gonna be a
01:50 - text field
01:51 - sorry it is gonna be a container
01:55 - okay
01:56 - and
01:57 - the container inside this will have our
02:00 - text field because of the issue we faced
02:02 - over here
02:03 - now again i wanted switch to be the
02:05 - entire screen width and the padding
02:08 - should be equal to the padding that we
02:09 - have given over here so that the entire
02:12 - text looks aligned so i'm gonna copy it
02:15 - paste it over here
02:18 - okay
02:18 - the error is because i'm missing a comma
02:20 - over here
02:22 - now inside this there is a text field
02:25 - okay sorry
02:26 - the child is a text field
02:30 - okay and the
02:32 - text is nothing but product dot and
02:35 - description
02:37 - okay
02:39 - let's see how it looks
02:42 - so we are getting a description over
02:44 - here but it doesn't look
02:46 - pretty
02:47 - so
02:48 - let us fix that
02:50 - what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna make the
02:52 - padding 40 so that we get little bit of
02:56 - extra space
02:59 - okay and i want to leave the same amount
03:01 - of padding from right side as well so
03:04 - either i can change add a right over
03:06 - here or change this only to symmetric
03:09 - i'm gonna change it to symmetric
03:12 - and this is gonna be the horizontal axis
03:16 - yeah
03:18 - let me save this
03:20 - okay this looks better
03:22 - now i also
03:24 - need to add a padding from the top but i
03:27 - am not sure if i need it from the bottom
03:30 - i am gonna add it from both sides for
03:32 - now
03:33 - but if
03:34 - later i don't need it i'll again switch
03:36 - back to only
03:39 - so i think 10 should do
03:41 - let's see
03:43 - yes it looks fine
03:45 - now let's come to our text
03:47 - style and the style is again gonna be
03:50 - text style
03:53 - sorry
03:54 - we don't want text style we want google
03:57 - fonts dot pop-ins
04:02 - okay
04:04 - now over here i'm gonna change the color
04:07 - okay the color is gonna be this color
04:17 - okay
04:21 - now let me add a comma let's format it
04:24 - let's see
04:25 - okay so it has converted to pop-ins but
04:27 - it is taking too much of space
04:30 - so what we can do is we can
04:33 - like remove some part of it for now
04:35 - like
04:36 - we can add our c-more option if we want
04:39 - for that we can use the rich text field
04:42 - but i am not gonna do that i am simply
04:44 - gonna
04:45 - clip certain part of the text
04:47 - okay but if you want to add the see more
04:49 - ncls option you can do that rich text is
04:53 - the
04:54 - way to do it dot
04:57 - i think it was a sub text or
05:01 - sub string yeah
05:03 - so i want from 0 to 120 let's see how
05:06 - much that is
05:09 - now it is way too less
05:11 - let's make it 150
05:13 - because actually over here the
05:16 - description wouldn't matter if you think
05:18 - from the product perspective
05:20 - the vegetable picture in itself
05:22 - tells everything
05:26 - okay 180 is giving us five lines let's
05:29 - see how much warren was in the design
05:32 - it was near around five
05:35 - lines so i think
05:36 - the text is done for now
05:41 - let me format it save it so we have our
05:44 - text in place
05:46 - now after text
05:48 - we have a
05:49 - review section
05:54 - product
05:55 - review
05:57 - okay so over here first we have a
06:00 - container
06:04 - okay that is understandable
06:07 - now this container
06:09 - will have our decoration
06:11 - the decoration is gonna be box
06:14 - decoration
06:15 - okay and generally in
06:18 - decoration we always have boxer
06:19 - decoration the color is gonna be gray
06:24 - color again i'll use the colors enum
06:26 - colors dot gray
06:29 - i'm sorry
06:31 - colors dot gray
06:33 - let's see how this looks
06:37 - okay where is the container i think
06:40 - i need to specify a height so i'm gonna
06:43 - give it a height of
06:45 - 50 for now
06:50 - so this is our container and this is not
06:53 - the gray we want so we can use different
06:56 - versions of it by just adding numbers
06:59 - into the square bracket
07:01 - so the numbers are like 100 200 300
07:03 - where 100 being the lightest shade and
07:06 - 800 or 900 being like and as you
07:10 - uh like increase the numbers the shades
07:12 - get darker that is the just
07:15 - so 200 is way too
07:18 - light i'm gonna make it four let's see
07:23 - now four is again too much
07:25 - let's make it three
07:27 - now let's check in our design i think
07:30 - three would do for now
07:32 - okay
07:33 - so
07:37 - let's give it a width
07:39 - or instead of giving it a width we can
07:42 - simply apply padding from both the sides
07:44 - or maybe margin margin is the way to go
07:46 - because padding will again the
07:48 - background color will be in the padded
07:50 - area as well so margin is the way to go
07:53 - margin
07:55 - const so now
07:56 - so i automatically put const over there
07:59 - because of
08:00 - because of the
08:02 - so many warnings that we got
08:04 - so now it has kind of become a habit
08:07 - so horizontal
08:09 - let's say 30.
08:14 - yeah so this looks fine
08:16 - um
08:17 - okay for now
08:20 - and the height can be 100
08:24 - see how much that is okay we can start
08:27 - with this for now we can again later
08:30 - change the height and margins if needed
08:33 - so now let's add border radius
08:39 - border radius dot circular
08:43 - i guess yes and 5.0
08:47 - okay let's see
08:51 - let's confirm it in our design
08:55 - i don't think it is 5 yes it is 15 so
09:01 - let's see
09:06 - yeah so the 15 here and 15 there is the
09:10 - same thing
09:13 - okay so now let's continue what i'm
09:15 - gonna do is i'm gonna take it to another
09:17 - screen
09:18 - so that i don't have to keep on
09:20 - flipping
09:22 - if you want to look the design the
09:24 - design link should be in the description
09:27 - okay
09:28 - so now after let's come back here
09:32 - now
09:33 - now that we have a container
09:36 - let's add the items that are inside it
09:39 - so along with this i am gonna add a
09:41 - padding over here so that the contents
09:44 - don't start appearing at the corner okay
09:47 - padding
09:50 - agent sets
09:52 - all
09:54 - 10.0
09:56 - let's see
09:58 - okay
09:59 - we will not see any visible change sorry
10:01 - for
