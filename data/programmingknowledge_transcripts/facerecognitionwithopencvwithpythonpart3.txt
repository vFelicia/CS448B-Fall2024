00:00 - so you guys welcome back to the new
00:01 - video and this is the third part of the
00:03 - series
00:04 - so in this video we're gonna see that
00:07 - like
00:07 - what i what is this function doing and
00:10 - what is the rest of the code doing okay
00:12 - so let me just explain
00:14 - that what actually this function is
00:15 - returning us and what type of
00:17 - coordinates are they
00:18 - okay so just let me open my notepad
00:24 - okay so this function like this function
00:27 - so let me just select a brush here
00:31 - okay okay so just function like space
00:34 - cascade dot
00:35 - detect multiscale which is uh this
00:38 - variable faces just means that this
00:41 - basis is a list and this list is storing
00:45 - the contents of the face
00:46 - so if i draw here like if i draw pieces
00:50 - like like if this is the person here
00:55 - like if this is person one like person
00:57 - one and if this is the person two
01:01 - okay so these both are faces okay
01:05 - so these are the top coordinates like x
01:08 - y
01:08 - are the top coordinates of the faces and
01:10 - this is the width
01:12 - this is the height okay so a box
01:16 - it returns like this detect multi scale
01:19 - returns a block to you like it returns a
01:22 - box
01:23 - in which we have the top left and
01:27 - we have the top left coordinates of x y
01:30 - and
01:30 - the height is h and the width
01:34 - is w okay so this function just returns
01:39 - x this function returns x
01:42 - y w and z so the w and h
01:47 - x y w and h okay so these are the
01:49 - coordinates and by this
01:51 - w and h we can just calculate it what
01:53 - are what can be these coordinates like
01:55 - this can be like x plus h and y plus w
01:59 - right like you can just calculate it by
02:03 - adding w
02:03 - and h in x and y so we can get this
02:06 - these and this coordinate also
02:08 - so this function is just returning as a
02:10 - coordinates so that
02:12 - we can just uh make a box into the field
02:16 - around the face okay that said about
02:19 - this
02:19 - let us move forward okay so now let us
02:22 - see that
02:23 - the further code so this line like faces
02:26 - is sorted faces key lambda x2 into
02:30 - x3 so what is it is doing so it is just
02:34 - arranging your faces like if you have
02:36 - multiple faces in the video field
02:38 - like if i show my face my sister's face
02:40 - my brother's face
02:41 - my parents face my every my friend's
02:44 - face so
02:45 - multiple number of faces will come right
02:47 - and we have to sort that faces in
02:49 - increasing or decreasing order as per
02:50 - our need
02:52 - okay so what we are doing here is we are
02:55 - passing the function name sorted and we
02:57 - are just using
02:58 - using a laptop function okay so in this
03:01 - uh this line mean that we are passing
03:04 - our faces list here
03:05 - like in this faces list
03:09 - we have uh x y h and w coordinates
03:13 - uh numbers okay and we pass this list
03:16 - here
03:17 - and we are just calculating so this
03:20 - means that
03:23 - okay so like faces lists like if we have
03:26 - faces
03:27 - then faces contains a list of
03:30 - x y w and
03:33 - h okay so it is zero index this is one
03:38 - index this is two index is three index
03:40 - okay so the area of image is built area
03:43 - of any image is
03:49 - [Music]
03:58 - okay this is width into height and this
04:00 - is basically area
04:02 - and the image which have larger area
04:05 - will obviously come first if we are
04:07 - sorting it in a decreasing order
04:09 - and if the area is less then it will
04:12 - come first in
04:13 - the sorted order if we are sorting it in
04:15 - an ascending order right
04:17 - so this so in this here so
04:20 - lambda x is just representing our faces
04:24 - and we are just using lambda function
04:27 - here if you don't like what is lambda
04:28 - function so let like
04:30 - just get a quick overview by seeing the
04:32 - documents
04:33 - documentations okay so x is representing
04:37 - this spaces
04:38 - and x2 into x3 basically is area of
04:41 - image
04:42 - area of the face for the area of the box
04:44 - which hasn't been
04:46 - okay and reverse is equal to true means
04:48 - which we are
04:49 - just arranging this in a descending
04:52 - order like we are sorting it in a
04:53 - descending order
04:54 - right so and these like if we are having
04:58 - faces like this first faces this second
05:01 - phase is this
05:02 - third phase is like small face then big
05:05 - face
05:05 - and small place and these all faces will
05:07 - be sorted in a descending order like
05:09 - first become
05:10 - big and small and then small this one
05:13 - okay so in this way we sort our faces
05:17 - and every data will be stored in this
05:22 - in this variable okay so i hope that you
05:25 - get a clear understanding of what we are
05:27 - actually doing here
05:28 - and now just forget this line
05:31 - as of now so now we are just we will
05:34 - just hydrate
05:35 - every and you'll just store every face
05:39 - in our data
05:39 - [Music]
05:41 - so now we are we are just i'm trending
05:43 - in our faces a
05:44 - so uh let us see that we are starting a
05:48 - for loop here
05:49 - and four log is going to end okay
05:52 - and this x y w h is are the coordinates
05:56 - of the face so face and faces means that
06:00 - it is like this is phase one this is
06:03 - phase two this is phase four
06:05 - like these are the faces and the
06:08 - coordinates of each and every face
06:10 - will come in this x y w and h variables
06:13 - okay as we iterate over every faces then
06:16 - the
06:16 - uh coordinates of every phase will come
06:19 - in x y w and h
06:21 - okay and this offset simply means that
06:24 - we are providing a padding
06:25 - so if you have done html before before
06:28 - you might know that what is padding
06:30 - which is what is margin
06:31 - so padding is basically uh
06:39 - so if we are having our face here this
06:41 - is our face then this gap
06:43 - is basically padding okay so this gap is
06:46 - starting
06:48 - sorry about the handwriting uh actually
06:50 - pen is quite bold here
06:52 - okay so if we are having a face here
06:54 - like
06:56 - and this is covered in a box then this
06:59 - box
07:00 - is having a padding of five okay
07:03 - so this length is basically five or five
07:05 - carry
07:06 - okay so we have just given the padding
07:09 - of five to like
07:10 - uh show a clear user interface okay
07:14 - so as before we are just having this uh
07:18 - this box as outer box which is which we
07:21 - are having the coordinates x y and
07:24 - everything
07:24 - so now here we are just extracting the
07:27 - face section
07:28 - so this line is basically extracting the
07:30 - section of a face
07:32 - so it is subtracting the offset so
07:35 - basically it is subtracting the padding
07:38 - and it is just uh calculating a
07:41 - particular section of a face
07:43 - initially there was padding and now we
07:44 - are discovering the particular section
07:46 - of the face
07:47 - okay and after that like you will see
07:50 - you can understand this easily like
07:52 - we're just subtracting offset
07:54 - from length from top and bottom
07:58 - and subtracting from left and right okay
08:00 - we are just subtracting our padding and
08:03 - just getting the section of face by this
08:05 - line okay just
08:06 - go through it once and by this face
08:09 - selection we are just resizing my face
08:11 - to 100 cross 100 image
08:14 - okay so i hope that you understand it
08:17 - and now this skip so this tip just means
08:21 - that
08:21 - when we start recording our face then
08:24 - after every second i will skip after
08:27 - every second or
08:28 - after every iteration this tip will
08:31 - increment
08:32 - okay like we have recorded one first
08:34 - phase second phase third phase
08:36 - like a particular uh time frame of the
08:39 - face
08:40 - is being recorded by this script by the
08:42 - script
08:44 - okay so after every tense phase like
08:47 - when i started the recording when i
08:48 - started recording my face
08:50 - so i recorded at first second second
08:52 - second
08:53 - third second fourth second i'm recording
08:56 - my face at
08:56 - every second okay so when i read the
08:59 - 10th second of
09:00 - camera i will just do a skip operation
09:04 - okay and after every 10th phase
09:08 - i will be recording this 10th face into
09:10 - my array
09:12 - okay i'll be recording each tenth
09:14 - hydrated phase
09:16 - in my array so that i don't have many
09:19 - faces in my area and i have a good
09:24 - recognize later so as you can see that
09:28 - like after each 10th 10th iteration
09:32 - i am just appending my face into the
09:34 - phase data
09:35 - and sprinting the length of face that's
09:38 - it and
09:38 - after and after that we will do in the
09:41 - next video
09:42 - before that just go through everything
09:43 - which i've checked
09:45 - so let's meet in the next video till
