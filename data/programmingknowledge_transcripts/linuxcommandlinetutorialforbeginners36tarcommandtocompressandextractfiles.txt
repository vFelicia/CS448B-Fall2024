00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux come online to total for beginners
00:04 - and in this video I'm going to show you
00:06 - how we can use Star Command in Linux tar
00:09 - command is used to create maintain
00:11 - modify and extract files which are
00:14 - archived in the tar format now tar
00:17 - stands for tape archive and is it's an
00:21 - archiving file format just like zip file
00:24 - ok so let's see how we can use tar file
00:28 - so for using tar file you just need to
00:31 - type T AR for the tar format and then
00:36 - you use some flags with the tar file so
00:40 - for example you just use C for creating
00:45 - an archive then you can use V V stands
00:50 - for verbose which is used to display the
00:52 - progress in the terminal while creating
00:55 - the archive file okay and then you use F
00:59 - flag to allow you to specify the file
01:02 - name if you do not specify this F flag
01:05 - then you know your Linux system is going
01:08 - to create a zip file which is going to
01:11 - be system dependent and its name is not
01:14 - defined by you right so let's see how we
01:18 - can use this so you can see on my
01:21 - desktop there is a folder called test
01:24 - right so to make it a tar file or to
01:29 - compress it first of all I will go to
01:31 - the desktop folder and then you can see
01:36 - I have this test folder right now for
01:39 - compressing this test folder using tar I
01:43 - can use tar as I told you then C V F
01:47 - Flags
01:49 - and then the name of your tar file
01:53 - whichever you want to give so for
01:55 - example test dot da R and then the name
02:00 - of your folder which you want to
02:01 - compress which is test right and then
02:04 - when you press enter you can see it has
02:07 - first showed the progress of compressing
02:10 - and then once this command is done
02:13 - at our file is created which is shown
02:17 - here right on Ubuntu if you are you will
02:20 - using Ubuntu you can just double click
02:22 - on the start for the file and it's going
02:24 - to show you this kind of you know folder
02:28 - extractor this is a GUI program which
02:31 - you also can use but most of time we
02:34 - must use or we I recommend you to use
02:37 - the star command to compress the file
02:40 - right now once again if I want to
02:43 - uncompress this folder once again what I
02:47 - can do I can once again write the our
02:52 - command and then for uncompressing or
02:56 - extracting we use a different flag than
03:00 - this see right see is for creating the
03:05 - tar file and then for extracting the tar
03:08 - file we can use minus X for extracting
03:12 - ok and then V and F flag will be the
03:16 - same and then the name of your tar file
03:19 - ok and what I am going to do is I'm
03:22 - going to remove this test folder so that
03:26 - once this tar file will be extracted is
03:30 - going to you know create or it's going
03:34 - to extract this folder again okay so tar
03:38 - and then xvf and the name of your tar
03:41 - file which is test are in my case and
03:43 - then press enter and then you will see
03:47 - this test folder is extracted from this
03:50 - tar file right
03:52 - now sometimes you also use the jay-z
03:56 - format which is Tom
03:58 - dot G Z and this GZ stands for gzip
04:03 - format okay and for this we use a flag
04:07 - called Z so let me clear the dummy here
04:11 - and once again I want to you know
04:14 - compress this test folder or directory
04:17 - to our tar.gz file so what I am going to
04:23 - do is once again I am going to you star
04:25 - and then
04:27 - - see for creating VF for robo's and for
04:32 - allowing the file name and then you use
04:36 - Z flag to you know create the GZ format
04:40 - for you okay and then the name of for
04:44 - your tar file sitar dot GZ and then your
04:51 - holder name whatever is the folder okay
04:54 - but you need to remember one thing here
04:57 - that just this Z flag must come after
05:01 - your C flag okay so C z VF okay and then
05:08 - press enter and it's going to create
05:10 - your Tod G's add file right and
05:13 - similarly to extract this folder I'm
05:16 - going to delete this folder or directory
05:19 - once again and then I'm going to just
05:22 - use star and then instead of for this C
05:26 - flag I am going to use X for extracting
05:29 - and then I am going to just give this
05:31 - command which is gzip file name okay and
05:36 - press enter and it's going to extract
05:38 - the file and show it here right so in
05:42 - this way you can use tar command to a
05:45 - compress and uncompress folders or
05:48 - directories in Linux I hope you've
