00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install QT
00:04 - framework with QT Creator on your Mac
00:07 - operating system so let's get started
00:09 - and let's see how we can do it so before
00:11 - installing QT framework on your Mac
00:14 - operating system there is a prerequisite
00:17 - which you need to fulfill and that is
00:19 - you need to have xcode developer tools
00:22 - installed on your Mac operating system
00:26 - so you can install xcode developer Tools
00:29 - in two ways
00:30 - let me show you both the ways so the
00:32 - first way is when you go to the App
00:34 - Store you can search for xcode here and
00:38 - then uh the result which will appear
00:41 - here will be uh this one which is xcode
00:44 - developer tools and then here you will
00:47 - be able to see the download button for
00:49 - xcode and you will be able to install
00:52 - xcode but when you install xcode using
00:55 - this method it comes with all the other
00:59 - developer tools like uh xcode IDE and
01:03 - then the sdks for developing Swift and
01:07 - other programming languages so this will
01:09 - take around 7 to 8 GB of space on your
01:13 - uh Mac operating system the second way
01:15 - which I will recommend you if you
01:17 - haven't already installed xcode via the
01:20 - app store then just for uh running QT uh
01:24 - on your uh Mac operating system so you
01:27 - can use this command so just go to your
01:30 - Spotlight search and then search for
01:32 - terminal and then you can install QT
01:35 - developer tools using this command which
01:37 - is xcode hyphen select space hyphen
01:41 - hyphen install this is also going to
01:44 - install xcode select tool and when you
01:48 - press enter in my case you can see I
01:51 - have already installed uh this tool so
01:53 - you can see it says command line tools
01:56 - are already installed use software
01:58 - update in the system to install the
02:00 - update so it's already installed on my
02:02 - Mac operating system if this uh tool is
02:06 - not installed when you run this command
02:08 - you will see a popup window where you
02:10 - will be able to see the install button
02:12 - and when you click on the install button
02:15 - xcode select tools will be installed on
02:17 - your Mac operating system so I will
02:20 - recommend you to run this command uh if
02:23 - you haven't installed xcode using the
02:25 - app store right so once xcode developer
02:28 - tools are installed
02:30 - let's start with the installation of the
02:33 - QT so for that just open your favorite
02:36 - browser and search for QT and the first
02:38 - link which will appear here will be from

03:09 - button but we will be downloading the

08:48 - will not see the QE Creator icon here
08:52 - yet you can see you can search for QT I
08:56 - can find the QE maintenance tools but
08:59 - but I don't find the QT Creator option
09:02 - right so what you need to do is you need
09:04 - to go to your Spotlight search and then
09:06 - search for QT Creator here and then you
09:09 - will be able to find the QT Creator I'm
09:11 - going to click on this QT Creator option
09:14 - which is going to launch the QT Creator

09:22 - here you will be able to see this option
09:26 - which says show in finder and when you
09:29 - click on that you will be able to see
09:32 - the location where QT is installed so QT
09:35 - is installed in my home folder and then
09:38 - there is this uh QT uh folder created
09:41 - and under the QT directory in my home
09:44 - folder I have this CT Creator so if you
09:47 - want to launch the CT Creator you can
09:49 - either go to Spotlight search and search
09:51 - for CT Creator from here or you can uh
09:54 - just uh search for users and then open
09:58 - the user users directory and then under
10:01 - users click on your user and then here
10:04 - there will be a directory called QT and
10:07 - then there will be this QT Creator
10:11 - application if you want you can also
10:13 - drag this QT creator app to your
10:16 - applications folder so just drag and
10:18 - drop this uh QE Creator in your
10:21 - applications folder and then you will be
10:22 - able to see QT Creator in your
10:25 - applications when you uh click on the
10:28 - Launchpad but but I don't generally do
10:30 - that because I know the location where
10:32 - QT Creator is present and any way I can
10:35 - open the QT using the spotlight search
10:38 - by just searching for CT Creator so once
10:41 - cue Creator opens let's try to create a
10:44 - very simple project which is a QT uh
10:47 - widget application to create a new
10:49 - project you can click on uh create
10:51 - project button here or you can just
10:54 - click on uh the file option and then
10:56 - click on new project and then from here
10:59 - you can select which type of project you
11:01 - want to create you have the basic uh QT
11:05 - application project and here you have
11:07 - the option to create widget console
11:10 - quick application or other options you
11:13 - also have the option to develop python
11:16 - related QT widget application you also
11:19 - have the option to create libraries or
11:23 - non QT project also can be created for
11:25 - example C or C++ applications and then
11:28 - you can also use uh this test project uh
11:32 - framework and import framework right so
11:36 - for now I'm going to create a very
11:37 - simple QT application so I'm going to
11:39 - select the first option and then click
11:40 - on the QT widget application and then
11:43 - click on choose and here I can give the
11:45 - name to my project for
11:48 - example demo
11:50 - QT and then you can also select uh this
11:55 - checkbox which ISS use as default
11:57 - project location for now I don't want to
12:00 - uh use this location as the default uh
12:03 - project location which is my home folder
12:06 - I'm going to change this location here I
12:08 - want to create my project under the
12:11 - documents folder so I'm going to open
12:13 - the documents folder and then click on
12:15 - continue and then you can choose the
12:18 - build system I'm going to choose the
12:20 - qake build system here and then click on
12:24 - continue here you can see the details
12:26 - about your classes which classes will be
12:29 - created by default it creates the main
12:31 - window class and the base class will be
12:34 - Q main window and these are the header
12:37 - files so for this demo application I can
12:39 - leave them as default you might want to
12:42 - change these uh header files and source
12:45 - file names when you want to create a
12:47 - real QT application click on continue
12:51 - here you can also create some
12:53 - translation files for now I don't want
12:56 - to do that but uh in your application
12:59 - you might want to do that so from here
13:02 - you can uh create or uh translation file
13:06 - for your language for example if I want
13:08 - I can choose English from here for
13:13 - different uh Nations you can see English
13:16 - is available for so many different
13:18 - nations I'm going to choose U English UK
13:22 - for example and then you can see this
13:26 - translation file will be created here
13:29 - click on
13:30 - continue here you can uh select the kit
13:34 - selection so here I only have one kit
13:37 - which is
13:39 - 6.6.1 I'm going to leave it as default
13:41 - and then click on continue and then at
13:45 - last I have this project management
13:47 - where I can select the uh Version
13:49 - Control like git for now I don't want to
13:51 - do this so I'm going to leave it as none
13:54 - and then click on
13:56 - done so once I click on done done my
14:00 - project is created and you can see uh so
14:03 - many files uh under my project so let's
14:07 - go through them one by one so first file
14:11 - is demo qt. PR here all the project
14:16 - related information is available so
14:19 - which version of QT I'm using which C++
14:23 - version uh is this and then what are the
14:26 - source files and the header files I'm
14:28 - using and then there will be also a QT
14:32 - design file and also translation related
14:36 - information is given here in your header
14:39 - files you will see main. window. Edge in
14:42 - your um source file you have the
14:44 - main.cpp which is the main entry point
14:46 - of your application and then you have
14:48 - the main window uh. CPP which is the
14:51 - window file under forms you have this
14:54 - main window.i where you can design your
14:57 - QT application so I'm going to click on
14:58 - on this and it's going to open this kind
15:01 - of designer from here I can uh select
15:05 - components like push button or labels
15:07 - and then uh drag and drop into my uh
15:12 - design area here so for example I want
15:14 - to select this uh push button I'm going
15:16 - to drag and drop it in the design
15:19 - area I can also change its properties
15:23 - like the name or text uh from this uh
15:28 - section here so you can see the object
15:31 - name is push button I'm going to leave
15:32 - it as default but you can change it also
15:35 - you can change the text uh so for
15:38 - example I want to
15:39 - display click me here I can do that and
15:44 - then let me also add a label so I can
15:47 - search for components like uh I want to
15:50 - add a label so I'm going to search for
15:51 - label and then drag and drop into my
15:55 - design area I can also remove the text
15:59 - which is text label the name of this uh
16:03 - widget is label so object name is very
16:06 - important you need to remember or you
16:07 - can view the object name from here in
16:11 - your production environment you might
16:13 - want to give the different object name
16:15 - to each and every wiget so when I scroll
16:19 - down I want to just uh change the text
16:22 - here and then I'm want to make it empty
16:26 - now what I want to do here is when I
16:29 - click on the click me button I want to
16:32 - display some text in the label so for
16:35 - that I'm going to select uh push me
16:37 - button right click here and then click
16:39 - on go to slot and here you can see
16:42 - different slots I'm going to select the
16:44 - clicked slot which is the first option
16:46 - and then click on okay which is going to
16:48 - redirect me to the main.cpp file here I
16:52 - can write uh UI and then I'm going to
16:56 - add this pointer and then select my
16:59 - label which I have uh dragged and
17:01 - dropped so the object name is label for
17:04 - that and then once again I will call a
17:08 - method which is called set text method
17:11 - on this and then I'm going to add the
17:14 - text which will be for
17:18 - example hello world here and then close
17:23 - the double codes and then end the code
17:27 - with this semicolon once you are done
17:29 - just save your uh code by pressing
17:32 - command s and then when you want to run
17:35 - your code you have uh these buttons here
17:39 - first button is for running your
17:41 - application you also have the button for
17:43 - building your application so this Hammer
17:45 - button is for building your project so
17:47 - I'm going to click on the hammer button
17:49 - here which is going to uh give me get
17:53 - this kind of uh window I'm going to
17:56 - click on save all which is going to
17:58 - start start the build process you can
17:59 - see the build process in this progress
18:02 - bar also so you can see uh build is
18:06 - successful so when I click on this
18:08 - process it's going to open this kind of
18:10 - terminal and then I don't see any errors
18:13 - here so build was successful and then I
18:16 - can run this uh app by clicking on this
18:19 - run button so when I click on run button
18:22 - it's going to launch this kind of uh
18:25 - window which is the QT window and when I
18:27 - click on click me it prints hello world
18:31 - on the label so everything is working
18:34 - fine and this is how you can download
18:36 - and install QT with QT Creator on your
18:39 - Mac operating system I hope you've
