00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - programming knowledge this is the second
00:04 - video of a five-part video series of how
00:08 - to create user registration form using
00:11 - PHP so in the previous tutorial we have
00:14 - laid out the basic structure of our
00:16 - project so we have already implemented
00:19 - the form or the basic form of our user
00:23 - Association so as promised in the first
00:27 - video we will continue working on with
00:29 - the implementation of the PHP code
00:32 - behind user registration so before doing
00:35 - that we need to step back and reflect on
00:39 - our design of the user registration page
00:43 - so as you can see we have the the very
00:48 - basic looks of our user Association page
00:51 - and we want to improve this so in order
00:55 - for us to improve the looks of this
00:58 - registration page we need the powers of
01:01 - the bootstrap library so all we have to
01:05 - do now is download the components or the
01:07 - CSS files or the GS files included in
01:10 - the bootstrap so let's go ahead and type
01:14 - in Google and bootstrap so we have you
01:22 - the first link to bootstrap site so
01:25 - let's just click on this and click on
01:33 - this download button so we have few
01:38 - options here we could just include the
01:41 - compiled CSS and GS into our files we
01:44 - could download the source files we could
01:47 - actually use the C the end of our
01:50 - bootstrap but with the purpose of this
01:54 - tutorial we'll be using or will be
01:58 - downloading the files directly or this
02:01 - compiled CSS and jes so download
02:08 - and then save force okay so once the
02:16 - file has been downloaded we just need to
02:18 - locate the files in our system and
02:20 - includes or include the necessary files
02:23 - such as the CSS and J's files into our
02:26 - project so I have here the downloaded
02:29 - file which is bootstrap in my case this
02:31 - is version 4.3 point 1 so all we need is
02:35 - to extract the file and copy the CSS and
02:43 - J's file or GS files inside this
02:46 - bootstrap taste folder and paste the CSS
02:50 - and J's files into the project that we
02:54 - have created earlier and make sure it is
02:56 - located side by side with our defined
03:00 - files which is the config index that PHP
03:02 - and registration that PHP okay so once
03:06 - we have that we just need to open up our
03:09 - registration that PHP to actually
03:11 - include the CSS files from bootstrap so
03:16 - open up registration that PHP and inside
03:18 - the head tag of our HTML let's include
03:22 - the CSS coming from the CSS folder here
03:26 - in our project ok so link with a type of
03:33 - startx or CSS and then for the reference
03:37 - we need to type in CSS slash and we're
03:44 - going to use the minified version of the
03:48 - bootstrap CSS so let's just use this
03:50 - bootstrap that mean that CSS so
03:54 - bootstrap that means that CSS okay and
04:03 - let's try the or let's try to reload our
04:07 - page before that make sure that you have
04:11 - saved the registration that PHP and
04:13 - let's go to our browser and refresh our
04:17 - page so as you can see we know that the
04:20 - C
04:21 - working because the layout of our page
04:24 - change which corresponds to the styles
04:28 - that have been said in the CSS file so
04:34 - we just need to add few classes to the
04:38 - mark-up for this input so the inputs for
04:41 - first name last name and also we want to
04:44 - change the or we want to add some
04:46 - classes to the signup button so it would
04:49 - look like a professional button so all
04:52 - we have to do now is go back to our PHP
04:54 - or registration that PHP code and inside
04:58 - this div with the class container let's
05:02 - define a new div which has a class of
05:05 - row so div then row and make sure that
05:11 - we close this div to this point okay
05:15 - next let's create a new column which
05:20 - also uses the mark-up div and make sure
05:25 - that we close this live right here
05:29 - so let's indent our code so it would be
05:33 - readable
05:35 - okay so let's add a class to this
05:38 - division which is class call sm3 so this
05:44 - class is specific for bootstrap so if
05:48 - you want to know more about bootstrap
05:50 - you can browse their documentation and
05:52 - study the different columns
05:55 - configuration or the grid configuration
05:58 - of bootstrap so let us continue let's
06:03 - add a class to this input which is form
06:09 - control and let us just copy this one so
06:15 - paste this to add their inputs last name
06:19 - email a phone number and also with the
06:25 - password and save the registration dot
06:29 - PHP and try to preview our page open up
06:32 - the browser and reload
06:34 - page or registration page so as you can
06:37 - see the layout and the looks of our
06:40 - registration form is much better than
06:43 - what we have previously but we're not
06:47 - done yet with our styling perhaps we
06:50 - need to add a space here between the
06:54 - first name and the Philip form with the
06:57 - correct values and also with our button
06:59 - in the last input for password and of
07:03 - course we want to add the class for our
07:07 - button so let's go back to our
07:10 - registration that PHP so after the
07:15 - paragraph fill up the form with correct
07:18 - VAR values let's add a horizontal rule
07:22 - for this and with a class MB - 3 okay
07:28 - and let's just copy this one for this
07:32 - space between password and the button
07:37 - save the file and open up the browser
07:40 - refresh so we have here the spaces
07:45 - between first-name and fill up and of
07:49 - course the password and sign up and last
07:51 - but not the least is for the sign up
07:54 - button so go back to our registration
07:57 - that page P again and add class to this
08:00 - button which is class BTN and let's set
08:06 - this BTN into primary save registration
08:11 - that PHP and go back to browser and
08:13 - refresh there you have it
08:17 - it's not a word class form per se but it
08:21 - is much much better than what we have
08:23 - before so I think that's it for our
08:27 - styling and let's go back to our page P
08:30 - code and implement the logic for our
08:32 - user registration okay
08:37 - so previously we
08:39 - have started the logic which is to check
08:45 - if the post create is set and echo that
08:50 - the user has submitted the form so now
08:54 - let's get the values coming from this
08:57 - form which is so for example the first
09:01 - name and using the post variable and
09:08 - supply the first name which is the name
09:12 - of our input field and of course you
09:16 - want to use this to implement other
09:19 - fields which is this one for our last
09:23 - name and email phone number and also the
09:43 - password okay let's make our code
09:49 - readable by indenting it in one line
09:59 - okay so we have all the necessary fields
10:03 - or the fields coming from our form so
10:07 - now let's try to display all the values
10:10 - once the user has submitted the form so
10:14 - echo first name and then the last name
10:23 - let's just copy the the first one email
10:32 - phone number and password so last name
10:38 - or email and then phone number and
10:42 - password
10:44 - okay and of course semicolon at the end
10:49 - of the line save our registration that
10:52 - PHP and go back to our browser refresh
10:55 - and let's try to put some values here
10:58 - for our email to test at test com phone
11:07 - number doesn't matter for now and
11:08 - password and click on sign up okay so we
11:15 - have here the values and it has
11:18 - successfully displayed the values coming
11:21 - from this form so I think that's it for
11:25 - this tutorial
11:27 - and in the next video and try to work
11:29 - with the config that PHP thanks
11:40 - you
