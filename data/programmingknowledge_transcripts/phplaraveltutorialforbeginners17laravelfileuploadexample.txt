00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part 17 of our laravel
00:07 - for beginners tutorial and as a sort of
00:09 - review in the last videos we have added
00:14 - the access control for the post or blog
00:18 - post available in our project and we
00:22 - also limit the edit and delete buttons
00:26 - for those owners of the actual post so
00:31 - in this video we're going to add a file
00:34 - upload so in here so for example if we
00:38 - add post so in here what we want is to
00:42 - add a file upload where we can actually
00:46 - upload an image so we will be able to do
00:50 - that and let's try to go back to our
00:54 - code editor and open up our create that
00:56 - laid that PHP and we'll try to add the
01:01 - file upload capability in our project so
01:06 - under resources and then use post and
01:11 - then create that blade that PHP so we
01:14 - have here deform that enables us to add
01:17 - a post so we're just going to add here
01:22 - the element for our file upload so in
01:27 - here we need to add the live with class
01:31 - form group and of course we need to add
01:36 - the actual form element which is we're
01:41 - going to use the laravel collective's
01:44 - for that so form and then file and then
01:48 - we're just going to name it as a cover
01:52 - image okay so in order for us to submit
01:56 - or upload the file in this particular
02:00 - form we need to change also the ink type
02:04 - for this form in this particular part we
02:08 - need to add another
02:11 - which is the ink type for our form and
02:18 - then it should say multi-part multi-part
02:28 - /data
02:29 - and then save let's try to preview that
02:35 - refresh and then you can see here the
02:38 - file upload element where we can browse
02:41 - the actual file in our file system but
02:46 - if you try to select an image here and
02:52 - then submit it's not it's not going
02:55 - anywhere for now it's not saving to our
02:57 - database and it's not saving into our
03:00 - project because this is only the user
03:03 - interface and there's nothing logic or
03:06 - there's no logic behind this file
03:10 - element so in order for us to have the
03:14 - actual logic we need to go back to our
03:16 - auditor code editor and open up the
03:19 - controller so HTTP controllers and then
03:27 - inside our post controller but before we
03:33 - forgot I think we need to add first the
03:35 - attribute or the field into our database
03:40 - let's open up our database and try to
03:49 - add the field first by using our
03:53 - migration so I'm just going to show you
03:56 - here so inter post structure and we
04:02 - don't have yet the field for our image
04:07 - or cover image so we need to add that by
04:10 - using our migration so open up the
04:16 - terminal first and here we need to run
04:23 - the command PHP
04:26 - HP artisan and then make migration and
04:33 - then the name of this migration is odd
04:35 - cover image to the post okay okay so the
04:48 - migration has been created so let's open
04:50 - up it here in our database and then
04:54 - migrations so odd cover image to post
04:58 - and we need to add logic here to
05:01 - actually add the cover image attribute
05:08 - so table and then string this will just
05:11 - add the cover image into our post table
05:17 - and of course in here we also have the
05:22 - down functions okay so we're just going
05:29 - to drop column in here so drop column
05:36 - and then we're just going to say cover
05:39 - image and after that we need to run the
05:44 - migration so PHP artisan and then
05:48 - migrate so migrated if you try to go
05:55 - back to our page me my admin and then
05:58 - refresh our structure so we can see here
06:02 - the cover image field or attribute so
06:06 - now let's go add the logic to actually
06:09 - upload the file into our file system and
06:12 - also save the file name into our
06:16 - database so in our file upload as I've
06:19 - said there are two things that will
06:21 - happen so we need to add the string path
06:25 - or a dealer the name of the file in here
06:28 - in our cover image attribute or field
06:31 - and then we also need to upload the
06:33 - actual file into our project
06:37 - so now let's go back to our post
06:41 - controller open up our post controller
06:44 - and and here we need to modify
06:50 - let's just go close the terminal for now
06:54 - [Music]
06:56 - let's just close this and then we need
06:59 - to modify the store function so we need
07:03 - to add the validation for our cover
07:06 - image first
07:09 - so the cover image should be image and
07:16 - then it is nullable meaning the user can
07:22 - have the option to upload or not upload
07:25 - a file for their cover image and also
07:28 - we're going to set the maximum size of
07:30 - the file in to 1999 because most common
07:36 - page settings they're allowing only 2 MB
07:41 - of file upload so we're going to set the
07:46 - maximum size of our image into 1999
07:50 - which is almost 2 MB or 2 megabytes and
07:56 - then in here we need to set up few
07:59 - things so we're going to handle the
08:04 - under file upload and the file upload
08:12 - and in here we have to say request and
08:18 - then pass file we're just going to check
08:23 - if the user has opted to upload the file
08:28 - so else
08:31 - we need to set the file name file name
08:34 - to store yes/no image that JPEG so this
08:42 - isn't going to be the default image for
08:46 - our user if he has opted to not upload
08:49 - cover image for for himself so this will
08:53 - be the default so if the user has opted
08:57 - to submit or upload the file so it
09:01 - should say here we need to get fire we
09:05 - need to get the file name with the
09:07 - extension in here so get file name with
09:11 - extension get file in with extensions
09:19 - okay and then it should say file name
09:24 - with ext is constant request and then
09:31 - the file which has the name of cover
09:36 - image and we're just going to get client
09:40 - original original image okay and then
09:48 - we're just going to get just the file
09:50 - name of the file in order for us to do
09:55 - that so file name and then path info and
10:00 - then we're going to pass in parameters
10:02 - in here
10:03 - finally name with extension and we're
10:07 - just going to get the part
10:09 - info underscore file name so I think
10:13 - this video is further along so we will
10:16 - continue working on with this file
10:18 - upload in the next video so see you in
10:22 - the next video thanks
