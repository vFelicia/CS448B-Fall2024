00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming tutorial
00:04 - for beginners in this video we will see
00:06 - how we can create a text file and write
00:10 - in it using Java now to create a text
00:14 - file we need to import a package called
00:19 - Java io so to import a package you need
00:23 - to just write import at the top and then
00:27 - Java dot IO okay and then we can add the
00:35 - classes which are present in this
00:37 - package for example I want to import a
00:40 - class called file which we are going to
00:44 - use in this video or we can include some
00:49 - other files like buffer reader above a
00:52 - writer or print reader or print writer
00:55 - so this java io package contains a
00:59 - number of classes which helps us to
01:02 - input and output to a file now if you
01:07 - are little bit lazy and you want to
01:10 - include the whole package there is a
01:12 - wild card or the symbol called asterisks
01:16 - you can add to add the whole package and
01:20 - this means you want to include all the
01:23 - classes right which you are going to use
01:27 - so we are not going to be lazy and we
01:31 - will add the file class itself and one
01:36 - more class we are going to use which is
01:38 - called print writer so I'm going to add
01:42 - print writer okay now to create a file
01:49 - we need to create an object of a file
01:53 - class so just write file and give the
01:58 - name of the object is equal to new file
02:02 - and in the constructor you give the name
02:05 - to your file okay so for example file
02:11 - name
02:13 - dot txt okay so this is the name of your
02:20 - file or this will be the name of your
02:22 - file if you want to give the path I'm
02:25 - going to show you how you can give some
02:26 - particular path to create this file but
02:30 - for now let's create this file in our
02:33 - project folder itself okay now to check
02:38 - if this file already exists or not we
02:43 - add a check here if and on this file
02:48 - object we can call a method called
02:53 - exists and it returns boolean value okay
02:57 - and if the file exists it returns true
03:01 - otherwise it returns false
03:03 - so if the file doesn't exist
03:06 - so if file doesn't exist so we are going
03:09 - to add this not existing then what we
03:13 - are going to do we are going to write or
03:16 - create a file okay so just write file
03:21 - dot create new file okay so this is the
03:28 - check to check whether this file exists
03:31 - or not okay now if you can see here it's
03:36 - going to give you an error because
03:38 - whenever you work with files it has the
03:43 - chances to through some exception so for
03:47 - example your file is not present or your
03:50 - file is corrupt then it will throw an
03:52 - exception and basically right now
03:55 - eclipse is saying me that you should add
03:59 - a handler for this using try catch block
04:02 - for example okay so I'm going to
04:05 - surround it by a try catch block so you
04:07 - can just click this bulb and just use
04:10 - surround with try catch block okay and
04:12 - it's going to acts around this create
04:17 - new file with try catch block okay now
04:21 - if you want to be on the safer side you
04:24 - can just write a try catch block
04:27 - around your whole code okay so just use
04:32 - this around the whole code okay so it
04:38 - will whenever something throws you can
04:41 - catch it right now once you have
04:45 - enclosed your code in the try-catch
04:47 - block and you have checked if your file
04:51 - exists we are going to write some
04:54 - content into the file so we are going to
04:57 - create an object of print writer and we
05:04 - are going to call it as P W is equal to
05:07 - new print writer and the argument which
05:12 - it takes is the file object okay so just
05:16 - use this file object here okay now using
05:20 - this printwriter object you can call a
05:23 - method called print line as you can do
05:26 - with system out right so P W dot print
05:33 - line or print you can call these
05:35 - different methods on this printwriter
05:39 - objects so I'm going to use this print
05:41 - line object okay and in here you can add
05:45 - a text for example this is my file
05:50 - content or you can even add a number to
05:56 - your file for example some thousands and
06:01 - always remember whenever you create a
06:04 - file and you are done with working with
06:08 - file you need to close your file
06:12 - so on this print writer object PW we
06:16 - will call a method call close okay so
06:21 - once you are done with this code what we
06:24 - are going to do is we are going to run
06:26 - it okay and let's print something so
06:30 - that we know that our project has
06:34 - compiled successfully and executed
06:37 - successfully so I'm going to just this
06:40 - out
06:41 - and I'm going to say done for example
06:45 - okay so if we see done here then we know
06:48 - that our project has run successfully so
06:51 - I'm going to save this and I'm going to
06:53 - run my program and it says done okay so
06:58 - that means our project or executable
07:01 - file has run successfully but where this
07:04 - file is generated so let's see now when
07:08 - you go to the properties of your project
07:12 - so right-click your project and grow
07:14 - through the properties and in the
07:16 - location you will see the location of
07:19 - your project so just copy this path here
07:22 - and go to your folder explorer and paste
07:26 - this path and press enter and you will
07:30 - reach to your project folder and you can
07:33 - see here this file name dot txt is
07:37 - created so when you open this file you
07:40 - will be able to see the content so the
07:42 - first line and the second line okay
07:45 - now I'm going to delete this file and
07:49 - run it once again so delete and we are
07:51 - going to run our program once again and
07:54 - let's see if the file is created again
07:56 - or not so run it and let's see in the
08:00 - folder Explorer and file is created okay
08:04 - now let's change the name of the file
08:06 - for example file name one and save our
08:09 - program and run it once again and let's
08:11 - see in the folder Explorer and we can
08:14 - see file name one dot text is created
08:17 - okay so in this way you can create a
08:19 - file using java io package in java there
08:26 - are different ways of creating a file
08:28 - and this is one way of creating the
08:31 - other ways I will cover in the next
08:33 - videos so I hope you have enjoyed this
08:35 - video please rate comment and subscribe
08:36 - and bye for now
