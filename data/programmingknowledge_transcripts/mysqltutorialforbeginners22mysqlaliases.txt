00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in this video we will see that
00:05 - how you can use allies name for the
00:09 - columns in my stream so first of all of
00:13 - one terminal
00:19 - - QL
00:21 - - you be password
00:32 - let us see the list of databases we have
00:40 - data this database here use show tables
00:56 - we have student table here select from
01:10 - school okay we have roll number name and
01:15 - solemn as you can see when I write
01:19 - select star from student the name of the
01:23 - fields are same as we have described
01:27 - when we have created this table so but
01:32 - now consider a scenario I want to see
01:36 - the list of students but instead of
01:41 - wrong number I want to display idea I
01:44 - don't want to alter or modify my schema
01:49 - or table but I want that while
01:53 - displaying this table roll numbers
01:56 - should be changed with ID so we can use
02:00 - this with the help of allies I right
02:05 - select ID sorry still acronym
02:18 - as now I want to make it ID so I write
02:26 - ID from table name as you can see the
02:35 - values are of roll numbers but instead
02:40 - of roll number it will display ID now
02:45 - there is one more use of allies
02:48 - we can also concatenate the records
02:55 - select we write select roll number is ID
03:14 - now I want to concave the name and
03:21 - surname field so I write Kinkaid name in
03:30 - space then surname and I want to display
03:36 - it as full name from student table
03:58 - as you can see this is the first name
04:03 - and this is the last name and it can
04:06 - conceal content concurrently as you can
04:15 - see this is the first name and this is
04:19 - the last name and the result is showing
04:23 - by concatenating both of the fields as
04:27 - full name so this is how you can use
04:34 - allies name for column just close this
04:40 - open MySQL workbench
05:02 - okay now let us see one more example I
05:08 - want to concatenate all of these three
05:12 - face and name it as personal info okay
05:19 - so I use select Kincaid I want to
05:26 - complete rule number in space then you
05:41 - name again space and then sir me okay as
05:54 - personal details from name of the table
06:00 - as you can see
06:07 - 5:02 Elizabeth Queen five and four Alex
06:12 - Russo five and five okay so this is how
06:19 - you can use allies name for column you
06:24 - can give alternative name for a column
06:29 - for this displaying purpose you can
06:31 - concatenate
06:32 - the result of Records thanks for
