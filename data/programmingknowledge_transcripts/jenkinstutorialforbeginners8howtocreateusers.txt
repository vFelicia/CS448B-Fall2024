00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Jenkins tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video I'm going to show you how we can
00:06 - create users in Jenkins till now we only
00:10 - have one user which is admin user which
00:14 - we have created at the time of
00:16 - installation of Jenkins now generally in
00:20 - teams we have different users with
00:23 - different rules so for example a
00:26 - software team can have a team lead which
00:29 - can be a admin then we have developers
00:33 - QA guys or testers or we can have the
00:36 - operation skies or DevOps guys who are
00:40 - responsible for the provisioning and the
00:42 - deployment of the software so for that
00:46 - we need to give the credentials to those
00:49 - users so they can login with their
00:52 - account and then they will be able to
00:55 - configure and build their own jobs so
00:57 - let's see how we can create users in
00:59 - Jenkins so just go to the home page of
01:03 - Jenkins and then just click on manage
01:06 - Jenkins and once this manage Jenkins
01:09 - page opens just scroll down until you
01:13 - have found the section which is called
01:17 - manage users so just click on the manage
01:20 - users and you can see there is only one
01:24 - user is there till now so we will create
01:27 - a new user to create a new user you just
01:30 - need to click on create user and then
01:33 - you just need to give the user name of
01:36 - that user you can say use a 1 and the
01:41 - password of that user and this password
01:45 - the user will be able to change later so
01:48 - you can just provide the initial
01:50 - password here and then just provide the
01:53 - confirmation of the password and then
01:56 - provide the full name of the user for
01:58 - example the user 1 once again and then
02:02 - provide the email address of the user
02:03 - and then click create user this is going
02:06 - to create the new user let's create one
02:10 - more user so this time they
02:13 - user will be user two and then I'm going
02:17 - to quickly provide the password confirm
02:20 - password and then the full name this
02:24 - will be user two for example and then
02:28 - the email ID and then create user which
02:31 - is going to create the user so now we
02:33 - have two users so you can see we are
02:37 - logged in with the admin user so let's
02:40 - log out and then let's log in with the
02:43 - user one credentials so just give the
02:47 - username and password of that user and
02:50 - then just login and now you can see I'm
02:53 - logged in with the user one account now
02:57 - you can see a little arrow icon here
03:01 - beside the user one name so you just can
03:05 - click on that and just click on the
03:08 - configure option and once you click on
03:11 - that here you can provide some more
03:14 - configuration option for this user one
03:18 - account so some description what is his
03:21 - title or what is his job and then API
03:24 - token so you can see the API token this
03:29 - we will discuss in the later videos how
03:32 - we can use the API token for the user
03:34 - but you should know you can find this
03:37 - API token here and then the credentials
03:40 - the email ID and the password can be
03:44 - changed later from here so user one can
03:47 - change his password from here and also
03:51 - the ssh public keys so if this user has
03:54 - to authenticate with his keys then you
03:58 - can provide the public key here and if
04:01 - you want some help you can just click on
04:04 - this question mark and you will be able
04:07 - to see some hint here so this says list
04:10 - as a search public keys that are
04:13 - associated with the user these keys can
04:16 - be used for example by Jenkins CLI so
04:20 - Jenkins CLI we are going to see how we
04:23 - can use Jenkins CLI in
04:25 - later video so if you are curious about
04:28 - Jenkins CLI then we will see it later so
04:32 - this is how you can provide the
04:33 - configuration for the user in Jenkins
04:36 - and after the configuration you can just
04:39 - save the configuration and then the
04:42 - configuration will be saved now let me
04:45 - log out once again and let me login with
04:48 - the admin credentials once again and you
04:51 - can see the admin have the access to
04:54 - view all the project and when I log in
04:57 - with the user one account or user to
05:01 - account he also have the access to view
05:04 - all the project here in addition you can
05:07 - see the manage Jenkins option for the
05:10 - user one also and when I click on that
05:13 - this user have all the access to change
05:16 - the configuration of the system or
05:19 - change the global security or he have
05:23 - the access to do anything which admin
05:26 - user can do and this can be a problem
05:29 - for example this user one is a developer
05:32 - and he has all the admin rights and this
05:36 - is sometimes not desirable the admin
05:38 - right must lie in the hands of the admin
05:42 - only so for that we have the option to
05:45 - install some plugins and then provide
05:48 - the access to the roles which this user
05:52 - have so we will see how we can install
05:55 - this plug-in to assign roles or manage
05:59 - roles or manage users in the next video
