00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Scala and SBT on your Ubuntu operating
00:06 - system as BT stands for scalable tool
00:09 - which is the defect to build tool for
00:12 - Scala so let's get started so first of
00:15 - all Scala
00:17 - let's visit to the Scala website so just
00:21 - search for Scala and the first link
00:23 - which will appear here will be from
00:25 - Scala - language e so I'm going to click
00:28 - this link and then I will click on
00:31 - downloads and the first thing it says is
00:35 - you need to have Java installed on your
00:38 - system
00:38 - so because Scala runs on JVM you need to
00:43 - install Java 8 on your system before
00:47 - installing Scala so we will just install
00:51 - first of all java jdk and then we will
00:54 - install scala so for installing Java JDK
00:57 - just open your terminal and just give
01:00 - this command which is sudo apt - get
01:02 - installed open JDK -8 - JDK this command
01:08 - and all the other commands I'm going to
01:09 - give you in the description of this
01:11 - video so you can directly copy these
01:14 - commands and paste it into your terminal
01:16 - so the first command is sudo apt - cat
01:19 - install open JDK - 8 - JDK which is to
01:24 - install open JDK 8 on your system and
01:27 - then press ENTER and then give your
01:30 - password of your Ubuntu operating system
01:33 - and this is already installed on my
01:36 - system that's why it says that open JDK
01:41 - 8 is already in the newest version in
01:44 - your case if it's not installed it's
01:46 - going to install Java on your system and
01:50 - then you are ready to install Scala
01:53 - now to verify if Java is installed on
01:56 - your system you can just give Java C
01:59 - command so just give Java C version here
02:03 - and then press ENTER and if it gives any
02:06 - response that means Java is installed so
02:09 - you can see Java C 1.8 point
02:13 - zero that means Java it is installed on
02:16 - my system
02:16 - now let's go back to the Scala website
02:19 - and I'm going to scroll down a little on
02:22 - the downloads page and here I can see
02:25 - after installing Java the second step is
02:28 - to install IntelliJ which is an IDE to
02:33 - develop Java or download SBT in order to
02:37 - build your Scala projects but what I'm
02:40 - going to do is I'm going to scroll down
02:43 - a little and at the bottom I will be
02:47 - able to see these options which are
02:49 - other resources right so for open - what
02:53 - I need is I need to download this file
02:56 - which is Scala - point 12 point 3 which
03:00 - is the newest version at the time of
03:02 - making this video dot babe which is for
03:06 - Debian operating system right so we will
03:09 - download this they bin file and then we
03:13 - are going to install it okay so there
03:15 - are two ways of downloading this you can
03:18 - directly click on this file and it's
03:19 - going to be downloaded or you can open
03:22 - your terminal and first of all just
03:25 - right-click on it and then just copy the
03:29 - URL so just copy link location and then
03:33 - open your terminal once again so I'm
03:36 - going to go to my terminal and I'm going
03:39 - to clear the terminal first of all and I
03:41 - will just say double you get and then
03:45 - just paste this link which I have copied
03:48 - okay so which is this link okay so what
03:52 - you need to do you just need to
03:53 - right-click and then copy link location
03:55 - and paste the same link here okay and
03:59 - then press Enter which is going to
04:01 - download this dot debian file now this
04:05 - file is downloaded on my system so I can
04:08 - just do Alice to list out all the
04:10 - contents and you can see in the red here
04:13 - the dot debian file right now to install
04:17 - this debian file you can just give this
04:21 - command so you can just give sudo dpkg
04:25 - so just right dee
04:27 - pkg and then - I and the file name so in
04:33 - our case the file name is Scala - two
04:36 - point twelve point three dot dab okay so
04:40 - pseudo dpkg
04:41 - - I and the file name and then press
04:44 - ENTER which is going to install Scala on
04:48 - your system now the Scala installation
04:50 - has been completed so to check whether
04:53 - Scala is installed perfectly or not I'm
04:57 - going to first of all clear the terminal
05:01 - and here I will just give a command
05:04 - Scala
05:05 - - version okay so just to give this
05:09 - command Scala - version and if it gives
05:13 - this result which say Scala code runner
05:15 - version 2.12 point three then Scala is
05:20 - installed perfectly fine on your system
05:23 - so this is the version we have installed
05:25 - right - point twelve point three and now
05:28 - Scala version command gives us this
05:31 - version back
05:32 - that means it's perfectly installed on
05:34 - our system we can also start the Scala
05:37 - interpreter you can just write scala
05:40 - here and then press ENTER which is going
05:42 - to start the Scala
05:43 - interpreter and then you can execute
05:47 - anything from here so for example I will
05:50 - just evaluate one plus one here and
05:52 - press Enter which is going to give us
05:55 - this result which is two here that means
05:58 - Scala is working fine on our system
06:00 - right and to come out of this
06:03 - interpreter you just need to press
06:05 - control C and then you will come out of
06:08 - this interpreter now keep in mind Scala
06:11 - is not an interpreted language
06:14 - it's a compiled language now once the
06:17 - Scala is installed on your system
06:19 - the only thing which remains is
06:21 - installing SBT so let's go to our web
06:26 - browser once again and then search for
06:28 - SBT on your favorite search engine or
06:32 - you can just go at the top on this
06:35 - download page of Scala lang and then you
06:39 - can click on download
06:40 - as bt on the download page also and this
06:44 - will also open the download page of SBT
06:47 - website which is Scala - SBT dot o-r-g
06:50 - okay so either just click that download
06:54 - button from the Scala website or search
06:57 - for SBT which is going to give you this
07:00 - result which is Scala - SBT dot o-r-g
07:02 - you can just click this link here and
07:05 - then just click on downloads button and
07:09 - then this is going to give you this kind
07:13 - of instruction so these are the
07:15 - instruction we need to follow in order
07:16 - to install SBT so because Ubuntu is a
07:20 - Debian based operating system the first
07:23 - option is appropriate for us so we will
07:27 - follow this these commands in order to
07:30 - installs SBT on our system ok so I'm
07:34 - going to copy the first command and then
07:36 - I'm going to go to my terminal let me
07:38 - clear the terminal first of all and then
07:42 - paste this first command which I have
07:44 - copied which is this one ok and then I'm
07:48 - going to press enter and now I'm going
07:51 - to execute the next command so I'm going
07:53 - to just copy this next command and I'm
07:57 - going to execute here and then press
08:00 - Enter it is going to execute the next
08:02 - command and then the third command which
08:06 - is to update so sudo apt-get update and
08:10 - I'm going to copy and paste this command
08:12 - and now the updates will take place for
08:14 - the repositories and once the update
08:16 - command is finished we can just give
08:19 - this last command which is sudo apt-get
08:21 - install SBT ok so just copy the last
08:24 - command and paste it here ok and then
08:28 - press Enter which is going to install
08:30 - SBT on our system so I'm going to
08:33 - minimize this browser and wait for the
08:35 - installation to complete so now the SBT
08:38 - installation is also completed on my
08:40 - system let me clear the terminal once
08:43 - again so clear and let me just make a
08:47 - directory in which I want to give this
08:50 - as BT command so SBT will
08:54 - execute in a particular project right so
08:58 - you need to create a directory in which
09:00 - you want to create your project so I'm
09:03 - going to just create a directory in
09:05 - which I want to create my project so I
09:07 - will just - and KBI are SB t underscore
09:12 - project and then press enter and now I'm
09:16 - going to CD to SB the project directory
09:19 - and here I can give as BT command so
09:22 - just give apps BT and then press enter
09:25 - and for the first time it's going to
09:27 - download all the necessary files for the
09:29 - SBT okay so even though our project
09:33 - directory is empty
09:34 - first of all it's going to download all
09:37 - the necessary files for the SBT and then
09:40 - we can even create upload and if you see
09:43 - this kind of command prompt then you
09:45 - know that SPT is also working fine on
09:48 - your system right so if you see SBT
09:50 - underscore SBT project SVT project is
09:53 - the directory name or project name in
09:55 - which I'm working in so this is the
09:58 - directory name and this is SPD so SBT
10:01 - underscore your project name will appear
10:04 - here that means SPT is working fine on
10:07 - your system to exit you just need to
10:10 - give exit command and then press Enter
10:12 - and then you are going to exit from your
10:14 - SPT command prompt so in this way you
10:17 - can download and install Scala and SPT
10:19 - on your open to operating system I hope
