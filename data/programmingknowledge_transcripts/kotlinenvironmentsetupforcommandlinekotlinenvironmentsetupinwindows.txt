00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - kotlin on your windows 11 operating
00:06 - system
00:07 - so first of all kotlin requires Java for
00:10 - for its functioning so first you need to
00:13 - install Java so let's see how we can
00:15 - install Java and then we are going to
00:17 - see how we can install kotlin so for
00:20 - that first of all open your favorite
00:21 - browser and search for Java jdk download
00:24 - and the first link which will appear
00:26 - here will be from oracle.com forward
00:28 - slash Java forward slash Technologies
00:30 - forward slash download so just click on
00:33 - this link I'm going to provide this link
00:35 - in the description of this video also so
00:38 - you can directly come to this website
00:41 - and here you just need to scroll down at
00:45 - the time of making this video Java 17 is
00:48 - the latest version which is available
00:50 - for download so when you scroll down you
00:54 - will see the option to uh download the
00:58 - Linux binaries or the Mac OS binaries or
01:01 - the windows binaries right so we are
01:04 - going to select windows from here and
01:06 - then we are going to select the exe
01:10 - option here so just select the link
01:13 - which is in front of the installer
01:15 - option here so click on this link here
01:18 - so just wait for the download to
01:20 - complete and once this exe file is
01:22 - downloaded I'm going to click on this
01:24 - exe file and let me minimize my browser
01:27 - so first of all you will see this kind
01:28 - of window which says do you want to
01:30 - allow this app to make changes on your
01:32 - device I trust this app so I will click
01:34 - on yes and now I can see the Java jdk
01:38 - installer has been started on my windows
01:40 - 11 operating system so here you just
01:43 - need to click on the next button and
01:46 - this will be the default location where
01:48 - Java will be installed on your windows
01:50 - 11 operating system
01:51 - just remember this location so by
01:55 - default it's installed in C then program
01:59 - files then it's going to create a Java
02:01 - directory in program files folder and
02:03 - then there will be a jdk 17 folder or
02:07 - the name of the folder will be the
02:09 - version of jdk you are installing right
02:12 - so if you want to change this path just
02:15 - click on change and then change the
02:17 - destination otherwise if you don't have
02:19 - the good reason to change this location
02:21 - just leave it as default and then click
02:23 - on next
02:25 - which is going to start the installation
02:28 - of Java on your windows 11 operating
02:31 - system so at this point you just need to
02:33 - wait for this process to complete and in
02:36 - few seconds you can see the Java jdk has
02:39 - been installed on my windows 11
02:41 - operating system so I'm going to close
02:44 - this window that means Java is installed
02:46 - on my windows 11 operating system but
02:49 - still I have to do a few things first of
02:51 - all I'm going to just go to the location
02:53 - where Java is installed so just open
02:57 - your folder Explorer and then go to the
03:00 - C directory and then I'm going to go to
03:02 - the program files where Java folder is
03:05 - created and then in my case jdk
03:08 - 17.0.1 is created in your case this
03:11 - folder name version can be different
03:14 - just go to this folder right now in
03:19 - order to set the environment variable
03:21 - for Java what you need to do you can
03:23 - just click on the search icon once again
03:26 - and then just type addit
03:29 - and here which is going to show you this
03:31 - result which says edit environment
03:33 - variable for your account
03:35 - and it's going to open this kind of
03:37 - window
03:38 - you can also open this edit environment
03:40 - variable using control panel so you can
03:43 - search for a control panel and then just
03:48 - view by category here and then click on
03:50 - system and security then click on system
03:53 - and then once the system window opens
03:57 - you can click on Advanced system
03:59 - settings
04:00 - and then click on environment variables
04:02 - which is also going to show you the same
04:05 - window right
04:06 - so you can choose any method to open
04:09 - this environment variable window
04:12 - and once this is open you need to click
04:15 - on the path environment variable under
04:18 - system variables and then click on no
04:20 - edit
04:21 - and here you need to add the path to
04:25 - your jdk folder binaries
04:28 - so go to the folder where we have
04:31 - installed Java until jdk folder and then
04:34 - click on bin folder so we need to go
04:37 - inside the bin folder inside this jdk
04:40 - folder and then copy the path right so
04:42 - until pin
04:44 - and then copy this path from here go to
04:47 - the environment variable window once
04:50 - again and then you can double click here
04:53 - or you can click on new which is also
04:55 - going to show you this option and then
04:58 - just paste this path until pin and then
05:02 - press enter
05:03 - which is going to add this path to your
05:05 - environment variables click on OK so
05:08 - your Java environment variable is set
05:10 - now some application also needs the Java
05:13 - home environment variable on your
05:14 - Windows operating system
05:16 - to run them so let me show you how you
05:19 - can set the Java home environment
05:21 - variable also so you can go at the top
05:24 - under user variable section and then
05:28 - click on new here and then the variable
05:31 - name you need to provide here is Java
05:34 - underscore home everything is capital
05:38 - just write whatever I have written here
05:41 - everything is in capital and the
05:43 - variable value will be the folder which
05:45 - we have opened which is jdk folder so
05:49 - don't go inside the bin folder in this
05:52 - case just copy the path until jdk folder
05:56 - you don't need to go inside the bin
05:58 - folder in this case Okay and then just
06:01 - paste this path under variable values
06:04 - okay so you can see there is no bin
06:08 - folder added here only the path until
06:11 - the jdk folder click on OK and then
06:14 - click on OK and then click on okay which
06:16 - is going to set the environment variable
06:19 - for Java on your windows 11 operating
06:21 - system
06:23 - now once you have installed Java and set
06:26 - the environment variables you can use
06:28 - Java on command line so you can just
06:32 - open the command prompt by typing CMD
06:35 - once again
06:36 - and then I can type Java space hyphen
06:41 - version here and it's going to show me
06:44 - the version of java so you can see Java
06:47 - version
06:47 - 17.0.1 is installed on my windows 11
06:51 - operating system
06:53 - so once Java is installed on your
06:55 - windows 11 operating system let's start
06:57 - downloading and installing kotlin so for
07:00 - that open your favorite browser and
07:01 - search for kotlin and the first link
07:03 - which will appear here will be from
07:04 - kotlin
07:06 - lang.org so we are going to click on
07:08 - this link
07:09 - which will redirect you to kotlin Lang
07:12 - dot org website
07:15 - here you will be able to see this get
07:17 - started buttons just click on this get
07:19 - started button which will redirect you
07:21 - to this get started web page
07:24 - here on the left hand side you need to
07:27 - scroll down where you see tools so just
07:30 - click on tools
07:31 - and here we want to download the
07:34 - compiler from here and then under
07:36 - compiler just click on command line
07:39 - compiler
07:40 - so once you click on compiler you will
07:43 - be able to see uh the compiler options
07:46 - here also but you can also read this
07:49 - warning which says you don't really
07:52 - require this command line compiler in
07:55 - order to start using kotlin you can
07:58 - directly install IntelliJ IDEA or
08:01 - Android studio and start programming
08:05 - kotlin on these two IDE and I have also
08:09 - created a video about installing and
08:11 - using kotlin with IntelliJ IDEA so I
08:15 - will put the link in the description if
08:16 - you are interested you can watch that
08:18 - video also in this video we want to
08:21 - download the command line compiler right
08:25 - so here you're going to click on GitHub
08:28 - releases link here
08:31 - and on this GitHub page just scroll down
08:34 - you can see uh the latest version at the
08:37 - time of making this video is 1.6.10 this
08:40 - can change in future and when you will
08:43 - scroll down here you will be able to see
08:46 - all the links to download kotlin
08:51 - so I'm going to click on the first link
08:53 - which is kotlin compiler
08:56 - 1.6.10.zip file which is around 67
08:58 - megabyte file so once this ZIP file is
09:01 - downloaded I'm going to go to the
09:03 - location where it's downloaded
09:05 - you can see uh it's downloaded here so
09:09 - first of all I want to extract this file
09:11 - so I'm going to right click here and
09:13 - then I'm going to click on extract all
09:15 - which is going to extract this file
09:18 - first of all I'm going to extract it in
09:20 - the same folder and then I'm going to
09:22 - move the extracted folder so now you can
09:25 - see this folder has been extracted so
09:28 - let me close this this is the folder
09:30 - which is extracted and here you will be
09:33 - able to see uh kotlin C which stands for
09:36 - kotlin compiler and here you will be
09:39 - able to see few files right so what I'm
09:42 - going to do is I'm going to move this
09:44 - kotlin C folder which is inside my
09:47 - kotlin compile directory so let me just
09:50 - cut it from here and let me go to the C
09:53 - directory and I'm going to paste this
09:55 - folder here so let me paste it here
09:58 - you can see this Scotland C folder is
10:00 - pasted on my C drive so that's how you
10:04 - will know that your kotlin is in your C
10:07 - drive and the path is easy to remember
10:11 - so once you have pasted this kotlin C
10:14 - directory here go inside it and then
10:17 - once again go inside the bin directory
10:19 - and we need to set the environment
10:21 - variables for kotlin in order to use
10:24 - kotlin command line
10:26 - so just copy the path until the bin
10:29 - folder and then you just need to click
10:32 - on the search option and then search for
10:34 - environment variables so when you type
10:37 - few letters of environment variables you
10:40 - will be able to see this result which
10:42 - says added the system environment
10:44 - variables just click on this option
10:47 - which is going to open
10:49 - this kind of window here click on
10:52 - environment variables and then select
10:55 - path under system variables
10:57 - and then click on edit and here just
11:02 - click on new and then paste the path
11:04 - which you have copied until the bin
11:06 - directory right so this is essentially
11:09 - the path of this directory which we have
11:11 - copied and pasted it here once that's
11:14 - done click on OK OK and then click on OK
11:18 - so once you have set the kotlin
11:21 - environment variables we are ready to
11:24 - use kotlin command line now once the
11:26 - environment variable for kotlin is set
11:29 - you just need to open your command
11:31 - prompt so just search for CMD
11:34 - and then open the command prompt
11:36 - and then you can start using kotlin
11:38 - commands to compile and use kotlin code
11:42 - using uh this command line so let's
11:46 - first of all check the version of kotlin
11:48 - we have installed so just write kotlin
11:51 - space hyphen
11:53 - version and then press enter
11:56 - it's going to give you the version of
11:58 - kotlin which you have installed right
12:01 - so this is how you can install kotlin on
12:04 - your windows 11 operating system I hope
12:06 - you've enjoyed this video and I will see
12:08 - you in the next video
