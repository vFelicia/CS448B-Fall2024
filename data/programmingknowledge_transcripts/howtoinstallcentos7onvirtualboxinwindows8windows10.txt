00:01 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:04 - install scent os7 on your virtual box
00:09 - virtual machine so hopefully you already
00:12 - have uh downloaded and installed virtual
00:15 - box virtual machine and now we are going
00:18 - to download first the Centos ISO file
00:22 - and then we will see how we can uh
00:24 - install it on our virtual box so first
00:28 - of all open your favorite browser and
00:30 - search for sent OS and the first link
00:33 - which will appear here will be from Cent
00:35 - .org so just click this link and in this
00:39 - website you just need to click get sent
00:41 - to us now and then there will be three
00:45 - options available to download for you so
00:48 - what I will recommend is the DVD ISO
00:53 - version so just click DVD ISO and then
00:57 - this website is going to show you the
01:01 - mirrors of your you know mirrors of this
01:04 - ISO file which are near to your place so
01:09 - you can see actual country and then you
01:12 - can click any of the link which is going
01:15 - to you know enable you to download the
01:18 - Cent OS ISO file okay so click any of
01:22 - the link from here for for example I'm
01:25 - going to just click the first and you
01:28 - can see it's a 4 GB file so you need to
01:31 - wait for a while to let it download okay
01:36 - so I already have downloaded this 4GB
01:40 - file so I will not download it again but
01:43 - you need to download it uh you know on
01:46 - your computer first of all okay and once
01:50 - this sent TOS ISO file is downloaded
01:53 - it's going to look like this which have
01:56 - the extension of iso now we are ready to
02:00 - uh install it on our virtual box so open
02:04 - up your virtual box virtual machine and
02:08 - here first of all we will create a new
02:10 - virtual machine so just click this
02:12 - button which says new and then just type
02:16 - here send Os or any name you want to
02:20 - give to your uh operating system right
02:24 - now automatically uh type here will be
02:28 - selected Linux and version will be
02:31 - selected red head which is fine right so
02:36 - because Cent is really close to redhead
02:39 - but it's a free version so it's okay to
02:44 - select here red head 64 okay and then
02:48 - click
02:49 - next now in here the memory size uh
02:53 - which is given here is 512 megabyte but
02:59 - uh I have have according to the memory
03:01 - available on your system you can always
03:04 - increase it so for now I want to
03:07 - increase it to around 2 2 GB okay you
03:11 - can even increase it to four or five
03:13 - depending upon the you know memory
03:16 - available on your system okay and then I
03:19 - will click next now uh in the next step
03:23 - it says create a virtual hard drive now
03:27 - which is okay for us and and uh next
03:31 - option which says use an existing
03:33 - virtual hard drive which we don't want
03:35 - to use right so just leave it as default
03:38 - which is the middle option which says
03:40 - create virtual hard drive now and then
03:43 - click
03:44 - create and here the option for hard
03:48 - drive file type uh is uh popped up and
03:53 - we need to um you know choose or by
03:56 - default it's vdi format and it's a
03:59 - standard dir so you don't need to change
04:01 - it and just click next and in The Next
04:05 - Step you need to choose the storage on
04:08 - the physical hard drive so by default
04:11 - it's uh dynamically allocated which is
04:14 - really good because if you have the
04:17 - shortage of uh you know memory then it's
04:21 - it will be dynamically allocated and if
04:23 - you choose fixed then only fixed amount
04:26 - of memory whichever you allocate to your
04:29 - virtual machine it will it cannot be you
04:32 - know increased it will be fixed so I
04:34 - will recommend to choose the dynamically
04:37 - allocated uh memory and then click next
04:41 - and minimum uh you
04:43 - know hard risk or hard drive uh size
04:48 - which Santos need is 8 GB but it depends
04:53 - again on your uh you know computer what
04:56 - how much uh size or hard drive
05:00 - size your computer have and according to
05:02 - this you can you know allocate the hard
05:06 - drive right so I'm going to choose a
05:09 - little bit near about 20 GB and I will
05:13 - just click
05:14 - create and then it's going to create the
05:17 - Cent OS virtual machine on Virtual box
05:20 - but still you need to uh do some
05:23 - settings because remember we have
05:25 - downloaded the ISO file but we haven't
05:28 - given the location to this ISO file so
05:31 - just select your sent TOS uh virtual
05:34 - machine and then click
05:37 - setting and in the settings you can see
05:40 - there are several settings you can do
05:42 - from here so in general when you go to
05:45 - Advanced
05:46 - setting the second option says shared
05:49 - clipboard and if you make it
05:51 - bidirectional you will be able to you
05:54 - know copy some text from uh your host
05:58 - machine for example I have
06:00 - Windows as my host to your Centos
06:04 - operating system so you can copy and
06:06 - paste text from uh you know uh from your
06:10 - Windows operating system to the virtual
06:13 - machine which is sent to us and second
06:15 - is the drag and drop just make it
06:18 - bidirectional right next is the system
06:23 - here you can once again evaluate the
06:26 - base memory which you have allocated and
06:28 - if you want to increase it you can
06:30 - increase it right next option is
06:32 - processor by default the virtual box uh
06:36 - allocates one CPU to your virtual
06:39 - machine but again you can increase it to
06:42 - two or three or four I will make it uh
06:46 - use uh two CPUs okay and then uh the
06:51 - next option is acceleration which is uh
06:54 - fine for us the next interesting option
06:57 - for us here is storage
07:00 - and from here we are going to give the
07:01 - location of our ISO file whatever we
07:04 - have downloaded so just select uh
07:07 - storage and then go to controller IDE
07:10 - and then select this empty CD here and
07:14 - then select this round CD icon and then
07:18 - click choose our virtual CD DVD disk
07:22 - file and from here just copy the
07:26 - location wherever you have your sent TOS
07:28 - ISO and then give the location of your
07:31 - Centos s okay and select and then just
07:35 - open okay and then click okay so now you
07:39 - have uh done the configuration of your
07:42 - virtual machine for Cent then we are
07:45 - ready to start it so just select once
07:46 - again your sent TOS virtual machine and
07:49 - then click Start it is going to start
07:52 - the installation of send to us now this
07:56 - process is a little bit lengthy so you
07:59 - need to be patient it can take around 15
08:02 - minutes so first option here it says
08:05 - install sent OS so we need to install it
08:08 - so just press enter here in this
08:11 - stage and now the installation for the
08:14 - Centos will
08:16 - start so now the installation of sent
08:20 - toos has been started and it says
08:22 - welcome to sent toos and from here you
08:25 - can choose the installation language so
08:29 - I will leave it as default which is
08:32 - English but you can choose any of the
08:34 - languages available here okay and then
08:38 - click continue which is going to give
08:41 - you this option just click capture and
08:44 - then click continue once again now in
08:46 - The Next Step sent to us will give you
08:50 - few uh settings to do so the first
08:54 - category here is the localization second
08:57 - is the security third is the software
09:00 - and fourth is the system okay so we will
09:03 - do one by one each setting so first is
09:07 - the date and time setting and if uh you
09:10 - see this popup in between uh your
09:13 - installation you can just click uh this
09:16 - check box and then click capture and
09:19 - then once again uh click on this uh date
09:22 - and time setting and uh from here you
09:25 - can choose wherever you are situated
09:28 - right your Loc
09:30 - so for example I want to choose Europe
09:34 - from here and then I want to choose
09:37 - Berlin okay once you are done with this
09:40 - location then you can click this button
09:43 - which says done okay so date and time
09:46 - settings are done then the keyboard
09:48 - setting by default it has chosen uh
09:51 - English keyboard for us but for now my
09:53 - keyboard is German keyboard so I can
09:56 - just add this German keyboard by
09:59 - selecting the German language so if you
10:02 - have any uh special country keyboard you
10:05 - can choose it from here so German
10:07 - keyboard I will just add it and after
10:11 - adding it just click done here now the
10:14 - next setting is the language support you
10:17 - can choose any language support from
10:19 - here for now I will leave it as English
10:22 - but you can choose whatever language
10:24 - support you want and then click done
10:27 - here okay now in sec security just click
10:30 - the security policy and for now I don't
10:34 - want to change anything here so I will
10:37 - click done once again and then the
10:41 - installation Source it's going to ask
10:44 - because we have already uh given the ISO
10:47 - file path so it's going to autod detect
10:49 - it and we don't need to anything right
10:52 - so click done once again and then we
10:55 - have software selection this is the
10:58 - important step because from here you're
11:01 - going to choose what kind of environment
11:04 - Centos s environment I'm talking about
11:07 - what kind of Centos environment you want
11:09 - to install right so there is minimal
11:13 - install compute node and basic web
11:17 - server so what we or what I am going to
11:21 - suggest you is I'm going to choose this
11:23 - option which says server with GUI okay
11:28 - and these uh you know these all the
11:32 - softwares you can install later also so
11:35 - I'm going not going to check them right
11:38 - now but uh you can anytime install them
11:41 - later okay so for now just choose server
11:44 - with GUI and then click done and now the
11:49 - important step which will appear here
11:52 - will be the installation destination
11:56 - okay so just click this uh option and
11:59 - and uh for now everything is okay
12:02 - because uh we have already given the
12:04 - size and just make sure that this

12:11 - selected from here and then click done
12:14 - from here and after this setting is
12:17 - saved you can see this begin
12:20 - installation uh button is enabled and
12:23 - you just need to click begin
12:25 - installation now the installation will
12:28 - start automatically which is going to
12:30 - take some time but in between this time
12:32 - you can set your root password and you
12:36 - can even create a new user so we are
12:39 - going to create both the things first we
12:41 - will create root password and in here
12:45 - you just need to uh give the root
12:48 - password whatever you want so I'm going
12:51 - to give uh the root password as I
12:55 - need and just remember this root
12:57 - password which which is going to help
13:00 - you whenever you want to uh you know use
13:02 - Cent as a root user and then click done
13:07 - and the next thing is we are going to
13:08 - create a user so just click user
13:12 - creation and the username I want to give
13:15 - here is code uh
13:18 - bind and username I'm going to leave it
13:21 - as default so full name and username
13:24 - will be same for me but you can change
13:26 - them okay and then give the
13:30 - password for the
13:34 - user and then once you are done with
13:37 - this you can even make this user
13:40 - administrator okay so just click this
13:43 - option which says make this user
13:45 - administrator and then click done so we
13:49 - have already uh created a new user and
13:53 - we have set the root password now we
13:56 - need to wait for some time until this
13:59 - progress bar reaches 100% And we need to
14:02 - wait for the installation to complete so
14:04 - I will pause this video and wait for the
14:07 - installation to complete so now the
14:09 - installation of Centos on our virtual
14:12 - machine is done and it says Centos is
14:14 - now successfully installed and ready for
14:17 - you to use go ahead and reboot to
14:21 - restart but before uh clicking this
