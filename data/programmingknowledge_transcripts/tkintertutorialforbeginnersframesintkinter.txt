00:03 - hey everyone today we're gonna talk
00:06 - about grouping and organizing widgets in
00:08 - the master window and we're gonna make
00:10 - use of frame class and pack geometry
00:12 - manager a frame in itself will work like
00:15 - a container a frame is a rectangular
00:17 - region that would be used to arrange
00:19 - positions of other widgets
00:22 - so basically it is used to organize a
00:24 - group of widgets so let me start writing
00:27 - the program for it
00:32 - or I'll write from
00:34 - linter
00:36 - import start
00:40 - okay so I do not need to import every
00:42 - single module separately in enter I'll
00:45 - just write the class name I do not need
00:48 - to mention Tick Tock button or something
00:49 - like that then I'll take the screen I'll
00:53 - write when equals TK
00:55 - and brackets here I didn't need to write
00:58 - inter dot TK because I've already
01:01 - imported it
01:03 - then I have given the title I'll write
01:05 - win dot title
01:06 - let the title be friends
01:10 - so the third step was adding widgets now
01:14 - I will be adding widgets so frames are
01:16 - also widgets that helps in organizing
01:19 - other widgets I will take the button
01:21 - widget only
01:23 - since we talked about that in the last
01:25 - video so to organize my buttons I would
01:27 - use the frame class now I'll write frame
01:30 - equals
01:32 - frame
01:33 - and in Brackets when
01:36 - because I want the string on the window
01:39 - right
01:41 - so you can see that we can give a lot of
01:44 - arguments for frame
01:45 - so you can given PG this was for the
01:49 - normal background color of the frame
01:53 - then again given BD that is the
01:56 - water size and you can give in the
01:59 - cursor so the mouse cursor will change
02:02 - to this pattern specified pattern when
02:05 - you hover over the frame
02:07 - and then you can mention the size you
02:10 - can tell the height and width
02:12 - then you have relief here which was also
02:16 - there in buttons so it's the same here
02:19 - you can specify the kind of Border you
02:21 - want for the frame
02:23 - here I won't be specifying anything
02:25 - because I would be getting some widgets
02:28 - over it so it's no use it won't be
02:31 - displayed
02:33 - so with the frame class I have made a
02:36 - rectangular area and then I'll pack it
02:39 - to the left side of the screen so I'll
02:41 - write frame dot pack
02:43 - side equals left we discussed this in
02:46 - the last video while we were discussing
02:48 - back a little bit
02:50 - we talked about side fill and expand I
02:53 - hope you remember so I'll be writing
02:55 - side equals left in the argument we're
02:58 - back
02:59 - okay
03:00 - I will take up another frame so that you
03:03 - can understand what frames actually do
03:04 - the grouping would be clear so I'll
03:07 - write Frame 2
03:09 - equals frame when because I want this
03:13 - frame on the window
03:15 - and then I'll back this to the right
03:18 - side okay it's all right side equals
03:22 - right
03:24 - then I'll get my buttons I'll write B1
03:29 - equals
03:30 - button
03:34 - now last time when we declared the
03:36 - buttons you might remember that we used
03:38 - window
03:39 - as the master argument but right now
03:42 - since I won my button on this Frame I'll
03:45 - write the frame variable okay so I'll
03:48 - write frame comma text equals
03:52 - button one
03:55 - let the background be pink
03:59 - and foreground be white
04:03 - then I'll pack this button I'll write B1
04:06 - dot pack
04:07 - similarly I'll declare button two
04:10 - I write P2 equals button
04:14 - frame
04:18 - comma text equals button two
04:22 - and background color sky blue and
04:25 - foreground White
04:29 - and then I'll pack it
04:32 - P2 dot back
04:34 - then I'll have two more buttons B3 and
04:37 - B4 I'll get them on the second frame
04:40 - that I declared
04:42 - you might notice that I have not given
04:43 - any commands for the buttons
04:46 - so let's start focus on that because
04:48 - right now our main focus is
04:50 - understanding frames
04:52 - so let me get my button three and button
04:54 - four I'll write B3 equals button
04:58 - frame two
05:01 - text equals button three
05:05 - background purple and foreground White
05:11 - okay then I'll pack it
05:14 - let me get the button four
05:17 - button frame two
05:20 - text equals button four
05:23 - background let it be light green
05:25 - and for round repeat White
05:29 - then I'll pack it I'll write P4 dot back
05:35 - then I'll call the main Loop this main
05:38 - Loop would be called for the master
05:39 - window only the parent window so I'll
05:42 - write when dot main Loop
05:45 - so let's run this and see if we get the
05:47 - buttons on the left and right sides
05:50 - according to the frames
06:00 - so I can see the buttons the four
06:04 - buttons that I declared and they are on
06:07 - sides button one and two is on the left
06:09 - side and button three and four are on
06:11 - the right side because
06:13 - I have packed the frame
06:15 - one on the left side
06:18 - and Frame 2 was packed on the right side
06:23 - as we have not given any command to the
06:25 - buttons nothing is happening when we are
06:27 - clicking them
06:28 - you can think about how differently you
06:31 - can pack these buttons just like we have
06:33 - packed the frames
06:35 - you can use the site or expand or fill
06:38 - arguments and that's what we'd be
06:41 - talking about in the next video we'll be
06:43 - discussing geometry managers
06:46 - thank you
