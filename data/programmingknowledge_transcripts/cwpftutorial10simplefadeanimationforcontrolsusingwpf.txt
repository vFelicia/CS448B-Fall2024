00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use fade
00:05 - animation with your WPF
00:08 - control so for example I have this
00:12 - application which I made till now and I
00:15 - have this image in my main window so I
00:19 - want this image when
00:21 - I hover over on this image and when I
00:25 - leave the image area then it should fade
00:31 - in or Fade Out whatever I want so let's
00:36 - see how can I make it fade in and fade
00:39 - out with my mouse
00:43 - hover so let's get
00:47 - started just select your image and this
00:51 - is not specific to this image tool you
00:56 - can do it for button you can do it for
00:59 - background image you can do it
01:02 - for uh other controls also so I'm just
01:06 - giving the example for this image tool
01:10 - but you can do it for other other tool
01:12 - also bu but you just need to follow the
01:16 - same procedure so
01:19 - just click this uh image and go to the
01:25 - properties and go to its events here and
01:30 - what I'm searching for is
01:35 - mouse
01:37 - mouse leave event so I will search for
01:40 - Mouse leave event I found it here Mouse
01:44 - leave event just click here and double
01:47 - click this box and we will reach to the
01:50 - mouse leave
01:52 - event button action perform but first we
01:56 - need to import the animation name spaces
02:01 - so just go at the top and here we will
02:05 - import some name space so write
02:11 - using
02:13 - system dot
02:17 - Windows dot
02:22 - media dot
02:24 - animation so because this is a part of
02:27 - animation we need to import this
02:31 - so now once you have imported
02:35 - this what you need to go do is go to
02:39 - your image Mouse leave event which you
02:43 - have just created and here we will
02:46 - write image and whatever control you are
02:51 - using so because I'm making this for the
02:55 - image so this image that's why
03:00 - I'm writing their
03:03 - image so whatever control you are using
03:06 - just write the name of your that
03:08 - control and sorry
03:15 - what and give it a variable name I give
03:19 - it
03:20 - IMG is equal to once
03:26 - again image and
03:30 - not this one but
03:33 - but
03:34 - just cover it with bracket and
03:38 - then
03:41 - write
03:44 - sender now in the second line we will
03:47 - use the animation so
03:52 - write double
03:55 - animation and what we want to do is
03:58 - first we will give give this double
04:01 - animation a variable name so I will name
04:03 - it as
04:05 - animation itself is equal
04:12 - to new double animation and in the
04:17 - bracket we will pass some argument so
04:20 - first argument we
04:23 - want for our image is it should fade
04:27 - fade out so I will will give zero here
04:32 - so it
04:33 - will decrease your opacity to zero and
04:37 - comma I will give the time span for
04:40 - which I want to fade in so I will
04:44 - write time
04:48 - span Dot
04:51 - from
04:53 - seconds and give the number of seconds
04:57 - so for example 2 seconds
05:01 - okay so you have written these two lines
05:04 - and then in next line what you need to
05:07 - do
05:08 - is just copy this image variable from
05:12 - here
05:13 - IMG and write
05:16 - dot begin
05:19 - animation in the bracket we will pass
05:22 - two
05:23 - arguments first argument
05:28 - is image AG
05:34 - dot opacity property this
05:38 - one
05:40 - comma this double animation so just copy
05:44 - this variable name animation and paste
05:47 - it here
05:49 - so you have written this for fading
05:55 - out and in the same way when we enter
05:59 - our Mouse Mouse in the image area in
06:02 - this image area we want the image to
06:05 - come back so once again select this
06:09 - image here and go to the
06:13 - properties and go to event once again
06:17 - and this time we are searching for Mouse
06:20 - enter so just select this mouse enter
06:24 - here and double click
06:26 - it and in the code what you we are going
06:30 - to do is we are copying this code for
06:33 - which we have written for Mouse leave
06:36 - and just paste it here and just replace
06:39 - the Zero by one so it will fade
06:42 - in now when we run the
06:49 - program and see here we are seeing the
06:52 - image and when I leave the image area it
06:58 - fades out and when I enter into the
07:02 - image area it fades in Fades
07:06 - out and Fades
07:08 - in right so in this way you can create a
07:13 - create a fading effect in your
07:18 - application I hope you have enjoyed this
