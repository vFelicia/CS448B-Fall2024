09:04 - give a
09:07 - password and confirm the
09:11 - password and click
09:20 - continue and now the installation
09:24 - started so it will take some time to
09:28 - install this
09:30 - Ubuntu so you see here it's right now
09:34 - copying the files and it will take a
09:37 - while to install uh this operating
09:40 - system so wait for some time and I will
09:44 - pause this video and restart it if any
09:47 - important step happens
09:53 - okay so once you have uh completed the
09:57 - this installation
09:59 - this message will uh be shown that you
10:02 - need to restart uh your uh operating
10:06 - system now so all the processes uh once
10:10 - they are complete you will be able to
10:12 - see this message so just click this
10:15 - restart
10:16 - now and once you will do
10:20 - that it will try to restart your
10:24 - operating system and then you will be
10:26 - able to use obun to in your virtual
10:30 - machine so just wait for
10:46 - restart and generally I have seen that
10:49 - this
10:50 - restart for the first time it takes some
10:53 - time so what you can even do is you can
10:57 - just uh cancel this uh uh virtual
11:00 - machine which is running and restart
11:02 - your bundu once again by yourself just
11:05 - cancel this and
11:07 - click power off the
11:11 - machine and or you can give this send
11:14 - the shutdown signal I will choose this
11:17 - power of the machine and click okay and
11:19 - now you can restart it by this button
11:22 - once again start
11:27 - button and this time it will show you
11:30 - probably the
11:31 - login
11:38 - screen so it's
11:56 - starting open to is started
12:01 - now so it depends upon the uh speed of
12:05 - your computer also how fast this open to
12:09 - operating system starts right so it has
12:13 - uh nothing to with you know it's taking
12:17 - so much long time on my computer because
12:20 - it's a little bit slow but if you have
12:22 - fast then it will restart very fast so
12:27 - now we can see the Lin screen just give
12:29 - your password which you have provided
12:32 - earlier and click
12:36 - enter and you have
12:39 - this operating
12:43 - system
12:44 - so let's wait for
12:57 - starting okay okay so now you have this
13:02 - open to operating system as a guest on
13:05 - virtual machine
13:07 - installed okay and by the way if you are
13:11 - curious why this size of this desktop is
13:15 - not
13:16 - resizing uh as you uh expand this
13:20 - virtual box because you need to you know
13:23 - install some more virtual box drivers in
13:26 - order to make it you know scratch this
13:29 - desktop so size will remain same for the
13:33 - first time when you install it but I
13:35 - will post a link below this uh video or
13:39 - I will just give a link with this video
13:42 - how you can uh resize this desktop size
13:46 - with your you know open to or virtual
13:49 - box so whenever you will just uh
13:53 - maximize your virtual box this will be
13:56 - also maximized so I will paste a video
13:59 - so just watch that and this problem will
14:02 - be solved so I hope you have enjoyed
