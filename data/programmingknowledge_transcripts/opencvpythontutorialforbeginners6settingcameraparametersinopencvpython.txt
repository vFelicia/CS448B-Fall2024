00:00 - hey guys when could be the next video on
00:02 - OpenCV t-told for beginners using Python
00:05 - so in this video we will see how to set
00:09 - some properties to our captured images
00:13 - so in the video capture lesson we have
00:16 - seen that when we create a cap variable
00:21 - using the video capture class we can get
00:25 - many properties using the cap dot get
00:29 - method so we were able to get the width
00:33 - of the frame and the height of the frame
00:36 - similarly we can use the cap dot set
00:40 - function to set some values so you can
00:44 - just write cap dot said and then you can
00:47 - set the values of the property generally
00:51 - all the properties which you can read
00:53 - like this you can also able to set those
00:57 - property using the set method now this
01:01 - notation you can also give in the form
01:03 - of numbers so every property here has
01:07 - are defined in numbers so for example
01:10 - instead of using C v2 dot cap prop
01:13 - underscore frame width you can just
01:16 - write 3 here and that will work also so
01:20 - every property has a number associated
01:23 - with it so using that number either you
01:27 - can just let's say we want to set the
01:30 - width and height either you can write
01:32 - this as the first argument and the
01:35 - second argument is the actual width you
01:38 - want in the video right or you can just
01:43 - give the number of that property and
01:45 - then give its value so let's say we want
01:48 - to change the width of this video to
01:51 - let's say 1 to 0-8
01:54 - and then let's just set the height so
01:58 - cap dot set and the associated number
02:02 - for the height parameter will be 4 so 3
02:06 - for width and 4 for the height and let's
02:09 - say we want to just move it to
02:13 - 20 and then we will once again print the
02:17 - value of the width and height and this
02:20 - time we are going to just give their
02:22 - associated numbers which is three and
02:25 - four so let's run this program you might
02:29 - already know this program what this
02:31 - program is doing so it's just capturing
02:34 - the video from your default device at
02:38 - index zero and then it's just showing
02:43 - all the frames using this I am show
02:46 - method in our window so now I'm going to
02:50 - run this script and let's see what
02:52 - happens so when I run the script you can
02:55 - see the size of this frame is changed so
02:59 - let's see in the terminal also you can
03:03 - see before the original size of the
03:06 - video we are capturing a 640 and 480 so
03:12 - width was 640 and the height is 480 now
03:17 - once we have changed the width and
03:18 - height you can see the width is changed
03:22 - to one two eight zero and the height is
03:25 - changed to 720 so even if I have given
03:28 - here one two zero eight the default
03:33 - camera will automatically set its value
03:36 - according to its resolution so let's
03:40 - just close this video and let's say we
03:44 - want to just change this value to some
03:47 - random number so let's say 700 by 700
03:51 - will it work or not so let's run the
03:54 - script once again and let's see what
03:56 - happens so the script is running and you
04:00 - can see that even though we have
04:02 - provided the 700 and 700 the camera will
04:06 - automatically take the resolution which
04:09 - is available for your default camera so
04:13 - the resolution remains the same even
04:15 - though we have set the different value
04:18 - to it so you need to keep in mind even
04:21 - though you can give any value here but
04:24 - the camera will only set that is all
04:27 - solution which is available for it so
04:30 - let's give a very big value here so I'm
04:33 - going to provide let's say 3000 here and
04:37 - hide also 3000 and let's run the script
04:42 - once again and see what happens
04:44 - so when we run the script you will see
04:47 - the resolution is changed but the
04:51 - resolution will change to the maximum
04:53 - resolution of my default camera which is
04:57 - one two eight zero and 720 this is the
05:00 - maximum resolution which is available
05:02 - for my webcam so let me just close this
05:06 - window so this is how you can set some
05:09 - values so there are many values you can
05:12 - set using this set method you just need
05:15 - to go to the documentation and then
05:18 - search for the value you want to set I
05:21 - hope you have enjoyed this video and I
05:24 - will see you in the next video
