00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Jenkins to troll for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:06 - send email notifications using Jenkins
00:09 - so first of all in order to send email
00:12 - notifications using Jenkins you need to
00:15 - know the SMTP server details of your
00:18 - email provider which you want to use in
00:21 - your Jenkins so this you can easily find
00:24 - on internet you just need to search for
00:26 - smtp server list and you will be able to
00:29 - find all the informations about the smtp
00:33 - server on one of the websites like this
00:37 - so let's say I want to use the Gmail as
00:40 - my email provider to send that
00:44 - notifications so you can see SMTP server
00:47 - details of Gmail is given here so this
00:50 - information I'm going to use in order to
00:52 - configure the email notification in
00:55 - Jenkins so I'm going to go to my Jenkins
00:58 - homepage and then I'm going to go to
01:00 - manage Jenkins and inside this configure
01:04 - system window you will be able to find
01:07 - the email notification setting at the
01:09 - very bottom so you will be able to see
01:13 - this section which says email
01:15 - notification and just above this section
01:18 - you will be able to see this section
01:21 - also which is extended email
01:24 - notification so this extended email
01:27 - notification is a plug-in which you have
01:31 - already installed at the installation of
01:33 - your Jenkins so if you have chosen
01:36 - install suggested plugins then this
01:40 - plugin will be installed in your Jenkins
01:43 - and you will be able to see this option
01:45 - but for now I'm going to use the default
01:48 - option which is the email notification
01:51 - option which is at the very bottom so
01:54 - here you will be able to see this option
01:59 - which says SMTP server so SMTP server
02:02 - for Gmail is smtp.gmail.com so I'm going
02:08 - to just give this information here and
02:12 - then
02:13 - you just need to give the default user
02:16 - email suffix the default email user
02:19 - suffix of Gmail is at the rate gmail.com
02:22 - and then you will be able to see this
02:26 - advanced setting button you just need to
02:29 - click it and then just check this
02:31 - checkbox which says use SMTP
02:34 - authentication and now you just need to
02:36 - give your user name and password
02:39 - username is your email address from
02:42 - which you want to send your emails so I
02:47 - will give my gmail address here so it
02:50 - can be anything for example example at
02:53 - the red gmail.com and then you need to
02:56 - give the password of that email address
03:00 - so I'm going to give the password of
03:03 - that email address and then I'm going to
03:07 - just check this checkbox which says use
03:09 - SSL and the SMTP port let's see what is
03:12 - the SMTP port for that so SMTP port for
03:15 - this Gmail so is 465 so I'm going to use
03:20 - this port here and then you will be able
03:23 - to see this section which says reply to
03:26 - I'm going to leave this as blank and you
03:29 - can also test your configuration for
03:31 - your email by sending a test email to
03:35 - any address so here in the test email
03:39 - recipient you just need to give the
03:42 - email address of the recipient so I'm
03:45 - going to give here the recipient email
03:47 - address and then I'm going to just press
03:50 - on this button which says test
03:51 - configuration and then it's going to
03:55 - send this email so you can see this
03:58 - message which says email was
04:00 - successfully send now in some cases you
04:03 - may also encounter some errors which can
04:07 - be resolved by just going to your email
04:09 - account by turning on an option which is
04:12 - called allow less secure apps so you
04:15 - will be able to see this kind of option
04:18 - and you just need to turn it on and you
04:21 - will be able to send emails from your
04:25 - gmail account to any
04:27 - email so once you have done the email
04:30 - notification configurations and you have
04:32 - tested your configurations you can just
04:35 - save your configurations and once your
04:37 - configuration is saved you can just go
04:39 - to the Jenkins job in which you want to
04:42 - use this email notification so I'm going
04:46 - to just use this Jenkins job it says
04:50 - hello world build and then I'm going to
04:53 - go to the configuration of this job and
04:55 - then I will scroll down and I will go to
04:59 - the section which is called post build
05:02 - actions and then when I just click on
05:06 - this list I will be able to see two
05:09 - options related to email notification
05:12 - one is editable email notification this
05:15 - is a plug-in so we haven't configured
05:18 - this plug-in yet so we will use this
05:21 - option which is email notification we
05:24 - have done the configuration for this off
05:26 - so just use this option which says email
05:28 - notification and then you will be able
05:31 - to see this kind of option for recipents
05:34 - so you can just give the email address
05:37 - to which you want to send an email when
05:41 - your build fails and you can see this is
05:44 - the option which is enabled by default
05:47 - which says send email for every unstable
05:50 - bill that means when your build is
05:53 - failed then this email will be sent so
05:56 - I'm going to just save this
05:58 - configuration and let me just break the
06:01 - configuration also so my champions job
06:04 - will fail so right now let's say this
06:09 - bill is Java C HelloWorld dot Java I'm
06:13 - going to just change the name of this
06:16 - file which doesn't even exist so this
06:19 - Bay build will fail and then email
06:21 - notification will be sent so I'm going
06:23 - to just click on build now and you can
06:26 - see the build has been started I'm going
06:28 - to go inside this build and console
06:31 - output and you can see this bill is
06:33 - failed and after this Java C command is
06:39 - failed you will be able to see
06:40 - this option which say sending email to
06:43 - whatever email you have used and when
06:47 - you go to your Gmail account you will be
06:51 - able to see this kind of email and then
06:54 - you will be able to find more details in
06:57 - this text here about your Jenkins so
07:01 - this is one way of sending email
07:03 - notifications using Jenkins the more
07:06 - advanced way can be by installing some
07:10 - plugin related to email notifications so
07:15 - you can once again go to manage Jenkins
07:17 - and we have already installed a plug-in
07:20 - at the time of installation which is
07:22 - email editable email notification right
07:26 - so I'm going to just scroll down where I
07:29 - will find editable email notification
07:33 - which is this option this one and here
07:39 - also you can give the same options for
07:42 - example for FS MTP you will be able to
07:45 - give smtp.gmail.com and then default
07:50 - user a suffix is the same at the rate
07:54 - gmail.com and then in the advanced
07:58 - setting you will have the same type of
08:01 - settings for example this is your email
08:04 - address from which you want to send an
08:07 - email and then this is your password for
08:10 - your email and then this is the advanced
08:14 - email properties which I will leave as
08:17 - default and then I will choose use SSL
08:20 - checkbox and then in the SMTP port I
08:23 - will just use 4 6 5 and you can do some
08:28 - more settings here one thing you can do
08:31 - here is you can add the default
08:33 - recipents here whatever recipents you
08:36 - want to use for your email so I'm going
08:39 - to add one recipe which I have also used
08:42 - in the last section and then I'm going
08:46 - to save this configuration and once my
08:49 - configuration is saved I can once again
08:52 - go to
08:54 - let's say I'm going to go to the next
08:56 - Jenkins job now and then I'm going to go
08:58 - to the configuration of this Jenkins job
09:01 - and then in the post build actions this
09:05 - time I will use this option which says
09:07 - editable email notifications so just use
09:11 - this option and then you will be able to
09:14 - find all these fancy options which you
09:17 - can change at any time important for us
09:21 - is for example project recipient list
09:24 - here so by default its default recipents
09:27 - you can give any other email address
09:30 - here and if you want to know more here
09:32 - you will be able to find more details
09:35 - here so it says you just need to add a
09:38 - CC : here or BCC : here so I'm going to
09:42 - add that CC and then : and then the
09:47 - email address and then I will scroll
09:49 - down and in the advanced SEC setting you
09:53 - will be able to find more settings so
09:55 - you can see trigger is failure and the
10:00 - email will go to the developers so we
10:03 - haven't added any developer email we
10:06 - have we have added the recipient email
10:09 - so I'm going to use this recipient email
10:11 - list and I'm going to remove the
10:14 - developers from here and then I'm going
10:16 - to just save this configuration and once
10:19 - you're a Jenkins build will fail it will
10:22 - send the email to the recipient list so
10:27 - in this way you can configure your
10:29 - Jenkins to send email notifications I
