00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:01 - show you how you can download and
00:03 - install latest version of Python on your
00:06 - Windows 10 operating system so first of
00:09 - all you just need to open your favorite
00:11 - browser and search for python and the
00:15 - first link which will appear here will
00:17 - be from python dot o-- r-- g-- you just
00:20 - need to click this link and in here you
00:24 - can find more information about python
00:27 - right and you can see here python 3.5
00:32 - point 0 is the latest version at the
00:35 - time of making this video and Python 2.7
00:38 - point 10 is the legacy version ok so I'm
00:43 - going to go up here and I can see this
00:47 - download button and I can choose the
00:51 - windows option from here ok so just
00:54 - choose this windows option and now you
00:59 - can see various options for the
01:03 - installers and you know web based
01:05 - installer or
01:07 - executable installer or embeddable
01:10 - installer so what we want is we want to
01:14 - have this executable installer which is
01:17 - 64-bit so just click this link which
01:21 - says windows x86 - 64 executable
01:26 - installer ok so just click it and the
01:29 - save the executable file and once your
01:33 - executable file is downloaded you just
01:36 - need to click on your executable file
01:40 - and I will minimize the browser and now
01:43 - our installation setup is started so you
01:47 - just need to click install now but
01:49 - before that you just need to check this
01:52 - option which says add python 3.5 to path
01:56 - ok so just check this option and then
02:00 - click install now
02:02 - ok and it's going to give you this
02:05 - option to provide user account control
02:08 - you just say yes and now the
02:11 - installation will
02:21 - so now python has been installed on my
02:25 - system and I can see this message setup
02:28 - was successful so I know that Python is
02:32 - successfully installed on my Windows 10
02:34 - operating system so I will click close
02:36 - and then I will go to this Start button
02:39 - and then go to all apps here and in here
02:45 - search for Python so under P category
02:50 - you can find this Python 3.5 3.5 is the
02:55 - latest version so just click this option
02:57 - and now you can see four options here
03:00 - first is idle which is you can say the
03:05 - GUI version of Python IDE and second is
03:10 - the Python command line option so first
03:12 - of all we are going to open this Python
03:14 - 3.5 command line option ok so just click
03:18 - this option and it's going to open this
03:23 - Python shell so to you know execute some
03:27 - code you just need to write for example
03:29 - you want to print something you can just
03:31 - call a function called print and then
03:36 - you use these bracket after version 3 I
03:40 - think you need to use these brackets in
03:43 - order to print something okay and inside
03:45 - the double quotes you can just write for
03:48 - example hello world okay and then click
03:52 - enter and it's going to print hello
03:55 - world here okay so you know that the
03:58 - shell is working now let's see how the
04:01 - idle works in Python which is Python IDE
04:06 - so just go to all apps once again and
04:09 - then go to Python once again and in here
04:14 - this time you just click idle ok so just
04:19 - click this option and it's going to open
04:21 - this kind of interface it works almost
04:24 - the same as the shell
04:27 - it's more convenient to use okay so in
04:31 - here also for example we want to print
04:32 - something we can just write print and
04:36 - then in the brackets you can just write
04:40 - your message for example hello world
04:45 - okay and press ENTER and you can see our
04:49 - output is printed as an output okay one
04:53 - thing is to note here is Python doesn't
04:57 - take semicolon so you don't need to give
04:59 - any semicolons here so in this way you
05:02 - can download and install Python on your
05:05 - Windows 10 operating system I hope you
