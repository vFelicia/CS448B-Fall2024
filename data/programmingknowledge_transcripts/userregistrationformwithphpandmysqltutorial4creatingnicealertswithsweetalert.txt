00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - programming knowledge and this is the
00:05 - fourth video on the five-part video
00:07 - series and now to create user
00:08 - registration form in PHP so in the
00:12 - previous tutorial we have learned how to
00:14 - implement or insert values coming from
00:19 - this form into database and in this
00:23 - tutorial we're going to learn how to
00:26 - implement jQuery and the sweet alert to
00:30 - replace our traditional feedback so as
00:34 - you can see if you try to implement or
00:36 - if we try to click on or type in
00:40 - different values here so email address
00:44 - comm phone number password and then
00:49 - click on sign up so we have the
00:51 - traditional feedback here successfully
00:56 - saved which is I think not that
00:58 - intuitive so we're going to implement
01:02 - the sweet alert to replace this
01:05 - traditional feedback and instead of
01:08 - inserting the values to the database
01:11 - using PHP we're going to use the power
01:14 - of jQuery to help us insert values to
01:19 - the database without reloading the page
01:22 - ok so first thing we're gonna need is to
01:26 - search for the jQuery library okay so we
01:35 - could click on or either on this links
01:39 - but let's try this the first link jQuery
01:43 - and click on the download ok so here we
01:52 - could actually see all the options that
01:58 - we have for jQuery or for including to
02:01 - Jacob to our project so accordingly we
02:04 - can just use the CDN for our jQuery
02:11 - they're also option here to just use the
02:14 - CDN or are the CDN is coming from some
02:17 - reputable companies such as Google and
02:21 - Microsoft or they're hosting also be
02:24 - jQuery so for now let's use this Google
02:28 - CDN so open this by clicking on this
02:32 - link okay so we could just copy this
02:37 - snippet for three point X or for jQuery
02:43 - version 3 point something so just copy
02:46 - the script and let's go back to our
02:48 - registration data HP and before the
02:52 - closing of the body tag let's paste the
02:54 - script and below this line let's test
02:58 - our jQuery if it's working or not so
03:04 - dollar sign and then function and close
03:10 - parentheses and open closed curly braces
03:12 - semicolon at the end and first let's
03:16 - just alert something for the document
03:21 - ready event so hello say registration
03:26 - that page me and go back to our browser
03:29 - and let's go to our user accounts in
03:37 - registration than PHP so we have the
03:44 - basic alert or JavaScript alert that
03:48 - says hello so I think the jQuery library
03:52 - is working so the next step will be to
03:56 - include another library which is the
03:58 - sweet alert so sweet alert will replace
04:02 - this JavaScript alert pop-up so let's
04:12 - search for sweet alert
04:20 - okay so sweet alert actually there are
04:24 - two versions with a sweet over and then
04:27 - the sweet alert - which is a newer
04:32 - version in DoD than the first one so
04:37 - sweet alert - is a beautiful responsive
04:40 - customisable accessible replacement for
04:43 - JavaScript pop-up boxes so they have
04:46 - here embarrassin between the normal
04:48 - alert and sweet pallor it - so first
04:52 - let's shout the normal alert by clicking
04:56 - on this button this is the native pop
05:00 - coming from the JavaScript and the
05:04 - second one shallow success message
05:06 - message so this is the suite under - so
05:14 - as you can see this is much much more
05:16 - better than the javascript native pop-up
05:20 - alert so let's go ahead and integrate
05:24 - this sweet honor to Tor project so go to
05:29 - insulation shine and we just have to
05:33 - grab the CDN coming from the J's dog
05:39 - deliver so all we have to do is copy
05:42 - this script or snippet and we just have
05:45 - to paste it below the jQuery library
05:49 - that we have integrated earlier okay and
05:52 - now instead of this alert we need to
05:56 - call on the sweet alert - and then fire
06:03 - and of course we need to view or define
06:07 - few things here which are the title a
06:11 - title would be hello world and text will
06:19 - be this is
06:26 - [Music]
06:27 - from 332 and the pipe will be success so
06:42 - let's try this
06:43 - go ahead save our file and go back to
06:47 - our browser and refresh our user
06:50 - registration or registration dot PHP
06:53 - okay so as you can see we have here a
06:56 - better and much cleaner pop-up which is
07:01 - coming from the street alert - so in
07:03 - real world this is from street alert to
07:06 - library okay now the next step is to
07:11 - include or to actually work on the
07:16 - jQuery so it would help us to insert
07:19 - values coming from coming from our form
07:22 - and insert it into the database let's go
07:28 - ahead and make some changes to our
07:30 - registration that PHP so in our form we
07:34 - have the submit button which is designer
07:38 - right so instead let's define an ID for
07:44 - this one or let us say register and
07:50 - inside here let us type in any register
07:58 - if it's click ok this should be function
08:13 - close here and inside this let's try the
08:21 - sweet alert a bit working or not so
08:24 - let's just check the sweet alert or once
08:29 - we click the button the submit button
08:32 - the sweetener should appear
08:36 - okay so for now save your file and go
08:41 - back to our browser and refresh our page
08:46 - and let's try to click on this sign up
08:49 - button okay so we have here these in
08:54 - alert so it means that the script that
08:56 - we're working on is working okay so
09:02 - before that let's set this aside for now
09:09 - because our primary concern is the value
09:13 - is coming from this form okay so let's
09:20 - add some IDs to this field so first name
09:28 - let's just copy this first name last
09:33 - name email phone number and password so
09:41 - this will be last name of course email
09:46 - and phone number and this one is for
09:52 - password so inside here at the function
09:56 - we need to declare a variable for our
10:00 - first name okay and then let's get the
10:07 - value by using the Val method and
10:13 - specify our ID for first name so copy
10:19 - and paste last name email address phone
10:23 - number password one two three four five
10:27 - so this will be for nesting and this is
10:34 - for email third one the fourth one is
10:39 - for phone number and of course for the
10:44 - password okay that's in dead
10:50 - so it should be readable so at this
11:05 - point we could actually perform a
11:09 - validation to these values right so
11:11 - first name last name email phone number
11:13 - password in so on but as you can
11:18 - remember as you can probably remember
11:20 - that we defined a required attribute or
11:24 - fields so so we can be assured that the
11:27 - values are not empty but we could also
11:30 - check for validity of our values so bar
11:35 - is valid equals this that for the check
11:45 - validity okay so we're just gonna check
11:50 - if the valid variable is true if it's
11:55 - true let's try to alert true and else
12:04 - false and we need to supply a parameter
12:12 - here and inside the valid is true
12:17 - condition we should prevent the poor
12:25 - from submitting because we want to use
12:30 - the jQuery submit instead of the
12:33 - traditional submit of d4 so I think
12:37 - that's it for this tutorial
12:39 - and we will continue implementing this
12:42 - in our last video of this five-part
12:47 - video series on how to create user
12:50 - registration form in PHP thanks
13:01 - you
