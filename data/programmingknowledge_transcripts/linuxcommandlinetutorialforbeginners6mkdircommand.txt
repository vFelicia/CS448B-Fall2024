00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will learn
00:06 - how we can use mkdir command in Linux we
00:11 - can use mkdir command to create
00:14 - directories in Linux so let's see how we
00:18 - can do it so first of all just press
00:20 - ctrl alt T to open your terminal and for
00:25 - example I want to just change the
00:28 - directory to my desktop folder so I will
00:31 - just write desktop and press ENTER and
00:34 - in the desktop I want to create a
00:37 - directory called image so I can just
00:40 - give mkdir command which is the command
00:44 - to create any directory and then the
00:47 - name of the directory for example image
00:49 - okay and I will press ENTER and then
00:53 - it's going to create this directory
00:55 - called image now for example I want to
00:58 - create a subdirectory inside this image
01:00 - directory I can just write mkdir once
01:04 - again and the directory name which
01:06 - already exists and then I will give the
01:12 - forward slash for the subdirectory for
01:15 - example I want to create a subdirectory
01:18 - called pics and I will press ENTER and
01:22 - then when I open this image directory it
01:25 - has this pics
01:27 - you know directory right now for example
01:30 - you want to create the subdirectory from
01:35 - the command or for the directory which
01:39 - don't really exist so for example I want
01:43 - to give this command for example MK dir
01:47 - on the desktop and then I want to create
01:51 - a directory called names and then I will
01:55 - give a name for example mark here okay
01:58 - so this directory names doesn't exist on
02:02 - my desktop you can see here right so
02:04 - when I give this command it will give me
02:08 - the error and the error says cannot
02:10 - create directory names so
02:13 - - mark no such file or directory because
02:16 - this names directory doesn't exist which
02:20 - is a parent directory it cannot create
02:23 - this mark subdirectory inside the names
02:28 - so in order to create the directory
02:32 - structure you need to use this flag to
02:37 - your mkdir command which is minus P okay
02:42 - and this flag you can use to you know
02:48 - create a directory structure okay so
02:52 - this flag can be given in two ways this
02:56 - is the short version of giving this flag
03:01 - and if you want to know the full version
03:04 - you can just give to - and then you can
03:09 - just give parents command here okay so
03:13 - the flag name is parents okay and if you
03:18 - give this command it's going to create a
03:21 - directory for you also and sub directory
03:24 - for you which doesn't even exist
03:26 - okay so I'm going to just give this
03:29 - short flag which is a minus P or - P and
03:34 - I will just press ENTER here and it's
03:37 - going to create this directory and it
03:39 - doesn't give me error and when I go
03:41 - inside this directory there is one more
03:43 - directory called mark here right so if
03:48 - you want to create directory or sub
03:50 - directory which doesn't really exist you
03:53 - can use - p f-- language with your mkdir
03:57 - command now for example you want to make
04:01 - or create several direct trees inside
04:05 - your parent directory so what you can do
04:09 - so you can just write mkdir command just
04:13 - right MK dir and then minus P and for
04:18 - example I want to create some directory
04:20 - with some names inside this names
04:23 - directory so I will just give the name
04:25 - of the names directory and then I will
04:29 - just give these curly brackets and
04:32 - inside the curly brackets I can provide
04:35 - the list of directory which I want to
04:37 - create for example I want to create a
04:40 - directory called John I want to create a
04:44 - directory called Tom for example and I
04:48 - want to create a directory called Bob so
04:51 - I want to create three directories
04:53 - inside this names directory so let me
04:57 - open this directory which is names and
05:00 - right now it has only one directory
05:04 - which we have already created so let me
05:06 - press ENTER and let's see what happens
05:08 - and when I press ENTER it creates some
05:12 - directory with this curly brace start
05:15 - and then the first name and then comma
05:18 - so this way you can create but you don't
05:23 - have to give the space between these
05:26 - commas so just remove the space between
05:29 - the commas and press ENTER once again
05:31 - and this time it will create these three
05:35 - directory so always remember when you
05:37 - give a space it will not create the you
05:41 - know correct directory structure you
05:44 - want so you need to give the comma
05:47 - without the space so this format of
05:51 - creating the multiple directory is
05:54 - correct without spaces and this will
05:57 - give you errors as we have seen it has
06:00 - created this directory which we did not
06:03 - want it ok so in this way you can use
06:07 - mkdir command in Linux I hope you've
