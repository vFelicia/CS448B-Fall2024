02:32 - need to have a Java JDK installed on
02:35 - your system
02:36 - and Java you can install it by going to
02:41 - the Oracle website so just search for
02:43 - Java JDK and the first link which will
02:47 - pop up here will be from Oracle comm and
02:50 - then some extension just click this link
02:53 - here and you will see Java here I will
02:57 - put the link in the description of the
03:00 - video which I have made to install Java
03:02 - JDK on your windows operating system so
03:05 - you can see it and see how we can
03:09 - install java jdk on our windows
03:11 - operating system including the
03:13 - environment variables ok so just click
03:16 - that link and then you can see how I
03:20 - have installed Java JDK once you have
03:23 - installed Java JDK and set up your
03:26 - environment variable for the other Java
03:28 - JDK then you can go to install Eclipse
03:32 - IDE now in order to download eclipse ID
03:37 - the simple thing is to do search for
03:40 - Eclipse download and the first link
03:43 - which will pop up here will be from
03:45 - eclipse Auto G slash downloads and go
03:50 - here and in here you will see variety of
03:53 - Eclipse IDE for developing Java for
03:58 - developing C++ PHP and other languages
04:02 - but what we want is Eclipse IDE for Java
04:05 - EE developers ok so we want this first
04:09 - link which says Java EE ok and if you
04:13 - read it carefully it says tool for Java
04:15 - developer creating Java EE and web
04:18 - applications we are going to develop web
04:21 - applications that's why we want to use
04:24 - this right now in
04:26 - in order to download it you need to know
04:28 - which operating system you have you have
04:32 - 64-bit operating system or 32-bit
04:34 - operating system in most of the cases
04:37 - you will be having 64-bit but just be
04:41 - sure which operating system you have I
04:43 - have 64 so I will click 64-bit operating
04:46 - system here and then you will see this
04:50 - download link for from the mirror which
04:53 - is closest to you mine is this mirror
04:57 - which is closest to my location or you
05:00 - can see other download links when you
05:04 - scroll down right and they even have
05:06 - some links which are faster for example
05:09 - IBM you can click this link and you will
05:13 - be able to download Eclipse IDE are
05:16 - really fast from these sites and in
05:20 - order to download it you just need to
05:22 - click download 64-bit right and click
05:27 - Save ok now it's relatively bigger file
05:32 - it's around 270 megabytes so you need to
05:36 - wait for a few minutes to download this
05:38 - file I have already downloaded this file
05:41 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
05:44 - go to this folder where I have
05:47 - downloaded this zip file so this will be
05:50 - a zip file with the extension zip you
05:54 - can see here in the properties right now
05:57 - you need to extract this so right click
06:00 - on it extract all and give the location
06:03 - where you want to extract this file ok
06:06 - so I'm going to give the location where
06:08 - I want to extract this which is inside
06:11 - this folder which I have created and I
06:13 - will click OK and I will click extract
06:16 - and this extraction also going to take
06:20 - some minutes because it's a big zip file
06:24 - right so this extraction is going to
06:27 - take few minutes in a meanwhile you can
06:30 - grab some coffee or some tea for you
06:34 - while it's extracting right
06:38 - so once your Eclipse zip folder is
06:40 - extracted it will look like this so
06:43 - there will be a clips folder and when
06:46 - you go inside this Eclipse folder you
06:47 - will be able to see all these files and
06:49 - what you need to do is you need to
06:51 - choose this Eclipse which has this
06:54 - Eclipse icon here and right click on it
06:57 - and you can see these option you can pin
07:01 - it to your taskbar this will pin this
07:03 - Eclipse to the taskbar and you can even
07:07 - make a shortcut for Eclipse and you can
07:10 - drag and drop this shortcut to your
07:13 - desktop here and then you can open
07:16 - Eclipse from here now double click on
07:19 - eclipse and for the first time when you
07:21 - open eclipse this is the common error if
07:24 - this error doesn't appear to you then
07:27 - it's really good but this is really
07:30 - common error which says JVM terminated
07:33 - exit code is equal to two and if you
07:37 - face this error then how to solve it you
07:42 - can solve it really easily so what you
07:45 - need to do is you just need to go to
07:48 - your search option and search for system
07:51 - here and in the system you just need to
07:55 - click advanced setting and in advanced
07:59 - setting go to environment variables and
08:01 - in environment variables go to path here
08:05 - okay and in the path you will be able to
08:09 - notice here that there is a wrong Java
08:14 - path which is by default added by
08:18 - Windows 8 I don't know how its added to
08:21 - this path variables you need to remove
08:24 - it right so it will look like this
08:28 - this path is something like C colon
08:30 - slash program data slash Oracle slash
08:34 - Java slash Java path you just need to
08:37 - remove this with semicolon okay so in my
08:41 - case it's at the first place I will
08:43 - remove it from here
08:45 - and make sure that the real Java path is
08:50 - already provided in your environment
08:53 - variable which is which will be
08:56 - something like C colon slash program
09:00 - file slash Java slash JDK slash bin and
09:04 - JRE slash bin okay and click OK and
09:09 - click OK and click OK and then once
09:13 - again when we run our Eclipse it will
09:18 - run ok so double click it and now it's
09:22 - running ok so this is the simple way of
09:25 - solving this problem now for the first
09:29 - time when a clip starts it will ask you
09:32 - for choosing your default workspace the
09:35 - workspace is nothing but the location
09:38 - where all your project will be saved
09:41 - ok and it will give you the default
09:44 - option also so just choose the default
09:47 - option from here and click OK now you
09:51 - will be able to see this kind of
09:53 - perspective in Eclipse so this is for
09:57 - the first time when you open your
09:58 - Eclipse IDE it'll look like this now
10:02 - creating your project you just need to
10:04 - go to here files and go to new and here
10:08 - you will be able to see so many options
10:11 - for creating projects right so let's
10:16 - create a quick project in Eclipse for
10:19 - developing HTML files so what you need
10:23 - to do is you just need to go here new
10:25 - and choose static web projects so just
10:29 - choose this static web project and in
10:32 - here give the name to your project for
10:34 - example my test project and you can
10:38 - click Next to see what are the other
10:41 - options this will be your content folder
10:45 - name and then click finish and click yes
10:49 - and once you click yes what you need to
10:52 - do is you just need to go here at the
10:55 - left-hand side and just below your file
10:58 - there will be
10:59 - a small button which says restore you
11:03 - just need to click this button here and
11:04 - then you will be able to see your
11:07 - project here ok and here you can see the
11:10 - welcome screen you can just resize it or
11:14 - you can just close it from here like
11:17 - this and then you can go to your project
11:21 - and in here you will be able to see this
11:23 - web content folder right now it's empty
11:26 - so you can right-click it and you can
11:30 - create a new HTML file so just go to new
11:34 - and then click HTML file option and give
11:39 - the name to your HTML file for example
11:42 - test dot HTML okay click Next and these
11:48 - are the default options and then click
11:50 - finish and it's going to create our HTML
11:54 - file with some default content for you
11:57 - right now in order to run this I will
12:01 - just quickly run this but I will
12:03 - describe all this code in the next video
12:07 - line by line let's run it once now to
12:11 - run this HTML file what you can do is
12:14 - you can go to your project once again
12:16 - and go to this web content folder and
12:19 - here is your test dot HTML file so you
12:22 - can right click on it and then you can
12:25 - just click open open width and click
12:29 - open with web browser okay and it's
12:32 - going to open your HTML file in the web
12:35 - browser which is in built in Eclipse
12:39 - okay and if you change some something
12:43 - here so this is my test file for example
12:51 - you write something save it so you to
12:55 - save it you just need to click this
12:56 - button and then once again when you are
12:59 - refresh this web browser page you will
13:03 - be able to see your message here right
13:07 - so right click on it open with and in
13:11 - web browser and you will be able to see
13:13 - your file in web browser ok so this is
13:18 - the output your of your HTML file so in
13:21 - this way you can install Eclipse IDE for
13:25 - developing your static HTML pages in
13:28 - Eclipse IDE and I hope you have enjoyed
