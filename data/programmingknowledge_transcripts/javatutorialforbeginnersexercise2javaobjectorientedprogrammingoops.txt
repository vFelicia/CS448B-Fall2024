00:00 - hello and welcome back to the new video
00:02 - the Java tutorial Series so this is the
00:05 - continuation continued video to the
00:07 - exercise that we have uh started started
00:10 - in our previous video uh so we have to
00:12 - solve the two problems Java intense one
00:15 - and Java and it takes two in our
00:16 - previous video so in this video we will
00:18 - be talking about uh abstract class Java
00:20 - in interface and Java method overriding
00:22 - problem okay so
00:26 - for the first problem in Java abstract
00:28 - class abstract class
00:30 - okay this is this is the formal
00:32 - definition of the abstract class you
00:34 - read it we have also done it in our
00:37 - previous video okay the following is an
00:38 - example of the abstract class so they
00:40 - have given one example for the abstract
00:42 - class okay and if you try to create an
00:45 - instance of this class like the
00:47 - following you will get an error
00:50 - okay okay
00:52 - now you have to create another class
00:55 - that extends abstract class then you can
00:57 - create the instance of the new class and
00:59 - notice that set title method is abstract
01:01 - 2 and has no body okay
01:04 - set title is abstract and has no body
01:06 - okay and that means you must Implement
01:10 - that body of the method inside the child
01:12 - class okay we have to implement this in
01:14 - the editor we have provided an abstract
01:16 - class book in main class in the main
01:19 - class we created an instance of the
01:21 - class called my book and your task is to
01:23 - just write the MacBook class okay
01:26 - uh sample input is a tail of the two
01:29 - cities and the sample output is a title
01:31 - is the tail of the two cities okay
01:33 - so I got some idea okay and let me get
01:38 - into my ID I will create a new class
01:41 - okay Java
01:46 - exercise
01:52 - problem three okay
01:54 - let me increase the font size I will put
01:58 - my main method
02:00 - now okay
02:03 - so they have created the abstract class
02:06 - book okay so we have to create one extra
02:08 - class book
02:10 - okay so abstract
02:13 - class
02:15 - book and inside that uh one string for
02:19 - holding the title of the book
02:23 - title and then
02:25 - one abstract method as they have said
02:28 - abstract void
02:30 - set title
02:33 - okay and
02:35 - once it accepting one string parameter
02:40 - yes okay upside class we have written
02:44 - and we will write one
02:48 - sorry string
02:52 - get
02:54 - title for receiving the title
02:57 - and inside this
02:59 - will simply write
03:02 - return
03:05 - sorry not Capital return date title okay
03:10 - so we are returning the title over here
03:13 - and wait a minute small typo is okay now
03:17 - it's okay uh we will write another class
03:19 - name as book
03:22 - so Plus
03:25 - notebook my book
03:31 - which extends this
03:34 - book class
03:40 - and inside this we have two
03:43 - give the implementation of the set title
03:45 - method so over here I will write
03:50 - public
03:51 - set
03:54 - title and I will
03:56 - pass the parameter as string
04:02 - title
04:05 - no K set title I am getting error
04:10 - we're gonna require type or must be
04:13 - declared after okay now we are
04:15 - implementing that okay the return time
04:18 - should be there now
04:20 - void set title okay now it's okay and
04:24 - this Dot
04:27 - title is equals to
04:30 - title
04:32 - okay this is about the set title method
04:36 - now inside my main method I will create
04:39 - the object of the my book class
04:43 - so P J it's equals to new
04:51 - obj might
04:55 - and I will call this method
05:00 - obj Dot
05:03 - set title and I will
05:06 - simply first receive the title from the
05:10 - user for that I have to declare one
05:13 - string variable t i t l e title
05:17 - initially it is empty string
05:20 - and after that
05:23 - I will receive the input from the user
05:25 - for receiving the input I have to create
05:27 - one
05:28 - object of the scanner class
05:31 - scanner SC is equals to new scanner
05:37 - steam dot in
05:40 - okay now
05:43 - I will set the title value to
05:49 - SC
05:51 - dot next
05:55 - now it's okay and I will pass that title
06:00 - to this method okay
06:02 - okay and uh
06:05 - what it's returning get title okay so we
06:08 - have to
06:10 - get this method also
06:14 - now to receive this method I will just
06:17 - simply copy this method and will print
06:20 - it over here
06:22 - get title and I will simply
06:25 - call one Sprint statement and inside
06:28 - this print statement I will write o b j
06:31 - Dot
06:32 - get title okay and before that I will
06:36 - concat it with one
06:40 - string
06:41 - that is
06:43 - the
06:45 - title of
06:48 - the book is
06:52 - this okay now if I run this
06:56 - first it will ask me for the title of
06:59 - the book okay so what they have given to
07:03 - us the title The Tale of the two cities
07:06 - I will simply copy it
07:08 - and I will paste it over here and enter
07:11 - a title of the book is a object wait a
07:16 - minute wait a minute
07:18 - am I missing over here
07:20 - the title of the book is a
07:24 - oh wait wait wait wait wait next
07:27 - next line it should be now if I
07:31 - run it again
07:34 - and I will give it the same now it's
07:36 - okay so the error was in this one if you
07:40 - write next it will get only the one word
07:43 - first word and whenever it receives the
07:46 - space it will just
07:48 - ignore that part to get that whole
07:51 - string uh you have to write a c dot next
07:53 - line okay so now you can see we are
07:56 - giving one input as a data of the
07:58 - notebook sorry notebook book and we are
08:01 - receiving the title of the book is a
08:03 - tale of the two cities okay so that is
08:06 - the part that we have to do okay right
08:10 - moving forward to the next one uh Java
08:13 - interfaces and
08:16 - okay so what they have given it's
08:20 - uh this is the overview of this uh
08:23 - whole problem now Java interface can
08:26 - contain only signature in the fields one
08:29 - okay so you read it I have read already
08:32 - you just pause the video and read it so
08:35 - what we have to do is
08:39 - here you can see you are given with the
08:40 - interface Advanced arithmetic which
08:42 - contains a method signature okay
08:44 - introducer sum and you need to write a
08:47 - class called my calculator which
08:49 - implements the interface okay we have to
08:51 - implement the interface and the divider
08:53 - sum function just takes an integer as an
08:55 - input and return the sum of all its
08:58 - divisor okay so so the divisor of six
09:02 - are one two three and six and the sum of
09:05 - the dividers are one plus two plus three
09:07 - plus six is equals to 12. so we have to
09:09 - return this okay and to do so
09:13 - we have given our
09:15 - here and did The partially completed
09:17 - code in the editor completed okay so let
09:21 - me create one class
09:25 - name as
09:34 - okay
09:37 - sorry for comment okay and I will import
09:41 - my main method
09:44 - I will get it over here and I have to
09:48 - write one
09:52 - this what we can say interface so I
09:56 - guess they have written interface
09:57 - already okay I will just copy this
09:59 - interface from here
10:02 - and I will paste it over here okay
10:05 - [Music]
10:06 - okay wait I is not getting it now it's
10:09 - okay uh let me format it
10:20 - so over here I have copied this
10:23 - interface so from here and now uh inside
10:27 - my arithmetic Advanced arithmetics class
10:30 - I need to
10:33 - Implement I guess that one okay
10:36 - so I will write
10:39 - public
10:42 - int
10:44 - let me just copy
10:47 - this part
10:49 - name of the method
10:52 - which accepting the parameter of integer
10:54 - n and inside this I will write int I
10:58 - need one variable known as sum
11:01 - 0 I will initialize with and I will
11:04 - insert my for Loop and it will start
11:06 - from int and D is equals to 1
11:10 - whenever D is less than n and each time
11:13 - I will be doing D plus plus
11:17 - okay and set this for Loop here I will
11:19 - check if that n in mod
11:24 - d
11:25 - equals equals to zero if it's so
11:29 - sum is equals to
11:31 - some plus is equals to D
11:34 - okay and after that after running the
11:38 - for Loop I will just simply return
11:42 - this sum
11:45 - okay uh so this is pretty much that we
11:49 - have to
11:51 - okay okay wait wait wait wait wait why
11:54 - it's throwing the error
11:56 - let me check okay uh class Advantage
11:58 - arithmetics is public and should be
12:00 - declared inside the advanced arithmetics
12:03 - dot Java okay okay wait
12:06 - I know the error
12:10 - now it's okay the file name and the
12:12 - class name is different that's why the
12:14 - IntelliJ IDEA is showing the errors okay
12:16 - and inside the main method uh I will
12:19 - just create
12:21 - the object of this class
12:27 - and using that object
12:30 - I will just call divider sum and it will
12:34 - pass the same value that they have given
12:37 - okay so they have given 6 as an input so
12:40 - let me give it as so 6 as a input and I
12:44 - will pass it and this method is
12:46 - returning the sum so I have to write
12:50 - this whole thing inside one print
12:53 - statement so that
12:54 - the return value can be printed on the
12:58 - console okay so if I right click and
13:01 - click on run
13:03 - the 12 should be getting yeah 12 12 is
13:06 - printing on the console so this problem
13:08 - is also
13:10 - done okay so
13:13 - I hope you you can solve this remaining
13:16 - problems uh if I I can solve also so I
13:21 - want you to solve let's give it a try
13:23 - try to solve this uh questions uh check
13:26 - out the discussion forum if you got
13:28 - stuck anywhere in between uh check out
13:30 - the leaderboard submissions your
13:33 - previous submission should become here
13:34 - any edit editorial will be open uh
13:38 - one don't open the editorial you will
13:40 - see the answer directly uh first try to
13:43 - answer these questions try to get the
13:46 - solution
13:47 - and I hope you enjoyed this exercise and
13:50 - thank you for watching this video and
13:52 - I'll see you in the next one
