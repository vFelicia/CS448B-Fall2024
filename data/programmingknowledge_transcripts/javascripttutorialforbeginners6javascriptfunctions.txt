00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:01 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:03 - this video we will discuss about using
00:06 - functions in JavaScript so first of all
00:10 - what is a function a function is a block
00:14 - of code which performs some particular
00:17 - task and why do we use it we use
00:20 - functions to reuse our code because it's
00:24 - doing some function and if we want to
00:28 - apply this particular task again and
00:32 - again in our code then functions is the
00:36 - most beneficial thing to do so let's see
00:39 - how we can use functions in JavaScript
00:42 - so first of all what I'm going to do is
00:44 - I'm going to add the script tag inside
00:47 - my body just keep in mind that you need
00:50 - to add the script tag inside your body
00:53 - element okay and in here first of all
00:56 - let's see how functions prototype looks
01:00 - like so this is how you declare a
01:03 - function you need to use a keyword
01:06 - called function and then you give the
01:09 - function name and then in these brackets
01:12 - you can provide some parameter they can
01:16 - be none or they can be one or two or
01:20 - many parameter you can provide any
01:23 - number of parameters in a function like
01:27 - this and inside the curly braces comes
01:31 - the body of the function okay so let's
01:35 - apply this logic to create a function
01:38 - inside our JavaScript element or script
01:41 - element so this is the function keyword
01:45 - and then comes your function name so for
01:50 - example we want to print something so I
01:53 - can just write print message it's the
01:57 - name of the function and for example I
02:00 - don't want to give any arguments so it's
02:02 - taking no argument from here and by
02:05 - using this function what I want to do is
02:07 - for example I want to print some message
02:09 - when I call this function okay so
02:13 - create our h1 element here and in here
02:19 - what I want to do is I want to add an
02:22 - attribute which is called ID and I can
02:26 - name my ID anything for example demo ok
02:29 - and now there is a function in
02:33 - JavaScript which is an inbuilt function
02:35 - which is document then there is function
02:40 - called get element by ID and what it
02:45 - does is it takes the element by ID so
02:47 - our element is h1 here and the ID is
02:51 - demo right so we need to give here the
02:54 - ID of our element which we need to
02:58 - affect from this function ok and then
03:01 - there is a function one more function
03:04 - which we can call here which is called
03:06 - inner HTML ok is equal to and then I can
03:13 - give any message or anything to this
03:19 - element using this assignment operator
03:24 - so for example I can just write hello
03:27 - and then there is a term called that
03:29 - calling a function so once you create a
03:32 - function you also need to call it and
03:35 - how you call it for example I created
03:37 - this function and I just want to call it
03:39 - just below this function declaration
03:42 - here so just write the name of the
03:45 - function and those brackets here and
03:47 - then give this semicolon and save your
03:51 - code and refresh your web page and it
03:54 - will give you your message using this h1
03:58 - tag ok so this is how a function will
04:02 - work now I told you that function can
04:05 - take some parameters here so for example
04:09 - I create a second function which I named
04:14 - it as ad here and what it does is it
04:19 - takes two parameter for example num1 and
04:23 - num2 ok
04:27 - these parameter names are given by the
04:30 - user so it can be anything X or Y or
04:33 - number one or number two or number one
04:35 - or number two it's on new what parameter
04:38 - name you want to give here okay and
04:41 - instead of printing anything here I will
04:46 - just return from this function right so
04:50 - what I am going to return just use a
04:52 - keyword called return and then for
04:56 - example I want to return the addition of
04:59 - these two numbers so just write num1
05:01 - plus num2 okay and what it's going to do
05:06 - is whatever parameter you give here it
05:09 - takes these two parameters and add these
05:12 - two numbers which you give here and
05:15 - returns the addition using this function
05:18 - okay so let's see how we can use it so
05:22 - I'm going to use this document dot get
05:24 - element ID something like this and after
05:28 - this print message call I can call this
05:31 - here document dot get element ID and for
05:35 - example I'm going to add one more header
05:38 - element here and in here I'm going to
05:40 - give the name to my ID for the second h1
05:44 - tag for example some okay so this is the
05:48 - ID of my h1 element and I can pass this
05:51 - some ID here and instead of using hello
05:56 - world here I can directly call this
05:59 - function which is add and I can passed
06:03 - two numbers here for example 100 and 200
06:08 - okay because it's taking two numbers
06:11 - here right so save your code and refresh
06:14 - your webpage and now it gives you hello
06:18 - world which is from our first function
06:20 - and it's gives you the addition of two
06:23 - numbers which is 100 plus 200 which is
06:25 - 300 right now remember I told you that
06:29 - by using function it makes you easy to
06:32 - perform a particular task again and
06:35 - again okay
06:37 - so in here we are adding 100 and 200
06:40 - but for example I want to add some other
06:43 - numbers so I create one more h1 element
06:47 - and the ID name I change it to someone
06:51 - and here also I replace it by someone
06:53 - and here I want to add for example
06:56 - thousand and two thousand okay and save
07:02 - your code and refresh it and it gives
07:05 - you thousand plus two thousand which is
07:07 - three thousand here okay
07:08 - so notice here we are using the same
07:12 - function but we are passing different
07:15 - parameters here right so we are reusing
07:18 - our code in a way okay so whenever you
07:22 - want to reuse your code you may want to
07:25 - consider function now for example I have
07:28 - two strings so you can concatenate two
07:31 - strings using this plus operator right
07:35 - so for example I have two strings like
07:37 - hello world and save your code and
07:40 - refresh your web page it will give you
07:43 - hello world right so you are using the
07:45 - same function to concatenate two string
07:48 - using a function so in this way you can
07:51 - use functions in JavaScript so once
07:55 - again I'm going to repeat the terms we
07:58 - have used one is the function keyword
08:02 - whenever you declare a function use
08:04 - function keyword then a name then these
08:07 - are called parameters here this is
08:09 - called the body which you write inside
08:12 - these curly braces you can return the
08:15 - result by using this keyword called
08:18 - return and then return your result now
08:21 - whenever you want to execute this
08:24 - function
08:25 - it's called calling a function right so
08:28 - you're calling this add a function here
08:31 - and whenever you give some real values
08:33 - as a parameter they are called arguments
08:36 - okay so that's it for functions in
08:39 - JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this
