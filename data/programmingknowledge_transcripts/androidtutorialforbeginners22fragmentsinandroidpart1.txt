00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - what are fragments in Android and how we
00:10 - can use fragments and we will also see
00:13 - an example how to use fragments so that
00:16 - we can understand it in a better way so
00:20 - first of all what is a fragment a fact
00:24 - fragment represents a behavior or a
00:28 - portion of user interface in an activity
00:32 - that means we use fragment inside an
00:37 - Android activity and you can combine
00:41 - multiple fragments in a single activity
00:44 - to build a multi-pane user interface and
00:48 - you can reuse a fragment in multiple
00:52 - activities so I will show you a picture
00:56 - which will you know give a demonstration
01:00 - how a fragment can work but let's see
01:04 - what is a an exact you know advantage of
01:09 - fragment so the greatest advantage of
01:13 - fragment is that it simplifies the task
01:16 - of creating UIs for multiple screen
01:20 - sizes and our activity can contain
01:25 - number of fragments okay so let me give
01:30 - you an example so that you can
01:33 - understand it in a better way this
01:36 - picture I have taken from Android comm
01:40 - so you can also see this picture and in
01:43 - here you can see this fragment example
01:47 - for tablet and handset okay and in here
01:52 - you can see in the tablet example 2
01:57 - fragments fragment a and fragment B
02:00 - because tablet screen is bigger so you
02:04 - can you know adjust or you can insert
02:08 - two fragments inside a one activity here
02:13 - okay so this is a tablet screen and
02:17 - which contains an activity and inside
02:21 - here there are two fragment one fragment
02:25 - is this one this block which is screen
02:27 - here another fragment is this one and
02:30 - this is something like whenever you
02:34 - click a button you will be able to see
02:36 - the corresponding screen related to the
02:40 - button action right so you when you
02:43 - click some button for some image for
02:47 - example some landscape image you click
02:49 - landscape button you will be able to see
02:52 - landscape image or some person's image
02:55 - or some country or regions image when
02:59 - you click them right so in this tablet
03:02 - example there are two fragment inside
03:05 - our activity and whenever you you know
03:11 - click these buttons one fragment you
03:14 - will be able to see the corresponding
03:16 - response in other fragment in the same
03:20 - way in because handsets screen are small
03:24 - so here you have activity a and fragment
03:27 - a inside this activity and flag activity
03:31 - V B which contains fragment B so
03:34 - whenever you click some button in
03:37 - fragment in in activity a you will be
03:41 - able to see this activity V inside this
03:46 - fragment or active fragment B inside
03:49 - this activity right so the basic idea is
03:53 - the reusability of your code because you
03:58 - can use multiple fragments so you can
04:02 - create a fragment and reuse it in
04:05 - multiple activities and basically if you
04:09 - make fragments it will you know reduce
04:12 - your code writing and you know you will
04:16 - be you know able to write a really good
04:19 - code now let's take an example
04:23 - so what I am going to do is I'm going to
04:27 - create a new project for this fragment
04:34 - example and in here I will name my
04:37 - project as fragment example and in here
04:45 - we'll choose the default us you know
04:49 - minimum SDK and in here note that we can
04:55 - use fragment above API 11 so it's better
05:00 - to use API 11 or above to use fragment
05:05 - in a better way so I will use API 11 or
05:08 - Android 3.0 which is hunting comp and
05:12 - then I will click Next and I will create
05:16 - a blanket activity click Next and I will
05:21 - leave them as default and click finish
05:29 - so now our blank project is created and
05:34 - we can see this hollow world textview
05:37 - here I'm going to delete it and what I'm
05:41 - going to do is I'm going to go to my
05:43 - text view of this activity main.xml file
05:47 - and instead of relative layout we are
05:52 - going to use linear layout here so what
05:55 - I'm going to do is I'm going to just
05:57 - change this lil relative layout to
06:00 - linear layout okay now when you change
06:07 - this layout here from relative layout to
06:12 - linear layout you will be able to see a
06:15 - error here and this thing's nothing but
06:21 - you know whenever you add some child to
06:25 - your activity or then this error can
06:29 - occur so for fixing this error what you
06:34 - need to do is you just need to go to the
06:36 - property here and in here go to the
06:39 - property called orientation and change
06:41 - the orientation to vertical and this
06:45 - error will be gone okay because our
06:49 - layout is linear okay now what we are
06:53 - going to do is we are going to take two
06:55 - buttons and we are going to you know
07:04 - listen for this button click events and
07:07 - we will try to open two different
07:10 - fragments using these two buttons okay
07:14 - so I will name the rename these buttons
07:19 - as for example fragment one and the
07:27 - second button I will a name as
07:33 - fragment to okay and I will just change
07:37 - the property layout with property of
07:40 - these two fragments to fill or match
07:44 - parent okay so they cover the whole
07:47 - width now what I'm going to do is I'm
07:51 - going to add some fragment to our
07:54 - project so go to your app folder and
07:59 - inside this app folder go to resource
08:01 - directory and inside this go to this
08:04 - layout folder where your activity
08:07 - underscore main dot XML file is there
08:10 - now just click this layout folder and
08:14 - right-click it and create new and we are
08:18 - going to create a new fragment which is
08:20 - a blank fragment and we will name this
08:24 - fragment as for example fragment one
08:29 - okay
08:30 - fragment 1 or fragment one like this and
08:35 - I will click finish in a same way I will
08:39 - once again add a second fragment so I
08:42 - will right click on layout new fragment
08:45 - blank fragment and I will name it as
08:48 - fragment to okay fragment - so this will
08:58 - create two fragments for us this
09:01 - fragment is the fragment number two and
09:04 - this fragment is fragment number one
09:06 - okay
09:07 - now let's change the background color of
09:11 - these two fragments so that we can
09:13 - recognize the fragments so for example
09:17 - this fragment I will just change the
09:21 - background color to a little bit reddish
09:24 - let's see what color we can choose for
09:27 - fragment one for example green okay so
09:31 - that we can recognize these two
09:33 - fragments okay now what I am going to do
09:36 - is here you will be able to see inside
09:39 - your Java folder there are two Java file
09:42 - will be created for fragment one and
09:44 - fragment
09:45 - that our fragment one dot Java I am
09:49 - going to click this fragment one dot
09:51 - Java file and in here you will be able
09:54 - to see this all code is created for you
09:57 - by you know Android studio for you ok so
10:03 - what I'm going to do is to make things
10:05 - simple I will just remove all the code
10:09 - and I will just leave one method here
10:13 - and this method will be on create view
10:18 - method and all the other method methods
10:21 - I will delete okay so there is only one
10:26 - method I am going to leave which is on
10:29 - create and we will do the same for
10:34 - fragment two also so we will click
10:37 - fragment to the Java file and we will
10:39 - delete all the code other than on create
10:43 - view method so delete all the code
10:48 - inside this class and just leave this on
10:52 - create view method okay now what I'm
10:58 - going to do is I am going to once again
11:00 - go to my activity underscore main dot
11:03 - XML file and I will try to add this
11:07 - fragment in this remaining space okay
11:11 - so I will go to text and in here I am
11:15 - going to add this fragment so just add a
11:19 - fragment and this will create a fragment
11:24 - for you and you can choose which width
11:28 - and layout height you want so I want to
11:32 - add match parent for the height and
11:41 - width okay now you can add some more
11:45 - properties to this this fragment like ID
11:50 - so I'm going to add some ID in order to
11:55 - save time I will just copy and paste
11:57 - this
11:58 - and ID for example we will name a
12:03 - fragment place for example ok now you
12:11 - can also add the default fragment here
12:14 - so that whenever we will run our
12:17 - activity some default fragment should be
12:21 - set inside this fragment ok so what we
12:26 - are going to do we are going to add a
12:29 - default fragment to it so just write
12:33 - android android name and we will add a
12:41 - default fragment here so inside this
12:43 - these double quotes go to your fragment
12:47 - 1 dot XML file in here and just copy the
12:54 - name of this fragment from here or
12:57 - context comm dot example dot whatever is
13:01 - the name of your fragment so just copy
13:03 - this from here and go to your activity
13:07 - underscore main dot XML file and paste
13:11 - it under Android colon name ok now this
13:16 - will create a fragment in your in your
13:22 - activity now we are almost done with our
13:28 - design and what we want to do is we just
13:32 - want to write the code so that whenever
13:34 - we click a button a fragment related to
13:39 - that button will be displayed in this
13:43 - fragment area okay so there is a
13:48 - abstract class called fragment manager
13:51 - we use to you know a work with fragments
13:57 - so this fragment class was fragment
14:01 - manager class or what is this so to
14:05 - manage fragments we need a fragment
14:08 - manager this is an abstract class
14:11 - Android that helped us to handle
14:14 - transaction between fragments okay and
14:18 - we also are going to use a fragment
14:23 - transaction class and these transaction
14:27 - or with with transaction we mean a
14:30 - sequence of steps like add replace or
14:35 - remove fragments okay
14:38 - so let's add some code to our main
14:43 - activity dot Java file
14:52 - you
