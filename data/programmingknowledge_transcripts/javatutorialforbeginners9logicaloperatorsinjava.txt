00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:07 - how to use if statement in Java and we
00:11 - have also seen how we can use relational
00:15 - operator inside our if condition now in
00:19 - this video we will see how we can use
00:22 - logical operators in or with our if
00:27 - statement so what are logical operators
00:31 - first of all so for example uh you want
00:35 - to evaluate more than one conditions uh
00:40 - using a single if
00:42 - statement how you can do it you can uh
00:46 - not simply do it like for example I want
00:50 - uh to check uh the scores of the student
00:53 - in some uh particular subject so in
00:57 - subject one a particular student scores
00:59 - 40
01:00 - and subject to a particular student the
01:03 - same student scores 60 marks and I want
01:07 - to check whether these uh two conditions
01:11 - are true or not so I want to check if uh
01:15 - the subject one
01:17 - marks is uh greater than or equal to
01:24 - 35 and I want to also check if he has
01:28 - passed in second subject so I want to
01:30 - check similar kind of condition with the
01:33 - second subject now using logical
01:38 - operators you can check multiple
01:41 - conditions inside single if statement so
01:45 - how you can do it first of all there are
01:48 - two kind or Third Kind is also possible
01:52 - but most Basics are two uh kinds of
01:57 - logical operators first is
02:00 - uh end operator so these double m per
02:05 - shows the end
02:08 - operator and second type of operator is
02:13 - called or operator okay so second type
02:17 - is double pipe and this is called R
02:22 - operator or okay and this should be and
02:28 - operator I can make it
02:32 - bold Now using and operator as the name
02:35 - suggest it checks two condition wherever
02:40 - it's used for example we use this end
02:43 - operator we can uh Define two conditions
02:48 - so one first condition is this one which
02:51 - is subject one marks should be greater
02:54 - than or equal to
02:56 - 35 and let's uh put them inside the
03:01 - bracket so there will be no confusion
03:03 - and the second condition we want to
03:05 - check that subject two Mark should also
03:09 - be greater than or equal to 35 right
03:16 - so using this and operator we are
03:19 - checking both the condition so and
03:22 - operator whenever you use you check
03:25 - first condition and the second condition
03:29 - right
03:31 - so whenever you run the
03:34 - program it checks both the condition so
03:38 - it says the condition is true okay we
03:42 - can also add else
03:44 - statements else and we can just write
03:49 - the condition is false if this is not
03:52 - true right so
03:56 - here false so for example example I want
04:01 - to check or I will uh change the value
04:05 - of subject one for example 20 right now
04:09 - the subject one value is not greater
04:13 - than 35 but the second condition is true
04:16 - subject two value which is 60 is greater
04:18 - than 35 so only one condition is true in
04:22 - this case and the other is not true
04:25 - right so let's try to run the program
04:29 - and it says the condition is false so
04:31 - the end operator evaluates all the
04:36 - condition in the if statement this and
04:39 - this right and in the same way you can
04:42 - add multiple and operators like this so
04:48 - you can just need you just need to add
04:50 - this end and you can evaluate this
04:53 - condition then and other condition then
04:57 - and other condition right so in this way
05:00 - you can evaluate multiple conditions
05:03 - using this and
05:05 - operator now or operator is as the name
05:09 - suggest is it checks for either one of
05:14 - the condition should be true so either
05:17 - this should be true or this should be
05:19 - true so at least one condition is true
05:22 - then it'll execute the statement in the
05:25 - if statement for example right now this
05:28 - condition in our case is true because uh
05:31 - subject 2 has 60 60 is greater than 35
05:34 - this condition is true but this
05:36 - condition is false because subject 1 is
05:38 - equal to 20 which is not greater than 35
05:41 - so only one condition is true in this
05:43 - case and when we run the program it
05:47 - says why it says because yeah we need to
05:50 - add this R operator here right once
05:54 - again run the
05:56 - program and it says the condition is
05:58 - true right right so this R
06:01 - operator checks only one condition or
06:05 - checks for both the condition and if
06:08 - only one condition is true also it will
06:12 - just uh execute your statement side your
06:16 - if statement so
06:18 - or means just checking either I mean if
06:23 - this or this is true it will uh execute
06:27 - the statement but in end statement or
06:29 - all conditions should be true this and
06:32 - this
06:34 - right this is the basic difference uh in
06:39 - and operator and or operator now for
06:43 - example I have both the condition false
06:45 - for example this is 25 so student one is
06:50 - also not passed and student two is also
06:53 - not passed because both are below 32
06:57 - then the
07:00 - condition is false in this case so using
07:04 - R operator we are checking even one
07:07 - condition is true then it will print
07:09 - this but in this case both condition are
07:12 - false that's why it's printing this
07:15 - one so in this CA in this uh way you can
07:19 - use logical operator with if statements
07:23 - so I hope you have enjoyed the video
