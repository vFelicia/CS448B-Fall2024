00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we are going to see how to use for
00:07 - loops in Python so first of all what are
00:10 - for loops so a for loop is used to
00:14 - iterate over a sequence and that
00:17 - sequence can be a list or a tuple or a
00:20 - dictionary or a set or a string so for
00:24 - that I'm going to declare some variables
00:26 - and the first variable is a which is a
00:30 - list second variable is B which is a
00:32 - tuple third is C which is a set fourth
00:36 - is a string and fifth variable is e
00:40 - which is a dictionary now before seeing
00:43 - the syntax of for loop I'm going to show
00:46 - you how to use in operator in Python
00:49 - because it's used in for loop so I'm
00:53 - going to first of all use print and then
00:56 - I'm going to use 0 and then use in
01:00 - operator and then I'm going to use this
01:02 - first variable which is a which is a
01:05 - list right and let's see what happens
01:07 - when I try to run this code so it prints
01:10 - true so in operator will give you true
01:14 - or false depending upon whether this
01:17 - value is present in your sequence or not
01:21 - so for example when I write hundred here
01:24 - which is not present in the list it's
01:26 - going to return us false so this you can
01:28 - use with the couple also let me just use
01:32 - it with tupple and let's use one here
01:36 - and I'm going to run the program it
01:38 - prints true once again
01:42 - also we can use in operator with strings
01:45 - so I can write D here but for that I
01:49 - need to convert this one into a string
01:52 - so now when I run the code it will give
01:55 - me true now let's see how to use a for a
01:58 - loop
01:59 - in Python so for loop as I said we can
02:02 - use with some sequence so let's use it
02:05 - with a which is a list so I can write x
02:09 - in a and a is a list in this case and
02:14 - then I can just print the value of x and
02:18 - let's see what happens first of all when
02:21 - we just write this kind of a for loop so
02:25 - we are going to run the program and what
02:27 - it does is it prints the values from 0
02:30 - to 5 which is the element present inside
02:34 - the list so for loop is going to iterate
02:37 - over your list one by one and this in
02:40 - operator is going to check whether this
02:43 - value is there in your sequence or not
02:46 - in this case in our list or not so first
02:49 - of all when for loop start it will
02:51 - transfer the first value which is 0 into
02:54 - X and then it checks whether X is in
02:58 - this list or not and then it's going to
03:01 - print the value of x which is 0 and once
03:03 - again programs sequence schools here and
03:06 - once again the next value is transferred
03:08 - to X which is 1 and once again this
03:11 - condition is validated if one is in this
03:14 - list a or not and then the value of x is
03:18 - printed which is 1 and this iteration
03:20 - goes on and on until 5 is reached which
03:23 - is the last value in the list so 5 is
03:26 - printed and after that there is nothing
03:28 - inside X and then the program flow comes
03:30 - out of this loop you can also use this
03:33 - for loop with the couple also so let's
03:36 - try it with couple and let's see what
03:38 - happens it's going to print the same
03:40 - values also with the set let's see what
03:45 - happens so I'm going to run the program
03:46 - once again and it prints 0 to 5 once
03:49 - again because these are the content of
03:51 - the set also once again let's try to use
03:55 - the
03:55 - for loop with the string and let's see
03:58 - what happens and it's going to print out
04:00 - the content of this string which is 0 1
04:04 - 2 3 4 5 and it prints them one by one
04:08 - now with the dictionary we use this for
04:11 - loop in a little bit different way so
04:13 - for example I will write the variable
04:16 - name which is a dictionary and then
04:18 - let's say I want to just print all the
04:21 - keys inside this dictionary then I can
04:24 - write e dot keys and then we have all
04:27 - the keys using this function and when I
04:30 - run the code it's going to print all the
04:32 - keys inside your dictionary also when
04:36 - you use the function called dot values
04:39 - it's going to print out all the values
04:42 - inside your dictionary you can see max
04:44 - and the age 20 now let's say you want to
04:47 - print out all the key value pairs which
04:50 - are there in your dictionary you can use
04:53 - a function called items and this is
04:56 - going to give you keys and values right
04:58 - so I can just write key comma value here
05:03 - and then I can print the value of key
05:05 - first of all key and let's provide some
05:08 - space here and then let's print out the
05:11 - variable value here okay and when I run
05:14 - the code it's going to give you first of
05:17 - all key and then the value once again
05:20 - key and then the value so in order to
05:23 - print out the keys and values from a
05:25 - dictionary you can use this kind of
05:27 - notation now you can also use a function
05:30 - called range so let me show you how to
05:32 - use this function which is range which
05:35 - returns us the values starting from 0 so
05:38 - there is a function called range here
05:41 - and in here you can provide a number and
05:44 - this range is going to return the number
05:48 - starting from 0 to 5 so whatever number
05:51 - you write here the range ray will be
05:53 - returned from 0 until that number except
05:57 - whatever number you write here ok so let
06:00 - me just try to print out the values
06:02 - which is there in the X and when I try
06:05 - to print this it's going to return me
06:07 - from 0
06:09 - - five and you can see here six is not
06:11 - printed because the range will give us
06:14 - the value except that value which you
06:16 - write here you can also provide the
06:18 - start value here so let's say I want to
06:20 - start from two and I want to go until
06:23 - five I can write something like this and
06:26 - now you can see now it will start
06:28 - printing from two to five also you can
06:31 - give a third parameter here which is a
06:33 - step parameter so I can give three here
06:36 - for example and let's say I want to
06:39 - write thirty here and let's run the code
06:42 - and now what is going to return is it
06:45 - starts from two because we have given
06:48 - the start value to here and it's going
06:51 - to go on till twenty nine because we
06:53 - have given 30 value here right and this
06:56 - is the step so every third value will be
07:00 - printed after two here so five will be
07:02 - printed then eight then 11 14 17 20 23
07:07 - 26 and 29 every third value right if you
07:11 - write here 2 then we will increment in
07:15 - the step of 2 so this is how you can use
07:18 - range function with your for loop also
07:21 - as I said in the last video you can use
07:24 - else statement with your loops so I can
07:28 - also write else here and then after the
07:32 - colon in the next line I can print
07:34 - something or I can execute some
07:36 - statement so for now I will just print
07:39 - finished and then I'm going to run the
07:43 - code and once the loop is finished you
07:45 - can see this else statement is executed
07:48 - which prints finished so else statement
07:51 - will be executed once your for loop is
07:54 - finished so in this way you can use for
07:56 - loops in Python I hope you've enjoyed
07:58 - this video and I will see you in the
08:00 - next video
