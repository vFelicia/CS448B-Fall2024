00:00 - in this video we'll talk about the top
00:02 - websites which you can use to practice
00:04 - your interview skills
00:05 - to get your first software engineering
00:07 - job being a backend or a front-end
00:09 - job now this video will only deal with
00:13 - the technical aspect of
00:14 - the interview pipeline uh it will not
00:17 - deal with the behavioral interviews or
00:18 - the culture
00:19 - interviews there will be another video
00:22 - which deals with
00:23 - that those aspects of an interview
00:24 - pipeline this particular one will only
00:26 - talk about the technical aspects which
00:28 - can help you to
00:29 - get your next software engineering job
00:32 - most of the information that i provide
00:35 - or recommend in this video will only
00:37 - apply to entry level
00:39 - software engineering jobs for students
00:42 - who are
00:42 - who are just going outside of graduating
00:44 - college and having a hard time
00:46 - finding a job all thanks to covered but
00:50 - i'll try my best to sum up all the
00:52 - resources that
00:53 - you can use to practice or learn for
00:56 - your next
00:57 - job and if you would like some help with
01:00 - your
01:01 - resumes then you can email me the my
01:03 - email is in the description below and i
01:04 - can help you
01:06 - with your resume writing a cover letter
01:08 - and those initial steps which
01:11 - are a make or break for your resume
01:13 - screening or for interview step
01:16 - so let's get started here i'll be
01:18 - talking about eight
01:19 - websites and one book which you can
01:22 - refer to
01:23 - you don't have to go through all the
01:26 - websites
01:26 - all you can do is choose one and you
01:29 - know just work with that
01:30 - or you can try all choose one you can
01:34 - basically mix it up so it's completely
01:36 - up to you how you want to use the
01:37 - resources
01:38 - all i can do is tell you what each
01:40 - resource does and
01:41 - uh whether how it will actually help you
01:44 - find a job
01:45 - so the first thing which uh we talk
01:48 - about is lead code
01:49 - so you probably might be already doing
01:51 - lead code or
01:53 - solving problems or it could so this is
01:55 - basically a website or a platform which
01:57 - helps you participate in contests
01:58 - practice
01:59 - algorithmic problems database and os
02:01 - questions and it has
02:03 - everything that you need to crack your
02:06 - next
02:06 - technical interview so i would say that
02:08 - if you just stick to lead code and
02:10 - uh forget about everything else that
02:12 - should be more than enough
02:13 - but we'll also look at some other
02:16 - websites which can help in different
02:17 - ways so
02:18 - lead code is on my top list where you
02:21 - can explore by topics you can learn a
02:23 - particular topic
02:24 - which you feel like so if you feel that
02:26 - you are weak in binary search you can
02:28 - just go inside the binary search
02:29 - explorer card and
02:30 - do that if you feel your uh weekend
02:33 - recursion regardless of one and two
02:35 - and i think the free uh subscription for
02:39 - lead code is more than enough for your
02:40 - next interview you just have to be
02:42 - disciplined and you need to do
02:43 - deliberate practice so this would be my
02:45 - top choice when you
02:47 - want to make sure that you're preparing
02:51 - well for your next upcoming interview
02:53 - but uh this will help you
02:56 - mainly when you have an interview ready
02:58 - and you have to prepare for it so this
03:00 - can be marked as both for
03:01 - long term learning and for short-term
03:04 - preparations as well
03:06 - now the next website is hack rank so
03:08 - hacker rank back in the days was only
03:10 - about
03:11 - basic puzzles and contests but now they
03:13 - have actually
03:14 - expanded into multiple domains
03:16 - certifications competing jobs
03:18 - all of that so i would say that if you
03:20 - are a beginner in
03:22 - uh who just got into college and
03:23 - starting his computer science degree
03:25 - then
03:25 - you can just look around hacker rank and
03:27 - see what they offer so they have basic
03:29 - problem solving skills
03:31 - api so they also teach you software
03:32 - engineering concepts uh
03:34 - for example rest apis and you also have
03:36 - mock tests
03:37 - all of that so there they have tried to
03:40 - make it
03:41 - very easy for you to understand the
03:42 - basics of computer science
03:44 - at least in terms of what a job requires
03:48 - with certifications so i would not uh
03:51 - say that you should completely depend on
03:52 - these certifications because
03:54 - in the end certificates don't matter
03:55 - when it comes to job
03:57 - that is my opinion but you can
03:59 - definitely go around and see how
04:02 - you can use these to help yourself get
04:04 - better at what you want to do
04:06 - so if you think you want to uh make sure
04:08 - that your functional programming skills
04:10 - are good or you want to practice then
04:11 - you can go on
04:12 - this part and do it and yeah choose by
04:14 - topic
04:15 - so i would recommend this for any
04:17 - college student who would like to you
04:19 - know
04:19 - build up the skills uh so next is
04:22 - educative so this is a
04:23 - a relatively new website which helps you
04:27 - understand uh concepts and interviews
04:30 - all of that
04:31 - so this particularly is paid only or it
04:34 - has some three courses but
04:36 - the paid ones are really really good uh
04:38 - from what i've seen
04:39 - but uh the main uh thing which i really
04:43 - like about educative is that
04:45 - they use uh both videos and uh
04:48 - text based courses where you can learn
04:51 - at a higher
04:51 - pace and you can also see what they're
04:54 - teaching you can also see
04:56 - uh what they're doing how to how to
04:57 - actually work with the problem
04:59 - and the people who teach are really good
05:01 - and really
05:02 - educated so i think this should be a go
05:05 - to if you
05:06 - can afford uh the pricing which they
05:08 - have i think it's pretty
05:11 - um kind of costly but uh if you would
05:14 - like to go for it then i think it's the
05:15 - best
05:16 - thing for uh your short-term interview
05:18 - preparations
05:19 - uh let's say you're jumping rolls you're
05:22 - trying to negotiate a few roles so i
05:24 - think educative would be a really great
05:25 - idea to prepare for your technical
05:27 - interviews
05:28 - next is a new thing called as
05:30 - interviewing.io so
05:31 - uh you probably might have seen their
05:33 - youtube videos where they conduct more
05:35 - interviews between two people
05:36 - and one being from a very nice fan job
05:39 - and the other was preparing for it
05:41 - so this is basically only for mock
05:43 - interviews and uh which can potentially
05:45 - lead to
05:46 - real interviews with these companies so
05:49 - a pretty simple way of how it works and
05:52 - they are really good at what they say so
05:54 - you can have really intensive practice
05:57 - and i think doing even like five or ten
06:00 - of these
06:00 - uh in a year should be more than enough
06:03 - to make sure that your skills are up to
06:05 - date
06:05 - and i would highly highly recommend this
06:07 - for anybody who would like to
06:09 - uh you know do mock interviews and mock
06:12 - interviews are a very very very good way
06:14 - to
06:14 - uh prepare for your upcoming interviews
06:16 - because you will be
06:18 - in the interview setting and you will be
06:19 - forced to think
06:21 - uh in pressure and i think that is one
06:24 - of the most important
06:25 - uh points when it comes to interviewing
06:28 - so check it out
06:29 - uh all the links for these websites will
06:30 - be in the description below and also if
06:32 - you would like to uh
06:34 - have get some help with your resume then
06:37 - you can
06:37 - definitely email me on my email which is
06:39 - also in the description
06:41 - so next is hacker earth so hacker is a
06:45 - kind of different website compared to
06:46 - others they don't target
06:48 - interview preparation directly but they
06:50 - give you challenges and hackathons and
06:52 - hiring
06:53 - challenges where you can actually
06:55 - participate in one
06:56 - and you know get your job so i got
07:00 - i got my first job through a hackathon
07:02 - where we won the hackathon and then
07:03 - uh the first prize was uh the role so
07:06 - you can use the
07:08 - the platform to definitely uh uh
07:11 - gauge your building skills how you can
07:13 - actually build a product work with a
07:14 - team uh with the help of hackathon
07:16 - or you can just go to the hiring
07:18 - challenges and then see
07:20 - how it plays out definitely good for
07:22 - practice and real-world
07:24 - uh challenges where you know
07:27 - you can actually get a job fairly
07:29 - straightforward way we just compete with
07:31 - other people
07:32 - so yeah if you want uh this way uh if
07:35 - you feel this is more comfortable for
07:36 - you than uh you know
07:37 - uh doing hundred problems or twenty
07:39 - problems on lead codes and this
07:40 - this is definitely something we should
07:42 - check out
07:44 - the next thing is geekbookgeek so you
07:45 - must have definitely come across
07:46 - geeksforgeek at least once in your
07:49 - journey of computer science and
07:50 - programming uh this i think is just a go
07:52 - to place whenever you have any doubt or
07:54 - any problem
07:56 - and you just google uh it out and
07:58 - geeksforgeeks is the first
07:59 - link that pops up so i think use it for
08:01 - the exact same reasons
08:02 - uh they have made their website pretty
08:04 - uh much like much better than it was
08:07 - before and it's pretty good
08:09 - so you can i think check out more things
08:11 - you get your courses
08:12 - jobs all of that but i mainly use
08:14 - geeksforgeeks whenever i have
08:16 - a uh a syntax doubt or like a concept
08:20 - out and then uh one blog page or a blog
08:22 - post from vice helps me understand that
08:25 - very straightforwardly so i think that
08:27 - is something which i use giza gives for
08:29 - but yeah you can definitely go and check
08:31 - out uh how they help you with other
08:33 - things as well
08:35 - so next is interview bit so this is
08:37 - currently
08:39 - very famous for skiller academy where
08:41 - they
08:42 - try to get you a job as soon as possible
08:44 - and then
08:46 - take a chunk of your salary later on as
08:48 - a fee
08:49 - i am still very dicey about how they go
08:52 - about it so i would not recommend that
08:54 - but i would definitely recommend their
08:56 - platform for learning how to program
08:58 - uh system design databases uh this they
09:00 - also help you find a new job where you
09:02 - can
09:03 - update a resume you can wait for
09:04 - matching options and they're trying to
09:06 - gamify the process of job hunting
09:08 - but it is uh kind of tough and i would
09:11 - recommend this for
09:12 - people who would like to shift when they
09:14 - have like a year or two of experience
09:16 - i think they this would have them more
09:18 - than entry level people
09:19 - so i'm just putting this out there and
09:22 - if you would like to see them definitely
09:23 - go for it
09:25 - next i think is a very famous website
09:27 - called algo expert
09:29 - and i was very skeptical about them
09:31 - before since they just have like
09:33 - a very a few number of problems uh which
09:36 - you know only one fair problems which
09:38 - you can practice but
09:39 - uh the questions are pretty solid and
09:42 - they help you understand
09:43 - uh the basics of fundamentals really
09:45 - well and it is also very
09:47 - cheap compared to the other uh premium
09:50 - subscriptions and i think that is the
09:52 - best part about
09:52 - expert which is 50 dollars for a year so
09:55 - if you would like to
09:56 - check your netflix or prime subscription
09:58 - and just go for this
10:00 - then that would really really help you
10:01 - with your interviews
10:03 - and yeah it is legit it is good so
10:06 - definitely check it out
10:08 - the last but not the least here is the
10:11 - bible
10:12 - or the holy grail of programming
10:14 - interviews uh ctci
10:16 - they have been other books as well but i
10:18 - think this still does not beat the rest
10:21 - so they have around 189 problems and i
10:24 - think
10:25 - these 189 problems should be more than
10:26 - enough for your entry level jobs
10:28 - just make sure that you do them
10:29 - diligently and deliberately
10:31 - and i think this will be more than
10:32 - enough to crack your next interview
10:34 - but if you think that this book is a bit
10:36 - intimidating then definitely you have
10:38 - all these
10:38 - resources to help you so uh last but not
10:42 - the least another thing which i wanted
10:44 - to add
10:44 - uh a book for the fun of
10:47 - learning so blocking up blocking
10:50 - algorithms is another book
10:52 - so if you just want to learn how
10:56 - algorithms work in a very
10:57 - straightforward manner i would recommend
10:59 - this book uh
11:00 - which will help you understand
11:02 - algorithms very very very easily
11:05 - and it is a very very uh
11:08 - i would say a funny a really fun book to
11:11 - go through
11:11 - and it will be like a very good
11:13 - introduction to what you are stepping in
11:14 - so if you are
11:15 - uh in 11th or 12th grade and you are
11:18 - just stepping into college
11:20 - and you want to you know get a head
11:21 - start about computer computer science
11:23 - and programming that this would be the
11:24 - best book for you
11:25 - uh to start with uh very simple
11:27 - illustrations
11:28 - does require a bit of programming
11:30 - experience but i think you can just you
11:32 - know get that by a month's preparation
11:34 - so yeah these were all the websites
11:36 - which i think
11:37 - you can use to make sure that you have
11:40 - all the resources you need for your next
11:42 - indoor preparation job
11:43 - however this is not it uh this
11:45 - definitely does not help
11:47 - uh but you have to go through and
11:48 - practice and you know give
11:50 - time into your preparation but uh once
11:53 - you choose your
11:54 - uh or any one of them or two of them
11:58 - and then just keep practicing keep
12:00 - iterating people
12:01 - you know keep learning and enjoying the
12:04 - process
12:05 - uh the entire way i think you should be
12:07 - more than enough to get your next job
12:09 - so yeah this was the information that i
12:12 - wanted to provide today
12:13 - thank you for watching and i'll see you
12:14 - in the next one
