00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to explain you something
00:05 - about increment operator and assignment
00:08 - operator so let's get started first of
00:12 - all I will explain you how assignment
00:14 - operation
00:16 - works so let's take an example I will
00:19 - declare an integer X is equal to
00:26 - 25 and I'm going to print it very simple
00:29 - Stu
00:35 - thanks okay now for example I want to
00:39 - add to uh this value add some more value
00:44 - to this value I have shown you that you
00:47 - can do it like this x is = to
00:51 - x + 5 for example and what it will do is
00:57 - it will take the value of x and add five
01:01 - to it and place it into X once again
01:05 - right so let's build it and run it and
01:08 - it will show us 30 but the more
01:11 - efficient way to do this is because you
01:15 - are using x two times you can just
01:19 - reduce
01:20 - this by writing it something like this
01:25 - okay so X+ is equal to 5 it will just
01:28 - serve the same purpose as before it will
01:32 - add five to
01:34 - our variable which is X and then save it
01:38 - into the same variable once again I will
01:42 - run the program and answer is same and
01:46 - you can do this assignment operation
01:49 - with multiplication subtraction division
01:52 - or you can take a modulus so I will show
01:55 - you one by one first of all minus so
01:58 - what it will do is is it'll take X and
02:02 - subtract five from it and it will show
02:04 - the result it will save the result in
02:06 - this X and it will show the result here
02:08 - right
02:10 - so run the program and it shows 20 same
02:14 - is with product or multiplication you
02:17 - just give estx it will multiply 25 by
02:22 - 5 just run the program and you see
02:26 - 125 and you can do it with the division
02:29 - also so but remember it doesn't show the
02:33 - remainder only the multiplication value
02:36 - or multiple value right so in this case
02:40 - it will show five because we don't have
02:42 - any remainder but if
02:44 - you divide 25 by 4 it will
02:48 - still let's see what it gives us
02:52 - six and it doesn't show us the remainder
02:55 - in order to show the remainder you need
02:57 - to give this module sign and then then
02:59 - it will just show you the remainder
03:02 - which is one right so it shows the
03:04 - remainder
03:05 - one now this is about assignment
03:10 - operation now I have also told you about
03:13 - increment operation in the for Loop
03:16 - tutorial so for example you want to
03:20 - increment one or add one to the variable
03:26 - X then you can do it like this X Plus
03:29 - plus and what it will do it will add one
03:33 - to our variable X and print it here
03:37 - right now let me show you a phenomena of
03:42 - for how you can use this in two
03:46 - different ways so what I'm going to do
03:49 - is I'm just going to copy this and paste
03:52 - it here once again and what I'm going to
03:55 - do is I
03:57 - will increment X by one here just delete
04:02 - this and then I will show the value of x
04:06 - right and both I'm printing let's see
04:10 - what
04:11 - happens and you see what's happening
04:15 - here is it's even though we are
04:18 - increasing the value of x by one but
04:22 - it's showing 25 first and then
04:25 - 26 so this phenomena is uh happening
04:30 - because we are adding this Plus+ after
04:34 - our X okay so what will happen is it
04:38 - will your C++ code will print the value
04:43 - of x first and then add one to it and
04:47 - then when you print x to the second time
04:50 - it will show the add addition value so
04:54 - 26 it will show here but for example you
04:58 - want to add
05:01 - one or add this one before showing the
05:04 - value what what you need to do is you
05:07 - just need to add this Plus+ before this
05:11 - x now it will what it will do is it will
05:15 - add 1 2x first and then print this value
05:20 - and this will be the same so let's see
05:23 - what happens
05:25 - now
05:26 - just close our program
05:30 - and build
05:32 - it run it and you can see now this is
05:36 - 2626 so it takes the value of x
05:39 - increment it and then prints it this is
05:42 - the difference between
05:45 - this prefix of++ and trailing Plus+
05:49 - right so just remember if you want to
05:53 - increment the value first add these
05:56 - Plus+ in the front and if you want to
05:59 - increase increment the value after
06:01 - showing uh the value then you just add
06:06 - it after Plus+ same rule
06:11 - will be true for minus so when
06:15 - you do this XX xus minus here and when
06:20 - you run the
06:21 - program it'll still show you the value
06:24 - 25 because the subtraction is not
06:27 - happened here but it it's happened after
06:32 - the execution of this so in the next
06:34 - line then you can see 24 in the next
06:38 - line and when you add this minus minus
06:41 - in
06:43 - front then your value is subtracted
06:47 - first so one is subtracted from the X
06:51 - and then it prints 24 and then 24 so
06:54 - this is all
06:55 - about all the basics about assignment
06:59 - operator an increment operator I hope
07:01 - you understood the concept please wrate
07:03 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
