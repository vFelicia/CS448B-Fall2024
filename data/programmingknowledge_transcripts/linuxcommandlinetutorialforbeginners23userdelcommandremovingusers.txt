00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:03 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:06 - how to create users in Linux using
00:09 - command line now in this video I'm going
00:11 - to show you how you can remove users
00:15 - using uh command line terminal so first
00:18 - of all let's see whatever users we have
00:21 - so I'm going to just give LS and then
00:24 - forward SL home and you can see here we
00:28 - have three users one is one is my
00:31 - username and other is Tom so in order to
00:36 - remove a user what we do is we use a
00:39 - command called
00:41 - user Dell okay so this is the command to
00:45 - delete users and then whatever name you
00:48 - will give for example I want to remove
00:51 - this user called Mark so I will just use
00:54 - the user name Mark right and then you
00:58 - need to use use root permission so you
01:02 - uh use pseudo before this command so
01:04 - just write pseudo user Dell command and
01:08 - then the username you want to delete
01:10 - right and I'm going to press enter here
01:13 - and I'm going to give my password and
01:15 - press enter and once again I will see if
01:18 - the user is deleted or not so I will
01:20 - just Alis and forward
01:23 - slome now you will observe even if you
01:25 - have given this command user Dell which
01:28 - is used to delete the user the home
01:31 - directory for this user is not deleted
01:34 - right so what this command is doing is
01:37 - it's going to delete the username the
01:40 - password and other data for the user but
01:44 - it's not going to delete the home
01:46 - directory for the user and it's also
01:50 - important sometime because for example
01:53 - uh employee resigns from a company who
01:58 - have account on a operating system for
02:01 - example of that company and then he
02:04 - resigns and uh for example administrator
02:07 - wants to delete his username but wants
02:10 - to keep his data whatever work he has
02:13 - done right so this command uh is used to
02:17 - delete the user so user is deleted but
02:21 - the data home directory is still here
02:25 - right so this command is used to delete
02:28 - the user but the Home Direct will not be
02:30 - deleted but it's also really easy to
02:34 - remove the home directory as well as the
02:37 - user and for this you just need to use
02:39 - Pudo and then the command user Dell and
02:43 - also the name of the user so for example
02:46 - this time we want to remove the user
02:49 - called Tom so I'm going to just write
02:51 - the name Tom and you need to use the
02:54 - flag minus r with this in order to
02:58 - remove the home directory also right so
03:01 - this home directory will also be deleted
03:03 - if you use this minus r flag with this
03:07 - command and I'm going to press enter and
03:09 - you can see it uh shows uh that Tom
03:13 - maale spool not found so we haven't even
03:17 - created the any mail spool for this user
03:22 - so this warning is okay it's uh you know
03:25 - not important in our case right and
03:28 - let's go to the home directory once
03:30 - again and let's see what's there and you
03:32 - can see home directory is also deleted
03:35 - and the username and you know all the
03:37 - data for the user Tom is deleted so if
03:41 - you want to delete the user and also the
03:44 - home directory of the user then use
03:47 - minus r flag with user Dell command
03:50 - otherwise use uh user Dell with the
03:53 - username
03:54 - right now for example we want to remove
03:58 - this home directory for the user user
04:00 - how we can do it so it's also really uh
04:04 - simple but be careful with this command
04:07 - so just write uh P sudo RM so remember
04:11 - we have learned remove command or RM
04:14 - Command right so we will use this
04:16 - command so RM minus r and then forward
04:19 - slome and forward slash the username
04:23 - right but I once again tell you that you
04:28 - need to be careful with this command
04:29 - because it's going to remove all the
04:32 - data of uh this user or otherwise if you
04:35 - type uh you know wrong then it can
04:38 - remove the data from the other user also
04:40 - so be careful with this Command right
04:42 - and press enter once again we will uh
04:45 - list all the users and now this is also
04:49 - removed right so in this way you can
04:51 - remove user using Linux command line
04:54 - terminal I hope you've enjoyed this
