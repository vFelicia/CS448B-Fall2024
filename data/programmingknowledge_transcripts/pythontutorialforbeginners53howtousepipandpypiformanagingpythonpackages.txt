00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will talk about a special tool
00:06 - called Python pip so we are going to see
00:09 - what is Python pip and how to use Python
00:13 - pip so let's get started so first of all
00:17 - what is Python pip so pip is a
00:21 - command-line tool for installing and
00:24 - managing Python packages which are
00:27 - generally found on a special index
00:29 - called Python package index now if you
00:32 - want to know more about Python package
00:34 - index you can visit on a website called
00:38 - pi PI dot o-r-g PYP i dot o-r-g and you
00:43 - will be able to get more information
00:45 - about python package index on this
00:48 - website so what is python package index
00:51 - python package index or pi pi is a
00:54 - repository of software for python
00:58 - programming language
00:59 - now pi pi helps you to find and install
01:02 - software developed and shared by the
01:05 - Python community you can get more
01:08 - details about pi pi by clicking on this
01:11 - link or this link which are shown on the
01:15 - homepage of pi pi and you can see at the
01:18 - time of making this video there are
01:21 - almost more than 150,000 project
01:25 - available on this index and if you want
01:28 - to search for any special project you
01:31 - can search it using this search text box
01:35 - so let's see how we can use Python pip
01:38 - using command-line so generally whenever
01:42 - you have installed Python on your
01:45 - windows or any other operating system
01:47 - pip will be installed with the same
01:50 - installation of Python so if you have
01:53 - installed Python 3.4 or above most
01:56 - probably the Python pip
01:59 - will be already installed on your
02:02 - operating system now to check which
02:05 - version of pip is installed on your
02:07 - system you can give this command Python
02:10 - - - version and then press Enter
02:13 - and it's going to show you the version
02:15 - of PIP installed on your system so you
02:18 - can see pip ten point zero point one is
02:22 - installed on my Windows operating system
02:24 - and the Python version which it supports
02:27 - is three point seven now the first thing
02:30 - which you need to know about this tool
02:32 - called pip is how to use this tool so to
02:37 - know more about this tool you can give
02:40 - this command Python - - help and it's
02:43 - going to show you the commands which you
02:47 - can use with this command line tool so
02:50 - here you can see the usage you give the
02:52 - PIP command and then one of these
02:55 - command either install download
02:57 - uninstall list show and all these other
03:01 - commands in order to install a package
03:04 - or an installer package or get to know
03:06 - more about a particular package also
03:09 - there are some general options here
03:12 - which you can read so for example if you
03:14 - want to get help you give these options
03:16 - or if you want to print the verbose
03:18 - output you can use these options and if
03:22 - you want to know the version you can use
03:24 - these option and all these other options
03:26 - are available with this command line
03:29 - tool which is PIP so let me clear this
03:32 - command prompt with the command called
03:34 - CLS and I'm going to first of all go
03:37 - into the Python shell using Python
03:40 - command and in here I'm going to import
03:42 - a special package called flask and I'm
03:45 - trying to see if it's already there or
03:48 - not so I'm going to press ENTER and it's
03:51 - going to show me this error which says
03:53 - module not found error so this module
03:57 - flask is not right now recognized by my
04:00 - Python interpreter so let me just exit
04:04 - from this interpreter by just pressing
04:06 - exit and now I'm going to just give CLS
04:11 - so in order to know more about a
04:13 - particular package you give this command
04:15 - Python search and the name of the
04:19 - package so in my case I want to just
04:22 - search for a package called flask and
04:25 - I'm going to press ENTER and it's going
04:27 - to give me
04:28 - a big list of package which are related
04:31 - to flasks so because flask is a popular
04:34 - package on Python package index that's
04:37 - why you can see so many options for the
04:41 - flask
04:41 - package so I'm going to once again clear
04:44 - the terminal and I'm going to install
04:46 - this package which is flask so in order
04:50 - to install the package you give this
04:53 - command pip install and the name of the
04:56 - package and then press ENTER and it's
04:59 - going to start downloading this package
05:02 - so now you can see this package is
05:04 - successfully installed on my system and
05:06 - you can see the version which is
05:08 - installed is flask one point zero point
05:12 - two now in order to know more about a
05:14 - particular package which you have
05:17 - already installed you can give this
05:19 - command so in order to know more about
05:22 - the package which you have already
05:24 - installed you give pip show and the
05:27 - package name and when I give this
05:29 - command you can see the name of the
05:31 - package is flask the version which is
05:33 - installed is one point zero point two
05:35 - and there is a brief summary of this
05:38 - package also which is available here and
05:41 - the home page for this project is also
05:44 - available here who is the author and all
05:47 - the other details about this package
05:49 - which you may find useful are given here
05:52 - using this command which is PIP show and
05:54 - the package name now after installing a
05:57 - package I'm going to verify if this
05:59 - package is available using the Python
06:03 - shell or not and once again I'm going to
06:05 - try to import this package which is
06:08 - flask and then press enter and you will
06:11 - be able to see now I don't see any error
06:14 - so if you don't see any error this means
06:17 - that this package is successfully
06:20 - installed and in future you will be able
06:23 - to import this package to use it on any
06:26 - of your Python script which you create
06:29 - after installing this package so let me
06:31 - once again exit from the Python shell
06:33 - and let me clear the command prompt once
06:37 - again now in order to list out all the
06:39 - packages which are installed
06:41 - on your system you can give this command
06:43 - which is pip list which is going to
06:46 - print the list of all the packages which
06:48 - is already installed on your system now
06:51 - in order to uninstall any package you
06:54 - just need to give this command PIP
06:56 - uninstall and the name of the package
06:58 - for example I want to uninstall this
07:01 - package which we have installed which is
07:03 - flask and I'm going to press enter and
07:05 - you can see it says uninstalling flask
07:08 - and it will ask you whether you want to
07:10 - proceed or not so you just need to press
07:13 - Y in order to proceed and once you press
07:15 - Y it's going to just uninstall that
07:18 - package from your system and at the end
07:21 - you will see this message which says
07:23 - successfully uninstalled and the package
07:26 - name which you have uninstalled you can
07:29 - once again give this command pip list
07:31 - and now you can see flask is no more in
07:34 - the list of installed packages so this
07:37 - is how you can use Python pip in order
07:40 - to install and manage your Python
07:42 - packages I hope you have enjoyed this
07:44 - video and I will see you in the next
07:47 - video
07:55 - you
