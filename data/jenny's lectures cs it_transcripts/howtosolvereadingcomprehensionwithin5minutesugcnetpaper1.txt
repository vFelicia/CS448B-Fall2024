00:00 - reading comprehension some students
00:02 - think that
00:03 - it is very time consuming and it it
00:05 - needs a lot
00:06 - lots of practice to solve these kind of
00:08 - question
00:09 - so in the exam i am not going to attempt
00:11 - this i am going to leave it
00:13 - but some students think that it is just
00:15 - a passage we will
00:16 - read the passage and just will answer
00:18 - the questions no need to do any practice
00:20 - for this
00:21 - in both the cases you are mistaken in
00:24 - ugc net exam
00:26 - it is not you know the level is not too
00:28 - difficult that you are not able to solve
00:30 - this question within five minutes
00:31 - actually
00:32 - maybe sometimes it will take six to
00:34 - seven minutes also
00:36 - but yeah you can solve it easily but it
00:38 - is not that much
00:40 - easy that directly you can read at the
00:42 - time of exam only and you will solve
00:44 - five questions and you are able to solve
00:46 - five questions correctly
00:47 - right it is a medium a kind of easy to
00:51 - medium level is easy to medium but
00:54 - see to solve at least four question i'm
00:58 - not saying that you will
00:59 - you'll be able to solve all the five
01:00 - question but you can easily solve
01:02 - three to four question out of five
01:04 - question right
01:06 - just you need a little bit practice
01:09 - and a smart approach to solve reading

02:56 - i'll provide you in the description box
02:57 - of this video
02:58 - if you are interested you can go and
03:00 - check out now let us discuss the trick
03:02 - to solve reading comprehension question
03:04 - within five minutes
03:06 - see some ques some students also have
03:08 - this doubt
03:09 - also ask this question that should we
03:11 - solve rc question
03:13 - in the beginning or at the end so i
03:15 - would suggest
03:17 - neither in beginning nor at end because
03:20 - if you
03:21 - solve these questions at the end
03:22 - definitely you will have less time
03:25 - at the end you have 50 questions and 60
03:27 - minutes right
03:28 - and at that time you have less time and
03:31 - you have pressure of solving the
03:33 - question you have pressure of reading
03:34 - the passage then solving five questions
03:37 - definitely you will not get anything
03:39 - from that passage
03:41 - if you read that passage you know in
03:43 - pressure
03:44 - so if you you want to solve reading
03:46 - comprehension question do not
03:48 - leave it for the end and do not
03:51 - solve these question at the beginning
03:53 - because sometimes
03:55 - yeah obviously you got stuck somewhere
03:57 - and it will eat up your time and
03:59 - definitely
04:00 - then at that time it will create
04:01 - pressure on you like you have
04:03 - many question left and you have less
04:05 - time so rather than solving at the
04:07 - beginning at the end what you can do
04:09 - in the first go you can solve the
04:11 - question easy questions
04:13 - right within one minute you can solve
04:14 - those questions and then you can come to
04:16 - reading comprehension
04:18 - if you are good at this thing but
04:20 - suppose if you haven't practiced
04:22 - anything if you are very afraid of this
04:25 - thing
04:25 - then definitely you should leave it at
04:27 - the for the
04:28 - end but i guess in my opinion it is one
04:31 - of the easiest
04:32 - unit for your paper one and scoring as
04:35 - well
04:36 - because it is not that tough out of five
04:38 - question two question would be very easy
04:40 - two question you can say direct
04:41 - questions are there you can just
04:44 - you read the question and directly you
04:46 - will find out
04:47 - answer within three four or five lines
04:50 - of
04:50 - first three four five lines of that
04:52 - passage
04:53 - two question would be average type of
04:55 - question and one question is difficult
04:57 - question or you can say indirect
04:58 - question
04:59 - like they'll ask uh what is the moral of
05:02 - this
05:02 - uh given passage or maybe they can ask
05:05 - the title of this passage or what the
05:07 - author trying to say in this passage for
05:09 - answering of for to answer that question
05:12 - you have to read that passage thoroughly
05:14 - you have to understand the gist of that
05:17 - passage maybe that would be difficult
05:19 - for you but
05:20 - you can easily attempt three to four
05:21 - questions if you
05:24 - if you follow a smart approach so how to
05:26 - solve reading comprehension see
05:28 - in net exam you don't have much time to
05:31 - read the passage then
05:32 - read the question and all don't follow
05:35 - this approach that first read the
05:36 - passage
05:37 - then come to question what you have to
05:39 - do directly
05:40 - read questions so don't read the passage
05:44 - first read the question suppose you are
05:46 - reading first question
05:47 - right carefully because sometimes in
05:50 - question
05:51 - you have to take care of these kind of
05:53 - words like not
05:54 - not true or only these kind of
05:58 - tricky questions they can ask right and
06:01 - try to
06:02 - write down the you know special or you
06:05 - know special kind of uh
06:07 - words or keywords you can say or lines
06:09 - you can say
06:10 - from that question and just watch out
06:13 - the
06:13 - options given you don't have to memorize
06:16 - the question
06:17 - and the answers given you just have to
06:20 - go through those questions and the
06:22 - options to highlight
06:24 - some main keywords given in question and
06:26 - answer
06:27 - right after that directly go to the
06:30 - passage and try to find out
06:32 - those keywords or those lines or maybe
06:34 - those numbers
06:36 - in that passage right i think for first
06:39 - two question you can easily find out the
06:41 - answer within first
06:42 - four or five lines of that passage and
06:45 - while reading
06:47 - you have to read that passage with with
06:49 - full concentration
06:51 - it's not like that you are reading that
06:54 - comprehension and after reading three or
06:56 - four lines you are
06:58 - you know lost somewhere and you haven't
07:00 - get anything from those lines you have
07:02 - to visit that passage again
07:05 - so this is what wastage of time with
07:07 - full concentration read that
07:09 - passage at the first time only that you
07:12 - will get
07:12 - what is there in those lines maybe you
07:15 - don't have to memorize the passage also
07:18 - don't have to memorize the passage you
07:19 - don't have to memorize the question or
07:21 - the options given
07:22 - right but you have to read that passage
07:24 - with full concentration with attentive
07:27 - mind
07:28 - like in first go you can find out answer
07:30 - of
07:31 - the question right if see if you will
07:33 - read question first and
07:35 - if you will find out some keywords or
07:37 - some key points from that question or
07:39 - from
07:39 - that options given then when you are
07:42 - reading that passage your mind is what
07:44 - trying to locate those keywords and at
07:47 - that time it would be more attentive
07:49 - rather than without reading the question
07:52 - and you are reading the passage at that
07:54 - time you will not get anything from that
07:56 - passage
07:56 - i'm damn sure and sometimes maybe you
07:59 - find that keyword or that key point of
08:01 - that question in one line of that
08:03 - passage but still it is not the answer
08:05 - of that question
08:07 - maybe the answer is within surrounding
08:10 - two to three lines you have to read
08:12 - more lines to get the answer so you have
08:15 - to focus you have to
08:16 - read question very carefully that is
08:18 - very important
08:19 - and then try to find out the answer and
08:21 - next i have already told you do not try
08:23 - to memorize the passage
08:25 - while reading see for first question you
08:28 - have done this thing
08:29 - for second question also you have to do
08:30 - same thing read question
08:33 - read options given within just you know
08:35 - few seconds
08:37 - try to find out try to you know write
08:39 - down those keywords or main points of
08:41 - that question and answers
08:43 - and then directly jump to that passage
08:46 - try to find out those keywords and try
08:47 - to find out the answer of that
08:49 - uh question right now while reading
08:54 - that passage for these questions
08:57 - it's not like that you just find out the
08:59 - answer of this question that's it you
09:01 - have to
09:01 - understand try to understand the passage
09:04 - try to understand
09:05 - the gist of the passage what that author
09:07 - is trying to say
09:09 - at that time only because maybe fifth
09:11 - question is like this indirect question
09:14 - based on your understanding maybe they
09:15 - are asking the tone of
09:17 - that passage what is the title or maybe
09:20 - what is the moral or something like this
09:22 - right so it's not like that it shouldn't
09:24 - be like that for fifth question you
09:27 - you you need to read the passage read
09:29 - that passage again
09:31 - no while reading that passage for
09:34 - answering the questions
09:35 - first second third or fourth question
09:38 - just try to understand
09:39 - try to understand what the author is
09:42 - trying to say
09:44 - so try to understand the just of that
09:46 - passage in first
09:47 - reading only and next step is if you got
09:50 - stuck somewhere in the passage suppose
09:51 - if you are not getting answer
09:53 - meaning of any word or any line if you
09:55 - are not getting any line
09:57 - do not stuck at that line right
10:00 - it's okay if you are not able to
10:01 - understand that line if you are not able
10:03 - to understand that
10:04 - word skip it and read next line right
10:07 - do not stuck somewhere do not try to
10:09 - understand the meaning of each and every
10:11 - word given
10:12 - and each and every line given in the
10:13 - passage right it is not important you
10:15 - have to just
10:16 - try to understand the rest of that
10:18 - passage
10:19 - main idea right next is do not waste
10:22 - much time in finding answers like
10:25 - suppose
10:26 - in first reading you're not getting the
10:27 - answer suppose you are good at reading
10:30 - second time also you have read quickly
10:31 - and but still you are not getting the
10:33 - answer of that question
10:34 - leave that question do not stuck at that
10:37 - question like
10:37 - i will find out answer of this question
10:39 - definitely if you do so
10:41 - then definitely it will eat up your time
10:44 - and remember one thing
10:46 - the answers of the question would be
10:48 - always from that
10:49 - the information given within that
10:51 - passage suppose
10:53 - there is one topic on which the passage
10:55 - is given and you are aware
10:56 - aware about that topic but still don't
10:58 - try to you
10:59 - use your knowledge to answer that
11:01 - question like
11:03 - according to my according to me
11:04 - according to my knowledge the answer
11:06 - would be this
11:07 - but in the passage some something else
11:10 - is given
11:11 - so the answer would be what whatever is
11:13 - given in that passage
11:15 - try to answer the question whatever
11:17 - information is given
11:18 - in the passage based on that only do not
11:21 - use
11:21 - your knowledge yeah use your common
11:23 - sense and at last just want to say one
11:25 - thing
11:26 - try to solve one rc daily if suppose for
11:30 - one month you are solving
11:31 - uh rc problem 30 problems you are solved
11:34 - and that time try to find out your
11:36 - approach
11:37 - maybe this approach is not going to suit
11:39 - you maybe
11:41 - you are good at reading while maybe you
11:43 - have practiced a lot and you are good at
11:44 - reading so suppose
11:46 - at first you can read the passage right
11:49 - and if not the entire passage then you
11:52 - can read three to four lines of the
11:53 - passage
11:54 - so that you will have an idea what the
11:58 - message is all about
11:59 - then read the question and then you can
12:01 - answer those questions by reading that
12:03 - passage again
12:04 - it's up to you so approach would be
12:06 - yours only ultimately at the time of
12:08 - exam
12:08 - right so that's it for this video now
12:10 - i'll see in the next video till then bye
12:12 - take care
