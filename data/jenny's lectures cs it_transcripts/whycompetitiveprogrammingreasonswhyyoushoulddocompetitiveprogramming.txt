00:00 - what is competitive programming that
00:01 - thing i have already discussed in one of
00:03 - my previous video
00:04 - it is a kind of sport in which you write
00:06 - programs to solve given problems
00:08 - that thing i have already discussed you
00:09 - can check out that video in this eye
00:11 - button but why competitive programming
00:13 - what is the benefit of doing competitive
00:15 - programming
00:16 - is it just a competition to win or
00:17 - something else what you will get
00:19 - once you are into into in this field
00:21 - competitive programming field
00:23 - whether it is going to help you to get a
00:25 - good job
00:26 - all the things i am going to discuss in
00:27 - this video right
00:29 - but before that just want to tell you
00:30 - one thing an academy is also in this
00:32 - field now
00:33 - an academy in collaboration with code
00:35 - chef has started
00:36 - a course to learn competitive
00:38 - programming
00:39 - there you can take live classes these
00:42 - are free live classes
00:43 - and if you are not able to take the live
00:46 - classes it's okay
00:47 - no need to worry you can also watch
00:49 - their recorded sessions
00:51 - and who is going to teach you the top
00:52 - educators is going to teach you there
00:55 - who are already toppers of acm icpc i
00:58 - hope if you are interested in
01:00 - competitive programming you know what is
01:02 - icpc it is one of the oldest and the
01:04 - most prestigious
01:05 - programming contest in the world and
01:08 - these are also working in the top
01:09 - companies like google amazon flipkart
01:12 - they'll teach you how to approach a
01:13 - given problem
01:14 - how to solve that problem and if you
01:17 - like their free classes then you can go
01:19 - for their paid subscription
01:21 - the detail is over here if you use my
01:23 - code then you will get 10
01:24 - discount now what is the benefit of
01:27 - going for their paid courses
01:28 - you will get a proper structured course
01:30 - to learn competitive programming
01:32 - and as well as you can see upcoming
01:35 - classes like on what date at what time
01:37 - the next class would be conducted so
01:40 - it's better to take benefit of
01:41 - these free classes and if you like it
01:43 - you can go for the paid subscription
01:45 - so if you are interested i'll provide
01:47 - you all the details and the link of this
01:49 - course in the description box of this
01:51 - video you can go and check out
01:53 - now let us discuss the benefits of doing
01:55 - competitive programming the very first
01:56 - thing is what
01:58 - you will become stronger at your data
02:00 - structure and algorithm
02:02 - concepts you will be good at applying
02:04 - these data structures and algorithms
02:06 - like which kind of data structure
02:08 - would be used to solve this kind of
02:09 - problem which is
02:11 - best to use which data structure is best
02:13 - to use which
02:14 - algorithm is best to use to solve this
02:16 - problem
02:17 - so it will clear your fundamentals as
02:20 - well as the advanced level of data
02:22 - structure and algorithmic concepts and
02:24 - you know that dsa concepts are very
02:26 - crucial
02:26 - at the time of job interview they focus
02:28 - on more dsa concepts they ask
02:31 - you from questions from data structure
02:33 - basic data structure and
02:34 - algorithms not very advanced if you are
02:36 - a fresher right
02:38 - so it will help you to get stronger in
02:40 - the bsa concept
02:42 - second is it helps you to prepare very
02:44 - well for your coding interview or your
02:45 - technical interview
02:46 - right because the problems they ask in
02:49 - coding interview
02:50 - are a very low level then the problem
02:53 - you solve
02:54 - when you do competitive programming so
02:57 - you can create any coding interview
02:58 - easily if you do competitive programming
03:01 - and if you have a
03:03 - decent level of understanding of
03:05 - competitive programming
03:06 - right next is it will teach you how to
03:09 - solve
03:10 - the complicated problems the more
03:12 - complex problems because the problems in
03:15 - competitive programming
03:16 - after a level are very tough or very
03:19 - difficult
03:19 - you have to think very well
03:22 - sometimes it may take even many hours or
03:25 - even one day or two day to solve a given
03:28 - type of problem you
03:29 - the problem is given it's like a story
03:31 - type of problem you have to first of all
03:32 - understand that problem
03:34 - then you will divide the problem you can
03:36 - say uh subdivide the problem
03:39 - into smaller problems and then you solve
03:41 - that problem so these are very complex
03:43 - type of problems
03:44 - it is true that if you are applying for
03:46 - a software developer post or software
03:47 - engineer post
03:49 - then they don't require that you have
03:51 - extensive knowledge of
03:53 - algorithms and data structures yeah they
03:55 - want that you have good understanding of
03:57 - dsa concepts
03:58 - but by practicing the work that is
04:01 - harder
04:02 - then you actually do it's always be
04:05 - beneficial
04:06 - because if you need to work on a
04:09 - difficult uh problem or a difficult
04:11 - assignment
04:12 - then you can easily work on that so it's
04:15 - always good
04:16 - to solve to have ability to solve more
04:19 - complex
04:19 - problems to get practice to solve these
04:21 - kind of problems
04:23 - fourth is you will also come to know new
04:26 - and different ways to solve complex
04:28 - problems because you have to think the
04:29 - complex are very
04:31 - the problems are very difficult right so
04:34 - you have to solve that problem because
04:36 - you are in competition
04:38 - if you are participating in contests and
04:40 - these kind of competitions and
04:41 - as well as there is a deadline so by
04:44 - hooker group you have to solve that
04:46 - problem
04:46 - so at that time you will think in all
04:49 - directions
04:50 - so new ways new ideas will come into
04:53 - your mind
04:54 - how to solve that problem right and as
04:57 - well as it will teach you patience
04:58 - because sometimes the
05:00 - problem is very tough and maybe it will
05:02 - take many hours or maybe
05:04 - it can take one days or two days so you
05:07 - try
05:07 - solving that problem without giving up
05:10 - so it will teach you the
05:11 - patience also so it will teach you how
05:14 - to struggle
05:15 - you learn how to struggle with complex
05:17 - problems
05:18 - for long without giving up next is it
05:21 - will make you
05:22 - a faster and focused holder or
05:25 - disciplined coder right we can see there
05:28 - is some deadline also you have to
05:29 - complete those problems
05:31 - within that time limit to win that
05:32 - competition so definitely it will
05:34 - increase your speed and you will have to
05:36 - be more focused
05:37 - to think how to solve that problem which
05:40 - data structure will
05:41 - which algorithm is best to use to solve
05:42 - these kind of problems
05:44 - right next is it will teach you to write
05:46 - correct code a bug free code
05:49 - to solve a particular problem right the
05:51 - obviously the code should be correct
05:53 - i am not saying that a clean code i am
05:56 - saying a correct code
05:57 - right you will also discuss uh some
06:00 - drawbacks
06:01 - of doing this competitive programming
06:03 - also what skills you don't
06:05 - what skills competitive programming
06:07 - don't teach you that also we'll discuss
06:09 - but it will teach you to write correct
06:11 - code not clean code
06:12 - next is you have to deliver you have to
06:14 - write down you have to solve the problem
06:17 - under pressure so it will give you the
06:18 - ability to deliver results under
06:20 - pressure in a stressful condition
06:22 - because obviously it is a competition
06:23 - and you want to win everybody wants to
06:25 - win and there is a deadline also within
06:27 - that time limit you have to solve those
06:28 - problems
06:29 - so a pressure is there on you so in that
06:32 - stressful
06:33 - situation under that pressure you have
06:35 - to work you have to solve that problem
06:37 - you have to deliver
06:38 - the results so it will increase the
06:40 - ability of yours to deliver the results
06:43 - under pressure
06:44 - next is you will get referral easily
06:47 - if you are a suppose you are a six star
06:49 - coder seven star coder or
06:51 - if you have a decent level in
06:53 - competitive programming then also you
06:55 - will get referral easily because
06:56 - reference are required why if you are
06:59 - entire three college
07:01 - so in that colleges generally the big
07:02 - companies the big giant companies do not
07:04 - visit they don't come further on camp on
07:06 - campus placement you have to try for off
07:08 - campus and there
07:10 - the very first thing is what to get
07:12 - interview call
07:14 - right so for that one ways to get
07:16 - reference if somebody refers you then
07:18 - they'll call you and after that it's
07:20 - up to you you have to show your skills
07:22 - so if you are very good in
07:24 - competitive programming or if you have a
07:25 - decent level then you will get referral
07:27 - easily because
07:29 - the person knows yeah you have problem
07:31 - solving capabilities
07:33 - right you have something in your resume
07:35 - you have something you are something
07:37 - so they'll refer you easily right and
07:39 - after that obviously if you are in good
07:40 - in competitive programming then it's not
07:42 - very tough for you to crack their coding
07:44 - interviews their technical
07:45 - interview round fine but see it is not
07:48 - the only way
07:49 - to get a job to get referral yeah it is
07:51 - one way
07:52 - if you are in good in competitive
07:54 - programming it is just one way
07:56 - if you are not into this field and you
07:59 - have very
08:00 - good resume you have worked on good some
08:03 - good projects and you have done some
08:04 - internship
08:06 - then also you will get reference it's
08:08 - okay don't worry
08:09 - so if you have some experience in
08:10 - competitive programming what it will
08:12 - show you can solve complex problems
08:14 - you can work in stressful condition you
08:16 - can work under pressure
08:18 - you can manage time and deadline you can
08:21 - write bug free code like you can
08:22 - minimize errors
08:23 - you are a focused coder you are a
08:25 - disciplined
08:26 - quarter you are fast and these skills
08:29 - are indispensable
08:31 - these are going to help you to get a
08:33 - good job right
08:34 - and see if you participate in these kind
08:36 - of contest in coding contest
08:38 - and you have a good profile like six
08:40 - star code or seven star coder or some
08:41 - good rank
08:42 - or maybe if you participate in icpc in
08:45 - that case
08:46 - what companies do companies keeping
08:47 - track of these kind of events these kind
08:49 - of contests
08:50 - right and they search the talented
08:53 - people they will approach you at that
08:55 - time if you are very good
08:57 - they'll give you job offer they'll
08:58 - approach you so these are some benefits
09:00 - but what competitive programming will
09:03 - not teach you is what
09:04 - first thing is what it will not teach
09:07 - you how to write
09:08 - clean code maintainable code that is
09:10 - where required
09:11 - in software development field right but
09:14 - obviously it will help you if you are a
09:16 - good competitive programmer you are into
09:17 - this field and if you will switch to
09:19 - software development field it is going
09:20 - to help you
09:21 - right next thing what it will not teach
09:24 - you is
09:25 - have to work on large code bases
09:29 - and that exactly that's exactly you need
09:32 - you have to work on large code bases
09:34 - if you are into this software
09:36 - development field
09:37 - but that is not that competitive
09:39 - programming is not going to teach you
09:40 - third thing is it will not teach you how
09:42 - to use
09:44 - modern tools and technologies nowadays
09:46 - technology is changing rapidly
09:48 - many tools are coming in the market many
09:50 - technologies are there but what is there
09:51 - in
09:52 - competitive programming you just have to
09:53 - write code using those dsa concepts
09:56 - you are not habitual of using new new
09:58 - tools and new new technologies
10:00 - right and next is what it is not going
10:02 - to teach you the
10:03 - you know uh the design patterns that are
10:05 - required
10:06 - if you are applying for a software
10:08 - developer a software engineer post but
10:09 - that's okay everything is having their
10:11 - pros and cons
10:12 - and that's what competitive program is
10:13 - also having so that's it for this video
10:15 - now i'll see in the next video till then
10:17 - bye take
