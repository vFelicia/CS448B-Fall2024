00:00 - so the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen Loop control
00:04 - statement uh break uh continuant pass
00:08 - right next thing is it's a small topic
00:12 - but it's very important when it comes to
00:15 - Python language what is indentation
00:18 - right what is indentation why it is so
00:21 - important in Python
00:22 - it's not so much important in other
00:25 - languages but in Python it's mandatory
00:27 - and essential concept
00:29 - you have to follow the indentation rule
00:31 - while you are writing a python code
00:33 - right now what is indentation it is C
00:38 - if you write like if statement or four
00:40 - statement these kind of things then
00:42 - suppose I'm writing
00:44 - four four I in range a simple example
00:49 - five
00:51 - and then once you will hit enter then
00:54 - automatically in editors like in those
00:58 - we can say we are working in pie chart
01:00 - ID
01:02 - automatically cursor would be here
01:04 - it will leave some white spaces
01:07 - and here suppose we are writing print
01:10 - hi
01:12 - right so this line would be a part of
01:15 - this four
01:16 - right
01:17 - this white space this white space these
01:21 - white spaces
01:22 - at the beginning of the line
01:25 - is known as indentation simply
01:28 - right
01:29 - now why this indentation is so important
01:32 - see these spaces and by default these
01:35 - spaces in Python is wrote four spaces
01:38 - one two three four or you can see one
01:41 - tab right four spaces
01:44 - now so these four spaces or you can say
01:46 - one tab
01:48 - right
01:49 - now why this indentation is so important
01:52 - see in other languages if you write for
01:53 - Loop or if statement like in C if you
01:55 - write for Loop then four like I is equal
01:58 - to 0 I less than same if I am writing
02:02 - less than equal to 4 and I plus plus
02:04 - and there we use these braces curly
02:09 - braces to indicate a block of code means
02:11 - this is blue body this is block of code
02:13 - so here I can write something like print
02:17 - hi or I'm again adding print
02:20 - two statements
02:23 - means these two statements are one block
02:26 - of code so this is a block of code
02:32 - under this for Loop right so when you
02:34 - are you want to indicate a block of code
02:36 - in other languages C C plus plus Java we
02:38 - use these braces right
02:40 - in these languages if you use this
02:43 - indentation that is just for readability
02:45 - purpose or you can say it's just a
02:47 - decoration item right to decorate your
02:49 - program to look at better but in Python
02:53 - indentation is a mandatory concept you
02:55 - have to follow this when you are writing
02:57 - a python code because in Python this
03:00 - indentation indicate is used to indicate
03:02 - a block of code there is no braces here
03:06 - right
03:08 - so
03:09 - here how to indicate suppose these two
03:12 - lines
03:13 - hi Jenny I won't
03:17 - within this for Loop so these two lines
03:20 - should be indented means this
03:22 - indentation indicate that this is a
03:26 - block of code in Python right
03:29 - and
03:30 - within a same block of code like these
03:34 - two statements are within this code
03:37 - block so these two lines or whatever
03:39 - lines will have one two three four five
03:41 - six lines all the lines should be should
03:44 - have same number of indentation
03:46 - right like here we have four spaces
03:48 - every line should have four spaces four
03:51 - spaces four spaces if you write
03:52 - something like this
03:54 - if you write this print here here
03:58 - Jenny
04:01 - suppose one two three spaces before the
04:03 - sine four spaces before this line then
04:05 - also it will give indentation error
04:07 - wrong indentation right because every
04:10 - line
04:12 - within this four
04:15 - four you know for Loop or within a same
04:18 - block
04:20 - should be
04:21 - should have same number of indentation
04:23 - right now usually we have four spaces by
04:27 - default right but
04:30 - it's up to user
04:31 - four spaces eight spaces seven spaces
04:34 - but at least once space should be there
04:39 - if you don't want to use four spaces
04:41 - just put one space after this four Loop
04:44 - one space and right print high one space
04:46 - print Journey
04:48 - that would also be considered as
04:50 - indented block right
04:52 - so I hope now you go why indentation is
04:55 - so important in Python it is used to
04:57 - indicate a block of code because in
04:59 - Python we don't have these kind of curly
05:01 - braces to indicate a block of code right
05:05 - and one more thing the first line of the
05:07 - Python code cannot be indented suppose
05:10 - the very first line in the Python
05:12 - program I am suppose writing like a
05:16 - variable a is equal to 5.
05:18 - and if you have put some space before
05:21 - this line suppose one space it will give
05:23 - error so first line should not be
05:25 - indented in Python
05:27 - right let me just show you with the help
05:29 - of program
05:30 - okay so let's create a new file here
05:36 - indentation
05:37 - dot sorry Dot py right
05:42 - so let's take save like I'm taking a
05:45 - four Loop or I in
05:48 - like range 5. all right see once you
05:54 - will enter my cursor is here now
05:56 - if I enter Then by default here in ide
05:59 - it will give you cursor here with four
06:02 - spaces right indented
06:05 - so here I'll be writing like print
06:10 - hi to statement
06:14 - print Jenny so this white space this
06:17 - white space at the beginning of these
06:19 - lines or the code or statement that is
06:21 - known as indentation now it is
06:23 - indicating that these two lines are
06:25 - within a within same block of code and
06:28 - that is under this for Loop right this
06:31 - is the body of the loop so basically we
06:34 - use indentation to indicate a block we
06:37 - use in this when you are defining a
06:38 - function or if well statements or for
06:41 - Loop
06:42 - there we have to define a block
06:45 - so that is what let's let's run this see
06:48 - hi Jenny it will print five times and
06:51 - if suppose
06:54 - I am not
06:56 - you know putting any indent on this line
06:59 - that is fine it's okay now this line
07:02 - would be considered as a part of this
07:04 - four
07:06 - Loop of the body so this line this line
07:08 - is
07:10 - one code block
07:12 - and this 4 and print these line the
07:15 - first line and the third line these are
07:17 - Under the same block of code right
07:19 - because they are at same intent because
07:22 - there is no intent in this line
07:24 - so high would be printed five time and
07:26 - then ultimately Jenny would be printed
07:28 - only one time right but if I put suppose
07:30 - two space and here we have only here we
07:34 - have four spaces here we have two spaces
07:36 - so the number of spaces are not equal in
07:39 - these lines so that will give you an
07:41 - error see indentation error
07:44 - an intent does not match any outer
07:46 - indentational level because this line
07:49 - this line is having four in
07:52 - you what a four spaces and this line is
07:55 - having two spaces so before that there
07:58 - is no line which is having two spaces
07:59 - this for Loop is having zero space
08:04 - you know at the beginning before
08:06 - starting off this line and by default
08:08 - these are four spaces and in Python for
08:11 - indentation it is preferred to use
08:13 - spaces rather than tabs in Python
08:16 - language right okay when you will go for
08:20 - the in that python dot you know orj
08:22 - website in documentation you will get in
08:24 - tabs and spaces in that you know
08:28 - under that thing that in Python you
08:31 - should use white spaces rather than tabs
08:33 - too
08:35 - uh to give some indentation in your
08:38 - program right
08:41 - same if if I write here
08:44 - another block like if I'm writing a
08:47 - condition if I equal to equal to
08:50 - 3.
08:52 - then
08:53 - see again cursor is indented further
08:56 - indented now we have eight spaces
09:00 - right suppose print
09:05 - welcome
09:07 - right and after this I am printing print
09:12 - bar
09:13 - take care
09:15 - this line
09:16 - so let us run this and see
09:18 - hi Jenny would be printed
09:20 - right
09:23 - this this range will generate 0 1 2 3 4.
09:29 - so for zero highs and it would be
09:30 - printed then for one then for two three
09:33 - times then once I becomes three
09:36 - it also print welcome because this
09:38 - condition is also satisfied so it will
09:39 - go under this block under this block we
09:41 - have only one statement welcome would be
09:44 - printed then again for 4
09:48 - till the end of the this range it will
09:50 - print hi Jenny and then bye take care
09:52 - right so see further
09:55 - it is having now eight spaces so it is
09:58 - further indented if within this I'm
10:01 - again writing if
10:04 - like true
10:10 - although it doesn't make any sense
10:12 - because true is always true but just to
10:14 - show you the intensity once you will
10:16 - enter here then this line is again
10:19 - indented again
10:21 - four spaces then four spaces then again
10:24 - four spaces
10:25 - right
10:27 - means here we are having 12 spaces so
10:30 - this is what indentation will give you
10:33 - indicate a block of code
10:35 - this block
10:37 - these two lines are in the same look
10:39 - sorry these three lines
10:41 - because if is also the one two three the
10:44 - second third and fourth line are having
10:46 - same indentation so these are Under same
10:48 - low
10:50 - then this these two lines are under same
10:53 - log because same indentation level is
10:55 - there then if we write like print
10:58 - hello so now this line is
11:01 - Within
11:03 - a new block right like this
11:07 - so I hope you got you know basic idea
11:09 - about indentation and why this is so
11:11 - important in Python so I hope you got
11:13 - what it what is indentation in Python
11:15 - and why this is so important in Python
11:17 - language right now from the next video
11:19 - we'll be working on a exercise that is
11:21 - on a game basically Hangman game so now
11:24 - we'll see in the next video till then
11:25 - bye take care
