00:00 - so in the series of running Python
00:02 - programming language till now we have
00:03 - discussed some control statements say
00:05 - what is if what is a fails and when
00:07 - coding exercise for that program to find
00:09 - out whether number is even a road simple
00:11 - one right so now few more conditional
00:14 - statements are nested if yesterday fails
00:17 - alif statements right so these thing
00:18 - we'll be discussing in this video with
00:20 - the help of program with the help of
00:21 - real life example the syntax flowchart
00:23 - and everything about nested if necessary
00:27 - defense and alif statements will be
00:28 - discussing in this video right first of
00:30 - all see what is nested nested if means
00:33 - if inside if
00:36 - that is nested if something like this if
00:39 - I write what is the syntax if then we
00:42 - write condition
00:44 - and colon right then
00:47 - if block statements simple if right so
00:51 - if I write something like this like if
00:54 - condition I'm taking suppose this is
00:56 - condition one
00:57 - right and here I am writing suppose
01:00 - statement one
01:03 - and inside this if again I am taking one
01:06 - more if
01:08 - and this time condition
01:10 - 2 and within this if we have some
01:14 - statements like we can say statement two
01:16 - or block of statements can be there so
01:18 - this F is within this ZIP so if inside
01:21 - if this is known as nested if right
01:25 - there can be multiple
01:27 - nested if any number of nested if is
01:29 - possible within this if we can also
01:31 - write one more if if condition 3 within
01:34 - this we can also write if condition 4
01:36 - like this this is level of nesting but
01:39 - one thing which is very important in
01:40 - Python is what the indentation the
01:44 - indentation will identify the level of
01:48 - nesting see these statements are what
01:51 - within this if this statement is these
01:55 - statements are within this if because of
01:57 - this indentation we can find out we can
02:00 - identify right the level of nesting so
02:03 - the indentation is very important
02:05 - whenever you are working in Python right
02:07 - so this simple example like real life
02:11 - example also when if your mom asks like
02:14 - whether you are going to a supermarket
02:16 - like if go to supermarket maybe you will
02:19 - say yes this condition is true then
02:22 - another
02:23 - order is what if like
02:26 - if apples are available by apples so if
02:28 - apples are available by apples means
02:32 - this condition should be true to enter
02:34 - within this block
02:36 - to check this condition
02:38 - if this condition is true then only we
02:40 - will enter here and this condition would
02:42 - be checked if this condition is true
02:43 - then we will enter here then statement 2
02:45 - will be executed if this statement is
02:46 - false then will not enter here we will
02:50 - not check the second condition
02:52 - if your mom asked whether you go to
02:55 - supermarket you will say no then
02:57 - obviously she'll not say if apples are
03:00 - available by apples and all right no
03:02 - means yes out of this complete if right
03:07 - so this is nested if
03:09 - why
03:10 - we'll see this thing with the help of an
03:12 - example right practically also I'll show
03:14 - you now you just see the sentence
03:17 - nested if else means what if the
03:20 - complete if else construct is within
03:24 - either this if or else block that is
03:28 - nested if else
03:31 - maybe it's confusing for you let me just
03:33 - show you with the help of example and
03:35 - syntax so what is nested if else the
03:37 - syntax of that is what simple if else is
03:40 - what if condition one
03:42 - then some block of statement if block
03:45 - statement then simply we write what
03:48 - else
03:49 - and else block statement
03:52 - right
03:53 - or we can say right do this
03:56 - orange block statement but within this
03:58 - if or within the sense we write another
04:00 - if else that is nested if else so within
04:04 - this if we write another if else if
04:06 - condition 2 statement 2
04:08 - else
04:11 - suppose
04:13 - statement
04:14 - 3 so this is what complete if else block
04:20 - if else construct
04:22 - if else so this complete is within this
04:24 - F so this is nested difference
04:27 - and in else we simply have suppose
04:29 - statement 4.
04:31 - or do this statement four this is
04:34 - example syntax of nestative another
04:36 - thing is what rather than within this if
04:39 - this complete block can be here also
04:41 - here we have only if condition one
04:43 - statement one then else
04:45 - statement 4 and complete this block that
04:49 - is also nested if else if this block can
04:51 - be here and here both
04:54 - within if also within else also that is
04:57 - also nested difference
04:59 - right but this complete if else
05:01 - construct should be within
05:03 - if or else that is nested difference
05:06 - right so for that let's take one example
05:11 - if suppose
05:14 - we are going to amusement park for a
05:16 - roller coaster ride right and there the
05:20 - condition is if you are more than three
05:22 - feet
05:23 - more than or equal to three feet you can
05:25 - ride
05:26 - right
05:27 - but
05:29 - now they will ask your age if your age
05:31 - is less than 18 less than or equal to 18
05:34 - you will pay only 250 rupees or greater
05:37 - than 18 you will pay 500 rupees
05:40 - so how you will write down this thing
05:42 - see
05:44 - something like this first of all they'll
05:47 - ask what is your height in feet I am
05:50 - take note in centimeter so if height is
05:52 - greater than or equal to 3 means it will
05:55 - print you can ride but now
05:58 - on paying what amount you have need to
06:01 - pay on that also you need to put some
06:03 - condition so if
06:04 - age is less than or equal to 18 you will
06:07 - pay 250 rupees so obviously you will ask
06:10 - they'll ask from the user like what is
06:12 - your age
06:16 - so again we will take input right within
06:20 - this if you will take input age what is
06:22 - your age
06:23 - then on edge we will check one more
06:25 - condition if age is less than equal to
06:27 - 18.
06:29 - so whatever you will write within this
06:31 - if that should be from here some
06:33 - indentation you need to provide like
06:35 - print
06:37 - pay 250 rupees
06:41 - else
06:47 - pay 500 rupees right so this fl's
06:51 - complete block is within that if
06:54 - right
06:55 - else
06:57 - see this L says for this if so you have
07:00 - to take care of this indentation right
07:02 - so else
07:04 - print if height is
07:07 - Less Than 3 means not greater than or
07:10 - equal to 3 you cannot write
07:13 - simply you cannot write
07:15 - and after this if else I am taking one
07:18 - more
07:19 - statement by
07:21 - something like this so this is what
07:23 - example of nested effects so if first
07:26 - one it will ask enter your height in
07:28 - feet so I am entering suppose four
07:31 - so this condition is true
07:33 - yes this condition is true then only we
07:35 - can enter here so it will print you can
07:36 - write now it will ask what is your age I
07:39 - am supposed entering 15. so again check
07:41 - the condition h less than equal to 18
07:45 - yes condition is true less than 18 so
07:48 - pay 250 rupees you need to pay 250
07:50 - rupees and that's it now after after
07:51 - printing this pay 250 rupees it will
07:54 - print
07:55 - it will be out of this if else complete
07:57 - fence and it will print bye because this
08:00 - statement is out of this it feels low
08:02 - complete difference right if I enter
08:04 - height is 2 feet
08:07 - is this true No so at that time control
08:10 - will not enter in this if blow this
08:12 - condition would not be checked they will
08:14 - not ask age because no need simply
08:17 - they'll it will go to the else part and
08:20 - it will print cannot write and buy right
08:23 - so this is example of nested if else but
08:25 - here we have only two condition
08:27 - we are checking only height and age
08:30 - that's it
08:31 - right but what if we have three choices
08:35 - what if I want to add one more condition
08:37 - if age is less than 12 then only 150
08:42 - rupees if age is between 12 to 18 then
08:45 - 250 rupees if age is between age is
08:47 - greater than 18 then 500 rupees so we
08:50 - have three choices now
08:52 - on age
08:53 - so like at that time we should use l if
08:58 - else else means else if
09:01 - more than two Alternatives if you have
09:03 - then we use alif
09:06 - right to make the program more readable
09:08 - and all so how you can modify this
09:10 - program now that till now it would be
09:13 - same if age is less than equal to now
09:17 - less than 12 if phase is less than 12
09:19 - then please pay 150 rupees
09:24 - right after that we will check else if
09:27 - age is between 12 to 18. else if we need
09:30 - to write down right so we will use alif
09:33 - e l i f that is lcf LF
09:39 - H is what less than equal to 18.
09:45 - is less than equal to 80 means obviously
09:46 - this condition is for
09:48 - if less than 12 then here if greater
09:51 - than 12 but less than equal to 18 then
09:53 - here so no need to put a is like greater
09:57 - than 12 and logical and operator Rand is
10:00 - less than or equal to 18. this is also
10:01 - fine right now please pay 250.
10:06 - else if or rather than else if because
10:09 - we have only three choices
10:11 - so simple else is also there hence
10:14 - obviously if not 12 not
10:17 - less than 12 not between 12 to 18 then
10:21 - you would be greater than 18. so for
10:22 - that simple else no need to put any
10:24 - condition like else if a is greater than
10:27 - 18 because by default age would be now
10:28 - then greater than 18. so else
10:32 - pay
10:35 - 500 rupees
10:37 - right so this is what if alif we can say
10:42 - if elephant
10:45 - else block right and in else simply
10:49 - cannot write
10:51 - so we have if more than one more than
10:53 - two alternative then we use alif
10:56 - now General syntax of alif let me just
10:58 - write down
10:59 - we'll see these programs on our laptop
11:01 - will I will show you the output this is
11:03 - General syntax of writing alif if then
11:06 - condition then statement one then alif
11:08 - condition two condition three many
11:10 - condition can be there so that will use
11:12 - an alif right and after that
11:17 - finally else
11:19 - with colon and else block statement and
11:21 - after this whatever you can write after
11:24 - this if L if else block statements
11:27 - whatever you will write that would be
11:29 - executed after this thing right now I
11:33 - hope you can draw the flowchart of this
11:35 - la
11:36 - or the nodes I'll provide in the
11:38 - description box of this video you will
11:39 - find out there the flowchart first of
11:42 - all let you try out
11:44 - flowchart of this thing right or I have
11:47 - also discussed this this thing the
11:49 - flowchart of L if while you are
11:51 - discussing
11:52 - an early statement in C plus plus you
11:55 - can check out that video also now
11:58 - see for that the roller coaster ride for
12:00 - nested if else we have discussed and
12:03 - this kind of flowchart we can do like
12:05 - start then first of all check the height
12:09 - height is greater than equal to 3 feet
12:15 - two choices yes foreign
12:20 - cannot write
12:22 - if yes
12:24 - then obviously we'll ask age
12:29 - yes
12:30 - before asking age we just print can
12:32 - write
12:36 - because we have printed can write and
12:37 - after that age
12:40 - now age we will ask
12:43 - if age is
12:45 - less than equal to 18 or greater than 18
12:48 - if greater than 18 then what
12:52 - pay 500 rupees
12:55 - and less than equal to 18 then simply
12:58 - pay 250 rupees
13:01 - that's it
13:04 - that program you have discussed the
13:05 - flowchart of that thing right so this is
13:08 - what that if else block Minister defense
13:10 - block
13:15 - and after this whatever you will write
13:17 - after those if else after these three
13:20 - those statements would be executed right
13:23 - so now I have one question for you
13:26 - I am asking from user
13:29 - number
13:30 - and if I enter 1 it should print one if
13:34 - I enter 2 it should print like two if I
13:36 - enter 3 it should print 3 if I enter 4
13:39 - it should print 4 something like this
13:40 - these four cases
13:43 - so you will enter and we will write
13:46 - something like this if we will check if
13:48 - number
13:49 - equal to equal to 1 then print
13:54 - one
13:55 - right one way is if again we check if
14:00 - number equal to equal to 2 one way is
14:03 - this
14:04 - we can put four if condition right
14:06 - answer would be
14:08 - right
14:09 - but this is not efficient if suppose I
14:12 - enter number is 1 if I enter 1 so it
14:16 - will ask it will check this condition
14:17 - one equal to 1 yes so it will print one
14:20 - but it will check this condition also
14:24 - because this is after this if so if
14:27 - number equal to 2 this condition is not
14:28 - true it will check this condition also
14:30 - not true this condition also not true
14:31 - then whatever you will suppose I am
14:34 - entering after this bye
14:36 - then it will print by but if the con
14:39 - this condition is true obviously no need
14:41 - to check the these conditions so this is
14:43 - not efficient way to write program so
14:45 - for this thing we write what else
14:49 - so we can write down if this number is
14:53 - this sorry we have to put colon also
14:55 - otherwise it will give error in Python
14:58 - right so we can write down here else
15:01 - if number is this else if number is this
15:05 - else
15:07 - if number is this or else any other
15:10 - thing so rather than else if because we
15:12 - have more than two choices here
15:15 - so here we write L if so here we can
15:18 - write
15:19 - L if number two this
15:22 - hell if this
15:25 - alif number for this and after this
15:28 - simple else we can write down else
15:31 - print
15:36 - wrong input
15:37 - something like this and after this print
15:39 - y
15:41 - so now at this point of time if you
15:43 - enter 1 so it will check this condition
15:45 - number equal to 1 equal to 1 yes
15:47 - condition true so it will print one
15:49 - and it will not not check this condition
15:52 - it will not check this condition it will
15:54 - not check this condition it will not
15:55 - check this condition because this if
15:58 - this condition is true so after that
16:00 - directly it will print by so obviously
16:02 - it will save your time execution time
16:04 - time complexity of this program right so
16:07 - these are some efficient way that is why
16:09 - we use this if else L if and these
16:11 - statements so let me just show you
16:13 - practical of these things so let's
16:16 - create a new file
16:20 - nested if underscore else
16:24 - Dot py
16:26 - and we will take what
16:31 - yesterday first of all let me just show
16:33 - you that nested if example suppose I am
16:36 - taking a number a is equal to Let's
16:37 - suppose 52.
16:40 - and we are checking if
16:42 - not put this in condition in these
16:44 - brackets
16:45 - a
16:46 - modulo 2 equal to equal to 0
16:49 - then
16:51 - print
16:54 - even because this is even number but
16:57 - again
16:58 - I will check if the number is even one
17:00 - more condition you need to check if this
17:03 - number is greater than
17:06 - 30.
17:10 - okay here we need to put
17:12 - column right
17:14 - then see automatically whenever we I
17:17 - enter here in this ID that would be in
17:19 - indented write this print because this
17:22 - print statement is within this ship
17:24 - right so I'll print number is greater
17:28 - than 30 great and after that
17:32 - simply I am going to print
17:36 - bye
17:38 - out of this if so this is what yesterday
17:42 - right let me just run this and I'll show
17:45 - you
17:45 - see obviously a number is 52 so this
17:48 - condition is true so first of all it
17:50 - will print even right and yes then we'll
17:53 - check on more condition if it is greater
17:55 - than 30 yes that is also true so it will
17:57 - print number is greater than 30 great
17:58 - and then buy right if suppose number is
18:01 - 51 let me just run this
18:04 - but this time it will print only by
18:06 - because this condition is not true so we
18:09 - will not check this condition although
18:10 - number is greater than 30 but we will
18:12 - not check this condition because this if
18:14 - is within this F
18:17 - so to check this condition this
18:18 - condition need to be true so directly
18:21 - reference is nested
18:22 - now nested defense let's take that
18:25 - example only that roller coaster ride
18:34 - so see if height is greater than equal
18:37 - to 3 then can ride but now payment we
18:41 - will ask for payment will ask h
18:43 - soil input edge here
18:46 - so we now put condition on age so see
18:49 - I'm actually from that C plus plus C and
18:51 - Java back down that is why I used to put
18:53 - condition in that brackets
18:56 - but it's okay you can put break it also
18:58 - otherwise also fine if you don't put any
19:01 - bracket if age
19:03 - greater than
19:07 - less than equal to 18.
19:10 - then within this if we print
19:13 - please pay 250 rupees and this else this
19:17 - else is for this if so that is why C the
19:20 - indentation this is here only else
19:24 - please pay 500.
19:27 - rupees right and okay now this if else
19:31 - is done so for this if we need to put
19:34 - one else so that we put here for this if
19:38 - cannot write
19:40 - and after it fails let's print I
19:44 - so now let's run this
19:48 - what is your height
19:50 - 2 simply it will print cannot ride by
19:53 - it will not ask age
19:56 - so let's run this again what is your
19:58 - height
19:59 - 5.
20:00 - yes you can write now what is your age
20:03 - a suppose I am 25
20:07 - okay
20:08 - so please pay 500 rupees and then buy 25
20:12 - is because obviously this condition is
20:14 - not true age is not less than equal to
20:15 - 18 so please pay 500 rupees and then buy
20:18 - so this is nested defense
20:20 - right
20:21 - so please take care of this indentation
20:24 - now next is alif suppose
20:27 - that age is what
20:30 - less than 12
20:32 - what three condition I need to put less
20:34 - than 12 then please pay only 150 rupees
20:38 - now else if so rather than else if we
20:41 - write
20:42 - alif
20:43 - L if
20:45 - age now
20:47 - less than equal to 18.
20:50 - then please pay 250 rupees
20:56 - right
20:58 - else
21:00 - no need to put any condition because
21:03 - sorry
21:05 - else
21:07 - we simply print
21:13 - please pay
21:16 - 500 rupees
21:20 - fine else can't contrite so that is only
21:24 - so here you can put many alif
21:27 - if you have four five six condition you
21:30 - can put LF lfl if something like this
21:31 - right so let's run this
21:35 - what is your height five
21:38 - now what is your age suppose I am 11.
21:41 - so please pay 150 rupees only and buy
21:44 - let's run this again
21:47 - what is your height 5
21:49 - and age is suppose
21:52 - 13.
21:54 - so it's greater than
21:55 - 12 but less than 18 so we should print
21:58 - 250.
22:01 - 250 rupees and we run this again
22:04 - height is 6.
22:06 - age is suppose 34.
22:09 - so please pay 500 rupees and buy
22:13 - I hope you got this elif concept also
22:15 - now try out
22:17 - these things more and more a leaf write
22:20 - down in the program rather than within
