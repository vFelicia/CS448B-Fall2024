00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:01 - c we are discussing printing pattern
00:03 - programs in c
00:04 - we have discussed many printing pattern
00:06 - programs and in this video i will talk
00:07 - about how to print this pattern
00:09 - first of all we'll discuss the logic on
00:11 - this whiteboard then i'll show you the
00:12 - output on my laptop using base code
00:14 - editor
00:15 - right now first thing when you see the
00:17 - pattern what you have to do you have to
00:18 - just
00:19 - check like number of rows and number of
00:21 - columns
00:22 - right so let me draw it something like
00:28 - this
00:30 - now see here how many number of rows you
00:32 - have to print one two three four
00:34 - five right so one loop is for number of
00:37 - rows
00:38 - so that is i loop will take the variable
00:41 - i
00:41 - i is equal to one here 2 3 4
00:44 - and 5 right number of columns 1
00:48 - 2 3
00:52 - 9 and this number of columns the group
00:55 - would be
00:57 - j the variable would be j right
01:00 - now here see one loop is
01:04 - to take care of number of rows one loop
01:07 - is we are discussing we will take here
01:10 - three loops one is
01:12 - for these space before printing this
01:14 - star
01:15 - how many spaces in this line
01:18 - four in this line three then two
01:22 - then one here we have zero space right
01:25 - so one loop would take care of these
01:27 - spaces
01:28 - and third loop would be responsible to
01:31 - print
01:32 - these stars so ultimately we would use
01:36 - here
01:36 - three loops right so the outer loop
01:39 - would be
01:39 - what just to take care of what number of
01:42 - lines or number of rows
01:44 - and that loop would be from 1 to 5
01:47 - here in this case right so now let me
01:50 - write down the logic here
01:51 - first first loop would be i is equal to
01:54 - 1 i less than equal to 5
01:56 - and i plus plus this says
01:59 - just to take care about the number of
02:00 - lines now
02:02 - within this loop two loops one for space
02:05 - one to print
02:07 - the stars now see when
02:10 - i value is observe the pattern now
02:14 - when i value is 1 in first line how many
02:18 - space
02:18 - 4 then we have one star
02:22 - right in second line
02:26 - three spaces and two star in third line
02:30 - two spaces and three stars in fourth
02:33 - line
02:34 - one space and four star in fifth line
02:37 - zero space and
02:38 - five star although stars are having
02:40 - space
02:41 - between these it's not like conservative
02:43 - stars one star then space then star
02:45 - and space like this we have to print so
02:47 - now see
02:49 - how you can relate this in first line
02:51 - you have to print four spaces
02:54 - in second three in third two then one
02:57 - and then
02:57 - zero so now how can you derive a
03:00 - relation or the condition
03:02 - see this should be what number of rows
03:06 - the space should be
03:08 - total number of rows if i say minus
03:12 - the row number minus i
03:15 - that is the condition that should be the
03:17 - condition so for the first
03:19 - line number of rows are hair five
03:22 - and i value is one five minus one that
03:24 - is four
03:25 - means four spaces should be printed
03:27 - first thin star
03:29 - right for second line number of rows 5
03:32 - minus for second line high value is 2
03:35 - and number of spaces should be printed 3
03:38 - yeah
03:39 - that's true right same for next
03:42 - 5 minus i 3 that is two
03:46 - four three two and four next one and it
03:47 - should be zero for the last
03:50 - so we have five we have found out this
03:52 - should be the condition to print space
03:55 - right so for printing space i am just
03:59 - taking this variable name space only i
04:02 - am not taking any
04:03 - k or something like this space is equal
04:05 - to 1
04:06 - and what should be the condition space
04:08 - less than equal to
04:10 - what rows
04:13 - minus i this should be the condition
04:19 - and semicolon we don't have space here
04:21 - so i'm writing this
04:23 - in the next line space my plus plus
04:27 - right and in this loop we are going to
04:30 - print only
04:31 - space that's it
04:35 - now after printing space now we have to
04:37 - print star now for
04:38 - that another for loop within this outer
04:41 - loop only
04:42 - right sorry another for loop not printf
04:45 - and the variable i am taking j j is
04:47 - equal to 1 semicolon j
04:50 - less than equal to now c
04:53 - star or the symbol we are printing in
04:55 - first line
04:56 - only one star second line two star third
04:59 - three star fourth
05:00 - fourth star four star and fifth line
05:02 - five star
05:03 - so i guess you are able to relate the
05:05 - condition here i think you can
05:07 - generalize it and you can find out the
05:09 - condition
05:10 - they should be what less than equal to
05:13 - i because in first line j is executing
05:16 - only once
05:17 - for second row j is executing two times
05:22 - for third j is executing three times
05:25 - means
05:26 - exactly equal to the number of uh
05:29 - that the value of i or the value the
05:31 - value of this row number
05:33 - that that is why j should be less than
05:34 - equal to i
05:37 - and j plus plus and
05:40 - here i am printing what star but
05:44 - what you have to take care here star
05:47 - and space we are printing here so it's
05:50 - not like that only star
05:52 - you should print that would give some
05:53 - another pattern
05:55 - one star and one space here
05:59 - and that is what we are going to print
06:01 - in uh
06:02 - in this printer because see one star
06:05 - then space
06:06 - star then space star then space i hope
06:09 - you can see this right and next is in
06:13 - outer loop we are going to print what
06:14 - one more thing that is new line operator
06:17 - slash
06:18 - now let me run this program and show you
06:21 - see it's starting
06:22 - i would be initialized with 1 1 less
06:26 - than equal to 5 condition true we will
06:27 - enter into this loop
06:29 - now space space
06:32 - is a variable we will initialize it with
06:34 - 1.
06:35 - now see the condition 1 less than equal
06:39 - to
06:39 - rows minus i number of rows how many
06:42 - number of rows here here we are taking
06:44 - number of rows
06:45 - fixed that is 5 right so in this case
06:48 - you can also write
06:49 - 5 minus i or if you want the user should
06:52 - enter the number of rows you want to
06:54 - print so
06:55 - simply you can ask from the user here
06:57 - using printf and scanf
06:59 - [Applause]
07:01 - so user would enter number of rows we
07:03 - are taking a variable name
07:05 - rows we have to declare this variable
07:06 - before using it so now simply
07:09 - yeah in this if you are taking rows so
07:11 - the outer loop would be till
07:15 - number of rows not five i am not going
07:17 - to fix here that is five i am not going
07:19 - to do any hardcoding
07:20 - so we can put here less than equal to uh
07:23 - sorry less than equal to
07:25 - rows right now how many rows suppose i
07:28 - am entering number of rows 5
07:30 - so here 5 minus i high value is 1 5
07:34 - minus 1 that is 4 condition 3
07:38 - yes condition 3 we will enter into this
07:39 - loop and we will print
07:41 - that space here right one space should
07:44 - be printed
07:45 - now space plus plus that is 2 is 2 less
07:48 - than equal to 4 yes condition tree we
07:50 - again enter here print space
07:52 - space plus plus 3 3 less than equal to 4
07:55 - yes condition true again print space
07:58 - space four four less than equal to four
08:00 - yes condition tree again print space
08:03 - space plus plus five now five less than
08:05 - equal to four
08:06 - no condition is not true now exit from
08:09 - this loop
08:10 - now after this for loop immediately
08:12 - after this four we have another for loop
08:14 - that is for j so now j would be
08:17 - initialized with one
08:18 - now here one less than equal to i value
08:20 - is one
08:22 - one less than equal to one yes condition
08:23 - true enter into this loop and print
08:26 - star and space so a star would be
08:29 - printed and one space
08:30 - would be printed now j plus plus j is 2
08:34 - 2 less than equal to 1 no condition is
08:36 - not true exist from this loop and
08:38 - slashing
08:39 - now control would be here next line
08:42 - right now what we are in now outer loop
08:45 - so i plus plus now i becomes 2
08:47 - 2 less than equal to number of rows yes
08:49 - 2 less than equal to 5
08:51 - number of rows are 5 two enter here sp
08:55 - space again would be initialized with
08:58 - one now one less than equal to
09:02 - now see this condition is what rows five
09:05 - minus i value is now 2 5 minus 2 that is
09:08 - 3
09:10 - condition 2 enter here print space
09:14 - space plus plus 2 2 less than equal to 3
09:17 - yes condition tree again print space
09:19 - 3 3 less than equal to 3 again print
09:22 - space
09:23 - now space is 4 4 less than equal to 3 no
09:27 - we are not printing space exit from the
09:28 - slow and now j would be again
09:30 - again initialized with 1 now 1 less than
09:34 - equal to
09:35 - i value is now 2 yes condition true hair
09:38 - prints
09:39 - star and 1 space hair space
09:43 - now j plus plus j is 2 is 2 less than
09:47 - equal to 2
09:48 - yes condition true now again enter here
09:51 - and
09:52 - print one space then here star again one
09:55 - space
09:58 - now j is three now condition is not true
10:00 - exit from this loop slash end now
10:02 - control would be here again
10:04 - i plus plus i hope now you got to
10:06 - working off this
10:07 - these four loops right and finally
10:11 - this pattern will be printed right when
10:14 - i value becomes 4
10:15 - then 5 and ultimately when i value
10:18 - becomes 6
10:19 - now 6 less than equal to number of rows
10:21 - are 5 condition is not true we will exit
10:23 - from this loop
10:24 - right so now let me show you the working
10:27 - of this
10:28 - on my laptop so now let me create
10:31 - one another file for this
10:34 - pattern seven dot c right
10:38 - and i'm going to copy the previous one
10:40 - only i'm not going to write down the
10:42 - complete coding we have to change a
10:44 - little bit only
10:45 - right
10:55 - so now what you have to change here i j
10:58 - number of rows we have to take in this
11:00 - and one more variable that is
11:04 - space right for third loop so first
11:07 - floof would be same
11:08 - i is equal to one i less than equal to
11:10 - number of rows i plus plus and now
11:12 - here one more for loop what for space
11:17 - space is equal to 1 and
11:21 - space less than equal to what the
11:23 - condition is
11:24 - number of rows minus i the row number
11:30 - and what space plus plus
11:33 - right here it should be space
11:39 - now within this for loop what you will
11:41 - print will just print
11:44 - space
11:51 - that's it right and that's it for this
11:55 - now another loop is j j is less j 1 j
11:58 - less than equal to i
11:59 - and j plus plus ok now in this loop what
12:01 - you have to print
12:03 - will just print star
12:08 - star and one space right
12:15 - and printf slash n and that's it now let
12:18 - me run this
12:25 - number of rows you want to print enter 5
12:28 - and the pattern you can see let me run
12:30 - this again
12:32 - for 10 number of rows
12:35 - now here enter 10 and that's it this is
12:38 - the pattern you want exactly
12:40 - right so i hope you got how to print
12:42 - this pattern now that's it for this
12:43 - video i'll see you now in the next video
12:45 - with a new pattern
12:46 - till then bye take care
