00:00 - so in this video I'm going to discuss a
00:01 - very important question that is which
00:04 - programming language you should learn
00:06 - first right because I have been asked
00:09 - many times this type of questions by
00:11 - students like mum which language we
00:15 - should start with right which
00:17 - programming language so see the answer
00:21 - of this question depends on many factors
00:23 - actually I cannot directly say you learn
00:26 - this language first right it depends
00:30 - suppose you are a final layer students
00:32 - right so obviously during your previous
00:35 - year first year second year and third
00:36 - year you have learned how both you have
00:38 - gone through that C C++ and Java and.net
00:40 - also right but you are not exporting
00:42 - those languages you have just read out
00:45 - those languages just to pass out the
00:47 - semester that's it right but now you
00:50 - really want to learn a programming
00:52 - language you really want to you know get
00:54 - a good placement or something like this
00:56 - now you want to be expert in one
00:58 - language right so at this point of time
01:01 - obviously during final year you know in
01:04 - which field you really want to go right
01:08 - obviously you want to learn a
01:10 - programming language so you be you wanna
01:12 - be a developer software developer right
01:14 - but there also many kind of jobs are
01:18 - there right like web development jobs
01:21 - are there and I guess more than 50% jobs
01:25 - are off you know job openings are for
01:27 - web development right there also we have
01:31 - multiple type of designation you can say
01:34 - full stack web developer or back-end or
01:37 - front-end developer or you can say
01:39 - desktop developer or you can say mobile
01:41 - app developer these kind of things and
01:44 - many I have also seen these kind of
01:47 - posting like machine learning developer
01:48 - nowadays right so now you have to decide
01:52 - in which field you wanna you really
01:54 - wanna go right if you really want to go
01:56 - in web development I would suggest you
01:59 - go for JavaScript for web applications
02:02 - it is the best you know programming
02:05 - language to learn that is JavaScript
02:07 - obviously with this when you are going
02:10 - to design a website when you are going
02:11 - to into this field where please
02:13 - then obviously you need one HTML plus
02:16 - CSS these are not we cannot say that
02:20 - these are programming languages but
02:21 - these are very simple to learn the
02:23 - programming language you should learn is
02:24 - JavaScript now the point is see website
02:29 - obviously these are basically for word
02:31 - you can say that for the decoration of
02:33 - the website and to add the functionality
02:35 - to that website we use JavaScript right
02:38 - now obviously to you know build a great
02:41 - website like many other website you can
02:45 - say like Facebook you can say so there
02:47 - you they need to store the data also so
02:49 - you need a back-end right so nowadays
02:52 - what happens for that thing they require
02:56 - what if a job opening is for back-end
02:59 - developer so they can say they'll
03:01 - require what JavaScript plus node.js
03:04 - right or JavaScript plus angularjs these
03:09 - kind of things right so the point is if
03:11 - you are ongoing web development just to
03:13 - go for JavaScript right now if you wanna
03:17 - go in you know iOS you can say app you
03:22 - wanna develop any app mobile apps right
03:24 - so obviously for iOS and for Android for
03:31 - iOS you must go for Swift objective-c is
03:36 - also there with Swift but objective-c is
03:39 - now out of scope you can say this is now
03:41 - gaining importance right this is the
03:44 - emerging language so you should go for
03:47 - Swift if you wanna go for Android hard
03:50 - development then you can say that here
03:54 - Java and code link comes into picture
03:57 - see Java is everywhere fine but it is
04:02 - little bit difficult to understand
04:04 - initially if you are beginner and if you
04:08 - want to choose the first programming
04:09 - language to learn so it would be
04:11 - difficult for you right and cooling is
04:14 - you know gaining importance nowadays so
04:16 - you can go for this also right but this
04:18 - is also not very simple to learn this is
04:21 - also tough right
04:23 - this fact I'm you know discussing the
04:26 - which is on which factor that if you
04:28 - have decided in which field you really
04:31 - wanna go right now suppose if you want
04:34 - to go for game development then
04:38 - definitely you can choose c plus plus or
04:42 - c-sharp and next is what if you really
04:45 - want to go in you know you can say that
04:47 - the data science or data engineering or
04:49 - machine learning in that case i would
04:54 - suggest go for python python r matlab
04:59 - these kind of languages are there but
05:01 - this is very simple so you should choose
05:03 - this one to learn first python these
05:06 - kind of machine learning is also you
05:08 - know these kind of field is also in
05:11 - trending nowadays c as you have seen
05:13 - that this language the python has you
05:16 - know gradually increased and nowadays it
05:20 - is the most popular language right plus
05:25 - another factor with this is what it is
05:27 - easy to learn i cannot say that super
05:30 - easy to learn but yeah
05:31 - as compared to C C++ Java and any other
05:36 - language it is easy to learn right so if
05:41 - you haven't decided that if you are not
05:43 - sure in which fill you really wanna go
05:45 - right so I would suggest you must go for
05:50 - Python because I feel the first
05:56 - programming language you learn that
06:00 - should be you know easy if the first
06:03 - programming language is stuff you
06:05 - suppose you choose C is all sort of C++
06:07 - is stuff Java is all sort of if you
06:09 - choose these kind of languages then
06:12 - maybe you will you know you will get
06:13 - frustrated after some days because these
06:16 - are not so easy to learn and then you
06:19 - will you know lose your confidence and
06:22 - you will lose your interest in learning
06:24 - programming languages right you will
06:27 - lose your interest in programming so
06:30 - better choose Python to learn first if
06:33 - you don't know in which will you really
06:35 - wanna go and if you are a beginner so
06:38 - first language
06:39 - their own if you really wanna learn a
06:41 - programming language by yourself if you
06:43 - are really interested then go for Python
06:45 - right another factor is what you can go
06:51 - according to the you know the market
06:53 - trend the job market fine and I have
06:57 - already the search about this thing like
06:59 - the most popular languages Java so now I
07:05 - would suggest either you go for Python
07:09 - or JavaScript first these two languages
07:12 - right but obviously in universities they
07:16 - teach you C then C++ in general like
07:20 - this so you can say that these languages
07:24 - you can say see is what grandparent for
07:27 - all other high level languages and if
07:30 - you have learnt C then it will be easy
07:33 - for you to switch to C++ and if you know
07:36 - C++ then it would be super easy for you
07:40 - to jump into Java and other any language
07:45 - because these are if you know the C++
07:48 - language very well then you can easily
07:50 - learn any other language right but these
07:55 - are very difficult to understand you
07:58 - know at starting maybe you will get
08:00 - frustrated if you are not getting the
08:02 - syntax and all of these kinds of
08:04 - languages the hoops concept and
08:06 - everything right so here I want to add
08:09 - one more point for a solid foundation
08:14 - for a solid base in programming
08:16 - languages you must go for these
08:19 - languages you can go in this path C then
08:22 - C++ then Java right and Java is the most
08:26 - popular language it has everywhere fine
08:30 - in most of the job openings you will see
08:33 - that they will the requirement is what
08:35 - Java C Python is the most popular
08:39 - language nowadays but it's not like that
08:41 - C++ and Java these are out of scope if
08:44 - you really want to go in big tech
08:46 - companies they still work on C++ and
08:50 - Java the big giant come
08:53 - and here one more important point is
08:55 - what if you want to go in development
08:57 - field and you have suppose you are
08:59 - expert in one language so it's not like
09:01 - that you are done because developers you
09:03 - know should eventually learn more than
09:05 - one programming language and if you are
09:08 - exporting one programming language the
09:11 - advantage is what now you can learn any
09:14 - other language easy maybe for learning
09:17 - the first language you will require two
09:19 - months three months four months like
09:21 - this for learning the next language you
09:24 - will require less time maybe two month
09:28 - or three month like this right so in
09:32 - short if you are decided in which field
09:35 - you really wanna go just go according to
09:38 - these languages otherwise if you are a
09:40 - beginner you don't know anything so just
09:43 - you can just learn and if you want to
09:46 - learn a simple language right so just go
09:50 - for Python if you really want to build
09:52 - build a solid base then you can go for
09:55 - these type of languages write C++ and
09:58 - Java fine so that's it for this video I
10:02 - hope you I have answered this question I
10:05 - have tried my best best ones of this
10:07 - question based on different factors
10:09 - now most probably next video I am going
10:12 - to make a video on the topic like top
10:14 - five programming languages too long
10:16 - nowadays right so now I'll see in the
10:19 - next video till then bye bye take care
