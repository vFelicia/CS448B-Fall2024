00:00 - computer science when you hear this word
00:02 - computer science what comes in your mind
00:03 - first
00:04 - programming coding uh programming
00:06 - languages
00:07 - but there are other subjects also in
00:08 - computer science operating system
00:10 - database
00:11 - uh data structure computer networks and
00:13 - many more
00:14 - but what do you think generally it's all
00:16 - about programming computer science is
00:18 - all about programming but that is a myth
00:20 - in the previous video also i have
00:22 - discussed myths about computer
00:23 - programming
00:24 - myths about computer science you can
00:25 - check out this that video in the side
00:26 - button
00:27 - right it's not all about programming but
00:29 - yeah programming is you can say it's in
00:31 - it's an important aspect of computer
00:33 - science degree yeah that is true we
00:35 - cannot deny this
00:36 - but it is not like that if you are a cs
00:38 - degree holder you can only be a program
00:39 - and you can only
00:40 - go into the development field like
00:42 - software developer web developer
00:44 - or mobile app developer but if you are
00:45 - not good in programming then
00:47 - maybe you are thinking that it's not for
00:49 - me i cannot i'm not able to get a job
00:51 - i'm not able to get a good job because
00:52 - i'm not going programming but no that is
00:54 - not true
00:55 - that also i'll discuss if you are not
00:57 - good in programming if you hate coding
00:59 - what are the other options for you guys
01:01 - but in a later video right in this video
01:04 - i'm going to discuss
01:05 - some must have skills for computer
01:07 - science students or
01:09 - i can say skills you should develop
01:12 - during your college time
01:13 - when you are pursuing your degree at
01:16 - that time
01:16 - right but before that just want to tell
01:19 - you one thing
01:19 - an academy is presenting you an
01:22 - exclusive interview with all india rank
01:24 - 1 holder jrf 2020 and this interview is
01:28 - on 14th of december you can check out
01:30 - the detail here one of their educator is
01:32 - going to interview
01:33 - that all india rank one holder and in
01:35 - this interview uh
01:36 - she she'll be discussing about her
01:39 - journey
01:40 - and her preparation strategy as well as
01:42 - uh she'll discuss
01:44 - she'll give some tips and tricks that is
01:46 - definitely going to be helpful
01:48 - for the aspirants preparing for nta ugc
01:51 - net exam

02:43 - exclusive interview i'll put in the
02:45 - description box of this video you can go
02:47 - and check out
02:48 - so now let us discuss those skills which
02:50 - you should develop during your college
02:52 - time during
02:52 - you when you are pursuing your degree
02:55 - first is definitely
02:56 - that is programming skill right because
02:58 - see it is in your curriculum also the
03:00 - subject
03:01 - c c plus plus java and other subjects
03:03 - also dsa you have
03:05 - practicals also you have to write down
03:07 - programs also so
03:09 - it's better to develop your programming
03:10 - skill it's better to work on your
03:12 - programming skill from the first
03:14 - semester only from the first year only
03:16 - right because it is really going to
03:18 - helpful in future
03:19 - but see suppose you have tried very hard
03:22 - but still you are not very good in
03:24 - programming
03:24 - at least obviously you have some
03:26 - fundamentals are clear you have some
03:28 - idea of the languages
03:29 - but you are not so strong it's fine you
03:32 - can go into other field also
03:34 - but if you work on your programming
03:36 - skill yeah you have time
03:38 - please don't give up work on your
03:40 - programming skill and
03:42 - how to learn a programming language how
03:43 - to think logic how to learn to code
03:45 - these videos i have already uploaded
03:48 - so you can check out these videos in the
03:50 - playlist placement series
03:52 - right second point is self learning
03:55 - you have to be a self learner see if you
03:58 - will ask um
03:59 - to your seniors those are already in
04:01 - those companies in some big companies or
04:03 - in any companies or those who have
04:05 - already placed
04:06 - or if you will survey or you will do
04:08 - some research then
04:10 - you will find out that whatever you
04:12 - study during your degree
04:14 - in the classroom that is not much
04:17 - beneficial
04:18 - for you when you go for when you work
04:20 - when you work actually in that
04:22 - industry right you can ask to your
04:24 - seniors if they are working there
04:26 - like how much if they have what they
04:29 - whatever they have studied during their
04:30 - cs degree in the classroom
04:32 - how much it is useful and you will be
04:34 - surprised to get the answer
04:36 - it is very less right because they focus
04:39 - more on what
04:40 - yeah generally in their classroom they
04:42 - focus more on what
04:43 - theory rather than practical yeah you
04:45 - have practicals also
04:47 - but they focus on theory they evaluate
04:49 - you based on your theory
04:50 - right so but you have you should have
04:53 - practical
04:54 - knowledge rather than theoretical
04:56 - knowledge that is going to be
04:57 - important that is going to be helpful
04:59 - when you will get a job when you will
05:01 - actually work
05:02 - in that environment in real time
05:04 - environment right
05:05 - like the in colleges they will not teach
05:07 - you how to develop a mobile app how to
05:10 - uh
05:10 - create a website right they just only
05:13 - teach you the theoretical subjects
05:14 - these are the programs in the labs and
05:17 - you just write the programs and
05:18 - that's it but what is the true meaning
05:20 - of writing those program what is the
05:21 - true meaning of learning these languages
05:23 - so that you do yourself you have to be a
05:27 - self-learner specially yeah it is also
05:29 - very important it is also important in
05:31 - any other
05:32 - streams in any other branch also but in
05:35 - computer science it is
05:36 - very important so my advice is what
05:39 - please do not be just
05:40 - dependent on your coursework on your
05:43 - faculties
05:43 - in classroom like they have taught this
05:46 - to you
05:47 - and that's it you have revised those
05:49 - concept
05:50 - right you have past semester exam you
05:52 - have passed your practical and that's it
05:54 - no you have to be a self-learner you
05:56 - have to research
05:58 - you have to do some research about the
05:59 - trends what is in market what is going
06:01 - on in market what skills
06:03 - technologies uh what tools and
06:05 - technologies what skills
06:07 - required are required to get into
06:09 - companies how they work
06:11 - the working environment of companies and
06:13 - for that obviously you should have some
06:14 - connections also
06:16 - with your seniors like this so it's
06:18 - better to make connections also
06:20 - while you are you know in your college
06:22 - so that you can get some information
06:23 - about those companies their working
06:25 - environment their culture and everything
06:27 - and it would be beneficial for you if
06:28 - you have prior knowledge of these things
06:30 - because
06:31 - if you want to get into these companies
06:33 - so definitely it would be beneficial for
06:34 - you
06:35 - so please make a habit of self learning
06:38 - you have to be a self learner that is
06:40 - very important
06:41 - right next is critical thinking
06:44 - see identifying a problem check out
06:47 - every single detail every minor detail
06:50 - of that problem
06:51 - then finding out the solutions analyzing
06:54 - those solutions
06:55 - and then finding out the optimized
06:56 - solution effective solution for a
06:58 - problem
06:59 - right it is what it's an important
07:01 - aspects
07:02 - in computer science so for that you have
07:04 - to be a critical thinker
07:06 - you have to be a problem solver you have
07:08 - to develop these critical thinking
07:10 - ability in you this problem solving
07:11 - activity in you
07:13 - so that you can if you have given a
07:14 - problem you can identify that problem
07:16 - first of all understand that problem
07:18 - every single details then find out the
07:21 - solutions and give optimized solution
07:23 - not just give solution but you have to
07:26 - analyze those solutions also
07:27 - you have to give an effective optimized
07:29 - solution right
07:31 - next is teamwork see this is also very
07:35 - important
07:35 - when you go into these industries
07:39 - it's not like that if you are working on
07:41 - a project i alone will
07:42 - do that project i don't need any team if
07:45 - in case of president
07:46 - presentation also i also i alone will
07:49 - give this presentation i don't need
07:50 - anyone
07:51 - if it's come to publishing a research
07:53 - paper then also
07:55 - i'll only publish the research paper
07:57 - means i don't need anyone i'll not add
07:59 - any other's name i don't need any others
08:01 - help that should not be your attitude
08:03 - they also think
08:04 - that you have that ability to work in a
08:08 - team
08:08 - while interviewing because at that time
08:10 - you have to work in a team
08:12 - on a project you have to collaborate
08:14 - with other members you have to
08:15 - communicate with other members also
08:17 - you have to live in that environment in
08:19 - a team work environment
08:21 - so that should be in you like you can
08:23 - work in a team so you should work
08:25 - on this skill also you should start
08:27 - developing the skills also during your
08:29 - college time
08:30 - like uh if you are working on a project
08:32 - there is a team of
08:33 - three to four members so obviously you
08:35 - are man maybe you are managing that team
08:38 - some tasks it is your task that you have
08:39 - to do this in
08:41 - in this project other member is going to
08:43 - do is working on this part
08:45 - so you have to communicate with other
08:46 - members also while giving presentation
08:48 - also you can
08:50 - make a group or you can do group study
08:52 - also
08:53 - or if you are going to publish a
08:55 - research paper then also maybe
08:56 - two members three or four students can
08:59 - work
09:00 - in a team and publish a research paper
09:02 - that would be easy
09:03 - rather than publishing a research paper
09:05 - rather than
09:06 - working on a project rather than giving
09:08 - a presentation with no team member
09:10 - right so start working in a team
09:15 - next is patience i don't know if you are
09:17 - able to relate this or not but
09:19 - i am i'll try to explain with some
09:21 - examples like see
09:22 - suppose if you are working on a project
09:24 - or not project you suppose you are
09:25 - writing a program
09:26 - very basically from the very basic level
09:28 - i am going to start
09:29 - and it is starting if when you are
09:32 - starting to do that code when you are
09:35 - learning code
09:36 - in starting phase what you do even you
09:38 - do a mistake of like
09:40 - missing a semicolon and you are not able
09:43 - to find out
09:45 - this also this is silly mistake and you
09:47 - will end up with you know
09:48 - scratching your head and you will not
09:52 - able to write a simple program how to
09:54 - check even odd numbers
09:56 - have to write down those syntaxes for
09:58 - loop syntax
10:00 - these things maybe sometimes you cannot
10:02 - even write
10:03 - like that in c language printf syntax or
10:06 - scanf syntax somewhere you forgot to
10:09 - write down that quotation mark that
10:10 - percentage and
10:12 - these syntaxes so you have to be
10:15 - cool at that time keep and keep on
10:17 - coding right
10:18 - so this skill is also required for a
10:21 - computer science student
10:23 - you have to keep patience like suppose
10:25 - let us take
10:26 - example of competitive programming
10:28 - sometimes
10:29 - you face such type of problem
10:32 - like obviously in competitive
10:35 - programming problems are in form of
10:36 - stories you have to first understand the
10:38 - problem
10:39 - right and then you give the solution so
10:42 - sometimes it
10:43 - took two days three days to solve that
10:46 - problem
10:47 - right so at that time you need patience
10:50 - so that's it from my side but if you
10:52 - think that for a cs student
10:54 - other than these skills some other
10:55 - skills are also uh
10:57 - necessary to develop during their
10:58 - college time then you can write down
11:00 - those skills in the comment box
11:02 - so now that's it for this video i'll see
11:04 - in the next video now till then bye take
11:06 - care
