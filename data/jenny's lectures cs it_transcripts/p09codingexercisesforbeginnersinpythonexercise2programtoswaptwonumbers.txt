00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:02 - video we have discussed
00:05 - variables in python right how to use
00:07 - variables how to declare variables why
00:10 - we need variables what are variables
00:11 - everything with the help of a program
00:13 - and a coding exercise
00:15 - now in this video we will see a program
00:17 - actually or we can see it would be a
00:19 - coding exercise for you guys you have to
00:21 - swap two numbers
00:23 - right
00:24 - so this is the case
00:26 - it should be on your output screen like
00:28 - enter value of a you will enter any
00:30 - value like 1 then interval b 2 after
00:33 - swapping you should print a equal to 2 b
00:35 - equal to 1 thus it should print on the
00:37 - screen
00:39 - so i think you can
00:41 - basically please don't you know search
00:43 - the logic of swapping and all think
00:45 - about us let's take a real life example
00:47 - if you have two glasses
00:50 - in one glass i have suppose milk and in
00:53 - another glass i have tea
00:56 - fine now you have to
00:59 - swap these things these
01:01 - uh coffee and sorry milk and coffee milk
01:04 - and tea
01:06 - so what you can
01:08 - you know what should be the thing what
01:09 - you will you will i know how you will
01:11 - exchange
01:12 - these two things
01:14 - maybe probably we will take third
01:15 - container there you can exchange like
01:18 - milk you can exchange in that thing in
01:20 - milk container now you can put that tea
01:23 - now and from the third container
01:26 - you can put that milk to this t
01:29 - i hope you got this logic
01:32 - in real life how you will do that thing
01:33 - please think about this and same logic
01:36 - you have to apply
01:37 - this swapping of two numbers suppose to
01:39 - swap two numbers you have to take
01:40 - another container or you can say
01:42 - variable that's it
01:43 - so let's try this out pause the video
01:45 - and try this out after that we'll see
01:47 - the solution so let's create a new file
01:50 - here
01:50 - click on new file and
01:54 - swap
01:56 - underscore sorry swap underscore numbers
01:59 - i'm taking this name
02:01 - numbers dot p y
02:04 - it should be dot dot p y not hyphen or
02:07 - anything
02:08 - okay
02:09 - so now we'll
02:11 - take input
02:13 - and
02:15 - enter value of
02:17 - a that should be printed printed on the
02:19 - screen right so whatever you will enter
02:21 - that we are going to store in a variable
02:23 - obviously so that we can use in future
02:27 - so in a
02:28 - i am using i am storing that
02:31 - now in b what we do
02:34 - again input function and here i am
02:37 - writing enter
02:39 - value of b
02:41 - okay
02:43 - so now
02:45 - a and b now we have to swap these
02:47 - numbers so one hint i have given you
02:50 - that we have to take another variable
02:52 - for this thing suppose i am taking
02:54 - another variable temp or any variable
02:56 - name you can take
02:58 - so in temp first of all i am storing
03:01 - a value of a
03:03 - okay now in a
03:05 - i'm storing value of
03:07 - b
03:08 - and in b i'm storing value of
03:12 - temp
03:14 - fine
03:16 - i hope you got this logic
03:20 - if you got the real life example
03:23 - now simply we have done the swapping now
03:26 - simply you have to print so print we
03:28 - will print
03:30 - a equal to this string should be printed
03:33 - on the screen a equal to and now value
03:35 - of a now value of a is in k this
03:38 - a variable
03:40 - so simply we cannot write down a
03:43 - no
03:44 - in python we cannot do this thing it
03:46 - will give error see
03:48 - it is giving an error suppose i run this
03:50 - program
03:51 - and what is your name sorry it is
03:54 - actually running another program let's
03:56 - just right click this and swap run swap
03:58 - numbers see it is giving syntax error
04:02 - invalid syntax perhaps you forgot comma
04:06 - so here in print a equal to this this
04:08 - thing in line number seven it is syntax
04:10 - error you cannot write down this in
04:13 - this
04:14 - python
04:16 - here i'm just concatenating using plus
04:19 - i'm concatenating these two strings so
04:21 - you can use comma also
04:24 - next print
04:25 - uh
04:26 - b is equal to
04:29 - plus and whatever the value in b that
04:32 - i'm writing okay
04:34 - so i'm concatenating these things so
04:37 - rather than this you can use formula
04:38 - also rather than plus
04:40 - let's run this and see what output you
04:42 - will get so interval of a 1
04:45 - b 2
04:47 - see after swapping it is printing a is
04:49 - equal to 2 and b is equal to
04:51 - 1
04:52 - we have swapped these things
04:55 - same one concept i want to tell you
04:57 - this is a string
04:59 - because it is in these codes plus
05:02 - plus is used to concatenate strings
05:05 - a a is what you will say a is what a
05:07 - number integer
05:09 - a is 1
05:10 - or after swapping is 2 so how can you
05:12 - concatenate these two things string with
05:14 - an integer
05:16 - same explanation is what i hope you got
05:19 - the answer if you got just let me know
05:20 - in comment section
05:22 - if you haven't got this thing let me
05:24 - just tell you
05:25 - input function
05:26 - we are taking this a from this input
05:29 - function input function so input
05:31 - function by default we will return
05:33 - string
05:34 - so whatever you will enter
05:36 - whether it's an integer for you one two
05:38 - three four five
05:39 - it would be considered as a string
05:42 - this b value doth because would also be
05:44 - considered as a string so now a is also
05:47 - string the value is also string by
05:48 - default
05:49 - so string plus string we can concatenate
05:52 - these two things
05:54 - okay and rather than this plus you can
05:55 - use comma also
05:58 - i hope you got this exercise
06:01 - or if you haven't got let me just tell
06:03 - you the explanation part so you can
06:06 - continue watching this video if you
06:08 - haven't got the explanation part of this
06:09 - thing so let's see the explanation step
06:12 - by step
06:14 - first thing okay this will be executed
06:16 - input enter value of a we have a
06:18 - variable a in memory
06:20 - some memory would be allocated to this a
06:23 - whatever you will enter one i have
06:25 - entered that will be stored here now
06:26 - another variable is b we have entered
06:28 - two two will be stored here now we have
06:30 - taken another variable temp so we have
06:31 - one more variable temp or you can say
06:34 - third container we have
06:36 - in temp i am assigning a value a value
06:38 - is 1 so in temp now we have 1 now in a i
06:41 - am assigning b value so whatever b 2
06:44 - that would be assigned to a now this
06:45 - becomes
06:46 - 2. now in b we are assigning temp value
06:50 - now in b we are assigning temp value in
06:51 - temp we have 1 so now 1 would be
06:54 - assigned to this b
06:55 - you can see now you can print now a that
06:58 - will be printed 2 and in b now we have 1
07:01 - so this was simple logic
07:03 - okay
07:04 - as these are variables so you can we can
07:06 - these very values can be valid we can
07:09 - change the values that's why it we are
07:11 - able to change the values of a and b and
07:12 - temp because these are variables these
07:14 - are not constraints
07:16 - fine
07:17 - so i guess that's it for this video this
07:19 - was very simple i guess you got it now
07:21 - the next video will see you know some
07:22 - rules there are some rules to name
07:24 - variables
07:26 - so those things will see in the next
07:27 - video now see the next video till then
07:28 - bye take care
