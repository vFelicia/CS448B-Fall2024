00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:02 - c we are discussing printing pattern
00:03 - programs in c
00:04 - so in this video i will talk about how
00:06 - to print this pattern we will see the
00:07 - logic first of all this
00:09 - on this whiteboard then i'll show you
00:10 - the output on my laptop
00:12 - right now what is the first thing
00:14 - identify the number of rows and number
00:16 - of columns how many number of rows you
00:17 - want to print here
00:19 - 5 and which loop is responsible the
00:23 - outer loop
00:23 - generally we take i the name of the
00:26 - variable is i
00:27 - i 1 here i value is 2 then 3 then 4 then
00:31 - 5
00:32 - right these are for number of rows
00:35 - and these are number of
00:38 - columns j j is equal to 1
00:42 - this for 2 then 3 then 4 then
00:46 - 5. now let's see how to write down the
00:49 - logic here
00:51 - first the outer loop that is i is equal
00:54 - to 1 and
00:55 - i less than equal to 5 that's it because
00:58 - it is to print number of lines
00:59 - number of lines should be 5 whenever i
01:01 - value becomes 6 just stop
01:03 - so i should be less than equal to 5
01:04 - that's it now
01:08 - inner loop j now j is equal to 1
01:11 - and here what should be the condition j
01:14 - less than equal to
01:15 - 1 see when i value is 1 j should be
01:18 - executed only one time
01:20 - here two time three times four time and
01:23 - five time
01:24 - changing it's changing right so when i
01:26 - value is 1
01:27 - j is executing only once i value is 2 j
01:30 - is executing
01:31 - 2 2 times when i is 3
01:34 - j is executing 3 times here 4 times 5
01:37 - times
01:38 - so i hope you are able to relate i and j
01:41 - right
01:42 - so i can put what j less than equal to i
01:46 - whatever the value of phi j should be
01:48 - repeated that time only
01:50 - right j less than equal to i and j plus
01:53 - plus
01:54 - now here what we will print c
01:58 - now here obviously it is some integer
02:00 - value so percentage d
02:02 - now what i'll print here i cannot print
02:04 - i if you print i
02:05 - we have discussed in the previous video
02:07 - what output you will get one
02:09 - two two three three four four four like
02:10 - this if you write down here
02:13 - j then what output you will get one one
02:15 - two one two three one two three four
02:17 - both the patterns we have discussed
02:19 - neither i am nor
02:21 - j we can print so what hair i can print
02:24 - let's take another variable named
02:28 - number any number sorry
02:31 - variable name is number or abc or
02:34 - anything you can take
02:35 - y z right and i am initializing here
02:39 - obviously in the program i'm not writing
02:40 - here the complete program i'll show the
02:42 - complete program on my laptop
02:43 - well i should initialize i j and what
02:47 - a variable number and number i'm
02:49 - initializing with 1 because i am going
02:51 - to start
02:52 - i am going to print the value from 1
02:55 - if here 0 1 2 3 4 5 like this then we
02:59 - can
02:59 - initialize it with 0 right
03:02 - but here i am printing from one so
03:04 - number should be printed here
03:07 - but at first number is one so one would
03:09 - be printed
03:10 - now next time two should be printed now
03:13 - three then four then five then six
03:16 - means what her number should be
03:18 - incremented
03:19 - by one after printing number should be
03:22 - incremented because next time
03:23 - incremented value should be printed so
03:26 - here
03:26 - after printing you can just write down
03:29 - number plus plus
03:31 - or you can write down plus plus number
03:33 - same thing
03:34 - here right and that's it for the inner
03:38 - loop
03:38 - now in outer loop what slash
03:42 - and that's it now see the working i
03:44 - value is
03:46 - 1 1 less than equal to 5
03:49 - yes condition true we will enter into
03:51 - this loop now j value is
03:53 - 1 1 and i value is 1
03:57 - so 1 less than equal to 1 yes condition
03:59 - tree we will enter here
04:00 - number will be printed whatever the
04:02 - number number is
04:04 - one right so one would be printed on
04:06 - your computer screen
04:08 - right now number plus plus
04:11 - right now number becomes here c
04:14 - when the program would be done then in
04:17 - memory number would be there that is
04:19 - the value is 1 right now number plus
04:23 - plus now this value becomes 2
04:25 - number plus plus right
04:29 - now j plus plus j becomes 2 is 2 less
04:32 - than equal to i
04:33 - 2 less than equal to 1 no condition is
04:35 - not true exit from this inner loop slash
04:38 - n
04:38 - so control will be in the next line now
04:41 - i plus plus
04:43 - is this condition true 2 less than equal
04:45 - to 5 yes we will again enter into this
04:47 - loop j will be initialized with 1 again
04:50 - now 1 and i value is not 2
04:54 - 1 is less than equal to 2 yes condition
04:55 - 2 will again enter here and number will
04:57 - be printed now the
04:58 - value of number is 2 so now 2 would be
05:02 - printed here
05:03 - right and again number plus plus so now
05:05 - number becomes
05:06 - 3 now j plus plus j becomes 2
05:11 - 2 less than equal to 2 yes condition 2
05:13 - will again enter into this loop number
05:15 - will be printed now number is 3 so 3
05:17 - would be printed
05:19 - now again number plus plus number
05:20 - becomes 4
05:22 - now again j plus plus j is 3 is 3 less
05:25 - than equal to 2
05:26 - no exit from this loop now slasher means
05:29 - control will be here
05:31 - i plus plus now i becomes 3 now
05:33 - condition is still true
05:35 - and this process would be repeated again
05:37 - until the outer loop
05:39 - the this condition is false right so now
05:42 - i hope
05:42 - uh you got how to print this pattern
05:44 - right now let me show you this
05:46 - output on my computer screen so now let
05:49 - me create another file
05:51 - named pattern 6.3
05:54 - right and i'm going to copy the previous
05:58 - code because it's almost
05:59 - same we have to what change
06:03 - a little bit so no need to write down
06:06 - it is it's you can say uh saving of our
06:10 - time
06:10 - number of rows okay fine in the loop
06:13 - would be
06:14 - say my less than equal to j less than
06:16 - equal to i j plus plus now what you will
06:18 - print here we are printing what
06:20 - a number here you can say
06:24 - number or any variable name you can take
06:25 - right and let me
06:28 - just declare number because we cannot
06:31 - directly use any variable you have to
06:33 - declare and
06:35 - what the what
06:39 - the value is number is equal to 1 i'm
06:41 - initializing with
06:43 - 1 right and let's do
06:46 - number plus plus or you can do
06:49 - a plus plus number here both are same
06:53 - and that's it now let me run this
06:58 - see enter number of rows 5
07:01 - and that's it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and
07:04 - like this now if you run this again
07:08 - for 7 rows or 10 rows whatever number
07:11 - you want to
07:12 - print you can enter suppose i am writing
07:14 - here seven rows
07:17 - so you are getting seven rows so now i
07:19 - hope you got how to print this pattern
07:21 - now i'll see you in the next video with
07:23 - a new pattern
07:24 - till then bye take care
