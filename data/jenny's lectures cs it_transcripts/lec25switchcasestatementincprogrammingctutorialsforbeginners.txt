00:00 - so in the series of learning c plus plus
00:01 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - control structures in c plus plus now we
00:05 - have discussed if if else lc flat error
00:07 - is necessary now one that is left is
00:09 - switch case statement that we'll be
00:11 - discussing in this video see when we're
00:12 - discussing elsif letter uh statement in
00:15 - that video i have told you this program
00:17 - we can do with the help of a switch case
00:19 - statement here we have multiple
00:21 - conditions you write else if else if
00:24 - then condition else if then again
00:25 - condition else if then again condition
00:27 - multiple conditions we have multiple you
00:29 - can see choices we have and you have to
00:30 - select one
00:32 - right
00:33 - so in that case you can use you can
00:36 - write down this program with the help of
00:37 - switch case statement and if you write
00:39 - this with the help of switch case
00:40 - statement that would be more readable
00:41 - program and
00:42 - probably will have less number of lines
00:44 - of code than this
00:46 - right so now what is this switch case
00:48 - statement why we use it how to use it
00:51 - with the help of a program i will show
00:52 - you everything every single detail about
00:54 - switch case statement
00:56 - right some important points also so
00:58 - we'll be discussing in this video all
01:00 - the things but before this one tell you
01:02 - one thing these four weeks is coming up
01:04 - with an event skill dependence days from
01:06 - 13th to 15th of august
01:08 - so the aim of this event is to be skill
01:10 - dependent keep learning and keep growing
01:14 - it is a three days sale
01:16 - during these days you will get flat 15
01:19 - percent site-wide discount on the entire
01:21 - website of these services you will get
01:23 - flat 15 percent discount
01:25 - and offer of the days are also there
01:26 - during these uh three days
01:28 - those are on 13th of august you will get
01:30 - 20 discount on complete interview
01:34 - preparation course on 14th of august you
01:36 - will get 20 discount on all seven live
01:40 - courses and on 15th of august
01:43 - on bsa self-paced course you will get 20
01:47 - discount so this is an opportunity for
01:50 - you guys to grab the courses you want at
01:52 - best price and best offers so mark your
01:55 - calendars
01:56 - and participate in the event so all the
01:57 - relevant links and detail you will find
01:59 - in the description box of this video you
02:01 - can go and check out now let's see what
02:03 - is switch case statement so as i have
02:05 - told you this is what you can say is a
02:07 - substitute of that long if else
02:10 - statement else if letter lc plc fails
02:12 - offensive so you can substitute that
02:15 - thing with the help of switch case
02:16 - statement
02:17 - right
02:18 - see
02:19 - as you can see uh we have multiple
02:22 - switches like
02:23 - on the board one switches off fan if you
02:25 - switch on that press that switch
02:28 - your fan would be turned on one is for
02:30 - light one is for another light one is
02:32 - maybe for you know ac different
02:34 - difference which we have so whatever
02:37 - switch you will press
02:39 - according to that
02:41 - the you know task would be done the
02:43 - associated task to that switch would be
02:45 - done maybe fan would be turned on maybe
02:47 - ac would be on maybe light would be on
02:49 - whatever task would be associated to
02:51 - that switch right so we have multiple
02:53 - choices we have multiple choices here
02:56 - right you can switch on the fan or the
02:57 - light or according to your need
03:00 - right same
03:02 - during your program when we write
03:04 - program we may be we have multiple
03:05 - choices and depending on a condition we
03:07 - have to choose
03:09 - we have to select one or maybe two it
03:11 - depends on the requirements
03:13 - right that thing also will discuss later
03:16 - once basics are clear right
03:18 - once the main reason of using switch
03:20 - case statement is clear to you guys
03:22 - right
03:24 - so multiple choices you have you have to
03:25 - select one
03:27 - right
03:29 - in that case we can use switch case
03:31 - statement now how to write down this
03:33 - thing
03:34 - see
03:35 - simply we write
03:37 - this switch
03:38 - and here we write expression
03:41 - now this expression
03:44 - should be evaluated in a constant value
03:49 - integral value you can say
03:51 - right
03:53 - so
03:54 - whatever the expression the valid
03:56 - expression can be what that also will
03:58 - see first of all let me just try down
04:00 - the syntax
04:01 - switch expression you will write here
04:03 - right then we write case
04:07 - case and here
04:10 - the value of the case
04:12 - right or the
04:13 - label of that case
04:15 - right i am writing here value
04:17 - suppose value 1
04:19 - right
04:21 - now
04:22 - the colon
04:24 - and then the statement you want to
04:25 - execute
04:28 - fine
04:29 - suppose i am writing
04:31 - block of statements 1 and and
04:36 - break
04:38 - y break
04:39 - that also will see
04:41 - next again case
04:43 - value 2
04:44 - right
04:45 - then we can say block of statements 2
04:49 - and break
04:52 - like this multiple cases you can have
04:54 - one or many number of cases as you want
04:56 - right
04:57 - so suppose case
04:59 - and we have value n
05:02 - then
05:07 - and at last we have a default case
05:12 - default and
05:13 - same colon
05:16 - and
05:18 - default statement
05:23 - that's it
05:25 - if you want to write down you can write
05:26 - down break also in default
05:29 - right but it is not necessary to write
05:30 - down break and default and when it is
05:33 - compulsory to write down break in
05:34 - default also that case also will be
05:36 - discussing so this is a general syntax
05:38 - of writing a switch case statement right
05:42 - so now some important points about this
05:44 - is this expression now
05:46 - should be evaluated in constant value or
05:48 - integral value
05:50 - right
05:51 - like here i can simply write any integer
05:53 - value 1 2 3 4 5 like this
05:57 - any integer value or i can write down
05:59 - expression like 1 plus 2
06:01 - that is also fine
06:03 - or i can write here 2 into 2 that is
06:06 - also fine
06:07 - divide by 2 that is also an expression
06:10 - but that should be evaluated at last
06:12 - ultimately
06:13 - in
06:14 - constant constant value
06:17 - right
06:18 - i can also write a variable name like a
06:22 - the condition is we have to declare
06:24 - first of all a
06:25 - suppose a is equal to 5
06:27 - so a is also fine you can write down a
06:30 - plus 2 that is also fine
06:32 - you can write down a plus b but you have
06:34 - to declare b also b is equal to suppose
06:37 - 4
06:38 - a plus b is also fine a plus b plus c
06:39 - this kind of expression you can write
06:43 - fine
06:44 - second thing what you can write right
06:46 - here character also you can write
06:48 - suppose i am writing here
06:50 - rather than expression i am simply
06:52 - writing a
06:53 - see i haven't declared anything here and
06:56 - i am writing simply a
06:58 - that will give error but if you write
07:00 - here
07:01 - in single quote a it means in single
07:04 - code it will be considered as a
07:05 - character character would be you know
07:07 - stored in
07:09 - the format of sky number
07:10 - so the related associated numerical
07:13 - value for a is 97 so it would consider a
07:16 - as 97 integer value constant value so
07:18 - that is fine
07:19 - constant value is allowed here string is
07:21 - not allowed
07:22 - float is not allowed
07:24 - right i hope you got in expression what
07:26 - you can write down you can experiment
07:29 - when you write a program we will also
07:30 - experiment these things
07:32 - right
07:33 - and you can also experiment by yourself
07:37 - now this value these value value 1 value
07:39 - 2 value and these also be should have uh
07:44 - integral value
07:46 - like either a constant value one two
07:48 - three four zero minus one ninety nine
07:51 - these kind of things hundred
07:53 - two fifty seven
07:56 - desert value
07:57 - or character value same like i can write
08:00 - down
08:02 - e
08:03 - character value not simple a that would
08:06 - it's not a character
08:08 - it's a variable it will give error
08:09 - single quotes yeah that is character
08:11 - that is allowed a b c d capital a b c d
08:14 - or any symbols also like
08:16 - plus
08:18 - minus
08:19 - obviously these are also having
08:21 - associated sky value
08:23 - you can refer to the sky table so those
08:26 - symbols also you can use here
08:28 - but that should be associated with an
08:30 - integer value so integral type of thing
08:32 - we can write down here string
08:35 - not allowed float not allowed
08:37 - any comparison type of thing not allowed
08:39 - like
08:41 - a less than two not allowed these kind
08:43 - of things not allowed
08:45 - right
08:47 - now
08:50 - why we use this break
08:52 - break means just terminate this switch
08:56 - here
08:57 - and comes
08:58 - out of this switch suppose out of this
09:01 - switch i am writing here
09:04 - out of switch statement
09:10 - so
09:12 - break means
09:15 - once
09:16 - the condition is true like
09:18 - we will discuss this thing with the help
09:20 - of an example right first let me just
09:23 - draw a flow chart related
09:25 - you know
09:26 - associated with this thing then you will
09:28 - get it better
09:30 - okay so this is the flowchart i hope you
09:33 - can see this
09:34 - we have a switch expression first this
09:36 - would be evaluated based on that we'll
09:38 - check
09:39 - the values the case values right case
09:41 - one if it is true
09:43 - if it is true the value is matched with
09:45 - this value one the expression whatever
09:47 - value you have evaluated the constant
09:49 - value that would be matched
09:51 - if matched with this value 1 then
09:54 - yes true then this block of statement
09:56 - would be executed then break and after
09:58 - that break means
10:00 - out of the switch out of the switch
10:02 - means out of switch statement directly
10:04 - out of switch statement if case one
10:06 - value doesn't match it is false case two
10:09 - would be checked same thing would would
10:11 - happen if true
10:12 - the statement would be executed
10:14 - break and out of the switch if not true
10:18 - false third case would be checked fourth
10:20 - like this
10:21 - and number of case would be checked and
10:23 - after that directly default statement
10:25 - would be executed and out of switch
10:27 - statement
10:29 - this is simple working off switch case
10:30 - statement right
10:32 - now i have told you two important points
10:34 - what
10:35 - here you can have what these values you
10:38 - can have
10:39 - right
10:40 - now see if you don't write break
10:42 - statement here then it is not going to
10:45 - break here
10:46 - if this value would be matched it would
10:48 - enter here this statement would be
10:49 - executed and it would also execute this
10:52 - block of statement as soon as
10:54 - it find out a break
10:57 - then it will break it will come out of
10:59 - the
11:00 - switch
11:02 - out of the switch and go to out of
11:04 - switch statement right that is why we
11:07 - write down after
11:08 - every in every case break
11:10 - if you want that
11:12 - if this value is true if this value is
11:14 - matched
11:16 - these two cases should be executed so no
11:19 - need to write down this break
11:21 - right
11:22 - now
11:23 - if in the last you are writing default
11:26 - no need to write down this break but
11:28 - you can write down this default anywhere
11:30 - in the switch
11:32 - here also
11:34 - in between any case statement also if
11:36 - you are writing this default
11:38 - at the end it's okay if you are not
11:40 - writing at the end then it is compulsory
11:42 - you should write
11:44 - break in this default statement these
11:46 - points you need to take care right and
11:48 - this default is optional if you don't
11:50 - want to write it's okay
11:52 - then also this would be executed default
11:54 - means
11:55 - if any none of the case value is matched
11:58 - then by default maybe we are writing
12:00 - like enter valid choice
12:02 - right these kind of things so error or
12:05 - maybe error message you want to print so
12:07 - that is by default but it is completely
12:09 - optional
12:10 - right
12:11 - break is also optional but why we are
12:13 - writing break why it is compulsory that
12:14 - i have told you the reason also that
12:16 - i'll show you also
12:18 - when we write a program so let me just
12:20 - write down a program and show you the
12:22 - working of this switch case statement
12:25 - okay so first program we will write like
12:27 - see whenever you could do customer care
12:30 - then they give you multiple options like
12:32 - press one to do this thing press two to
12:34 - do this thing press nine to talk to our
12:37 - you know customer care executive right
12:39 - so according to your whatever number you
12:41 - will press according to that action
12:42 - would be performed right you have
12:43 - multiple choices so that kind of thing
12:45 - we are going to you know
12:47 - do with this uh switch case statement
12:49 - that program we are going to write
12:51 - so same header file using namespace std
12:54 - then main function i'm first of all
12:56 - writing uh taking int variable int
12:58 - choice
13:00 - ch choice enter your choice now i'm
13:02 - asking from the user enter your choice
13:04 - now see in we have entered a choice in
13:08 - switch simply write down ch i'm not
13:10 - writing
13:11 - at this point of time any expression
13:14 - long expression simple a variable i am
13:16 - writing so this variable value would be
13:18 - checked against that test case against
13:20 - the case values
13:22 - and
13:22 - match case if the case is matched
13:25 - associated to that
13:27 - whatever the statements are there that
13:30 - would be executed right
13:31 - so simply a variable i am writing ch
13:33 - whatever you will enter 1 2 9 5 4
13:38 - right
13:39 - switch ch now
13:41 - ok case first we will write like
13:52 - case one
13:53 - suppose
13:55 - i'm not writing any character i'm taking
13:58 - simple first integer value case one the
14:00 - value can be either integer or character
14:03 - right case 1 so in this case the output
14:05 - should be c out i wanna know my balance
14:08 - that's it then break
14:10 - then i'm writing case
14:12 - 2
14:13 - i want to register a complaint right
14:16 - okay now case
14:18 - nine i wanna talk to customer care
14:20 - executive generally
14:22 - at nine they give this option right
14:26 - so it's okay case one two nine
14:29 - any number you can write down it's not
14:30 - it's not like that you have to write on
14:31 - 1 2 3 4 no
14:34 - maybe here you can write down 13 at
14:36 - first
14:37 - then 2
14:38 - any number you can write down but the
14:40 - condition is it should be integer or
14:41 - character
14:42 - right 0 you can write down right
14:45 - okay now 1 2 and 9 i am writing
14:48 - after that i am writing default
14:52 - it is optional
14:53 - default and in default it should print
14:55 - like c out
14:59 - enter valid choice
15:03 - right
15:05 - and
15:08 - break
15:10 - okay fine
15:12 - now out of
15:13 - uh the switch i am writing c out end of
15:15 - switch case or may simply be i am
15:18 - writing
15:20 - out of switch case and return zero right
15:22 - let me just run this program it is
15:23 - simple program
15:25 - first of all it will ask enter your
15:27 - choice it is asking so i am entering
15:31 - 2
15:33 - now
15:33 - what it is printing i want to register a
15:35 - complaint i want to register a complaint
15:37 - because case 2 is the value is matching
15:40 - i'm entering 2 which
15:42 - case this is value 1 not matching then
15:44 - again case 2 yes it is matching so this
15:46 - statement would be executed i want to
15:48 - resist a complaint then break deck means
15:50 - out of switch out of switch i am writing
15:51 - out of switch case
15:53 - that's it
15:54 - again run this
15:56 - and
15:57 - okay
15:58 - let me just run this again
16:01 - enter your choice 9
16:06 - i'm want to talk to customer care
16:08 - executive out of switch case
16:11 - again run
16:12 - suppose this choice i'm writing 8 i'm
16:15 - entering 8
16:17 - then 8 is not matching with any case
16:19 - value 1 2 nine no so it will go to
16:22 - default default means enter valid choice
16:24 - so it is printing enter valid choice out
16:26 - of switch case
16:28 - fine i hope you got this
16:31 - okay
16:32 - you can simply write down ch any
16:34 - expression like ch plus 2 i am writing
16:37 - that is also fine because ultimately ch
16:40 - value you will enter plus 2 would give
16:43 - any constant value
16:45 - so suppose i am running this it will not
16:46 - give any error and i am entering the
16:49 - choice like 7
16:52 - so now it is printing i want to talk to
16:53 - customer care executive choice is 7
16:57 - in switch case we have switch expression
16:59 - we have cs plus 2 7 plus 2 is 9 so case
17:02 - 9 is
17:04 - the value match i want to talk to
17:05 - customer call executive
17:07 - okay
17:09 - any variable you are taking into a b c
17:14 - so you can write down here a plus b plus
17:16 - c or a into b now this kind of
17:18 - expression you can write or 2 plus 2 2
17:20 - into 2
17:21 - 5 plus 4 divided by
17:23 - 5 plus 4 divided by 2 this kind of thing
17:25 - but
17:27 - float value is not loud suppose i am
17:28 - writing here 1.2
17:30 - this is slot so it is giving error see
17:33 - expression must have
17:35 - integral or enum type integral means
17:38 - either integer or character character
17:40 - also will be represented with sky code
17:43 - integer value or enum type enumeration
17:45 - data type that is also allowed
17:47 - float string not allowed
17:49 - right
17:50 - now
17:51 - if
17:53 - now here
17:54 - rather than this one two three you can
17:55 - write down also characters also we can
17:57 - write down right so suppose uh
18:01 - i am this time i am taking
18:04 - data type of this character is care
18:07 - right
18:08 - ch care and case 1 i am writing suppose
18:11 - a
18:13 - small a
18:15 - okay
18:18 - and it will print
18:24 - the character is
18:25 - a
18:26 - that's it
18:28 - now case 2 i am taking
18:31 - capital a
18:34 - and here i am printing printing
18:38 - the character is
18:40 - capital a
18:43 - okay
18:47 - and case one i am taking suppose
18:51 - capital j
18:54 - so simply i'll print
19:03 - the character is day
19:08 - and in default i am printing enter valid
19:10 - character
19:12 - right and then out of switch
19:14 - so fine character values are also
19:16 - allowed integer or character let me just
19:18 - run this enter your choice i am printing
19:21 - small a
19:22 - the character is small a out of switch
19:24 - case
19:25 - again run this i'm print i'm entering r
19:30 - enter valid character after switch case
19:34 - no keys is matching right
19:36 - okay if uh see
19:40 - i don't write any break here
19:42 - in that case what will happen see
19:45 - let me just run this
19:47 - and show you
19:48 - enter your choice i'm
19:50 - entering kept small a
19:52 - so what it is printing the character is
19:54 - small a the character is capital a and
19:56 - then out of switch case why so
20:00 - i am entering a choice is a so it is
20:03 - matching with this case a so it will
20:05 - print the character is a
20:07 - then no break so it will continue
20:10 - executing the character is capital a now
20:14 - break yeah
20:16 - once it will find break out of switch
20:19 - right that is why we are writing break
20:23 - to
20:24 - break the flow the execution
20:27 - right
20:28 - now
20:29 - default you can write down anywhere in
20:31 - your program
20:32 - i am writing this default
20:34 - at starting
20:37 - if you are writing at starting or
20:38 - anywhere you are not writing at the end
20:40 - then it is compulsory to write down this
20:42 - break if you will not write down this
20:43 - break
20:46 - what will happen c let's run this i am
20:49 - entering
20:51 - small o small r
20:53 - what it will print
20:55 - small r is not in any case
20:58 - so it will
20:59 - be executing default statement default
21:01 - means enter valid character
21:04 - but it is printing the character is
21:06 - small a
21:07 - and then out of switch case why so
21:09 - because default is
21:12 - at the first at the beginning
21:14 - okay
21:14 - and after that there is no break
21:17 - so it will continue
21:20 - the execution
21:22 - the character is smaller now it is
21:24 - finding break now it will break
21:27 - out of the switch case that is why if
21:29 - you write down default
21:32 - in the middle of the program or you can
21:33 - say in the middle of the switch case or
21:35 - at the starting not at the end
21:37 - then it is compulsory to write down
21:39 - break at the end if you are writing
21:40 - default
21:41 - no need to write down break
21:43 - right
21:44 - okay now that's it ah okay second and
21:46 - maybe like i am writing here
21:49 - ch
21:54 - plus 2
21:57 - okay now let's run this
22:00 - enter your choice i'm entering
22:02 - capital h
22:04 - capital h means you will say like
22:06 - capital h is not matching with any case
22:09 - so default would be executed like enter
22:10 - valid character okay let's see
22:13 - no no no no it is printing enter the
22:15 - character is capital j
22:18 - and then out of switch case no default
22:20 - why so because in expression in switch
22:23 - expression we are writing ch plus 2
22:26 - means ch is
22:27 - h
22:29 - h plus 2 h i j
22:32 - if you add in the sky value so plus 2 if
22:35 - you loo then it will be j
22:38 - right so yes we have a case j this is
22:41 - the case and the character is j it will
22:42 - print right
22:44 - so i hope you got now you can experiment
22:46 - with yourself right different different
22:49 - cases can be there different different
22:51 - kind of things you can do with this
22:52 - thing
22:53 - just try to use here string hair string
22:56 - what error you are getting
22:58 - you have to be familiar with the error
23:00 - also like if you write down this thing
23:02 - string this type of error you will get
23:05 - right
23:06 - that is also very uh it's a good
23:08 - practice to be a good coder you have to
23:11 - you know identify the errors type of
23:13 - errors what you can get
23:15 - right and how to resolve that kind of
23:16 - errors how to identify
23:18 - so now one assignment for you is you
23:20 - have to write down a program
23:22 - it's you can say a project simple
23:23 - project for you guys you have to devise
23:25 - a calculator right
23:27 - if i press plus
23:29 - it will ask you from the user like first
23:31 - of all enter two numbers a or b you can
23:33 - say then if it lasts enter the operator
23:36 - or enter your choice if i enter plus
23:39 - plus operator it will add these two
23:41 - numbers if i enter minus it will
23:43 - subtract if i enter into it will
23:45 - multiply if i enter divide it will
23:48 - divide if i enter modulo it will give
23:51 - you a reminder or the modulo operation
23:53 - would be formed so this is for your
23:54 - assignment you have to write down a
23:55 - program something like this
23:58 - you have to devise a calculator
24:00 - right
24:00 - so rather than now
24:02 - here the case value would be rather than
24:04 - a b c or one two three four
24:06 - you can use any symbol also plus minus
24:09 - into multiply divide
24:11 - okay
24:12 - so this you have to do this is your
24:13 - assignment
24:14 - and second assignment is so this is your
24:17 - assignment right
24:19 - you have to enter the choice
24:20 - and these are the cases capital p small
24:23 - sorry capital a
24:25 - small a then default then capital j
24:28 - right and what you need to enter first
24:31 - input should be capital a what output
24:33 - you will get then capital p
24:36 - then small b
24:37 - then capital j and then small a
24:41 - now you have to tell me what output you
24:43 - will be getting according to these these
24:44 - are the cases right
24:46 - so now i hope you are now familiar with
24:49 - switch case and you can do experiment
24:51 - with yourself you are you know familiar
24:53 - with the basics of switch case statement
24:54 - how to use it why to use it and what is
24:56 - which case right
24:58 - so now the next video till then bye take
25:00 - care
