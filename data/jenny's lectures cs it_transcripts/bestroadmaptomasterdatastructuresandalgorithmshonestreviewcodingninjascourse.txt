00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so I hope from the title you
00:04 - have got the idea this video is going to
00:05 - be about data structure and algorithm
00:08 - which is a very important subject for a
00:10 - computer science student and see many
00:12 - students ask these type of questions
00:13 - from me and I hope I'm sure you will
00:15 - also have you also have these kind of
00:17 - questions in your mind like as data
00:20 - structure a must for any interview or it
00:23 - just a Hy and if yes then how many how
00:26 - much data structure uh you know which
00:28 - topics how many topics you should learn
00:31 - to sit in an interview to crack a to
00:33 - crack an interview right and from where
00:37 - to learn from where to start DSA
00:39 - learning DSA the platform or the courses
00:43 - which courses are good how many problems
00:45 - you should sold to get a good command on
00:47 - data structure and algorithm right
00:50 - especially for a beginner it's uh you
00:52 - know very
00:53 - confusing type of thing like yeah we
00:56 - know DSA is important for any job
00:58 - interview but from where to start
01:00 - learning DSA and what should be a proper
01:02 - road map an ideal road map from where
01:06 - you can solve the problem which kind of
01:08 - problems basic Advanced
01:10 - intermediate definitely it's very
01:13 - important to solve quality problems
01:15 - right so which platform is better these
01:19 - type of questions so I will try my best
01:23 - to answer these questions in this video
01:26 - okay now first of all let me just let uh
01:29 - just let me just give you a brief
01:31 - overview of data structure and algorithm
01:32 - what is DSA data structure and algorithm
01:34 - now what is data structure data
01:36 - structure is basically you know just a
01:38 - way of storing and organizing or you can
01:42 - say managing the data okay store a data
01:46 - in store data in such a way that you can
01:49 - access you can manage you can process
01:51 - you can retrieve that data easily and
01:55 - efficiently okay so it's just a way to
01:57 - store that data to organize that data to
01:59 - man manage that data okay and there are
02:01 - many basic and advanced data structures
02:03 - I hope you have heard these like arrays
02:05 - link list stack cues trees graphs
02:08 - hashmap tries many data structures okay
02:12 - and see all these data structures are
02:14 - designed to store data you know in such
02:17 - a way to fulfill a specific purpose to
02:20 - suit a specific
02:22 - purpose right so now what are algorithms
02:26 - algorithms are just processors to solve
02:29 - a problem or you can say a step by step
02:31 - explanation step by step processes to
02:34 - solve a problem to perform a computation
02:36 - to perform a
02:37 - task right like if you want to cook
02:40 - something so you go to YouTube and you
02:42 - just see the recipe maybe you just take
02:44 - down the steps all the recipe on a paper
02:48 - so that paper those steps are just
02:50 - algorithm to prepare that food to cook
02:52 - that item okay so it's an algorithm so
02:56 - same to solve a problem in computer also
02:59 - we have have
03:00 - algorithms okay you just write down in
03:03 - simple English language in the steps
03:06 - like to add two numbers so first take
03:09 - input from the user then add two numbers
03:12 - then output then print the sum like this
03:15 - so these three or four steps are just
03:17 - algorithms so these are algorithms so
03:18 - many algorithms are there like uh if you
03:21 - want to sort some numbers then there are
03:23 - many sorting algorithms like uh bubble s
03:27 - insertion quick merge many sorts many
03:30 - sorting algorithm searching algorithm
03:31 - linear binary search graph traversal DFS
03:35 - BFS shortest distance finding algorithm
03:38 - Destra bman for Floyd warell many
03:41 - algorithms are there right so these are
03:46 - algorithms so data structure and
03:48 - algorithm this combined these topics so
03:52 - here in data data structure algorithm
03:55 - you will learn different different data
03:57 - structures arrays link list stacks cues
04:00 - trees graphs hashmap these are Advanced
04:03 - data structure tries so and their
04:06 - implementation their applications how to
04:08 - use the data those data structures as
04:10 - well as
04:11 - algorithms sorting searching short
04:14 - distance finding algorithm graph ders
04:16 - algorithm as well as dynamic programming
04:18 - which is also very important topic in
04:20 - DSC from interview point of view okay so
04:23 - these topics comprise DSC data structure
04:26 - and algorithm right now uh if you are a
04:30 - beginner then let me just tell you
04:31 - before just directly jumping to data
04:33 - structure algorithm what should be the
04:35 - proper approach okay or what should be
04:38 - the proper road map or what are you can
04:41 - say prerequisite to go for DSC so first
04:44 - thing you just pick a language any
04:46 - object oriented language like AB C++
04:49 - Java python any language you can pick
04:51 - and start learning that language the
04:54 - basic building blocks of that language
04:56 - first like basic syntax in that language
05:00 - then variables then you can say what
05:04 - keywords and operators in that language
05:07 - then conditionals like ifls loops and
05:11 - functions so these are basic building
05:13 - blocks of any language so first have a
05:15 - good command on these things and then
05:17 - start writing code okay next thing what
05:21 - you need to do learn go for
05:25 - complexities now why complexities if you
05:28 - don't have any idea about comp
05:29 - complexities can you write down a
05:31 - program yes of course you can write down
05:33 - any program then why complexities are
05:36 - important see you are going now for DSA
05:39 - data structure and algorithm okay now
05:42 - DSA the main goal of DSA is to solve a
05:45 - problem efficiently and
05:48 - effectively okay to write down a
05:50 - program for solving any problem
05:53 - efficiently effectively that program
05:55 - should be efficient okay now if there's
05:59 - a problem and me and my friend has
06:02 - written the program the to solve that
06:04 - problem so there can be many ways to
06:06 - solve a particular problem it's not like
06:08 - that there is only one way to write down
06:11 - a program to solve a problem there can
06:12 - be many ways now how we are going to
06:14 - compare which program is
06:17 - better mine or my friend's program okay
06:21 - which approach is better okay based on
06:24 - what you are going to compare those
06:25 - programs see generally in class we
06:29 - compare students based on marks like if
06:32 - one is having higher you know marks then
06:35 - he's good or she is good like this we
06:37 - going to compare based on marks okay now
06:39 - how we are going to measure how we going
06:41 - to compare those programs based on
06:43 - complexities here complexities comes
06:44 - into picture Okay so complexities are
06:48 - measured to you know compare those
06:51 - programs those approaches to solve that
06:53 - problem now there are two complexities
06:56 - type of complexities time and space so
06:58 - time complexities are going to measure
06:59 - the time taken to execute that code and
07:02 - space complexity is going to measure the
07:05 - amount of space or you can say amount of
07:06 - memory required to execute all the
07:10 - functionalities of that code okay now
07:12 - the one approach with less time taken
07:17 - and you know less space required is
07:21 - obviously better than the other one if
07:23 - my program is taking only like maybe 0.5
07:28 - second to execute and my friend's
07:29 - program is going to take 1 second or you
07:31 - can say 3 second to execute then
07:33 - obviously my program is better okay
07:35 - because I'm taking my Approach is taking
07:37 - less time okay so based on complexities
07:40 - we are going to compare those approaches
07:42 - and programs or algorithms right so
07:45 - before going to DSA complexities are
07:47 - also important you have to go through
07:50 - complexities okay those notations biger
07:52 - notations Theta notations like this then
07:56 - you can go for DSA topics so these are
07:59 - Broad three steps learn any language
08:01 - then complexities then go for DSC topics
08:04 - now how much time you need to complete
08:06 - this DS course see it depends if you
08:10 - don't have if you're a beginner if you
08:11 - don't have any structured course okay
08:13 - you are just learning from here and
08:15 - there so maybe sometimes some for some
08:17 - students some students can take only you
08:19 - know almost 1 year 1 and a half year 8
08:22 - months 9 months to complete TSA course
08:24 - it depends on your capabilities and the
08:26 - resources you have okay but if you have
08:30 - proper structured course proper
08:32 - resources you have then hardly it will
08:34 - take four to 5 months to complete DSC
08:36 - course okay you'll be good during the
08:38 - after 5 months in DSA you'll have uh you
08:42 - know good problem solving skills you'll
08:44 - have good knowledge of data structures
08:45 - you'll have good knowledge of algorithms
08:48 - okay now obviously it depends like how
08:51 - much time you devote during that five
08:54 - month five months or how much you
08:56 - dedicated you are to learn theay okay
09:00 - now how many problems next question is
09:01 - how many problems you should solve to
09:03 - get a good command on DSA you know it
09:06 - also depends on student to student and
09:09 - on the quality of problems you
09:11 - solve okay now if you're dedicated and
09:15 - you solve some quality problems maybe
09:17 - 100 quality problems you have solved 200
09:19 - quality problems you have soled and the
09:21 - one which is randomly solving any
09:23 - problem like maybe 300 problems he has
09:26 - solved then me and you have solved 200
09:29 - quality problems then you are better
09:31 - your problem solving skills would be
09:33 - better okay so it depends which type of
09:37 - problems you solve so now if you search
09:39 - for DSA courses then on YouTube also you
09:42 - will get many free courses on DSA many
09:45 - free courses are available many paid
09:46 - courses are available okay
09:49 - nowadays many if you want to learn
09:51 - anything you will get on internet right
09:55 - and yeah there are many good DS
09:57 - resources even I also Al have one DSC
10:00 - course which is very good but the
10:01 - problem in these free courses is what
10:03 - you are learning from YouTube you are
10:05 - getting everything the video is good
10:07 - okay but the problem is if you get any
10:10 - doubt then who is going to solve that
10:13 - doubt you cannot directly ask to that
10:15 - instructor okay maybe you can comment
10:18 - below that video and chances are maybe
10:22 - you will get answer of your question but
10:23 - every time definitely for a YouTuber for
10:26 - a content creator it's not you can say
10:29 - easy for answer all the questions okay
10:31 - in a free course so you will not
10:33 - definitely you will not get answer of
10:34 - all your questions all your doubts you
10:37 - can ask your colleagues you can search
10:39 - on Google and there are many resources
10:42 - but what
10:43 - if there is someone to help you at that
10:46 - time only to solve your doubt someone
10:49 - you can trust a teacher a teaching
10:51 - assistant you can say okay so I think
10:53 - that would be great that option and that
10:57 - is not available
11:00 - on definitely on free courses this doubt
11:02 - resolution support is not available and
11:04 - even in many paid courses also this
11:06 - thing is not available doubt resolution
11:08 - support okay so here I'm going to review
11:13 - for you a course provided by coding in
11:16 - jazz there you will get all these
11:18 - features Under One
11:20 - Roof okay let me just show you first the
11:24 - curriculum of this course so this is
11:27 - detailed curriculum of this DSC course
11:29 - by coding in jazz you'll get here see
11:32 - first introduction to programming that
11:34 - language you can learn you can go to any
11:38 - course like C++ you can choose C++
11:42 - python course or Java course okay now
11:46 - first they going to teach you that
11:47 - basics of programming so they have
11:49 - divided this into subtopics and then
11:51 - details as well as what they are going
11:53 - to teach okay in that under that topic
11:56 - under that subtopic then comes to loops
11:58 - and functions arrays and then character
12:00 - arrays 2D arrays and strings then comes
12:03 - to data structure problem solving
12:06 - techniques that here we have subtopics
12:08 - like pointers and dynamical location
12:10 - complexities time and space complexity
12:13 - STL recursion
12:14 - backtracking okay then comes to oops
12:18 - concept Basics oop basic oop concept and
12:20 - then Advanced concept of oops like
12:23 - function overloading obstruction
12:25 - capsulation inheritance polymorphism
12:26 - these things virtual functions then
12:28 - linear data structure link list stats
12:31 - and cues then
12:33 - trees then Advanced data structure like
12:35 - priority cues hash map price graphs and
12:38 - then important topic is dynamic
12:40 - programming introduction to dynamic
12:42 - programming and then applications of
12:44 - dynamic programming some problems also
12:47 - so this is what our you can say car
12:50 - complete curriculum of this DSC
12:54 - course so now let me just go to their
12:56 - website coding nj.com the link I'll put
12:58 - in the description box of this video
13:00 - okay and I'm going to log in with my
13:01 - mail
13:03 - ID after entering OTP I just logged in
13:07 - and just click on this my classroom and
13:12 - I'll be redirected to this page I have
13:14 - already enrolled here in these courses
13:18 - okay here see this is this type of page
13:22 - would be opened and I have already
13:23 - enrolled in these courses okay so this
13:26 - the these courses are shown in my
13:27 - profile
13:29 - now here you can see you can interact
13:31 - with your batchmate
13:33 - also you can start conversation with
13:35 - your batchmates here you can set weekly
13:39 - goal like I have set three days a week
13:41 - you can addit your goals 2 days a week 3
13:44 - days a week or any goal you can set
13:46 - weekly goal you can set let me just show
13:49 - you the course this basics of C++ with
13:51 - the data structure and algorithm okay
13:54 - the start date of this course is 2nd of
13:56 - October right now let me just show you
13:59 - the course content they have divided
14:02 - this course see
14:05 - weekly and this is the
14:08 - leaderboard okay now you can solve a
14:11 - problem and then you are going to enter
14:13 - into this leader board then you will get
14:14 - your ranking here you can bookmark your
14:17 - important notes okay now see
14:19 - introduction to C++ and then data
14:20 - structure in C++ so weekly they have
14:23 - divided the scores so in week one
14:26 - lecture one is flowchart then lecture
14:29 - to let me just show you once you will
14:32 - click on this lecture this type of page
14:35 - will be open and see now you can play
14:38 - this and you can learn so here you have
14:42 - lecture then problem also see this is
14:47 - the problem and you can solve this
14:48 - problem you don't have to submit this
14:49 - thing then decision making lecture then
14:52 - also they you have problems lectures
14:55 - problems and then you have notes as well
14:58 - so everything you are getting Under One
15:00 - Roof notes lectures like video recorded
15:03 - video as well as problems assignment
15:05 - also you are having
15:08 - okay so you will have mcqs as well the
15:12 - lectures as well as mcqs you can submit
15:15 - your
15:15 - options and I have gone through these
15:18 - lectures few lectures the instructor is
15:21 - very good so based on if I need to give
15:24 - the rating based on faculty teaching
15:27 - style I like it
15:29 - and I'll give it 9 out of 10 the
15:32 - explainer the way the faculty is
15:35 - explaining the concept from basic every
15:38 - point it's very good so it's nine out of
15:41 - 10 from my side and the course structure
15:43 - see weekly they have divided the scores
15:46 - right then patterns after that operators
15:49 - and Loops then arrays everything as well
15:52 - as the quality of questions they have
15:55 - given is also good then searching and
15:58 - sorting
15:59 - character
16:02 - arrays and after that string so the
16:05 - course structure based on C structure
16:07 - I'll give definitely eight out of 10 and
16:10 - after that data structure and algorithm
16:11 - which is logged and it will be unlocking
16:13 - on 27th of November this is also you
16:17 - know weekly they have divided this thing
16:19 - right you can see pointers Dynamic
16:21 - location STL then complexities then oops
16:24 - concept then link list straps skes trees
16:28 - after that BST priority cues recursion
16:31 - dynamic programming PR hmen everything
16:35 - and the thing which I like the most is
16:37 - that doubt resolution support So if you
16:39 - are watching any lecture you have any
16:40 - doubt so you can click on that ask or
16:42 - view doubts okay and you can just select
16:46 - you help me with code questions or
16:48 - concept which kind of doubt you have
16:51 - okay you can just select that thing and
16:54 - accordingly you can select everything
16:56 - like understanding what regarding which
16:59 - you need to ask your out okay maybe need
17:02 - more clarity you can describe your issue
17:05 - and you will get answer let me just show
17:07 - you so I have asked this questions and I
17:10 - have got reply I have got response from
17:13 - that ta within seconds and then I have
17:15 - waited I guess for 1 minute and then I
17:18 - got reply so this doubt resolution
17:21 - support is very would B based on that
17:24 - I'll rate this thing 10 on 10 okay
17:27 - because this this is one thing I like
17:29 - the most in this one so if I need to
17:32 - give the overall rating to this course
17:35 - like you know faculty teaching style
17:37 - course structure course content out
17:39 - resolution support the type of problem
17:41 - quality of problem then definitely I'll
17:43 - give 9 out of 10 okay now you will have
17:48 - extra 10 15% discount extra 15% discount
17:52 - on this course if you register using the
17:55 - coupon link that I'll put in the
17:57 - description box of this video okay so
17:59 - all the relevant links and details the
18:01 - links you will get in the description
18:03 - box of this video you can go and check
18:04 - out and if you like this video and if
18:07 - you want me to make this type of review
18:10 - video more and more then you can let me
18:12 - know in comment section so now I'll see
18:13 - you in the next video then bye-bye take
18:15 - care
