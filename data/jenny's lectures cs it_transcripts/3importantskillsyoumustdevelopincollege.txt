00:00 - hello everyone i hope you all are safe
00:02 - and doing good so if you are a college
00:04 - student or if you are planning to be a
00:05 - part of that college life soon then this
00:07 - video is definitely for you
00:09 - see there are something in college you
00:11 - can learn outside the classroom
00:14 - it's not like that everything you will
00:15 - learn inside the classroom and that
00:17 - something is really really really
00:19 - important throughout your life that is
00:21 - really be very helpful throughout your
00:24 - life
00:25 - so that's exactly i'm going to discuss
00:27 - in this video those three skills
00:29 - that nobody is going to teach you inside
00:32 - that classroom you are supposed to
00:34 - develop these skills
00:36 - during your college life during your
00:37 - college days yourself you have to
00:40 - develop these skills and these three
00:42 - skills are very important for your life
00:44 - also these lessons you can show these
00:47 - skills everyone
00:49 - must develop these skills during your
00:50 - college during their college life
00:53 - so without further delay let's get
00:55 - started
00:56 - the first is very important that is
00:58 - self learning
01:02 - this attitude you are supposed to
01:03 - develop this attitude during your
01:05 - college life see maybe you are lucky
01:07 - enough you got
01:09 - great teachers they are like you know
01:12 - they provide you notes they teach you
01:13 - very well they tell you from which book
01:15 - you are supposed to study this concept
01:17 - this topic and everything they teach you
01:20 - everything they tell you right and you
01:23 - just follow their instructions but
01:26 - once you will go into the real life once
01:29 - you will enter into the industry once
01:30 - you will get the job at that time
01:33 - nobody is going to teach you something
01:35 - like this nobody is going to be there
01:37 - for you yeah yeah let's sit and i'll
01:39 - teach you
01:41 - from this book you have to study from
01:42 - this resource you have to study from
01:44 - here you have to study this thing no
01:47 - so maybe at college time you think that
01:50 - yeah faculty is teaching you are like
01:52 - you know they are spoon feed feed you
01:55 - and you think that yeah i'm very lucky
01:57 - faculty hote but
01:59 - you will realize this thing after
02:02 - going after entering into the real life
02:04 - after entering into the industry
02:06 - that's not good for you
02:09 - right so someone is there some faculty
02:11 - is there not providing you notes maybe
02:14 - not teaching you very well so
02:16 - take this as a plus point make self
02:19 - learning as a habit at that time it's a
02:21 - great time for you
02:23 - because during college days i know you
02:25 - waste
02:26 - everybody waste at least five to six
02:29 - hours a day at least you don't know
02:32 - anything during those hours
02:35 - so you are supposed to utilize that time
02:37 - because i guess you are aware about this
02:38 - thing technology is changing rapidly
02:42 - and if you want to be in the market if
02:44 - you want to be a part of that industry
02:45 - for long if you want you know you know
02:48 - get if you want to get promoted
02:50 - then obviously you are supposed to adapt
02:53 - those technologies you are supposed to
02:55 - adapt those changes you are supposed to
02:59 - learn new skills
03:00 - you are supposed to expand your skill
03:02 - set or maybe if you want to switch to
03:05 - any good company then obviously you are
03:06 - supposed to you know they they they'll
03:09 - see that what you have learned during
03:12 - your
03:13 - previous job and that learning would be
03:15 - self learning obviously so i would
03:17 - suggest please build this self-learning
03:20 - attitude
03:21 - during your college life don't just
03:22 - totally dependent on your college
03:24 - faculties on your you know friends like
03:27 - rahul is good in this subject and he is
03:30 - going to teach me one day before exam
03:31 - that's it
03:34 - okay rahul will teach you at that time
03:36 - but will rahul be with you
03:38 - throughout your life
03:40 - no and if you are that kind of student
03:42 - like who is totally dependent on other
03:44 - your maybe your friends or your college
03:45 - faculty is like you you you are not
03:48 - interested in learning yourself you need
03:50 - spoon feeding
03:51 - and if if you are this kind of student
03:53 - then definitely definitely you will be
03:55 - in great trouble once you will enter
03:57 - into the real world once you will enter
03:59 - into that industry
04:00 - maybe if you will get a job or maybe you
04:03 - want to start your own startup or
04:05 - business in both the situation whether
04:07 - you are getting a job or you want to be
04:09 - a entrepreneur
04:10 - you need this attitude self-learning
04:13 - attitude right
04:14 - second thing which is very important is
04:17 - to work on your communication see if
04:19 - there is something which is as important
04:21 - as education is
04:23 - i think that thing is
04:24 - communication skills
04:28 - you are sitting in a placement or during
04:29 - your life also after college also in
04:32 - your real life also communication is
04:34 - very very very important
04:35 - skill to have see i guess you all are
04:38 - agree if you are good you are having
04:40 - good communication skill definitely
04:42 - you will have a edge in the interview
04:44 - over the other candidates who are not
04:46 - good communicator right
04:48 - and suppose one student is having higher
04:51 - gpa than your higher marks than you
04:54 - and you are very good communicator you
04:56 - are having strong communication skill
04:57 - and that student is not having the
04:59 - communication skill definitely i'll i
05:01 - think they'll prefer you because you are
05:03 - able to express your thoughts you are
05:05 - able to communicate with those guys
05:08 - right you are able to you know you know
05:10 - transfer the information whatever you
05:12 - know you are able to communicate you are
05:14 - able to express that information to to
05:16 - those guys
05:17 - and that's exactly they want it's not
05:19 - like that there you will sit alone and
05:20 - work you're not supposed to communicate
05:22 - with any other you know
05:24 - any other people in that uh you know
05:26 - company and i guess apart from the job
05:28 - also apart from interview also in your
05:30 - real life also communication is very
05:31 - very very important at every point of
05:33 - time you you are supposed to communicate
05:35 - with other people in society also or
05:38 - anywhere
05:39 - so if you are a good communicator
05:41 - that will be enough you know it's a very
05:44 - good impression on others
05:46 - and how you can increase your
05:47 - communication skill there are many
05:49 - events during your school days that
05:50 - happens so you can participate in those
05:52 - events
05:53 - right try to explore things don't be an
05:56 - introvert kind of student during your
05:57 - college days group collaborations are
06:00 - there
06:00 - try to be a volunteer in any event or
06:03 - you can you can head any new project
06:06 - don't just restrict yourself to the
06:08 - courses or the subject the faculty is
06:10 - going to teach no there are many many
06:13 - many important other things in the
06:15 - college you should or you i guess you
06:17 - must explore
06:19 - the other activities the daily
06:20 - activities
06:23 - you must participate in those activities
06:25 - like any competition debate competition
06:27 - or any other competition
06:29 - those kind of thing maybe at starting
06:31 - you will hesitate like you are not
06:33 - good in expressing yourself you are not
06:36 - good in english and it's not like that
06:38 - you must know english you should be
06:40 - fluent in english to be a good
06:42 - communicator communication skills are
06:44 - different and english speaking is
06:46 - different you can also communicate in
06:47 - hindi but some students you know are not
06:50 - able to
06:52 - put their thoughts so there you know
06:54 - whatever they know their information in
06:56 - hindi even in hindi
06:58 - right
07:01 - whether you are speaking hindi or
07:02 - english or any language confidently you
07:04 - should speak that language so please
07:06 - work on your communication skill
07:09 - and third thing is it is also very
07:11 - important that is you are supposed to
07:13 - learn time management because see i
07:15 - think in college during college days
07:17 - most of the students live in hostel
07:19 - maybe in pg and your parents are not not
07:21 - there
07:22 - to instruct you every time like wake you
07:24 - up at right time and everything
07:26 - so you are supposed to manage yourself
07:29 - you are supposed to be independent at
07:30 - that time you are supposed to manage
07:32 - your time at that time
07:33 - right
07:34 - like wake up at right time have
07:36 - breakfast and go to your classroom and
07:38 - if you have some time then like this
07:40 - time i have to do this thing and suppose
07:42 - in evening i am supposed to go to meet
07:45 - someone or maybe your girlfriend or
07:47 - boyfriend there but before that thing
07:49 - you are supposed to you are supposed to
07:50 - complete these two or three tasks today
07:52 - only right i have this much of time and
07:55 - i am supposed to complete these tasks
07:56 - within this time only don't think i'll
07:58 - do this tomorrow then tomorrow and then
08:00 - tomorrow many students do this kind of
08:02 - thing during their college days because
08:04 - see
08:05 - if
08:06 - whenever
08:07 - whenever you will get a job and once you
08:10 - go to that industry then maybe they'll
08:13 - give you some deadline like you're
08:14 - supposed to complete this project and
08:15 - this task
08:16 - within this deadline and if you have a
08:19 - habit of managing your time properly
08:20 - then it would not be tough for you and
08:22 - see why i'm saying develop these habits
08:24 - during your college
08:37 - after finishing your college maybe you
08:39 - will get a job or in you will start your
08:41 - own business or startup
08:44 - then
08:45 - developing these habits would really be
08:47 - tough for you
08:48 - right
08:49 - i think you are agree with me but now
08:52 - you have time in the college during your
08:54 - college life you have time you can
08:56 - develop these habits slowly you have two
08:57 - to three years or four years you have
08:59 - enough time
09:00 - to develop these habits
09:02 - because i know many students think if
09:04 - you are late in lecture like 10 minutes
09:06 - or 15 minutes
09:10 - but those you know little little things
09:12 - really matters
09:14 - after in your real life you can see once
09:17 - you got a job and you will go there then
09:19 - maybe time is like 8 o'clock in the
09:21 - morning you are supposed to punch there
09:23 - otherwise you'll be marked as absent
09:25 - so there would be there are no option to
09:27 - be one or two minutes later five minutes
09:29 - late or 15 minutes late
09:31 - right at that time you will realize this
09:33 - thing
09:34 - and note only these three skills there
09:36 - are many skills you can develop during
09:39 - your college days apart from outside the
09:41 - classroom apart from the courses or the
09:43 - subjects you are studying right those
09:45 - technical skills apart from that thing
09:47 - the life lessons i would say or the
09:49 - skills life skills that would be you
09:51 - know really helpful during your life
09:53 - not only these there are many skills
09:55 - but i guess these skills are basics and
09:58 - these skills are for everyone
10:01 - whether you are doing any degree b tech
10:02 - or maybe bca or ba or diploma or
10:06 - anything
10:07 - cs branch mechanical civil any branch
10:10 - for every student i guess these skills
10:12 - are very important
10:14 - the basics or general skills these are
10:17 - if you think
10:19 - that yeah we should develop this skill
10:21 - also this is also really very important
10:23 - then you can write down that skill in
10:24 - the comment box so that others can also
10:26 - read that thing
10:27 - so i guess that's it for this video now
10:29 - i'll see you in the next video till then
10:30 - bye take care
