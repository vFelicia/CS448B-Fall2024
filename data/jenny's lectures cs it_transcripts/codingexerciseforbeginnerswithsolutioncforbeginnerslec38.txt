00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:01 - doing good so the series of learning C++
00:03 - programming language we are discussing
00:06 - we have discussed actually break and
00:07 - continue statement in the previous video
00:09 - we have seen continue statement now
00:11 - based on those statement we will be
00:12 - discussing one coding exercise right in
00:14 - in this you have to use both break and
00:16 - continue statement together right so the
00:20 - problem statement is suppose we have
00:22 - some data in an
00:25 - array array is simply like it's
00:28 - collection of homogeneous dat type right
00:30 - so we have an integer array and this is
00:32 - the data of this array right it is being
00:35 - sent by some device let's assume right
00:38 - and that device also sends sometimes
00:40 - noise the noise is represented by minus
00:43 - one right and one stopping signal
00:46 - stopping signal is represented by - 99
00:50 - right now what you have to do you have
00:51 - to process that data process means you
00:53 - have to print this data right but you
00:57 - don't have to process noise
01:00 - means you don't you don't have to print
01:02 - noise means minus one right and you have
01:06 - to stop processing the data once you
01:08 - reach once you get the stopping signal
01:10 - and that is -
01:14 - 99 I hope you got what is the problem
01:16 - statement right you have to just print
01:19 - this array but you don't have to print
01:21 - minus one minus one and you have to stop
01:22 - whenever you will get min - 99 so
01:25 - ultimately the answer would be 1 10 5 6
01:28 - 7 that's it
01:30 - you have to print this thing and one
01:32 - more condition use range based for Loop
01:36 - although you can implement this with any
01:38 - Loop for while do while but you can try
01:41 - implementing this with different
01:42 - different Loops but we are going to
01:44 - discuss in this exercise using range
01:46 - based for right I hope you got this
01:49 - thing so pause the video and try this
01:50 - out okay so I hope you have done this we
01:54 - have this array
01:56 - of data right so we have to process
01:59 - process this thing using range based for
02:02 - Loop so range based for Loop syntaxes
02:04 - just use
02:05 - four and the data type which is of this
02:09 - data so better to use Auto because it
02:12 - will automatically detect the data type
02:14 - of the this range and automatically you
02:17 - know consider the data type of let's
02:18 - take any variable any variable x y z ABC
02:21 - anything I'm taking
02:22 - n right and then colon so the data type
02:25 - of this variable would be automatically
02:27 - int right because what whatever here
02:31 - that range or that collection you will
02:34 - write name of that thing so name of the
02:35 - array is data so WR data here so
02:39 - whatever the data type of this data this
02:41 - array automatically that data type would
02:43 - be of this n so it is in 10 see whenever
02:45 - you will drag the cursor move the cursor
02:49 - Over N it is showing you int n but I'm
02:51 - writing Auto n right so now you have to
02:56 - implement the logic first let's
03:00 - uh just write down the stopping
03:02 - condition if this n equal to equal to -
03:07 - 99 then break means you don't have to
03:11 - process after that so we'll use
03:12 - obviously to jump out of the loop use
03:14 - break now next
03:17 - is else
03:20 - if this Nal equal minus1 then you don't
03:26 - have to stop you just have to skip that
03:28 - equation means we don't want to print
03:29 - this minus one but after that we want to
03:31 - print 5 six right so we will use
03:33 - continue we are going to skip something
03:37 - some condition right and after that what
03:39 - you want to skip this printing
03:43 - processing processing means simply you
03:45 - want to print this
03:49 - n
03:50 - right so I think this is simple one we
03:53 - have used break continue and range based
03:56 - for Loop let's run this I hope it will
03:58 - work see one 11 10 5 6 7 and that's
04:01 - exactly you want it should be printed
04:04 - like
04:05 - this 11 10 5 6 7 no minus one and once
04:10 - we it reach to - 99 just stop printing
04:13 - or stop processing the data right now I
04:17 - hope you have now a clear idea of using
04:19 - break continue and this kind of thing
04:22 - right so that's it for this video so I
04:25 - hope this exercise was not tough for you
04:27 - guys and you have done this now in the
04:29 - next video we'll see what is infinite
04:31 - Loop so now I'll see you in the next
04:33 - video then bye take
04:39 - care
