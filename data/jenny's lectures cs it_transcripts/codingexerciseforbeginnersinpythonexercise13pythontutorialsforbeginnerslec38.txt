00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:02 - video we have seen what does nested list
00:04 - and how to use necessarily with the help
00:07 - of a program right so till now we have
00:10 - seen about list what is list how to
00:12 - access element of list what is indexing
00:14 - and list what is index error what is
00:16 - nested list
00:18 - right this thing we have seen based on
00:20 - that we will do one coding exercise
00:22 - right this one is little bit tricky so
00:24 - you have to you know concentrate here
00:27 - first of all understand the problem
00:29 - problem statement then start writing the
00:32 - logic right what I want is see
00:36 - I have a metric something like this
00:41 - three into three metrics suppose only
00:44 - like one one one I have in this list
00:46 - sorry in Matrix right
00:49 - and
00:50 - one position I want to select at which
00:53 - suppose I want to hide my money under
00:57 - this one I want to hide my money
01:00 - right so see this these are rows these
01:04 - are columns so one two three three row
01:06 - and one two three column we have in this
01:08 - Matrix three into three Matrix
01:10 - so if I write like if I
01:15 - I want to hide my money at this position
01:18 - 3 2.
01:19 - so first this stands for the Row third
01:23 - row second means second column third row
01:26 - second column here
01:28 - here I want to hide I want to mark this
01:31 - position I want to hide my money under
01:33 - this one
01:35 - so suppose I want to put a x
01:38 - on the selected position I want to put X
01:41 - if I give you the position I give you 2
01:44 - 3.
01:45 - means first second row third column
01:49 - second row third column here I will put
01:52 - X this time
01:54 - right
01:56 - so the position user will enter if I
01:59 - enter the position if I ask from the
02:01 - user and user enter the position one one
02:04 - means first row First Column here I'll
02:07 - mark x this time
02:10 - so this you need to do
02:13 - so here you have to use list concept
02:15 - nested list concept indexing concept
02:18 - right
02:20 - now let me just give you one hint
02:23 - you can consider this is one list this
02:26 - is second list this is third list
02:29 - right and you can print these three
02:32 - lists in the form of
02:34 - Matrix that's very simple
02:36 - right
02:38 - in nested list also we can make one more
02:40 - list and in that list we can put these
02:42 - three lists so that would be a nested
02:44 - list right but what you need to take
02:46 - here here if I enter position 3 2
02:49 - right means third row and second column
02:54 - here I will mark x but
02:58 - these are list and list index start from
03:01 - 0.
03:02 - so when you consider these three lists
03:04 - so index would be 0 1 2 like this
03:08 - right
03:09 - it means this position is
03:11 - same here if these are separate list we
03:16 - like this is room first list this is
03:18 - second list this is third list
03:21 - list one is two
03:24 - list three right and this is
03:29 - final list so this final list is what
03:31 - honest nested list so here also 0 1 2
03:36 - means now 3 2 this position is now where
03:40 - in this list here so this list is third
03:42 - list means here but you can access this
03:44 - list with index 2 not 3.
03:48 - when you will actually access that list
03:51 - or that that index then you have to do
03:54 - minus 1 here you have to do something
03:57 - second and in list three also this is
04:01 - what index 1.
04:03 - but position is 2 but index is one so
04:05 - here I will
04:06 - mark x
04:09 - right
04:11 - so I hope this is not much confusing for
04:14 - you guys and you understand you got this
04:17 - problem statement what I want
04:19 - position we'll ask from the user will
04:21 - take input from the user two digit first
04:24 - digit will specify that row second digit
04:28 - will specify the column you have to take
04:30 - hint I have given you three lists one
04:32 - nested list and how you can access that
04:33 - I have told you
04:35 - okay and after accessing this thing you
04:38 - just put X here
04:40 - that's it and after that you can just
04:43 - print these three lists with Slash in
04:46 - like list one slash and list two slash
04:49 - and list three then it will print in a
04:51 - form of Matrix right so pause the video
04:54 - and try this out please don't directly
04:56 - jump to the solution at least give it a
04:59 - try
05:00 - if you stop somewhere take some break 10
05:02 - to 15 minutes then again try
05:05 - and then go to the solution
05:07 - so I hope you have done this let's
05:09 - create
05:11 - a new file it's a size I guess it's 13
05:14 - Dot py right
05:17 - now we will take three lists first of
05:20 - all right
05:21 - so let's take suppose Row 1 and there
05:25 - I'm going to store
05:27 - one one one
05:29 - or you can like copy and paste Smileys
05:33 - also right you can directly search you
05:36 - can search emojis and from there you can
05:39 - just open this link and
05:42 - from here you can just copy and paste
05:44 - Smileys no see no app required so if you
05:48 - want you can
05:50 - copy and paste these myelins let me just
05:52 - select one
05:56 - like this suppose Row 1 Row 2 and Row 3
05:59 - we have three list and there we have
06:01 - this Smiley right we have just copied
06:03 - and pasted this thing
06:05 - let me just show you how to print it
06:07 - let's you know you have to just write
06:09 - down print that function then F string
06:13 - and there where from where we will
06:16 - access first is Row 1 then we will put a
06:20 - slash n then
06:22 - second variable name is Row 2 I want to
06:24 - access then again slash n and then
06:29 - Row 3 right
06:31 - let me show you if I run this then what
06:34 - output you will get
06:36 - see this is the output
06:39 - right
06:40 - now
06:42 - ask position from the user
06:44 - using input function
06:46 - right first you will take input from the
06:49 - user using input function so we'll ask
06:51 - enter the position
06:56 - where
06:59 - you want to put
07:02 - money
07:04 - or you want to hide your money
07:10 - okay
07:14 - now see if user enter suppose I am
07:18 - entering 3 2.
07:20 - but this 3 2 is now a string using input
07:23 - function whatever we will enter that
07:25 - would be a string so this 3 2 is now a
07:28 - string but we have to separate this
07:30 - three uh and separate this two we want
07:33 - to digit because 3 is for rho and 2 is
07:35 - for column
07:36 - so individual digits we want right so
07:40 - okay we know how to access
07:43 - the elements from a string using
07:45 - indexing we can directly access
07:47 - so
07:48 - the position and zeroth index
07:52 - that would be we have first three from
07:54 - here so that we can
07:57 - this 3 is what row number right so we
08:00 - can put here this thing into a variable
08:03 - name number row number is position zero
08:07 - and
08:09 - column number is
08:14 - position
08:16 - first index so now in row number we have
08:18 - 3 and in column numbers in this variable
08:21 - we have 2 separate we have separate the
08:24 - sound but this thing you need to take
08:26 - care here still this 3 and 2 are strings
08:30 - we haven't converted this into integer
08:33 - right so convert this thing into int
08:37 - have to convert
08:41 - just put here directly
08:44 - int
08:46 - and here also
08:49 - hint
08:50 - right
08:51 - so now in row number we have three that
08:54 - is integer in column number we have two
08:56 - that is
08:57 - also integer okay
09:00 - now
09:02 - okay row number is three means this
09:06 - fine
09:07 - but you have to access this thing so
09:09 - first of all what you need to do you
09:11 - have to do a
09:13 - uh format nested list or the name I can
09:18 - write write down like metrics Matrix
09:22 - equal to
09:23 - first list is Row one
09:27 - then we have Row 2 then we have
09:30 - Row three
09:31 - okay now in Matrix we have Matrix is
09:34 - what now this is nested list because
09:36 - here we have list list and the three
09:40 - list so this is nested list yeah it's
09:42 - possible we can create nested list
09:44 - now I want to access this Row Row 3
09:47 - because row number is 3 this this thing
09:51 - Row 3 first access the row then we will
09:54 - come to column number right but how you
09:57 - can access this this element of this
09:59 - Matrix
10:00 - indexing is what 0 0 1 2 so this Row 3
10:05 - is at second Index right
10:09 - so how we can access this thing the name
10:12 - of this list Matrix
10:14 - and
10:16 - index is 2.
10:18 - so row number minus 1.
10:23 - row number
10:25 - minus 1.
10:28 - now we have accessed this Row 3 right so
10:32 - that I can suppose
10:38 - I am making variable row selected so row
10:41 - selected is now this row okay Matrix row
10:45 - number minus 1. but within this
10:49 - I now I have the row
10:52 - so you have to just select the column in
10:54 - this row column is what second column
10:56 - second column means
10:59 - it would be index one
11:03 - right
11:04 - so here what we can do
11:07 - we have just selected this row so row
11:10 - selected within this row
11:12 - within this selected row which index you
11:15 - want to access which index put the in
11:18 - square bracket which index
11:20 - this column number column number is 2
11:22 - but column number minus 1.
11:24 - because index start from 0.
11:27 - so column number minus 1.
11:30 - so you have selected row within that row
11:33 - I have selected the column also and
11:35 - there what you need to put X so equal to
11:38 - X
11:39 - that's it
11:41 - okay now we will print
11:44 - again
11:46 - we'll print these
11:50 - so just copy paste this thing
11:53 - right I hope you got this code this is
11:56 - not that much tough
11:58 - let's run this
12:00 - okay now this is the original Matrix we
12:02 - have now enter the position where you
12:03 - want to hide your money three two
12:06 - C third row second column here
12:11 - it has marked that position let's run
12:15 - this again
12:17 - where you want to hide your money one
12:18 - one
12:20 - so it has marked X at one one position
12:23 - let's run this again where you want to
12:25 - hide your money
12:27 - suppose two three
12:29 - so two means second row third column
12:33 - so this
12:34 - put an X
12:36 - I hope you got this program
12:39 - if not then please
12:42 - have take some break five to ten minutes
12:45 - then read this program and dry run this
12:49 - program
12:50 - note here
12:51 - write down this on a paper dry on this
12:54 - with the help of pen first this line
12:57 - will be executed this line this line
12:58 - this line with
13:00 - the actual values by putting the actual
13:02 - values then you will get it definitely
13:04 - you will get it right
13:06 - so because in the lecture we will see
13:08 - one more coding exercise that would be
13:11 - little bit tricky trickier than this
13:14 - exercise right so now it's your next few
13:17 - days bye take care
