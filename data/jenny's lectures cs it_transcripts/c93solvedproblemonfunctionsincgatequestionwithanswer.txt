00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:01 - programming we are discussing previous
00:03 - year gate questions on functions in the
00:05 - last video we have discussed one
00:07 - question
00:07 - and in this video we will discuss this
00:09 - question that came into gate 2000 so
00:11 - this the question was
00:13 - you are given a code and
00:15 - you you are asked like what is the value
00:18 - of j
00:19 - what is value of j after the execution
00:22 - of the score this was the question you
00:23 - have to tell value of j
00:25 - right so now we will discuss this
00:26 - question we will try it in this program
00:28 - and i'll show you on my laptop also
00:29 - practically right but before i just want
00:31 - to tell you one thing
00:32 - if you want to build a great career in
00:34 - software development then you must think
00:36 - about the aspects like what's trending
00:37 - in the industry the questions being
00:39 - asked in the interviews what is the
00:41 - thought process behind the great
00:42 - application like amazon flipkart zometo
00:44 - ola and how to improve your code share
00:46 - ranking so here an academy brings you a
00:48 - platform where you can get access to
00:50 - weekly shows which you can watch live
00:52 - and the host of these shows are working
00:54 - in some of the top companies like google
00:55 - linkedin amazon are and are seven star
00:58 - coders on code chef and industry experts
01:01 - with years of experience
01:03 - so here they are going to cover
01:05 - the content which would be really
01:07 - helpful for your career like in the live
01:09 - episodes you can you can get the
01:11 - opportunity to ask take a charge about
01:13 - the top 20 questions being asked and the
01:15 - industry leaders about the recruitment
01:17 - process in top in you know top startups
01:19 - and mncs what is the eligibility
01:21 - criteria and how to apply for them you
01:23 - can also get your resume reviewed by the
01:25 - experts
01:26 - and not only this you can also
01:27 - participate into mock interviews and
01:29 - also learn courses on programming
01:31 - languages cloud computing blockchain and
01:33 - crypto tech aspects of digital marketing
01:36 - and data analytics and there's one more
01:38 - show where adate will cover the
01:39 - comparison in between azure aws and gcp
01:43 - and what are the needs of cloud
01:44 - computing
01:45 - he'll also discuss networking coding
01:48 - devops and the certification for aws
01:52 - so the people this is definitely for the
01:54 - people who are enthusiastic to learn
01:56 - about cloud computing and how the
01:58 - infrastructure of cloud computing works
02:00 - the detail of the show and the badge you
02:02 - will find in the link that i'll put in
02:04 - in the description box of this video and
02:06 - don't forget to use my code jkl10 to get
02:08 - 10 extra discount on your paid
02:10 - subscription
02:11 - so now let's discuss this question this
02:13 - was gate question one mark question
02:15 - right and see whenever you see the code
02:18 - don't just first of all look over
02:20 - overall on the code and see like it's
02:22 - very lengthy how you will solve this no
02:24 - what you need to do you just have to
02:26 - follow the steps and what are the steps
02:28 - when you will execute this thing
02:31 - right first of all where the control
02:32 - will go i hope now everybody know the
02:34 - control will go where to the main
02:36 - function
02:37 - right and one by one just draw what is
02:41 - what is you know what is happening in
02:43 - this program see next line is in i j it
02:45 - means you are declaring two variable i
02:47 - and j it means
02:48 - first of all when
02:50 - it is going to execute some uh two main
02:53 - functions and memory would be located
02:54 - and here we have declared two variable
02:57 - i and j so see if you are a beginner
03:00 - then better to draw something like this
03:02 - step by step what is happening better to
03:04 - draw that thing on your paper on your
03:06 - copy right
03:07 - after that you have if you have
03:08 - practiced many programs then in your
03:10 - mind only in your brain only no need to
03:12 - draw on your paper in your mind only you
03:14 - just imagine this thing and you can
03:15 - solve the question
03:16 - but first better to draw something like
03:18 - this so two variables you have i and j
03:20 - we haven't initialized the variable so
03:22 - some garbage value will be there now
03:23 - next line is for loop now i is equal to
03:25 - zero so in i we have zero condition true
03:28 - zero less than four yes condition true
03:30 - it means control will go here
03:32 - so in for loop we have only one
03:33 - statement that is why we haven't written
03:35 - like that they haven't written those
03:38 - curly braces because
03:40 - in for loop they're just given they have
03:42 - just given one statement now j is equal
03:44 - to this this is what i hope now you are
03:46 - clear this is what function calling
03:48 - right so now now where control will go
03:52 - the definition part of the function here
03:53 - we have the definition part right and
03:56 - once control will go to the definition
03:57 - part means some memory would be
03:59 - allocated to this function also
04:01 - right so now what you are passing here i
04:05 - as an argument now i value is 0 so you
04:07 - are passing 0
04:09 - so this 0 will be received this i by
04:11 - this i so here also we have what one
04:14 - variable i
04:15 - and here also we have zero now enter
04:18 - here now see static in count
04:21 - if i have written in count zero it means
04:24 - you have declared one more variable
04:25 - count and initialized it to it with 0
04:29 - but now they have given one more word
04:31 - that is static what does the static mean
04:35 - static means the lifetime of this
04:37 - variable would be throughout the program
04:39 - and
04:40 - the static variable would be initialized
04:42 - only once
04:45 - whenever you call this function again
04:46 - and again this function will hold sorry
04:49 - this this variable count will hold its
04:52 - previous value
04:53 - you cannot re-initialize the static
04:55 - variable again and again whatever i am
04:57 - saying that you will come to know when
05:00 - we discuss the complete process of this
05:02 - program see
05:04 - now in count also we have 0 count is
05:06 - equal to count plus i count plus i 0
05:08 - plus 0 is zero and that will be stored
05:10 - in count that is zero only now return
05:11 - count it will return zero where the
05:13 - control will go here now here because
05:16 - here you are calling this function so
05:17 - now that zero would be stored in this
05:20 - j
05:20 - right so now in this j we have zero and
05:23 - once control will go out of this
05:25 - function it means what i have told you
05:28 - whatever the variables in this function
05:30 - that has been vanished here we have i
05:32 - and count
05:34 - so this is normal variable so the memory
05:36 - would be freed there is no eye now but
05:38 - count is static variable now see the
05:40 - difference
05:42 - it will hold its value it's not going to
05:46 - destroy it
05:47 - right it will hold zero only
05:49 - right
05:50 - that is why i told you the lifetime of
05:52 - static variables are throughout the
05:54 - program
05:56 - right
05:57 - now see count is still 0
05:59 - now i plus plus
06:02 - i this the size in this main so this i
06:05 - would become 1
06:06 - 1 less than equal to 4 yes condition 2
06:08 - again enter here again
06:10 - call the function again control will go
06:12 - here now again i would be declared here
06:15 - now i will receive what
06:17 - now i value is this time 1 so 1 would be
06:19 - passed so in the side we have 1
06:21 - in count is equal to 0
06:24 - but
06:25 - here previous value is also 0 so we are
06:28 - not going to initialize it
06:30 - right it will hold its previous value
06:32 - only right count plus i one plus zero
06:34 - one that would be stored in count that
06:36 - is one it will return count one it will
06:38 - return
06:39 - so now in j we have one
06:42 - right
06:43 - and once control will go out this
06:45 - variable
06:46 - this memory has been freed but count
06:48 - will still hold its previous value right
06:51 - now
06:52 - i plus plus i becomes 2 condition true
06:54 - again enter here again we are going to
06:56 - call the function and again one variable
06:58 - is i and this i now this time will
07:00 - receive
07:01 - 2
07:02 - but count is not going to initialize
07:04 - again by 0 it will hold its previous
07:05 - value because it's static so 2 plus 3 is
07:08 - 2 plus 1 is 3 3 would be in count now 3
07:11 - it will return 3 now in j we have
07:14 - 3. again i plus plus
07:19 - now i becomes 3
07:22 - condition true again enter again we are
07:23 - going to call this one now i this time
07:27 - this will pass 3 as an argument because
07:29 - i value is 3 so it will receive 3
07:31 - now
07:32 - count plus i 3 plus 3 is 6 so now in
07:35 - count we have 6 it will return
07:37 - 6 now and j at this time we have 6
07:40 - i plus plus i becomes 4 4 less than
07:43 - equal to 4 condition true again enter
07:44 - again we are going to call this function
07:46 - and this time this i will receive 4
07:49 - count plus i 6 plus 4 is 10 now in count
07:52 - we have 10
07:53 - return 10
07:55 - now 10 would be stored in j
07:58 - i plus plus
07:59 - five five less than equal to four no
08:02 - now exit from the for loop
08:06 - and after exiting we just have closing
08:08 - braces right after returning the size no
08:11 - more now
08:12 - right but once exit from the loop exit
08:15 - from the loop means we don't have any
08:17 - statement means the closing braces of
08:19 - main exit from the program and now this
08:21 - count would be vanished and this also
08:23 - vanished
08:25 - but now after completing the execution
08:26 - what is the value of j this was the
08:28 - question so j value is
08:30 - 10
08:32 - right
08:33 - so you can print it because we are not
08:35 - printing any j value here we are not
08:37 - using any printf statement so if you
08:39 - want to see that j value is 10 or not
08:42 - after this for loop here you just print
08:44 - j is equal to percentage
08:46 - d and j
08:47 - let me show you practical also i hope
08:48 - you got the working of this also this
08:50 - question so gate question this is simple
08:53 - question but little bit tricky
08:55 - right
08:56 - let's run this question and see what
08:57 - output you are getting
08:59 - so now see this is the code and we are
09:00 - printing the value of j here in the main
09:03 - just to check what is the value of j
09:04 - after executing this code so now let me
09:06 - run this and check what output you will
09:08 - get
09:09 - cj is equal to 10
09:12 - right so i hope you got the working of
09:13 - this code
09:14 - so in the next video you will also see
09:16 - one more previous year gate question on
09:17 - function so i'll see in the next video
09:18 - till then bye take care
