00:00 - in the previous video we have discussed
00:02 - some project selection tips for
00:04 - beginners right but now in this video
00:06 - I'm going to discuss how to choose a
00:08 - project and some tips for final year
00:11 - students and you can say as well as for
00:13 - pre finally as students right because as
00:16 - we know now yarn you are in final year
00:18 - and you are now going to sit into the
00:21 - placements and your projects are going
00:23 - to play very important role in your
00:25 - placements because you are a fresher and
00:27 - you don't have any experience so what
00:29 - you have to showcase in your resumes
00:32 - your internships any certification and
00:34 - mainly the projects right so your
00:37 - projects you know should be something
00:40 - very new or you can say something very
00:43 - innovative and great something which is
00:46 - and you know it's an eye-catcher for the
00:48 - interviewer right so now I assume that
00:52 - at this point of time if you are in
00:54 - final year then at least you have worked
00:56 - on four to five projects at least right
01:00 - and if you haven't done this thing then
01:03 - this is your biggest mistake right now I
01:06 - assume that if you haven't then if you
01:09 - haven't worked on any project till final
01:11 - year and it's a first project and still
01:14 - if you are in pre final year and if it
01:16 - is your first project then definitely
01:19 - you know you have gained only the
01:21 - theoretical knowledge you have learned
01:24 - the programming language is only to pass
01:25 - out the subjects you haven't gained any
01:28 - exposure any practical exposure and that
01:30 - thing is very important because see now
01:32 - you are in college so I think marks
01:36 - doesn't matter so much your knowledge
01:39 - and skills method right marks I know I
01:44 - am NOT saying that you obviously you
01:47 - have to gain that cutoff marks 65% 70%
01:51 - marks to sit in the placements but it's
01:54 - not like that 94% marks or 95% marks
01:57 - right I hope you are getting my point so
02:01 - you have to you know focus on your
02:03 - skills your knowledge your practical
02:05 - exposure and all these kind of things
02:07 - right so now how to choose the project
02:11 - if you are in final year so I
02:13 - that now obviously you are in finally
02:16 - here you have worked on four to five
02:17 - projects and now you know your area of
02:20 - interest right in which area you want to
02:23 - go so first point is now it's time to
02:27 - beep dive into your area of interest so
02:32 - now here you need you are not supposed
02:34 - to select any simple project you have to
02:37 - do some research some surveys and you
02:39 - have to deep dive into your area of
02:40 - interest right your project should be
02:43 - something very innovative very big and
02:45 - something new right so maybe some common
02:51 - areas or what you can say Android
02:53 - development app development iOS app or
02:55 - game development or website these kind
02:58 - of things right but if you want if you
03:02 - are not going to you know choose a
03:03 - project from this area and you want
03:05 - something different so the trending
03:08 - areas or what you can select cloud
03:11 - computing artificial intelligence
03:14 - blockchain that is very trending
03:16 - nowadays right and cryptography is also
03:20 - good and you can say a women today
03:23 - allottee is also good so you can select
03:24 - any area from this thing right so these
03:28 - are some areas and as well as and
03:30 - machine learning is also in training
03:32 - nowadays so you can select any area now
03:35 - now you have selected the area suppose
03:37 - you have no experience about this area
03:40 - but you want to work you want to do any
03:42 - project in this area right so now your
03:45 - very important point is what generally
03:47 - student ignore these kind of at this
03:49 - point especially you have to choose your
03:52 - guide carefully and your team member
03:55 - also now you know your classmates better
03:58 - and you know who can help you in this
04:00 - kind of project who is good in this area
04:02 - plus your mentor or your guide so now
04:05 - you are in final year or maybe in free
04:06 - pre final year so now you have the idea
04:09 - that which faculty you know as expertise
04:12 - in which area right maybe someone who is
04:15 - teaching cloud computing for cloud
04:16 - computing you can contact to that
04:18 - faculty right or maybe someone some
04:21 - faculty
04:23 - or still pursuing its you know his or
04:25 - her PhD in a particular area so that
04:29 - would be I think to beneficial for you
04:31 - to select those you know faculties as
04:34 - your guide because now they're pursuing
04:37 - their PhD so they are reading many
04:39 - research paper actually right to find
04:41 - out their problem statement or maybe
04:43 - they have found out their problem
04:44 - statements so they can easily help you
04:46 - to find out your problem statements for
04:49 - your project right so please choose your
04:53 - mentor carefully plus after choosing the
04:56 - guide second point is what you have to
04:59 - do regular meetings with your guide you
05:01 - know okay I guess you have four months
05:04 - to work on the project and final year
05:06 - right so please the problem statement
05:09 - the problem finding statement the first
05:12 - stage is very crucial for this maybe
05:16 - it's better to meet your with your guide
05:19 - regularly daily based on daily basis
05:21 - just to finalize your problem statement
05:23 - this is a very important point so it's
05:26 - not like that someone is strict so you
05:29 - are not going to choose that faculty as
05:31 - your guide and someone is cool so you
05:33 - are going to choose that faculty as they
05:34 - write I think you should choose a strict
05:36 - faculty as your guide this is my
05:38 - personal experience right because in
05:40 - that case you will be punctual and
05:41 - disciplined you will meet the faculty
05:43 - though your guide regularly and it is
05:45 - going to help you a lot in your four
05:48 - months right so please take care of this
05:51 - point now you have to read research
05:53 - paper I think the best technique to
05:55 - finalize your statement problem
05:57 - statement is what go through some
05:59 - research paper some recent research
06:01 - paper in that area means you can say
06:03 - from 2010 to 2010 years time span not
06:08 - very old research papers right we
06:11 - central search paper try to read try to
06:13 - find and try to find out the problems
06:15 - and try to implement those research
06:17 - papers maybe your guide will give you
06:19 - that you redress this research paper and
06:21 - come with your problem statement or come
06:24 - you know with your idea what you want to
06:26 - do so yeah I know it's very tough to
06:29 - read a research paper initially if you
06:31 - have read first time that definitely you
06:34 - are not going to get anything but
06:36 - as fine that is normally it happens with
06:38 - everybody when you will read second time
06:40 - third time then you will get something
06:42 - from that research paper fine and try to
06:45 - write down some points also while
06:47 - reading the research paper this is
06:49 - another you know you can say a lengthy
06:52 - topic how to read a research paper
06:54 - definitely I am going to upload a video
06:56 - in this topic but later fine so now I
07:00 - think according to me the best idea is
07:02 - you have to read some research paper in
07:05 - that area and try to implement those
07:08 - research papers fine maybe five or ten
07:11 - or research papers you read and then
07:13 - find out which research paper you can
07:15 - implement or maybe something some
07:18 - research paper you will get future scope
07:20 - right in last heading would be their
07:23 - future scope so in in that you know
07:27 - section they have identified that this
07:29 - is the problem in this research paper or
07:31 - in this research and I am going to do
07:33 - this thing in future so you can develop
07:35 - that thing also if you have got that
07:39 - future scope so you can implement that
07:41 - future scope you can take that future
07:43 - scope as your problem statement and make
07:46 - a project this is a very good idea
07:48 - actually but it is stuff I know it is
07:51 - stuff you have to devote your time fine
07:55 - and as well as now after the project try
07:59 - to publish a research paper that is
08:01 - definitely going to help you if
08:03 - specifically if after your graduation
08:05 - you want to do post graduation right
08:08 - that is definitely going to help you and
08:10 - in placements also in getting placements
08:12 - also if you are published a research
08:14 - paper means you have done something
08:15 - extra right because publishing a
08:18 - research paper is not so easy actually
08:21 - right so I have gone through this
08:24 - experience also maybe someday maybe in
08:27 - some another video I'll share that
08:28 - experience but that is definitely would
08:30 - be a plus point for you publishing a
08:32 - research paper on your project right and
08:34 - now suppose if you want if you don't
08:36 - want to select any this area and you
08:38 - want to work maybe suppose you want to
08:40 - build a website or you can say an app
08:43 - Android app so what you can do see try
08:47 - to learn the
08:49 - and frameworks there in android also
08:52 - everybody knows many frameworks are
08:54 - there so try to learn the recent
08:57 - frameworks and work on those frameworks
08:59 - and use that framework in your project
09:02 - this will show that yes you are a self
09:05 - learner you have done something to learn
09:08 - first of all that framework that is new
09:10 - framework right and after that you have
09:13 - done your project fine rather than just
09:16 - you know taking the common frameworks
09:18 - what everybody is using plus second
09:21 - point is what suppose one student has
09:24 - done in its application his application
09:26 - in Java and analyst another student has
09:29 - used quote link right
09:30 - so definitely quatrain is not in your
09:33 - syllabus and joy wise yeah it is very
09:36 - popular language but it is common
09:37 - language right and it is your curriculum
09:39 - also now definitely I would prefer I
09:42 - would be more interested in that project
09:45 - the student who have worked in Cote Ling
09:47 - because I know that courtliness it's not
09:51 - very easy to learn first of all he or
09:53 - she has learned that language he or she
09:57 - has put his efforts her or her efforts
10:00 - in learning that language and that then
10:03 - used that language in your in his or her
10:07 - project right so try to do these kind of
10:12 - things also or another thing what you
10:14 - can do you can you can merge like if you
10:16 - are developing any app so there you can
10:18 - merge cryptography also encryption and
10:21 - decryption some cryptographic algorithm
10:23 - you can merge two areas and develop
10:26 - something new or in Android you can
10:28 - merge something you know machine
10:31 - learning model right that is also fine
10:34 - so that is also something new right same
10:38 - for web development also you can work on
10:41 - any recent frameworks like react or
10:44 - angular angularjs and these kind of
10:46 - frameworks are very popular nowadays
10:48 - right so you can walk these on these
10:51 - kind of frameworks for your front-end
10:54 - and for back and I I guess nowadays in
10:58 - trending are Django and spring as far as
11:01 - I know
11:02 - some other technologies also there which
11:05 - is in trending so you can comment you
11:08 - can do the comment in the comment box so
11:09 - that so that other can also get some
11:12 - ideas about the trending topics right so
11:15 - the main motto is what you have to
11:18 - search for the trending topics right in
11:21 - your area of interest and next thing is
11:24 - what in your project you should you know
11:28 - implement many functionalities it's not
11:31 - like that your your project is just
11:33 - doing two or three things right so that
11:36 - is also very simple project you have to
11:39 - incorporate many functionalities in your
11:42 - project that first of all this then this
11:44 - it will do this thing then it will load
11:46 - this thing means at least maybe you can
11:48 - say 10 or 15 functionalities right so
11:51 - that is also a good project because see
11:53 - ultimately your project should show your
11:58 - capabilities your skills your
12:01 - aspirations to the interviewer because
12:04 - he or she is very experienced person and
12:06 - by looking at your project and when you
12:09 - explain that project he or she can
12:11 - analyze you that you have devoted this
12:14 - much as this much of time to your
12:15 - project and you have gained what you
12:18 - have gained from that project so
12:20 - definitely a good project is what you
12:22 - have devoted your time at least three to
12:25 - four months in that project and you have
12:28 - gained something from that project
12:30 - something new right you have gained some
12:34 - knowledge from that project it's not any
12:36 - traditional project like management type
12:39 - of projects this is also very important
12:41 - please don't choose the traditional type
12:44 - of projects and if you are choosing then
12:47 - it must have something extraordinary in
12:51 - that project you can just survey the
12:55 - website or the management type of
12:57 - project you are doing about that and you
13:00 - can you know research about that that
13:02 - what extra thing you can do you can add
13:05 - in that website which is very you know
13:09 - eye catcher for the interviewer which
13:11 - will add something which will add
13:14 - something to your project or something
13:16 - your resume right and next step is what
13:18 - I think your project you know should
13:21 - have visualization and it should be
13:23 - interactive right like I have gone
13:26 - through a video there I have you know he
13:28 - has developed a project path finding
13:30 - algorithm means on a map you will select
13:32 - two points source point and destination
13:34 - destination points and suppose you have
13:37 - put some hurdling that you have draw a
13:40 - line this is the hurdle right and he has
13:44 - implemented five to six path finding
13:46 - algorithm Dijkstra bellman-ford and
13:48 - these kind of algorithms and when you
13:50 - select that algorithm then it will you
13:53 - you know it will show the working of
13:55 - that algorithm like a dice trial ever
13:57 - them you select it will show the working
13:59 - properly on the map that how he is going
14:01 - to find the path and finally when he has
14:05 - fine find out the part that algorithm
14:07 - then a line would be drawn like this
14:10 - that this is the shortest path from this
14:12 - to this right so this is also you know
14:15 - good factor if you can add some
14:17 - visualization to your project and it
14:21 - should be directive also so in brief if
14:24 - you ask me some tips for project
14:26 - selection for finally a students or
14:27 - pre-final your students just to go for
14:30 - the trending topics right plus use
14:34 - recent technologies recent frameworks
14:36 - new languages in your project right and
14:39 - please choose your mentor carefully
14:41 - these are very important points your
14:44 - project should show that you have worked
14:48 - hard on your project you have devoted
14:50 - time on your project and you have gained
14:53 - something new from that project you have
14:56 - enhanced your knowledge and skills after
14:59 - working on that project right don't go
15:03 - for the traditional and simple project
15:05 - please in final year and try to publish
15:08 - a research paper at least one research
15:10 - paper in International Journal or any
15:13 - conference on your project right so
15:17 - that's it for this video now I'm going
15:19 - to see you in the next video till then
15:20 - bye-bye take care
