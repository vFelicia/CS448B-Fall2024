00:00 - so in this video we are going to discuss
00:01 - some tips and tricks about how to finish
00:04 - your exam you see net exam specially
00:06 - paper one within timeframe within 60
00:10 - minutes means how to solve maximum
00:12 - questions within 60 minutes right
00:14 - because many equations many students
00:17 - have this complain that we have prepared
00:19 - very well for paper one also for paper
00:21 - two also but specially in paper one
00:24 - because of less time we were not able to
00:26 - solve many questions and because of that
00:27 - we were not able to clear the net exam
00:30 - because of this time management only
00:34 - right so I am going to share my
00:36 - experience also what I used to a follow
00:39 - when I generally go for exam any online
00:41 - exam because as we know that now UGC is
00:45 - conducting this exam online it is
00:47 - computer-based right before it was
00:49 - offline yeah when I I have given this
00:52 - exam that and at that time it is offline
00:54 - it was offline actually but I have gone
00:56 - through many online exams as well so I
00:57 - am going to share my experiences so what
00:59 - I use to follow at that time so that you
01:02 - can get maximum you can solve maximum
01:03 - questions in within that time frame it's
01:07 - not like that your questions are C for
01:10 - paper 150 questions are there right and
01:13 - 60 minutes and for paper - you have 100
01:18 - questions and write 120 minutes means
01:21 - total 150 questions are there and you
01:25 - will get 180 minutes three hours before
01:30 - within paper one and paper - there was
01:33 - some gap gap of I think 30 minutes but
01:36 - now it's single duration you will get 33
01:41 - yards and you have to solve 150
01:43 - questions it is not compulsory that you
01:46 - have to submit paper one within 60
01:49 - minutes right and after that you will
01:51 - solve paper - there is I think no such
01:54 - boundary but still still you have to
01:58 - just devote only 60 minutes to paper one
02:02 - it's not like that if there is no
02:04 - boundary
02:05 - no boundary of submission then you will
02:08 - devote one hour on 10 minutes and 15
02:10 - minutes so just paper one and after that
02:12 - you solve the
02:13 - - no just keep this thing in your mind
02:17 - just you have 60 minutes for 50
02:20 - questions not even 61 minutes right and
02:24 - 120 minutes you have to devote for paper
02:27 - - and each question is of two marks so
02:30 - total marks 300 marks would be there
02:33 - right so first thing you need to take
02:36 - care as of what please before going to
02:41 - the final exam please practice the
02:44 - online mock test because paper 1 is what
02:47 - general paper so these tricks whatever I
02:49 - am going to tell you will be applied to
02:51 - every student right so many of you are
02:53 - you know maybe from those who are from
02:55 - computer background or many other
02:57 - students also familiar with computers
02:58 - they can deal you know they can answer
03:01 - the questions they can read the question
03:02 - on the screen and they can answer the
03:04 - question they're familiar will be in in
03:06 - dealing with computers they have
03:08 - practiced generally the students who are
03:10 - having computer background they have
03:13 - practiced many more tests maybe not from
03:16 - UGC net some other test also any
03:19 - aptitude test or any other test on
03:21 - computer so they are familiar with the
03:22 - process if you are not familiar with the
03:24 - process how to solve the questions on
03:26 - computer how to read the questions how
03:29 - the questions would be displayed what
03:31 - options you will have at that time so I
03:35 - would suggest to all the students
03:37 - whether you have some computer
03:38 - background or any other background
03:39 - please practice that Moke test that on
03:43 - the website of UGC net would be given
03:45 - online mock test so that you will get
03:48 - familiar with how the question would be
03:51 - displayed what four options would be
03:53 - there like 7 next for review save and
03:57 - review just mark and next and well the
04:01 - next would be displayed how to go to the
04:03 - how to switch to the next question how
04:05 - to submit where the submit button is
04:07 - there how to submit the exam right and
04:09 - if you have answered the questions then
04:14 - there would be on that question like
04:16 - this is the first question so there
04:18 - would be green shade on that questions
04:22 - suppose second question you haven't
04:24 - answered and you just click on next
04:26 - that would be red means you haven't
04:29 - answered these questions if you have
04:30 - suppose just click the button save and
04:36 - review means you have answered the
04:39 - question but you are not you are not
04:40 - sure about that you want to review that
04:42 - question in at last so that would be
04:45 - some different color would be there or
04:47 - if you have just suppose you have on the
04:50 - fourth question you have just clicked
04:51 - the button mark for review so that would
04:53 - be some different color in different
04:54 - color and there would be the meaning of
04:57 - each and every color so four categories
04:59 - would be there so these four categories
05:01 - of I think questions would be there you
05:04 - have answered the questions mean that
05:05 - would be green you haven't answered the
05:07 - question that would be red you have
05:09 - answered means save the question but
05:13 - mark for review that would be also a
05:15 - button so that would be in different
05:17 - color this is mark for review that would
05:20 - be in different color so at last you
05:22 - have the idea that how many questions
05:25 - you have answered and how many are still
05:27 - untouched you have just skipped like
05:31 - this so that you can review and the last
05:33 - so this thing is very important
05:36 - please get you familiar with this thing
05:39 - with the demo with the mock test right
05:42 - how actually the paper would be there in
05:45 - front of you have you how to answer the
05:46 - questions the meaning of different
05:49 - colors and everything where the timer
05:51 - would be there where your name would be
05:53 - there so that at that time when you will
05:55 - go for the exam you will be you know
05:57 - less nervous at that time because you in
06:00 - its if you will see everything the first
06:03 - time then it would be you know you you
06:06 - will need some time to figure out that
06:08 - the meaning of everything and if you
06:10 - just the questions you have answered
06:13 - means you have just click Save and next
06:17 - means you have answered the questions
06:19 - those would be counted at the last if
06:22 - you have saved the question and mark for
06:24 - review you have done if that's this
06:27 - thing your answers would not be counted
06:29 - at the last right that√≠s why you have to
06:33 - review your answers in the last so at
06:37 - least reserve your five to seven men
06:40 - it's to review the paper right at last
06:43 - means for paper one five to seven
06:45 - minutes right and four-foot paper to ten
06:48 - to fifteen minutes just to review your
06:50 - answers right because see it is
06:52 - impossible to answer all the 50
06:55 - questions correctly within 60 minutes
06:58 - some questions would be definitely be
07:00 - unanswered some questions would be there
07:02 - in which you are in dilemma and you have
07:06 - saved the answer but you have just
07:07 - marked those questions for review so
07:10 - within these five to seven minutes and
07:12 - last you have to attempt all the
07:15 - questions because third very important
07:19 - point is what there is no negative
07:20 - marking so please attempt all the
07:23 - questions if you think that almost you
07:26 - have completed 30 to 35 questions and
07:30 - you are sure that at least 30 questions
07:34 - are correct means you will get 60 about
07:36 - 60 marks right in paper 1 so that is
07:39 - fine that is considered as a very good
07:41 - score so now you are left with suppose
07:44 - 15 questions that are unanswered or
07:47 - maybe some questions are for review so
07:49 - it lasts within 5 to 7 or 10 minutes
07:52 - just mark all the questions answered by
07:57 - just guessing the answers you no need to
07:59 - you know for unanswered questions
08:02 - because you know you don't know the
08:04 - answer of these questions so no need to
08:06 - read the question just mark either a B C
08:09 - D or whatever status you apply like je
08:11 - method or anything but you have to
08:14 - answer all the questions in the last
08:16 - that is why I'm saying you I am telling
08:19 - you that reservior at least 5 to 7
08:22 - minutes
08:22 - in lust so that you can answer the
08:24 - unanswered questions also now next step
08:27 - is know how to answer the questions
08:29 - right see some sections are very
08:32 - time-consuming like I think specially bi
08:35 - the reading comprehension and reasoning
08:38 - right these are some time-consuming
08:40 - sections and theoretical units are like
08:42 - teaching aperture research aptitude
08:44 - communication ICT higher education
08:47 - Indian politics and government policies
08:50 - these are what these are theoretical
08:52 - questions so
08:53 - so my suggestion would be what please do
08:57 - not try to solve these questions first
08:59 - so try to attempt those section first
09:02 - which are less time-consuming and which
09:05 - are easy for you in which you are strong
09:08 - like when you read that question then
09:11 - within five to seven seconds or within
09:13 - 10 seconds you will come to know that
09:16 - can you answer the questions or not
09:18 - right
09:19 - some questions would be like that just
09:21 - by reading once within 5 to 7 seconds
09:24 - and you will get the answer just mark
09:27 - and save and next right if you think
09:32 - that you cannot solve that questions
09:34 - just leave it do no to waste much time
09:38 - on a single question because on an
09:43 - average for each question you have just
09:44 - one minute in paper one right
09:47 - please do not take it on your ego that I
09:51 - have practiced this section very much
09:53 - right so I have to solve those questions
09:56 - sometimes in the questions would be
09:58 - tricky and you will not get the answer
10:00 - just you will waste your time please do
10:04 - not waste your time on a single question
10:05 - that is what I am saying you write so in
10:07 - one go from 1 to 50 solve these
10:10 - questions right like you think that
10:12 - within 5 to 7 seconds some questions
10:14 - would be there within 5 to 7 seconds
10:16 - you'll get the answer just save and next
10:18 - by reading the answer by reading the
10:21 - question one time you think that yeah
10:23 - you can devote 10 to 15 seconds more or
10:27 - within 20 or within 30 seconds you will
10:30 - get the answer so try to solve that
10:31 - questions and now at the same time
10:34 - within that first go only when you are
10:37 - going from 1 to 50 like you think that
10:39 - di questions reading comprehension
10:41 - question reasoning questions you are
10:43 - good at these things but they will take
10:46 - some time more than 30 seconds right
10:49 - means within one minute or maybe 1
10:52 - minute 10 seconds within 10 seconds you
10:54 - can solve these questions so you can
10:56 - mark those questions hard mark for
10:59 - review right that would be I think in
11:01 - purple or blue color so that in the last
11:05 - when you have answered from
11:07 - one two fifty some questions would be
11:09 - answered green some question will be an
11:10 - answer that is you don't know the answer
11:12 - that are red some questions may be like
11:15 - you know the answer but you just want to
11:17 - review so just press save and mark for
11:20 - review and some answers some questions
11:22 - would be like di in reasoning that
11:24 - they'll need some time you know the
11:26 - answer you can solve the question but
11:28 - they'll need some time so you can mark
11:30 - for review those questions so I think
11:32 - within 20 to 25 minutes you can do this
11:34 - thing right now it's time to solve these
11:37 - type of questions see from di you will
11:41 - get five questions but at least two
11:43 - questions would be very easy you can
11:45 - solve those questions very easily right
11:47 - so try to solve those questions first
11:50 - like Mark for review questions you can
11:52 - click on that like for question is
11:55 - marked for review and that question
11:56 - would be in front of your screen write
11:58 - at least two questions from di would be
12:00 - very easy
12:01 - solve those questions at least two
12:03 - questions would be from reading
12:05 - comprehension that would be very easy
12:07 - try to show those questions from
12:10 - reasoning also logical reasoning max
12:12 - reasoning ten question would be there so
12:13 - maybe at least five questions would be
12:15 - there that you can solve easily maybe
12:18 - within one minute so try to solve those
12:20 - questions yeah those two or three
12:24 - questions that are tough you can leave
12:26 - right now those questions it's not like
12:28 - that for comprehension first of all read
12:30 - the passage right then read the
12:32 - questions so obviously at that time you
12:35 - know we are not we are nervous and the
12:37 - timer is ticking in your mind in front
12:38 - of you so it's not like that you have
12:41 - read the CIM that passage and you have
12:44 - remembered everything and now you can
12:45 - answer the question so it's better do
12:48 - note I think do not waste your time by
12:50 - reading the passage first first read the
12:52 - question write at least two question
12:54 - would be very easy the answer of those
12:56 - questions you will get within two three
12:57 - or four lines first two three four lines
13:00 - over the passage read the question first
13:02 - two questions and try to find the
13:04 - answers then read the passage after
13:06 - reading the questions that is my
13:08 - personal experience in my personality
13:10 - and you will get the answer very easily
13:13 - right same for reasoning now next comes
13:17 - to save and mark for review
13:20 - try to review those questions again
13:22 - right but now you are not supposed to
13:25 - leave any question like save and Matsu
13:27 - review for later because you don't have
13:29 - time so just save and next right means
13:33 - you have answered that questions now
13:35 - only questions would be remaining I
13:38 - think within 20 minutes you can do this
13:41 - thing now last I guess 15 minutes are
13:43 - left and your answers are now questions
13:47 - are now I red flag means you have the
13:50 - questions remaining questions are
13:51 - unanswered so now one by one obviously
13:55 - you have 15 minutes one by one
13:57 - read the question if you have 15 minutes
13:59 - if you really don't know the answer
14:01 - don't waste the time just mark any
14:03 - answer and if in this case like
14:06 - reasoning or comprehension or di if you
14:09 - still think that those are remaining two
14:12 - to three questions that are tough you
14:13 - have left those questions those you can
14:16 - solve within one minute or two minute so
14:19 - try to solve those questions right and
14:22 - if you don't know the answer just take
14:24 - any answer for that but you haven't you
14:28 - are not supposed to lift any question
14:30 - now at this time in last 15 minutes
14:33 - unanswered or save for review
14:35 - you have to attempt every question now
14:38 - within 60 minutes now every question is
14:41 - having your green color means you have
14:44 - answered every question so I think the
14:46 - main point here is what at first please
14:50 - try to solve those questions in which
14:53 - you are sure and you think that you can
14:55 - get the answer within 30 to 35 seconds
14:58 - maybe these questions are from reasoning
15:00 - also reasoning from reasonable so there
15:03 - are some very simple questions and you
15:04 - can get the answer within 30 seconds so
15:06 - you can solve those questions it's not
15:07 - like that it's reasoning you have to
15:09 - solve after you know after 20 or 25
15:11 - seconds if I have said that just leave
15:14 - these portions first and after that soul
15:16 - maybe comprehension also just read the
15:19 - first or second in one go only just read
15:21 - first and second question and if you
15:24 - think that you can get the answer within
15:26 - 30 seconds by reading just two or three
15:28 - lines first you can answer those
15:30 - questions also within one go during the
15:33 - first
15:34 - from 1 to 50 right but please do not
15:38 - waste your time much time at starting on
15:41 - those questions in which you are not
15:43 - sure and those who will take more than
15:46 - one minute to solve next important tip
15:49 - is what see if state you are reading the
15:53 - questions from first then second
15:55 - question then third and fourth fifth
15:57 - sixth and suppose first six to seven
16:01 - question or eight questions you are you
16:02 - are not able to solve means you don't
16:04 - know the answer and you have left
16:05 - unanswered so at that time many students
16:08 - you know get stressed and many students
16:11 - get nervous like I haven't attempted
16:14 - first six to seven questions or eight
16:17 - questions now well what what will I do
16:19 - please don't do this thing there are
16:21 - many questions left at starting
16:24 - obviously your mind you have to set your
16:26 - mind at that time everything is new you
16:29 - have you have to solve your progression
16:31 - within 60 minutes and obviously you are
16:34 - little bit nervous so you will get 1 2
16:37 - minutes or 3 minutes to be familiar with
16:39 - that situation so that is totally fine
16:43 - it's ok if you haven't answered the
16:46 - first 6 7 questions for 8 questions in
16:49 - starting it's ok it happens you have to
16:52 - just remain at that time cool and you
16:55 - have to just focus your full
16:58 - concentration would be on reading the
17:00 - question just read that question with
17:03 - full concentration and with fully
17:06 - focused on that question right it's not
17:08 - like that to get that question you have
17:10 - to read that question two or three times
17:12 - or four times please do not do this
17:14 - thing right read that question in such a
17:18 - way that in first read only you get that
17:22 - you can answer the question or you
17:23 - cannot answer the question and trust me
17:25 - it's very easy to get 60 plus marks in
17:27 - paper one if you have prepared if you
17:30 - have just devoted sincerely at least 15
17:33 - days for preparing of paper 1 and if you
17:37 - have managed your time in attempting the
17:40 - paper 1 during your finally I think with
17:44 - the preparation how to attempt the
17:46 - question during
17:47 - your final day during your exam that is
17:49 - also very important so that's it for
17:51 - this video now I'm going to see in the
17:53 - next video till then bye bye take care
