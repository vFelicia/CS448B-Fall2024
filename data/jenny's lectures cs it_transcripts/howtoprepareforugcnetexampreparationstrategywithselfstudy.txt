00:00 - i have got many questions regarding the
00:02 - preparation
00:03 - strategy for ugc net exam as well as in
00:06 - comment box and
00:07 - in my instagram account also in messages
00:10 - right
00:10 - like how to prepare for using net exam
00:12 - how much time we should devote can we
00:14 - crack the exam without coaching
00:16 - means only with self-study or
00:19 - in a day how many hours we should study
00:22 - to crack
00:22 - ugnet exam right so i'm going to answer
00:25 - these questions in this video
00:27 - like how to prepare for ugc net exam
00:30 - this is specifically for computer
00:31 - science students
00:32 - so yes you can crack net exam with self
00:36 - study only without
00:37 - any coaching right now in a day how many
00:40 - hours you should
00:41 - study or to crack this exam see it
00:44 - depends
00:44 - how many uh you know months you have to
00:47 - prepare
00:48 - like if you have suppose only two months
00:49 - or one month or if you have five to six
00:51 - months it depends on that time
00:53 - right i am just going to tell you how to
00:55 - prepare for using
00:56 - net exam according to that you can
00:58 - decide like how much time you have to
01:00 - devote
01:01 - to prepare each day to prepare for this
01:03 - exam because there are categories of
01:05 - people who are preparing for net exam
01:07 - first is what maybe you are doing your
01:09 - post graduation right in final year of
01:11 - your post graduation you have just
01:13 - recently done your post graduation or
01:15 - maybe you are
01:16 - in job maybe in teaching jobs in some
01:19 - other job
01:19 - right or maybe you are a dropout you
01:22 - haven't touched these
01:23 - subjects computer science subjects may
01:25 - be from since last two three
01:27 - years or five years and now we are going
01:29 - to prepare
01:30 - so according to that you have to take
01:32 - time like suppose if
01:33 - you are in your post graduation you are
01:35 - still studying
01:37 - in that case obviously you have gone
01:39 - through all the subjects you are still
01:41 - studying so
01:42 - you will take less time to prepare right
01:44 - or
01:45 - in case if you are in teaching job in
01:47 - that case also you are
01:48 - you will take less time to prepare for
01:50 - this exam because you are already
01:51 - teaching those subjects you have the
01:53 - experience
01:54 - right if you have drop out you haven't
01:57 - touched the subjects
01:58 - since you know last two three years five
02:01 - years in that case obviously you need
02:03 - more time
02:04 - so according to that you have to decide
02:07 - how much time you require it's not like
02:10 - that generally
02:11 - i would say eight hours or three hours
02:14 - or
02:15 - one month time two months time or six
02:17 - months time or one year time
02:19 - generally i can't say this thing it
02:21 - depends on person to person actually
02:23 - but obviously you are appearing for this
02:25 - exam so you must have done your post
02:27 - graduation or you are in your post
02:29 - graduation
02:30 - so you have gone through the core
02:32 - computer science subjects in your b tech
02:34 - and you are
02:34 - in your mtech so generally it takes
02:38 - four to five months to prepare for this
02:41 - exam
02:42 - just by devoting eight hours per day
02:45 - right seven to eight hours per day or
02:47 - maybe
02:48 - someone can prepare in last two months
02:50 - by devoting more hours
02:52 - maybe you are smart enough and you can
02:54 - prepare in last two months also in that
02:55 - case also you can crack this exam it's
02:57 - not a big deal
02:58 - it's not like that you cannot you cannot
03:00 - prepare in two months you
03:01 - need at least four to five months it's
03:03 - not like that
03:04 - right so now very first thing is you
03:07 - should have a hard copy of the syllabus
03:10 - right first of all read out which
03:13 - subjects are there
03:14 - around i think around 70 around
03:18 - 19 subject or we can say around 20
03:20 - subjects are there in
03:21 - net exam right around 20 i'm not saying
03:24 - exactly 20 subjects but as far as i
03:27 - remember it's around 20 subjects
03:30 - so you should go through those subjects
03:32 - the topic wise
03:33 - this this topic is there and many
03:37 - subjects you have gone through
03:39 - in your b tech and m tech few subjects
03:41 - are there maybe you are not aware about
03:43 - second thing you have to decide the
03:46 - weightage of the
03:47 - subjects means some subjects are there
03:50 - from
03:51 - where you will get five to six questions
03:53 - some subjects are there from where you
03:55 - will get only one to two questions
03:57 - right so you have to focus on those
04:00 - subjects
04:00 - with higher weightage you have to
04:02 - prepare those subjects thoroughly you
04:04 - have to prepare those subject
04:05 - first you have to devote more time for
04:08 - those subjects
04:09 - now how you are going to analyze the
04:10 - weightage of subjects
04:13 - according to the previous year question
04:14 - paper right
04:16 - download the previous year question
04:17 - papers yeah i know
04:19 - ah i think before 2017 three
04:22 - papers were there but now only two
04:24 - papers are there paper one and paper two
04:26 - paper one is
04:27 - general paper that thing we will discuss
04:29 - about paper on everything we'll discuss
04:31 - in next video
04:32 - this is about paper two and paper two
04:35 - around
04:35 - you will have around twenty subjects so
04:38 - download the previous year question
04:39 - papers
04:40 - right after 17 you download the paper
04:44 - like i have appeared in july 18 and i
04:47 - clarified
04:48 - the net exam in july 18. so at that time
04:51 - paper two
04:51 - two papers for their paper one and paper
04:53 - two only i'm going to share my
04:56 - uh you know experience and my strategy
04:58 - also in this video
05:00 - so download the previous year question
05:02 - paper analyze those
05:04 - papers and decide from which subjects
05:06 - how many questions are there
05:08 - like from dsa five to six question would
05:10 - be there from computer networks also
05:12 - five to six question would be there
05:13 - right some core computer science
05:15 - subjects like toc
05:17 - from there also five to six six
05:18 - questions would be there in net exam
05:20 - i think um maybe i think a linear
05:23 - programming ah
05:25 - subject is there from there only you
05:26 - will get only one or two questions
05:28 - hardly
05:29 - so if you are doing self study you have
05:30 - to do it yourself first
05:32 - do these two points after that you start
05:35 - preparation it's not like that
05:37 - just pick up the textbook and start
05:39 - reading right
05:40 - no you have to prepare you have to plan
05:43 - everything
05:45 - and within each subjects also you have
05:47 - to decide
05:48 - the topics it's not like that you have
05:50 - to cover the entire
05:53 - subject according to the syllabus those
05:56 - topics
05:56 - and from which topic the weightage of
05:58 - the topic also from which topic
06:00 - every time there would be a question
06:02 - that you know will be there in the
06:03 - net exam so you have to decide that
06:06 - thing also
06:07 - this is also very important like you
06:09 - have you are not supposed to read the
06:11 - entire book
06:13 - right you have to decide the topics
06:15 - according to that you have to read
06:17 - and you are not supposed to go in
06:21 - deep of that subject because in
06:24 - udc net exam they ask
06:28 - it's not like that they'll ask very
06:29 - tough questions high level questions no
06:32 - the you know some questions would be of
06:34 - easy level very easy level some question
06:37 - would be of intermediate level medium
06:39 - level
06:40 - so you are not supposed to go in deep of
06:42 - every subject
06:43 - right and this thing how you will get
06:45 - you have to analyze the previous year
06:47 - question
06:48 - paper that is very important now here
06:50 - one point i would say you are not
06:52 - supposed to
06:53 - you know cover the entire syllabus or
06:56 - each subject right if you are fighting
07:00 - for the first rank obviously you have to
07:02 - cover
07:03 - each and everything every subject every
07:05 - topic
07:06 - but generally just to clarify the
07:10 - jrf exam assistant professor plus jrf
07:12 - and you are
07:13 - you don't need to complete you don't
07:15 - need to study the each and every subject
07:18 - like if 20 subjects are there just maybe
07:21 - 16 to 17 subjects are
07:23 - enough to read so don't try to cover the
07:27 - entire slavers
07:29 - that is my personal tip because
07:32 - when i was preparing for net exam i have
07:34 - covered only
07:35 - i think 15 subjects main main subjects
07:38 - not the
07:39 - entire syllabus and why i am saying this
07:42 - thing because obviously there are
07:43 - suppose
07:44 - if you go for 15 subjects so at least
07:48 - three subjects you have to prepare in
07:50 - one month only at least
07:52 - three subjects right and some subjects
07:55 - are
07:55 - vast syllabuses asked and some subjects
07:58 - are obviously
07:59 - not very lengthy so you have to decide
08:03 - some subjects are there in which you are
08:05 - good right
08:06 - and like dsa subjects maybe you are good
08:09 - or you find
08:10 - any good material from anywhere like i
08:12 - have uploaded many videos on dsa so that
08:14 - has
08:15 - that are also very good very helpful in
08:17 - preparing
08:18 - net and gate exam so prepare those
08:20 - subject first
08:22 - in which you have the confidence you
08:24 - know something about that subject
08:26 - and the subject having higher weightage
08:28 - from the subject which
08:30 - from where you will get five to six
08:31 - questions try to cover those subject
08:33 - first you can leave two or three
08:36 - subjects from which you will get only
08:38 - one to two questions that's not a big
08:39 - deal
08:40 - like i have covered only the main main
08:42 - subjects like
08:43 - data structure algorithm graph theory
08:45 - computer networks
08:47 - operating system dbms and
08:51 - discrete mathematics digital electronics
08:53 - microprocessor
08:54 - these subjects i have prepared i haven't
08:56 - read the complete textbook of the
08:59 - you know each subject but according to
09:01 - those labels i have covered the topics
09:04 - and this is also very important point
09:07 - while you are preparing while
09:08 - while you are studying you have to
09:10 - prepare your own notes
09:12 - that is going to help you very much
09:14 - while you revise
09:16 - see revision is also very important
09:19 - you have to devote at least 20 days
09:22 - and if you have enough time like six
09:24 - months then you can devote
09:26 - one month last one month for a reason
09:28 - and five months for preparation
09:30 - if you have support three to four months
09:32 - like so in last 15 to 20 days
09:34 - for revision but please don't skip this
09:37 - thing this is also very important and
09:39 - your notes
09:40 - will be very helpful while you revise
09:43 - the concepts
09:44 - and small tip would be there while
09:46 - preparing notes
09:48 - what i generally used to do use two or
09:51 - three colored
09:52 - pen or marker to highlight something
09:56 - important
09:57 - to highlight some formulas or some short
09:59 - tricks or
10:00 - something you think that it think that
10:02 - it's very important you have to revise
10:04 - that thing so that while you revise
10:06 - those concept then that will be
10:09 - you know in your focus if you will
10:11 - prepare your notes with
10:13 - only one pen like blue pen then it's
10:15 - hard to revise at that time
10:17 - because you have less time to revise you
10:19 - can do one thing
10:21 - it if suppose any line is very important
10:23 - you can do what
10:24 - you can you know write that line
10:27 - within or you can that formula within
10:29 - this rectangular or within a box
10:32 - to highlight that thing or you can use a
10:34 - marker this thing is
10:36 - really going to help you in revision and
10:39 - next
10:40 - very important point is what you have to
10:42 - practice smoke test
10:44 - or you can say you have to solve the
10:46 - previous year question paper
10:48 - suppose for paper two you have
10:49 - downloaded the previous year question
10:51 - paper
10:51 - or maybe you have supposed some work
10:52 - test or test series of any coaching
10:54 - institute
10:55 - so what you have to do just set for two
10:59 - hours because
11:00 - for paper two you have to devote two
11:02 - hours right
11:03 - and within those two hours try to solve
11:06 - that question paper paper two just
11:10 - it's just for your rehearsal right and
11:12 - that is very important
11:15 - before sitting in the exam you must have
11:17 - to do
11:18 - this thing in this case
11:21 - what you will come to know your weak
11:23 - points how much time
11:25 - in two hours only how many questions you
11:27 - can solve
11:28 - because this is very important many
11:30 - students
11:31 - have this complaint that
11:34 - they were you know they know how to
11:36 - solve that questions they
11:37 - have practiced very much but because of
11:41 - less time they were not able to solve
11:43 - all the hundred questions
11:45 - right yeah obviously it is very tough to
11:48 - solve hundred question in just
11:50 - two hours but try to solve as many as
11:52 - you can right
11:53 - and this thing how you will come into
11:56 - you
11:57 - by practice only so this is also very
11:59 - important you have to practice
12:01 - previous year question paper right it's
12:04 - not like that
12:05 - you will not have any time limit you
12:08 - have to just solve the questions
12:09 - no just set the time limit of two hours
12:12 - and see within two hours how many
12:14 - questions you can solve
12:15 - this is definitely going to increase
12:17 - your speed
12:19 - the time management skills and this is
12:21 - definitely going to help you while
12:22 - solving the
12:23 - question paper that thing also will
12:25 - discuss in next video
12:27 - like how to manage the time how to
12:28 - attempt the questions what
12:30 - general mistakes students do so this is
12:32 - what you have to do after completing
12:34 - your
12:34 - subjects right but see
12:38 - when you have covered any topic from a
12:40 - subject
12:41 - after completing that topic it's better
12:44 - to do
12:44 - to practice some questions from previous
12:46 - year question paper
12:47 - right so that just reading out or just
12:50 - learning the topic is not sufficient
12:52 - at that time only you have to you know
12:55 - practice the questions
12:56 - maybe at least five questions on that
12:59 - topic that is definitely going to help
13:01 - you in last
13:02 - and while preparing this thing your
13:05 - consistency is
13:06 - very important consistency you can say
13:09 - regularity it's not like that
13:11 - one day i'll study for 10 hours or 12
13:13 - hours after
13:14 - then two or three days i'm not going to
13:16 - study after that i'm again going to
13:18 - study for 10
13:19 - hours or 12 hours no devote
13:22 - maybe five hours eight hours a day
13:25 - but you should be consistent daily you
13:28 - have to study
13:29 - eight hours or five hours how many hours
13:31 - you decide it it's up to you
13:33 - my suggestion would be eight hours per
13:36 - day
13:36 - so now this eight hours you can decide
13:38 - up to you may be some hours
13:40 - four hours in evening four hours in
13:41 - morning or it's up to you how you are
13:43 - going to do it this time you can decide
13:45 - it yourself
13:46 - but at least i try to uh take some gap
13:49 - or some rest
13:50 - like suppose for two hours then after 10
13:52 - minutes you will take some rest or gap
13:54 - it's not like that continuously for
13:56 - eight hours you are studying
13:58 - you will be exhausted at that time so
14:00 - you have to take rest
14:02 - also in between plus you can also
14:04 - practice previous year question paper of
14:06 - any other exams like gate isro or
14:09 - d triple s b or many exams are there if
14:11 - you have time
14:12 - right because obviously the syllabus
14:14 - would be same and in gate they'll ask
14:16 - high level questions and if you are able
14:18 - to solve those questions then definitely
14:19 - you can solve
14:21 - net questions because the level of
14:23 - questions of
14:24 - net exam would be less than the level of
14:27 - the
14:27 - question asked in gate exam so these are
14:31 - some preparation
14:32 - tips but after this preparation
14:35 - one thing which is very important is how
14:38 - you are going to attempt the questions
14:40 - on your final day on your d-day that is
14:42 - also going to play very important role
14:44 - the time management during your
14:47 - exam that thing we will discuss in next
14:49 - video and about paper one also how to
14:51 - prepare that thing also we'll discuss in
14:52 - next video because paper one is also
14:54 - very important if you wanna score
14:56 - high it's not like that you can just you
14:59 - just focus on the paper too and
15:01 - a paper one is very easy or paper one
15:04 - it's not like that it is
15:05 - not very important and you just leave
15:06 - that paper one or all the topics of
15:09 - paper one
15:10 - that is also very important so that we
15:12 - will discuss in next video
15:14 - so now i'm going to see you in the next
15:15 - video till then bye take care
