00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in this video we'll be
00:04 - discussing top seven programming
00:05 - languages to learn in 2024 or we can say
00:08 - top seven programming languages to learn
00:10 - for future the programming languages
00:12 - which are having great scope in future
00:15 - right if you're are a beginner or if you
00:17 - have some knowledge of like you know
00:19 - coding and still you are confused like
00:21 - which programming languages you should
00:22 - learn first or your are second
00:24 - programming language or third
00:26 - programming language then this video is
00:28 - definitely for you because in this video
00:30 - we'll be discussing all these things the
00:32 - one by one number one programming
00:34 - language second third like this and uh
00:37 - drawbacks and you can say benefits or
00:40 - advantages of learning each and every
00:41 - programming language and the application
00:43 - of each language in which field these
00:44 - programming language are being used all
00:47 - these things we'll be discussing in this
00:49 - video right one by one but before that
00:52 - just want to tell you one thing if you
00:54 - are a gate aspir if you are preparing
00:56 - for gate 2025 then gfg Geeks for geeks
01:00 - is going to start batches for gate
01:03 - preparation interactive live and
01:06 - self-based courses for gate preparation
01:08 - for computer science for uh uh you know
01:11 - gate data science and artificial
01:13 - intelligence let me just show you don't

04:11 - details I'll put in the description box
04:13 - of this video you can go and register
04:15 - from there because it's better to start
04:17 - early right so now back to the topic so
04:20 - the first language I would recommend is
04:21 - go for python because it is very easy
04:23 - language to learn syntax is very simple
04:26 - you will feel like you are writing in
04:27 - English simple English language so if
04:29 - you are a beginner you don't know
04:31 - anything about coding you can go for
04:33 - Python language and it would be easy for
04:34 - you guys to learn this language right
04:37 - and it has gained so much popularity in
04:38 - recent year year and it is still gaining
04:41 - popularity right and especially if you
04:44 - are interested in those artificial
04:46 - intelligence machine learning field data
04:48 - science field automation then definitely
04:50 - this is your
04:51 - language this is the only language you
04:53 - should go for right and these are
04:55 - obviously trending field the future of
04:58 - technology machine learning data science
05:00 - AI right so if you are interested in
05:03 - this field definitely pick Python
05:04 - language right there are so many
05:06 - libraries here numai pandas for dealing
05:10 - with large set of data tensor flow skyfi
05:15 - many uh libraries are there you know
05:18 - which are going to allow you to work in
05:21 - these uh Fields researchers favorite
05:24 - language is python right and many big
05:28 - tech companies are using this language
05:30 - like Google Netflix Amazon for
05:32 - automation for data science for you know
05:34 - handling large set of data for
05:37 - artificial intelligence and a lot of
05:40 - documentation and many tutorials are
05:41 - available many courses are available so
05:43 - you can easily learn this language and
05:46 - it can be used in backend development
05:48 - also through Jango flas through these
05:51 - Frameworks now the second one is
05:54 - Javascript
05:55 - 98% web is using
05:58 - JavaScript nowadays right so it is
06:01 - everywhere and it is skill scaling it's
06:04 - like it has dominated the web
06:06 - development field JavaScript language so
06:09 - if you are a beginner and if you are
06:11 - interested in web development like
06:12 - designing websites even for front end
06:15 - development full stack development even
06:16 - back end development go for JavaScript
06:19 - right this should be your first language
06:21 - to pick up right and it it is having you
06:23 - know a great scope in future right
06:26 - beginner friendly language not so tough
06:28 - to learn right
06:30 - can be used both in front endend and
06:32 - back end right you know reactjs so much
06:36 - popular right so these are angular
06:39 - reactjs the these are based on
06:41 - JavaScript right through nodejs you can
06:43 - use this JavaScript for backend
06:45 - development and many big tech companies
06:47 - like even Facebook Google are using this
06:49 - language so if you are a beginner and if
06:52 - you are interested in web development
06:54 - even front end development back end
06:56 - development or full development go for
06:57 - JavaScript and if you are
07:00 - you are interested in those like data
07:01 - science machine learning ai go for
07:03 - python right both are easy to learn
07:06 - beginner friendly but it depends in
07:08 - which field you are interested according
07:09 - to that you have to pick your choice
07:11 - both are having great scoping future
07:13 - right third one is Java Java is yeah
07:17 - it's very old but it is still po very
07:20 - popular language still Enterprise
07:23 - favorite language still Java is a go-to
07:25 - language for companies to pick up like
07:27 - while you know uh developing a
07:30 - Enterprise apps Enterprise app means
07:32 - like these are like you can say consider
07:34 - these as normal apps but these are
07:36 - specifically built for that this that
07:38 - particular business that particular
07:41 - Enterprise so for that Java is goto
07:44 - language the most popular language to
07:46 - learn still there are many job openings
07:49 - still you know and for experienced Java
07:53 - developers the
07:54 - salary uh is you know here the salary
07:58 - package is much more and many openings
08:01 - are there and still in future is in
08:03 - future also this is having a great scope
08:07 - right and one drawback of this is it is
08:10 - little bit tough yeah it is tough
08:12 - compared to Python and JavaScript but
08:14 - the plus point is what if you go for
08:16 - Java right and after that if you learn
08:19 - any other programming language then it
08:21 - would be easy for you guys to pick up
08:22 - that other programming language right so
08:25 - that is a plus point but yeah for
08:27 - beginner it is a little bit tough to
08:29 - learn Java but definitely if you are
08:33 - interested you can pick this language as
08:35 - your first programming language right
08:38 - next I would recommend go for go or go L
08:41 - it is emerging language it is gaining
08:44 - popularity and definitely it is having a
08:46 - great scope in future go language it is
08:49 - designed by Google and definitely better
08:51 - than C and C++ right and it is going to
08:53 - you know focus more on backend
08:56 - development right so it is being
08:58 - designed for backend development backend
09:00 - services to provide backend services for
09:02 - cloud computing like cloud services
09:04 - infrastructure Services these kind of
09:06 - things yeah it is having limited library
09:09 - and limited Community but still it is
09:12 - emerging right and it is having a great
09:14 - scope and it is techically type language
09:17 - and it is highly performance language
09:20 - right simple and readable sentex but
09:23 - there are if you want to go in deep then
09:25 - definitely you have to learn those high
09:27 - level uh you know concept like
09:29 - concurrency threading these are little
09:32 - bit tough right but so you can choose
09:36 - this as your second language right not
09:38 - first language if you are a beginner
09:40 - first go for either python or JavaScript
09:42 - right these are easy to learn then go
09:43 - for as a second language you can uh
09:45 - choose goang right next for mobile lab
09:50 - development either cin or Swift right
09:55 - cotan is gaining popularity see uh ping
09:59 - is used for Android development right
10:02 - and Swift is used for IOS app
10:05 - development right so it depends in which
10:08 - field you are interested for in iOS or C
10:12 - sorry in iOS or Android right uh before
10:16 - Java was Java language was used for uh
10:20 - app development for Android development
10:22 - but later in 201 2017 Google announced
10:25 - the scotlink as their official language
10:27 - for Android development right and then
10:32 - it is gaining popularity and it will it
10:35 - is having a great scope in future also
10:37 - and if you want to be an iOS Developer
10:39 - you want to develop iOS apps for like
10:41 - maybe for Apple watch or Mac or iOS
10:45 - phone Apple phone then go for Swift it
10:48 - is also not so much difficult and iOS
10:51 - developers are also having a good salary
10:54 - package next rust it is like new C
11:00 - it is gaining popularity uh basically
11:03 - used in system programming for Designing
11:05 - operating system C was used first but
11:08 - the big tech companies and those are you
11:10 - know switching to rust for uh system
11:13 - programming right for system designing
11:15 - for operating system so uh it is also a
11:19 - language of future rust you can learn
11:21 - this this also but you choose this
11:23 - language as your maybe second or maybe
11:26 - third programming language right because
11:29 - yeah it is difficult to learn a little
11:31 - bit but it is secure and reliable and it
11:34 - has gained so much popularity in recent
11:37 - years so you definitely you can go for
11:38 - rust next last but not the least is SQL
11:42 - structured query language it is the
11:43 - topmost database used simple query you
11:47 - can write but yeah you can write down
11:49 - more advanced and complex query as well
11:52 - but definitely you you should go for SQL
11:55 - also right if you want to deal with
11:57 - database because it is the top most so
11:59 - say the one of the
12:01 - most popular database used so that's it
12:05 - from my side if you think that there
12:06 - should be another language in this list
12:08 - then you can just write down in that
12:10 - comment section right so now I'll see
12:13 - you in the next then bye-bye take care
