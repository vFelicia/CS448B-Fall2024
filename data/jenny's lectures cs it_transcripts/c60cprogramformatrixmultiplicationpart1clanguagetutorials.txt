00:00 - so in the series of learning programming
00:01 - in c we are discussing some programs on
00:03 - matrix
00:04 - we have discussed what in the previous
00:05 - video ah addition of two metrics so in
00:08 - this video we will discuss
00:09 - multiplication of two matrix and we will
00:10 - print that multiplication
00:12 - right so see first of all we will just
00:15 - you know try to understand the logic
00:17 - behind multiplication
00:18 - the theory behind this some rules you
00:21 - have to take care while you are
00:22 - going for multiplication of two metrics
00:24 - and then we will see the logic
00:26 - we will write on that program and then
00:27 - we'll see practically on
00:29 - my laptop but before that just want to
00:31 - tell you one thing whether you are
00:32 - preparing or will be preparing for
00:34 - software development roles at top
00:36 - product companies
00:37 - an academy subscription can be perfect
00:40 - companion and guide for you
00:42 - why do i say that because you will get
00:45 - best in class educators from the
00:47 - companies like
00:48 - amazon google and other such top
00:50 - companies where you guys want to work
00:54 - these educators will take live and
00:56 - interactive classes
00:57 - where all your concepts will be cleared
01:00 - and your doubts will be solved in real
01:03 - time
01:04 - so you can leave every class with a good
01:06 - outcome
01:08 - the course and curriculum has been
01:09 - designed by the experienced people from
01:12 - the industry
01:13 - who have been working in the companies
01:15 - like
01:16 - linkedin google amazon and other such
01:18 - top companies
01:19 - and have cleared many interviews that
01:22 - you want to in future in addition to all
01:25 - these
01:26 - you get on demand doubt support
01:29 - on discord where you can ask your doubts
01:32 - if you missed asking them in
01:34 - live class here you will get courses on
01:36 - everything
01:37 - including system design full stack
01:41 - back and end data structure and
01:43 - algorithm
01:44 - and in case if you have missed any live
01:46 - class because of your busy schedule it's
01:48 - okay
01:48 - you have option to watch recording of
01:51 - the classes
01:53 - so while you have option to choose to
01:55 - choose a three six or twelve month
01:57 - subscription i guess a 12 month
01:59 - subscription will be
02:00 - you know make more sense because it just
02:03 - cost 90 rupees per day and you
02:06 - you can use my code jkl10 to get 10
02:09 - extra discount on your paid subscription
02:11 - see it's not like that just read the no
02:14 - statement
02:15 - what program you have to do and start
02:17 - writing a program first of all
02:18 - understand the program the logic behind
02:20 - that
02:21 - no try to write down the program with
02:23 - your hand with a pen or pen or paper
02:25 - rather than just directly jump to your
02:27 - laptop right so first of all we will see
02:30 - that thing only
02:30 - so two metrics
02:36 - these are two metrics we are going to
02:38 - multiply these metrics and
02:41 - the resultant matrix try to understand
02:45 - the dimension of this resultant matrix
02:48 - what would be the dimension it would be
02:52 - three into three first of all let me
02:54 - clear uh
02:55 - you know let me just do the
02:57 - multiplication how that is to be done
02:59 - after that we will discuss one by one
03:01 - all the rules and the size of this
03:04 - matrix why you are getting that size and
03:06 - everything will discuss the conditions
03:07 - and all
03:09 - we are taking both both matrix 3 into 3
03:11 - how multiplication will be done
03:14 - the index would be 0 1 2 0 1 2
03:22 - these are rows and these are columns so
03:25 - first row first of all we will
03:29 - find out value which would be stored
03:31 - here at the resultant matrix
03:33 - right so first row
03:37 - we will take first row of the first
03:39 - matrix
03:40 - and this first column
03:44 - of second matrix right
03:47 - means 0th row of first matrix and
03:51 - 0th column of second matrix and we are
03:53 - going to multiply
03:54 - 1 into 1 1 into 1 plus
03:59 - then second element 5 second element of
04:02 - this column
04:03 - 5 into 0 plus
04:06 - 6 into 1 so here the value will get
04:10 - would be 7 so that would be stored here
04:14 - 7
04:15 - now for this one
04:19 - how you will get same 0th row
04:23 - but the column would be this one
04:26 - second column or you can say that column
04:29 - 1
04:30 - i am representing column with index so
04:33 - how you will get
04:35 - 2 into 1
04:38 - 2 plus 5 into 1
04:41 - 5 plus 6 into 0 0
04:44 - so here also you will get 7
04:48 - now for this element same
04:51 - this row and now the column would be
04:54 - this one column of second matrix would
04:57 - be
04:57 - this one so 0th row and second column
05:01 - 3 plus 1 3 plus 5
05:05 - plus 5 25 plus 6
05:08 - into 2. 12 and here it would be
05:12 - 40 right
05:16 - now for this one see the size of this
05:20 - would be
05:20 - 3 into 3 y 3 into 3
05:26 - the size of resultant matrix would be
05:29 - we'll take rows of first matrix
05:33 - rows are 3 into
05:37 - columns of second matrix columns are 3
05:42 - that will be size of the resultant
05:43 - matrix
05:45 - right so here i guess you are clear why
05:48 - size is 3 into 3 right so now
05:52 - 0 1 2 here rows index would be 0 1 2
05:54 - column index 0 1 2
05:57 - now what is going to be stored here
06:00 - index for this is what
06:02 - 1 and 0 1
06:05 - and one at one throw and zeroth column
06:08 - so to get a value for this we will take
06:11 - first this this row
06:16 - i mean row one of first matrix
06:19 - and this 0th column of second matrix
06:24 - means 2 into 1 2 plus 2 into 0
06:28 - 0 plus 5 into 1 5
06:31 - and here it would be 7. right
06:35 - for this one index for this is what
06:38 - 1 and 1 right so 1 and 1
06:43 - so you can relate it something like this
06:46 - 1 means row one of first matrix
06:49 - and another one is what
06:52 - column one of second matrix we are going
06:54 - to multiply this and we are going to add
06:56 - two into two four plus two into one two
06:59 - plus five into zero 0 it would be
07:03 - 6. now this is what index for this is
07:06 - what
07:06 - 1 and 2 1 and 2 it means
07:10 - row 1 first matrix and column would be
07:13 - now
07:14 - second second of this matrix so 2
07:17 - into 3 6 plus
07:21 - 5 into 2 10 plus 5 into 2
07:24 - 10 so that would be 26
07:28 - now we have to find out value for this
07:30 - now so index for this is what
07:32 - 2 and 0 so now
07:35 - for the first we will take row second
07:39 - of first matrix and we'll multiply this
07:42 - row with
07:42 - zeroth column of c 0 is a zeroth column
07:45 - of second matrix
07:46 - so here you will get 1 into 1
07:50 - so these are the values you are getting
07:52 - right
07:53 - now the rule is what if you want to
07:55 - multiply 2 metrics
07:57 - then must have condition is what
08:01 - columns of first matrix
08:04 - must be equal to rows of
08:07 - second matrix here columns of
08:11 - first matrix are what columns are
08:14 - 3 and rows
08:17 - in second matrix are what 3 both are
08:21 - equal
08:21 - so you can multiply this if
08:24 - matrix is something like this 2 into 3
08:29 - here we are having 2 rows we are not
08:31 - having this row
08:32 - and 3 columns and this is of 3 into 3.
08:36 - now we cannot multiply directly you have
08:38 - to print you cannot multiply these
08:39 - metrics
08:41 - see columns why you cannot multiply if
08:44 - i am going to remove this
08:47 - now this is a matrix now why you cannot
08:49 - multiply
08:50 - see the reason this this matrix would be
08:54 - of
08:56 - size dimension would be you will take
09:00 - rows of first matrix and columns of
09:03 - second matrix
09:04 - so 3 into 3 so that should be 3 into 3
09:06 - size
09:08 - right now 3 to 3 means this one we have
09:10 - to find out 9 values
09:12 - so for this we will multiply for this
09:15 - subscript 4 this is 0 0 so we'll
09:16 - multiply this row
09:18 - 0 through this column right
09:22 - one with this one five with zero but six
09:24 - with one
09:26 - here we have nothing it's not like that
09:27 - you can directly write one into one plus
09:29 - five into zero plus
09:30 - only six no you must have something to
09:33 - multiply with the six but here we don't
09:35 - have anything because
09:36 - this is having only two rows that is why
09:39 - it's not possible to multiply these
09:41 - metrics so for multiplication
09:43 - columns of first matrix must be equal to
09:45 - rows of second matrix
09:47 - right because of this logic because of
09:49 - this
09:50 - means how we are getting the uh you know
09:53 - the elements of resultant matrix
09:55 - right because we are going to multiply
09:57 - the columns here what
09:58 - this this these are columns and we are
10:01 - going to multiply this with
10:03 - this one so these are rows
10:06 - of second matrix that is why one two
10:09 - three columns so the row should be
10:11 - three so that you can get multiplication
10:14 - exit
10:15 - you have something to multiply with the
10:16 - six i hope you got the condition
10:18 - now right so now one question for you is
10:23 - so before asking questions let me just
10:25 - um you know somewhere
10:27 - in generalized form it is written what
10:29 - if matrix
10:30 - one is a having m rows n column second
10:35 - matrix is b
10:35 - having p and q b rows and
10:39 - q columns and if you want to multiply
10:41 - these metrics
10:42 - then only the condition is if this
10:46 - number of columns of this a
10:50 - equal to equal to number of rows of
10:54 - second matrix that is p
10:57 - then only you can multiply right
11:00 - otherwise we cannot multiply so we have
11:03 - to put in a while we write a program we
11:04 - will also put this condition
11:06 - if this condition is true then only will
11:09 - multiply if this condition is not true
11:11 - then you directly have to print sorry we
11:12 - cannot multiply these matrix
11:14 - right and the size of resultant matrix
11:18 - would be
11:18 - if this is the case then size of
11:20 - resultant matrix would be
11:21 - m into q
11:25 - rows of first matrix columns of second
11:28 - matrix
11:29 - so now the question is this
11:33 - i want to multiply this can you multiply
11:35 - this matrix and if we multiply these two
11:37 - matrix then what would be the
11:39 - size of c is suppose resultant matrix
11:42 - what would be the size here that you
11:44 - have to tell me in common box
11:46 - and second question is if i am having a
11:47 - matrix something like this
11:49 - a is 2 into 3 and b is 3 into 2 can we
11:51 - multiply this and if we can multiply
11:53 - then
11:54 - find the size of the resultant matrix so
11:56 - this is part one of metric
11:58 - matrix multiplication into the next part
12:00 - we will discuss we will draw it in the
12:01 - program here we will discuss the logic
12:03 - here and
12:03 - practically i will show you the output
12:06 - of that matrix multiplication program on
12:08 - my laptop
12:08 - right if because if i i'll do in the you
12:11 - know same
12:12 - lecture then this video will be very
12:14 - lengthy so i'll see you in the next
12:15 - video till then bye bye
12:19 - take
