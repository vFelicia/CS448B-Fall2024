00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language previously
00:05 - in previous video we have seen uh basics
00:07 - of dictionaries like it was like
00:09 - introduction to dictionaries what is a
00:10 - dictionary why we use dictionary how
00:12 - dictionary is different from list apple
00:14 - and set some built-in function with the
00:16 - help of program we have seen and after
00:17 - that we have done one coding exercise as
00:19 - well right grading system
00:22 - right now One More Concept is what
00:25 - nested dictionaries
00:27 - or nested lists and dictionaries you can
00:30 - say we can list we can Nest our list
00:33 - into a dictionary and as well as we can
00:34 - Nest a dictionary into our dictionary
00:36 - okay what is the meaning of this thing
00:38 - I'll discuss this thing in detail but
00:42 - little bit about nesting of dictionaries
00:44 - and list we have discussed in that video
00:46 - also when we are discussing
00:48 - uh introduction to dictionaries like
00:50 - what does dictionary in python in the
00:52 - previous video
00:54 - now in this video we'll see in detailing
00:55 - what is a nested dictionary how to
00:58 - access elements of an insta Dictionary
01:00 - what is the syntax how to write down a
01:01 - Next Fitness to dictionary now what is
01:04 - the meaning or you can say how this
01:05 - nested nesting of dictionaries are
01:08 - useful the application of this thing
01:11 - right some built-in function that we how
01:14 - we can use those built-in function on
01:16 - nested dictionaries right this thing
01:19 - we'll be discussing in this video with
01:21 - the help of program
01:23 - okay now see
01:25 - what is the meaning of this nested
01:27 - dictionaries nested means nested
01:29 - dictionary means dictionary within a
01:32 - dictionary
01:34 - that is simple
01:35 - nested dictionary right
01:38 - a dictionary can contain another
01:40 - dictionary that can contain other
01:42 - another dictionary that can contain
01:44 - another dictionary right to it
01:47 - to an arbitrary depth we can say so
01:51 - multiple level of nesting is also
01:53 - possible
01:55 - right
01:56 - I hope you are getting simple nesting is
01:58 - what a dictionary within a dictionary
02:01 - that is nested dictionary that's it
02:05 - what is the syntax see
02:09 - simple dictionary how you will write
02:11 - like
02:12 - key and value suppose key one value one
02:17 - key two
02:18 - value two
02:22 - this is a simple dictionary but if the
02:27 - keys rather than simply these values are
02:29 - maybe like integer or numbers or
02:31 - anything which can be modified right
02:34 - if we write rather than value here I am
02:36 - writing another dictionary
02:41 - here also I'm writing like maybe it was
02:43 - one more dictionary
02:47 - so rather than simple values in keys I
02:49 - am writing another dictionary so this is
02:52 - what this is a dictionary suppose the
02:55 - name is
02:56 - so data this is a dictionary and within
02:58 - this we have two more dictionaries
03:01 - so this data we can say it is a nested
03:05 - dictionary
03:06 - because it is containing more dictionary
03:08 - and rather than this suppose we have E3
03:11 - and here I can have
03:12 - list
03:17 - nesting of a list within a dictionary is
03:20 - also possible
03:21 - as we know nesting of a list within a
03:23 - list is also possible right so this is
03:26 - what you can say
03:28 - Panda of nested kind of thing nested
03:32 - dictionaries and nested list now how to
03:35 - Nest a dictionary within a dictionary
03:37 - how to Nest a list within a dictionary
03:40 - how to apply those built-in functions on
03:43 - this nested dictionary how to access the
03:46 - data of this nested dictionary right
03:48 - this thing will be discussing with the
03:50 - help of a program practically I'll show
03:51 - you right and say I've told you this
03:53 - nesting can be of
03:54 - multiple levels like within this
03:57 - dictionary suppose this
04:00 - in this I am having
04:02 - like suppose within this also I have a
04:04 - key one and that key is also a
04:07 - dictionary
04:12 - E2
04:14 - value 2
04:16 - comma
04:17 - see this is the dictionary within this I
04:19 - am having this dictionary and within
04:22 - this dictionary I am having one more
04:23 - dictionary so this can be your two up to
04:26 - multiple levels within this dictionary
04:28 - also we can have a one more dictionary
04:30 - I hope you are getting this is what you
04:32 - can say level of nesting this can be up
04:35 - to multiple levels right okay now let's
04:37 - see this thing with the help of program
04:39 - okay so let's create a new file here
04:43 - and what we are discussing
04:45 - nested dictionary so nested dictionaries
04:48 - dot p y
04:50 - right
04:51 - simple example we will take first of all
04:54 - what we will do
04:56 - dictionary same we will Nest a
04:58 - dictionary within our dictionary
05:01 - right
05:02 - let's take we have a dictionary
05:05 - we are having a student data
05:09 - the name is student data and
05:14 - this is the dictionary so here
05:17 - either like in the previous case we have
05:19 - seen
05:20 - we just write down here the key like
05:22 - name and value is like suppose Ram
05:27 - okay then maybe age then roll number and
05:31 - course like this key and value pair but
05:33 - rather than k n value pair
05:35 - at this point of time we are having
05:37 - these values not as a string but these
05:40 - values should be dictionary
05:43 - right
05:44 - okay so now key I am taking suppose name
05:47 - of a student
05:49 - roll number or anything you can take or
05:52 - one two three also you can take any
05:53 - integer it's up to you
05:56 - so RAM and
05:58 - the value I am taking in the form of
06:01 - dictionary like one student the
06:03 - information of that student now name of
06:06 - the student is I am taking as a key and
06:08 - here I am taking
06:13 - roll number
06:15 - first key and then roll number is
06:17 - suppose 10. then comma then I'm taking
06:21 - like age
06:25 - and age is suppose uh 20.
06:30 - and then I'm taking suppose
06:32 - opted is suppose python right so see
06:36 - this is another dictionary same here
06:39 - comma then for second student suppose I
06:42 - am having one student Mohan
06:46 - I am
06:48 - having the same information
06:54 - is 20 then age of Mohan is like maybe 22
06:59 - and courses
07:02 - let's suppose C plus plus or let's
07:05 - suppose Java
07:07 - like this so this is what nested
07:10 - dictionary
07:12 - we are nesting a dictionary within our
07:14 - dictionary
07:15 - right okay now how to access this thing
07:18 - if you want to print this thing
07:21 - let's simply print print
07:24 - student data let's run this
07:27 - see
07:29 - RAM and this is one more dictionary then
07:33 - Mohan second key and this is value is in
07:36 - the form of dictionary right
07:39 - now individually if you want to access
07:41 - like
07:43 - student data and for Mohan only I want
07:45 - to access
07:47 - so just provide the key name Mohan in
07:50 - bracket and
07:51 - C
07:53 - this will get if
07:55 - you want to access only mohan's age or
07:58 - mohan's roll number so first pass like
08:01 - student data
08:04 - let's print print
08:07 - then the name of the dictionary student
08:09 - data then first subscript pass
08:13 - name of the key Mohan and in second
08:15 - subscript Mohan then roll number
08:19 - so
08:21 - roll number
08:23 - this I want to print let's run this see
08:26 - first a student data Mohan the record of
08:29 - one will be printed and next only the
08:31 - age of Mohan
08:32 - sorry roll number of movement roll
08:34 - number of 1 is 20 so 20 would be printed
08:36 - so this is how you can access right if
08:38 - you want to add like
08:40 - I want to add roll number sorry phone
08:42 - number of Mohan
08:44 - how you will add
08:47 - we have have to add we have discussed
08:49 - this thing
08:50 - just name of the dictionary student and
08:53 - pass
08:55 - the key Mohan right now in Mohan within
09:00 - Mohan this is one more dictionary so in
09:02 - this dictionary I want to add
09:04 - phone number so one more subscript and
09:08 - there what you want to add
09:12 - phone number
09:14 - just write down this thing and equal to
09:16 - what phone number you want to add nine
09:18 - eight seven six like something like this
09:21 - and now let's print
09:25 - student data and just I'm printing
09:28 - student data data of Mohan
09:32 - okay
09:34 - let's comment comment out first this
09:36 - line
09:39 - and
09:40 - this also
09:43 - now we are modifying nested dictionary
09:46 - so let's run this C
09:50 - here we have added phone number as well
09:53 - so if you want to print one data so it
09:55 - will show course age roll number and
09:58 - then phone number also this is how you
10:00 - can add if you want to add something if
10:02 - you want to delete from nested
10:03 - dictionary that is also possible suppose
10:06 - I want to delete
10:07 - Mohan or phone number Mohan
10:11 - is not interested to you know provide
10:13 - his phone number so let's delete the
10:15 - phone number of Mohan particular
10:17 - so student data then
10:22 - directly you cannot write down phone
10:24 - number here suppose I am writing here
10:30 - if you want to delete phone number you
10:31 - say maybe you are thinking Del name of
10:33 - the dictionary and phone number just
10:35 - write down this thing
10:37 - but let's run this
10:39 - see it will give error key error phone
10:42 - number
10:43 - because here you are providing the keys
10:45 - of student data right and in student
10:48 - data this dictionary we are having only
10:50 - two piece RAM and Mohan
10:52 - these are keys of student data
10:55 - dictionary RAM and Mohan and this roll
10:57 - number age course these are keys of
11:01 - this dictionaries dictionary name is Ram
11:03 - roll number age course these are keys of
11:06 - this dictionary Mohan right so student
11:08 - data dictionary is not having any key
11:10 - phone number
11:12 - right
11:13 - this Mohan this dictionary is having
11:15 - phone number because we have added this
11:18 - thing for number right so if you want to
11:20 - delete first provide
11:22 - the name of dictionary Mohan
11:25 - this thing
11:27 - then second subscript phone number
11:30 - right and then if you will print
11:36 - uh sorry
11:42 - the student data of
11:46 - Mohan
11:48 - let's run this
11:51 - in first we are having phone number and
11:54 - after deleting phone numbers
11:56 - agent course this is how you can delete
11:59 - and
12:00 - with pop also we can delete but if you
12:02 - want to return
12:04 - return the value whatever value have
12:06 - deleted if you want to return that value
12:08 - if you want to print that value then use
12:10 - pop function if you don't want to return
12:13 - if you don't want to print whatever you
12:14 - have deleted just use Dell function I
12:16 - hope you got the difference between Del
12:18 - and delete so if you see this Del will
12:20 - not return anything but if you want to
12:23 - return if you want to print whatever
12:25 - value you have deleted then use pop
12:28 - function
12:28 - so pop function how we will use rather
12:30 - than Dell suppose I'm using pop
12:32 - functions or student data Mohan
12:35 - from this dictionary I want to delete
12:36 - phone number so first student data
12:38 - provide the name of the correct
12:40 - dictionary Mohan then Dot
12:43 - pop
12:44 - and within this pop you have to
12:48 - provide
12:49 - what key you want to delete I you want
12:52 - to delete phone number so let's provide
12:54 - this phone number now you can if you
12:57 - print
13:00 - this thing so Pope will return the value
13:02 - whatever value it is going to delete it
13:04 - will return that value and after that
13:06 - we'll print data of Mohan
13:08 - so see first without deleting this print
13:12 - statement then we have executed pop
13:15 - function phone number so it is going to
13:17 - return this phone number pop function is
13:20 - going to delete now after deleting just
13:22 - print
13:23 - Mohan data and there is no phone number
13:26 - right so this is how you can remove if
13:28 - you want to delete something from here
13:31 - right
13:32 - if you want to add access remove delete
13:34 - I hope you got the basic idea of nested
13:36 - dictionaries right now
13:39 - if you want to Nest a list within a
13:42 - dictionary
13:43 - how we are going to Nest that thing see
13:49 - let's just comment out this code and now
13:52 - we are nesting a list within a
13:55 - dictionary right
13:57 - suppose
13:58 - okay we are planning a trip to Gujarat
14:00 - so suppose
14:03 - take this example
14:04 - travel
14:06 - data this dictionary I am taking and
14:08 - within this dictionary now I am going to
14:10 - Nest a list so I'm going to Nest like
14:15 - in Gujarat in the state
14:18 - which cities or which places we are
14:20 - going to visit right so the key is state
14:24 - name
14:26 - and there
14:28 - here a list of places we are going to
14:31 - visit
14:32 - like the list of places we are going to
14:35 - visit
14:36 - right and let's take
14:39 - another state
14:42 - in this state also if we'll go we are
14:44 - going to visit maybe like
14:48 - which like this right so this is what a
14:52 - list this is also a list so we are here
14:55 - this is the example of nesting our list
14:57 - within a dictionary so let's print this
15:04 - if you print this
15:06 - travel data simple travel data let's run
15:09 - this
15:14 - yeah my mistake here definitely
15:18 - first item then comma then second item
15:20 - this is a syntax error let's run this
15:23 - now see Gujarat and list of places
15:25 - Rajasthan and let's talk places it is
15:28 - going to show you right so like this in
15:31 - the in values we can write down list and
15:33 - dictionaries as well rather than just
15:35 - numbers and strings okay now within this
15:39 - see within this list also we can have
15:42 - one more list that is also possible and
15:44 - within this list we can have one more
15:46 - dictionary also so this is a level of
15:48 - nesting you can try this out now this
15:51 - example of nesting of a list within a
15:53 - dictionary but we can also nest
15:56 - a dictionary in a list
16:01 - or if suppose if you want to access like
16:03 - okay
16:04 - now if you want to access Rajasthan this
16:06 - this values of Rajasthan the places that
16:09 - we are going to visit when we go to
16:10 - Rajasthan is then
16:12 - here in bracket just pass the value
16:15 - I mean the key value of Rajasthan so
16:17 - let's print this it will only print
16:19 - Jaipur and udaipur we are going to Nest
16:21 - we are going to nest what
16:24 - uh we are going to Nest dictionary
16:26 - within list
16:29 - okay so same example we will take lights
16:32 - let's just remove the comment of this
16:35 - thing
16:36 - so here we are having dictionary within
16:38 - dictionary but I am going to have
16:40 - dictionary within a list so this should
16:42 - be a list
16:43 - so just remove the curly bracket and
16:47 - square bracket so this student data is
16:49 - now a list and this should be now
16:52 - dictionary so now this will give error
16:54 - because
16:55 - the syntax this is what key and value
16:57 - pair and the syntax is of dictionary but
16:59 - the student data is in our list and a
17:02 - list syntax is what simply
17:04 - in bracket like one two three or if you
17:08 - want to add string then Jenny if you
17:11 - want to add one more list then also
17:12 - possible three comma 4 like this
17:15 - so this is the syntax of list
17:17 - no key and value pair we can add
17:19 - list within a list is also possible but
17:22 - this is not as much useful useful as we
17:25 - have
17:27 - list within a dictionary or dictionary
17:29 - within a list or dictionary within a
17:31 - dictionary that is more useful so nested
17:34 - dictionary is basically it's a great way
17:36 - to store and represent structured
17:39 - information
17:40 - right because we are placing the data we
17:44 - are you know putting the data in the
17:46 - form of key and value pair
17:48 - so more structured in more structured
17:49 - where we can put data in a dictionary
17:51 - like we have in a real world data
17:54 - arrangement in the same form we can put
17:56 - so that is more useful
17:58 - okay now
18:00 - let's remove this thing and put the
18:02 - correct syntax so rather than this key
18:05 - we will add in this dictionary
18:08 - one more e n value pair
18:11 - name
18:12 - and name is RAM
18:16 - comma
18:17 - okay
18:18 - and remove this one
18:22 - now move on remove this key and as a key
18:25 - value pair just add this thing
18:28 - name
18:29 - and
18:31 - Mohan
18:34 - roll number let's say this now that's
18:37 - fine we are having two dictionaries
18:39 - within a list
18:41 - okay
18:43 - now if you want to access
18:47 - let's delete just this thing
18:52 - now you know we can access the list
18:55 - values with the help of index we don't
18:58 - have to provide any key because the list
19:00 - is not having any key so print
19:03 - student data if you simply print this
19:05 - thing student data let's run those
19:08 - so it will give a list of two
19:10 - dictionaries
19:11 - okay now student data at
19:14 - zeroth index what is that zeroth index
19:18 - that I want to print so at zeroth index
19:20 - we are having
19:21 - information of ram at one index we are
19:25 - having
19:25 - information of Mohan so that it will
19:28 - print if you want to if you provide
19:30 - index 2 it will give error index out of
19:32 - range because there is no to a second
19:34 - index only two entries we are having so
19:36 - zero and one index
19:39 - like this is also possible dictionaries
19:41 - within list right and for better
19:45 - understanding you a simple convention is
19:47 - you can write down how
19:49 - a list then dictionary and
19:55 - within this
20:01 - just add these things something like
20:03 - this so this is one dictionary
20:06 - then comma then
20:08 - this is
20:10 - second one
20:12 - so this I think would be more readable
20:15 - right this is simple convention
20:19 - just to make the data more readable so
20:21 - this is a list student data in which you
20:23 - are having first dictionary this one
20:25 - second dictionary this one
20:27 - okay now I hope you got what are nested
20:31 - dictionaries how to Nest a list within a
20:33 - dictionary how to Nest a dictionary
20:35 - within a list and all and multiple level
20:38 - listing is a multiple level nesting is
20:40 - also possible suppose this is a list
20:42 - within this we have a dictionary and
20:44 - within this dictionary
20:46 - I want to
20:48 - add a phone number and phone number
20:52 - phone number in the form of list like
20:54 - two phone number Mohan is having two
20:56 - phone numbers so something like this one
20:58 - is this comma second is this
21:03 - sorry here we have come
21:05 - so this is what again a list within a
21:08 - dictionary
21:09 - so multiple level of nesting so if you
21:12 - want to print phone number of Mohan so
21:14 - simply student data index 2 and there
21:18 - just provide
21:23 - the name the key phone number because
21:25 - this is
21:26 - dictionary so phone number is the key
21:29 - and let's print this
21:32 - okay list out of index because
21:34 - it's not 2 indexes one let's run this
21:38 - C Mohan phone number at index one we
21:42 - have this dictionary in this data
21:46 - and within this dictionary I want to
21:47 - access the phone number the value of
21:49 - this key phone number so it will give
21:51 - this thing the list of list of phone
21:53 - numbers
21:54 - so I hope this is not almost confusing
21:56 - if it is okay just take a break
22:00 - and then try this out with different
22:02 - different examples right because based
22:04 - on this only we will be discussing one
22:07 - coding exercise in next video based on
22:09 - this we'll take this example only the
22:12 - student data so I hope you heard what is
22:15 - nested dictionaries and how to Nest a
22:17 - list within a dictionaries and all right
22:19 - now in the next video we'll see one
22:22 - coding exercise
22:23 - based on this video only
22:25 - based on this nested process nested
22:28 - Funda will see one more exercise in the
22:30 - next video now we'll see in the next
22:31 - video bye take care
