00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:04 - Python programming language we are
00:05 - discussing functions in Python we have
00:07 - discussed like functions normal function
00:09 - the definition I mean the introduction
00:11 - of functions and functions with
00:13 - arguments then types of arguments then
00:14 - we have different discussed like arcs
00:17 - and quarks right based on that we'll be
00:20 - doing one simple exercise coding
00:22 - exercise
00:22 - right now
00:24 - you are you know going to uh paint a
00:27 - wall right and you have to calculate the
00:30 - number of cans needed the number of cans
00:33 - of paint needed to paint that complete
00:35 - wall
00:36 - right so what you need the input height
00:39 - and width of that wall right then you
00:43 - will calculate maybe the area as well as
00:45 - you need
00:46 - the coverage
00:48 - right means suppose let's assume one can
00:52 - of paint can
00:54 - uh paint seven square meter of area
01:00 - seven square meter of area of that wall
01:03 - one can
01:07 - and this is the coverage
01:09 - now you have to define a function that
01:13 - will accept three arguments like height
01:14 - weight of the whole height of the wall
01:16 - and the coverage and based on that you
01:19 - have to calculate how many cans would be
01:22 - needed the output should be how many
01:23 - cans needed to paint that complete wall
01:27 - right
01:28 - now what you have to do see now the
01:31 - formula is
01:32 - a number of cans needed is what area
01:35 - like height
01:36 - into width divided by this coverage
01:42 - coverage means seven square meter right
01:45 - so this this
01:47 - number of cans like the number of cans
01:51 - the complete name you can write
01:53 - this thing this formula you have to
01:54 - apply it area means height into width
01:57 - then divided by the coverage seven
01:58 - square meter
02:00 - but the problem here is what suppose uh
02:02 - here you will get 1.7
02:07 - something like this
02:08 - right after decimal it will be having
02:11 - few numbers right but obviously we
02:14 - cannot buy 1.7 can like point seven one
02:18 - we can buy or point seven we cannot buy
02:20 - either we will buy one or two cans
02:23 - so now you have to round this number up
02:27 - means 1.7 means it should give you
02:30 - answer two
02:31 - if the answer is one point 4 then also
02:36 - obviously we will not buy one because
02:38 - point four you need so you will not if
02:41 - you buy one can you will not able to
02:43 - paint the complete wall so you can buy
02:44 - two because if there is some extra paint
02:47 - it's okay we'll uh keep that paint okay
02:50 - extra is fine so in this case also it
02:53 - should give answer two so you have to
02:55 - round up the number round up the number
02:58 - 1.4 also two not one 1.7 also
03:03 - a two if you use the round function then
03:06 - it will give two but it will give one so
03:08 - you cannot use round function so one
03:10 - hint is you can use
03:12 - ceiling function see
03:16 - you can just read out something about C
03:18 - what is this and how to use this is your
03:21 - you can say assignment so I'm not going
03:24 - to tell you how to use this function I'm
03:26 - just giving you a hint use seal function
03:29 - to get this kind of offer to round up a
03:32 - number right so just do some Googling
03:34 - and find it out
03:36 - so I hope you got what is the problem
03:37 - and how to find out the formula I have
03:40 - told you everything what should be the
03:42 - input what should be the output right so
03:44 - now pause the video and give it a try
03:46 - okay so I hope you have done this you
03:49 - have tried this out now let's create a
03:52 - new file and like
03:54 - paint area
03:56 - calculation dot py or simply painted
04:00 - Redwood p y right now what you need
04:02 - height and width of the wall suppose I'm
04:05 - taking a variable H and
04:08 - obviously input function using input we
04:11 - will ask height from the user so this
04:14 - would be string by default that is why
04:17 - here only I typecasting it I am
04:20 - converting this into integer
04:23 - see int right so same for width so let's
04:28 - just copy paste this and take a variable
04:31 - MW then end input enter the not height
04:34 - this time it should be
04:37 - width of wall in meters two thing we
04:40 - need and we know that like coverage is
04:44 - equal to 7 Square per meter so that is
04:48 - 7.
04:49 - so let us call the function suppose
04:51 - suppose we haven't defined the function
04:53 - yet so we are calling the function or
04:56 - let us Define the function first
04:58 - right okay we are defining the function
05:01 - here like Def and function name is paint
05:07 - suppose calculation paint calculation
05:10 - right and in bracket
05:12 - 3
05:14 - argument it should accept height width
05:17 - and coverage right
05:19 - then only we can apply the formula so
05:22 - we are writing here like
05:24 - height comma
05:27 - width
05:31 - and cover over B you can say coverage
05:34 - both you can take same cover
05:36 - and here just calculate area area is
05:40 - equal to this height into
05:44 - width right
05:46 - now how to calculate number of gains
05:49 - number of
05:52 - cans have to calculate this area divided
05:55 - by
05:56 - this cover whatever this cover is or you
05:59 - can say coverage any variable you can
06:01 - take
06:02 - divide by cover
06:04 - all right and simply you can print
06:07 - here using a string like we are simply
06:10 - printing
06:12 - you will need how many cans
06:17 - uh we have that thing in this variable
06:20 - number of pens so just put that variable
06:22 - in braces these many number of friends
06:24 - or maybe you will need five
06:27 - and then we write
06:29 - cans of
06:31 - paint
06:33 - right something like this
06:36 - so just pass this function here sorry
06:39 - call the function here because to
06:41 - execute this function you have to call
06:42 - first so paint calculation and you have
06:44 - to pass now three
06:47 - arguments so better to pass keyworded
06:49 - argument maybe first you will pass
06:51 - height first you will pass width that
06:53 - would be assigned to height
06:55 - and a positional argument would be some
06:58 - Maybe
06:59 - that will not give you proper results so
07:02 - better to pass keyworded
07:04 - arguments right so suppose first time
07:07 - passing width
07:09 - like w i d t h
07:12 - C width equal to automatically it is
07:14 - showing width equal to w
07:16 - then
07:18 - height equal to is equal to H and then
07:23 - in this definition we have cover so same
07:27 - okay sorry
07:31 - here we will write down same cover cover
07:34 - equal to automated showing cover is
07:36 - equal to
07:37 - coverage
07:38 - this function coverage and let's call it
07:41 - right so these are keyworded so that is
07:44 - why this width would be assigned to this
07:46 - width only
07:47 - if you simply write down first W then H
07:51 - then coverage rather than keyword it
07:53 - then whatever the width that would be
07:55 - assigned to height according to
07:57 - positional arguments right so this is
08:00 - fine now right I hope that is not this
08:04 - is not so much stuff so let's run this
08:09 - and see what output you will get first
08:11 - it is asking in the height of meter uh
08:13 - wall suppose three and width may be
08:17 - suppose four
08:18 - so you will need 1.714 this cans of
08:22 - paint but obviously we cannot buy 1.7 we
08:25 - will buy two cans right so one thing is
08:28 - still remaining you have to round this
08:32 - function up around this number up number
08:34 - of gains so either in a separate line
08:38 - you can
08:39 - in number of cans you can just round up
08:42 - this number using seal function right
08:44 - seal is from maths module math module so
08:48 - whatever function you will use you have
08:50 - to import that module first so first
08:52 - import math
08:55 - import math right now you can use seal
08:59 - so directly here only how to use see
09:02 - from random module if you want to use
09:04 - any function like
09:06 - choice so you will first try you have
09:09 - written first the module name random dot
09:11 - the method name choice so same here
09:13 - first write down module name math
09:16 - Dot
09:18 - sales your automated showing C right and
09:22 - in Seal we simply write down this
09:24 - formula area divided by cover so in one
09:27 - line only you can round this number up
09:29 - rather than using another line right or
09:33 - in another line also you can round up
09:35 - this number maybe another variable name
09:37 - you can take like n is equal to math dot
09:39 - seal and in bracket you can just pass
09:41 - number of cans and here you can write
09:42 - you will need n
09:44 - cancel print so let's run this
09:48 - for same height is 3 and 4 width is 4
09:52 - meter so you will need two cans of paint
09:55 - this time you're getting exact output
09:58 - right whatever you need
10:00 - so that's it this is how you can
10:02 - calculate the area
10:05 - of wall to paint right I think that's
10:07 - easy
10:10 - okay so I hope this was not so tough for
10:12 - you guys and you have done it and the
10:14 - next video we'll see one more coding
10:16 - exercise so now I'll see you in the next
10:17 - video till then bye take
