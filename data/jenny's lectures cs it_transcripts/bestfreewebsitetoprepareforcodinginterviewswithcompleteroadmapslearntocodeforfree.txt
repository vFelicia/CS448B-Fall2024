02:53 - only on the platform by yourself so let
02:56 - me show you everything one by one see
02:58 - this is the platform uh the code studio
03:01 - by coding ninjas
03:03 - first of all
03:04 - if you are a beginner right and you want
03:06 - to get you ready for placement right you
03:09 - should go to guided paths

03:25 - move the path they'll show you
03:28 - so if you are a beginner you don't know
03:30 - anything first of all you can choose any
03:32 - programming language see dsa is very
03:34 - important for interview preparation of
03:36 - these companies data structure and
03:37 - algorithm for solving those problems
03:40 - obviously you should have knowledge of
03:41 - any programming language so you can go
03:42 - for this basics of c plus java or python
03:45 - up to you right
03:47 - and you will get a certificate also
03:49 - after completion right now let me just
03:50 - open one uh guide path for you
03:53 - let's say basics of c plus plus
03:55 - now
03:56 - what you will get here once you will you
03:59 - know click here get started you just log
04:01 - in with your google or facebook account
04:03 - or you can just create an account with
04:05 - your email address right
04:07 - now what is this in this module they
04:09 - have
04:10 - shown you what you will get see
04:12 - this is the module introduction to c
04:14 - plus first of all here you will get
04:15 - seven nodes theory you will get after
04:17 - that three problems also mcqs also you
04:20 - will get of 30 points you can attempt
04:22 - these question
04:24 - same then variables and data type first
04:26 - of all nodes you will get and then
04:27 - problems these are simple problems mcqs
04:31 - right once you go to this this thing
04:34 - like from basic to advanced everything
04:36 - they are going to discuss with nodes and
04:38 - problems right
04:40 - now you can solve dsa problems right you
04:43 - can go for dsa the guided path of data
04:46 - structure and algorithm here same you
04:48 - will get theory also notes as well as
04:50 - problems
04:51 - right
04:53 - competitive programming many
04:55 - for many things there are guided paths
04:57 - not it's not like that you should go for
04:59 - this uh you know
05:01 - c plus plus java or dsa for aptitude
05:03 - preparation as well
05:05 - because in interview first round is for
05:07 - apti so that also available here you can
05:09 - go for this thing
05:10 - right and
05:12 - the technology which are in trending see
05:14 - blockchain data science machine learning
05:18 - you will get here
05:20 - you know the path for this thing also
05:22 - blockchain machine learning data
05:24 - data science system design right
05:27 - now
05:28 - also a path for interview guide for
05:30 - product based companies
05:32 - so this also
05:33 - i think then you you should go for this
05:36 - thing if you are a beginner first you
05:37 - can go for programming then dsa you can
05:39 - learn then interview guide for product
05:41 - based companies here you will get c
05:44 - array the topic is array note you will
05:46 - get first of all the notes theory and
05:47 - then problems so you should try these
05:49 - problems
05:51 - see pair some problem overlapping
05:53 - problem you can attempt these problems
05:54 - from here right if you will click on the
05:57 - attempt the interface would be something
05:59 - like this right first of all read out
06:01 - this problem
06:03 - the difficult level of this problem is
06:05 - easy read out this problem statement
06:07 - notes everything first of all understand
06:08 - this problem input format output form
06:10 - and everything you need to understand
06:12 - right and then you can code here you can
06:15 - code here either in your python java c
06:18 - plus plus or javascript then you should
06:20 - run this
06:21 - test your problem against sample cases
06:23 - and then you can submit this problem
06:24 - right so this is the interface you can
06:26 - attempt the problem
06:27 - here
06:28 - right so for array then you will get
06:31 - multi-dimensional array string recursion
06:33 - and everything
06:34 - you will get here
06:36 - right which are asked in which would be
06:38 - the topics which are important for into
06:40 - preparation of product based companies
06:42 - problems of that you will get okay this
06:44 - is done now maybe
06:46 - okay you want to practice more problems
06:50 - so you can go for practice section and
06:52 - interview problems
06:54 - from there you will get interview
06:55 - problems of specific topic like for
06:58 - programming fundamentals
07:01 - data structure
07:02 - you can select any topic advanced
07:04 - algorithm maths and number theory so you
07:06 - can select a particular topic and solve
07:09 - the problem of that topic if you want
07:12 - right
07:12 - from here see these are the problems you
07:15 - can filter out these problems according
07:17 - to yourself like dynamic programming
07:19 - problem
07:20 - which which
07:22 - which you know filter you want to apply
07:25 - you can select this thing the topic wise
07:27 - you can select company wise you can
07:29 - select for which company see suppose you

07:33 - being asked in amazon so you can select
07:36 - this
07:36 - amazon and there you will get these
07:38 - problems right
07:40 - make my trip microsoft you can apply any
07:42 - filter you want there are many filters
07:44 - difficult level filter also the easy
07:46 - mode rate hard
07:48 - apply the filter according to that the
07:49 - problem would be shown here and you can
07:51 - just click on that problem interface i
07:53 - have already shown you like which
07:55 - interface which type of interface you
07:56 - will get and you so you can solve the
07:58 - problem according to topic wise now
08:01 - top problem list is also there
