00:00 - hey everyone so in this video I am going
00:02 - to discuss about one of the best and
00:04 - free resource to start your interview
00:05 - preparation journey by learning data
00:07 - structure and algorithms now you can
00:10 - start your interview preparation by
00:12 - working on this amazing free resource on
00:14 - data structure and algorithms guided
00:16 - python code Studio see when you start
00:19 - preparing for interview interviews it's
00:21 - very important that you can find all the
00:23 - DSA resources at one place and in a
00:26 - structured way right like Theory plus as
00:29 - well as some practice problems so you
00:32 - assert and at this amazing free guided
00:35 - path of data structure and algorithms
00:37 - now before moving to this like how you
00:40 - can follow this kind of path let me just
00:42 - tell you what are the prerequisite for
00:43 - this
00:44 - at the data section and algorithm guided
00:46 - path
00:47 - prerequisite is what it's nothing much
00:50 - but you should have basic knowledge of
00:52 - programming right then you can easily
00:56 - follow this guided path
00:58 - right now why you should go for this
01:00 - guided path only see first this carried
01:03 - path covers all the topics like from
01:06 - basic to advanced level data structure
01:08 - topics in a structured way with notes
01:11 - detailed explanation plus some practice
01:14 - problems for all the topics covered
01:17 - right and in this credit part they will
01:20 - cover all the important topics of data
01:22 - structure and algorithms like complexity
01:24 - analysis time complexity space
01:26 - complexity right arrays strings
01:30 - multi-dimensional arrays trees Stacks
01:33 - queues Ling list try data structure bit
01:36 - manipulation dynamic programming
01:38 - backtracking and binary search linked
01:43 - list so all the important topics will be
01:45 - covered here and average time to finish
01:47 - this carried path is what 120 days not
01:50 - only this you can unlock the free
01:52 - certificate once you complete 80 of this
01:54 - guided path right now let me just show
01:57 - you how you can follow this guided path
01:59 - so the first step is you need to first
02:02 - of all log in on code Studio the link
02:03 - I'll put in the description box of this
02:05 - video right don't worry now then you
02:07 - will click on the tab this guided path
02:10 - and you will see here guided paths like
02:12 - data structure and algorithm under this
02:14 - tab for beginners these are guided paths
02:17 - for intermediate you will find one data
02:20 - structure and algorithm this right and
02:22 - then you can click on start learning
02:24 - right now let me just show you the
02:27 - modules what this carried path will
02:30 - cover right first see the com module one
02:33 - is complexity analysis this one so let
02:36 - me just click on this first you will get
02:38 - complete nodes
02:40 - see as you can see the complete nodes
02:42 - about time complexity right and then
02:45 - about space complexity then mcqs these
02:48 - are some mcqs the questions right you
02:51 - can just answer this question quick
02:53 - submit end next right like this this is
02:57 - the pattern for every module first query
02:59 - nodes plus then some mcqs plus practice
03:02 - questions then second module is arrays
03:06 - algorithms this is very important that's
03:08 - in the national flag algorithms
03:10 - searching and sorting prefix some suffix
03:12 - some mixed problems so see let me just
03:15 - click on one more thing
03:28 - once you click on this here see this is
03:30 - the problem statement read this problem
03:33 - statement then input what should be the
03:34 - input what should be the output
03:36 - everything and then you can write down
03:38 - your code here you can just select your
03:40 - language like Java or python or C plus
03:43 - plus in which you are comfortable you
03:44 - can select that language and write down
03:46 - the code and you can just submit it
03:48 - right like this
03:51 - and third module is string same
03:53 - introduction to Strings and then some
03:55 - problems then basic algorithms two
03:57 - pointer technique sliding window
03:58 - technique
04:00 - multi-dimensional arrays first of all
04:02 - Theory then some problems mcqs right
04:05 - recursion and backtracking
04:07 - like this popular here let me just click
04:11 - on this tab this popular problems so
04:14 - Sudoku reach the destination path in a
04:17 - Mage and end Queen puzzle so you can
04:20 - click on here you can see the detailed
04:22 - statement here first of all read this
04:25 - what is the problem statement then you
04:27 - can write down your code here and you
04:28 - can submit right so first read the notes
04:31 - the query and then go to the problems
04:34 - and solve them right then sorting all
04:36 - the Sorting algorithms C nodes for every
04:39 - sorting algorithm selection bubble
04:41 - insertion see you will get here notes
04:44 - first
04:45 - with proper examples right
04:49 - right and then problem based on sorting
04:51 - like these are some problems
04:54 - you can solve here
04:56 - same pattern you will get in every
04:57 - module so they'll cover all the
04:59 - important topics of data structure and
05:01 - algorithm binary search
05:04 - right linked list link list reversal
05:07 - sorting and
05:09 - stacks and queues then right then trees
05:14 - tree traversal standard problems on
05:16 - trees and all then binary search trees
05:18 - right
05:20 - and then priority queues and heaps
05:23 - first of all notes then implementation
05:25 - and conversion based problems and K
05:28 - based problems application based
05:29 - problems and see these problems are
05:32 - being asked in these companies like
05:33 - Amazon Samsung Microsoft these problems
05:36 - you will get here so that would be very
05:38 - you know beneficial for you guys because
05:41 - Under One Roof you are getting
05:43 - everything notes plus problems plus mcqs
05:46 - so it's very good I guess DP problems
05:49 - dynamic problem programming problems
05:51 - then price
05:53 - with manipulation right then greedy
05:56 - algorithms
05:58 - then some miscellaneous topics like hash
06:01 - map circular views dqs doubly link list
06:03 - circular Ling list and string algorithms
06:06 - right and if you have more doubts you
06:09 - can go to these FAQ section also right
06:12 - and this this after completing 80
06:14 - percent of this guided path you can
06:16 - unlock the free certificate right here
06:18 - see
06:19 - you can without penalty you can unlock
06:21 - this free certificate right and this is
06:24 - absolutely free so all the relevant
06:26 - links and details I'll put in the
06:27 - description box of this video you can go
06:29 - and check out so now it's in the next
06:30 - video till then bye take care
