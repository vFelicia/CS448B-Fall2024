00:13 - friendly course so if you don't know
00:15 - coding abcd of coding if you know you
00:17 - have no prior experience of coding it's
00:19 - okay
00:20 - you can learn python it will be a
00:21 - beginner friendly course right now what
00:24 - you will get in this course what i am
00:26 - going to cover obviously video lectures
00:28 - query part
00:30 - as well as quiz
00:32 - right plus some coding exercises you can
00:36 - say or you can say some assignments
00:38 - right
00:39 - and projects also will be working first
00:42 - of all you will be starting from a very
00:43 - simple project then we'll move to our
00:46 - like intermediate project high level
00:48 - projects the complexity right maybe the
00:51 - first one or two projects you'll be
00:53 - thinking i'm
00:54 - you will be saying like ma'am really
00:57 - these are projects
00:59 - very simple projects but yeah for a
01:01 - beginner definitely
01:03 - i am going to call those things a
01:04 - project
01:05 - because whenever you will complete that
01:08 - thing although it's very simple but
01:09 - whenever you will complete that thing it
01:11 - will boost up your confidence yes i have
01:13 - completed one project in python
01:16 - right
01:17 - although these are not of that level
01:19 - starting projects that you can mention
01:20 - in your resume but definitely at last
01:22 - whatever project you'll be covering
01:24 - those you can mention your resume like
01:26 - maybe it depends on you know uh maybe
01:28 - you can create some games and these kind
01:30 - of things
01:31 - you know
01:32 - uh analysis of data and patterns and all
01:35 - these kind of projects also will be
01:37 - making in this course
01:39 - right
01:40 - so first thing what i want from you guys
01:43 - is some you can say tips for you guys
01:47 - you have to make your own notes
01:49 - right maybe i can provide you also my
01:52 - notes my handwritten notes
01:54 - right
01:55 - i'm also thinking this thing like i can
01:58 - provide you but better to you know
02:00 - prepare your own notes also
02:03 - whenever you write with your own hand
02:05 - then that thing will be in your mind for
02:07 - a longer period of time
02:09 - rather than you know
02:12 - reading from anyone others not
02:15 - maybe some important points or maybe you
02:17 - you are not able to you know understand
02:19 - my handwriting so better to make your
02:21 - own notes or maybe i can also provide
02:23 - you that
02:24 - i'm thinking about this thing because
02:26 - for that thing i have to you know
02:29 - make proper notes
02:31 - right
02:32 - second thing is
02:34 - practice is very important first of all
02:36 - you have to make note second thing you
02:37 - have to practice like daily
02:39 - one are you have to devote for this
02:41 - thing right it's not like that you are
02:43 - just
02:44 - opening the my lectures and watching the
02:45 - lectures and all no
02:47 - you have to keep your laptop ready with
02:49 - you whatever you have to install the id

02:52 - discuss one by one later in the later
02:54 - when you will you know in the later
02:55 - course the later videos
