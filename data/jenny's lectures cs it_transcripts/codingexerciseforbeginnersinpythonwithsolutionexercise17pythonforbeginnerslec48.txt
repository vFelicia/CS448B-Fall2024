00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language we have discussed
00:03 - in the previous video uh one coding is
00:05 - the size we have done one range function
00:07 - what is range function and then based on
00:08 - that one code exercise we have done
00:10 - right now in this videos we'll be
00:12 - discussing one question but that is
00:14 - actually a job interview question and
00:16 - this is the basic and the you can see
00:18 - the most important or the favorite
00:20 - question of interviewers they ask this
00:23 - in coding interviews right that is Fizz
00:27 - was job interview question I think you
00:30 - have heard about this a question now
00:32 - what is this question you have to write
00:33 - down a program right that will print
00:36 - number from 1 to n
00:39 - can be anything let's suppose one two
00:41 - hundred one two hundred you have to
00:44 - print number one two hundred so maybe
00:46 - you will say using range function we can
00:47 - simply print one two three something
00:49 - like this right but no there's a twist
00:52 - the numbers
00:54 - which are divisible by three rather than
00:56 - printing that number there it should
00:59 - print Fizz and the number divisible by
01:02 - five
01:03 - for that rather than printing that
01:05 - number it should print
01:07 - buzz and the number divisible by both
01:11 - three and five
01:15 - rather than printing that number it
01:17 - should print
01:19 - Ables
01:22 - other than that simply print the numbers
01:23 - like 1 then 2 then 3 is divisible by 3
01:27 - so rather than printing 3 it should
01:29 - print fizzy then three then four then
01:32 - five is divisible by five so rather than
01:34 - five it will print buzz like this then 6
01:38 - 6 is divisible by 3 so it will print
01:41 - here Buzz like this it will print till
01:44 - 100 the numbers
01:46 - so I think that's very easy
01:49 - you must be thinking like there are only
01:50 - three condition you have to put in for
01:53 - Loop you can put these three conditions
01:54 - that's just a hint but here one twist is
01:58 - in which order you are putting these
02:00 - conditions that also matters
02:02 - okay
02:03 - so this is just a simple hint you need
02:05 - to take care now pause the video and try
02:07 - this out before
02:09 - seeing the solution right so I hope you
02:11 - have done this exercise now let's check
02:14 - the solution create a new file here and
02:17 - that is
02:19 - fizzbuzz
02:21 - dot p y
02:23 - okay
02:25 - directly
02:26 - because you have to put a for Loop right
02:30 - on the Range one two hundred and then
02:33 - simply put three condition right okay
02:36 - let's write down four
02:39 - I'm taking an variable M number in and
02:42 - the range will be taking
02:45 - what from 1 to 100 I want so one two one
02:47 - zero one
02:48 - right
02:51 - now in this for Loop we'll be checking
02:54 - condition maybe if you write something
02:56 - like this simply write down three
02:58 - conditions like if we'll check the
03:00 - number first of all it says divisible by
03:03 - three so I will check mode three equal
03:06 - to equal to zero then simply it will
03:08 - print
03:10 - face
03:11 - right next condition L if
03:15 - this number
03:18 - is divisible by 5
03:21 - then simply will print
03:24 - Buzz
03:26 - right
03:29 - LF
03:30 - if the number is divisible by both three
03:32 - and ah
03:34 - 5. so mode 3 equal to equal to 0 and
03:39 - number mode 5 equal to equal to zero
03:43 - both the conditions are true then it
03:46 - will print what
03:49 - phase Buzz
03:52 - okay other than this other than this it
03:55 - will print simply the number so in that
03:59 - will you know the sales part will catch
04:01 - up that thing so print in else will
04:04 - simply print the number
04:06 - maybe you're thinking that's it okay
04:08 - let's see rather than now till this we
04:12 - will take this till 1 to 10 okay to make
04:15 - it easy for you to understand
04:17 - so 1 to 11 I am taking the range let's
04:20 - run this
04:21 - C
04:23 - what it will printing
04:28 - one two then fish then four then Buzz
04:31 - then fifth seven eight piss Buzz then
04:33 - fist then Buzz for 10.
04:37 - you must be thinking it's right right
04:40 - okay but no no no don't say
04:43 - congratulations to you there is some
04:44 - problem in this code if I run this code
04:48 - 1 to 16 because if 15 is divisible by
04:53 - both 3 and 5.
04:55 - so according to the question at 15 it
04:58 - should print Fizz was right okay let's
05:00 - run this and see
05:02 - see after 14 13 14 at the place of 15 it
05:08 - is printing just Fizz but it is
05:10 - divisible by both 3 and 5 so it should
05:12 - print visuals
05:13 - then you have something wrong with this
05:16 - code okay see now once 15 in number 15
05:19 - is being assigned so 15 is divisible
05:22 - first condition would be checked
05:23 - obviously sequentially it will go the
05:25 - control
05:27 - 15 divisible by 3 15 more 3 equal to 0
05:30 - yes it is divisible by three so it will
05:32 - print simply phys because this condition
05:34 - is true and once
05:38 - it finds one condition is true it will
05:40 - not check other conditions so it will
05:42 - skip all the other part
05:44 - but we want that at this time this
05:46 - condition should be checked
05:48 - so how it is possible
05:50 - we can write down this condition
05:54 - here at first place right and after that
05:57 - these two conditions so that may work I
06:00 - don't know let's see
06:02 - if rather than writing here I am writing
06:05 - this thing
06:06 - here
06:08 - so we'll simply print first we'll check
06:10 - this condition if this is the case
06:12 - printf is else sorry l a
06:16 - L if number division by 3 then press
06:19 - then 5 then Buzz
06:20 - so you can write down number this
06:23 - condition
06:24 - before here rather than 3 you can check
06:27 - with 5 and here you can check with 3
06:29 - that is fine because they are these are
06:30 - not overlapping right so simply I'm
06:33 - adding 3 then 5 in else part will simply
06:35 - print the number let's run this on this
06:37 - board
06:39 - see now add that that 15 number it is
06:42 - printing fizzbuzz now it's working fine
06:45 - I am not saying that this is you know a
06:48 - clean and maintainable code and the best
06:51 - code I have you know I have written for
06:53 - this problem no but this is one solution
06:56 - there may be many solutions right
07:00 - just to make your code like more
07:02 - maintainable and clean and all rather
07:04 - than writing these elephant and if
07:07 - statement multiple times maybe you can
07:10 - use one solution we have that you can
07:12 - use switch statement also all right
07:14 - because see in this case
07:16 - if the number is like there's a number
07:20 - seven so I want rather than
07:22 - first of all it will check this
07:24 - condition then this condition then this
07:25 - condition and then it will go here and
07:27 - it will print seven so rather than
07:29 - checking all the condition I want it
07:31 - should directly print seven rather than
07:32 - checking all the condition that means
07:34 - you know
07:36 - it would take I think less time so for
07:38 - that we can use switch case statement
07:40 - also but this is one way to solve this
07:42 - problem right I hope you heard the logic
07:44 - now you can try this out the different
07:45 - different ways you can solve this
07:47 - problem right
07:48 - so this problem is the favorite one to
07:50 - be asked in coding interviews
07:52 - so you must try this out right so I hope
07:55 - if any interviewer asks this question
07:57 - from you you can easily answer this
07:59 - question you can easily write down the
08:00 - logic and all right
08:02 - now in the next video we will uh be
08:05 - seeing one python project we'll make a
08:06 - python project one we have done that is
08:08 - rock paper scissor the second project is
08:10 - this in this series right so now I'll
08:13 - say the next little till then bye bye
08:14 - take care
