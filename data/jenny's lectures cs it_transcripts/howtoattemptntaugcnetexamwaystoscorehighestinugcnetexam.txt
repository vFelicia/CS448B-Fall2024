00:00 - so in this video i'm going to discuss
00:02 - some tips about how to attempt
00:04 - ugc net exam so that you can solve
00:07 - maximum number of question within that
00:09 - time limit because to crack any exam two
00:12 - things are very important first one is
00:14 - your preparation
00:15 - second one is your performance on your
00:17 - day of exam on your final day
00:19 - that is also equally important no matter
00:22 - how well you have prepared
00:24 - if you are not able to perform well
00:27 - on that day on your exam day right many
00:30 - students
00:31 - have asked me this doubt that how to
00:34 - solve questions on that day how to
00:35 - attempt this exam net exam so that we
00:38 - can get maximum marks
00:40 - right so the very first thing is what it
00:44 - is not necessary to solve the question
00:46 - from question number one like
00:47 - sequentially one two three four like
00:49 - this
00:50 - it is not necessary you can solve any
00:52 - question
00:54 - because many students always start yeah
00:56 - it's okay you can start from question
00:58 - number one
00:59 - but it is not a rule that you have to
01:01 - start from one then
01:03 - second question third like this you can
01:05 - solve
01:06 - any random question yeah it's good to go
01:09 - sequentially but sometime what happens
01:11 - is what suppose you have solved first
01:12 - second
01:13 - question though those were easy but
01:15 - third question is taking much time
01:17 - like three or four minutes fourth
01:18 - question is also taking much time like
01:20 - five minutes you have devoted for
01:21 - solving those
01:22 - third fourth and fifth question right
01:25 - maybe you have got the answer
01:26 - right but what matters is what because
01:29 - of this
01:30 - sequential process you have devoted much
01:32 - time in
01:33 - it in starting phase only right and
01:36 - suppose after 30 minutes
01:37 - you are you have sold only 10 questions
01:40 - or 12 questions or 15 questions then
01:41 - there would be mental mental pressure on
01:43 - you
01:44 - right so in first go it's not
01:47 - no all it's not any rule that you should
01:49 - go sequentially you can solve any random
01:51 - question you can skip those questions
01:53 - who are taking much time
01:54 - right so next is this point only
01:59 - you should solve easy question in first
02:02 - go
02:02 - like you have read that question and you
02:04 - got the answer
02:06 - means immediate answer you are getting
02:08 - you just solve those question in first
02:11 - go right in second go try to solve
02:14 - some tough type of questions or those
02:16 - questions which are taking your time
02:18 - yeah you can solve those questions you
02:20 - know the concept but those are taking
02:22 - some time
02:22 - in second go you should solve those
02:24 - question third
02:26 - point is what you don't need to panic if
02:28 - you are not able to solve first few
02:30 - questions
02:31 - like suppose in one go obviously you
02:34 - should solve easy question like easy
02:36 - question means
02:37 - you have read you are reading the that
02:38 - question and you just got the answer
02:40 - at that time only within one or two
02:42 - second or three second or five seconds
02:44 - right but suppose first maybe uh 10
02:47 - question or 12 questions are like this
02:49 - you are not able to
02:50 - get answer immediately it's okay you can
02:53 - skip those questions
02:54 - you are not supposed to panic at that
02:56 - time it happens
02:58 - in second go you can solve those
02:59 - questions this is very important
03:02 - right next is read the questions
03:06 - carefully with full concentration it's
03:09 - not like that in first attempt you are
03:10 - reading the question you are not getting
03:12 - what the question is then obviously you
03:13 - are not able to solve that question
03:15 - again you are reading that question in
03:17 - second time you are getting or third
03:18 - time you are getting the question
03:20 - no don't waste much time in reading
03:22 - questions
03:23 - right in first attempt only read
03:25 - question very carefully so that you can
03:28 - get the answer
03:28 - you don't need to read the question
03:30 - again this is
03:32 - very silly mistake many students do
03:34 - because see here
03:35 - every second matters you are supposed to
03:38 - invest your time in solving the question
03:40 - not just
03:41 - reading the question fine do not take
03:44 - any
03:44 - question on your ego many students do
03:46 - this thing like
03:47 - i have read that concept very carefully
03:51 - i have practiced
03:52 - many questions on this topic so i'll
03:55 - solve this question
03:56 - maybe sometimes the question is tricky
03:58 - or maybe because of
04:00 - other you know situations your mental
04:02 - pressure you are not able to solve that
04:03 - question
04:04 - it's okay that happens so please it's
04:07 - not like that i'm not able to solve this
04:08 - question but i have practiced many
04:11 - this type of question so yeah i i'll
04:13 - solve this question no matter what no
04:15 - matter how much time it is going to take
04:17 - please do not do this thing do not take
04:19 - any question on your ego just leave that
04:21 - if
04:21 - it is taking much time like two three or
04:23 - more than five minutes then it's better
04:25 - to leave that question first
04:26 - yeah if you have time and last you can
04:29 - solve that question
04:30 - at that time why i'm saying this at in
04:33 - starting in the first word don't just
04:35 - stick to one question right why i'm
04:38 - saying this
04:38 - because sometimes it happens the the
04:41 - question
04:42 - like suppose the question you are
04:43 - reading is number five and maybe the
04:44 - answer of that question you will get in
04:46 - question number 25 so it's better to go
04:49 - through all the question first
04:51 - right maybe you can get the answer of
04:52 - that question in for the
04:54 - later questions right so next step is
04:58 - you can try eliminating technique if you
05:00 - don't know the answer maybe sometimes
05:02 - it happens you have four options and you
05:04 - know that these two options
05:05 - are not the answer definitely right so
05:08 - you can discard those options
05:10 - and from those remaining two
05:13 - you just try to find out the answer so
05:15 - this is kind of eliminating technique
05:17 - right so you can try this one also and
05:19 - next
05:20 - is last but not the least this is also
05:22 - very important
05:24 - there is no negative marking so do not
05:26 - leave
05:27 - any question unanswered at last maybe
05:30 - you are supposed having five minutes and
05:32 - you know you don't have much time to
05:33 - solve the question then you just
05:36 - open that question mark either a b c or
05:39 - d
05:40 - please do not leave any question
05:41 - unanswered maybe your
05:43 - guess would be correct right so i think
05:46 - out of these this thing is very
05:48 - important
05:49 - in first go do not stick to just one
05:51 - question
05:52 - solve easy questions those questions you
05:55 - can get
05:56 - immediate answer after reading after
05:57 - reading that question right
05:59 - because it's starting if you stuck
06:02 - somewhere
06:03 - if you stuck in any question and you
06:05 - have devoted your five minutes ten
06:06 - minutes in that question
06:08 - right maybe two questions are like this
06:10 - and you have devoted your five five four
06:11 - ten ten minutes in those questions
06:13 - so definitely because that cloak is
06:15 - ticking right
06:16 - definitely you will come under pressure
06:18 - that many questions are still left
06:21 - and time is not there so please don't
06:23 - waste much time on a particular type of
06:25 - question
06:26 - right so now i have an update for csir
