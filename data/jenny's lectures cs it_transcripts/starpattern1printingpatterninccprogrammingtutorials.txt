00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:01 - c we have discussed all the loops four
00:03 - while dual as well as we have discussed
00:05 - nested loops nested four nested while
00:07 - listed do i do right
00:09 - so now from this video i'm going to
00:11 - start discussing some programs
00:13 - printing pattern programs 5410 printing
00:16 - pattern programs we are going to discuss
00:17 - right but first in this video we will
00:19 - discuss how to print this pattern
00:21 - right but first please check out that
00:24 - video where
00:24 - i have discussed what is need of nested
00:27 - loops
00:28 - right in that video i have discussed how
00:31 - to print
00:32 - a pattern like like this this pattern
00:36 - this kind of pattern i have discussed in
00:38 - that video right
00:40 - this video would be very basic and this
00:42 - video will be really very
00:44 - helpful to get all the programs that are
00:47 - we are going to discuss
00:48 - all the printing pattern programs here
00:49 - this is the basic video so please i
00:51 - recommend you to check this video first
00:53 - i'll put the link of that video in this
00:55 - i button
00:55 - you can check out in this video you will
00:58 - get the idea why we are using two for
01:00 - loops
01:01 - every single line the meaning of every
01:03 - single line i have discussed with proper
01:04 - example so that would
01:06 - really this video would be really
01:07 - helpful for you please check out that
01:09 - video first and then come to this video
01:11 - then you will get this video very easily
01:13 - right so now see here
01:16 - i am printing five lines and in each
01:19 - line i am printing
01:20 - five stars but the pattern is this one
01:23 - lines i am printing five but in first
01:27 - line i am printing one star
01:28 - then two star and three then four then
01:30 - five and this could be like this you can
01:33 - print
01:33 - ten lines right and in this line
01:36 - six star then seven start eight 9 and 10
01:39 - these kind of
01:41 - no pattern you can print it this is what
01:43 - a triangle see
01:45 - now i'm going to discuss this one only
01:48 - the logic
01:48 - on this board will drive in that program
01:51 - after
01:52 - i am not writing the complete program
01:53 - here but after that after discussing the
01:55 - logic
01:56 - i'll show you the output on that vs code
01:59 - on that that ide right on my laptop
02:02 - so please i have in the previous video i
02:05 - have already told you please install vs
02:06 - code as well as that
02:08 - compiler mingw and extension like code
02:10 - runner for
02:11 - your compiling the program and running
02:14 - the program right
02:15 - so i hope you are done with it if you
02:17 - are not
02:18 - done and if you are facing any problem
02:19 - you can tell me i'll
02:21 - make a video i'll upload a video on that
02:23 - thing also like how to install vs code
02:25 - or
02:25 - compiler and everything right so now get
02:28 - your laptop
02:29 - ready now see i'm just going to discuss
02:32 - the logic here
02:33 - so now here two for loop you need nested
02:36 - for loop why
02:37 - why the reason you will get when you
02:39 - watch this video one for loop is to
02:41 - print these lines
02:42 - how many lines five lines right so outer
02:46 - for loop would be you will take a
02:47 - variable i or j you can take any
02:49 - variable right
02:50 - and in a for loop you are actually
02:53 - printing
02:54 - so in first line i am printing 1 star in
02:56 - second line
02:57 - 2 star right so when i is equal to 1
03:01 - means this line i is equal to 2 means
03:05 - you are printing this line
03:06 - i is equal to 3 this i is equal to 4 and
03:09 - i is equal to
03:10 - 5 but if i is equal to 1 then
03:14 - the inner loop would be j
03:17 - right here i am printing j should run
03:20 - how many times
03:21 - only single time because only one time i
03:24 - am printing
03:25 - star here when i is equal to 1 then j
03:28 - was
03:29 - running how many times 5 times when i is
03:32 - equal to two
03:33 - at that time also j was running
03:36 - five times right please check out this
03:39 - video first after that come to this
03:40 - video
03:41 - now when i is equal to two then j is
03:43 - running how many times
03:45 - two times one and two two times i am
03:48 - printing
03:49 - right so how to print actually
03:52 - just write down a for loop j is equal to
03:54 - one
03:55 - right and j less than equal to now
03:58 - here j is not x here j was fixed
04:01 - 5 so i have written j less than equal to
04:04 - 5
04:05 - because every line i am printing star 5
04:07 - times but here
04:09 - j is what changing first 1 time then 2
04:12 - then 3 stars and four stars and five
04:14 - star
04:15 - so now what you can write here see
04:19 - i one j is running one time
04:22 - i is equal to two in second line j is
04:24 - running two times
04:26 - when i is three j is running 3 times 1 2
04:29 - 3 here 4 times here 5 times
04:32 - so i hope you are getting my point j
04:34 - should be less than equal to
04:35 - [Music]
04:37 - i type and j plus plus
04:40 - and within this you are just printing
04:46 - star this is inner loop right
04:49 - and we are repeating this again and
04:51 - again so we will put these statements in
04:54 - outer loop that is 4 i is equal to 1
04:58 - and i less than equal to now i is what
05:01 - number of
05:01 - lines outer for loop is what to print
05:04 - number of
05:05 - lines how many lines 5 lines so i less
05:09 - than equal to
05:10 - 5 right and i plus plus
05:16 - and as well as in the
05:19 - after this inner loop in the outer loop
05:21 - what you have to print because
05:22 - after printing one star next two stars
05:25 - should be printed in
05:26 - next line next three star should be
05:28 - printed in
05:30 - next line right so after the inner loop
05:33 - completion
05:34 - after running the inner loop two times
05:37 - then
05:38 - new line then again new line after each
05:40 - line
05:41 - a new line so new line how many times
05:44 - you need new line operator
05:46 - one two three four and five
05:49 - or obviously you can say four right
05:52 - so now 5 5 times so now new line
05:56 - operator we will print
05:57 - we will write down in outer loop
06:01 - not an inner loop right so now
06:04 - that's it this is the logic you can see
06:09 - when we dry run this program i i is
06:12 - equal to
06:13 - 1 i less than equal to 5 yes condition
06:16 - is true
06:16 - so now control will enter here now j is
06:18 - equal to one so now j is also
06:20 - one at first j less than equal to i i
06:23 - value is one
06:25 - j one j is also one one less than equal
06:27 - to one yes condition true so control
06:28 - will enter here
06:29 - so now we are just printing what star
06:32 - first
06:33 - right now j plus plus j becomes 2 2 less
06:36 - than equal to i
06:37 - i is 1 is condition true no so control
06:39 - will go
06:40 - out of the loop immediately what
06:42 - statement we have written after
06:44 - after this loop printf slash n so now
06:46 - cursor would move to
06:48 - next line right now
06:52 - i plus plus because now we are in outer
06:54 - loop i plus plus now i becomes 2
06:56 - 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition
06:57 - true again enter into this loop
07:00 - now what again j is equal to 1 so j
07:02 - would be initialized again to
07:04 - 1 now 1 less than equal to
07:07 - i is 2 yes condition is true control
07:10 - will enter here again we are going to
07:11 - print here
07:12 - star j plus plus now j becomes 2 2 less
07:16 - than equal to 2 because i is
07:17 - 2 here yes condition is true again we
07:20 - are going to print 1 star
07:22 - now j plus plus j becomes 3 is 3 less
07:24 - than equal to 2
07:25 - no now control will go out of the loop
07:28 - and slash and slashing means now cursor
07:30 - would be
07:31 - next fly now i plus plus now i becomes 3
07:34 - 3 less than equal to 5 yes condition
07:36 - true again enter here
07:37 - right again j would be initialized with
07:40 - 1
07:41 - so now again check the condition and
07:42 - this should be repeated
07:45 - right now in this line three star will
07:48 - be printed next
07:49 - next four star will be printed next five
07:51 - stars should be
07:53 - printed when i becomes five
07:56 - finally when i becomes six i plus plus
07:59 - means i become six
08:01 - now six less than equal to five
08:02 - condition is not true
08:04 - so now control will go out of this four
08:06 - loop
08:07 - right and now this pattern should be
08:09 - printed
08:10 - in the previous program here what we
08:14 - were writing here
08:15 - rj less than equal to 5 that's it this
08:19 - is the only change in this program so if
08:21 - you got this program
08:23 - right by watching the previous video
08:25 - then you can easily modify
08:27 - according to the pattern right so now
08:30 - let me show you i hope you you got it
08:32 - now let me show you this program on that
08:35 - terminal see so now let me show you the
08:38 - same program on this ide now
08:41 - let me create one more file pattern
08:44 - 2 dot c i have already created pattern 1
08:47 - right
08:47 - so now see
09:04 - i hope you can include the header file
09:05 - and you can write down small void mean
09:07 - so now we are going to take two variable
09:09 - i and
09:11 - j right and two for loops outer for loop
09:15 - would be to print
09:16 - line so i is equal to one semicolon i
09:19 - less than equal to how many lines i want
09:21 - to print according to the pad
09:22 - according to the pattern uh five lines
09:25 - right
09:26 - and now i plus plus and within this we
09:28 - are going to write one another for loop
09:30 - that is for j
09:32 - so j is also starting from 1 and j less
09:35 - than equal to
09:36 - i right and j plus plus
09:40 - fine and now within this inner for loop
09:43 - what you are doing you are printing star
09:48 - right and one more thing
09:51 - in this inner forum we are printing star
09:54 - and in outer for loop you are printing
09:56 - what
09:57 - new line right why new line we i already
10:01 - told you
10:02 - so now that's it let me run this and see
10:05 - what output you are getting
10:08 - see you are getting this this kind of
10:10 - output and this
10:11 - is what exactly what we want right this
10:14 - kind of
10:15 - ah pattern now if you want to print what
10:18 - 10 lines simply you have to write down
10:21 - here
10:22 - i less than equal to 10
10:25 - and that's it right 15 lines you can
10:28 - easily write down here 15 right whatever
10:31 - you want to print
10:32 - or if you are not you do don't want to
10:33 - do hard coding then you can just take a
10:35 - simple variable like
10:37 - n and at the runtime you can ask the
10:40 - from the user enter value of
10:42 - n and here you can write down i less
10:44 - than equal to n
10:46 - right so now that is also fine and this
10:48 - is what hard coding
10:50 - fine so i hope you got it now how to
10:53 - print
10:53 - these lines see for in the previous
10:56 - video i have told you
10:57 - what we are printing printing we are
11:00 - printing the star in a square pattern
11:02 - right like this this is the program this
11:05 - is the program pattern one let me run
11:07 - this program for you
11:08 - and what output you are getting this
11:09 - kind of output you are getting right
11:14 - in every line i am printing five star
11:17 - and i have five lines so that is why
11:18 - outer loop is
11:19 - less than equal to five and inner loop
11:21 - is also less than equal to five
11:23 - but in this case in first we are
11:26 - printing only one star
11:28 - in second line we are printing two star
11:31 - then three star then four star that is
11:32 - why we are printing here less than equal
11:34 - to
11:34 - i writing a less than equal to y so i
11:36 - hope you are getting my point now so now
11:38 - i hope you good how to print this
11:40 - pattern
11:40 - see please let me know in comment box if
11:42 - this processor of explaining
11:45 - the program is fine like first of all
11:47 - discuss it the logic on the
11:49 - whiteboard and then i'll show you the
11:51 - output on the
11:52 - screen on that laptop right or if you
11:55 - want me to change
11:56 - something you can suggest me in comment
11:58 - box so now i hope
12:00 - you you got this program now it's in the
12:03 - next video in that video we'll discuss
12:05 - some other pattern right so now tell
12:07 - them why take it
