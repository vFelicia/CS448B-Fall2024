00:00 - so in the series of learning C plus plus
00:02 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - Loops in C plus plus still now we have
00:05 - discussed for Loop and while loop the
00:06 - next one is dou y Loop and C plus plus
00:08 - so this thing we'll be discussing in
00:10 - this video what is do while loop General
00:12 - syntax of do while loop how to write
00:14 - down do I Loop in your program
00:15 - uh working of this Loop using uh with
00:18 - the help of flowchart as well as with
00:19 - the help of programs two to three
00:21 - programs we will see practical also I
00:23 - will show you on editor we will run
00:25 - those programs and all right plus how
00:27 - this is different from while loop right
00:30 - so these things all the basics all the
00:32 - points and you know about why we will be
00:35 - discussing in this video but before they
00:37 - just want to tell you one thing see the
00:39 - journey towards becoming a PSU officer
00:42 - and pursuing an M Tech from IIT and
00:44 - other Elite Institute is going to be
00:47 - tough and challenging right so for you
00:50 - to stay focused on your path here are

01:56 - relevant links and details I'll put in
01:58 - the description box of this video you
01:59 - can go and check out now let's see what
02:01 - is do I look let me just uh first of all
02:04 - tell you what is general syntax of this
02:06 - do I look first of all this new keyword
02:09 - write down you will write down followed
02:11 - by these curly braces Within These curly
02:13 - braces this would be body of the loop or
02:16 - you can say this is
02:18 - statement block
02:19 - right
02:21 - here you will write some statements
02:23 - which is to be executed and then after
02:25 - this curly braces we write while and
02:28 - here we write condition
02:30 - admission or you can say
02:32 - expression
02:34 - right termination condition or
02:36 - expression and after that this semicolon
02:39 - this is
02:40 - you know compulsory otherwise you will
02:42 - get an error right so this is General
02:44 - syntax of do while do I Loop right now
02:48 - these statements whatever you will write
02:50 - here these this should be executed again
02:52 - again and again while this condition is
02:54 - true
02:55 - condition is true these statement would
02:58 - be executed repeatedly right but one
03:00 - thing if this condition is not true
03:03 - still one time at least once this these
03:07 - statement would be executed this reason
03:10 - you know make this do while loop
03:13 - different from while loop in while loop
03:15 - if condition is not true
03:16 - body of the loop will not be executed
03:20 - right not even once but here at least
03:23 - once these statements the body of the
03:26 - loop would be executed at least once
03:29 - irrespective of the condition the
03:31 - condition is true or false it doesn't
03:32 - matter
03:33 - and after that after executing once this
03:36 - condition would be checked if condition
03:37 - is true now again this body of the loop
03:40 - would be executed the D statement would
03:42 - be executed till the condition becomes
03:45 - false
03:46 - right
03:47 - so how you can draw this thing in a
03:51 - flowchart see first obviously program is
03:55 - running somewhere we have do while loop
03:57 - so this is you can say body of loop
04:01 - body of dou by Loop
04:03 - right this will be executed irrespective
04:07 - of the condition now next after
04:09 - executing once condition would be
04:12 - checked
04:13 - so simply you can map this thing in
04:15 - flowchart condition would be checked
04:18 - if condition is true if condition is
04:21 - true
04:22 - again
04:24 - body of this this these statement would
04:26 - be executed
04:28 - if the condition is false now you can
04:30 - say exit from do while loop or whatever
04:33 - in your program you will write No
04:35 - statement would be executed but here we
04:37 - can say exit from Loop
04:39 - exit from Loop not exit from program
04:42 - exit from Loop so this is just flowchart
04:44 - basic flowchart of this do while loop
04:47 - right I hope you got the working of this
04:49 - Loop
04:50 - so this is known as exit control Loop
04:54 - two categories are there entry control
04:56 - four and while loop entry control Loop
04:59 - and this do while loop is exit
05:01 - controlled Loop while exiting from the
05:03 - loop we are checking the condition right
05:06 - so this is exit controlled Loop now let
05:09 - me just ah show you an example and let
05:12 - me just show you how this is different
05:14 - with look that example we'll see how
05:16 - this Loop is different from while loop
05:19 - right so sometimes uh we need like two
05:23 - you know execute the statements
05:26 - which are written in the loop of the
05:28 - body at least once without checking the
05:31 - condition sometimes this kind of this
05:32 - type of things happens those things also
05:35 - will discuss with the help of programs
05:36 - right so in those cases it's better to
05:39 - use do while loop rather than while loop
05:42 - right right because at least once we
05:44 - want to execute those statements after
05:46 - that
05:48 - I know we want that the condition should
05:50 - be checked right so in those cases we
05:53 - use dou y Loop now let's see how this is
05:56 - different from while loop
05:58 - so with the help of these two uh
06:00 - programs you will get the difference
06:03 - between while loop and do while loop one
06:04 - different C I'm just taking one variable
06:06 - I am initializing it with the zero now
06:09 - in do while loop I'm writing C out hi
06:11 - Jenny and the condition is while I
06:13 - greater than zero
06:15 - this is the condition right and after
06:17 - after that out of loop so what would be
06:19 - the output of this thing just pause the
06:20 - video and think
06:23 - so what output you will get here
06:27 - there is no condition I would be
06:28 - initialized with 0 then we will enter
06:30 - here then High Jenny would be printed
06:32 - right
06:34 - and e n d l means that would be in
06:37 - cursor will be next line now checking
06:38 - the condition while I greater than 0 is
06:40 - I greater than 0
06:42 - no I zero condition is not true so exit
06:44 - from the loop and just print out of loop
06:48 - the condition is not true still
06:50 - one time these statement would be
06:53 - executed the body of the loop but same
06:55 - in this case this is y loop I is 0
06:58 - while I greater than 0 is this condition
07:00 - true no so exit from the loop and it
07:03 - will just print out of loop
07:07 - here you can see the difference I have
07:10 - told you at least once the body of loop
07:12 - would be executed irrespective of the
07:14 - condition into my Loop right
07:16 - and you can also write down this while
07:18 - after this curly braces here while I
07:20 - greater than 0 but the semicolon is must
07:22 - But Here We cannot put any semicolon
07:25 - right now let's see we have seen one
07:29 - program of input validation in last
07:31 - video when we were discussing while loop
07:32 - so let let's write down that program
07:34 - with the help of do while loop you just
07:36 - pause the video and try out that program
07:38 - if you have seen my previous video that
07:39 - input validation I want a number user
07:42 - user to enter a number between one to
07:44 - five
07:46 - right
07:47 - so right on that program we do I'll
07:49 - pause the video and write down
07:51 - so this would be that code using the
07:53 - while loop we can write down some
07:55 - program for input validation
08:00 - we are checking input is valid or not
08:03 - I have declared a number a variable
08:06 - number then do after that here I'm
08:09 - writing enter a number between 1 and 5.
08:11 - so see number and the condition is
08:13 - while number less than equal to 1
08:17 - or not analogical or number greater than
08:21 - equal to 5 because I want between 1 and
08:24 - 5 not 1 or less than one or not five or
08:27 - greater than 5 right if this is the
08:30 - condition
08:31 - then repeat this thing again Ask from
08:34 - the user enter a number between 1 and 5.
08:36 - if the condition is this condition is
08:38 - true
08:39 - it will repeat if this condition is
08:41 - false if user has entered a number
08:43 - correct number then just print thanks
08:45 - suppose
08:47 - first we will run this and it will ask
08:49 - enter a number between 1 and 5 5 and I
08:51 - have entered 0. right
08:54 - check the condition number less than
08:55 - equal to 1 yes condition is true right
08:59 - condition true means again in the loop
09:01 - again it will ask enter a number between
09:03 - one and five now I am entering six now
09:05 - check the condition number less than
09:07 - equal to one no check second condition
09:11 - number greater than equal to 5 yes
09:13 - condition is true condition true again
09:15 - repeat this Loop again Ask enter a
09:17 - number between one and five now I am
09:19 - entering suppose two
09:21 - check the condition number less than
09:22 - equal to one no or number greater than
09:25 - equal to 5 no this condition is now
09:27 - false so you have entered correct number
09:29 - now out of the loop and it will print
09:31 - thanks one more thing like if you want
09:33 - to calculate area of something area of a
09:36 - square or area of rectangle then one
09:38 - time calculate area of rectangle right
09:41 - again it will ask do you want to
09:42 - calculate another don't to continue if
09:44 - you print yes calculate another area for
09:47 - another rectangle again it will ask yes
09:50 - or no so that thing you can put into
09:53 - while loop so that I will show you with
09:54 - the help of program
09:56 - so I guess now we will see practical we
09:59 - will run these programs on our laptop
10:00 - right and see this number I have
10:02 - declared out of this do I Loop out from
10:05 - this do I look from this body of the
10:08 - loop sorry out of this body of the loop
10:10 - why so because after closing this body
10:14 - we are using this number so we cannot do
10:18 - something like this after do within this
10:20 - we can declare into number
10:22 - not outside it will give error because
10:24 - outside of this body we are using this
10:27 - variable number so we have to declare
10:29 - this outside whatever variable you we
10:31 - will use for the condition you have to
10:33 - declare that variable out of this Loop
10:35 - of the body you have to take care of
10:36 - this thing right
10:38 - now let's do some practical okay let's
10:42 - create a new file for this do while loop
10:48 - do while
10:50 - underscore Loop
10:52 - dot CPP
10:54 - right
10:57 - so now
11:03 - first this header then we use using
11:08 - namespace STD
11:10 - then
11:12 - in Main
11:16 - I'm writing what it should be name space
11:21 - namespace STD then into Main
11:24 - first you will see the difference
11:25 - between while and do while loop so I am
11:27 - taking one variable and I is equal to 0
11:29 - then that example and then
11:32 - here
11:33 - what condition I need to put I greater
11:37 - than 0 okay and here in code we are just
11:42 - printing C out
11:45 - and we are printing just I Jenny that's
11:50 - it right
11:53 - with the ndl and after this
11:57 - let me just print
12:00 - out of flow just to indicate end of this
12:02 - Loop
12:03 - right
12:05 - then
12:07 - return 0
12:10 - okay let's run this and I will show you
12:13 - what output will get let me just zoom
12:15 - this
12:17 - I hope now you can see this
12:19 - right
12:21 - now
12:23 - let's run this
12:26 - it will ask so it will not ask anything
12:29 - it will just print high journey and out
12:32 - of loop right the condition is not true
12:34 - but still it is printing higher than you
12:36 - one time
12:37 - right now see I'm just making one
12:41 - difference here I'm just incrementing
12:43 - this value I plus plus
12:47 - within this body of the loop right now
12:50 - what output you will get
12:52 - see one time it will enter High then it
12:54 - will be printed now I plus plus means I
12:56 - becomes 1. now I greater than 0 yes it
12:59 - is true
12:59 - I is 1 again it will print I 2 3 4
13:04 - so what would be the output is it an
13:08 - infinite Loop or it will end somewhere
13:11 - how many times this higher Jenny would
13:13 - be printed if you have watched my
13:15 - previous video I guess you would be
13:17 - clear how this would run right so this
13:21 - is for your assignment you have to tell
13:22 - me in comment section what
13:25 - would be this output of this thing
13:28 - same if rather than do I Loop if you
13:31 - write down this code with while loop
13:32 - while first the condition then C out
13:35 - higher Jenny then it will print only out
13:37 - of the loop you have to try this at your
13:40 - own
13:40 - now let me just that program we will see
13:43 - see one more program you have to
13:46 - calculate suppose you want to calculate
13:48 - area of a rectangle so what we are
13:52 - taking
13:53 - first variable okay
13:56 - area of rectangle what I want first it
14:00 - will ask enter length and breadth right
14:02 - then it will calculate area it will
14:04 - print
14:06 - this is the area of rectangle right and
14:08 - after that you it will ask you do you
14:10 - want to continue do you want to
14:11 - calculate another
14:13 - if you enter yes again it will ask enter
14:17 - length in breadth if you rather than
14:20 - printing y
14:22 - small or capital Y any other character
14:26 - or one two three or n you will print it
14:29 - will exit from the loop
14:31 - right
14:33 - So within this see you just have to
14:35 - understand this thing rather than
14:37 - writing the program first understand
14:39 - what is the problem statement
14:42 - what would be the output what
14:45 - I want the output according to that you
14:47 - have to write down
14:50 - so at first it will run so at first
14:53 - obviously without checking the condition
14:55 - blue body would execute So within this
14:57 - Loop body what we can what we can take
15:01 - variable I am taking float float
15:04 - length and breadth better to write down
15:08 - length and breadth for better
15:09 - understanding I'm just writing lnv and
15:12 - area
15:13 - is equal to zero I am initializing it
15:15 - with 0 right
15:18 - now what
15:21 - C out
15:23 - it will ask enter
15:27 - length and
15:29 - breadth
15:32 - separated by a space
15:35 - okay
15:37 - now seeing
15:40 - L and B these variables we have taken
15:43 - now calculate area
15:47 - is equal to what
15:48 - length into breadth I guess simple this
15:51 - is the formula
15:54 - or correct me if I am wrong Ln to B
15:56 - after calculating area I am just
15:58 - printing area
16:02 - the area of rectangle you can write down
16:05 - of rectangle or simply you can have an
16:07 - area is
16:12 - and what is that variable area right
16:18 - after that it will ask
16:21 - C out
16:27 - one two
16:29 - calculate
16:31 - another or maybe you can write down do
16:34 - you want to continue
16:35 - so here
16:37 - you can either enter like yes or
16:41 - no you can enter anything but
16:46 - because you will just
16:48 - if yes then it will continue if you know
16:50 - then it will exit from the slope okay
16:53 - and now you will enter this thing yes or
16:57 - no y or n so obviously you have to store
16:59 - that this is input so you have to store
17:01 - that in a variable right
17:03 - so you have to take another variable
17:06 - Choice suppose I am taking choice
17:10 - character
17:12 - choice
17:13 - right
17:15 - so C in
17:17 - in Choice variable I am storing that
17:19 - input right
17:22 - now
17:24 - what we will do
17:27 - now here
17:29 - this condition what you will put see on
17:32 - Choice variable obviously we will put
17:34 - some condition
17:36 - choice would be the yes or no so on that
17:38 - only we will put some condition of
17:39 - choices yes we will continue choices no
17:41 - will not continue that is why on Choice
17:44 - variable we will put condition so that
17:46 - is why this Choice variable I have
17:47 - declared out of this Loop of the body
17:49 - right so now choice
17:53 - is equal to
17:57 - small y
17:59 - or
18:01 - logical or not and
18:07 - choice
18:09 - equal to
18:11 - capital Y
18:14 - is small wire capital Y this is the
18:16 - choice then we will continue
18:19 - right otherwise we will exit from this
18:21 - Loop
18:22 - right simple otherwise out of this loop
18:24 - I hope you got this this uh you know
18:27 - what you can say that logic of
18:29 - calculating area and if you want to
18:32 - continue that thing also how to add this
18:35 - kind of thing because in many programs
18:36 - you will see this thing do you want to
18:38 - continue yes or no or press one for this
18:40 - press 2 for this then do you want to
18:42 - continue at all this kind of problems so
18:44 - we will discuss in next video with the
18:45 - help of the while loop right this is
18:47 - just simple one so let's run this
18:51 - now it will ask enter length and breadth
18:53 - separated by a space so three and four
18:57 - enter the area is 12 okay now it will
19:01 - ask one to calculate another
19:03 - so I am just entering y
19:06 - again it will ask y means yes condition
19:08 - is true so it will continue
19:10 - so I am entering 4 5. 20 again do you
19:14 - want to continue
19:16 - this time I am entering capital Y
19:19 - okay it will ask again so 1 4. area is 4
19:24 - do you want to continue other than y
19:26 - capital Y and small y you will enter
19:29 - anything
19:30 - suppose I am entering better to enter
19:33 - and means no or if you enter anything
19:37 - right I am entering while sorry not y T
19:40 - then also it will exit C
19:45 - T then out of loop it will exit
19:49 - because the condition is only on y
19:53 - if you will enter Y and Y it will
19:55 - continue other than y if you enter
19:56 - anything 1 2 3 a b c d
20:00 - it will exit
20:01 - okay but you also put this condition
20:03 - also
20:06 - if you enter n Only n for exit or you
20:11 - can say Q for quit if you enter Q then
20:13 - only it will quit from the program if
20:15 - you enter any other thing why you will
20:18 - enter it will continue Q you will enter
20:20 - it will exit other than that you will
20:22 - enter anything it will you know show you
20:25 - invalid choice
20:27 - enter again
20:28 - okay this kind of thing this also you
20:30 - can Implement right
20:32 - these are some you know the this kind of
20:36 - thing you can do with this do I Loop
20:38 - this kind right like this you can write
20:40 - down if you remove this this thing from
20:43 - here it will give you an error right
20:45 - syntax error let me just run this and
20:47 - see
20:48 - at an expected the semicolon before c
20:51 - out so it is giving you an error right
20:55 - so that's it for this video now so I
20:58 - hope you got basics of do I Loop right
21:00 - now in the next video we'll just see two
21:02 - or three more programs on dou y Loop
21:04 - like in which type of different program
21:06 - so different uses of dou by Loop right
21:09 - with the help of program I will show you
21:10 - you can say that video will be more
21:12 - about coding exercise so now I'll see in
21:14 - the next video till then bye take care
