00:00 - hi guys welcome back in this video I'm
00:02 - going to discuss with you what is
00:03 - topological sorting or you can also say
00:06 - topological ordering fine what is the
00:08 - topological ordering and how to find out
00:10 - topological altering of a given graph
00:12 - fine so first of all we'll just discuss
00:15 - some key points of topological sorting
00:17 - what is topological sorting a
00:19 - topological ordering okay first point is
00:22 - to find out topological ordering that
00:25 - graph should be directed and acyclic
00:28 - that is the must condition graph should
00:32 - be dug that means directed and acyclic
00:41 - graph if graph is undirected you cannot
00:45 - find out topological sorting if graph is
00:47 - directed but it contains any cycle like
00:51 - this suppose we have 1 2 & 3 3 vertices
00:55 - this 1 2 2 3 & 3 to 1 1 to 2 2 to 3 and
01:00 - 3 to 1 the cycle is wrong now so such
01:03 - type of cycle contains if in graph then
01:06 - it is not possible to find out
01:07 - topological ordering of that graph so
01:09 - that graph should not contain any cycle
01:12 - not a single one fine that is must
01:14 - condition now what is topological
01:16 - sorting see topological sorting is
01:20 - basically a linear ordering linear
01:25 - ordering of the vertices in the graph
01:28 - such that for every directed edge UV so
01:34 - I see the edges from you to suppose u to
01:37 - V vertex u to V then in the or brain you
01:42 - must come before V fine I have written
01:48 - the definition here for vertex u 2 V u
01:51 - comes before vertex V in that ordering
01:55 - we will discuss it with the example then
01:57 - you will get it right and see one more
02:00 - point is for every dag if graph is
02:02 - directed in Si Si clique then at least
02:05 - one topological sorting would be there
02:07 - at least one but it is not compulsory
02:10 - that that graph will have only one
02:11 - topological sorting as
02:13 - Telegraph can have more than one
02:15 - topological sorting two three four five
02:17 - six fine any number of topological
02:19 - sorting now we'll discuss the method how
02:22 - to find out topological sorting okay
02:26 - discuss it with the help of one example
02:30 - now suppose this one is our graph see
02:34 - this is directed graph sorry this was
02:37 - directed acyclic graph or not first of
02:39 - all check it out this is directed yes
02:41 - every edge is having some direction is
02:43 - there any cycle directed cycle this this
02:47 - no this is not coming like that this
02:49 - no there is no cycle fine so topological
02:52 - sorting or topological ordering on this
02:54 - graph is possible now how to find out
02:57 - topological sorting the first step is
03:00 - very first step find out the in degree
03:05 - of each vertex in the directed graph we
03:08 - have the concept of in-degree and
03:09 - out-degree fine in degree means the
03:12 - number of edges coming to that word X
03:14 - and how degree means the number of edges
03:16 - outgoing from that vertex now find out
03:19 - in degree of every vertex indicative of
03:22 - this one is is there any edge which is
03:24 - coming to one no there are two edges
03:27 - which are outgoing from this one no I
03:29 - just coming so in degree of this one is
03:32 - zero in degree of this 2 is there is
03:35 - only one edge that is coming one in
03:39 - degree of this four is one and two edges
03:41 - are coming to four to this edges like
03:47 - this right in degree of this five is one
03:51 - in degree of three is two edges are
03:53 - coming to three one two now we have
03:57 - finally found out the in degree of every
04:00 - vertex by first step is this second step
04:04 - is you will start by writing down the
04:08 - topological ordering or you can say the
04:10 - linear or drain from the vertex having
04:13 - in degree 0 find you and choose that
04:17 - vertex first that is having in degree 0
04:20 - now find out which vertex is having in
04:23 - degree 0 1 so we will
04:26 - one okay
04:29 - now second step is we have selected this
04:34 - one fine
04:35 - so from this graph we will delete this
04:39 - one and all the edges which are outgoing
04:43 - from this one every edge so from this
04:47 - one how many edges are outgoing one into
04:51 - fine so we will delete this one and we
04:55 - will delete this this one also this one
05:00 - and this one now when we delete these
05:03 - edges then obviously the in degree of
05:06 - these vertices would be changed
05:09 - yes or no so the graph would be
05:12 - something like that we have only two we
05:16 - have four we have three we have fine
05:19 - fine two to four still we have four to
05:23 - three we have four to five we have this
05:27 - edge no we are not having one this edge
05:30 - we are not having this edge we have only
05:32 - two to three now in degree of this two
05:35 - will become what now you have to update
05:37 - the in degree of these vertices in
05:40 - degree of this two is now zero because
05:42 - first it was one this edge was deleted
05:45 - then it would be minus 1 1 minus 1 that
05:47 - is 0 it would be 2 - 1 - 1 edges had has
05:52 - been deleted now in degree of this 4s
05:54 - only this edge 1 5 is as it is 3 is in
05:59 - degrees - now we have this graph now
06:03 - again select the vertex having in degree
06:06 - 0 which one is having in degree 0 2 will
06:10 - write down to here next the same step we
06:14 - will delete this too.we will delete and
06:17 - will delete the every vertex out going
06:19 - from this to this also and this also
06:23 - fine and update the degree of these
06:26 - vertices you are supposed to update that
06:28 - what degree of those in degree of those
06:30 - vertices which are being affected
06:33 - because of because of deletion of this -
06:35 - and these edges now the graph would be
06:39 - is 2
06:39 - has been deleted now we have only three
06:41 - we have four we have five yes four to
06:45 - five we have four to five million four
06:47 - to three we have do we have this edge no
06:50 - two has been deleted do we have this no
06:52 - this has also been deleted we have only
06:54 - two edges now now in degree of three
06:56 - would become first of all it was 2 minus
06:59 - 1 that is 1 only for e 1 3 1 minus 1 is
07:04 - because this one has been deleted so in
07:06 - degree C you can see this there is no
07:08 - issue in coming to that vertex that is 0
07:11 - and here we have only one now again
07:15 - select the vertex having in degree 0 we
07:18 - have 4 write down this for the same step
07:23 - 4 would be deleted and also the outgoing
07:25 - edges would be deleted now the graph
07:28 - would be we have only vertex 3 and 5 now
07:32 - these two edges has been deleted is
07:34 - there any edge between these 3 and 5 no
07:37 - in degree of this 3 is now 0 in degree
07:40 - of this 5 is now zero now select again a
07:44 - vertex having in degree 0
07:46 - now see here we have 2 what this is
07:48 - having in degree 0 3 & 5 so you can take
07:52 - this 3 also and you can take 5
07:55 - suppose we are taking this three now
08:01 - three has been deleted now you can take
08:03 - this 5 or the second ordering is
08:06 - possible that is 1 2 4
08:09 - yata cassity's and after that first of
08:12 - all we will take this 5 and then we'll
08:14 - take this 3 so 2 topological ordering of
08:19 - topological ordering is possible off for
08:22 - this graph alright we'll take one more
08:26 - example suppose we have this kind of
08:32 - graph 1 2 3
08:42 - and 5c now find out the topological
08:48 - ordering of this graph see the
08:53 - topological ordering of this graphs
08:54 - you'll not be able to find out why so
08:57 - because this graph is having one
08:59 - directed cycle see this then this then
09:02 - this this is a cycle and we have already
09:06 - discussed in these properties that if a
09:08 - graph is having any cycle then you would
09:10 - not be able to find topological ordering
09:12 - for that graph so let us see is it
09:15 - possible is it true or not same step
09:18 - find out in degree of every vertex in
09:20 - degree of 1 is 1 in degree of this 2 is
09:23 - 2 1 & 2 2 edges are coming to that
09:26 - vertex 3 is 1 & 2 2 edges are coming for
09:31 - 5 in degree 0 for 4 in degree 0 select
09:35 - the vertex having in degree 0 you can
09:37 - select either 4 or 5 it's up to you
09:39 - suppose we are selecting for case 1 is
09:44 - this 4 or case to me you can select fine
09:47 - that's why I have told you for a graph
09:51 - directed acyclic graph many topological
09:53 - ordering are possible we are taking this
09:56 - case suppose we have choosen this for
09:59 - now after choosing this for delete this
10:01 - 4 and also this vertex now the graph
10:05 - would be 1 2 3 this one this one and
10:10 - this one now this one has been deleted
10:13 - but we have this 5 now in degree of this
10:17 - 5 is same in degree of 3 is still two in
10:20 - degree of 1 is still 1 but in degree of
10:22 - 2 is now 1 la too--they this has been
10:25 - deleted then 2 minus 1 that is 1 C 1
10:27 - edge now again select a vertex I mean
10:31 - degree 0 we have 5 suppose we have taken
10:33 - this 5 now delete this 5 and this edge
10:37 - now the graph would be 1 2 & 3 this one
10:44 - this one and this one now 5 has been
10:48 - deleted
10:48 - now put 8 the in degree of every vertex
10:50 - 1 1
10:53 - and still 2-1 deleted my one now is
10:57 - there any vertex having in degree zero
11:00 - no every vertex is having degree one one
11:02 - one so we cannot proceed further that is
11:06 - why I am saying if a graph contains a
11:09 - cycle then it would not be possible to
11:11 - find out topological ordering because if
11:13 - graph contains a cycle then at some
11:16 - point you will do it you will reach
11:18 - tonight some situations then at that
11:22 - time you will not have any vertex you
11:25 - will not find any vertex having in
11:26 - degree zero okay so that is the case you
11:32 - can take one more example suppose we are
11:36 - having this kind of graph now we are
11:37 - supposed to find out topological sorting
11:40 - of this graph find out first step in
11:42 - degree of every vertex in degree of is
11:44 - zero no I just coming in degree of D is
11:47 - one two three in degree of C is zero in
11:50 - degree of D is one to select a vertex
11:53 - having in degree zero you can select
11:54 - either C or you can select hey so case
11:58 - one is we have selected a and suppose
12:01 - case two we have selected C now
12:06 - case one we have selected a now after
12:09 - selection of a these would be deleted
12:12 - okay and the graph would be something
12:15 - like that we have B we have C we have D
12:19 - this one this one and this one and these
12:24 - edges has been related and update the in
12:28 - degree of every vertex sorry or you can
12:31 - see the update in degree of vertex which
12:32 - are being affected because of this
12:34 - deletion in degree of B now become 2 and
12:37 - B become 1 and C in degrees 0 now select
12:42 - a vertex having in degree 0 we have only
12:45 - C has been selected delayed this delayed
12:48 - this fine after deletion of Bees edges
12:52 - in degree of D would become 0 and in
12:55 - degree of B would become 1 then we would
12:58 - select in degree zero vertex having in
13:01 - degree 0 that is d after
13:04 - the selection of did this edge is also
13:06 - be deleted then we'll select right or
13:11 - the next case was suppose you have
13:14 - selected this C then delete this and
13:17 - this and the graph would be a b and b we
13:23 - are having this edge we are having this
13:25 - edge we are having this one update in
13:28 - degree this is having zero same this
13:31 - will be having to 3 minus 1 this will be
13:33 - having 1 now we will select a because in
13:38 - vertex a is having in degree 0
13:41 - now delete this this one and this one
13:43 - you have selected this a nor delete the
13:45 - outgoing edges of the say also and this
13:47 - vertex also now in degree of this would
13:50 - be updated to 0 after this deletion by
13:53 - an integral of this B would be updated
13:55 - to 1 now you can select after that you
14:00 - can select B and you can select now D so
14:03 - these are 2 topological ordering
14:05 - possible of this graph right so for
14:09 - every directed acyclic graph more than
14:11 - one topological ordering is possible
14:13 - okay I'll say in the next video
14:15 - till then bye bye take care
