00:00 - and the series of learning programming
00:01 - and see in the previous video I have
00:02 - discussed for loop everything about for
00:04 - Loop means the general syntax of for
00:07 - Loop what is meaning of how to use for
00:09 - Loop in your program uh the structure of
00:11 - for Loop the working of for loop with
00:13 - the help of flowchart as well as a
00:14 - program as well as you know the
00:16 - different ways we can write down for
00:17 - Loop and some you know some tricky
00:19 - things what type of tricky things you
00:21 - can do with for loop everything we have
00:23 - discussed in detail with help of program
00:26 - and I have shown you the output also
00:28 - right and this video I'll talk about a
00:31 - program means we are going to discuss a
00:33 - program using for Loop how you can write
00:35 - a program means how you can think a
00:37 - logic how you can think that here you
00:40 - have to use four Loop means here you
00:42 - have to use Loop because we have
00:44 - discussed only four Loop you can use
00:46 - while loop also do while loop also while
00:48 - writing this program but we have
00:49 - discussed for Loop only so I'll be uh
00:52 - making this program using for Loop so
00:54 - where and when you can use for Loop what
00:57 - condition you will put in that for Loop
00:58 - to terminate you will you are going to
01:00 - increment or decrement the value means
01:02 - everything means uh ultimately I want to
01:05 - explain how to use for Loop in your
01:07 - program right so now let's discuss a
01:10 - program to print table of a number see
01:14 - don't just think about the logic first
01:16 - of all first of all think about the
01:18 - output what kind of output you want
01:20 - according to that output you are going
01:22 - to write a program right so first think
01:24 - about the output see what I want I want
01:27 - to print table of a number number number
01:30 - suppose I want to ask from the user
01:31 - enter a number and suppose he's entering
01:33 - a number two and you have to print table
01:36 - of that two this kind of
01:42 - thing this kind of thing you want right
01:45 - this is table of two let us suppose
01:47 - number is two right so now here see 2
01:52 - into 1 and this number is the see
01:54 - increasing 1 2 3 4 5 up to 10 right this
01:58 - statement we are repeating again and
01:59 - again again right because two is the
02:02 - number the number is same at 10 places
02:06 - one number that is increasing from 1 to
02:08 - 10 and according to that we are
02:10 - multiplying the given number as well as
02:12 - this number this is suppose a variable
02:14 - whatever variable you will take I'm
02:16 - multiplying this and you are getting an
02:18 - output and that output you have to print
02:20 - right or maybe you can print all
02:23 - everything like 2 into 2 into 1 is equal
02:25 - to 2 all the data you can print or you
02:27 - can just print 2 4 6 like this but logic
02:29 - would be this thing you have to multiply
02:31 - the number with the one more uh number
02:34 - and that is increasing from 1 to 10 so
02:37 - what you can do you can here do what you
02:41 - we can use loops and the loop
02:44 - termination condition of the loop would
02:46 - be the loop would be started on this
02:48 - number on this variable I can put loop
02:50 - the loop would be started from one and
02:52 - that would be ended when the number
02:54 - becomes 10 because this number is same
02:58 - this is also this is only increasing
03:00 - so here I can put that
03:02 - increment condition right I ++ means
03:05 - suppose you take a variable I here this
03:07 - is I this is increasing from up to uh
03:10 - from 1 to 10 this is a number and here
03:13 - you are getting some output right so
03:16 - let's write down a
03:19 - program now to take input from the user
03:22 - means I want user should input a number
03:25 - you have to declare a variable because
03:26 - the data you can store in variable only
03:29 - right so I'm declaring a variable
03:31 - suppose int
03:33 - number and one is for the
03:37 - loop that is I suppose I'm taking two
03:40 - number two uh variables only now right
03:46 - now you will ask from the user enter a
03:49 - number right this message would be
03:52 - printed on your on that output screen
03:54 - and how you can take input using
03:58 - scanf I I hope you know the syntax of
04:00 - print F and scanf right now user has
04:03 - entered a number that is suppos two now
04:06 - you have to put four Loop in this case I
04:09 - would be initialized from one and the
04:12 - termination condition is I should be
04:14 - less than equal to 10 once I becomes 11
04:18 - this Loop would be terminated right and
04:21 - I would be incre we are going to
04:23 - increment I by 1 I + 1 right so I ++
04:27 - that is the loop in this Loop what you
04:30 - have to write you have to multiply the
04:33 - given number with this I right so I'm
04:37 - writing here this see like this number
04:40 - into I but whatever the multiplication
04:43 - whatever the result that also we are
04:46 - going to store somewhere and for that
04:47 - also you need a variable it's not like
04:50 - that you can only multiply what value
04:52 - would be stored where the value would be
04:54 - stored how in see in programs in
04:57 - computer you have to use some variable
04:59 - to store
05:00 - uh that any number into memory so here
05:04 - and how the value would be assigned
05:06 - first of all this would be calculated
05:08 - and this this result will be assigned to
05:10 - another variable right so I'm taking
05:13 - suppose variable here a you can take any
05:16 - variable name so before using this we
05:18 - have to declare a
05:20 - here right that is why I'm taking three
05:23 - variable I hope now you go why you are
05:25 - taking three variables and I hope in any
05:27 - program you can identify how many
05:29 - variables you have to declare right now
05:31 - A is equal to number into I fine
05:35 - and I am printing because 10 times I
05:38 - have to print so print F this statement
05:40 - would be executed 10 times that is why
05:42 - I'm writing this statement in loop it's
05:44 - not like that just do this thing and
05:46 - write print f after this for Loop no
05:49 - then the print F would be executed only
05:50 - once and I want what 10 times print F
05:54 - should be
05:54 - executed right to print a table of a
05:57 - number so now how you can print
05:59 - percentage
06:00 - D and simply output would be in a right
06:06 - so a you can print fine and that's it
06:10 - now see when you run this program then
06:13 - let us try run this program first of all
06:15 - control will go to the first line of the
06:17 - main three variables would be you know
06:20 - assigned some memory locations number
06:23 - one is I and one is a having some memory
06:28 - address but in this number we are we are
06:30 - not having we don't have anything we are
06:31 - not initializing these numbers here then
06:33 - on output screen what output you will
06:35 - get enter a number this thing would be
06:38 - printed when you will run this
06:40 - program and suppose you are in pring
06:42 - number two now control will go here in
06:45 - for loop I is equal to 1 right now I
06:48 - value is 1 I'm initializing I here I
06:51 - less than equal to 10 yes it is true
06:53 - control will enter into this for Loop
06:55 - right now it is going to fetch the
06:58 - number from the memory in number c I
07:00 - have entered what two so when whenever
07:02 - you will enter two that would be stored
07:03 - in this number right address of number
07:06 - number variable fine now 2 into I 2 into
07:11 - 1 that is 2 and that would be stored in
07:14 - a that is two would be stored here right
07:18 - next statement is print F percentage d
07:20 - means it has to print integer value now
07:23 - next it will take it will see the
07:25 - argument a whatever the value of a it
07:27 - will print that is two would be printed
07:29 - here
07:30 - right now before exiting the loop next
07:33 - is what it will do what I ++ see the
07:36 - working of four Loop if you haven't
07:38 - checked my previous video you can check
07:39 - out in the side button I ++ now I
07:42 - becomes two check the condition it is
07:45 - true again it will enter here number
07:47 - into I number 2 into two that is four
07:50 - now four would be stored in a and now
07:52 - print F four would be printed see here
07:55 - you are not we are not using any slash
07:57 - and so four would be printed here but I
07:59 - want to print a table something like
08:01 - this not horizontal vertical so what you
08:04 - can do you can put slash in here that is
08:06 - slash is for new line so now four will
08:08 - be printed here again I ++ I becomes
08:11 - three condition is true 3 into 2 that is
08:15 - six would be stored in a and six would
08:18 - be printed here right like this this
08:20 - would be in Loop and up to 10 this would
08:24 - be printed at one
08:26 - time this value of I becomes 10 this is
08:30 - 2 and here 20 not 10 20 would be printed
08:35 - now again it becomes I ++ that is I
08:37 - value becomes 11 now the condition is
08:39 - not true so it will not enter into this
08:42 - for Loop it will go out of the for Loop
08:45 - and we have get CH whenever you will
08:47 - press any or when whenever you will
08:48 - press enter you will get back to your
08:50 - editor screen so this is how you can
08:52 - print a table of a number right now I
08:55 - hope you got the working of this for
08:56 - Loop and I hope now you can write down
08:58 - any program you can use any for Loop you
09:00 - can identify the termination condition
09:02 - for the for Loop right and the
09:04 - initialization also and this also like
09:06 - you have to do I ++ or iusus I guess by
09:10 - seeing the output means first of all
09:12 - analyze the output according to that
09:13 - write down a program now I want the
09:16 - output should be printed something like
09:18 - this 2 into 1 is = 2 2 into 2 isal 4
09:21 - this like this 2 into uh 10 is equal to
09:24 - 20 how you can print this kind of output
09:28 - please write down a PR prr or you can
09:30 - copy paste that program or just any
09:33 - simple line where you have to change
09:35 - only that line you can print you can
09:37 - write down in the comment box that's it
09:39 - for me no no need to write down the
09:40 - complete program right so now I hope
09:42 - that's it for this video now we we will
09:46 - discuss many programs about for Loop
09:48 - like printing a pattern or factorial Fab
09:51 - series many programs but that I think
09:53 - I'll discuss on that ID not on this
09:56 - whiteboard yeah I'll explain the logic
09:58 - on but I'll show you the run that that
10:01 - program the execution of that program on
10:03 - that ID from the next video fine so now
10:06 - I'll see you in the next video till then
10:08 - bye-bye take
10:12 - care
