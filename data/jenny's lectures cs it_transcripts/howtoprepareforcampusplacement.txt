00:00 - hey everyone from today onwards I'm
00:02 - going to start a new series regarding
00:04 - placements because I was getting many
00:06 - requests to upload videos regarding
00:08 - interview tips regarding campus
00:11 - placement and all how to prepare for you
00:13 - know getting a placement and internship
00:15 - and all that so I'm going to start a
00:17 - series on this topic now today it's the
00:20 - first video it's not like that I will
00:22 - cover all the topics all the I mean
00:24 - important tips and tricks all the
00:27 - preparation strategies in one video only
00:30 - this is just an introductory and
00:32 - overview video later on if I'll get your
00:35 - love and support for this video then
00:37 - definitely I am going to cover all the
00:39 - topics in this C's right right so I'll
00:43 - cover all the you know important topics
00:46 - and tricks and tips regarding
00:48 - interviewing placements one by one in
00:50 - later videos right in this video I'm
00:52 - going to tell you I'm going to give you
00:55 - an overview of hub to prepare for campus
00:58 - placement or college placements
00:59 - obviously you are maybe in third year or
01:01 - final year and you are preparing for
01:03 - your placements right so how to prepare
01:05 - for that fine now
01:08 - see maybe you are in some good colleges
01:12 - like in tier one college societies and
01:15 - maybe someone are triple I tease and NIT
01:18 - s some are in Normal University some are
01:21 - in good private universities right some
01:23 - are in normal colleges so it depends you
01:27 - are in which college because you know in
01:30 - Tier one type of colleges product based
01:33 - companies usually come for campus
01:35 - placement right so that is benefit for
01:37 - you and in normal colleges and you know
01:41 - obviously some good University is also
01:43 - some service based companies mostly
01:45 - comes product based companies don't
01:48 - prefer to coming those colleges right
01:51 - but still if you are in these kind of
01:54 - colleges in private universities or some
01:56 - good private colleges then also you can
01:59 - apply for foreign aid based companies
02:01 - I'm going to cover all these topics one
02:03 - by one in this placement series how you
02:05 - can apply for product based companies
02:07 - right now see
02:11 - when company will come to you know you
02:13 - are college for conducting the interview
02:15 - then obviously there will be some
02:16 - grounds right and in product based
02:20 - companies there are more rounds then in
02:23 - surface based companies in term right so
02:26 - generally I am going to talk about the
02:28 - rounds in this video general rounds so
02:31 - first one obviously that is aptitude
02:34 - around you know aptitude test this is
02:37 - basically just to filter out the
02:38 - students just to filter out the crowd
02:40 - right it's not very tough it's not like
02:44 - that you are preparing for some you know
02:46 - banking clerk or Pio type of you know
02:50 - exam and you have to prepare very well
02:52 - and you are just focusing on aptitude
02:54 - and reasoning a lot no it's very simple
02:57 - it's not me you know like that tough
03:00 - type of questions would be there simply
03:02 - 10 to 15 or 20 days or one month
03:05 - preparation would be enough obviously
03:07 - I'm going to you know make a series on
03:10 - this also each round I will discuss in
03:13 - detail in later videos right so after so
03:18 - after this round generally we have
03:21 - gd-rom group discussion it depends may
03:25 - be in some companies it is not there may
03:28 - be the interview after the Sapta to
03:30 - drown directly you will go to the
03:32 - technical interview technical round and
03:34 - in some companies it is there that is
03:36 - group discussion so in this round
03:37 - they'll see your communication skill how
03:40 - confident you are how confidently you
03:42 - can express your thought right how
03:45 - confident you are going to speak fine
03:48 - so we will discuss all the points about
03:52 - this round group discussion round also
03:55 - in detail I will discuss this in later
03:57 - videos right the suggestion overview
04:00 - general over fine after that it comes to
04:03 - technical round mostly in technical
04:06 - round maybe some companies will will
04:09 - give you a proper coding round like two
04:11 - or three hours they will give you and
04:13 - maybe they'll give you two or three
04:14 - questions and you will have to solve
04:15 - those questions fine and maybe just a
04:19 - interview type of technical round means
04:21 - they'll take the interview in that
04:24 - to review only they'll ask the questions
04:27 - regarding coding then just give you a
04:29 - simple situation and you are supposed to
04:32 - you know write down the code for that
04:34 - situation you are just supposed to write
04:36 - down the logic fine it depends like on
04:40 - company to company which type of company
04:42 - is visiting to your college fine so now
04:46 - basically in this round what did they
04:48 - check they'll check your core subject
04:51 - knowledge and mainly they'll focus on
04:54 - data structure and algorithm concepts
04:57 - you should be very clear you should be
04:59 - very sound in your DSA concepts and you
05:03 - should be able to implement your
05:05 - concepts you should be able to you know
05:07 - apply the logic if they'll give you a
05:09 - particular situation particular problem
05:11 - you can apply the logic you should be a
05:14 - critical thinker right like which data
05:16 - structure you need to use in that case
05:19 - which type of logic which type of
05:21 - approach you are going to follow you
05:24 - have to keep in mind the time and space
05:26 - complexity also your code should be
05:27 - optimized right so the only solution is
05:31 - what practice you need to practice the
05:34 - coding questions there are many
05:36 - platforms and one of the good platform
05:39 - is to you know practice these type of
05:42 - question that is called saga so you can
05:45 - go to code saga dot IO website and there
05:48 - he they they'll give you the ultimate
05:50 - resources to practice for your interview
05:53 - coding interview questions right there
05:56 - you'll get many hint big coding
05:59 - interview questions there you will get a
06:01 - video explanation of each questions you
06:03 - will get a technical assistant support
06:06 - of technical assistant right there he
06:08 - also you will get some videos to revise
06:11 - your data structure concepts all these
06:13 - points I'm going to show you in detail
06:14 - right there you will get many questions
06:18 - based on the important topics of data
06:20 - structure like dynamic programming link
06:22 - lists at a recursion and all right so
06:24 - now I'm going to show you how you can
06:26 - practice these type of questions right
06:29 - you can select any questions I'm going
06:31 - to select a sample question here right
06:33 - you just read out the problem properly
06:37 - fine
06:38 - and after that you can write down your
06:40 - own code whether in C++ you want to
06:43 - write down in Java and Python it's up to
06:45 - you you can write down your own code you
06:47 - can run your own code and if you are
06:49 - stuck somewhere then you can check the
06:53 - hints you can click on show and there
06:56 - you will get multiple hints and also you
06:58 - will get the knowledge about optimized
07:01 - time and space complexity analysis of
07:03 - that problem here fine and here you will
07:07 - find out the output of your problem
07:09 - still if you are stuck in that problem
07:12 - after using the hints you are not able
07:14 - to solve that problem
07:16 - you can you can check the video
07:19 - explanation of that question Lots here
07:22 - fine you can get the theoretical
07:25 - explanation for that question how you
07:26 - are going to solve that after a
07:29 - theoretical explanation you can also
07:31 - check the industry exports and the
07:39 - question is properly explained right if
07:42 - you are still not able to solve this
07:44 - question then you can also get help from
07:47 - your dedicated technical assistant
07:52 - they'll provide you a technical
07:54 - assistant and you can get help from that
07:56 - technical assistance fine
07:58 - and here you will get the solution of
08:00 - that question in three languages in C++
08:02 - in Java and Python and you can write
08:04 - down your own code also in either in C++
08:07 - Java or Python it's up to you fine again
08:09 - you can go to a question list you can
08:11 - select a question you can repeat the
08:13 - same process fine now for this you have
08:17 - to subscribe there package basically
08:20 - they have introduced two packages one is
08:22 - basic and one is pro so in basic you
08:25 - will get access to code saga for six
08:27 - months and an employee will get for one
08:29 - year and there you will get 100
08:31 - hand-picked coding interview questions
08:33 - and these questions are very good fine
08:35 - there you will get video explanation of
08:37 - each question by industry experts you
08:39 - will get a proper course on data
08:41 - structure you will revise your concepts
08:43 - here in pro you have some extra you know
08:46 - benefits like you can you resume it
08:49 - reviewed by the experts who are already
08:53 - you know good job
08:55 - fine plus in pro you will get the
08:58 - technical assistant help a dedicated
09:00 - technical assistant would be there for
09:02 - you and you can get your you know your
09:04 - doubt resolution with the help of that
09:07 - technical assistant right so you can go
09:10 - for this I'll provide you the link of
09:12 - this one in my description box you can
09:15 - check out there and there is a code
09:18 - Jenny 10 you can see you on the screen
09:22 - if you apply this code you will get 10%
09:24 - discount on these packages right so I
09:28 - think this would be a very good who are
09:30 - preparing for interviews and I think
09:32 - it's worth to pay for it right because
09:34 - it's a very good platform so you can go
09:36 - for it you can check out all the details
09:38 - in my description box right now for
09:41 - implementation of these concepts
09:43 - obviously you should have be very good
09:45 - in any one of the programming language
09:47 - like you can say C++ or Java or Python
09:50 - it's up to you it's not like that you
09:53 - are supposed to be very good in all the
09:55 - languages so you need not to be worried
09:58 - you need to be very good in at least one
10:01 - language either it's C++ Java or Python
10:04 - so that you can implement your logic
10:07 - right so it depends maybe which company
10:11 - is visiting your college you you can
10:13 - check the background of that company in
10:15 - which technology and which language that
10:17 - company is working so you can go for
10:19 - that language or at least one language
10:22 - you should read thoroughly you should be
10:24 - very good in at least one language right
10:28 - now obviously question would be there
10:30 - which language is good so that also will
10:33 - discuss in the series one by one all the
10:35 - topics I am going to cover fine this is
10:38 - just an introductory video now other
10:41 - than this one obviously you should be
10:43 - good in some other subjects like DBMS
10:49 - operating system and computer network
10:56 - mostly these subjects and sometimes it's
11:00 - not like that you should be very good in
11:02 - all the
11:03 - concepts like link list very trees and
11:05 - all dynamic programming and all fine
11:08 - sometimes they'll ask you you are
11:11 - comfortable in which topic so at least
11:14 - prepare one or two topics so that you
11:17 - can you can solve all the problems maybe
11:20 - you say like you are comfortable him in
11:22 - linked list so they will give you
11:23 - problem on linked list so you should be
11:25 - able to solve that problem right
11:28 - maybe they last soon which subject you
11:31 - are comfortable maybe you can call from
11:34 - these you can call OS so you should be
11:36 - very good in that subject so at least
11:40 - try to you know be very good in one
11:43 - subject fine and in some BSA concepts if
11:47 - you are not able to read out all the
11:50 - concepts of BSA if you are not so strong
11:52 - your programming programming is not so
11:54 - strong so at least try to you know go
11:57 - through at least two or three topics
11:59 - thoroughly and another most important
12:02 - point in this is what sometimes your
12:05 - exact solution doesn't matter here they
12:07 - just want to see your approach which
12:11 - type of approach you are following to
12:12 - solve the questions your speed right
12:16 - then see if you you are you are aware
12:20 - about the time and space complexity also
12:23 - if your code is optimized or not right
12:26 - so do not focus that if your code is not
12:29 - exact if you haven't you know a properly
12:32 - get the output then oh my god I will not
12:35 - be selected it's not like that just
12:38 - focus on your approach just try to
12:39 - optimize your code just try to think
12:42 - loud right explain as much as you can to
12:46 - the interviewer so try to communicate
12:48 - with the interviewer when solving the
12:50 - problem sometimes they'll give you the
12:53 - hints right so try to communicate with
12:55 - the interviewer also fine after this
12:59 - round generally we have HR round and
13:01 - sometimes after clearing all the rounds
13:04 - some candidates got rejected in this
13:07 - round also so it's not like that you
13:09 - will take it so easy right although it's
13:12 - not very tough you have to be yourself
13:16 - you have to be confident fine just you
13:19 - know read out the company before going
13:21 - to this round their background and all
13:24 - they last you many type of question in
13:26 - this H around like about yourself where
13:31 - do you see yourself three years from now
13:34 - or five years from now your strengths
13:36 - your weaknesses and old many type of
13:37 - question they can ask units around fine
13:40 - so definitely we will discuss each and
13:43 - every round in detail this round also in
13:45 - detail in later videos fine and I have
13:49 - already told you number of rounds
13:50 - depends on company to company right
13:53 - maybe personal interview would be
13:55 - another round and this coding and coding
13:59 - round would be another round in some
14:00 - type of companies it depends so I think
14:03 - that's it for this introductory video
14:06 - for this placement series now in this
14:09 - series you can tell me in the comment
14:11 - box which type of video you won't like
14:12 - maybe how to get into product based
14:14 - company subservience wants to know some
14:16 - interview tips some important tips five
14:19 - four five three important tips regarding
14:22 - interviewer regarding placements fine
14:24 - many types of videos can be there you
14:26 - can tell me in the comment box so if I
14:29 - get you your love and support on this
14:31 - video definitely I am going to continue
14:33 - the series right so now it's in the next
14:36 - video to learn more by tech
