00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:01 - programming we are discussing stories
00:03 - class concept in c in the previous video
00:05 - we have discussed what is a storage
00:06 - class why we need storage class what
00:08 - storage class tells about a variable you
00:11 - can say what is the significance of a
00:12 - storage class
00:14 - right
00:15 - or you can see that video was about you
00:16 - can say the introduction of stories
00:18 - class the basic points so i would
00:20 - recommend you go to that video first
00:21 - then come to this video now i have told
00:24 - you there are four type of storage
00:25 - classes automatic register extern
00:28 - external and static right one by one we
00:31 - are going to discuss all the types of
00:32 - stories classes in this video we will
00:34 - talk about auto stories class
00:36 - everything about this storage class you
00:38 - know all this you know every single
00:41 - point all the important points also i'm
00:43 - going to tell you with the help of a
00:45 - program practical also i'll show you how
00:47 - to use this auto storage class in your
00:49 - program right
00:51 - so that also i'll show you on my laptop
00:53 - right now before that just want to tell
00:54 - you one thing as promised in the last
00:57 - video i am here with information on the

02:13 - right now the date is from 5th april to
02:15 - 11th april the registration link i'll
02:17 - put in the description box of this video
02:19 - you can go and check out now let's
02:21 - discuss types of stories classes
02:24 - i hope now you are aware about what is
02:26 - the story is class see
02:28 - let me just brief you first whenever we
02:30 - declare a variable like i write int x
02:33 - is equal to 10. so this is data type
02:36 - this is name of the variable right and
02:38 - this is what value of the variable so
02:40 - this thing will tell this data type will
02:43 - tell what kind of value you can store
02:44 - integer value we can store
02:46 - but some other information are also also
02:48 - there associated with this variable
02:50 - right like default value if we are not
02:52 - going to initialize this what would be
02:54 - the default value second one the scope
02:56 - of this variable where we can use scope
02:58 - we have discussed
02:59 - three scope uh one is you can say
03:02 - one is program ah second was function or
03:06 - method scope and one was
03:09 - block
03:10 - these scope we have discussed in the
03:11 - previous video right so what is the
03:13 - scope this variable the lifetime of this
03:15 - variable right and where this variable
03:17 - would be store the location so these
03:19 - things would be told
03:21 - by
03:22 - storage classes
03:24 - right storage classes are also so
03:26 - associated with this variable data type
03:28 - plus storage class two things so types
03:32 - of storage classes are there
03:34 - four types
03:37 - automatic
03:41 - register
03:43 - static
03:45 - and external these four types of storage
03:47 - classes are there and what storage class
03:49 - will tell about this variable
03:52 - default scope
03:54 - sorry default value
03:56 - the scope of the variable location
03:59 - where this variable would be stored in
04:01 - the memory or maybe in the register or
04:02 - in the main memory where
04:04 - and
04:05 - lifetime
04:06 - these four things storage class will
04:08 - take so for
04:10 - these storage classes
04:12 - these things would be different suppose
04:14 - with this variable i am using
04:17 - auto the storage class so for this
04:19 - storage class
04:20 - these four values would be different
04:22 - if i use register
04:24 - how to use storage classes with these
04:26 - variables you just have to write down
04:28 - here
04:30 - right like first storage class is
04:33 - automatic
04:36 - so what keyword we use auto
04:40 - so just use here auto
04:43 - now it means this variable the storage
04:46 - class of this variable is photo now
04:48 - according to this storage class default
04:50 - value of this variable would be what
04:52 - garbage value
04:54 - default value would be for this storage
04:56 - class we are talking about
04:58 - automatic first one automatic auto
05:00 - storage class so the default value would
05:02 - be
05:03 - garbage value these points are very
05:05 - important you just note down these
05:06 - points
05:07 - right now scope is what where you can
05:11 - access this variable where
05:13 - now scope is program one uh sorry
05:15 - function and math function or method or
05:17 - block
05:18 - so the scope of this variable uh the
05:20 - auto storage class is what either it can
05:24 - be
05:24 - a blog or a function
05:28 - right
05:29 - like i'm writing a program something
05:31 - like this
05:33 - so first me just write down scope would
05:36 - be you can say block
05:39 - or
05:40 - it can be
05:41 - function spoke
05:45 - right like how you can use
05:50 - see in main obviously main is a function
05:51 - so here i can declare auto like i am
05:54 - declaring int x
05:56 - is equal to 10
05:58 - right
05:59 - so this scope is within this function
06:01 - main function
06:02 - right here we can access this
06:04 - we are declaring another block this is
06:07 - what
06:08 - anything which will written here that
06:09 - would be considered as a block so here
06:11 - suppose i am again
06:14 - declaring a variable in x and value is
06:17 - nothing
06:20 - right so this x now this auto this x is
06:22 - having scope block scope and this this x
06:26 - is having function scope
06:28 - right
06:29 - but
06:30 - this auto this storage class cannot have
06:32 - scope program scope means global program
06:35 - means global
06:37 - you know
06:38 - till the end of the program we can use
06:40 - so this is what you can say local
06:41 - variables
06:42 - only local scope this photo can have the
06:45 - storage class can have we cannot declare
06:48 - something like this auto
06:50 - in
06:51 - x is equal to 30
06:53 - outside of the main function means this
06:55 - would be global variable right and this
06:58 - variable have program scope so this is
07:00 - not allowed when we are using auto
07:02 - storage class this will give error
07:06 - only these scopes are allowed function
07:08 - so for block scope
07:10 - i hope this is clear to you only here we
07:12 - can use
07:13 - if you will print here printf
07:16 - percentage d
07:18 - x and after this block also i am going
07:20 - to print printf
07:23 - percentage d and x
07:26 - so this x value what would be printed
07:29 - we haven't initialized this x
07:31 - right so if you don't initialize the the
07:34 - default value would be garbage value so
07:36 - it will print any garbage value
07:39 - garbage value
07:40 - now after this block
07:42 - obviously this would be destroyed we
07:44 - cannot access the lifetime of this
07:45 - excess
07:46 - within the block so the lifetime would
07:48 - be
07:50 - within the block
07:52 - or you can say till the end of the block
07:54 - we can access the variable variable the
07:56 - auto variable after that we cannot
07:59 - the same as local variable
08:01 - right we have discussed previous also
08:03 - local variable global variable
08:05 - fine this i am just telling you in the
08:07 - terms of storage class
08:09 - right so now the lifetime of this x is
08:11 - within this block after that we cannot
08:13 - access this x so for this x what value
08:16 - would be printed
08:18 - this x is what will access
08:20 - this x the value is 10
08:22 - in this main function we have
08:24 - x value 10 so it will print 10
08:27 - right
08:28 - now location is what
08:30 - where this would be stored
08:32 - in main memory
08:34 - right
08:35 - now why i am saying this this would be
08:36 - stored in your you can say stack
08:39 - right i hope you remember that
08:42 - date you can say memory layout we have
08:45 - discussed in the video memory layout of
08:46 - the application for one some i know is
08:49 - for code or instruction
08:52 - we have stack
08:53 - sorry
08:54 - for static
08:56 - and global variable
08:58 - one section is stack one section is e
09:02 - right
09:03 - so that's the location of this this
09:05 - variable would be stored in stack
09:07 - fragment
09:08 - right why i am saying this because maybe
09:10 - you will say all the local variables
09:11 - would be stored in
09:13 - stack
09:14 - yes but there is static variables global
09:17 - variables section is different resistor
09:20 - if we have if you are using storage
09:22 - class register those variables would be
09:25 - stored in the cpu registers that will
09:27 - discuss in the next video
09:29 - all the points about register storage
09:31 - class right so now i think default value
09:34 - is clear to you scope is clear to you
09:36 - and if you will use this thing this
09:38 - would give error location is clear to
09:39 - you lifetime of this storage class is
09:42 - clear to you right now let me show you
09:44 - practically let me show you practically
09:45 - whether it is giving any error or not
09:48 - you will see this program also on our
09:50 - laptop so i hope all the points about
09:53 - this auto storage class is clear to you
09:54 - guys and by default if you will not use
09:57 - anything
09:58 - i'm just
09:59 - using in text so by default
10:02 - with storage class would be considered
10:04 - with this
10:05 - o2
10:07 - by default
10:09 - right
10:10 - so let me create a new file
10:14 - auto dot c and
10:20 - header file and then
10:23 - in main
10:24 - we'll take
10:27 - one variable auto and x is equal to 10
10:31 - right then one
10:34 - more
10:35 - or two and x is equal to 20
10:39 - and
10:40 - we are just printing here printf
10:44 - this x value
10:45 - right
10:50 - x is equal to
10:52 - and just printing x
10:55 - and after this
10:56 - block also we are
10:58 - printing the value print f
11:00 - percentage d
11:02 - so i should use like slash n and x is
11:06 - equal to
11:08 - and then x
11:10 - right
11:14 - so now
11:15 - see
11:16 - this x is having
11:18 - block scope this one and this x is
11:20 - having function scope
11:22 - main is a function or maybe a method
11:24 - scope now let me just run this and show
11:27 - you what output you will get here
11:31 - for this x it will print 20
11:34 - right and for this x it will print 10 so
11:37 - x is 10 ah sorry first is 20 then 10 and
11:40 - now if we will not initialize this thing
11:44 - then what you will get default value for
11:46 - this auto storage class is what car base
11:48 - value so you are getting x is equal to
11:50 - 43 any value garbage value and for this
11:53 - x you are getting 10
11:54 - right
11:55 - now
11:58 - see if i declare here auto and x is
12:01 - equal to 89
12:04 - globally
12:05 - program scope
12:07 - let me just run this and show you
12:09 - whether it's allowed or not c error it
12:11 - will give error file scope declaration
12:13 - of x specifies auto so it is not allowed
12:15 - right
12:16 - only two scopes are allowed you can say
12:18 - block scope is allowed block or method
12:20 - scope right no program scope is allowed
12:22 - for auto storage class i hope now this
12:24 - is clear to you right and lifetime is
12:27 - also clear to you you can access within
12:28 - the block only see this x we can access
12:30 - within this block only
12:32 - if we are using the value x is equal to
12:34 - here 20 so this value would be
12:36 - accessible within this
12:38 - ah you know with help of the sprint f
12:40 - only with this printf statement within
12:42 - this block only right
12:44 - after this block this x will be vanished
12:46 - the 20 value would be vanished
12:49 - right so lifetime is within the
12:51 - block only right and the storage is
12:53 - where you can store in the memory main
12:55 - memory you can see the stack fragment of
12:56 - the memory right default value is
12:59 - garbage value i have shown you the scope
13:01 - also i have shown you so this is about
13:02 - auto storage class
13:04 - so in the next video we will see
13:05 - register stories glass and i'll see the
13:07 - next video till then bye take care
