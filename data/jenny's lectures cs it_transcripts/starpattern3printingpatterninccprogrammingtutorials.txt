00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:01 - c we are discussing
00:03 - about what printing pattern programs and
00:05 - see how to print
00:06 - these kind of patterns we already
00:07 - discussed three printing pattern
00:09 - programs so now in this video
00:11 - i'll talk about how to print this
00:12 - pattern first of all we'll see the logic
00:14 - on this whiteboard then
00:16 - i'll show you the output on my laptop
00:17 - using base code editor
00:19 - right please check out the previous
00:21 - videos first then you will get it better
00:23 - so now here i am taking number of rows 5
00:26 - but we'll
00:26 - also discuss if user wants to enter
00:29 - number of rows 5
00:30 - 10 15 20 then how you will uh
00:33 - run this that code so here number of
00:35 - rows five
00:37 - right two loops would be required first
00:39 - is
00:40 - for these number of lines or you can say
00:42 - number of rows
00:43 - like first loop is we will take variable
00:46 - i
00:47 - so when i is 1 for this row i am just
00:51 - you know for a better understanding i am
00:53 - just
00:55 - writing down like this c
01:00 - number of rows i is 1 for this row then
01:02 - 2 then 3 then 4 then 5
01:05 - right and for these columns
01:08 - we have one variable that is j
01:12 - which is responsible which is for inner
01:14 - loop and which is responsible for actual
01:16 - printing
01:18 - j is equal to 1 here 2 3 4 and 5
01:22 - like this right i hope you got it why
01:24 - i'm writing like this
01:26 - so now in the previous patterns we
01:29 - we are printing we are printing only
01:32 - this s
01:32 - trick or you can say star right but here
01:36 - in this one we have to print two things
01:40 - space as well as star
01:43 - it's not like that here also you can
01:45 - print star
01:47 - first of all we have to print space like
01:49 - in this line
01:50 - first of all four space then star in
01:53 - second line three space
01:54 - two star in third line two space three
01:57 - star
01:58 - like this we are printing and in the
02:00 - last line all the lines we are printing
02:03 - what star no space
02:05 - plus slash and three things you have to
02:08 - put in this program
02:09 - space the star plus slash and for
02:13 - new line i have five line right
02:16 - so now slash and we are putting an outer
02:19 - loop in
02:20 - inner loop what you have to put some
02:22 - condition
02:23 - right when you want to print space when
02:26 - you want to print star
02:28 - so in inner loop we have to put some
02:30 - condition now you have to
02:32 - think about that condition this is main
02:34 - thing in these printing
02:36 - pattern programs if you are able to
02:37 - figure out what condition you put
02:40 - that's it right the control is in your
02:44 - head
02:46 - after that so how to find out that
02:48 - condition
02:49 - see now think about it for this
02:52 - space for this location or you can say
02:55 - cell high value is 1
02:57 - j value is also 1 for this i value is 1
03:01 - j value is 2 for this 1 1 for this
03:04 - high value is 1 j value is 3 like this 1
03:07 - and 4
03:08 - for this i value is 2 j value is 1 for
03:11 - this
03:11 - it's 2 2 for this it's 2 3 3 1
03:15 - 3 2 4 1 4 2 4 3 like this
03:19 - it's 5 1 5 2 5 3 in these
03:23 - locations you have to print space
03:25 - otherwise star
03:26 - so what condition we can put c please
03:29 - think about it
03:31 - if i put like this i plus
03:35 - j less than
03:38 - equal to 5
03:42 - in that case print space otherwise print
03:46 - start
03:48 - see now why i am saying this i plus j
03:51 - for this
03:52 - cell i plus j is what i is 1 j is 1 so 1
03:55 - plus 1 that is 2
03:57 - 2 less than equal to 5 number of rows
03:59 - are 5 total number of rows
04:02 - 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition
04:03 - trim print
04:05 - space 2 plus 1 3 3 is less than equal to
04:09 - 5
04:09 - yes print space 3 plus 1 4 4 is less
04:12 - than
04:14 - equal to five yes print space
04:18 - four plus one five five less than equal
04:21 - to five
04:22 - yes five is equal to five print space
04:25 - now for this cell value is what i value
04:28 - is one j value is five
04:29 - one plus five that is six is this
04:32 - condition true six less than equal to
04:34 - five
04:35 - no now print star
04:40 - let's check this condition is true or
04:41 - not for the second
04:43 - row two plus one three condition true
04:46 - print space
04:47 - two plus two four condition two print
04:49 - space
04:50 - three plus two five five less than equal
04:52 - to five condition true print space
04:55 - 2 plus 4 that is 6 condition not true
04:58 - print star 2 plus 5 7 condition not true
05:02 - print star
05:04 - i hope you are getting my point so we
05:07 - can generalize
05:09 - this would be the condition generally we
05:12 - can put this condition
05:13 - here i have 5 rows that is why i am
05:16 - writing here 5
05:18 - if you want dynamically want to enter
05:21 - number of rows if you want to take a
05:22 - variable rows
05:24 - like 10 rows i want to print so what you
05:26 - can do i plus 1 less than equal to
05:28 - rows this i will show you when we will
05:31 - see the output on my laptop
05:33 - right so i hope you got it how to find
05:36 - out this condition maybe you are still
05:38 - confused
05:39 - like ha ha ma'am you can write how we
05:42 - are able to think i plus
05:44 - j less than equal to number of rows this
05:45 - would be the condition it's okay
05:48 - if you are a beginner in these kind of
05:51 - programs it's okay you have to practice
05:53 - ultimately when you will practice five
05:55 - or ten programs
05:56 - you will get after you will get like
06:00 - you will get what what kind of condition
06:02 - we can put here
06:03 - right automatically logic will click in
06:05 - your mind maybe
06:06 - if it's your second program third
06:08 - program or first program you are not
06:09 - able to
06:11 - you aren't able to think the logic like
06:13 - why
06:14 - i am putting i plus a less than equal to
06:15 - phi but you have to think over it
06:17 - this will come with practice only right
06:20 - you have to practice lots of printing
06:22 - pattern programs
06:24 - see now let me write down the logic
06:28 - i'm just writing down the main logic i'm
06:30 - not writing down the complete program so
06:32 - first of all the outer loop i'll
06:34 - i is equal to 1 i less than equal to
06:37 - 5 and i plus plus here 5
06:42 - this is for to printing number of rows
06:44 - or number of lines
06:45 - 1 to 5 lines so that is why i less than
06:47 - equal to 5
06:49 - right 10 lines 5 less than equal to 10
06:52 - or
06:52 - dynamically if you want to take the
06:54 - input let me write down that thing also
06:56 - suppose i want that user should enter at
06:58 - the right time
07:00 - number of rows so you can ask enter
07:03 - number of rows from the user and you can
07:05 - take this
07:06 - input using scan percentage d and
07:10 - variable name i am taking suppose
07:13 - rows three variables you have to decide
07:16 - you have to declare first i
07:18 - j and rows so now here simply you can
07:22 - write down i less than equal to number
07:24 - of rows or you can start this two with
07:26 - zero also it's up to you if you start
07:28 - with 0 i i is equal to 0 i less than
07:31 - rows you can change this condition so
07:33 - you can do this modification at your own
07:36 - i'm just know here to explain the logic
07:39 - here
07:40 - now inner loop
07:44 - j is equal to 1 i am starting with 1 j
07:47 - less than equal to 1
07:49 - number of rows right because
07:52 - see this is for outer within this i
07:56 - j should be repeated five times four
07:59 - times it should print space
08:01 - next time star in every row
08:04 - j should be repeated five times five
08:07 - times means number of rows time that is
08:09 - why i am writing here the same condition
08:10 - less than equal to number of rows
08:12 - right and now what j
08:16 - plus plus
08:19 - now you have to put some condition here
08:21 - what
08:22 - if i plus j
08:26 - less than equal to what
08:29 - number of rows
08:32 - then simply print
08:36 - space else
08:40 - what you have to print if this condition
08:43 - is not true print
08:46 - star in inner loop you will get this
08:48 - thing
08:49 - right and now after this in outer loop
08:53 - what you will print because after each
08:56 - line next line for next line
08:59 - we have to put slash n in outer loop and
09:02 - that's it
09:04 - now let me run this first at first see
09:08 - i value is 1 1 is less than equal to row
09:11 - suppose
09:12 - user is entering number of rows 5 number
09:15 - of rows
09:16 - i have entered 5 so
09:20 - i less than equal to number of rows
09:21 - condition true we are going to enter
09:23 - here
09:23 - now here j is equal to one j is equal to
09:26 - one one is also less than equal to five
09:28 - number of rows are five
09:29 - one less than equal to five yes
09:31 - condition true enter into the slope
09:33 - now see if i plus j now i value is 1 j
09:36 - value is 1
09:37 - 2 i plus j 2 2 less than equal to
09:41 - 5 yes condition true print space
09:44 - now space will be printed obviously i
09:47 - cannot print
09:48 - no space here so just let me
09:51 - do four space this underscore
09:55 - this is space space should be printed
09:56 - right space should be printed
09:59 - this condition true no else block would
10:01 - be executed
10:02 - now again j plus plus j is now 2
10:05 - condition true
10:06 - 2 is less than equal to 5 yes again
10:08 - enter here i plus j
10:09 - now 2 plus 1 3 3 less than equal to
10:11 - number of rows 5
10:13 - condition true again print space j plus
10:16 - plus
10:16 - 3 right now 3
10:19 - less than equal to number of rows yes
10:21 - condition 2 i plus j 3 plus 1 is 4 4
10:23 - less than equal to 5 yes condition true
10:25 - print space
10:27 - j plus plus that is 4 condition
10:30 - 4 less than equal to number of rows yes
10:32 - condition true again enter here
10:33 - i plus j 4 plus 1 5 5 less than equal to
10:36 - 5
10:37 - yes 5 is equal to 5 condition still true
10:40 - print space now j plus plus that is 5
10:44 - now 5 is less than equal to number of
10:46 - rows yes condition true enter again
10:48 - now i plus j five plus one is six now
10:50 - six less than equal to number of rows
10:52 - number of rows are five
10:53 - no condition is not true now we are not
10:55 - going to enter into if loop we are going
10:57 - to enter into else block now print star
10:59 - now print stuff
11:02 - right now j plus plus now j becomes 6
11:06 - is 6 less than equal to rows rows are 5
11:09 - condition is not true now out of this 4
11:12 - loop
11:13 - after this for loop what we have written
11:15 - slash n
11:16 - slash n means cursor would be in this
11:19 - line now
11:20 - right no printing cursor would be in
11:22 - this line
11:23 - now i plus plus now i becomes 2
11:26 - who is less than equal to number of rows
11:28 - yes condition true we are going to enter
11:29 - here now again j would be initialized
11:31 - with
11:32 - 1 again j is 1
11:36 - same process would be repeated again
11:39 - then for 3 then 4 then 4 5
11:43 - right when i becomes 6 this condition is
11:47 - also not true 6 less than equal to rows
11:49 - rows are 5
11:50 - this condition not true we are going to
11:52 - exit from the loop
11:53 - i hope you got the working of this loop
11:56 - right now to explain proper no the
12:00 - complete working
12:00 - i hope you got it now let me show you
12:03 - the output on my
12:04 - laptop see now let me show you the
12:07 - output on my
12:08 - vs code let me create a one more
12:11 - file pattern let me name it pattern four
12:15 - dot
12:16 - c
12:20 - header file
12:25 - main function that is very important
12:27 - it's like a driver
12:29 - for this program
12:34 - i and j for two loops variables and one
12:37 - as
12:38 - number of rows fine
12:41 - we are going to take input from the user
12:43 - how many rows a user want
12:45 - right so
12:52 - enter number of rows fine
12:58 - we will take input using what's scanf
13:01 - percentage d address of the name of the
13:05 - variable is
13:06 - rows now outer loop
13:10 - i is equal to i'm going to start this
13:13 - loop from 1 you can start it with
13:14 - 0 up it's up to you according to that
13:17 - you can change the condition
13:18 - right i'm going to start from 1 i
13:22 - now what less than equal to
13:27 - rows and i plus plus
13:31 - right now inner loop
13:34 - is responsible for printing so
13:38 - j is equal to 1
13:42 - and semicolon now j less than equal to
13:45 - same number of rows and j plus plus
13:50 - now in this we are going to put some
13:52 - condition suppose you have to print
13:54 - space or star
13:56 - if condition is i
13:59 - plus j right
14:02 - i plus j is less than equal to
14:06 - rows then
14:09 - what you will print
14:12 - printf just space
14:17 - right otherwise
14:20 - else what
14:24 - would be printed printf
14:28 - star i'm not putting any curly braces
14:31 - any finesse because i am
14:32 - using only one statement so no need to
14:35 - put curly braces
14:36 - i hope you got it because i already
14:38 - discussed when you were discussing it
14:40 - fails
14:40 - so now uh yeah one more thing you have
14:43 - to print in outer loop what
14:45 - slashing now
14:48 - slasher and that's it now we have to run
14:52 - this program let me run this
14:55 - and it will ask from the user enter
14:57 - number of rows 5
14:58 - or 10 whatever number of rows you want
15:00 - you can enter see enter number of
15:02 - rows 5 i'm entering and see the output
15:07 - again let me run it
15:10 - for 10 number of rows now here this time
15:13 - i'm entering
15:14 - 10 number of rows and see the output
15:17 - right again suppose you want to run and
15:21 - uh
15:21 - for 20 see the output
15:24 - for 20 rows i hope you got it right
15:34 - now i hope you got how to print this
15:35 - pattern if you are not getting
15:37 - how to figure out this condition it's
15:39 - okay
15:40 - we will do more printing pattern
15:42 - programs and with practice
15:44 - ultimately you will get what kind of
15:45 - condition we can put to print
15:47 - that kind of pattern right so now i'll
15:50 - see you in the next video till then
15:51 - bye take care
