00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language in the
00:04 - previous video we have done one coding
00:06 - exercise we have calculated the number
00:08 - of cans needed to paint a wall in this
00:10 - video also we'll do one more coding
00:12 - exercise
00:13 - now that is not so tough we have to
00:16 - calculate you have to find out the
00:17 - number is prime or not so you have to
00:18 - define a function you have to pass the
00:20 - number as an argument and you have to
00:21 - write down the logic to check the number
00:23 - is prime or not so there are C many
00:25 - logics many ways many approaches to find
00:28 - out the number is prime or not but if
00:30 - you are a winner then obviously you will
00:31 - select you will think I guess the normal
00:34 - one it's okay you will not consider that
00:36 - that optimization of the program as a
00:39 - important factor right now it's okay
00:42 - first write down the simple approach
00:43 - then you can try out different different
00:44 - approaches one by one we'll be
00:46 - discussing two approaches in this video
00:47 - with the help of program I'll show you
00:49 - but first you have to try this out right
00:52 - now before that just want to discuss
00:54 - with you something important something
00:55 - important especially important for those
00:57 - who are interested in making their
00:59 - career in data science or who are still
01:01 - confused
01:02 - about their career which field they
01:04 - should choose right so see data science
01:08 - is one of the fastest growing industry
01:10 - in the world right now
01:13 - right because by 2026
01:15 - data science Industry is expected to
01:17 - generate 11.5 million jobs across the
01:20 - globe
01:22 - so in this field the opportunities for
01:25 - career growth are very high and even
01:26 - known it people can apply see there are
01:29 - plenty of opportunities in this field
01:30 - but not so many skilled professional to
01:33 - fill this role because what matters in
01:35 - the industry today is in demand skills
01:37 - relevant and hands-on experience rather
01:40 - than just conventional degrees
01:42 - so one of the best platform to get these
01:44 - in-demand skills is odd in school and
01:47 - their six month data science bootcamp
01:49 - which would be started from 27th of May
01:52 - so the data science bootcamp is perfect
01:54 - for anyone who wants to access industry
01:56 - align education other reasonable price
01:57 - as you can see plus they have
01:59 - scholarship option of rupees 30k up to
02:01 - rupees 30k and no cost tmi's option is
02:04 - also available plus they have an
02:06 - discount of 10 000 rupees for early bird
02:10 - and that's not it it comes with proven
02:12 - placement reports and 360 degree
02:14 - placement assistance they have 500 plus
02:17 - hiring Partners the top tech companies
02:19 - like Accenture Deloitte Google and many
02:21 - more companies as you can see and don't
02:23 - just go with my words you can see their
02:25 - own success stories see this there are
02:27 - many success stories as you can see here
02:29 - one is vishweswari and she is now a
02:32 - senior Analyst at capgemini and uh she
02:35 - was a full-time mother and had a career
02:37 - gap of six years and now she is a senior
02:39 - Analyst at capture my life so be it a
02:41 - career launch or career change or career
02:45 - growth data science has diverse
02:48 - opportunities for all the aspirants so
02:50 - if you would like to kick start your
02:51 - career in this field you're not in
02:53 - school today and what is the process to
02:54 - apply for this thing you have to just
02:55 - fill out this detail and request a call
02:57 - back sword in school team will call you
03:00 - back in within one hour two days so you
03:02 - can ask your doubts if anything you have
03:04 - right so the registration link and all
03:06 - the relevant information you will get in
03:08 - the description box of this video you
03:09 - can go and check out now let's pause the
03:12 - video and try out this program okay so I
03:14 - hope you have done this that was not so
03:17 - tough so let's create a new file land
03:19 - try this out it's prime number or you
03:23 - can say Prime checker
03:25 - crime Checker dot p y
03:28 - right okay so first thing we have to
03:31 - take a number input right so suppose we
03:35 - are taking a variable n and they are
03:38 - using input function we'll take a number
03:41 - like enter a
03:43 - number
03:44 - fine and during this time only we will
03:47 - convert this into int because by default
03:49 - using input if you take so that number
03:51 - would be considered as string so you
03:52 - Typecast that and that would mean end so
03:56 - suppose we are creating a function like
03:58 - Prime
03:59 - checker
04:01 - right and right now we are calling this
04:03 - function and we are passing this and in
04:05 - this function Prime Checker n but still
04:08 - we haven't defined the function so let's
04:10 - define the function first before calling
04:13 - you have to define the function
04:14 - otherwise it will give error it's not
04:16 - like that first we call and after that
04:18 - here we Define the function no before
04:19 - you have to define the function before
04:21 - calling
04:22 - so let's define this depth and same name
04:26 - you have to take and here just a
04:29 - variable
04:30 - to accept this n this number suppose we
04:34 - are taking number for same or you can
04:36 - take like n n that is also fine same
04:39 - variable name you can take right
04:42 - have to Define them how to check see we
04:45 - know one is not a prime number it's a
04:48 - composite number
04:50 - right so how to check if suppose a
04:53 - number is like we have our number five
04:57 - so how you will check it is a prime or
04:59 - not
05:00 - for sure it will be divided by 1 and
05:03 - itself
05:04 - one and five that's for sure but you
05:06 - have to find out any other factors so
05:08 - check if 5 is divisible by 2 then 5 is
05:11 - divisible by 3 5 is divisible by 4.
05:15 - till that number minus 1. right so if it
05:19 - is completely divisible like the
05:21 - remainder is zero
05:23 - then yeah it is having the number is
05:25 - having other factors as well and it is
05:27 - not a prime number right
05:29 - so first thing you have to use modulo
05:31 - operator to check the remainder we have
05:33 - an operator module operator so five like
05:36 - five this is more operator mode two
05:40 - equal to equal to zero
05:43 - right like this then again we check five
05:47 - mode three then we check five
05:50 - more four
05:52 - till 4 OK because we know 5 is divisible
05:56 - by 5 itself right so if number is 7 we
06:00 - check
06:01 - by divisible by two three four five six
06:06 - till that number minus one yeah it's
06:08 - very basic approach it's not so
06:10 - optimized approach to find out a prime
06:12 - number in case of if you consider that
06:14 - time complexity and space complexity
06:16 - okay but for beginner uh for beginners I
06:20 - am discussing this approach right
06:22 - because if you are a beginner if you are
06:24 - a name then obviously this approach will
06:26 - be in your mind rather than yeah there
06:28 - are many other methods also to optimize
06:31 - the solution right but this is the basic
06:34 - one
06:35 - right check with all the like two three
06:39 - four till number minus one
06:41 - okay
06:43 - and if it is divisible by any number
06:45 - like if I have 6 so 6 would be divisible
06:48 - by
06:49 - 2 as well as 3.
06:52 - right so obviously that is not a prime
06:54 - number okay because six mode two will be
06:57 - zero if you divide six by two then
06:59 - remainder would be zero so like this
07:02 - uh you know formula we will apply here
07:05 - so how to apply this thing and one is
07:08 - not a prime number it is a composite
07:09 - number so you can just write down like
07:11 - we check for I in
07:15 - range
07:16 - range would be from 2 to
07:20 - that number minus 1 2 2
07:23 - if number is five then two to four we
07:25 - will check number minus one so here
07:26 - simply you can write down number
07:29 - because it will generate the range will
07:32 - generate if the number is 5 we are
07:35 - taking the number as 5
07:36 - then it will generate 2 3 4 these three
07:40 - and
07:42 - these three numbers you want that's it
07:44 - because we know 5 would be divisible by
07:46 - 5 itself and one itself right so we
07:49 - check for I in this range
07:52 - like
07:53 - so if
07:54 - if
07:56 - the number whatever the number
07:59 - this number
08:03 - I
08:04 - equal to equal to zero
08:07 - means it is divisible by maybe either
08:10 - two three or four then it is not a prime
08:12 - number right so maybe simply you can
08:14 - write down here print
08:16 - it is not a prime number
08:18 - right
08:20 - and else it is not a prime number but
08:22 - here what do we take the general form we
08:24 - will take we will take a suppose
08:26 - variable here I am taking a variable
08:27 - like a number is
08:30 - available is prime equal to first I am
08:34 - setting it to true
08:36 - so if this is true this condition is
08:39 - true just set this variable is prime
08:42 - just flip this variable S Prime is equal
08:44 - to
08:46 - false
08:48 - right
08:49 - this would be in this if statement would
08:52 - be in for Loop that's it no need of else
08:55 - now after for Loop we check we check
08:58 - this variable is prime if
09:02 - is prime
09:03 - is equal to is equal to still it is true
09:08 - means we can simply print here
09:12 - and else we simply print not a prime
09:15 - number and what about if you want to uh
09:18 - write down that thing also what about
09:20 - the one
09:22 - if somebody enter one then what about
09:24 - that thing let's suppose we simply run
09:26 - this program right now we are not doing
09:28 - any update right now right so let's run
09:31 - this
09:32 - and enter a number I'm entering Phi
09:36 - it is a prime number see the number is 5
09:39 - here number becomes 5 so is prime a
09:42 - variable that is true now for I in range
09:45 - two two numbers so it will generate two
09:47 - three four so first it will check the
09:50 - number is 5 5 more
09:52 - first time in i 2 will be assigned five
09:55 - more two equal to equal to 0 no if you
09:58 - divide 5 by 2 then remainder would be
10:01 - one so this condition is not true so
10:03 - control will not enter here
10:05 - so is prime is still true now I is I is
10:09 - 3 so 5 more 3 equal to 0 No 5 Mode 4
10:14 - equal to zero no so control will not
10:17 - enter in this if block and
10:20 - after we are
10:22 - till 4 it will because now we are in end
10:25 - of the range range function like four so
10:28 - now this for Loop is complete now if is
10:30 - prime true yes S Prime is still true
10:32 - because control haven't entered in this
10:35 - if bro so yeah it is a prime number
10:39 - right or rather than if S Prime is equal
10:41 - to equal to true you can simply write
10:43 - down this thing if is prime that is also
10:45 - fine because S Prime is true so both are
10:48 - same
10:49 - but if I run this again and if I enter 1
10:54 - then it is a prime number
10:57 - one is not a prime number we know it's a
10:58 - composite number
11:00 - right according to the definition of the
11:02 - prime number
11:03 - right
11:04 - so now why it is showing 1 is a prime
11:07 - number because
11:09 - number is 1 so range function obviously
11:11 - will not generate anything because 2
11:14 - and number is 1 so 2 to 0 it should
11:17 - generate but that is not a valid range
11:19 - so it will not generate anything the
11:21 - portal would not be executed and is
11:22 - prime is true still so now this if
11:25 - condition is prime is true so control
11:28 - will enter here so it will enter it is a
11:30 - prime number so better here you write
11:33 - one more thing like if
11:36 - this number equal to equal to 1 so here
11:39 - we can simply
11:43 - flip this one
11:45 - this variable is prime is equal to
11:48 - false
11:50 - now let's run this
11:52 - enter a number one
11:54 - say not a prime number
11:56 - okay
11:58 - so
12:00 - if this is 1 is prime becomes false and
12:03 - follow who don't be executed because
12:04 - there is no range function
12:06 - obviously if the number is 1. so now if
12:09 - this if would be checked if S Prime no
12:12 - it is not true it is false so else would
12:14 - be executed and not a prime number like
12:16 - this
12:17 - so like this you can check if the number
12:19 - is prime or not but how you can update
12:21 - this thing rather than checking if the
12:23 - number is like if the number is
12:26 - Maybe 11.
12:28 - so we have to check two three four five
12:32 - six seven eight nine ten till 10 you
12:36 - have to divide this phone would be
12:37 - executed 10 times but there is no need
12:41 - why so
12:42 - if you check
12:45 - the number divided by 2 means 11 divided
12:48 - by 2 that becomes
12:51 - five point something so you can say
12:53 - let's suppose 6. so just check till 6.
12:57 - if there is if the 11 is completely
12:59 - divisible by
13:01 - till 6 2 3 4 5 6 then it is not a prime
13:05 - number no need to check till the number
13:07 - minus one
13:09 - right
13:11 - this is second approach I hope you got
13:13 - this so if I write down here this number
13:16 - divided by the range should be this
13:18 - number divided by 2.
13:21 - but 11 divided by 2 it would be some
13:24 - decimal so let's round up this number
13:27 - better round of this number rather than
13:29 - just rounding the number
13:30 - right so you will seal function so how
13:32 - to use you have to import
13:35 - first math
13:38 - module and here we can use
13:41 - math dot in previous video also we have
13:43 - used this one
13:45 - so you can check out that video
13:49 - seal number divided by 2 and better do
13:51 - plus one because the range would
13:53 - generate
13:54 - whatever this number minus 1. so here
13:57 - the number is suppose 6 so it will
13:59 - generate
14:00 - 2 3 4 5. 1 minus and we want it should
14:05 - generate till that number
14:07 - till that divided number that half
14:09 - number so better to add 1 here
14:13 - okay okay now let's run this
14:16 - and if I run 2 it is a prime number
14:20 - let's run this again three it is a prime
14:23 - number okay let's take a number six not
14:26 - a prime number
14:27 - so now this time complexity would
14:30 - becomes less because rather than rather
14:33 - than you know if the number is 11 so
14:34 - rather than comparing rather than you
14:36 - know uh generating this two three four
14:39 - five six seven eight nine ten till 10 it
14:43 - will generate only two three four five
14:44 - six like this
14:46 - right
14:48 - so less time it will take
14:51 - and there are multiple
14:54 - methods also
14:55 - not just these two square root method is
14:58 - also there that also you can do so you
15:01 - can just search how to find out the
15:02 - number is prime and order an optimized
15:04 - solution and you can try out that thing
15:06 - also right okay now you have to try out
15:10 - this is for your assignment these two
15:12 - methods we have discussed
15:13 - one two more methods you have to find
15:17 - out or at least one that square root
15:19 - method
15:20 - how to check the number is prime or not
15:22 - with that square root method right and
15:24 - you can just write down that chord the
15:26 - logic in comment section
15:28 - okay
15:29 - so I hope you have done this exercise so
15:31 - now in the next video we'll work on a
15:32 - project so now I see the next video
15:34 - thank you
