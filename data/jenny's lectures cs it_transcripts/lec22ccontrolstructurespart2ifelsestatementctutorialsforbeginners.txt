00:00 - so in the series of learning c plus
00:02 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - control structures in c plus plus in the
00:05 - previous video we have discussed
00:07 - if statement that is you can say single
00:09 - selection statement you give some
00:11 - condition if that condition is true
00:13 - whatever you will write within that
00:14 - fifth block that will be executed right
00:17 - after that whatever statement you will
00:18 - write after a blog that will be executed
00:21 - right
00:21 - that is single selection now suppose you
00:24 - have two choices
00:25 - if this otherwise this in real life also
00:28 - we have these kind of choices so that
00:30 - you can you know implement in
00:32 - programming with the help of if else
00:34 - block or you can say if else statements
00:37 - so what is this fl statement how to use
00:38 - these statement in your program
00:40 - whatever you know some tricky things we
00:42 - can do with if else not just simply
00:45 - fails feel right same with if we have
00:47 - discussed with effects we will discuss
00:49 - what whatever tricky things we can do
00:51 - and whatever tricky type of questions an
00:53 - interviewer can ask from you or whatever
00:56 - kind of questions you will get in those
00:58 - competitive type of exams tricky
01:00 - questions although maybe you know it
01:02 - seems very simple if blog posts blog but
01:06 - they ask some tricky things
01:08 - you haven't seen those kind of things
01:10 - with you haven't tried even those kind
01:12 - of things with if block and else block
01:14 - or if else statements right
01:17 - so those thing also we'll discuss in
01:18 - this video with the help of a program
01:20 - all the points indeed we will discuss if
01:23 - else block
01:24 - now before that let me just uh tell you
01:28 - a website from which you can learn
01:29 - coding and practice some questions
01:31 - coding ninjas yes coding in jazz courses
01:33 - from basic to advanced level in
01:35 - programming in c plus java machine
01:38 - learning data science web development
01:39 - android development and it is one of the
01:42 - biggest
01:43 - coding education company which have
01:45 - taught around 50 000 students and the
01:48 - courses are very well structured for
01:50 - students and you will get here
01:52 - exceptional content the courses are very
01:54 - good
01:54 - curated by their experts from iit stand
01:57 - for amazon facebook
01:59 - one more thing you will get one-to-one
02:01 - doubt resolution support your doubt will
02:03 - be resolved within one to two hours that
02:05 - is i guess a good point
02:07 - and thousand plus questions asked in the
02:10 - companies like google amazon microsoft
02:12 - and more to practice
02:14 - and also it is having very good rating
02:17 - on google and facebook so if students
02:19 - put right you know
02:21 - hard work and effort then these courses
02:23 - are i guess enough to create any tech
02:25 - job interview
02:27 - so you can use the link in the
02:28 - description box of this video to avail
02:29 - 50 discount on all the coding ninjas
02:32 - courses and this discount you can make
02:34 - this discount on about early bird so the
02:36 - all the relevant links and detail i'll
02:38 - put in the description box of this video
02:39 - you can go and check out now let's see
02:41 - what is if else statement okay let's
02:44 - take first a real life example suppose
02:46 - uh your mo your mother asked you to go
02:49 - to supermarket and buy some vegetables
02:51 - you will say
02:52 - what i should buy so your mother will
02:55 - say like ladyfinger
02:57 - right mindy which is my favorite
03:00 - so and if you ask if
03:02 - bhindi is not available in them in that
03:04 - market then
03:05 - what else second choice is what
03:08 - then maybe your mother say like second
03:10 - choice is uh you can buy
03:13 - any you can say potato
03:15 - right so two choices you have
03:18 - first choice is lady finger if not
03:20 - available then potato
03:22 - otherwise
03:24 - okay you can go home
03:26 - in the previous case we have discussed
03:28 - if block in that case we have single
03:29 - selection means if you relate it with
03:31 - this example then your mother say if
03:34 - ladyfinger available then
03:36 - buy that thing no otherwise option
03:39 - no option you have no second choice you
03:40 - have if not available
03:43 - come to home right but here we have two
03:45 - choices
03:47 - so same these kind of sources we have in
03:49 - programs so to implement these kind of
03:51 - choices in real life we use otherwise
03:53 - word otherwise uh
03:55 - no word english word but here if you
03:57 - want to implement these two choices
03:59 - these kind of scenario in program then
04:01 - what you use if else statement
04:04 - if condition
04:06 - rather than otherwise we use here the
04:07 - keyword else
04:09 - right i hope you are going to relate
04:12 - this with this example
04:14 - right
04:15 - so now what is the general syntax how
04:17 - you write first of all you write if and
04:19 - then
04:20 - condition in these brackets
04:23 - the condition can be an expression or
04:25 - constant value right condition can be
04:27 - combination of and it can be combination
04:29 - of two or more condition
04:30 - right with logical and logical or
04:33 - operator you can combine these statement
04:34 - relational operator you can use with
04:36 - this condition but ultimately this
04:37 - condition
04:38 - should evaluate to boolean value either
04:40 - true or false so if condition then
04:44 - here we can say if block statements
04:48 - we write
04:50 - more than one statement you write then
04:52 - put it put this curly basis else
04:56 - else block statement
04:59 - this is general syntax to write
05:01 - this
05:02 - and after this
05:04 - you can say
05:05 - after
05:06 - if else block statement
05:10 - these statements are not part of this if
05:12 - else block right so what the working of
05:14 - this is what if this condition is true
05:17 - true then
05:19 - control will enter into this if block
05:21 - and whatever
05:22 - condition whatever statement you will
05:23 - write within this if looked
05:26 - those statement will be executed right
05:28 - and this else statement would be skipped
05:31 - right then after execution of this
05:33 - directly control will go to after if
05:35 - else block statement
05:37 - if the condition is false if the
05:39 - condition is false in that case
05:42 - this else part control will go to the
05:44 - else part and these statements would be
05:46 - executed
05:48 - these if statement would be skipped and
05:51 - after execution of the sales part the
05:53 - control will go to the after reference
05:55 - block statement so these after effects
05:58 - block statement would be executed
06:02 - after
06:03 - if the condition is true then also the
06:04 - condition is false then also
06:06 - right
06:07 - it doesn't matter condition is true or
06:08 - false these statement would be executed
06:10 - because these are part of program these
06:12 - are out of this effects block
06:15 - right
06:15 - so obviously two uh case can be there
06:17 - condition can be may be true or false
06:20 - right i hope you got the working of this
06:22 - let me just
06:23 - ah
06:24 - explain this with the help of flowchart
06:26 - ok
06:27 - we are just a program we have some
06:29 - statement
06:30 - in the program we are executing those
06:32 - statements and after that suddenly we
06:33 - find if
06:34 - condition
06:36 - so this is you can say you can say entry
06:38 - or you can say the program is going to
06:39 - be executed right then suddenly we find
06:42 - a condition
06:44 - so two cases can be there
06:46 - one can be false
06:48 - one can be true if true then
06:51 - this
06:52 - if block
06:54 - statements would be executed
06:56 - if false then
07:00 - else block
07:02 - statements would be executed
07:04 - right
07:05 - after that
07:07 - after
07:10 - if else
07:11 - block statements
07:14 - would be executed right
07:16 - after s block as well as after if block
07:19 - and after that
07:21 - if you have any other thing in the
07:22 - program those would be executed or you
07:24 - can say exit from the program right so
07:26 - this is simple working of fels block
07:28 - with the help of flowchart i hope you
07:30 - got the working now let me just
07:33 - write down a program and we will discuss
07:35 - this thing with the help of that program
07:37 - right
07:40 - let's take the same example we have
07:42 - taken in the previous video if you have
07:44 - money
07:46 - greater than
07:47 - more than thousand rupees
07:49 - then you will
07:51 - have coffee in starbucks
07:53 - otherwise you will have cofine ccd
07:56 - and then you will come home two choices
07:58 - you have starbucks and ccd
08:01 - right the condition is
08:02 - for going to starbuckses money should be
08:05 - greater than
08:06 - thousand
08:07 - so simply the logic i am writing
08:10 - if
08:12 - money greater than and equal to suppose
08:14 - thousand rupees
08:16 - right
08:17 - obviously i am not writing the whole
08:19 - program you have to write those header
08:21 - file then you have to initialize you
08:23 - have to declare this money main function
08:26 - and all you have to write right those
08:27 - who will discuss on my laptop if money
08:30 - greater than equal to thousand then i am
08:31 - going to print c out
08:36 - whatever money you have that you will
08:38 - print right
08:41 - and then see out
08:45 - coffee in starbucks
08:50 - right
08:51 - else
08:53 - same we will print c out
08:55 - whatever money you have that money i
08:58 - have
09:02 - and
09:06 - coffee in ccd
09:10 - and after that i'm just printing
09:12 - let's go home
09:16 - that's it
09:17 - right
09:19 - so if you enter like money 900 rupees
09:23 - 900 rupees the condition is not true so
09:26 - this if block would not be executed
09:28 - control will go to the else block and
09:30 - this would be executed so what will be
09:31 - printed money i have
09:33 - 900 rupees and kofi ccd and then this
09:36 - will be printed let's go home
09:39 - right
09:40 - these three see out would be executed if
09:42 - i enter money 1200 means condition now
09:44 - true 1200 so now this if block statement
09:47 - would be executed control will enter
09:49 - into the shift block money i have is
09:51 - 1200 then coffee in starbucks this else
09:54 - statement would not be executed after
09:55 - that directly control will go to the
09:57 - this part after if it fails block
09:59 - statement let us go home would be
10:01 - printed right now what tricky things you
10:04 - can do with this like if i put semicolon
10:06 - here
10:07 - what would be the output
10:09 - if i don't write semicolon here but
10:11 - semicolon
10:12 - here
10:13 - what would be the output if i put
10:14 - semicolon in both the cases what would
10:16 - be the output right if i remove these
10:20 - i'm not putting semicolon i'm removing
10:23 - these what would be the output right
10:25 - now i'm not removing these i'm removing
10:27 - these then what will be the output so
10:29 - these different type of
10:31 - you know things we can do with this but
10:33 - these things will discuss practically on
10:35 - my laptop so let's just run this program
10:38 - first
10:39 - okay so we have this program
10:41 - header file using namespace studio then
10:43 - main function i'm declaring a variable
10:44 - into money and i'm just asking from user
10:47 - how much money you have then we are
10:49 - entering the menu money we are taking
10:51 - the input using seen
10:53 - now checking the condition if money
10:54 - greater than equal to thousand then
10:56 - whatever it will print the money you
10:58 - have and then let's have coffee in
11:00 - starbucks else
11:01 - the money you have and let's have coffee
11:03 - in ccd and after that let's go home
11:05 - right
11:06 - simple now let's just run this
11:12 - see it is asking how much you have so
11:14 - i'm entering now 1200
11:17 - so it will print money i have 1200 let's
11:20 - have coffee in starbucks and then let's
11:22 - go home after he fails blog
11:24 - if i again run this and how much you
11:27 - have i have 300
11:29 - let's have the money i have is 300 let's
11:32 - have coffee in ccd now else part because
11:34 - condition is not real
11:36 - 300 is less than 1000 rupees you cannot
11:38 - have coffee in starbucks because
11:40 - omega let's go home right
11:43 - now second thing is what
11:45 - see if i put semicolon here
11:48 - sorry
11:49 - after this so means it will
11:52 - terminate
11:56 - okay
12:02 - i'm putting semicolon after this if
12:04 - block means it will terminate this if in
12:06 - the previous case when we were
12:08 - discussing if statement simply
12:10 - it will not give any error
12:12 - right it will terminate the same but in
12:14 - this case it will give error
12:16 - see this
12:17 - below this is else you can see a red
12:19 - line so it is an error whenever i run
12:21 - this see
12:23 - what error you will get else without a
12:26 - previous if
12:28 - you cannot write down because we have
12:30 - terminated this if
12:32 - there is no point of
12:34 - if now in this program means there is no
12:37 - f in this program now and we are using
12:39 - else so without if you cannot use else
12:44 - make this point as a note without if you
12:47 - cannot write down else but
12:49 - without else you can write down if that
12:51 - we have discussed in previous video
12:53 - you can write down if no need to write
12:55 - down else but without any previous if
12:57 - you cannot write down this else so it
12:59 - will give error
13:01 - save if you terminate this else also
13:04 - then also it will give error right
13:06 - although obviously you are using the
13:08 - cells you are terminating but you are
13:09 - using this else right and you are
13:11 - terminating this if here so it is not
13:13 - finding
13:14 - any previous so then also it will give
13:16 - error now if i not
13:18 - write here
13:21 - the semicolon after if but semicolon
13:23 - after else then it will not give any
13:26 - error but you have terminated now this
13:27 - else
13:28 - there is no use of this else now see
13:32 - it would be run
13:33 - if i run this then how much money you
13:35 - have
13:36 - suppose i write 1200 means condition is
13:38 - true
13:40 - it should execute only the if statement
13:41 - and after that after refill after
13:43 - effects block else statement else block
13:46 - statement would be skipped but now it
13:48 - will not
13:50 - skip this see money i have 1200 let's
13:53 - have coffee in starbucks okay fine again
13:55 - money i have 1200 let's have coffee in
13:57 - ccd and then let's go home because we
14:00 - have terminated this else so there is no
14:02 - use of this else these two statements
14:05 - would be executed
14:07 - right no matter condition is true or
14:09 - false because these two two statement
14:11 - would be now as a part of program means
14:13 - after the defense block statement right
14:16 - so it will not give error but yeah this
14:19 - output you will get
14:20 - right
14:21 - now
14:25 - let's just do this and see now let's
14:28 - remove the yeast curly braces
14:33 - now
14:34 - we are writing two statement
14:36 - so now by default it will consider only
14:38 - one statement as part of if block if you
14:40 - are not using these curly braces right
14:42 - and these c outlets have coffee in
14:44 - starbucks
14:45 - now it would be a part of after if blog
14:49 - right
14:51 - and after the statement you are using
14:52 - this else
14:54 - so that is not possible here also you
14:56 - will get same error
14:58 - what are then misplaced
15:00 - hence see
15:03 - okay let me just uh save the send on
15:05 - this again see else without a previous
15:08 - if
15:09 - right
15:11 - because after if only one statement is
15:13 - part of if and you have written a
15:15 - statement
15:16 - right so
15:18 - directly else should be directly after
15:20 - if no there would be no other statement
15:23 - between if and else right otherwise else
15:26 - would be a
15:27 - it will give error like else without a
15:29 - pvc
15:30 - right so you can write down this else
15:32 - after this first c out see how many i
15:35 - have after that you can write down this
15:36 - else below that is fine that will work
15:39 - right now let me just
15:41 - put these curly braces here
15:44 - and i am just
15:46 - removing else curly braces
15:50 - it will not give any errors
15:52 - right it will work fine but
15:55 - only one point
15:57 - this first statement see out money i
15:59 - have would be considered as part of else
16:02 - law the second statement let's have
16:04 - coffee in ccd will be a part of
16:06 - after a fails block okay let's just run
16:09 - this
16:12 - if the money is i have 200 only so
16:14 - condition is not true control will go to
16:16 - the else part
16:18 - right
16:19 - so it will print money i have let's have
16:21 - coffee in ccd let's go home okay you are
16:24 - not able to see any difference here let
16:26 - me just run this again and
16:28 - right now i'm putting 1200
16:31 - means condition is true
16:32 - it should
16:34 - print only
16:35 - money i have 1200 let's have copy in
16:37 - starbucks and let's go home right okay
16:41 - it will print
16:42 - money i have 1200 let's have coffee in
16:44 - starbucks and let's have coffee in ccd
16:46 - then let's go home
16:48 - why these two let's have copying ccd
16:50 - also because now this
16:52 - line is also a part of after effects
16:54 - block you are not putting a semi uh that
16:56 - those curly braces so only one line
16:58 - would be considered as part of else
17:00 - block that is why
17:02 - so starbucks also security also right
17:06 - okay now i guess that's it
17:08 - about this if else block
17:11 - defense statement
17:14 - if you are trying something with this if
17:16 - else and you are not getting why you are
17:18 - getting that kind of output because you
17:20 - also can try different different things
17:21 - with if else law it's not like that
17:23 - whatever the syntax according to that
17:25 - only write defense block do some tricky
17:27 - things with these
17:30 - programs by yourself
17:32 - and find out what kind of
17:34 - output you are getting and why also the
17:35 - reason also so i hope you got the
17:37 - working of if else statement now the one
17:39 - assignment for you is you have to take
17:41 - two variables one is money second is age
17:43 - and you have to put two condition in
17:45 - this if block
17:46 - money if greater than equal to thousand
17:49 - as well as age should be greater than
17:52 - twenty
17:57 - if both the conditions are true money
17:59 - greater than equal to thousand is
18:01 - greater than 20 both the conditions are
18:02 - true in that case only you can have
18:04 - coffee in starbucks
18:06 - right otherwise coffee in ccd so you
18:08 - have to put these two conditions so this
18:10 - is assignment for you guys
18:12 - although i haven't tried starbucks
18:14 - coffee but i'll try someday anyways in
18:17 - the next video we'll see elsie flatter
18:19 - so i'll see in the next video till then
18:20 - bye take
