00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in this video we will
00:04 - discuss if I had to restart my career or
00:07 - more precisely if I say if I had to
00:09 - restart my coding Journey from a fresh
00:12 - then what would be my strategy what I
00:14 - will learn which language technology
00:17 - framework or in which direction I'll go
00:19 - what would be my path or you can say
00:21 - what advice I will give to myself right
00:25 - so this thing we'll be discussing in
00:26 - this video so mainly if this is the case
00:29 - with with my with me then I'll Focus
00:32 - mainly on three things so basically
00:33 - three things we'll discuss in this video
00:35 - right first thing I will learn
00:38 - JavaScript definitely yeah no Java
00:41 - python or C++ I'll go for JavaScript
00:43 - because this is according to my personal
00:46 - interest I want to go in this
00:47 - development field actually right but
00:50 - apart from this interest kind of thing
00:53 - from joob point of view also this is a
00:56 - very good field to go into right because
00:59 - there are many job opening also for
01:01 - software developer jobs as we know
01:03 - salary is also good like you you'll get
01:05 - a good package so this is also a point
01:08 - to go into this field web development
01:11 - field right so I learn first JavaScript
01:14 - definitely right it's not like that this
01:17 - is the only way but it's my interest and
01:20 - definitely JavaScript is no scaling it
01:24 - is now everywhere everywhere almost
01:28 - right so the is having a very good
01:31 - score you can enter into this tech
01:36 - industry with this field also I mean
01:39 - using your development skills learn webd
01:43 - and you can enter into this Tech field
01:45 - and you can reach up to a very good
01:48 - level into those mang Fang companies as
01:51 - well right so yeah I know actually that
01:56 - another path is also there like uh go
02:00 - for DSA if you are good in that field
02:01 - that in that thing also DSA kind of
02:04 - thing then you can also enter into the
02:05 - these companies right like if you are
02:08 - from a good college and these type of
02:10 - companies the top tech companies are
02:12 - coming to your college for on campus
02:14 - placement so definitely in interview
02:15 - they ask DSA question almost in every
02:18 - round So based on that also if you are
02:20 - having one or two project you know and
02:24 - not very very good project but you have
02:26 - like yeah good project and you are very
02:29 - good in DSC in problem solving you have
02:31 - those skills then definitely you have a
02:33 - great chance to enter into these
02:35 - companies but yeah I know DSA is tough
02:39 - actually and it's not possible for
02:42 - everyone to master DSA right those
02:45 - algorithms and all so in my case I'll
02:49 - choose that second path first JavaScript
02:54 - in web I I'll go in development type of
02:56 - uh development field right then second
02:59 - thing I'll start working on
03:02 - projects yeah rather than you know uh
03:05 - devoting or wasting more and more time
03:08 - on those programs only like we do print
03:11 - hello world program or palindrome
03:14 - factorial Feb series pattern type of
03:17 - program and many programs are there
03:20 - these kind of and we we we understand
03:22 - and we we know devote so much time by uh
03:25 - you know to understand the concept
03:27 - behind these programs and you know just
03:30 - for writing these programs yeah that
03:32 - thing is also important right just
03:35 - devote you know dedicate your time for
03:37 - this thing also but not much much much
03:39 - time start working projects as soon as
03:44 - possible right because this is very
03:48 - important when you are going to work on
03:50 - a start making simple project maybe just
03:53 - only you know by that that front end
03:56 - only right by clicking on that button
03:59 - this would be be this would happen or
04:01 - redirect a page or these kind of things
04:03 - simple things then uh attach or work on
04:08 - back end also have some database for
04:10 - your project because obviously in
04:12 - industry or in real life that would be
04:14 - required you have to deal with data also
04:16 - so you have you have some knowledge of
04:18 - if you have some knowledge of database
04:20 - that would be good for you then work on
04:22 - back end also have some database SQL my
04:24 - SQL or mongodb or any other database
04:28 - right connectivity and all so front end
04:31 - as well as back end because see uh when
04:34 - we will be working on projects then
04:36 - these concept all these Theory concept
04:40 - these Loops concept or those programs
04:43 - you write in the beginning those concept
04:47 - would be more clear to you guys when you
04:50 - work on project so this thing is
04:52 - important right start working on Project
04:56 - as soon as possible I'll be doing this
04:57 - thing if I had to restart my my journey
