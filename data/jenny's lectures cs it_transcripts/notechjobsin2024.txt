00:33 - many more companies even I have heard a
00:35 - news those te off number in 2024 touch
00:39 - 50k and it's not a good news everybody
00:42 - is worried about their career whether
00:44 - he's a working professional or he's in
00:45 - college second year third year final
00:47 - year student right and yeah I agree
00:50 - these kind of news we should worried
00:51 - about you know these kind of news a
00:53 - little bit right so in this video we'll
00:57 - be discussing what should we do during
01:00 - this recession time whether you are a
01:02 - working professional or you are a
01:03 - student what should you do first thing
01:05 - second thing will you get a job as a
01:08 - student if you are a student you are in
01:09 - college second year third year finally
01:11 - year student you will you get a job and
01:13 - third thing how much time these things
01:16 - will take to get better so we'll try to
01:20 - discuss these kind of things in this
01:21 - video right so first thing let me just
01:23 - tell you recession is not a new thing it
01:26 - comes and goes right we cannot control
01:29 - these things
01:31 - so first thing you keep in mind what you
01:32 - can do what you can control is you can
01:35 - control yourself that's it right so how
01:39 - to control your
01:41 - yourself upskill yourself in this time
01:44 - during this time because everybody's you
01:48 - know almost everybody is just worrying
01:52 - about these news by listening these news
01:54 - negative news negative thoughts and
01:56 - everywhere is these kind of thing
01:58 - negativity and all negative energy
02:00 - right so what you should do you should
02:03 - be
02:04 - positive you should learn something new
02:07 - you should upskill yourself during this
02:11 - time because I guess Rec session is the
02:13 - best time to learn something new to
02:15 - learn to you know to upskill yourself
02:18 - right and we know nowadays competition
02:21 - is so so much high at this level because
02:24 - of AI and all right because of these
02:27 - Technologies so it's comp for you to
02:30 - upskill yourself if you get a job right
02:33 - and what is better time than this
02:35 - recession time if you are not obviously
02:38 - if you are the one you know you're are
02:39 - not getting a job and you are free so
02:42 - rather than worrying about the things
02:45 - right these things lay off and all you
02:48 - just focus focus on yourself and learn
02:50 - something new learn new technologies new
02:52 - tools and all upskill yourself because
02:54 - definitely things will be better after
02:58 - within one year after 6 to 12 month
03:01 - definitely and at that time if you are a
03:03 - skilled person definitely you will get
03:05 - nobody can stop you getting a good job
03:08 - that is for
03:09 - sure right so upskill yourself that is
03:12 - one thing you must do during this time I
03:14 - would recommend right because yeah it's
03:18 - very tough to stay positive during this
03:20 - time right but if you stay positive and
03:24 - if you upskill yourself you focus on
03:26 - yourself right and you keep going then
03:29 - you'll be far ahead of everybody
03:32 - else
03:34 - right so learn these things learn new
03:38 - things new technologies upskill yourself
03:41 - right now but the question is from where
03:44 - there are many free resources many
03:46 - things are available on internet right
03:48 - but if like I personally feel if there
03:51 - is a structured course or structured

06:27 - have told you earlier also this kind of
06:29 - recession these comes and goes right so
06:32 - definitely within one year after 6 to 12
06:34 - months things would be better right one
06:38 - thing definitely you will get a job but
06:40 - one thing competition is high you need
06:42 - to take care competition would be very
06:44 - high because of technology is changing
06:47 - rapidly because of these AI kind of
06:50 - things chat GPT cloudy and de right so
06:56 - competition would be very high you have
07:00 - to be you know you have to get
07:03 - updated on these recent technology
07:06 - recent Trends on these tools right so
07:10 - learn how to use these tools what are
07:13 - these tools how to use these new
07:16 - technologies use these things in your
07:18 - project or in your learning or anything
07:21 - right so if you have you know some
07:23 - experience of using these tools so your
07:26 - chances would be very high when things
07:29 - get better better or even right now also
07:31 - it's not like that it's zero hiring no
07:34 - it's only like you can say 20 to 30%
07:37 - less hiring companies are still hiring
07:39 - even in my know one of my relative is
07:42 - having three to four uh offer right now
07:45 - and he has I think joined genek right so
07:48 - companies are still
07:50 - hiring but what you have to be a more
07:54 - skilled person now competition is high
07:57 - right that thing is for sure
08:01 - earlier if you know a little bit it's
08:03 - okay Mass hiring is there and on campus

08:08 - like let's hire and let's we are going
08:10 - to train him and all right but in this
08:14 - job market in these kind of situation
08:16 - right now this is not the trend right
08:18 - now they want a trained person they
08:21 - don't want to you
08:23 - know expend they don't want to you know
08:26 - spend their money on training people
08:29 - because obviously they why are they they
08:31 - laying off to cut off their expenses
08:35 - they they are not having so much money
08:37 - or cash or fund and all
08:40 - right that is why so they are not going
08:42 - to you know uh spend their money on
08:44 - training people and all so they want a
08:46 - train people skilled people if you are
08:48 - trained if you are skilled already
08:49 - definitely they're going to hire you so
08:50 - they are still hiring just you have to
08:53 - be skilled person and just you have to
08:54 - be at right place at right time that is
