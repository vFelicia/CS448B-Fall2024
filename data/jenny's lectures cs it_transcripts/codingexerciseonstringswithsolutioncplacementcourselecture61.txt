00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:04 - C++ programming language in the previous
00:05 - video we have seen some member functions
00:07 - on strings right so theory part on
00:10 - strings is clear like we have discussed
00:12 - C style strings and C++ strings member
00:15 - functions on strings and all now we'll
00:18 - do one coding exercise based on strings
00:21 - you have done those member function and
00:23 - all so I hope you can do this easily
00:26 - right it's simple one now uh what we
00:29 - have have is we you have a name full
00:32 - name like Janti katri right but there is
00:35 - no space between this first name and
00:38 - last name so you have to reformat
00:41 - it to you know read it more easily what
00:46 - should be the output jti space
00:49 - katri okay now what you have to do see
00:53 - you have to you know remember some
00:54 - points first thing what you have to do
00:56 - is you have to declare and initialize a
01:00 - variable like first name you can take or
01:02 - any variable you can take from this
01:04 - variable from this given string variable
01:06 - full name right how to initialize this
01:09 - thing we have discussed in previous
01:11 - videos so you have to you know revise
01:14 - those videos those things first right
01:18 - next thing what you have to do now in
01:20 - the next part you have to take another
01:22 - VAR another string variable last name
01:24 - and you have to initialize this last
01:27 - name using substring method
01:31 - so in the first name you will fetch jti
01:33 - from full name in the sub uh second in
01:37 - the last name using uh substring you
01:40 - will fetch only
01:41 - katri right then you will con
01:44 - concatenate this F name and L name using
01:47 - plus operator but obviously this would
01:49 - be same as this if you will concatenate
01:52 - both J and and katri like first name and
01:55 - last name you have to insert a space
01:57 - between Janti and katri use
02:00 - using insert member function you have to
02:04 - use insert this function to insert a
02:08 - space between Janti and katri right see
02:12 - there are many ways to do this thing
02:14 - it's very simple but you have to perform
02:16 - these task to achieve the
02:20 - formatted full name right so pause the
02:24 - video and try this out so let's create a
02:27 - new file I hope you have done this
02:31 - so first we'll take a string variable uh
02:35 - full name
02:40 - right and here we
02:42 - have any name you can take right let's
02:46 - take we have Jenny's
02:57 - lectures so this is not obviously it's
02:59 - not not readable there should be a space
03:01 - between first and last name like Journey
03:03 - space lectures right so you have to
03:05 - reformat it okay first point what we
03:09 - need to do you have to take a variable
03:11 - first name this
03:15 - variable
03:18 - sorry and we will
03:20 - initialize this from the variable full
03:25 - name full name right but in first name
03:28 - what you want only gen
03:30 - KN right so what is the method you just
03:34 - write down the string variable name from
03:37 - where you want to initialize this that
03:38 - is full name and here start index from
03:43 - where you want to initialize the first
03:45 - character from where you want to take
03:46 - from which position from which index so
03:49 - from zero and next would be the length
03:53 - how many characters you want to fetch so
03:56 - length would be till s this s so 1 2 3 4
04:00 - 5 6 7 so zero and length should be
04:05 - 7 right so if you want to check
04:09 - out then you can just print this F name
04:13 - and you can check whether in in this
04:17 - name you have Jenny's or
04:20 - not see let's run this and see Jenny's
04:25 - right okay it's it is working fine now
04:28 - comment out this thing now second
04:30 - variable uh name we will take that is L
04:35 - name or last name and we will use here
04:40 - substring here we will fetch from this
04:42 - string we will fetch lectures only right
04:46 - so that we can do with subring so name
04:48 - of the that string variable full name
04:50 - dot we will call sorry not full it's
04:54 - full name full name dot sust Str and
04:58 - here you need to first two argument
05:02 - first would be same the start index and
05:04 - next would be length so start index from
05:08 - L I want
05:09 - to extract the string so lectures so the
05:14 - position of L is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 start
05:20 - index index is seven index start from
05:22 - Seven sorry from zero so L is on Seventh
05:25 - index and now next length so 1 2 3 4 5 6
05:32 - 7 8 eight characters are there in
05:34 - lecture so I eight character I want to
05:36 - fetch so this sub subring I want to
05:39 - fetch from full name from this string so
05:43 - if you want to check out you can check
05:44 - out here rather then F name we can print
05:49 - last name so it will print kri sorry
05:53 - lectures lectures right now
05:57 - concatenate F name and this
06:00 - so let's take another
06:02 - variable
06:04 - uh formatted full
06:09 - name right we have a string variable
06:13 - formatted full name so now
06:17 - formed full name equal
06:20 - to F
06:22 - name
06:24 - plus L name just
06:28 - concatenate but no
06:30 - no it will not give you the desired
06:33 - result because if you now print the for
06:36 - this formatted full
06:38 - name let's run this and see what output
06:40 - you are getting it's Jenny's lectures
06:42 - without space so what's the use of doing
06:45 - these things because as it is this
06:48 - unformatted name we are getting so
06:50 - insert a space
06:53 - first so how to insert we have an insert
06:56 - function you have to use that thing
06:58 - right we can concatenate also like plus
07:02 - and here we can do something like this
07:04 - space then plus L name this will work
07:08 - fine let me run this and show
07:12 - you see with space you got it but no no
07:16 - no you don't have to do this thing you
07:18 - have to use insert function right
07:23 - so in formatted full name this name
07:26 - formatted full name I want to insert
07:29 - let's call insert function at which
07:32 - position you want to insert only one
07:35 - like a space I want to insert so first
07:38 - you need to give the position position
07:40 - where from which index from uh at which
07:44 - position so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
07:49 - 7 right seventh
07:53 - position so it will
07:55 - insert just before this whatever
07:59 - character at the seventh position here
08:02 - just before that character it will
08:04 - insert whatever you will insert so at
08:06 - seven right now the character in this
08:08 - string is L so just before this L it
08:12 - will
08:13 - insert whatever you want to insert and I
08:15 - want to insert only a
08:17 - space so just give a space here and
08:22 - that's
08:22 - it right we can insert a complete subing
08:26 - substring also or a single character
08:29 - like we are inserting only space here
08:32 - this insert we can use in many ways
08:33 - multiple ways I hope you have done this
08:36 - right so please try out these
08:39 - functions now let's print this formatted
08:42 - full name and see Jenny's space lectures
08:47 - right
08:48 - sorry so I guess this was simple one but
08:50 - if you didn't get it take your time and
08:53 - then again watch this video try to
08:56 - understand what we are using try to
08:57 - understand first what is this sustr what
09:00 - is the insert how to use these things
09:03 - what does this initialization means
09:06 - right we are initializing this variable
09:07 - from another
09:09 - string okay so I hope you got this
09:11 - exercise uh in the next we'll see what
09:13 - are functions in C++ so now I'll see you
09:16 - in the next video till then bye-bye take
09:17 - care
