00:00 - so in the series of running Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen uh conditional
00:05 - statements like what is if what is if
00:07 - else statement and how to use them the
00:09 - syntax and all now based on that we will
00:11 - do one coding exercise now you have to
00:13 - find out that that is very simple one
00:16 - the given number is even a road number
00:18 - even number means that is divided by 2
00:20 - and with no remainder completely
00:23 - divisible by 2 like 2 is even number 34
00:27 - is even number like this right so using
00:29 - input function you need to take input
00:31 - and then you have to check based on some
00:33 - condition and all right and I hope you
00:36 - remember when operator module operator
00:38 - that will give remainder
00:40 - in arithmetic operator when we were
00:42 - discussing we have discussed this thing
00:44 - right what is modulo operator you have
00:46 - to use this thing because it will give
00:48 - remainder and obviously you need to
00:50 - check remainder if the number is divided
00:52 - by 2 and there is no remainder then that
00:55 - is an even number so let this now pause
00:58 - the video and try out this program so
01:00 - let's create a new file here and we'll
01:03 - be writing what
01:05 - coding underscore excess size 6 dot p y
01:11 - okay let's take a number
01:13 - you have to check number is even a road
01:15 - right
01:17 - number
01:18 - and while entering I'll
01:21 - convert that into int input
01:28 - enter a number
01:29 - right
01:31 - now we have a number so put some
01:32 - condition if
01:34 - this number
01:37 - mode 2 equal to equal to 0.
01:42 - colon
01:45 - print
01:47 - obviously this this is what
01:51 - this is
01:53 - even number
01:55 - right
01:56 - else
01:59 - colon
02:02 - what we will print
02:07 - this is our number
02:09 - right
02:11 - so you can put this thing in single coat
02:14 - also
02:15 - actually I am from that C plus plus your
02:18 - Java background that is why I put double
02:21 - quotes but you can use single code where
02:23 - that is also fine
02:24 - now and you can put this condition in
02:27 - bracket also that is also fine without
02:29 - bracket also all fine now let's run this
02:32 - so obviously if the number is divisible
02:35 - by 2 with no remainder
02:37 - right that is even number and remainder
02:39 - which operator will give us remainder
02:41 - module operator it will give remainder
02:44 - so if remainder is 0 then this is even
02:46 - number otherwise it is our number let's
02:47 - run this and enter a number 34.
02:52 - obviously 34 is even number so this is
02:55 - even number let me just run this again
02:59 - 33
03:01 - this is odd number because there would
03:04 - be a reminder remember there is one so
03:06 - this is our number so this is simple you
03:09 - know
03:10 - how to use if else whatever we have
03:13 - discussed in previous video that thing
03:14 - you have to put in as a in the form of
03:17 - program right
03:18 - so I hope you have done this coding
03:20 - exercise in the next video we'll see
03:21 - some more conditional statements so now
03:23 - it's in the next video till then bye
03:24 - take
