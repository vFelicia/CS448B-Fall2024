00:00 - so in the series of learning c plus plus
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have discussed features of c
00:05 - plus plus in this video we'll talk about
00:07 - history of c plus plus before moving
00:09 - further in this course at least you
00:11 - should have some you know basic idea
00:12 - about history of this language like the
00:15 - versions the latest version the
00:16 - improvement made in this language time
00:18 - by time so these things will discuss
00:20 - briefly in this video right but before
00:22 - that i just want to tell you one thing
00:24 - if you are interested in competitive
00:25 - programming then dx4 weeks has come up
00:27 - with something really exciting for you
00:28 - guys that you cannot miss out they're
00:30 - going to start a summer training batch
00:32 - from 21st of may so it is a great
00:35 - opportunity for you guys to enhance your
00:38 - skills during your summer vacations
00:40 - whether you want to be a programmer in
00:42 - top company or you wish to drop the
00:44 - charts of leading coding competitions
00:46 - you have come to write please
00:48 - a
00:49 - live weekend classroom program designed
00:51 - for the people who wish to excel in
00:53 - competitive programming and sd
00:55 - interviews so now you can learn
00:56 - competitive programming through a live
00:58 - course designed by industry experts to
01:00 - help you enhance your problem solving
01:02 - skills and prerequisite for this courses
01:04 - basic knowledge of programming language
01:06 - and basic knowledge of data structure
01:07 - and algorithm and in this course will be
01:09 - mentored by the experts and this also
01:12 - includes dsa course quizzes more
01:14 - contests and much more so what you will
01:16 - learn in this course all the important
01:18 - concepts of data structure and
01:20 - algorithms how to improve your problem
01:22 - solving skills
01:24 - various efficient techniques uh for
01:27 - competitive programming and efficient
01:29 - implementation of mathematical
01:31 - algorithms so as i have told you this
01:33 - training batch is going to be started
01:34 - from 21st of may so go and get yourself
01:37 - registered to get counseling the and you
01:39 - can use my code jenny10 to get 10
01:42 - discount for the same so the
01:44 - registration link and all the relevant
01:46 - details i'll put in the description box
01:48 - of this video you can go and check out
01:50 - now as we know c was developed by dennis
01:52 - richie in 1970 at atnt bell laboratories
01:55 - to develop unix operating system right
01:58 - so c plus plus was developed by bjornik
02:00 - straustra he was a computer scientist at
02:03 - atnt bell laboratories it was developed
02:06 - and he started working on the
02:08 - development of this language since
02:11 - 1979 1979.
02:14 - he was working on his phd you know
02:17 - thesis work
02:19 - at that time
02:20 - he you know got a chance to work in
02:22 - similar language
02:24 - similar programming language
02:28 - and similar 67 was the first
02:32 - object-oriented programming language it
02:34 - was the first language who supported
02:37 - oops concepts
02:39 - right
02:41 - so he thought that
02:43 - these concepts these oops concepts
02:46 - would be you know very beneficial
02:50 - to develop large softwares
02:52 - so these concepts he thought that can be
02:55 - used in software development
02:57 - but this language was similar language
03:00 - was
03:01 - it was used for simulation purpose and
03:03 - it was too slow for practical use
03:06 - right and that time
03:08 - c was popular language so he got a
03:10 - chance to work in c language
03:13 - so he thought to combine
03:15 - c language these oops concept in c
03:18 - language
03:19 - right
03:20 - because this was too slow sorry this was
03:24 - you know too slow for practical use
03:26 - although bcpl was a language
03:29 - it was fast
03:30 - but it was too low level programming
03:33 - language and it is not suited for
03:35 - suitable for software development
03:38 - so he chose c language why because it
03:40 - was general purpose programming language
03:42 - high level programming language fast
03:44 - portable and it was
03:45 - widely used at that time
03:47 - so he thought to combine some oops
03:49 - concept in c
03:51 - right he thought to make a better c
03:54 - language
03:56 - right
03:57 - so that's why c plus plus is known as
03:59 - extension of c or superset of c all the
04:01 - features the basic functionalities of c
04:03 - was as it is
04:05 - only he added some new concept oops
04:08 - concept so the first
04:11 - language it was not known as c plus plus
04:13 - it was known as c with glasses
04:16 - some basic features were added like you
04:18 - can say classes uh basic inheritance
04:21 - single inheritance concept default
04:23 - function argument concept inlining
04:25 - polymorphism so these concepts these
04:27 - features were added
04:29 - and it was known as c with classes and
04:31 - the first c with classes compiler was
04:34 - also released known as
04:36 - seafront
04:41 - right it was derived from the compass c
04:44 - compiler c pre was a compiler it was
04:46 - derived from that compiler and the main
04:47 - the interesting fact is what c front
04:49 - this compiler was written
04:51 - in c with classes language only
04:54 - so it was you can say self-hosting
04:56 - compiler a compiler that will compile
04:58 - itself
05:00 - but the use of this compiler was
05:01 - abandoned in 1993
05:04 - right because it became difficult to add
05:06 - new features to integrate new features
05:08 - into it so it was abandoned the use of
05:10 - this was abandoned in 1993 actually
05:13 - now it was renamed as c plus plus in
05:15 - 1985
05:18 - but it was not standardized yet and
05:21 - more features were added around this
05:23 - time like virtual functions function
05:24 - overloading the cost keyword
05:27 - a single line argument using two forward
05:29 - slash
05:30 - right
05:31 - now in 1985
05:36 - the first it was the first commercial
05:38 - version was released in 1985.
05:42 - so
05:43 - the first edition you can see the first
05:45 - edition the c plus plus programming
05:51 - language
05:54 - so in this 1985 the first edition of
05:57 - this the c plus plus programming
05:58 - language this book was released but it
06:00 - was not standardized yet and c plus plus
06:03 - was also implemented as a commercial
06:05 - product in the same year
06:07 - right means you can say it was
06:09 - made available outside of the bell labs
06:11 - first time in 1985 then in 1989 also
06:15 - some
06:16 - new features were added like protected
06:18 - and static members multiple inheritance
06:21 - these kind of features were added and
06:23 - you can see that c plus 2.0 was released
06:26 - in 1989
06:28 - then in 1990 the annotated c plus
06:31 - reference manual was released i hope you
06:34 - know the meaning of annotated it means
06:36 - like
06:36 - to add a description or to add some
06:38 - information a piece of information
06:41 - to a data or an image to describe
06:44 - about that image or that data
06:46 - right some you can say nodes these kind
06:49 - of things so that reference manual was
06:51 - released in 1990 and in the same year
06:54 - borland turbo c plus plus compiler
06:57 - you know was also released as a
06:59 - commercial product
07:01 - and the last stable release for this
07:03 - compiler was in 2006
07:05 - but still we use this compiler right now
07:08 - again
07:09 - in 1998
07:14 - the standard
07:15 - committee release the first
07:17 - international standard
07:20 - of c plus plus that was
07:22 - c plus plus 98 means
07:25 - it was standardized by iso in
07:29 - 1998 the version was known as c plus
07:31 - plus
07:32 - 98
07:34 - and standard template library was also
07:37 - included
07:38 - stl right in this version now
07:41 - again in
07:42 - 2003
07:44 - a minor update
07:46 - got released that was known as c plus
07:48 - plus zero three in which the committee
07:53 - did what they resolved
07:55 - the multiple problems
07:57 - that were there in c plus but that will
07:59 - you know that were reported in this
08:00 - standard c plus plus 98 standard so they
08:03 - fixed those you can say bugs or the
08:05 - problems and released a new update that
08:07 - was known as c plus plus
08:09 - 0 3 in 2003
08:11 - right and then in
08:14 - 2005
08:15 - the same committee the standard
08:17 - committee released a technical report
08:21 - in this report what was there
08:23 - features various new features that they
08:25 - were planning to add
08:27 - in the latest version of the c plus
08:30 - right
08:31 - they released that report
08:33 - but the next version the next standard
08:36 - were released
08:38 - in 11
08:41 - after you can say
08:43 - eight years see that previous was in
08:45 - 2003 c plus plus zero three so after
08:48 - eight years next version was released it
08:50 - was the longest interval between those
08:52 - release in five
08:54 - they obviously they released a technical
08:56 - report that they want to add these
08:57 - features and they were planning
08:59 - to release that new standard before
09:02 - 2010
09:04 - so they named that the draft as c plus
09:08 - plus 0x means before 10
09:11 - they won't they wanted to release this
09:13 - but
09:14 - because of some reason it was not
09:16 - possible
09:17 - and then
09:18 - in the mid 2011 they released a new
09:20 - version with major updates
09:23 - that was c plus plus 11
09:26 - many new features were added like auto
09:28 - keyword
09:31 - and that resistor keyword was depleted
09:33 - in 2011 right not removed but it was
09:37 - deprecated
09:38 - it was not recommended to use that
09:40 - register keyword it was replaced by
09:42 - another keyword that auto keyword
09:44 - regular expression support new libraries
09:48 - new time library so many features were
09:49 - added this was a major release 11
09:53 - lambda expressions right
09:55 - after that
09:56 - in 14
09:59 - it was not a major one it was a minor
10:01 - update release bug some bug fixes that
10:04 - was in this one and
10:06 - small improvement in c plus plus 11 only
10:09 - and it was known as c plus plus 14
10:13 - then
10:14 - in 17 again
10:16 - major release was there with that
10:18 - addition of new features and with a
10:21 - great changes in this
10:22 - version that was known as c plus plus
10:25 - 17.
10:27 - like in this they
10:29 - removed the resistor keyboard right it
10:31 - was unused and reserved that's the
10:34 - sticky one in 11 it was deprecated right
10:37 - it was removed in c plus plus 17 version
10:40 - and many new header files and libraries
10:43 - were added in this one and some obsolete
10:46 - features some things were removed
10:48 - from this this one from this version and
10:51 - this was known as c plus 17 and then
10:53 - next in 20
10:55 - c plus 20 28 is the latest version
10:59 - of this language
11:00 - next will be coming in 23 that would be
11:03 - named as c plus plus
11:05 - 23.
11:06 - like
11:07 - like in this they have added new
11:08 - features one example is they have added
11:10 - a three-way comparison operator
11:12 - this is the operator if you can write
11:16 - the this and this
11:18 - right a this operator is known as
11:20 - three-way comparison operator so many
11:22 - these kind of features were added we'll
11:25 - be discussing in detail about these
11:26 - features
11:27 - when we move in this course this is just
11:30 - a small you can say briefly we have
11:32 - discussed history of c plus i hope you
11:35 - go this
11:36 - right
11:37 - so now that's it for this video
11:39 - if i have left something you can write
11:41 - down that thing in comment box maybe
11:42 - other can get help from your comment
11:44 - right
11:46 - so now i'll see in the next video till
11:47 - then bye
