00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language the previous video
00:03 - was about randomization we have
00:05 - discussed random module how to generate
00:08 - random numbers integers floating numbers
00:11 - and all right now based on that we'll do
00:14 - one coaching coding exercise now uh it's
00:17 - like virtual coin toast program
00:21 - when you toss a coin then you will get
00:23 - either heads or tails so same program
00:25 - will write and then you will tell the
00:27 - user heads or tails now what you have to
00:32 - assume like zero means tails and one
00:35 - means heads
00:37 - so simply generate a random number
00:40 - either 0 or 1 and based on that you can
00:44 - tell heads or tails simple program is
00:46 - there I hope you got this what is the
00:48 - problem statement right now pause the
00:50 - video and try this program so I hope you
00:52 - have done this now let's create a new
00:55 - file and scoring exercise 11 right so
01:00 - simply first of all obviously you have
01:02 - to import
01:04 - random module right
01:07 - so in this case now
01:10 - generate a random number
01:13 - between or you can say either 0 or 1 so
01:16 - what you can use for that what function
01:18 - Rand hint we can use right so how you
01:21 - will use that function the module name
01:23 - Dot the function is Rand end and just
01:27 - provide
01:28 - the range 0 to 1 both 0 and 1 are
01:31 - included
01:33 - right
01:35 - so whatever it will return that we are
01:38 - going to store suppose in a variable any
01:40 - variable uh like we can say
01:43 - sign
01:45 - side of that coin right random side or
01:47 - side any variable name you can take a b
01:49 - c also find x y z right now obviously
01:53 - you have to put some condition if 0 then
01:55 - tells otherwise
01:57 - heads so we can put some condition like
01:59 - if this side equal to equal to suppose
02:03 - one
02:05 - it means
02:07 - you can simply print
02:10 - heads
02:12 - we are assuming one means heads
02:15 - else
02:19 - I hope you are familiar with this
02:22 - effects because we have discussed this
02:24 - thing how to use if else in Python
02:26 - otherwise
02:27 - things that's it this is the simple
02:30 - program right now let me just run this
02:35 - and see this time we are getting heads
02:39 - again heads
02:41 - this time you are getting Tails right
02:44 - and if you want to play to the side also
02:46 - then uh here you can print like if you
02:49 - want to check print
02:50 - side
02:52 - let's run this
02:54 - see side is one that is why heads
02:57 - right one again heads one same you are
03:02 - getting
03:03 - so it is possible that you can get more
03:06 - than one time saying now this time C
03:08 - Tails zero entails right
03:12 - so this is the simple program
03:15 - so in the next video we'll see one more
03:16 - coding exercise that would be a little
03:18 - bit complicated than this one so now I
03:20 - will say in the next video till then bye
03:21 - bye take care
