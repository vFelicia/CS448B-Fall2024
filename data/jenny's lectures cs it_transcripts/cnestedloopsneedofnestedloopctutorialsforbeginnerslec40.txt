00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - C++ programming language in the previous
00:05 - video we have seen infinite Loops now in
00:08 - this video we'll see nested Loops in C++
00:10 - what are nested loops and the important
00:12 - point is what we will see is need of
00:15 - nested Loops why we use nested loops and
00:18 - when to use nested loops with the help
00:21 - of program also I'll show you okay now
00:24 - in simple term if I say nested Loops
00:27 - means a loop within a loop that is
00:30 - nested Loop right if a loop is inside
00:33 - another loop that is nothing but nested
00:35 - Loop right if General syntax if I say
00:39 - then it's something like this nested
00:42 - Loops for Loop can be nested Loops while
00:44 - loop do while loop and these see so we
00:47 - have a for Loop here and within this for
00:51 - Loop we have another for Loop right so
00:54 - this is why what nested for Loop if you
00:58 - have y Loop that is also fine
01:00 - we have while loop here we have
01:02 - condition within this we have one more
01:04 - wi Loop right so this white Loop is
01:07 - within this while loop so this is nested
01:09 - while loop this is known as inner loop
01:11 - this is known as outer loop inner four
01:13 - Loop outer for loop it's not like that
01:15 - only two level of two level is possible
01:18 - like one Loop within another loop
01:20 - no nesting can be possible up to many
01:23 - level within this for Loop we can have
01:25 - one more for Loop within this we can
01:28 - have one more for Loop and up to many
01:31 - level right nesting is
01:34 - possible Right same with while loop same
01:37 - with do Loop and it is also possible
01:40 - within a while loop we have a four
01:42 - Loop this is also nesting it is also
01:46 - possible within a for Loop we have a wi
01:48 - Loop then within wi Loop we have for
01:51 - Loop then again we have wi Loop mixing
01:53 - of this these Loops are also possible in
01:56 - nesting right nesting of range based for
01:59 - Loop is also possible up to many levels
02:02 - any levels right now this is what
02:05 - nesting but now when to use this nested
02:10 - loops and why we use what is need of
02:12 - nested Loops see generally when you deal
02:15 - with multi-dimensional arrays like 2D
02:17 - array 3D array and these arrays then we
02:20 - use nested Loops when you draw that
02:24 - pattern printing programs star with
02:27 - alphabets or these pattern then you have
02:30 - to use nested Loops when you to deal
02:32 - with like uh data having more than one
02:35 - dimension if data is in a matrix or
02:37 - histogram or these kind of thing in a
02:39 - chart then we deal with that data with
02:42 - nested Loops right see you can say like
02:48 - these nested Loops are used basically
02:49 - for pattern printing or for displaying
02:51 - multi-dimensional data right now let's
02:54 - take a simple example then you will get
02:56 - to know the need of this Loop if you
02:57 - want to print these pack these t five
03:00 - star then simply will say either see out
03:05 - it not like that simply print here like
03:07 - star star star star
03:09 - no okay you can do this thing also this
03:12 - will give you the same result but either
03:14 - you can do that thing or you can uh put
03:18 - like something like this and five C out
03:20 - statement but that is not a good idea we
03:23 - are repeating the same thing we're
03:24 - printing star so if you're repeating
03:26 - something we use Loops here right so I
03:29 - can put something like this we have a
03:31 - full loop and we have like I is equal to
03:34 - 1 and I should be less than equal to how
03:37 - many times 1 2 3 4 five times I want to
03:39 - print less than equal to 5 and I
03:41 - ++ right within this I can print star so
03:45 - this will give you this result right
03:48 - five time the star will be printed okay
03:49 - fine now suppose I want to print this
03:53 - pattern now we have data
03:56 - in 2D more than one dimension
04:00 - previous data was in having only one
04:02 - dimension now we have two Dimension this
04:04 - and this right rows and columns you can
04:09 - say it's a matrix form of something like
04:11 - this right now I want to print this kind
04:13 - of thing
04:15 - so
04:18 - this this process is used to print this
04:22 - line this full loop right now again same
04:26 - five star I want to print same five star
04:29 - I want to print same five star I want to
04:31 - print right means basically we are
04:34 - repeating this process we want to repeat
04:37 - this process so either you can write
04:39 - down here same process like same for
04:42 - Loop here four for Loop one for this one
04:45 - for this one for this one for this but
04:47 - obviously that is not a good idea
04:48 - writing four four Loops for four lines
04:51 - no so here we use nested loops loops
04:54 - within Loop so we want to repeat this
04:58 - process again right so same whatever you
05:01 - want to repeat that thing we put in a
05:04 - loop either four while four while while
05:06 - or any Loop right so this process again
05:09 - we put in a suppose for Loop this this
05:13 - complete thing right so how many times
05:16 - this should be repeated how many rows
05:19 - are there 1 2 3 4 four times right so
05:24 - this outer loop should be repeated four
05:26 - times right so we put some something
05:29 - like this in any variable you can take
05:32 - suppose I'm taking J J is equal to 1 J
05:35 - less than equal to how many times 1 2 3
05:37 - 4 4 and J
05:40 - ++ and within this we have this inner
05:44 - for Loop right but generally in for Loop
05:47 - we say like in outer for Loop we take
05:49 - variable I for inner for Loop we take
05:52 - J I'm not saying that it is wrong you
05:55 - cannot take J here you cannot take I
05:57 - here no but generally we put something
05:59 - like this
06:00 - here we take I in for outer for
06:03 - Loop and for inner we take J it's maybe
06:07 - something like maybe J comes after I in
06:11 - alphabetic order that is why we are
06:13 - doing this but I don't know but it's not
06:16 - something like it's a rule no it's not
06:18 - any rule you can take any variable
06:20 - right now now there is one problem here
06:24 - see
06:25 - first in I so we have a variable I that
06:28 - is one this condition is true so we will
06:31 - enter here now again we have a variable
06:33 - J that is one condition true so enter
06:36 - here first star would be printed right
06:39 - now we are still in this inner loop so
06:42 - now j++ now J becomes two condition true
06:46 - again star would be printed again j++ J
06:49 - becomes three condition true again star
06:51 - would be printed now j++ J becomes four
06:54 - condition true again star would be
06:56 - printed now J becomes five condition
06:58 - true again n star would be printed now J
07:01 - becomes six is this condition true no
07:04 - now we'll be out of this inner four
07:08 - Loop right now out of this inner for
07:11 - loop after that it will go to here I ++
07:15 - now I becomes two but we want to print
07:17 - the next next these five stars in Next
07:21 - plan so after this for Loop you have to
07:25 - put a new line sln or andl after this
07:29 - four Loop but within this outer loop so
07:32 - After exiting if J is six means
07:34 - condition is not true exit from this
07:36 - four Loop so whatever you will write
07:37 - after this for Loop just after the
07:39 - statement that would be executed means
07:40 - slash and Slash and means the control
07:41 - would be here
07:43 - now now I ++ now I becomes two now
07:47 - condition true again we will enter here
07:48 - now same for I2 same would be repeated J
07:53 - 1 2 3 4 5 and five star would be
07:56 - printed right so so this is the case so
08:00 - here in these cases we need nested Loops
08:05 - but it is recommended not to use nested
08:07 - Loops actually because of the complexity
08:09 - and you know complex readability of the
08:11 - program whatever you do with nested Loop
08:14 - that thing we can also do with with
08:16 - other methods also that are more
08:17 - manageable more readable and less time
08:21 - consuming right but if it is mandatory
08:24 - to use nested Loops then you can use it
08:28 - so this is I I think you got why we need
08:31 - nested loops and what is need of nested
08:33 - loops and working of nested Loops for
08:35 - one iteration of this outer
08:38 - loop this inner loop will have how many
08:41 - iteration five iteration right so if you
08:46 - uh take a real life example of these
08:48 - nested Loop you see the working of this
08:52 - type of nested loop I hope you want the
08:54 - working right in your daily life daily
08:58 - you see
08:59 - so you can just write down the real life
09:02 - example of using this nested Loop
09:05 - phenomena this nested Loop pattern in
09:08 - comment section you just think and write
09:10 - down one thing let me just tell you we
09:13 - can take example of cloak one three hand
09:16 - one hour and minute and and second so
09:21 - this second will move the second hand
09:24 - will
09:24 - move in every 60 seconds 60 times after
09:28 - that
09:29 - after completing the 60 this minute will
09:31 - move one step like 1 minute then again
09:35 - for next minute this this this uh Second
09:38 - Hand move 60 times then again it will
09:40 - move 1 minute again it will move one 1
09:43 - minute so this is kind
09:45 - of nested Loops so let's let's do some
09:48 - practical of this nested Loop how to
09:50 - print the this kind of star okay so
09:53 - let's create a new file nested loop.
09:56 - CPP same first we will take
09:59 - that
10:01 - header then name space using name space
10:04 - s2d and in main we will uh draw that
10:09 - pattern right so in outter for Loop out
10:13 - for Loop is for you can say for the rows
10:15 - number of rows and inner for Loop is for
10:17 - number of columns in each rows so outer
10:20 - for Loop would be traded for how many
10:23 - number of rows are there in that pattern
10:24 - four right and for every Row the inner
10:28 - loop would be rated five times because
10:30 - you have to print five star so actual
10:32 - printing is done with the inner for rule
10:37 - right so I is equal to 1 and this would
10:40 - be number of rows here we have done
10:43 - hardcoded we are taking like four and
10:45 - this or you can take here like from user
10:48 - you can ask enter number of rows enter
10:49 - number of columns something like this
10:51 - right that is also
10:55 - fine so now we have another for Loop in
10:58 - J is equal to 1 and J less than equal to
11:01 - how many Star I want to print in each
11:03 - row five star so j++ and then actually
11:08 - we are printing
11:10 - here in inner loop
11:13 - Star right and after this after every
11:16 - after completing the
11:18 - iteration of inner loop five iteration
11:22 - the next for next row would be in next
11:25 - line so after this you have to put
11:27 - either endl or slash
11:31 - right and just write down return 0 for
11:33 - successful completion and let's run this
11:35 - and I'll show you the output now
11:39 - see this is the
11:41 - pattern right so like this using nested
11:46 - Loops we can do we can draw different
11:48 - different type of pattern we already
11:50 - have a playlist of pattern printing but
11:53 - that that is in C language but it's not
11:56 - you know so much different because synx
11:58 - is almost same print F here see out and
12:01 - something like this right so those that
12:04 - playlist you can check pattern printing
12:07 - playlist in C so this is the use of you
12:10 - can say nest if you want to deal with
12:13 - metrix also or we use like 4
12:17 - 43 nested for Loop right that is also
12:20 - fine that generally we do when we do
12:22 - multiplication of two matrics right I J
12:24 - K three Loops we need right that also we
12:26 - have discussed when we were discussing C
12:28 - programming language the link I'll put
12:30 - in the side button you can check out
12:31 - that video also right so any level of
12:34 - nesting is possible four four again four
12:36 - again four or here also while four four
12:38 - while do while nesting of do while
12:40 - nesting of range for Loop thing is
12:43 - possible right so it it's your
12:45 - assignment you have to do this same kind
12:47 - of things you have to draw same pattern
12:48 - with doy Loop do while loop as well as
12:52 - with Y Loop right so the the there's two
12:55 - program you have to write you can just
12:58 - uh write down that code in comment
12:59 - section so in the next video we'll see
13:01 - one coding exercise on nested Loops so
13:03 - now I'll see you in the next video till
13:05 - then bye-bye take
13:09 - care
