00:03 - asking one simple question from you guys
00:05 - have you ever dreamed of getting into
00:07 - IIT I'm sure many of you would have
00:09 - because in India we know IIT it's like a
00:12 - dream fores for almost every student to
00:14 - pursue his or her engineering right but
00:16 - unfortunately not everyone can fulfill
00:18 - this dream because between you and I
00:21 - there is J and J is one of the toughest
00:25 - competitive exams right in an interview
00:28 - even former I Delhi director said that
00:30 - it is tough and difficult J exam because
00:33 - it is framed to reject candidates not to
00:35 - select them and I'm sure many of you
00:37 - have already faced the situation I mean
00:39 - many of you have already taken this exam
00:41 - and couldn't clear it and then no IIT
00:45 - and maybe you have already given up your

01:22 - is expected in the industry or you can
01:25 - say uh your professional success in this
01:27 - technology sector so it's a micro credit
01:29 - program in computer science domain from
01:31 - DH gurukul don't worry the link you will

01:35 - can go and check out so in this program
01:38 - you will be taught by IIT professors and

02:19 - top five Cs subjects right that
02:22 - contributes in the placements of Ians so
02:25 - let me just show you the curriculum here
02:28 - mathematics for computer science
02:29 - intruction to CSN programming data
02:31 - structure and algorithm database system
02:33 - principles of computer system design and
02:35 - architecture and then project you'll be
02:37 - working on capson project so total there
02:40 - are 24 program credits you'll be getting
02:42 - after this course right and it is a

02:55 - see this is after thetion this is your
02:57 - first trimester in which you are
02:58 - learning mathematics for CS and
03:00 - introduction to Cs and algorithm right
03:02 - now after this first trimester only you
03:04 - can exit if you are not comfortable and
03:06 - you want don't want to continue rest two
