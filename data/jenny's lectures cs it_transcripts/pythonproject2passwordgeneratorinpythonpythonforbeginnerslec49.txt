00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language we have discussed
00:03 - one Loop for Loop in Python right now
00:06 - we'll be working on one project in this
00:08 - video this is our second project in the
00:10 - series one project we have discussed
00:11 - that was rock paper scissor game right
00:13 - very simple this is also not a tough one
00:16 - but you have to use whatever knowledge
00:18 - you have gained till now in the series
00:20 - you have to use all your knowledge here
00:22 - in this project and the project is you
00:24 - have to create
00:26 - you can take the password generator
00:30 - program
00:31 - right now okay before discussing this
00:34 - thing let me just show you what kind of
00:36 - output should be there for this project
00:39 - right okay so this kind of output I want
00:42 - like first it will show you welcome to
00:44 - the password generator that line or it
00:46 - is not necessary
00:48 - the next line is it will ask how many
00:51 - letters would you like in your password
00:52 - let us suppose I am entering four
00:54 - letters I want then how many symbols
00:57 - would you like uh three
00:59 - how many numbers you like like supposed
01:01 - to
01:02 - and enter see now this is my password in
01:05 - this password I am having like four
01:08 - letters small e capital s small n small
01:11 - n
01:12 - then symbols 3 symbols star this
01:16 - Ampersand and then this round bracket
01:19 - then two numbers I have Nine and Nine
01:22 - randomly it will choose any number maybe
01:25 - same number it can choose here in this
01:27 - case it is choosing the same number nine
01:28 - and nine two numbers it may be seven
01:30 - nine or one two or any numbers right so
01:33 - this kind of password this one is what
01:35 - the hard level password tough one
01:40 - easy level maybe like four letters so at
01:44 - starting it will give four letters then
01:46 - three symbols then three numbers let me
01:48 - just show you that output also okay the
01:50 - simple one is same it will ask how many
01:52 - letters would you like in your password
01:53 - suppose four then how many symbols uh
01:57 - three and numbers suppose two numbers
02:00 - see
02:01 - four numbers sorry four letters so it's
02:04 - starting it will continue give four
02:06 - letters then three symbols then continue
02:09 - three symbols then two numbers and then
02:12 - two numbers these are not it's like you
02:14 - can know these are not shuffled in
02:16 - shuffled way
02:20 - so if hacker knows at which position you
02:24 - have two numbers
02:25 - you know at what position you have
02:28 - symbols at what position you have
02:29 - letters then it would be easy for him to
02:32 - crack the password right
02:34 - so you will be working on both the
02:36 - levels first one the easy one
02:38 - this one and the next level is the hard
02:41 - level your password should be shuffled
02:43 - right
02:45 - so let's try this out now okay now
02:47 - you've got what kind of output we want
02:49 - right for this password generator
02:50 - project
02:51 - right now first one two levels are there
02:54 - easy level and hard level so first try
02:56 - with easy one
02:58 - right
02:59 - so obviously CV you have to generate
03:02 - like random numbers random numbers
03:04 - random symbols like three numbers or
03:07 - four numbers or whatever number a user
03:09 - will enter that
03:11 - much numbers right so one idea is you
03:14 - have to understand first
03:16 - the logic don't just no no go to your
03:19 - laptop and try to you know type the
03:23 - program and all first understand or
03:26 - maybe if it is possible try to make a
03:28 - flowchart so random number you have to
03:30 - generate so obviously we will use some
03:32 - random kind of things so you have to
03:33 - import random module so read about this
03:38 - thing from random what you can use with
03:40 - many functions are there what function
03:42 - is you know
03:43 - suitable for you to this for for to
03:46 - create this project right now
03:50 - you have like list of letters small ABCD
03:54 - Capital ABCD list of numbers from 0 to 9
03:57 - list of symbols some symbols are there
04:00 - you can take that list or whatever you
04:03 - want I don't know
04:05 - you can take those things you can do
04:07 - some random functions you use of some
04:10 - random functions how you will choose and
04:13 - suppose if you are choosing like
04:14 - obviously four four letters first one
04:17 - letter the second then third and fourth
04:18 - like this so you will use Loop for Loop
04:21 - we have discussed we have discussed
04:23 - range function also that also you can
04:24 - use here
04:26 - and that would be I guess if you are
04:28 - able to put together all these things in
04:31 - correct way then it would be very easy
04:33 - for you guys right so try this out pause
04:37 - the video and try this out first try
04:38 - this that easy level then go to the hard
04:41 - level okay then I'll uh we'll discuss
04:44 - the solution so I hope you have done
04:46 - this project if not it's okay you can go
04:50 - to the solution or maybe take some hint
04:52 - and pause the video and then try the uh
04:54 - try this out let's create a new file and
04:58 - we'll be naming this project too
05:01 - underscore password generator Dot py so
05:06 - obviously we'll be using some random
05:08 - functionalities random functions so
05:10 - better to import random module first
05:12 - right then we'll be having from letters
05:15 - we'll be choosing from capital or small
05:17 - letters 26 Capital 26 more than some
05:20 - numbers then symbols so let's take list
05:23 - of those letters symbols and numbers
05:25 - okay so here here I have letters the
05:28 - list
05:29 - small ABCD Capital ABCD their numbers
05:31 - from 0 to 9 and symbols these are three
05:34 - lists I am having so randomly we will be
05:36 - choosing from these list right so first
05:41 - thing is what
05:42 - it will print like
05:45 - welcome to password generator and then
05:48 - it will ask from the user how many
05:49 - numbers you want how many letters and
05:52 - how many symbols so using input function
05:54 - will be taking input like in input we
05:58 - simply write
06:00 - how many letters you want in your
06:02 - password and that thing always storing
06:04 - in a variable
06:07 - letters we cannot take letters because
06:10 - it is name of this list also
06:13 - so number of letters n underscore
06:16 - letters and whatever you will take sorry
06:21 - using input function that would be
06:23 - a string but I want that should be
06:26 - integer so let's type cast this here
06:29 - only
06:33 - end okay
06:35 - same line we will write for like symbols
06:38 - and for numbers so I'm just copying and
06:41 - pasting this line here and we'll do some
06:44 - changes
06:45 - till now we are fine right
06:48 - now we have to generate
06:51 - letters symbols and numbers from the
06:54 - list right and then first generate
06:57 - suppose I want four letters so four
07:00 - letters and then we can like ah we can
07:04 - take a empty string and add those four
07:08 - letters to that empty string then
07:11 - suppose three symbols so then three
07:14 - symbols then add suppose two numbers
07:16 - then add two numbers to that empty
07:18 - to that string and then just simply
07:21 - print that string that's it that is easy
07:23 - level so let's take a empty string first
07:28 - our name is password and this is what an
07:31 - empty string I am taking right
07:34 - now
07:35 - I want to generate for suppose four
07:39 - letters I am entering at first
07:42 - input 4.
07:44 - four letters one two three four
07:47 - so we have to use a for Loop
07:51 - like four
07:53 - a variable name variable name I'm taking
07:55 - suppose I or a b c d x y z any variable
07:58 - you can take for I
08:00 - in
08:01 - na
08:03 - do we have a function that can that can
08:07 - generate these like numbers like I want
08:09 - four letters so it can generate like
08:11 - four numbers one two three four if seven
08:13 - then seven one two three four five six
08:14 - seven it's something like this yes we
08:16 - have a range function range and we can
08:20 - give the range one two one two this time
08:24 - I want four letters right so if I give
08:27 - like 1 2
08:29 - rather than obviously four
08:31 - second time maybe I a user enter five
08:34 - letters six letters seven letter so
08:36 - obviously statically I cannot give so
08:39 - here what
08:40 - this variable we will be taking n
08:43 - underscore letters but but the problem
08:46 - is if 1 to 4
08:49 - if I am giving n letters is equal to 4
08:52 - so range function will generate 1 2 3.
08:57 - not 4 including four not four but I want
09:00 - four letters one two three four
09:02 - right
09:04 - if you are not aware about this you can
09:05 - just check out the video on Range
09:07 - function we have discussed if the N
09:10 - letters is 5 so it will generate one two
09:12 - three four
09:14 - whatever the end size the stop Point
09:18 - stop Point minus one it will generate
09:20 - so if you want to generate these four
09:23 - letters if we are giving this input 4
09:26 - then you have to give here n letters
09:28 - plus one
09:30 - so if input I am giving 4 so here one
09:32 - two four plus one one two five then it
09:34 - will generate one two three four yeah
09:36 - exactly I want
09:38 - four letters so it's okay one two three
09:40 - four
09:42 - right
09:43 - now at this point of at running time
09:46 - this rather than this it will be
09:48 - replaced with one two three four so at
09:50 - first one would be assigned to this I
09:52 - one one in
09:55 - this range one two three four yes
09:58 - condition true so now we will generate a
10:01 - random any random letter from the list
10:05 - so if you want to generate any random
10:08 - letter from the list we have a function
10:10 - choice
10:13 - if you remember that random module that
10:18 - video
10:19 - random load choice and in bracket simply
10:22 - pass that list name list name is letters
10:25 - this letters right and whatever letter
10:30 - it will produce it will generate we will
10:33 - fetch we will you know
10:35 - fetch that letter or just store that
10:38 - letter in a variable suppose yeah or any
10:41 - variable we can take
10:42 - this time
10:44 - I am taking here I am taking care
10:46 - right and then
10:49 - after generating that character just add
10:52 - that character to this password this
10:55 - empty string so just add this thing
10:59 - here password is equal to or you can say
11:03 - concatenate and simply we have discussed
11:05 - in the very first videos of my python
11:08 - series using plus we can concatenate
11:11 - in strings so password Plus
11:16 - care
11:18 - that's it
11:20 - right
11:21 - so if you simply want to print at this
11:24 - point of time what would be the password
11:27 - after generating after just completing
11:30 - one Loop only the numbers only just we
11:33 - are going to just check out like till
11:34 - now we are working fine or not or is
11:37 - there any problem or is there any error
11:38 - let's run this
11:40 - welcome to password generator how many
11:42 - letters you want suppose four
11:44 - it will ask how many symbols three how
11:46 - many numbers two
11:48 - see it will generate only one for Loop
11:51 - we have discussed till now we have
11:54 - written in our program left four letters
11:55 - so four letters are there small o
11:58 - capital M Small U capital Z and it will
12:02 - just print these four letters that's it
12:04 - now you have to generate three symbols
12:07 - two numbers and add in the string in
12:10 - just print
12:11 - I hope now this is easy for you at this
12:14 - point of time if you have got whatever
12:15 - if you have got that one for Loop right
12:19 - so
12:20 - if you have got this for Loop then
12:22 - easily you can write down those two
12:24 - remaining for Loops right
12:27 - and rather than this this line we can
12:29 - use that shorthand also the password
12:32 - plus equal to cat that is also fine
12:35 - right or rather than these two lines we
12:38 - can simply use we can simply write
12:40 - password plus equal to random road
12:42 - Choice letters ins one line also we can
12:45 - write down this thing but better to
12:47 - write down you know for better
12:48 - understanding for beginner
12:50 - for beginners it would be better to
12:52 - write down these two lines right okay
12:54 - rather than printing the password Here
12:58 - now one more for Loop
13:01 - for I
13:03 - in
13:05 - range one more for Loop
13:08 - for second thing is for symbols so range
13:11 - would be one two
13:15 - and underscore symbols plus one y plus
13:18 - one I hope you got this
13:21 - and then here same we will generate a
13:24 - character sorry
13:27 - any random symbol so we have a variable
13:32 - random sorry it's r a n d u n random Dot
13:37 - choice and simply pass
13:42 - symbols from this list we have to choose
13:45 - right and then simply we have a password
13:49 - we can simply add that character those
13:52 - characters one by one right so here
13:56 - for symbols also one Loop is for number
13:59 - so simply I am going to copy paste this
14:02 - Loop only
14:04 - for I in range third is for numbers so
14:08 - it should be n numbers plus 1 then
14:12 - rather than the list name is here should
14:15 - be numbers
14:17 - and then we will be adding the this one
14:20 - by one this character to the password
14:22 - and finally we will print now
14:27 - print password
14:29 - okay let's run this and see
14:32 - letters how many letters four three two
14:36 - C
14:37 - at starting we have four letters then we
14:40 - have three symbols symbols may be same
14:44 - two symbols are same like the opening
14:46 - but Embraces opening round bracket like
14:49 - and two numbers eight two
14:51 - but these are not shuffled
14:54 - these are in a particular order so this
14:57 - is not a tough one to crack this
14:59 - password is easy
15:01 - now if you haven't done this before at
15:05 - this point of time you got the idea
15:07 - right now pause the video and try the
15:10 - hard level without checking the solution
15:12 - right okay now
15:17 - I hope you have done this
15:18 - what we can do
15:20 - see if you have you remember that
15:24 - function Shuffle
15:26 - we have discussed a shuffle is a
15:28 - function in a random module choice is to
15:31 - choose any particular any random thing
15:35 - from any random item from the list and
15:37 - Shuffle is
15:38 - to shuffle the list
15:40 - so suppose rather than this string
15:44 - because at first here we are taking
15:46 - password as a string rather than the
15:48 - string if we have a list
15:50 - password list here we have our list
15:54 - then we can easily Shuffle that list
15:57 - using Shuffle and then we can simply
15:59 - print
16:01 - good idea so rather than taking here
16:05 - string
16:06 - let's take list
16:08 - let's take another thing password list
16:10 - and other than string we are taking
16:13 - sorry we are taking empty list here
16:16 - right
16:18 - now maybe you are thinking in using plus
16:21 - we can concatenate in string same method
16:24 - applies to a list also you can just
16:27 - generate any random character and you
16:30 - can using plus only you can simply
16:32 - concatenate to that list also so no need
16:35 - to change here plus that is fine three
16:40 - Loops would be same right so okay rather
16:43 - than here print password at this point
16:46 - of time we are printing password list
16:48 - okay let me just show you the difference
16:51 - okay four three two
16:55 - password is not defined
16:58 - okay sorry
16:59 - we are using here password but the name
17:02 - is password list at this this time we
17:05 - have updated we have changed the name
17:07 - it's password list
17:09 - here also
17:11 - password list and here also we have
17:15 - password list
17:18 - right okay I hope it works four three
17:22 - two see now we'll be having four letters
17:27 - three symbols two numbers but in a form
17:31 - of list okay now next
17:34 - next thing is Shuffle this list okay
17:40 - simply we have using for Loop also we
17:42 - can Shuffle this to methods but directly
17:46 - we are using we have a inbuilt function
17:48 - so use that one Shuffle and
17:53 - password list okay and now again print
17:58 - password list
18:00 - okay let's run the send C
18:04 - C this is first and this list is after
18:09 - shuffling see here it's out like that
18:12 - first four we are having letters first
18:14 - we are having this letter Q then we are
18:16 - having a symbol then again a letter then
18:18 - a number then letter like this so we
18:21 - have shuffled
18:23 - this list so this is I guess more secure
18:26 - password right
18:28 - now it's a list obviously but we need
18:32 - password in the form of a string just
18:35 - right so how to convert this thing
18:39 - into a string
18:41 - okay fine
18:43 - we will simply take
18:46 - a
18:48 - empty string very easy right will
18:54 - take a for Loop will be taking a for
18:57 - Loop four high or any variable name you
19:01 - can take for I in
19:04 - password list
19:07 - in that list shuffled password list
19:10 - so now password list is
19:12 - and then from the shuffled password list
19:15 - the first
19:17 - first item would be assigned to this I
19:20 - so that item in password list that would
19:22 - be obviously true so
19:25 - we will fetch that first item and then
19:28 - add that item to this empty string
19:32 - yes okay
19:33 - so how to add this password
19:37 - plus equal to or rather than I if we
19:42 - take care then that would be more
19:43 - meaningful password plus equal to cat
19:47 - that's it and after that just print this
19:50 - string password
19:53 - right okay let me show you let's run
19:56 - this
19:57 - four three two
19:59 - see first without shuffling then the
20:03 - list after shuffling then we have this
20:06 - password so rather than printing this
20:08 - list and this list you can simply print
20:10 - this this thing so I guess this password
20:14 - is a tough one to crack
20:16 - right
20:18 - see without shuffling
20:20 - in our output this was the list after
20:23 - shuffling this was the list right and
20:26 - then we have taken an empty string then
20:29 - for care in password list now at this
20:32 - point of time this is password list so
20:34 - first
20:35 - first of all the first item would be
20:37 - taken eight now eight would be assigned
20:38 - to this scare this 8 in password list
20:42 - yes condition true so control will enter
20:44 - here and password plus equal to can now
20:47 - password is equal password is now empty
20:49 - so an empty string we'll be adding the
20:51 - character in character we have eight so
20:53 - first of all eight would be added then
20:55 - next is three then three would be added
20:57 - then this address of that would be
21:00 - earlier than U then dollar
21:02 - till the end of the list all the
21:04 - character one by one would be added to
21:05 - this password and we simply print that
21:08 - password to the string now I hope you
21:10 - got the working of this thing both the
21:12 - level both the level you got easy one
21:14 - and hard one if not it's okay
21:17 - pause the video
21:19 - take the notes
21:20 - with you know on your paper dry on this
21:23 - thing and then definitely will get it
21:24 - right
21:26 - so I hope you go teach and every line of
21:28 - the program we have written to generate
21:31 - this thing for a password generator
21:33 - project right if not please don't skip
21:37 - the video and don't just jump like you
21:40 - have you have you know watched my video
21:42 - and you got this no
21:43 - maybe you can just copy paste the
21:46 - complete code on your you know with you
21:48 - know a pen and on your paper and just
21:51 - dry on that thing try to understand each
21:54 - and every line why we have written that
21:57 - line in the program what is the meaning
21:59 - of that line try to understand the logic
22:02 - you know don't just go with my words or
22:05 - my program
22:07 - dryer and at your own right so I think
22:10 - you got this this project you have done
22:12 - this project now we are done with we are
22:15 - done with two project in the series so
22:17 - now we'll see you next video till then
22:18 - bye take care
