00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen python list
00:05 - what is list why we use lists advantages
00:08 - of using list characteristics of list
00:09 - some some functions we can use with list
00:12 - like list methods right now in this
00:14 - video we'll talk about randomization so
00:17 - more specifically if I say then talk
00:18 - about random module right now what is
00:21 - randomization and why we need see in our
00:23 - daily life like when you play that uh
00:26 - any dry skin right and when you throw a
00:29 - dice then any number can be there
00:31 - between one to six
00:32 - right like we are playing Ludo or any
00:35 - other game
00:37 - but the number would be between one to
00:39 - six one and six both are included like
00:42 - one two three four five six any number
00:43 - can be there if you are playing that
00:45 - game Tetris game the block which is
00:48 - falling from you know upside which is
00:51 - completely random we cannot predict like
00:53 - it would be a t or a square or what is
00:56 - that block the next block right
00:59 - if you know what is the next block then
01:01 - definitely it would be no fun to you
01:04 - know in playing those games so that is
01:06 - what randomization
01:08 - right so same when you write these kind
01:12 - of develop these kind of games in you
01:14 - know programming programming also we
01:16 - need randomization so how you can create
01:18 - that randomization in computer
01:20 - programming in you know through your
01:22 - programs how can you write down those
01:24 - programs
01:25 - right so in Python there is
01:28 - a inbuilt module which is called random
01:31 - module you don't have to write down the
01:34 - complete code behind that randomization
01:36 - you know that maths and all behind that
01:40 - thing right so python use that mercen
01:43 - twister algorithm for
01:45 - pseudorum you know random number
01:47 - generator program algorithm right if you
01:52 - want to read then you can read that
01:54 - algorithm if you are really interested
01:56 - in going into no into that much detail
01:58 - then you can go through that algorithm
02:01 - but
02:02 - they have already created So Random is
02:05 - an inbuilt module in Python you just
02:07 - have to use it that's it if you want to
02:09 - drink coconut water so is
02:17 - someone has already done that work for
02:20 - you and you will just go to market and
02:22 - buy coconut water and you will just
02:24 - drink right
02:25 - so same here also someone has already
02:28 - done that work for you someone has
02:30 - already created random module you can
02:32 - directly use that module and you can do
02:34 - whatever you want to do you can use that
02:36 - functions whatever is there in that
02:38 - module right so there is a random module
02:41 - in Python so how you can import that
02:44 - module in your program if you are
02:46 - writing your program then you have to
02:47 - import first of all that module so what
02:50 - you will write like this import and
02:54 - random
02:56 - now this is the module now whatever
02:59 - functions are there in this module like
03:01 - uh to create a random integer or to
03:05 - Generate random floating Point number
03:07 - two if there is a sequence like a list
03:11 - or a tuple or a set from that if you
03:13 - want to choose a specific sorry a random
03:16 - number a random item sorry then you can
03:19 - there is also a specific function for
03:22 - that theme also right within that within
03:25 - a specific range if you want to you know
03:27 - pick a random number random item then
03:31 - also you can pick so these functions are
03:32 - already there in this module you can
03:35 - directly use that for those functions in
03:37 - your program and that's it you don't
03:38 - have to go you know what is behind the
03:42 - scene
03:43 - the logic the code the maths and all
03:46 - right so what we can see basically
03:49 - random
03:50 - this this module is a inbuilt module in
03:53 - Python that is used to generate
03:56 - pseudo random number not random number
03:59 - it's pseudo random numbers
04:01 - because these numbers are not you can
04:03 - say truly random these are deterministic
04:08 - right these are not truly random that is
04:10 - why we cannot use this this thing for
04:12 - you know security purpose right
04:15 - there are some functions let me just
04:17 - write down those functions first so
04:19 - these are few functions see Rand end
04:21 - function will pass to argument A and B
04:24 - it means it will return a random integer
04:26 - number
04:28 - between A and B right and these A and B
04:31 - are both are included both inclusive
04:33 - Rand range A and B this also returns an
04:37 - integer number between A and B but in
04:39 - this case what is the difference from
04:40 - this function a would be included the
04:43 - first number but B is not included
04:45 - right so here if there like a number
04:49 - would be a less than uh sorry if it will
04:52 - return a number X so that would be
04:55 - something like this
04:57 - in this range right greater than a or
05:00 - equal to a less than b or equal to B but
05:02 - here only a is included
05:05 - B is not included it would be less than
05:07 - b b is not included random this is
05:10 - module also this is function also right
05:13 - so it will return a floating Point
05:16 - number and by default the range would be
05:18 - of that floating Point number would be
05:20 - 0.0
05:22 - 2 or let me just
05:24 - write down something like this less than
05:26 - equal to X and less than 1.0
05:31 - this would be included but it is the one
05:34 - is not included it would be less than 1
05:36 - only like 0.9999 and something like this
05:39 - but not one
05:41 - so it will run a floating by number
05:42 - uniform if you want to this will later
05:44 - on a floating Point number but if you
05:45 - want to give a particular range then we
05:47 - will use that uniform function choice
05:50 - if you want to select a particular sorry
05:52 - random item from a sequence sequence
05:54 - means it can be a list or set or Tuple
05:56 - then we use this function so Shuffle
05:58 - means if you want to shuffle any
05:59 - sequence let me just show you how can
06:01 - you can use these functions in your
06:03 - program so let's create a new file for
06:06 - this
06:09 - random underscore module Dot py
06:14 - so first of all
06:16 - we have to import
06:19 - the random module then whatever function
06:22 - in that module we can use those those
06:23 - functions so import random right now
06:27 - first thing we are using Rand int
06:30 - function right
06:31 - so the range I am giving like 1 comma 3.
06:35 - and whatever it will return
06:37 - so this is this is the function right so
06:40 - how you can use this function in your
06:41 - program it's not like that directly use
06:43 - this function brand int and whatever it
06:46 - will return let me just store that into
06:48 - a variable a a is equal to this right
06:51 - and just print a
06:53 - this is not
06:59 - okay what will happen let me just show
07:01 - you right
07:04 - let's change this to current file and
07:06 - let's run this see one error the name
07:11 - Rand hint is not defined
07:15 - because this is defined in this module
07:18 - so for use for use you know to use these
07:21 - function you have to first write down
07:24 - the name of the module dot the function
07:28 - as you can see see we have just pressed
07:31 - that dot and you can see the function
07:34 - ran into Shuffle uniform random brand
07:37 - range all these function Choice choices
07:39 - many functions are there
07:41 - right all these functions
07:44 - so now let me just run this and show you
07:46 - what output you will get see at this
07:47 - time we are getting 1 so it will return
07:50 - an integer between the range of one and
07:53 - three but one and three both are
07:54 - included so you can get one also two
07:57 - also three also let me just run this
07:59 - again
08:00 - this time you are getting three let me
08:02 - just run this again this time again
08:04 - three
08:06 - three
08:07 - again one this time we are getting two
08:10 - right
08:11 - so the range you can take like one two
08:13 - seven
08:16 - in this time you are getting seven like
08:18 - this
08:19 - right
08:20 - now let me just use another
08:24 - rather than this we are using a Rand
08:27 - range function and you will see the
08:29 - difference now now a is equal to
08:32 - random module dot this Rand range
08:36 - let us just provide
08:38 - uh like
08:41 - 1 comma three same I am providing
08:45 - between 1 and 3. but here you can get
08:48 - one and two only three is not included
08:51 - one is included 3 is not included so
08:54 - let's run this so you are getting two
08:59 - this time one
09:01 - now one one again two one right but you
09:06 - are not getting three so in Rand range
09:08 - this three would not be included right
09:10 - okay now I don't want integer number I
09:15 - want the ah that floating Point number
09:18 - so this time in a I am storing floating
09:19 - Point number so Random Dot
09:23 - random
09:26 - and a module name and function name also
09:28 - so it will return floating Point number
09:29 - between 0.0 to 1.0 but 1.0 is not
09:32 - included let's just run this C
09:36 - this is the number
09:38 - let's run this again C
09:41 - again again every time you are getting a
09:43 - different number or maybe sometimes you
09:45 - can get same number
09:46 - right but most of the time you will get
09:49 - different number right but I want a
09:51 - float number in a Range like between two
09:55 - and five
09:57 - right so for that random is by default
09:59 - taking range 0 to 1. so for that we will
10:03 - use uniform
10:06 - so in the next line we are taking a is
10:09 - equal to
10:12 - random dot uniform and let's just
10:15 - provide a range between 1 comma three
10:18 - let's take the same range
10:21 - see 1.9
10:24 - this will give you floating Point number
10:27 - every time
10:29 - different number now let's
10:32 - uh take one list
10:36 - and from this list I want a random
10:38 - number
10:39 - right so so for that we will use what
10:43 - random Dot and choice
10:48 - in choice in this function we'll just
10:51 - pass the argument list l
10:54 - now let's run this and see it will print
10:57 - it is printing 90 so it has chosen this
11:00 - number this time again 56.
11:03 - again if we Run 2
11:06 - so any random item from the sequence you
11:08 - can choose right if you want to shuffle
11:11 - the list then we can just random load
11:14 - rather than choice we can use what
11:17 - Shuffle and in bracket in argument just
11:20 - pass the list right and just now print
11:22 - this list right rather than a because
11:26 - this is complete list
11:27 - so just use this and print now l
11:32 - it will Shuffle this list
11:35 - so let's run this and see
11:38 - now 89 is at first place then we got 90
11:41 - like this
11:43 - Shuffle has shuffled the items in this
11:45 - list let's run this again and this time
11:47 - you will get different thing
11:49 - right here in the documentation you can
11:52 - go like in Python documentation you can
11:55 - go this is the render module and you can
11:58 - just straight this out there are many
12:01 - function right see there are many
12:04 - functions here
12:05 - function for integer we have discussed
12:07 - this like Rand range Rand int some
12:10 - functions we have discussed like choice
12:12 - we have discussed Shuffle and this
12:15 - random we have discussed for floating
12:17 - number this uniform
12:19 - right
12:20 - so I hope you got basic idea of
12:22 - randomization random module and what are
12:24 - different functions you can use in
12:26 - Python you know we haven't discussed all
12:28 - the function you can go through all the
12:30 - functions right we have you we have
12:33 - discussed some basic functions only
12:34 - right now in the next video we will see
12:37 - one coding exercise
12:38 - in that exercise this randomization
12:40 - would be very important this topic that
12:42 - is why I have discussed this thing the
12:44 - basics of this thing only not in detail
12:47 - right so now it's in the next video till
12:49 - then bye take care
