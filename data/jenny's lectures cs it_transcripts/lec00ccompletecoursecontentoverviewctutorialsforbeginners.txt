00:00 - hello everyone i hope you all are safe
00:02 - and doing good so now let me just tell
00:05 - you one thing the which subject i'm
00:06 - going to start now c plus plus we have
00:08 - completed c so now i'm going to start
00:11 - c plus plus right
00:13 - because see yeah i have asked from you
00:15 - guys also through a poll with subjective
00:16 - start and to be honest first preface was
00:18 - java then python then c plus plus third
00:20 - number was c plus plus
00:22 - yeah i know java is one of the top or
00:24 - maybe you can say the topmost
00:25 - programming language
00:27 - which is in demand in industries i know
00:29 - very well
00:30 - but see i thought that i have completed
00:32 - c recently so it would be easy for you
00:35 - guys to grab c plus plus concept easily
00:38 - right
00:39 - so i think i should start and in our
00:41 - curriculum also in colleges like for c
00:43 - then c plus plus then java comes so
00:45 - maybe
00:46 - i would follow this order c then c plus
00:49 - plus then java
00:50 - and it would be easy for me also to
00:52 - complete it c plus plus you know as fast
00:55 - as possible
00:56 - so i you know i apologize to those who
00:58 - was waiting for java course but the good
01:00 - news is i am
01:02 - apparently i'm preparing java classes
01:04 - right
01:05 - after you know you will get familiar
01:07 - with c plus once you have completed like
01:09 - basics of c plus plus and you are able
01:11 - to written some programs in c plus plus
01:13 - then parallely we can start java also
01:15 - i'm preparing those because the thing is
01:18 - i want to complete these courses you
01:20 - know like i have completed c
01:22 - uh programming course in detail
01:24 - from basic i want to
01:27 - you know
01:28 - complete this
01:29 - course maybe any course c plus plus or
01:31 - java
01:32 - in a way that even if you don't know
01:34 - abcd of programming
01:36 - you can easily grab the concept you can
01:37 - easily understand what i'm teaching here
01:41 - right it's not like that uber rupert
01:43 - says
01:44 - so i want to you know
01:45 - go
01:46 - in deep
01:47 - like i have completed c uh course from
01:50 - basic from scratch each and every point
01:53 - i have tried my best to complete in that
01:55 - course that thing i want
01:57 - so for this thing you know for java to
02:00 - complete
02:01 - this kind of lectures for java uh
02:03 - programming language i need some time
02:05 - right that is why i'm preparing
02:07 - parallelly java classes maybe after some
02:09 - time we can start parallely c plus plus
02:11 - and java but right now i'm going to
02:12 - start c plus plus
02:14 - and
02:15 - i will try my best to complete it
02:18 - in detail i'll keep it as a beginner
02:20 - friendly course like if you don't know
02:22 - anything abcd of coding then you can
02:25 - easily grab the concept right
02:28 - so now what i'm going to cover in this
02:31 - i'll just give you an overview not in
02:33 - detail i'm going to tell you or just
02:35 - give you the overview what we are going
02:36 - to cover in this course right let's see
02:39 - so
02:40 - this is what we are going to cover the
02:43 - main main topics i have written over
02:45 - there firstly we will see the basics
02:48 - right like see as you know c plus plus
02:50 - is object oriented programming language
02:52 - not purely but yeah it is
02:54 - why so because it follows the object
02:56 - oriented programming those uh concept
02:59 - abstraction polymorphism encapsulation
03:02 - classes and objects these concepts so
03:04 - what is this op object oriented
03:06 - programming and how it is different from
03:08 - like procedural oriented programming or
03:11 - functional programming that basic will
03:13 - see and how it is different from c
03:15 - language right then we'll see the one c
03:18 - plus plus program we will write simple
03:19 - program just to print out maybe in every
03:21 - language first program we generally
03:23 - write is hello world to print hello
03:24 - world so maybe that program will print
03:26 - or any simple program you can
03:28 - uh take so you'll see the structure of
03:30 - that c plus plus program
03:32 - right
03:33 - then
03:34 - the basic things like what is data type
03:36 - variables keywords identifiers as we
03:39 - have discussed in c language also every
03:41 - language obviously is having its own
03:43 - keywords and these things so we'll be
03:45 - seeing that thing then operators
03:48 - then we will see control structure like
03:50 - fl's and loops
03:52 - with the help of program
03:55 - each and every concept will see the help
03:56 - of programs then functions especially
03:58 - what is in line function right and
04:00 - overloading yes the new concept and say
04:03 - like what is function overloading what
04:04 - is inline function that will see after
04:06 - that
04:07 - comes to the oops concept classes and
04:10 - objects
04:11 - maybe you will see
04:12 - you know
04:13 - overview of these concept classes and
04:15 - objects inheritance encapsulation
04:17 - abstraction polymorphism in first class
04:19 - then we will see in detail like in
04:21 - classes and objects also in detail with
04:23 - the help of programs what are access
04:24 - specifier and all we will see
04:26 - how to create a class how to create
04:28 - objects how to access the members or the
04:30 - you know
04:31 - class club members of these classes with
04:34 - the help of object everything we'll see
04:36 - and i'll try to relate these things with
04:38 - them with real life examples i'll try my
04:40 - best
04:41 - then constructor destructor types of
04:42 - constructor default constructor
04:44 - parameterized constructor how to write a
04:45 - constructor what is copy constructor
04:47 - will see all these things and as well as
04:49 - constructor overloading
04:50 - what is use of constructors then
04:52 - inheritance types of inheritance with
04:54 - their programs and polymorphism friend
04:56 - function
04:57 - friend class
04:58 - pointers virtual function virtual class
05:00 - we'll see then concept comes of file
05:03 - management
05:04 - then
05:05 - you know exception handling which is not
05:06 - in c
05:07 - after that templates what is stl
05:11 - standard template library because of
05:12 - this let's see we know that c plus plus
05:15 - is
05:15 - fast way faster than
05:18 - python and
05:19 - then java also
05:21 - because of templates we can use
05:22 - templates to write down code so that
05:24 - would be one reason why c plus plus is
05:26 - fast i'll i'll discuss all the reason
05:29 - why c plus plus is fast we'll see
05:31 - properties of c plus plus also when
05:33 - we'll discuss the basics of uh you know
05:35 - this
05:36 - thing right then still standard template
05:38 - library this is i think
05:41 - one of the best feature in c plus plus
05:43 - tender template library
05:46 - uh because
05:47 - those who you know do competitive
05:49 - programming they know
05:51 - how to use this and what is the use of
05:53 - standard template library so we'll see
05:55 - about this this is what standard
05:57 - template library and
05:59 - see as we know that
06:00 - versions of c plus plus programming
06:03 - right i think recent is c plus 20
06:07 - and 23 will be coming in 23 stable
06:10 - releases c plus plus 20
06:12 - c plus plus 11 was one
06:15 - in this version lambda expression they
06:18 - have added so we'll see those thing also
06:20 - that updated thing
06:22 - that modified thing or the newly added
06:24 - thing which have been added in the newer
06:26 - versions right but the basics in every
06:28 - version is same obviously
06:30 - so what new features they have added we
06:32 - will also see that thing like lambda
06:33 - expression anonymous function we know
06:36 - that now function without name
06:38 - that our lambda expression and c plus
06:40 - plus 14 what what functions
06:42 - what i know new things they have added
06:44 - there c plus plus and 17 then 20 so in
06:48 - every version we will discuss the
06:50 - history also i'll you know discuss the c
06:53 - plus history
06:54 - so i'll try to complete i'll try to keep
06:57 - it beginner friendly
06:59 - right as simple as possible
07:01 - with real life example i'll explain with
07:03 - programs practical also we'll see
07:06 - now which id i'm going to use that is vs
07:08 - code
07:09 - there are many ids you can use it's not
07:11 - like that vs code you have to use code
07:13 - blocks is there and dave c plus plus is
07:15 - there netbeans eclipse you can write cps
07:17 - program in eclipse also vs code is also
07:20 - there many ids are there but i will i
07:22 - know uh use this id
07:25 - and how to install this how to
07:28 - set up the compiler how to install the
07:29 - compiler because this is just an id to
07:31 - write down the programs we need a
07:33 - compiler to compile those programs and
07:35 - run so separately we
07:37 - need to install that compiler we need to
07:39 - set up something right so that also we
07:42 - can see in next video so and if you know
07:45 - like how to install this or maybe you
07:47 - can
07:47 - be ready with
07:49 - install everything like vs code and
07:51 - compiler and set up the path variable
07:53 - environment variable and all right or
07:55 - maybe we can discuss this thing in next
07:57 - video right
07:59 - so with the theory it's very important
08:00 - like you have to do practice also
08:02 - i'll try to give
08:04 - a practice problem in every
08:06 - lecture after every lecture and we'll
08:08 - see the solution also in next lecture
08:10 - i'll try my best to do this thing to
08:11 - implement this thing in this course
08:13 - right some quizzes
08:15 - i'll give some questions also we'll
08:17 - discuss
08:19 - right
08:20 - for every concept some complex question
08:23 - basics question moderate questions on
08:25 - every concept we are going to discuss
08:27 - with solution
08:28 - some programs also
08:30 - so i'll try my best
08:32 - to keep this course
08:34 - simple also i'll try my best to cover
08:37 - basics to advanced level concept right
08:40 - from scratch in simple language i'll try
08:43 - this thing
08:45 - right
08:46 - so get ready with all your weapons for
08:48 - this battle right so that's it for this
08:50 - video now and i'll see the next video
08:51 - till then bye take care
