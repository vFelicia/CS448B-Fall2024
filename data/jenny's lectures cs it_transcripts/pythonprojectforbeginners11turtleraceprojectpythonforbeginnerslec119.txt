00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language we are
00:04 - discussing Turtle Graphics in the
00:06 - previous video we have seen one coding
00:07 - excise based onal Graphics right so now
00:10 - it's time to make a project based on
00:13 - this see till now we have seen only what
00:16 - one turtle on our screen so maybe this
00:19 - question has been arised in your mind
00:21 - also like can we have more than one
00:23 - Turtle the force we can have so in this
00:27 - video we are going to make a project of
00:29 - you you can say it's kind of turtle
00:32 - race right and at last it will show who
00:35 - the the winner right let me show you
00:38 - what kind of thing I want so whenever
00:40 - you run that project it will ask first
00:43 - of all how many turtles you want to
00:45 - raise like obviously a
00:47 - range any range you can take obviously
00:49 - one Turtle if there is one Turtle there
00:50 - would be no race so at least two turtle
00:52 - and maximum we can take five seven 8 10
00:54 - 15 many turtles so 2 to 10 let's take
00:58 - only three Turtles okay whenever you
01:01 - will
01:03 - enter so there is a screen having three
01:07 - Turtles right and they are going to move
01:10 - at some I don't know at which speed or
01:13 - how you going to implement I don't know
01:15 - but every turtle is having
01:17 - see different color one is red green
01:22 - this one is I guess pink or something
01:24 - like this and at last the
01:28 - winner after reaching to here to this
01:32 - line it will show the winner is pink
01:35 - color turtle or something like this you
01:37 - can
01:39 - show right so this thing you have to
01:44 - implement right now just pause the video
01:47 - and maybe you can try this out or if you
01:51 - are not able to do the complete project
01:53 - at one time so let's divide this thing
01:57 - like how to first you just have to uh
01:59 - work on the this thing how many turtles
02:01 - you want this thing how you are going to
02:03 - input how you going to take user input
02:05 - so this thing work on this thing then
02:07 - have to create multiple Turtles till now
02:09 - we have created one Turtle only so do
02:12 - that part create try to create multiple
02:15 - turtles Right obviously that those would
02:17 - be by default of same color black color
02:20 - after that try to change the color of
02:22 - those Turtles right then move the turtle
02:25 - because at first Turtle would be here at
02:27 - the center of the screen at 0 coordinate
02:29 - so you have to move these three Turtles
02:32 - here right facing upward so this thing
02:36 - now you need to do next part is now
02:39 - think of moving these Turtles
02:42 - further right at random speed and then
02:47 - finally how to reach how you will get to
02:50 - know that the turtle has reached to the
02:53 - finished line this thing you need to
02:57 - take care right you have to think and
02:59 - then whatever the color of that turtle
03:01 - you have to return right one more thing
03:03 - you need to take care here is here we
03:05 - have three turtles so these are see at
03:07 - equal spacing right from the border as
03:10 - well as in between these Turtles there
03:11 - is equal spacing if I see let me show
03:14 - you if I run this again and this time I
03:18 - enter five Turtle so
03:22 - see we have five turtle at equal spacing
03:26 - right so Winer is red color like this so
03:30 - the spacing also how you are going to
03:32 - allocate this is important one I guess
03:35 - this is complex also if you are you know
03:39 - good in mathematics in these XY
03:42 - coordinates right in understanding these
03:45 - coordinate system and in maths if you're
03:47 - good then easily you can do this spacing
03:49 - kind of thing equal
03:51 - spacing right from the border as well as
03:54 - in between the turtle right so you can
03:57 - just pause the video and try this out so
04:00 - we are going to create a new project
04:02 - right Turtle
04:04 - uncore
04:06 - race fine and now under this project
04:10 - let's create a new file and that would
04:13 - be only one file suppose main. py that's
04:16 - it right okay first thing we will do how
04:21 - to take input from the user you know you
04:24 - have an input function so let's take a
04:26 - variable suppose count and or any
04:29 - variable you can take
04:30 - and how many total you want to
04:32 - participate in the race right so let's
04:37 - just convert this into obviously you
04:40 - have to convert this into int because
04:43 - whatever you will take using input
04:46 - function that would be considered as
04:47 - string so let's take this it into
04:51 - convert this into int now you have to
04:52 - check maybe if these this count is not
04:56 - between 2 and 10 then
05:00 - ask again right so so if this count is
05:05 - within the range then you can either
05:07 - print or let's return count okay so
05:11 - let's define this thing in a let's take
05:14 - a function def number of
05:18 - totals see you can write down the code
05:21 - without any without function or all
05:23 - simple line by line but to manage the
05:26 - code or to look or code better better to
05:28 - use some function functions so that like
05:30 - this function is for number of total
05:32 - this function is for the race this
05:34 - function is for this so that we can
05:36 - easily manage our code and if any other
05:38 - is going to you know look at our code
05:41 - going to read our code then it would be
05:43 - understandable for them also okay this
05:46 - function number of turtle okay this is
05:47 - going to you know find out or this is
05:49 - going to find out or Define the number
05:50 - of turtles like this so better to use
05:53 - these approaches to look our C better
05:57 - right so let's define a function number
05:59 - of t
06:00 - and if this is within the range then
06:02 - return count right
06:06 - else sorry
06:08 - else let's just print a message input is
06:11 - not in the given range and try again
06:13 - right so try again try again means it
06:17 - should again Ask how many turtles you
06:19 - want to
06:20 - participate right so we are going to put
06:23 - this thing in a while
06:26 - loop how many
06:28 - time you know how many times this this
06:31 - is going to be asked from the user how
06:33 - many Turtle you want to participate in
06:34 - the race we don't know how many times
06:35 - because once you run this you will enter
06:38 - suppose one so again it will ask now you
06:41 - enter 11 again it will ask now you enter
06:44 - maybe 50 again it will ask so as long as
06:48 - you enter
06:49 - invalid input it is going to ask you so
06:52 - we don't know the number of iteration so
06:54 - here if you don't know the number of
06:55 - iteration then better to use their while
06:58 - loop
07:00 - so while true and this and if you to
07:03 - make sure count is at least at first
07:06 - zero so just initialize this with zero
07:09 - right else this and again while is true
07:11 - so it is going to again repeat this
07:15 - thing and if the count is within the
07:16 - range then it is going to return count
07:18 - and out of this function right so to
07:22 - execute this function you have to call
07:23 - this function so it is going to and uh
07:26 - you
07:28 - know a return number of turtles return
07:31 - the count so let's take a variable
07:33 - Turtles and let's call this function
07:35 - number of turtle here right and if you
07:37 - want to print then you can print here
07:42 - Turtles see no do not take only Turtle
07:45 - because turtle is name of the module so
07:49 - please don't take variable name turtle
07:50 - turtles is fine so let's run this and
07:53 - see okay one thing is it asking how
07:56 - manys you want to participate in the
07:57 - race and I'm entering here suppose one
08:00 - input is not in given range try again so
08:02 - again it is asking suppose 89 again it
08:06 - is asking this time suppose
08:08 - three that's it because we have
08:10 - implemented this thing only okay one
08:12 - part is done now create number of
08:15 - turtles how many Turtle whatever Turtle
08:17 - you will enter those much
08:19 - turtle you have to create right so how
08:22 - to create Turtle first let's
08:27 - import from Turtle module
08:31 - we are going to import Turtle class
08:33 - because we have to create objects
08:35 - obviously using this op approach only we
08:37 - can create multiple objects we can have
08:39 - multiple turtles in one screen right and
08:42 - let's create our own screen as well so
08:45 - our screen class we have
08:50 - right and definitely here we
08:53 - need a random kind of thing also so
08:57 - let's import random module also right
09:00 - okay now if you want to create a turtle
09:03 - suppose
09:07 - to so this is the syntax right to Turtle
09:12 - this then we want to move this Turtle
09:15 - first of all change the direction left
09:18 - 90° so Tom dot left to the angle
09:23 - 90° and then where you want to move this
09:26 - Turtle Tom Dot
09:29 - see if you have this screen right and
09:34 - suppose we know the measurement of the
09:35 - screen 400 width 400 height let's
09:38 - suppose if you know the width and height
09:42 - then easily we can play with these
09:43 - coordinate system right so first of all
09:46 - better to set width and height so let's
09:50 - take some
09:53 - constant 400 comma 400 both the things
09:57 - width and height 400 400 right so one
10:01 - more thing we need to do let's create a
10:03 - screen as well after checking the turtle
10:07 - before creating Turtle let's create a
10:09 - screen S1 equal to screen right and I
10:14 - also set the by default the size of the
10:17 - screen is 400 and 300 so we want to set
10:19 - 400
10:20 - 400 so let's
10:24 - set so see we have a method specific to
10:28 - screen setup method
10:30 - right set the size and position of the
10:32 - main
10:33 - window right so you have to give width
10:36 - and height or you can also give like
10:39 - start X and start y just to set the
10:42 - position also but we will just give two
10:44 - thing only width and height right so
10:47 - first was width and second was height
10:50 - 400 comma 400 or rather than these
10:52 - positional argument you can give keyword
10:54 - argument also like width is equal to 400
10:56 - height is equal to 400 to you know make
11:00 - it more
11:01 - understandable so this is width this is
11:04 - height of our screen it's small S
11:08 - one so suppose we have a screen this 400
11:12 - 400 and by default at first a turtle
11:15 - would be here at 0 0 coordinate right so
11:19 - this this is what y AIS and this is what
11:23 - xais right so here we have 0 0 so this
11:26 - side we have this coordinate would be
11:29 - xais is 200 + 200 here we have + 200 and
11:35 - this side we will be having Min - 200
11:37 - this side -
11:43 - 200 same this coordinate here Y is + 200
11:47 - this side and here Y is - 200 the total
11:51 - is here so let's first we are going to
11:54 - tilt turn the left uh turn this Turtle
11:56 - to left 90° and then we are going to
11:58 - move the Turtle here here so here at
12:02 - this
12:03 - boundary y would be same if we have
12:06 - three Turtle then one Turtle would be I
12:08 - want to place here one Turtle here and
12:12 - next here at equal spacing and equal
12:14 - spacing
12:15 - from the border also right so for both
12:19 - the three turtles if suppose we have
12:20 - three Turtle then x coordinate is
12:23 - changing and y coordinate is -00 only
12:27 - because here Y is - 200 only I hope you
12:30 - know XY coordinate coordinate system a
12:33 - little bit idea of this thing right but
12:35 - why is changing suppose if we have three
12:38 - Turtle then this is complete this is
12:41 - width is 400 so this horizontal is xais
12:44 - so we are going to divide this into 1 2
12:48 - 3 four parts if three Turtle then divide
12:51 - this into four parts to put these turtle
12:53 - in equal spacing in between the turtle
12:56 - as well as from
12:57 - the boundaries if you divide this into
13:01 - three parts then something like this one
13:05 - then two then three part so one Turtle
13:08 - would be here one Turtle would be here
13:10 - and one Turtle would be here one turtle
13:12 - is at this border only but we don't want
13:14 - this thing you want spacing from border
13:16 - also so if three Turtle then divide this
13:19 - into four part if you have five Turtle
13:21 - then or four Turtle then one Turtle we
13:23 - are going to place here one here one
13:27 - here and one something like here
13:29 - in that case this would be divided into
13:31 - five part 1 2 3 4 five five part so four
13:34 - total divide this into five part so I
13:38 - hope you got this point you have to
13:40 - divide this spacing X spacing between
13:44 - the turtle because this is
13:46 - x-axis for this spacing would be equal
13:51 - divided this this width divided by
13:55 - number of total + one three total then
13:58 - divide this into four part four total
14:00 - divide this into five part for equal
14:02 - spacing right I hope you got this thing
14:05 - and after that just change x
14:08 - coordinate and y coordinate would be fix
14:11 - now how to decide that x coordinate that
14:13 - also I'll show you so first let's
14:16 - suppose like
14:18 - uh X
14:24 - spacing that spacing that would be
14:27 - whatever the width
14:29 - divide by or let's take flow division
14:32 - because this is going to or it is
14:33 - integer division it's going to round
14:35 - that answer to the whole number so flow
14:39 - division
14:41 - by number of turtles plus one so number
14:44 - of turtle are in
14:45 - this variable
14:48 - turtles so Turtles
14:51 - plus
14:53 - one but you have to put this thing into
14:56 - bracket so this is X speed
14:59 - faing
15:01 - right this thing I hope you
15:04 - got okay now let's create many turtles
15:08 - so how many Turtle you want to
15:11 - create whatever Turtle you will enter
15:13 - those many turtles right so for that
15:16 - obviously we need a for Loop so
15:21 - four suppose I
15:24 - in
15:27 - Turtles Turtle says suppose I have
15:30 - entered three so here sorry this should
15:35 - be what obviously
15:36 - range and turtles or range we will take
15:41 - from one
15:42 - to if you take one two turtles suppose
15:45 - we have three turtles so 1 2 3 so it
15:48 - will generate only 1 comma 2 because
15:52 - whatever the last minus one range is
15:55 - going to generate but we want three
15:57 - turtle so if you enter three total it
16:00 - will generate only one and
16:01 - two two numbers so here you have to do
16:05 - plus one also to generate the number
16:09 - equal to the number of turtles so 1 2
16:12 - Turtle + 1 if you take this from Zer
16:15 - then you can take 0 two turtle that is
16:17 - fine so 0 1 2 if you have three Turtles
16:20 - right but why we are taking one that
16:22 - also I'll show you right so here we are
16:26 - going to create Turtle now
16:29 - right so rather than giving a specific
16:33 - name to the
16:34 - total because every turtle is like
16:37 - something different and we are going to
16:39 - make a list of turtles so first let's
16:46 - create Turtle underscore list let's
16:49 - create an empty list Turtle uncore list
16:52 - and let's what we'll do create a totle
16:55 - upend to the list create a totle upend
16:57 - to the list right so rather than giving
17:01 - a specific name new better to take new
17:05 - Turtle new turtle is equal to Turtle
17:08 - right and let's create shape also soorry
17:11 - change the
17:13 - shape
17:14 - to
17:20 - turtle and now have to set these two
17:25 - equal spacing so new turtle dot if you
17:31 - want to move a turtle from that z0
17:33 - location to any other location we we
17:35 - know we have a function go to or set
17:37 - position or set P so you have to give
17:40 - only XY coordinates see y coordinate is
17:42 - same it's -00 for all the turtles so-
17:46 - 200 means whatever the height because
17:49 - this vertical line is y coordinate
17:51 - whatever the height divide by
17:54 - two or if you want to put the uh these
17:58 - Turtle a little bit you know at some
18:02 - distance from this line because if you
18:06 - put at the edge of the screen then maybe
18:08 - half turtle would be not visible to you
18:11 - right so we can do
18:14 - like y coordinate would
18:16 - be first we will decide y coordinate so
18:19 - y coordinate is in minus because we are
18:21 - downward from zero to downward so that
18:24 - is minus so minus whatever the height
18:28 - flow
18:30 - division um
18:32 - two because divided by two height 0 to
18:36 - half up half down so divided by
18:40 - 2
18:42 - plus plus 10 or 20 pixel up from that
18:46 - boundary if you want to give you can
18:48 - give plus like 10 pixel or if you take
18:51 - minus height divid by 2 that is also
18:53 - fine- 200 also you can take that is also
18:56 - fine right so this is is y coordinate I
18:59 - hope you got this is y coordinate y this
19:01 - is y coordinate
19:04 - now x coordinate how to decide x
19:07 - coordinate if we have three Turtle
19:10 - then something like this 1 2 3 three
19:14 - Turtles would be there so y coordinate
19:16 - for all the turtle is- 200 but x
19:18 - coordinate for this turtle is if you
19:20 - think if you you know assume or if you
19:25 - figure out this thing then it would be
19:27 - around like -
19:30 - 100 right and y coordinate is -
19:35 - 200 for this x is 0 and Y is - 200 for
19:40 - this x is 100 and Y is
19:45 - -200 for equal spacing obviously and
19:48 - because this complete is 400 xais is 400
19:53 - right so this is zero this is almost in
19:55 - between this 200 so minus 100 this is
19:58 - 100 so this spacing is
20:02 - important the spacing is
20:04 - 100 because if you have three Turtle
20:07 - then how to how to find out the SP X
20:11 - spacing that width is 400 this width is
20:17 - 400 divide by flow division by number of
20:21 - total plus one so divide by 4 3 + 1 is 4
20:24 - so it would be 100 so the spacing is 100
20:27 - 100 100
20:28 - 100 if you have four
20:31 - total then it would be divided by five
20:35 - and the spacing would be
20:37 - 80 so one total would be here something
20:40 - like
20:40 - this second third and fourth like this
20:45 - it would be like it it's at - 120 x
20:48 - coordinate for this totle it's - 40 x
20:50 - coordinate for this totle 40 for this
20:52 - turle 120 like this right so how to
20:56 - decide this x coordinate
20:59 - the
21:01 - width IDE by 2 right
21:06 - plus plus obviously spacing is important
21:10 - for this then plus this spacing x
21:12 - coordinate plus this spacing next x
21:14 - coordinate for the turtle plus this
21:18 - spacing this coordinate so obviously you
21:20 - have to do plus some spacing but
21:23 - spacing you have to multiply that
21:25 - spacing with the number of total for
21:28 - first second third fourth C something
21:31 - like
21:32 - this and that would be
21:34 - minus width Flor
21:38 - division it's
21:40 - two
21:42 - plus whatever the
21:45 - turtle the number of turtle 1 2 3 4 so
21:49 - at first we have first turtle in I we
21:52 - have first so here we will take I that
21:55 - is why I have taken here I sorry one two
21:58 - Turtle plus one not 0 two turtles
22:00 - because if you take zero at first it
22:02 - would be zero and I would be zero but
22:04 - there is no zero turtle turtle would be
22:06 - 1 2 3 4 like this so if you take a zero
22:10 - Turtle then that that the this side of
22:14 - turtle the uh this side Turtle would be
22:18 - here but I don't want to place this at
22:20 - this boundary with some spacing here I
22:23 - want to place that is why I'm taking
22:25 - first at first one first second third
22:27 - four not zero so
22:30 - I into whatever the X
22:35 - spacing right let's multiply
22:41 - this so see if if the turtle is see
22:46 - width is let me just show you this
22:51 - thing x coordinate for first Turtle so
22:54 - width is 400 so - 400 floor divide 2
23:00 - then plus I is 1 for first Turtle into X
23:05 - spacing is what 100 if the total are
23:09 - three the X spacing is 100 so 100 so if
23:14 - you calculate this thing then -200 + 100
23:17 - it would be - 100 so for first Turtle x
23:20 - coordinate is- 100 that's exactly we
23:22 - want for second Turtle rather than one
23:25 - now at I we have two - 200 + 200 second
23:29 - turtle is that for x coordinate is zero
23:32 - y coordinate is same - 200 that's
23:34 - exactly want for third Turtle into three
23:37 - so - 200 + 300 it's + 400 so 100 and -
23:42 - 200 that's exactly we want 100 - 200
23:46 - right so this is the formula to
23:48 - calculate x and y coordinate if you're
23:51 - not getting this pause the video and
23:53 - just write down this formula just on a
23:56 - pen and paper just draw XY coord take
23:58 - the screen and dry run this thing
24:00 - calculate the spacing and width XY
24:02 - coordinate for taking different
24:04 - different number of Turtles 3 4 5 six
24:06 - something like this then definitely you
24:07 - will get it right it's simple math okay
24:11 - now if I run this let's run this how
24:14 - many
24:16 - Turtle
24:18 - three so we have a screen okay obviously
24:22 - you have to hold the
24:24 - screen so for that at last you will be
24:27 - S1 do exit on click okay let's run this
24:33 - how many total
24:35 - three
24:39 - see
24:41 - so let's
24:43 - just make the screen something like this
24:46 - then you will get it so 1 2 3 turtle at
24:49 - equal spacing so you don't want to draw
24:51 - this line so what we can do pen up we
24:54 - can do very simple so before moving just
24:57 - do new turtle dot pen up that's
25:10 - it let's suppose we have six Turtle this
25:17 - time let's run this and we have six
25:19 - Turtle this time so this is the
25:22 - screen okay now we have six
25:26 - Turtle but you will see like here from
25:29 - the boundaries we have more spacing so
25:32 - this is because I'm just increasing the
25:36 - this uh size of this screen by just
25:40 - dragging this something like this but
25:42 - actual screen size is here only 400 by
25:46 - 400
25:48 - right okay this thing we know uh sorry
25:51 - we have done now the colors of the
25:53 - turtles so let's take colorless
25:56 - colorless first so we have a color list
25:59 - I'm having some color at least 10 color
26:01 - you need because maximum total you can
26:03 - take is 10 so at least 10 colors you
26:05 - need right so let's take a color list of
26:08 - 10 colors and now you have to so new
26:11 - turtle dot color we can take from the
26:16 - color list and according to the because
26:18 - that is a list so we can access with the
26:21 - help of Index right so index just
26:24 - provide I value so if the turtle are
26:26 - three then 1 2 and three would be
26:29 - generated at first in I we have one so
26:32 - colorless one colorless one is red sorry
26:35 - one is
26:37 - green because the list index would be
26:40 - started from zero so if you want to take
26:41 - this zero also then you can take i -
26:45 - one so I at first would be 1 so 1 - 1 is
26:48 - zero so first would be red then I is two
26:52 - then 2 - 1 is one then second toal would
26:54 - be green third toal would be pink or
26:56 - randomly you can also choose random dot
26:58 - choice and in bracket you can just give
27:00 - color list that is also fine so let me
27:03 - just show you run this and let's take
27:05 - suppose six
27:09 - Turtle
27:12 - see you have seen the color of the
27:14 - turtle according to here first was red
27:16 - then green then pink yellow like this
27:18 - right now we are going to move these
27:22 - Turtles randomly with some pixels I
27:25 - don't know because some turtle is moving
27:27 - moving fast some are moving slow so
27:30 - maybe some turtle one turtle is moving
27:33 - with one pixel at one time another is
27:36 - moving with five pixel one is moving
27:38 - with six pixel like this so randomly you
27:41 - have to decide that distance it's not
27:44 - like that just do new turtle do forward
27:47 - with some specific uh that uh pixel 1 2
27:51 - 3 10 20 no randomly you have to choose
27:54 - so the distance would be
27:56 - random right okay
28:00 - so this for Loop is fine till now we are
28:03 - done so out of this for Loop directly
28:06 - you can write down the racing logic or
28:10 - you can just Define a function
28:13 - race that would be better if you define
28:15 - a function the code would would be more
28:19 - organizable right manageable So Def race
28:22 - let's find
28:24 - out
28:26 - distance is equal
28:29 - to I want to Generate random dot in what
28:33 - range Rand range one to suppose 20 1 to
28:36 - 20 pixel any number 1 to 20 any number
28:40 - that would be distance right and now
28:44 - this Turtle would be moving by this
28:46 - distance so like turtle or
28:50 - dot dot forward by this distance right
28:53 - all the
28:54 - turtles fine so obviously you have to
28:59 - put this thing into a loop right so for
29:02 - turtle in this Turtle list right because
29:06 - obiously we can iterate a list that is
29:08 - why we have created a list and we have
29:10 - appended all all the turtle to this list
29:12 - right so for turtle in this Turtle list
29:17 - let's find out the distance
29:19 - here random do Rand range by this and
29:22 - then that
29:26 - turtle dot
29:31 - forward with this distance with that
29:36 - random number right something like
29:40 - this but when to stop so you have to
29:43 - call this race function to execute this
29:46 - so let's call this race function but we
29:50 - want this to
29:52 - be continued till that Finish Line right
29:57 - so we just take a while loop because we
29:59 - don't know the exact number of iteration
30:01 - while true right or we can just me uh
30:05 - take a flag variable as race on is equal
30:10 - to True at first it's true
30:15 - right so while is race
30:18 - on while
30:20 - true till
30:22 - then it would be repeated right this
30:25 - thing would be repeated so if you run
30:28 - the something like this then while race
30:29 - on it's always true so obviously you
30:32 - have to change this to false you have to
30:35 - flip this flag variable to exit from
30:37 - this Loop right so what you need to do
30:40 - you have to find out if the turtle is
30:42 - moving see from this side to this side
30:47 - so the finish line is this line so at
30:50 - this point of time at this point of time
30:53 - the y coordinate is 200 so you have to
30:57 - check check the y
30:58 - coordinate if the turtle has reached
31:02 - this y coordinate plus 200 because here
31:04 - the y coordinate was- 200 if it has
31:07 - reached to plus 200 then stop and that
31:10 - would be the winner right so first you
31:13 - have to find out the x and y coordinate
31:15 - of these Turtles and for that we have a
31:20 - method P let me just show you see tell
31:25 - Turtle State it's position or p s it is
31:28 - going to return turtle's current
31:29 - location x and y coordinate right so
31:32 - yeah that's exactly we want
31:35 - so X comma y two coordinate we want is
31:39 - equal to whatever the turtle turtle dot
31:45 - P this thing we want and then we check
31:48 - if that y coordinate y coordinate is
31:52 - greater than or equal
31:54 - to what the
31:58 - height flooor division 2 400 by 2 that
32:02 - is
32:03 - 200
32:06 - means you have
32:08 - to do is RA so is equal to F you have to
32:13 - flip this variable to stop this while
32:15 - loop right and before that let's print
32:19 - one line the winner is and whatever the
32:22 - color we have right now of that
32:26 - turtle so for that you have to use F
32:29 - string and we'll fetch the color using
32:33 - using the turtle dot because here we
32:35 - have or rather than Turtle we just take
32:38 - suppose I I'm going to take T so that is
32:41 - also fine here you can take T do forward
32:44 - by this distance and we want T do
32:47 - position
32:51 - and the winner
32:53 - is T
32:55 - dot if you you want to print T do color
33:00 - winner is this color
33:04 - Turtle when is this turtle or when is
33:07 - like pink turtle or yellow turtle
33:09 - something like this okay so if I run
33:12 - this and uh let's take we have six
33:15 - Turtles right
33:25 - so these Turtles are not moving so
33:28 - definitely there is something wrong in
33:30 - our code let me just see or maybe if you
33:33 - have just figured out you can just
33:35 - comment out this thing like what is the
33:37 - problem why this is not moving it is not
33:40 - responding let's close the program and
33:43 - three let's
33:47 - see okay this would be 14 total
33:51 - list okay still the turtle list is empty
33:54 - because we haven't appended a turtle in
33:58 - the list so Turtle list dot a pend and
34:04 - whatever the turtle you have created new
34:06 - turtle because obviously that is
34:08 - important now because we are using this
34:10 - Turtle list here to Loop through for
34:14 - this this thing right okay this time I
34:17 - hope this will work fine let's run and
34:19 - let's suppose we have only three Turtles
34:21 - this time okay they're
34:24 - moving and the winner is see now the
34:27 - winner is obviously that was Green
34:28 - Turtle so green green turtle two time it
34:31 - is
34:31 - printing
34:33 - see the turtle green turtle is out of
34:36 - our range if you not able to see now
34:39 - it's visible right so obviously the
34:41 - winner is Green Turtle but it what it is
34:43 - printing green green turtle why two time
34:46 - green green okay let's
34:49 - see okay because we are printing T dot
34:52 - color and if you see if you see this
34:55 - thing the this color
35:01 - method see Turtle do color so it is
35:04 - going to return the current pen color
35:07 - and current fill color as a pair of
35:09 - color specification so return or set pen
35:11 - color and fill color two color it will
35:14 - return pen color as well as fill color
35:16 - but I want only pen color so better to
35:20 - use here T
35:22 - dot pen
35:24 - color now let's run this and let's take
35:27 - only this time also three Turtles and
35:30 - okay they're
35:32 - moving and this time also winner is now
35:34 - see green turtle as we know from this
35:38 - also we can see the winner is Green
35:39 - Turtle so that is not visible so better
35:43 - to write down this thing Al if Y is
35:44 - greater than equal to height divide by 2
35:46 - means 200 not 200 because that would be
35:48 - proper boundary 200- 20
35:53 - pixel right that is I guess will work
35:57 - fine so let's run this
36:01 - again and again they're
36:03 - moving okay this time winner is this
36:06 - pink turtle pink turtle yeah it's
36:10 - seen so you can do here- 20 orus 30
36:13 - right
36:15 - see so this is how we can do like the
36:19 - turtle race kind of thing or you can
36:21 - just play around with this code and you
36:23 - can just make it more sophisticated and
36:25 - more
36:27 - maybe like more colorful or more
36:31 - uh complex type of thing because it is
36:34 - simple one but one thing we
36:37 - have like if you enter by default if I
36:42 - run this and intentionally I enter here
36:45 - a rather than any number so it will just
36:48 - give any my value error but I want it
36:51 - should print like invalid input please
36:55 - try again
36:57 - or you have to enter only numeric value
36:59 - please try again this kind of thing
37:02 - right so this also we can check rather
37:04 - than converting this into here int
37:07 - whatever you will enter first check if
37:11 - the
37:12 - count is we function is
37:16 - digit it will return true if you will
37:19 - enter digit right whatever you will
37:21 - enter that is a digit 1 2 3 4 5
37:23 - something like this
37:25 - right if this is a digit then convert
37:30 - then convert this count into
37:34 - int right if
37:38 - not
37:40 - else print a error message please enter
37:44 - a numeric value between 2 to 10 this
37:46 - kind of thing it should give and here we
37:48 - can do like from here only I want from
37:51 - this only it will again Ask how many
37:53 - Turtle you want to participate rather
37:55 - than execute this F Els right so yes we
37:59 - have a keyword
38:00 - continue if you use it continue from
38:02 - this line only it will again go to the
38:04 - at the very first line of the loop right
38:07 - rather than again checking this F else
38:10 - because obviously no need to check this
38:11 - F else if the count is not a digit right
38:15 - let's run this and see what is happening
38:18 - if I enter here a see please enter a
38:20 - numeric value between 2 to 10 again it
38:23 - is asking I'm entering H again it is
38:25 - asking I'm entering one again input is
38:28 - not in given range try again if I enter
38:31 - here seven yeah that is
38:37 - fine now you can see the turtle are
38:40 - moving
38:41 - so the winner is pink
38:44 - turtle right and as you can see the
38:46 - winner is pink turtle right so I guess
38:51 - that was not tough one it's easy
38:54 - one so if you want want this this code
38:57 - then you can I'll just copy paste this
38:59 - thing in description right or maybe in
39:01 - the I'll pin the com comment fine or if
39:06 - you want this code like in any other way
39:09 - you can let me know in comment section
39:11 - fine so I hope you got this project this
39:13 - kind of project you can just work on
39:15 - these kind of projects right these are
39:17 - beginner project for beginners right
39:20 - okay in the next video we'll see higher
39:23 - order function right and then or maybe
39:27 - we'll see one more project first right
39:29 - then we will see high order function so
39:30 - now I'll see you in the next video till
39:32 - then bye-bye take care
