00:00 - hello everyone i hope you all are safe
00:02 - and doing good so in this lecture i am
00:04 - going to discuss with you what are some
00:05 - skills required for coding if you want
00:08 - to learn to code what skills you should
00:10 - have or these are some general skills i
00:13 - am not going to discuss these you know
00:14 - skills or these habits more precisely if
00:17 - i say these are habits these are really
00:20 - helpful in your real life also not in
00:22 - just coding in your real life you should
00:24 - have these habits
00:25 - right
00:26 - so maybe for some students skill is like
00:28 - a high level word so they are like oh my
00:31 - god skills no these are some habits
00:32 - general habits i am not going to discuss
00:34 - these points these habits from the
00:36 - perspective of those programming
00:37 - languages or tech aspects no these are
00:39 - general habits i think everybody is
00:42 - having these kind of habits so if you
00:44 - are having these habits definitely you
00:46 - can be a good coder you can learn coding
00:48 - right
00:49 - so now first thing is you should be
00:52 - curious
00:53 - like whenever you see something you have
00:56 - questions in your mind
00:58 - right it's not like that uh
01:00 - like if you are you know going to any
01:03 - shopping websites how those shopping
01:05 - websites are working whenever you go to
01:07 - your gmail account you fill your user id
01:10 - your password whenever you click that
01:11 - login button your gmail id will be
01:13 - opened how this is working what is the
01:15 - process behind the scene you are
01:17 - interested behind the process
01:20 - what is going on behind the scene
01:22 - not whatever you can see like whenever
01:25 - you you know any faculty teach you
01:28 - any topic
01:29 - so you are curious about that thing it's
01:31 - not like that they are teaching okay
01:32 - fine ma'am we got it no you should have
01:35 - the capability you should have the
01:36 - capability of you know cross questioning
01:39 - you should be curious at that time like
01:41 - whenever let's take a simple example
01:43 - whenever uh any concept i am teaching
01:46 - like areas i'm teaching then your first
01:49 - question would be why aries why we are
01:51 - studying arrays these kind of questions
01:53 - you should be curious like if you are
01:54 - playing any game computer game
01:57 - you should have in you know in your mind
01:59 - that how someone has written you know
02:02 - the code
02:03 - how you are able to play those games
02:05 - what is you know behind the scene
02:08 - i also want to make these kind of games
02:10 - or if you are working any if you are
02:12 - using any app like paytm how this app is
02:14 - working any shopping website how these
02:17 - apps are working
02:18 - right
02:19 - so
02:20 - are you having this capability like are
02:22 - you curious or someone will tell you
02:25 - this thing okay fine someone will tell
02:26 - you this thing okay fine you are not
02:28 - curious about anything
02:30 - right so if you want to learn coding if
02:32 - you want to be a good coder then
02:34 - definitely you have to be curious
02:37 - right and this habit will ultimately
02:39 - lead to what critical thinking skill
02:41 - logical thinking skill analytical skill
02:44 - and these skills are required obviously
02:46 - if you want to learn coding you should
02:47 - think logically you should have critical
02:49 - thinking right if i will say in that
02:52 - tech aspects or i i you i you know if i
02:54 - use those bigger terms
02:56 - but
02:57 - this will ultimately lead to those
02:59 - skills first of all you have a habit of
03:02 - this you should be curious
03:04 - second very important point is what
03:07 - patience
03:08 - you should have patience nowadays maybe
03:11 - you are you think that everybody wants
03:13 - to learn everything quickly but it's not
03:16 - like that you can learn coding in just
03:17 - 21 days it's not that kind of habit
03:19 - it needs practice years of practice
03:21 - actually for to be a good coder right so
03:24 - you have to be patient you just have to
03:26 - calm down you have to be very focused
03:29 - right towards your whatever you are
03:31 - doing whatever you are learning
03:33 - right
03:34 - because whenever you start learning
03:35 - coding
03:37 - many times you will get depressed you
03:39 - will feel demoralized
03:41 - right you will feel like
03:44 - i can't do coding i'm not able to write
03:45 - down a sing simple program how will i
03:48 - i'll write those you know complicated
03:50 - type of program today those data
03:51 - structure programs how i'll make a
03:54 - software or these kind of things
03:57 - okay
03:58 - slowly you will do that those things
04:00 - also but at starting everybody is going
04:03 - to know everybody go through that phase
04:07 - if someone is a good coder right now
04:09 - they have also started from zero right
04:12 - they were also at that level and if you
04:14 - will have patience obviously you will
04:15 - not give up
04:16 - easily right and that is
04:19 - very much required skill if you want to
04:21 - learn coding right because it's not easy
04:24 - to learn how to code right obviously it
04:27 - would be a tough process at starting you
04:29 - will do definitely you will do silly
04:31 - mistakes like
04:32 - while writing header file you will write
04:34 - s t u d i o dot it's not stdio dot h and
04:37 - when you will check the program
04:39 - i'm damn sure you will not able to find
04:41 - out those single those simple errors
04:43 - those silly mistake
04:45 - and then you will get frustrated you
04:46 - will not able to read those error
04:48 - messages like which kind of error is
04:50 - this in which line this is the error and
04:51 - this is also a skill
04:53 - to read those error messages find out
04:56 - yeah in this line this is the error that
04:58 - is also skill and it also required
05:00 - practice right but at starting you will
05:02 - not able to find out a simple error
05:05 - right but yeah it happens with everyone
05:07 - just practice just keep patience calm
05:10 - down focus
05:11 - if you are frustrated take a break
05:14 - then again write code
05:17 - that is the only way there is no
05:18 - shortcut right
05:20 - third thing
05:21 - which is very important is you should be
05:23 - self-motivated person
05:26 - see here i am writing self-motivated
05:30 - it's not like that
05:32 - you are that kind of student who are
05:34 - watching those motivational videos
05:38 - to get motivation right you have to be a
05:41 - self-motivated person
05:43 - because many times at starting you will
05:45 - feel demotivated how many times you'll
05:46 - watch those motivated motivational
05:48 - videos and you will just waste your time
05:50 - no
05:51 - see if you are really interested in
05:52 - coding if you think that
05:55 - if you have the idea what is the benefit
05:56 - of coding how coding can improve your
05:58 - life your you know in real life also
06:01 - that coding skill is very much helpful
06:04 - that also you can discuss in a separate
06:05 - video
06:06 - but
06:08 - you have to be a self-motivated person
06:10 - it's not like that just watch the
06:11 - motivational video and get motivation
06:13 - after 10 days again watch motivational
06:15 - videos and for two days get more to get
06:17 - you know get motivated no
06:20 - if you are interested in learning if you
06:22 - are interested in coding
06:24 - no external motivation would be required
06:27 - to keep learning that is for damn sure
06:30 - it's not for coding only
06:33 - anything for anything if you are
06:34 - interested in that doing that thing no
06:37 - external motivation would be required
06:40 - for doing for learning right
06:43 - if you are really interested
06:45 - so you have to be a self-motivated
06:47 - person for that
06:50 - next is
06:51 - uh
06:52 - you have the you know ability to sit
06:56 - at one place for at least like
06:58 - two to three hours
07:00 - at least for two to three hours and
07:02 - starting
07:03 - right
07:04 - after that you can obviously after that
07:06 - if you are interested you will
07:08 - automatically you will you know uh will
07:10 - sit for three or four hours or six hours
07:12 - a day and seven hours or a day and you
07:14 - you enjoy i'm damn sure you will enjoy
07:17 - that thing
07:18 - but it's starting maybe some students
07:20 - are like you know they are not able to
07:22 - sit in front of computer for
07:24 - you know half an hour
07:26 - so you have to make this habit yes you
07:29 - can sit in front of your computer for
07:30 - two to three hours at least for you know
07:33 - one and a half hour in starting and you
07:36 - can write down some code so this is also
07:38 - required the skill right
07:41 - next is what
07:42 - you have this attitude self-learning
07:45 - attitude it's not like that always there
07:48 - would be someone to teach you whenever
07:50 - any new technology come or whenever any
07:52 - new language you want to learn there is
07:54 - somebody to teach you you will get notes
07:56 - you will get video tutorials properly
07:58 - you will you know you will be
07:59 - spoon-feeded no
08:02 - technology is changing rapidly
08:05 - so you have to be a self-learner right
08:09 - to learn those changing technologies
08:13 - this skill is also very important
08:15 - self learning skill
08:17 - nobody is going to teach you how to code
08:20 - like sit i'll teach you how to code
08:22 - write down this program right on this
08:23 - program this is there and that is a no
08:26 - you have to sit you have to practice you
08:29 - have to find out the resources from
08:30 - where you can learn from google from any
08:33 - youtube videos you can you have to read
08:35 - documentation
08:36 - you have to go to that maybe for
08:39 - projects maybe for on github you have to
08:41 - go to that stack overflow you have to
08:43 - ask questions
08:45 - you have to do everything
08:48 - yourself if you want to be a good coder
08:51 - so this attitude is also very important
08:54 - self learning attitude so see some
08:56 - students blame your you know their
08:57 - faculties they don't teach you well
09:00 - so
09:01 - at some point of time it's a maybe you
09:03 - can also think is a plus point for you
09:06 - then you learn yourself and that will
09:08 - increase your self-learning ability and
09:11 - that would also be and it's not for
09:13 - coding nowadays every student should
09:15 - have self-learning attitude right if you
09:17 - want to learn any new technology
09:19 - obviously
09:20 - in college they'll teach you right but
09:23 - after that when you will go to industry
09:25 - when you go to job
09:26 - technology changing rapidly after every
09:29 - you know two to three years five years
09:30 - ten years so
09:32 - if you want to be you know in that
09:36 - industry for a long
09:38 - then if you want to get promoted then
09:40 - obviously you have to increase your
09:42 - skills your skill skill your skill set
09:45 - so you have to learn new technologies
09:48 - yourself there will be no one to teach
09:49 - you
09:50 - right
09:51 - so i think these are some basics and
09:54 - general habits or you can say skills or
09:57 - maybe more precisely if i say this will
09:59 - help you
10:01 - if you want to learn coding or if you
10:03 - have these habits you can say that yeah
10:05 - i can learn coding i can be a good coder
10:07 - right but these are general skills not
10:09 - for coding
10:10 - every student i think should have these
10:12 - type of skills i am not saying that for
10:14 - coding only these are required but if
10:17 - you do anything in your life i guess
10:19 - definitely everyone should have these
10:21 - skills
10:22 - fine
10:23 - and see i haven't taught any obvious you
10:26 - know skill that is obviously if you want
10:27 - to write down subcode obviously you you
10:30 - you know some programming language
10:32 - right
10:33 - otherwise you can't write down code and
10:35 - that is something like if i say i'm
10:36 - hungry
10:39 - you should eat something
10:42 - so if you want to learn if you want to
10:44 - code definitely you need some
10:46 - programming languages
10:48 - those are obvious points so those i
10:50 - haven't discussed i have at starting
10:52 - only i have told you i will discuss some
10:54 - general habits only right
10:57 - so i guess if i i have left with
11:00 - something you can tell me in comment box
11:02 - and if you want me to make these kind of
11:04 - videos more you can tell me in comment
11:06 - box you can write down like on which
11:08 - topic i should make videos so now that's
11:11 - it for this video i'll see you in our
11:13 - next video till then bye bye take care
