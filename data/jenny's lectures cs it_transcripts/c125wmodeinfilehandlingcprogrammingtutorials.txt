00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:01 - programming we are discussing file
00:02 - opening modes in c in the previous video
00:04 - we have discussed r plus mode basically
00:06 - we have discussed r mode
00:08 - read write append and r plus r plus is
00:11 - for both reading and writing we will
00:13 - discuss in this video w plus mode this
00:15 - is also for reading and writing so maybe
00:17 - you will say what is the difference
00:19 - between these two r plus and w plus both
00:21 - are for reading and writing purpose but
00:22 - there is huge difference between these
00:24 - two those differences also we will
00:26 - discuss with the help of practical with
00:28 - the help of program i'll show you
00:29 - program also on this mode w plus mode
00:32 - and it at last i'll give you an
00:33 - assignment also now that is very
00:35 - interesting you are supposed to tell me
00:37 - what would be the answer of that thing
00:38 - right all these things will discuss in
00:40 - this video but before they just want to
00:42 - tell you one thing for gate 2022

01:56 - and tricks practice questions numericals
01:58 - along with the detailed explanation of
02:00 - the concepts plus doubt clearing
02:02 - sessions would also be conducted so you
02:04 - can get your doubt cleared in those
02:05 - sessions but these are paid but you can
02:08 - use my code jkl10 to get ten percent
02:10 - discount for you on your paid
02:11 - subscriptions so all the relevant links
02:14 - and detail i'll put in the description
02:15 - box of this video if you are interested
02:17 - you can go and check out now let's see
02:18 - what is wps mode see it will open a file
02:21 - both for open a file both for
02:23 - reading and
02:24 - writing
02:26 - but
02:27 - see
02:28 - the special cases
02:31 - if
02:32 - file doesn't exist means it will create
02:35 - a new file
02:38 - and
02:39 - will open that file if file exists in
02:42 - that case
02:43 - what it will do
02:45 - then it will
02:46 - truncate the file length to 0 means it
02:49 - will erase the previous content and the
02:51 - cursor would be at the starting of that
02:53 - line suppose this is my file abc dot txt
02:56 - right
02:57 - and in this file i have jenny
03:00 - right now cursor is here only at the
03:02 - last fine suppose so now if file exists
03:05 - and you will open this file into w plus
03:06 - mode then this jenny would be raised
03:08 - means the content would be raised and
03:10 - the cursor would be at the starting only
03:12 - now the file length is zero right
03:16 - next thing is what this mode is you know
03:19 - especially for writing purpose our
03:21 - w plus mode right
03:23 - like r plus mode was for mainly for
03:25 - reading purpose but we can do writing
03:27 - also right so i hope new now you can you
03:30 - know write down the difference between r
03:32 - plus mode and w plus mode
03:34 - both for reading and writing but in r
03:36 - plus mode if file doesn't exist it will
03:39 - not create a new file right it will
03:41 - return null that's it in w class mode if
03:44 - file doesn't exist it will create a new
03:46 - file and open that file
03:48 - right next thing is what in our plus
03:50 - mode
03:51 - if file exist then it will open the file
03:53 - but previous content would not be erased
03:55 - it would be as it is right and
03:58 - now your next content new content you
04:00 - can add wherever you want to add like
04:02 - maybe in the starting or in the middle
04:04 - of
04:05 - the already existed content or at the
04:07 - last so mainly if you want to update
04:10 - the previous file then you will open
04:12 - that file in r plus mode
04:14 - but in w plus mode the previous content
04:16 - would be erased so you can write down
04:18 - new content from the starting one
04:21 - right
04:22 - so i hope now the difference is clear r
04:24 - plus more than w plus more now you can
04:26 - write down the differences three or four
04:27 - differences right now let's see a
04:29 - program of w plus mode
04:39 - now see we have a file abc dot txt
04:40 - suppose in this file i have journey so
04:42 - now i'm going to open this file into wps
04:45 - mode if
04:46 - fp is null means
04:50 - because of some condition because of
04:52 - some error f open is not able to open
04:54 - the file it will turn null so cannot
04:57 - open file right
04:58 - if successfully f open has opened the
05:00 - file in that case if this doesn't exist
05:02 - it will create a new file and it will
05:04 - open the file right now
05:06 - you can read the content see
05:09 - now my question is already
05:11 - existed content in this valid journey
05:14 - and w plus mode is for both reading and
05:16 - writing so can you read this jenny
05:19 - yes or no
05:21 - no why so because you are opening this
05:23 - in w plus mode
05:25 - so as soon as you will open this in w
05:27 - plus mode as soon as this file would be
05:29 - loaded in that ram
05:32 - this jenny would be erased so now you
05:35 - cannot read this content
05:36 - so now what content you will read
05:39 - whatever content you will write here now
05:41 - the new content that content you can
05:43 - read
05:45 - right that is not possible in w mode you
05:48 - cannot read the content you can only
05:50 - write how let me show you see now
05:52 - suppose i am writing here
05:55 - f
05:56 - put s and i am writing a string like
05:59 - khatri
06:02 - right
06:03 - and in
06:05 - fb
06:07 - this i want to write
06:09 - right a string i am providing or you can
06:11 - take the input from the user
06:13 - many you know
06:14 - possibilities are there you can try out
06:15 - your own different different things so
06:17 - this i want to put in this file so now
06:20 - what happened right now this journey
06:21 - would be erased and khatri would be here
06:26 - now at this point of time
06:28 - cursor is here only
06:31 - right at the last
06:32 - now you will say i want to read this
06:34 - content
06:35 - for reading let me just write down the
06:37 - loop i am writing down the loop why
06:40 - character by character i am reading this
06:42 - content and
06:44 - i am just printing what whatever
06:45 - character i am reading ch
06:49 - right and at last
06:51 - f close
06:53 - fp so before using ch obviously we are
06:56 - supposed to declare ch here
06:58 - now character by character i am reading
07:00 - i hope you know you know you are aware
07:02 - with this
07:03 - logic because we have discussed many
07:04 - times whenever
07:05 - you know we have written a program in
07:07 - the previous videos how to read a
07:08 - content from a file right so just write
07:10 - down a while loop
07:11 - f eof means it will return end of file
07:14 - just pass the file pointer
07:16 - right and logical not
07:19 - fine
07:19 - now
07:21 - is it
07:22 - you know possible now to read this
07:23 - content means this this program will
07:25 - give on the screen kathry or not
07:30 - it will not give
07:31 - why so because
07:33 - we have written this content khatri here
07:35 - and now the cursor is here only
07:37 - in the last means file pointer is here
07:41 - right now the condition is why
07:43 - f eof fp means it will return end of
07:46 - file
07:47 - so yeah
07:49 - fp is at end of file
07:51 - so now it will give what end of file
07:54 - means it will give true
07:56 - true means one and
07:58 - one
07:59 - not we are using negation
08:02 - logical note
08:03 - one not means zero
08:06 - zero zero means false means while zero
08:10 - zero means false so we will not enter
08:11 - into this while loop
08:13 - and f close so now we are not going to
08:16 - we are not able to read this content
08:18 - so what you should do now
08:20 - you are supposed to move this fp from
08:23 - the last to beginning here to read the
08:26 - content
08:28 - how you will move this there is a
08:29 - special function rewind
08:33 - rewind and just pass
08:35 - the file pointer
08:38 - now after this after writing after this
08:41 - line you will write down this function
08:43 - remind fp
08:44 - now
08:45 - whenever a compiler will see this
08:47 - function means now the file pointer has
08:49 - moved from here to from
08:51 - last to beginning
08:54 - now you can read this content and now
08:55 - you can write down this logic means not
08:57 - f eof it will let an end of 5 but the
09:00 - cursor is here only
09:02 - is it end of 5
09:03 - no so it will return false false means
09:06 - 0.
09:08 - negation or not 0 means 1 so while 1
09:11 - means true so we are going to enter here
09:14 - and f get c means a single character we
09:16 - will read means
09:17 - k would be red and k would be stored in
09:20 - ch and k would be printed
09:22 - now again cursor would be here only here
09:25 - here like this you can read at last
09:28 - it will get an endo file and that's it
09:30 - so you are supposed to you know write
09:32 - down a special function in your program
09:34 - while using w plus mode and while
09:36 - reading the content right i hope now you
09:38 - got this
09:39 - right if you have any query you can ask
09:41 - me in comment box now let me show you
09:43 - practical of this thing
09:44 - so let me create a new file
09:47 - we will name it as
09:49 - w plus
09:51 - mode dot c right
09:53 - and r plus mode the content i am going
09:55 - to copy this content only because it is
09:58 - almost
09:59 - same
10:00 - right
10:03 - whatever the difference i'll see you see
10:05 - we are going to open the file first of
10:07 - all in w plus mode
10:08 - right
10:15 - so here we will write w plus if f is
10:17 - null okay it will print error and or you
10:20 - can say cannot open file that thing you
10:21 - can do
10:22 - now rather than rather than reading or
10:25 - suppose you want to read this obviously
10:27 - this is of no use because you cannot
10:29 - read the content
10:31 - right because content has been erased
10:33 - you are opening in this w plus mode so
10:37 - this is not we are not you know writing
10:39 - this reading logic or if you want if you
10:42 - want to write you can write this logic
10:43 - and you can run this program and you can
10:44 - see what output you are getting
10:46 - now there is nothing in this abc dot txt
10:48 - if you will open this in wps mode and
10:50 - now i want to add what f put is jenny
10:54 - only jenny
10:55 - i want to add right and f close
10:58 - so see abc.txt file is this one and here
11:01 - i have suppose i have
11:03 - this is awesome
11:05 - this content i have in this file right
11:08 - now let me just run this program and see
11:11 - what output you are getting
11:13 - okay now see the successfully this has
11:15 - been run because there is nothing on the
11:16 - output screen because we are not
11:17 - printing anything just let me just show
11:19 - you this abc dot txt file now in this
11:21 - file we have jenny previous content was
11:23 - this is awesome that has been erased and
11:25 - the new content is jenny so now suppose
11:27 - if you want to read this content
11:30 - so
11:31 - this this logic this one the reading
11:35 - logic you will write
11:36 - after
11:37 - this thing
11:39 - after f put so whatever function you
11:41 - will do like f put c or f printf or
11:44 - whatever thing you will use the logic of
11:45 - writing something to the that file after
11:48 - that you will write the logic of reading
11:50 - right so now
11:52 - this is what
12:00 - let me just
12:02 - remove these comments
12:04 - now see
12:07 - it is not going to print anything on the
12:08 - screen i have told you because now
12:11 - cursor was the file pointer was at the
12:13 - last of the file so it will not uh you
12:16 - know you are supposed to move that
12:18 - cursor to
12:20 - at the starting so using rewind we can
12:23 - move that cursor to starting or let me
12:25 - just comment out this thing first
12:27 - and now let me just run this
12:29 - whether you are getting
12:31 - jenny the output or not whether you are
12:33 - this program is printing
12:36 - this jenny or not on the screen let me
12:38 - just run this
12:41 - see it will not print anything it is
12:43 - just running it is not printing anything
12:46 - on the screen so now let me just
12:49 - close this and let me just write down
12:51 - just add this line this function rewind
12:54 - fb right and rather than you know using
12:57 - this f get is now i want to read
13:00 - this
13:01 - character by character let's say this
13:03 - logic also
13:05 - so just pass in a get c function you are
13:07 - supposed to pass the file pointer and
13:09 - one character it will return so that
13:11 - character we are going to store in
13:13 - which variable ch
13:16 - and in printf
13:18 - just we are printing percentage c and
13:22 - ch
13:23 - right so before using the ch
13:26 - uh yeah obviously we are supposed to
13:30 - declare this
13:32 - variable ch right
13:36 - now character by character we are going
13:37 - to read and now let me just run this and
13:39 - show you the output
13:40 - on the output screen you are getting
13:42 - jenny
13:43 - i hope you can see this and in the file
13:45 - also we have now jenny right so this is
13:48 - how you can read using this special
13:50 - function rewind why we use this function
13:52 - i think that is clear to you now one
13:54 - assignment for you is see suppose in r
13:57 - plus mode
13:58 - this is my program
14:02 - this was
14:03 - the previous video we have discussed so
14:04 - r plus mode in r plus mode i am opening
14:06 - this file right and first i am writing
14:08 - this logic
14:10 - reading logic i am reading whatever the
14:12 - content in that file and after reading i
14:14 - am writing this f put as jenny
14:17 - not
14:18 - this one only one line i am putting i am
14:20 - writing f put as jen
14:22 - so it will
14:23 - write also in that file it will read
14:25 - also first and then it will write so now
14:27 - where
14:28 - this jenny would be written in this file
14:30 - suppose any in abc dot txt in abc dot
14:33 - txt i have
14:36 - jenny khatri
14:39 - is
14:41 - awesome
14:44 - faculty okay i am writing this danica is
14:46 - awesome faculty this is my content in
14:48 - abc.txt and
14:52 - this program is there so now you are
14:53 - supposed to tell me what would be the
14:55 - output where this jenny would be added
14:58 - right i hope this
15:00 - r plus is clear to you but
15:02 - before
15:03 - you know running this program on your
15:05 - computer screen and just you know copy
15:07 - pasting that output yeah this would be
15:08 - the output no
15:10 - you have to think you have to drive in
15:11 - this code and then you have to tell me
15:13 - right and then you can uh you know check
15:15 - you can tell your answer you can run
15:17 - this code and you can tell your answer
15:18 - right
15:19 - now i hope uh you know that's it for
15:20 - this video now
15:22 - so i hope this w plus mode is clear to
15:24 - you guys now in the next video we will
15:25 - see a plus mode right so now i will see
15:27 - you in the next video till then bye take
15:28 - care
