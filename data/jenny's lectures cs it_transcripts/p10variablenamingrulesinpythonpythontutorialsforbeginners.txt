00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen about variables what
00:05 - is variable why do we need variables how
00:07 - to create variables how to assign values
00:09 - how to use those variables in your
00:11 - program and all okay and we have seen
00:12 - one program also how to swap two numbers
00:15 - with the help of a third variable okay
00:17 - it's not like that we're using only
00:19 - third variable you can swap two number
00:20 - without using any other variable you can
00:22 - swap numbers but those program we can
00:25 - discuss later
00:26 - in some videos okay
00:28 - now there are some rules to name
00:30 - variables
00:32 - okay how to name a variable like we have
00:34 - taken a b c x y z or name age these kind
00:37 - of things
00:38 - no there should be some name of a
00:40 - variable so
00:41 - you have to follow some rules
00:43 - to name a variable okay
00:46 - so what are those rules first thing is
00:48 - what
00:49 - it is not a rule actually
00:51 - but you should take care of this thing
00:53 - the variable name should be meaningful
00:56 - see
00:57 - what i am saying is
00:59 - suppose uh let's take this example
01:03 - i'm asking from user
01:05 - what is your name
01:07 - okay
01:07 - whatever user will enter that name i'm
01:10 - going to store in a variable now the
01:12 - name of that variable should be
01:14 - meaningful
01:16 - what is your name so i'm asking your
01:18 - name so better to name
01:20 - take a meaningful name like name i'm
01:23 - taking although you can take a
01:25 - a is equal to what is your name
01:27 - so whatever name like jenny i'll provide
01:29 - so in a journey would be stored
01:32 - but that is not meaningful by looking at
01:33 - a if after some days if i look at this
01:36 - variable a by looking at this i cannot
01:39 - say which type of value is stored in the
01:41 - same and if i have taken name here then
01:44 - i can tell
01:46 - after a few days also whenever i look
01:47 - back at my code like this name is having
01:50 - name of
01:51 - someone
01:52 - so it should be meaningful if i ask like
01:54 - what is your age
01:58 - so better to take variable name age or
02:00 - you can take my age multi-word variable
02:03 - you can also take but for that also we
02:05 - will see some rules okay
02:07 - it should be so like that what is your
02:09 - age and i'm taking name
02:11 - yeah it will not give any syntax error
02:12 - or nothing else you can take this
02:14 - variable name also but
02:16 - it is not meaningful like i'm asking age
02:18 - and i'm storing that variable in
02:20 - variable name name
02:22 - i think that's not meaningful okay so
02:25 - first thing it should be meaningful
02:28 - second thing is what now the actual rule
02:30 - comes
02:31 - in a variable name
02:34 - a variable name can have only
02:36 - alphanumeric characters like from
02:39 - capital a to z
02:41 - small a to z
02:42 - zero to nine numbers and
02:45 - underscore
02:47 - these things a variable name can have
02:50 - like for example we have h so it is
02:52 - having a two z numbers uh sorry a two z
02:56 - uh letters
02:58 - so if i uh say something like this like
03:01 - name
03:02 - one that is also fine
03:05 - if i am saying name 1 2 3 that is also
03:08 - fine
03:09 - if i say
03:10 - name underscore 1 that is also fine
03:13 - because underscore is also allowed
03:15 - ok so variable name consists of these
03:18 - things
03:18 - but no special symbol is allowed no
03:21 - special symbol other than this
03:22 - underscore is allowed if i write
03:24 - something like this name
03:26 - space one space is also not allowed
03:30 - you have to you know keep taking notes
03:31 - of this thing
03:33 - space is not allowed if i write
03:36 - hash this is also not allowed if i write
03:38 - something like this like
03:41 - age
03:42 - question mark the special symbol is also
03:45 - not allowed any special symbol is not
03:47 - allowed rather than this underscore
03:50 - okay
03:51 - now
03:52 - next rule is what a variable name must
03:55 - start
03:56 - either with a letter or
03:58 - underscore
04:00 - if i write something like this
04:03 - one underscore age this is invalid
04:06 - because it is starting from a digit so
04:08 - variable name cannot start with the
04:10 - visit yeah this is fine age underscore 1
04:13 - this is fine
04:15 - it is starting with letter
04:17 - or underscore age
04:20 - this is also fine so variable name can
04:22 - start with must start with either a
04:25 - letter either small or capital or
04:28 - underscore
04:30 - okay it cannot start with the desert
04:34 - now
04:35 - let me give you some example
04:39 - of multi-word
04:41 - name if i'm taking
04:43 - my age
04:44 - multi-word name you can also take
04:47 - okay like my variable name my age
04:52 - like
04:53 - this thing
04:54 - so if i write multi uh word name then
04:57 - there are some rules
04:59 - also like some cases or technique also
05:01 - you can use
05:02 - first is camel case
05:05 - in camel case or in this technique what
05:07 - we do
05:08 - each word like i have this name my
05:14 - name
05:15 - so i'm having here two words one is my
05:18 - one is name so every word other than the
05:21 - first word will start with capital
05:24 - letter see first is with small then
05:26 - capital
05:28 - if i take like my
05:31 - variable
05:33 - name so i'm having three words my
05:36 - variable name three words are there so
05:38 - first word is having small letter
05:40 - next word is starting with capital
05:42 - letter next word is starting with
05:44 - capital letter so this technique is
05:46 - chemicals next is
05:48 - pascal case in this case
05:51 - every word is having every word with
05:53 - start with a capital letter like
05:56 - my
05:58 - variable
06:00 - name
06:01 - or my
06:03 - name
06:04 - each word will start with capital letter
06:07 - third is
06:08 - one is like snake case in this case
06:11 - each word would be separated with the
06:13 - underscore like my underscore
06:16 - variable underscore
06:18 - name three words are there each word is
06:21 - separated with the
06:23 - underscore so i generally prefer in this
06:26 - case
06:28 - to use multi you know multi word
06:30 - variable
06:32 - so
06:34 - i'm just giving you some example you
06:35 - have to tell me this is assignment for
06:37 - you guys like these variable names are
06:39 - valid or invalid see
06:41 - so these are some variable name like
06:43 - roll number having a space then id then
06:46 - s1 underscore name then no number with
06:48 - underscore then
06:50 - age with the double quotation mark you
06:51 - have to tell like these are valid or not
06:54 - and some more rules are one more rule is
06:56 - what
06:57 - uh there are some reserved word and
06:58 - python so you cannot use
07:01 - those reserved word as a variable name
07:02 - like in c and c plus also we have some
07:04 - keywords or reserved words those cannot
07:06 - be used as
07:07 - variable name like class
07:09 - in this case for example we have class
07:12 - is a reserved word so this cannot be
07:13 - used as a variable name okay so you can
07:15 - check out the reserved words those we
07:17 - cannot use as variable name
07:19 - fine python is case sensitive actually
07:22 - okay
07:22 - so in this case like if i'm writing this
07:26 - raw number and if i'm writing
07:28 - this role number these two are
07:30 - considered as different names because
07:32 - here r is capital here as small so
07:34 - python is case sensitive language so
07:36 - these variable name are also you can say
07:38 - case sensitive fine so you have to tell
07:40 - these are valid or not one more thing
07:43 - we have discussed how to assign values
07:44 - or how to create variables so there are
07:46 - some ways which statement is valid
07:49 - which is valid and which is invalid you
07:50 - have to tell in comment section one
07:52 - statement is where a is equal to 1 i'm
07:54 - assigning a value 1 to the c then 1 is
07:57 - equal to a
07:58 - this assignment or where underscore a is
08:00 - equal to 1
08:02 - which one is valid which one is invalid
08:04 - you have to tell me in comment section
08:06 - okay so now i guess there are simple
08:09 - rules so variable i know how to name a
08:11 - variable that's it about for now it's
08:14 - about variables uh in the next video
08:16 - we'll see uh data types primitive data
08:19 - types in python so now we'll see in the
08:20 - next video till then bye take care
