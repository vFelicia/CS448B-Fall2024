00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:02 - c we are discussing printing pattern
00:03 - programs i have discussed one program
00:05 - in that program i have discussed how to
00:07 - print this pattern right star pattern
00:09 - pattern
00:10 - this is what ah half pyramid in this
00:12 - video we are going to talk about
00:14 - how to print this pyramid inverted half
00:16 - pyramid maybe you are thinking ma'am you
00:18 - are just
00:19 - discussing the simple programs please
00:20 - discuss some complicated programs right
00:22 - please please first of all you have to
00:24 - be very strong at your basic if your
00:26 - basics or fundamentals are strong if
00:28 - you are very good in these programs they
00:30 - then you can easily modify these
00:32 - programs and you can easily grab the
00:34 - advanced concept the the complicated
00:36 - pattern you can easily
00:37 - you know write a program to print
00:40 - complicated pattern if you get
00:41 - these things you know basics that's the
00:44 - biggest mistake students
00:46 - do they switch to the advanced one they
00:48 - think that this is very simple no need
00:50 - to write down this the program for this
00:51 - no need to
00:52 - uh even read this study this right that
00:55 - is the biggest mistake you do
00:57 - if you want to vary you want to be very
00:58 - good in programming please focus on your
01:00 - basics first
01:01 - right write down this program with your
01:04 - hand first of all with pen and paper
01:06 - then jump to your laptop right on these
01:08 - programs if your concept the basics are
01:10 - strong they can easily grab the advanced
01:12 - concepts
01:13 - that is why i am focusing first of all
01:15 - the basic ones
01:16 - i will discuss the complicated pattern
01:18 - also in later videos though
01:21 - so now see in how many ways you can
01:24 - print
01:24 - this pattern we have two ways right i'll
01:27 - discuss both of these
01:29 - first thing please first of all check
01:32 - this one
01:32 - i'll put the link of this in the side
01:34 - button or i'll put the
01:35 - the link of that see playlist on my
01:38 - youtube channel that i have created
01:40 - in the description box of this video you
01:42 - can check out that place but first of
01:43 - all
01:43 - first of all check out this program then
01:45 - you can easily grab this concept
01:47 - now see the inner how many lines are
01:50 - there
01:50 - five lines outer loop
01:54 - we are going to take variable i for
01:55 - inner luffy i am going to take variable
01:58 - j right and i and j two variables i am
02:01 - going to take
02:02 - fine how many lines are there five lines
02:05 - so outer for loop would be i
02:07 - is equal to one i less than equal to
02:09 - five
02:10 - and i plus plus five times i want to
02:12 - print five lines i want to print so that
02:14 - is why one two five
02:16 - this outer for loop is responsible to
02:18 - print the rows or you can see the lines
02:21 - but now how to print these
02:25 - you know stars the actual printing would
02:28 - be done with inner for loop or you can
02:29 - see the inner for loop would be
02:30 - responsible for printing these
02:33 - columns how many columns in first line i
02:35 - have five stars
02:36 - in second i have four then three then
02:38 - two then one
02:40 - right so when i is one the inner for
02:43 - loop j should be repeated how many times
02:46 - five times when i is two j
02:49 - should be repeated 4 times when i is 3 j
02:52 - should be repeated 3 times
02:54 - when i is 2 sorry i is 4 j should be
02:57 - repeated 2 times when i
02:58 - is 5 j should be repeated only one time
03:01 - right so now what you you will do how to
03:05 - write
03:05 - j now j is what see j is decreasing in
03:08 - this case
03:09 - here j was increasing so we'll do j
03:12 - minus minus
03:13 - right but
03:17 - half the day would be initialized with
03:20 - first of all five how many star i want
03:23 - to print five star
03:25 - right so j i'm going to initialize with
03:27 - five
03:28 - and j the condition would be greater
03:31 - than equal to
03:32 - i right
03:36 - and now j minus minus
03:39 - because we cannot fix this one right
03:42 - like five four four
03:43 - because the j value is not changing in
03:46 - every line
03:48 - so it depends on the value of i right so
03:51 - j g greater than equal to y and j minus
03:53 - minus and now
03:54 - we are going to print star right
03:58 - that's it and in in the outer for loop i
04:00 - am going to print
04:01 - slash n because here also new line
04:03 - operators are one then two then three
04:05 - then four and
04:06 - five right so that is why five times
04:08 - only new line operator
04:09 - should be you know uh printed so that is
04:12 - why i am putting this one
04:13 - only in the outer loop that would be
04:16 - done only five times that's it
04:18 - now see the working of this thing i is
04:20 - equal to
04:21 - 1 right 1 less than equal to 5 condition
04:24 - true
04:25 - we are going to enter here j is equal to
04:27 - 5
04:29 - 5 greater than equal to i i value is 1
04:31 - yes 5 greater than 1
04:33 - condition true now we are going to enter
04:35 - again here
04:36 - we are going to print star right now we
04:39 - will print
04:40 - star 1 star
04:43 - now j minus minus j becomes 4 again
04:46 - check the condition 4 greater than equal
04:47 - to i
04:48 - i value is 1 4 greater than i yes
04:51 - condition is true again print 1 star
04:54 - j minus minus three condition still true
04:58 - yes again print j two condition still
05:01 - true two is greater than equal to one
05:03 - again print j one condition still tree
05:07 - one greater than equal to one yes
05:09 - condition 2 again
05:10 - print j minus minus now j becomes 0
05:13 - is 0 greater than equal to i no
05:15 - condition falls
05:16 - now we are going to what we exit from
05:19 - this inner loop
05:20 - the immediate after condition after the
05:22 - center loop is what slash and now slash
05:24 - would be
05:25 - what printed printed means the cursor
05:27 - would go into the
05:28 - new line it is new line operator right
05:31 - now again now here now i plus plus
05:34 - we are out from the inner loop now now i
05:36 - plus plus i becomes now two
05:38 - condition trio yes we are going to enter
05:41 - again
05:42 - now j would be initialized again with
05:44 - five
05:45 - is five greater than equal to two yes
05:48 - condition trim
05:49 - so print start right
05:52 - so i hope you got the working now you
05:54 - can try run this and the star would be
05:56 - printed
05:57 - four times sorry
06:01 - four then three then two two greater
06:04 - than equal to two yes one two three four
06:05 - four
06:06 - times two represented now j minus minus
06:07 - j become one but one is not greater than
06:09 - equal to i so
06:10 - that's it new line operator now in
06:14 - same step would be repeated and this
06:17 - output you will get
06:19 - now when i becomes like 3 then 4 then 5
06:23 - then i become 6
06:24 - condition is not true control will out
06:26 - of the loop so this is how this would be
06:28 - printed this is the first way
06:30 - second way is now we are not going to do
06:34 - j minus minus
06:35 - we are going to update this i 1 i loop
06:38 - in j i am printing what same one
06:42 - j should be 1 j greater than equal
06:45 - sorry j less than equal to
06:48 - i and j plus plus we are going to do
06:52 - i minus minus see maybe we can do like
06:55 - this
06:56 - rather than 1 2 3 4 what you can do is 5
07:00 - 4 three two one when i
07:04 - is five they should be repeated five
07:05 - times when i is four j is also four
07:08 - i three j is also three i two j is also
07:10 - two i one j is also one
07:12 - right they should be also repeated uh
07:13 - one time or two time like this right so
07:16 - here i
07:16 - is decreasing not increasing yeah i can
07:19 - also do
07:20 - this thing i minus minus we can do so
07:23 - here
07:23 - decreasing means it should be i minus
07:25 - minus right
07:27 - j i would be initialized not from 1 from
07:30 - 5
07:32 - right and i should be not less than
07:34 - equal to 5 i should be what
07:36 - greater than equal to 1 when i becomes 0
07:39 - then we are going to stop
07:40 - so i should be greater than equal to 1
07:44 - that's it and j would be same j i am
07:47 - going to initialize with 1
07:48 - j less than equal to i and j plus plus
07:50 - now see the working of
07:52 - this one see first of all i is 5
07:56 - i value is 5. so condition true it is 1
08:00 - greater than equal to 1 we are going to
08:02 - enter here j is equal to 1
08:04 - 1 less than equal to 5 i is 5 because
08:07 - here i am writing i
08:08 - right 1 is less than equal to 5 yes
08:10 - condition true we are going to enter
08:11 - here star will be printed
08:13 - j plus plus j becomes 2 again 2 is less
08:16 - than equal to i
08:17 - 2 less than equal to 5 condition 2 again
08:19 - we are going to print
08:20 - now j is 3 3 is less than equal to 5
08:23 - again star google printed
08:25 - js4 condition is still true again it
08:27 - will be printed
08:28 - j is 5 condition is still true again it
08:30 - will be printed
08:32 - j6 now condition is not true 6 is not
08:34 - less than equal to 5
08:35 - now we are going to enter what we are
08:37 - going to exact from this loop and slash
08:39 - n so cursor would
08:40 - be here now what i minus minus now i
08:43 - becomes 4
08:45 - 4 greater than equal to 1 yes condition
08:47 - is 2 we are going to enter again here
08:48 - now j would be initialized again with 1
08:52 - so i hope you put the concept now right
08:55 - 1 is less than equal to i
08:56 - i value is 4 yes 1 is less than 4 so
08:59 - star will be printed
09:01 - now this time how many times j should be
09:02 - repeated 1 2
09:04 - 3 and 4 times right because i value is
09:07 - four so
09:08 - four star won't be printed here when i
09:09 - if j becomes fives
09:11 - five that would condition is not true
09:12 - and they're going to exit from the loop
09:14 - right like this it would print this
09:17 - pattern
09:18 - so these are two ways you can either
09:21 - modify j
09:21 - loop or you can modify the outer loop
09:23 - also i i hope you got the concept now
09:26 - right so now let me show you the output
09:28 - of this program on my
09:30 - laptop so now let me show you the output
09:32 - on this ide
09:33 - see this was our previous program this
09:36 - this this is the output of this program
09:37 - let me run this again
09:39 - so this would be the output of this
09:40 - program we have half pyramid but now
09:43 - we we are we want to print inverted half
09:46 - pyramid so what you have to change
09:48 - two ways i have discussed all the ways
09:49 - two ways
09:51 - of printing this inverted parameter
09:53 - first is what
09:54 - rather than j plus plus will do j minus
09:56 - minus so j should be started from five
09:59 - and j what greater than equal to i
10:03 - and j minus minus right and then we'll
10:06 - print star
10:07 - that's it and now let me run this and
10:11 - see this is the inverted half parameter
10:14 - right second way is we are not going to
10:17 - do j minus minus we will do what i minus
10:19 - minus so j
10:20 - loop would be same as the previous one j
10:23 - is equal to 1
10:24 - j less than equal to
10:28 - i and j plus plus right but
10:32 - we will do i minus minus so i should be
10:34 - starting from 5
10:37 - i greater than equal to
10:41 - 1 and i minus minus
10:44 - right now let me run this again
10:47 - see now again we are getting the same
10:49 - output so these are two ways
10:51 - rather than if you want the line should
10:53 - be 5 or 10 or 16 or 15
10:56 - then what you can do rather than doing
10:57 - this just this this hard coding what
10:59 - you can take how many rows you want you
11:02 - can
11:02 - write down what just take another
11:05 - variable name
11:06 - and ask from the user
11:14 - enter number of rows
11:17 - right at the runtime fine
11:24 - and we will take this at runtime using
11:27 - scan a function
11:28 - right scanf percentage d and
11:32 - address of the name of the variable
11:35 - variable is rows right now rather than
11:40 - writing this 5 because i don't want how
11:42 - many rows i want
11:43 - right user will enter so now
11:47 - we will initialize the psi with rows
11:50 - right i is equal to rows and i greater
11:53 - than equal to 1 i minus minus
11:55 - right and that's same now let me run
11:58 - this
11:59 - see it is asking enter number of rows
12:03 - now let me enter number of rows uh
12:05 - suppose 10
12:07 - enter c we are getting 10 number of
12:10 - lines or 10 number of rows and this is
12:12 - inverted half parameter right so this is
12:15 - one more thing or
12:16 - if you want to update this with the j
12:18 - then what you can do
12:19 - here what you can write j is equal to 5
12:21 - j greater than equal to i and z
12:23 - minus minus so that will also give you
12:25 - same output so you can run this
12:27 - again so i hope you got this program
12:30 - right
12:31 - so now i hope you would have to print
12:33 - this pattern
12:34 - right so now that is for this video in
12:36 - the next video i'm going to print a
12:37 - different pattern so now i'll see you in
12:39 - the next video till then bye take
