01:45 - box of this video
01:46 - you can go and check out so let us
01:49 - discuss why test series are so important
01:51 - and when to start test series see
01:55 - many students don't start test series
01:58 - why so they say that
02:00 - their preparation is still going on they
02:01 - are not done with their preparation
02:03 - after that they'll start
02:04 - taking test series so it is not the
02:06 - right time to start after completing
02:08 - your preparation like maybe in
02:10 - december or january you should start
02:12 - taking test series
02:14 - you should start taking that subject
02:16 - wise test or maybe mock test
02:18 - as soon as possible obviously you can't
02:20 - take full length mock test
02:22 - before your preparation but suppose if
02:24 - you have prepared six or seven subjects
02:26 - then also then at the right it is the
02:28 - right time to start full length mock
02:29 - test
02:30 - but subject wise uh test when you can
02:33 - start once you have completed your
02:34 - subject
02:35 - then start taking ah start you can start
02:38 - taking the
02:39 - subject wise mock test for that subject
02:42 - right
02:43 - do not wait till your preparation is
02:45 - over because see
02:46 - preparation is nowhere is never going to
02:49 - end and many students don't go for test
02:51 - series because of some
02:52 - fear like if they will not score very
02:56 - well in test series at that time what
02:58 - will happen
02:59 - they have this fear see take it as a
03:02 - good point if you start taking the test
03:05 - series definitely
03:07 - you will come to know your weak points
03:09 - if you have prepared very well
03:11 - right you think that i have prepared six
03:13 - or seven subjects i have prepared
03:15 - suppose one subject very well
03:17 - right so better it's time to test your
03:19 - knowledge
03:20 - it's time to test your concepts whether
03:23 - yeah you have knowledge you have
03:24 - prepared very well but
03:26 - whether you are able to solve question
03:29 - from that subject
03:30 - see knowledge is different thing it
03:32 - doesn't mean you have knowledge you have
03:34 - prepared suppose 10 subjects
03:36 - very well right you have very good
03:38 - conceptual knowledge
03:39 - but one thing which is very important is
03:42 - what how you
03:42 - attempt your exam on the final day it
03:45 - doesn't mean one has prepared all the
03:47 - ten subjects and definitely he is going
03:48 - to get a very good rank
03:50 - no maybe one student has prepared only
03:53 - eight subjects
03:54 - and he is going to be only india anchor
03:56 - means stopper
03:58 - so accuracy matters a lot and speed also
04:01 - matters a lot at that time
04:03 - and when your accuracy or speed comes
04:05 - with practice
04:06 - so definitely you should practice by
04:09 - giving some test series a mock test
04:11 - right only one test series is sufficient
04:14 - if you want to go for more test then
04:18 - two not more than two two test series
04:20 - are more than enough
04:22 - or maybe one is also sufficient right
04:25 - because you have to analyze test series
04:27 - also that thing will discuss in
04:28 - next video so first point is by taking
04:32 - test series by giving that
04:34 - mock test you will come to know where
04:35 - you are standing in the competition
04:38 - and take it as a healthy competition
04:40 - means don't feel
04:41 - demotivated if you don't score
04:44 - very well in test series it's fine it
04:47 - happens with
04:48 - everyone after taking 15
04:51 - 20 30 40 tests your score will
04:54 - definitely increase
04:56 - so it's fine if in first test or second
04:58 - or third or till maybe
05:00 - five four ten tests you are scoring very
05:02 - well like maybe around 30
05:04 - or maybe 25 30 35 like this that is fine
05:07 - you have to identify your area of
05:09 - improvement and definitely
05:10 - you have to work hard on your weaknesses
05:12 - that thing also will discuss
05:14 - so this is very first point second thing
05:16 - is
05:17 - if you take test series if you take
05:19 - subject wise test or full length
05:20 - test then you will come to know the
05:23 - variety of questions they ask
05:25 - means suppose if you are good at very
05:28 - in any subject or in any topic or in any
05:30 - concept you are very good
05:32 - you have practiced many questions as
05:33 - well but baby
05:35 - sometimes in gate they ask tricky
05:37 - questions or different type of questions
05:39 - and you are not able to solve that
05:40 - question in gate exam
05:42 - so it is a negative point for you
05:44 - although you have prepared that
05:46 - subject or that topic or that concept
05:48 - you are very good at that but still
05:50 - you are not able to solve question so
05:52 - face these type of questions
05:54 - different different type of question
05:55 - before actual exam
05:58 - that is a good approach so that while
06:01 - attempting the actual exam if this type
06:03 - of question
06:04 - comes then you can solve that question
06:06 - right
06:07 - next is definitely it is going to help
06:10 - you
06:10 - obviously in your revision and um your
06:12 - brushing up the concepts because
06:14 - when you take the test series if you are
06:16 - not able to attempt any question
06:18 - then definitely you will see why you are
06:21 - not able to attempt that question the
06:22 - topic and you will revise that topic
06:24 - again
06:25 - so it is a good approach to revise
06:27 - fourth point is what
06:29 - you will come to know your strong points
06:32 - as well as your weak points means strong
06:35 - points means the subjects in which you
06:37 - are
06:37 - performing very well in which you are
06:38 - good you are able to solve question
06:40 - and quickly as well and those subjects
06:43 - in which you are not good or maybe some
06:44 - concepts or some topics from which you
06:46 - are not able to attempt question
06:48 - so once you come to know that in these
06:50 - subjects or in these concepts in these
06:52 - topics you are weak
06:53 - you can work according to that you can
06:55 - work hard on that topics
06:57 - next you will come to know your silly
06:59 - mistakes
07:00 - silly mistakes like maybe when you are
07:04 - noting dying
07:04 - noting down the information given in the
07:06 - question that is wrong
07:08 - or sometimes you remember the formula
07:11 - but
07:11 - you use some different sign like maybe
07:14 - plus minus or
07:15 - divide or into something like this
07:18 - different
07:18 - wrong sign in that formula or maybe
07:20 - sometimes
07:22 - while marking you have got the answer
07:23 - but while marking that answer
07:25 - you mark it wrongly or you don't you
07:27 - don't check the unit of the answer these
07:28 - are some silly mistakes
07:30 - see these silly mistakes occurs in which
07:34 - a question easy question means you know
07:37 - how to solve that question you can solve
07:38 - that question easily but because of
07:40 - silly mistakes
07:42 - you lose marks and that is where you
07:45 - lack
07:46 - your lacking behind because in gate even
07:48 - one mark can make a huge difference
07:51 - in your ring so while taking test series
07:54 - you will come to know if you are doing
07:55 - some silly mistakes
07:56 - so you can analyze your silly mistakes
07:58 - and you can work on
08:00 - those mistakes right next is it will
08:03 - help you to find out
08:04 - the best attempting strategy for you
08:07 - like it doesn't mean that one youtuber
08:10 - is saying follow this strategy while
08:11 - attempting
08:12 - that question paper your friend is
08:13 - saying this strategy you should follow
08:15 - you will get maximum marks
08:16 - no strategy at last ultimately would be
08:19 - yours only
08:20 - so you can practice all the strategies
08:22 - like first i'll solve
08:24 - two numbers uh two marks technical
08:26 - question or first i'll show
08:28 - general amplitude or maybe some students
08:30 - uh start from sequentially like 1 to 65
08:32 - question
08:33 - so you can practice all the strategies
08:35 - while taking test series
08:37 - full length test and you can find out
08:40 - which one is best for you next very
08:43 - important thing is
08:44 - it will teach you how to manage time
08:47 - because when you take a full length test
08:51 - then obviously that would be a proper
08:53 - gate type environment 65 question 180
08:56 - minutes and
08:56 - see yeah one more important thing you
08:58 - should use virtual calculator and that
09:01 - scribble pad at the time when you are
09:03 - taking test series you should create
09:04 - that proper gate type of environment
09:06 - like you are sitting
09:07 - in your actual exam so it will teach you
09:10 - time management
09:11 - you will come to know while solving
09:13 - which type of questions you are taking
09:15 - too much time or which type of question
09:17 - you can solve quickly
09:18 - so according to that you can practice
09:21 - suppose
09:22 - if you have a poor time management you
09:24 - are not able to attempt
09:25 - question at least 55 questions or 60
09:29 - question then
09:30 - you have a poor time management you have
09:31 - to work
09:33 - on that on these things you have to
09:35 - practice you have to increase your speed
09:37 - right and you will come to know how to
09:39 - handle how to tackle that
09:41 - exam pressure because if you take test
09:44 - series full length mock test then you
09:45 - will be habitual of facing that
09:47 - exam whole environment you will will be
09:49 - habitual of using virtual calculator
09:51 - schedule scribble pad for uh rough work
09:54 - and
09:54 - you will be habitual of you know
09:56 - managing time like 65 question i have to
09:58 - attempt in 180 minutes
10:00 - so when you enter in the examination
10:01 - examination hold on your final day then
10:03 - you
10:04 - will not feel nervous because sometimes
10:06 - it happens if you don't know the
10:07 - strategy to attempt the exam if you
10:09 - don't don't know how to manage
10:11 - time at that time if you don't know how
10:12 - to use virtual calculator
10:15 - at that time yeah your preparation is
10:17 - very well
10:18 - right but still you are not able to get
10:20 - a good rank because of
10:21 - pressure and that nervousness so that is
10:24 - why test series are very important and
10:26 - start taking test series as soon as
10:28 - possible
10:29 - don't wait till you know your exam
10:32 - your preparation is over so that's it
10:34 - for this video now in next video i'm
10:36 - going to discuss how to analyze
10:38 - test series so i'll see in the next
10:40 - video till then bye take
