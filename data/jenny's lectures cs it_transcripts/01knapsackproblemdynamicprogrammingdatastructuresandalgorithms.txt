00:00 - hi guys today's topic is knapsack
00:03 - problem so in this problem what is there
00:06 - you are given some items with their
00:08 - weights and profits okay some items will
00:11 - be you will be given with their weights
00:13 - and profits and one container you are
00:15 - you are given or you can say one
00:17 - knapsack say simply knapsack is what
00:19 - it's like a bag that you carry on your
00:21 - back or you can say shoulders okay so
00:24 - suppose one container or one bag is
00:28 - given whose weight is also given or you
00:30 - can say the size of this is also given
00:33 - some kgs this w will decide the maximum
00:36 - size to store these items okay
00:40 - now what is this problem basically you
00:43 - have to select some items from the given
00:47 - items and you will put those items into
00:49 - this bag or you can say container okay
00:52 - and you have to select these items such
00:55 - that you will get the maximum profit let
00:58 - us suppose you have chosen some items
01:00 - from this and you have you have put
01:02 - these items into new into your bank and
01:04 - suppose you are going to sell these
01:07 - items then I put a say item select
01:09 - Carney hey when you will sell these
01:10 - items then you will get the maximum
01:12 - profit okay this is the knapsack problem
01:16 - suppose where it is given what 20 kg so
01:22 - you can select any number of items but
01:25 - the total number of weight of the
01:28 - selected items would be less than or
01:30 - equal to 20 because octopus egg bag had
01:32 - this map you can carry only 20 kg
01:35 - weights okay so up with nahi items up to
01:37 - choose cursor thousand car total number
01:39 - of weights of those item would be 20 kg
01:41 - taco se select carnea so that the make
01:43 - the profit would be maximum so two types
01:47 - of knapsack problem are there one is 0
01:50 - and knapsack problem and second one is
01:52 - fractional knapsack problem okay so
01:55 - today we'll discuss what zero-one
01:57 - knapsack problem what is there in this
01:59 - problem either you can pick the item
02:03 - completely or you will not pick the item
02:06 - means either 0 or 1 0 means appaluse
02:09 - item copic nahi kiya 1 means you how
02:11 - picked that I
02:12 - you can say the complete item suppose
02:15 - one item is having great 2kg okay one is
02:19 - having made three kg so you can pick
02:23 - this item so you have to pick that item
02:27 - completely means you have to pick 2 kg
02:30 - of this item you cannot pick that you
02:32 - you cannot pick 1 kg of this item okay 1
02:35 - kg omnipeek earlier 1 kg Jordy I know
02:37 - know the items would not be divisible
02:39 - you will have to pick that item
02:41 - completely ok let us suppose some
02:45 - individual things like laptop a complete
02:48 - laptop HEPA karna padega you cannot pick
02:50 - the screen up nificantly bucket scotch
02:52 - or dia or you can say mixer EPCOT will
02:55 - be a complete pick an operator something
02:57 - like that ok so that is 0 1 knapsack
03:00 - problem either you will pick that item
03:01 - completely or you will not pick that
03:03 - item
03:04 - ok that is 0 & 1 EPSA perhaps our
03:06 - problem fractional make out that you can
03:08 - divide that item suppose one item is of
03:11 - 3 kg you can pick only 2 kg of this item
03:14 - and you can left 1 kg okay it's not
03:19 - compulsory that you have to pick 3 kg of
03:21 - this item this is the fractional
03:23 - knapsack problem and this is solved with
03:25 - what greedy method and zero-one knapsack
03:28 - problem and will be sold with dynamic
03:32 - programming method okay so we'll take
03:36 - one example and we'll discuss the
03:38 - zero-one knapsack problem so let us take
03:41 - an example here weights are given 3 4 6
03:44 - & 5
03:45 - profits are also given 2 3 1 4 okay and
03:48 - the W is given what 8 suppose we are
03:50 - taking 8 kg weight is given 3 kg 4 kg 6
03:54 - kg and 5 kg and the weight is w is what
03:56 - 8 kg or you can say that bag in which
03:59 - you'll store you will pick the item and
04:01 - you will keep that items okay that bag
04:05 - is having capacity 8 kg okay and here we
04:09 - have number of items what for number of
04:11 - items we have fine now one method is
04:14 - what you can write in it you can say X I
04:18 - suppose X is any item we will write what
04:22 - like this 1 0 0 1 it means
04:26 - the happy one height means we have
04:28 - selected in the first item we haven't
04:30 - selected second item we haven't selected
04:32 - the third item we have selected what
04:34 - fourth item having read five something
04:37 - like this will write the answer in this
04:39 - form one and zero phone okay now if you
04:42 - have total number of items for then how
04:44 - many combinations would be possible
04:47 - suppose one combination is zero zero
04:49 - zero one another one is zero one zero
04:52 - one something like this we have four
04:56 - items now having weighed three four six
04:58 - and five so total number of combination
04:59 - would be 2 raised to power 4 that is 16
05:02 - ether you can make the 16 combinations
05:05 - and you can check which combination you
05:07 - will select so that you will get the
05:09 - maximum profit okay our second approach
05:12 - is what will solve this method using
05:14 - what dynamic programming approach now
05:16 - what is dynamic programming approach I
05:18 - have told you many times that in dynamic
05:22 - programming the complicated problem will
05:24 - be divided into sub problems and
05:27 - ultimately when you solve the
05:28 - subproblems then you will use the
05:30 - solution of the subproblems and
05:32 - ultimately you will get the result of or
05:34 - you can say the solution of the
05:35 - complicated that final problem okay you
05:38 - will not solve the complete problem at
05:41 - once we divide that problem into
05:43 - sequence of steps fine
05:46 - now how this problem would be solved
05:48 - using dynamic programming approach now
05:51 - the very first thing is you are supposed
05:52 - to draw a matrix okay now this is the
05:56 - matrix you have drawn say this side we
05:59 - have taken what from 0 to 8 because
06:02 - total weight is given is what 8 your
06:04 - backup capacity wait total maximum
06:06 - capacity is what and then you'll write
06:08 - from 0 to 8 okay
06:12 - now this side we have taken what waits
06:14 - and profits and the one variable that is
06:17 - I I would be from 0 to 4 first we'll
06:21 - write go to 0 then we have 1 2 3 4 4
06:23 - items then in 0 to 4 that total would be
06:26 - 5 total number of items plus 1 here we
06:29 - have written what weight of each item
06:31 - and here we have written what profit of
06:33 - each item and see these weights should
06:35 - be written according to their or you can
06:37 - say
06:37 - and in ascending order weight is three
06:40 - four six and five but I have written
06:42 - here what three four five six five six
06:45 - they should be in increasing order or
06:48 - you can say the ascending order okay now
06:51 - according to that you will write the
06:52 - profit two three four and then one now
06:57 - you will fill this table well you are
06:59 - not taking the complete weight at a time
07:01 - see we have divided this problem into
07:03 - the sequence of steps eight sub steps
07:06 - first we'll take the weight total weight
07:09 - suppose we have zero then we'll increase
07:11 - the weight one by one and these are the
07:13 - sub problems this answer of sub problems
07:15 - would be you know written in the these
07:18 - columns or cells and finally here in the
07:20 - final cell you will get the answer okay
07:23 - because finally weight is what it now
07:25 - let us start how you will fill this
07:27 - table first row and first column would
07:30 - be what column would be able to zero
07:32 - because weight is what zero you are
07:34 - taking a bag having there to 0 then
07:36 - obviously well no we cannot select any
07:39 - item okay and first row also would be
07:43 - what first draw make it happen a pass we
07:45 - have we have in if we don't have any
07:48 - item because here what we have 0 we
07:50 - don't have any items so we don't know
07:52 - right what 0 this is what for 0 and is 0
07:55 - first one first column now you have to
07:57 - fill these got these cells have you will
08:00 - fill this one find out here what we have
08:05 - weight is what I weight of item is what
08:07 - three now we have only one item of in a
08:10 - well of available set we have got one
08:12 - item having weight three we don't have
08:13 - these items okay these below items we
08:16 - have only one item because I value is
08:18 - what now one this is I value 0 1 2 3 4
08:21 - and this is the value of this W 0 to 8
08:24 - now if you have one item having 8 3 okay
08:28 - and the weight of the bag is what the
08:32 - capacity is what one can you fill a bag
08:36 - having capacity 1 kg with a item having
08:40 - weighed three kg no we cannot fill so we
08:42 - will write here what 0 now here what we
08:46 - have a bag of capacity to we cannot put
08:48 - this item having weight three
08:51 - see because it's zero and knapsack
08:54 - problem up core Jelena here to complete
08:56 - three easy appropriate aapke and Kaka
08:58 - okay up iske you're either you will pick
09:02 - that item completely or don't pick that
09:04 - item okay our simple trick is if weight
09:08 - is three then up to zero to two you will
09:11 - write what the above values to copy the
09:13 - value of above cell 0 0 into 0 now at 3
09:17 - now you have a bag of capacity 3 and
09:20 - weight of that item is also 3 you can
09:22 - pick this item obviously we can keep
09:25 - this item here if you will pick that the
09:27 - site and then profit would be what -
09:29 - then here you will write what - okay now
09:34 - in this case we have a bag of capacity
09:39 - for obviously we can put we have only
09:42 - one item having date trees and we can
09:45 - put this one then profit would be would
09:47 - be what - so here also - here - here -
09:52 - and here also will have two because we
09:54 - have only one item that is having bid
09:56 - three so grab three may poop curse at
09:58 - the auto four five six seven eight maybe
10:00 - I was kaput curseth you next is what I
10:03 - value is increased and I value is now
10:06 - what - okay now we have two items we
10:09 - have one is item having made three one
10:11 - is having I have eight four now you have
10:14 - to fill this one total weight is what we
10:17 - have one bag having size what 1 kg can
10:20 - we put this one this item having bit 4
10:22 - kg no we cannot put this item here okay
10:25 - so what you will do here is you will
10:28 - write what the value of the above cell
10:30 - that is 0 okay now weight is what only
10:34 - two can you put this item no we cannot
10:37 - select because weight of this item is
10:39 - for that is greater than 2 can you
10:41 - select this item no we cannot select
10:42 - this one because through is also greater
10:44 - than 2 so will write here what 0 our
10:47 - simple step is what if this weight is 4
10:49 - then from 0 to 3 0 1 2 3 less than this
10:53 - for you will copy the all values from
10:55 - the above cell that is from 0 1 2 3 here
11:00 - what you will write we will copy the
11:01 - value from the about cell okay now for
11:04 - the same
11:06 - we have two items now one is having made
11:09 - three one is having wait for and the
11:11 - total weight is what for now we have two
11:13 - choices either he will select this one
11:15 - or you will not select this one if you
11:17 - will select this one here then the
11:19 - profit would be what three okay and
11:23 - three plus what you have to do is you
11:26 - have to find out maximum three plus you
11:30 - will go one step up and what you have to
11:33 - do is see here what weight is what for
11:35 - we have selected this one then four
11:37 - minus four is what zero then we will go
11:39 - to the column having weight zero here
11:42 - what we have zero three plus zero or
11:44 - this one maximum of this new value or
11:49 - the value just above this sell a value
11:52 - above the cell is what to why we have
11:54 - taken this value if we have selected
11:56 - this one then the profit would be three
11:58 - plus zero if we will not select this one
12:00 - the only remaining item is what three
12:03 - then you have to select this item and
12:04 - the way profit of this item is what to
12:07 - and here what what it has written that
12:09 - is to the best of three and two is what
12:12 - maximum of this one is what three then
12:14 - we will write here what three okay now
12:17 - next is here we have total weight is
12:19 - what five if and available items is
12:23 - worth four and three now you have to
12:26 - select maximum of C if we select this
12:30 - item we are selecting this four we can
12:32 - select this four because total weight is
12:34 - what we have five then if we have
12:36 - selected this item then profit would be
12:38 - what 3 plus remaining weight is what 5
12:43 - minus 4 that is one go to the above sell
12:47 - and go to the column having weight one
12:50 - hey what is the value zero three plus
12:53 - zero or the value just above this sell
12:57 - what the value is what is to maximum of
13:00 - three and two is what three will select
13:03 - we will write here what three see if you
13:06 - will not select this one then only
13:08 - remaining item is what tray then you
13:10 - have to select this three and the weight
13:12 - the profit is what to so this one is
13:15 - written here is two so here we have
13:17 - taken this word the value from the
13:18 - about it that is three same with this
13:22 - one suppose we have selected this one
13:24 - their profit is what three plus what is
13:29 - the value of this wait six six minus
13:31 - four is what to go to the above row and
13:34 - then you have to go to the column having
13:36 - wait - 6 - 4 - that is 0-3 mine 3 plus 0
13:42 - or you will take this one the value in
13:45 - the bow sell 3 + 2 maximum is what 3
13:49 - okay now for this cell we have now in
13:56 - available set we have 2 items having
13:57 - made three and four if we select this 4
14:00 - we have to find out the maximum if we
14:03 - select this 4 then the profit is what 3
14:06 - plus you have selected this 4 and the
14:09 - total weight is what 7 the remaining
14:11 - weight is what 7 minus 4 that is 3 okay
14:15 - now go to the upper row and find out the
14:19 - column having grade 3 now see here what
14:24 - is the profit that is to the 3 + 2 +
14:29 - maximum of this one or what is the value
14:32 - in the upper cell that is to the maximum
14:35 - of 5 and 2 what is the maximum that is 5
14:38 - it will take care what fight sorry for
14:43 - this one same case suppose we have
14:47 - selected this 4 then you have to find
14:49 - out maximum move if you selected this 4
14:52 - then profit is what 3 3 + we have
14:56 - selected this 4 but the weight is what
14:58 - total weight is what 8 the remaining
15:00 - weight is what 8 - 4 that is 4 now go to
15:04 - the upper row and find out the column
15:06 - having weight for hair profit is what 2
15:08 - 3 + 2 and in upper row we have what two
15:11 - things know this one is what 5 now I
15:15 - value is increased by 1 now we have
15:18 - those three items in our available said
15:22 - now next item is what having made five
15:24 - simple trick is what what from 0 to 4
15:27 - you will copy the value from the upper
15:30 - cell 0 0 2 and
15:32 - three from zero to four because here we
15:35 - have what five okay now at five you have
15:38 - to find out the best ace now you can
15:41 - select either you can select this 5 4
15:43 - you will not select this 5 if we select
15:46 - this 5 then profit would be what for
15:49 - this one profit is what 4 4 + find out
15:53 - the remaining weight total weight is 5
15:55 - we have selected 5 remaining is what 5 -
15:58 - 5 0 go to the Perot and find out the
16:00 - column having weight to 0 here what we
16:03 - have value or you can say the profit is
16:05 - 0 and what is the value in the upper
16:07 - sell happy happy fill car there then you
16:10 - have to find out the value just in the
16:12 - upper cell that is 3 out of 4 + 3 which
16:15 - is which is maximum that is 4 here also
16:19 - maximum of suppose we have selected this
16:24 - 5 now profit is what 4 plus we have to
16:29 - deliberate 6 we have selected 5
16:31 - remaining weight is about 6 minus 5 that
16:33 - is 1 only go to the upper low and go to
16:36 - the column having weight 1 here what we
16:38 - have value 0 4 + 0 in the upper row we
16:41 - have 3 out of 4 & 3 which one is maximum
16:44 - that is 4 now in the case of 7 you have
16:48 - to find out same case maximum if you
16:51 - select this 5 profit is worth 4 plus we
16:55 - have selected 5 and the total weight is
16:58 - 7 remaining weight we have waters 7
17:01 - minus 5 that is to go to the Perot and
17:04 - go to the column having bit to hear what
17:07 - we have 0 4 + 0 in the upper row row we
17:10 - have what 5 now 2 4 & 5 which one is
17:12 - maximum 5 will select what 5 okay now
17:16 - next here same case maximum of we have
17:22 - selected suppose this 5 having item
17:24 - having weight 5 profit of this as what 4
17:27 - 4 + total weight is 8 remaining weight
17:31 - is 8 minus 5 that is 3 go to the upper
17:34 - row go to the column having weight 3
17:35 - here what we have value
17:37 - - 4 + 2 in the upper robot we have 5 out
17:41 - of 6 & 5 the maximum is 6
17:43 - okay now for the
17:46 - astro we have now I values increased by
17:52 - one we have now four items in our
17:54 - available set three four five and six
17:56 - now I got paid is what six then from
18:00 - zero to five you will copy the value
18:02 - from the a person as a piece now for six
18:07 - two cases either you will select this
18:09 - six or you will not select this one okay
18:12 - you have to find out the best case if we
18:15 - select this sixth one suppose we have
18:17 - select this one six then wait is what
18:20 - sorry the profit is what one okay plus
18:25 - now remaining weight is what total
18:27 - weight is 6 6 minus X zero go to the
18:30 - upper row here what we have in the 0th
18:32 - column having zero value is what profit
18:35 - is what 0 1 plus 0 in the upper robot we
18:38 - have 4 out of 1 and for which one is
18:39 - maximum for here in this case maximum
18:44 - move suppose we have selected 6 same
18:46 - profit is 1 plus 7 minus 6 that is 1 in
18:51 - the upper row go to the column having
18:54 - the 8 1 0 1 plus 0 in upper over we have
18:57 - five out of 1 & 5 which one is maximum 5
19:00 - here also you have to find out maximum
19:03 - of 1 plus 8 minus 6 that is 2 in the
19:09 - upper row in the column having weighed 2
19:12 - we have what profit 0 in the upper sell
19:15 - what we have 6 out of one and second
19:17 - which one is maximum that is 6
19:19 - okay now here the answer would be in the
19:24 - last row and last column 6 the maximum
19:28 - profit would be what 6 okay the formula
19:32 - is C I'm just writing the formula here
19:35 - you can check out that formula how you
19:38 - will fill out a particular cell what is
19:42 - the formula suppose the name of this
19:43 - matrix is I am taking m M of I and W
19:50 - particular cell
19:51 - suppose this cell this cell would be
19:53 - mfin WI value is what this 3 + W value
19:57 - for this cell is what this 3
20:00 - three and three how you will fill out
20:02 - this value maximum of Mo I minus one for
20:11 - W her mo hi minus 1 this w minus W of I
20:21 - plus profit of that item fine you can
20:28 - verify this formula also suppose we are
20:30 - taking any example of this one this Phi
20:35 - this the same for this one this one
20:41 - suppose value Phi is what for value of W
20:44 - is what seven now maximum of M I minus 1
20:51 - that is 3 W is what 7 okay
20:55 - comma M hi minus 1 3 W is what 7 7 minus
21:03 - weight of I I is what for weight of I is
21:09 - what 6 7 minus 6 plus profit of I high
21:16 - value is what for here profit of this
21:19 - one is what 1 1 here what we have M of 3
21:24 - and 7
21:25 - I value is 3 here W value is 7 means
21:30 - this cell value is what 5 comma 7 minus
21:35 - 6 that is one M of 3 1 I value is 3 here
21:42 - what we have W value M here what we have
21:44 - 0 plus this one out of five and one
21:49 - which one is maximum that is 5 well how
21:52 - many be happy careful quwata fine so
21:56 - this is the formula to fill out this
21:59 - table ok now you have to find out that

25:57 - one is x3 is what 0 okay x1 x2 x3 and x4
26:03 - okay now next we have selected this one
26:07 - now what you have to do is the way it is
26:10 - what it we have selected this way that
26:13 - is five remaining way it would be 8
26:15 - minus 5 that is 3 fine now go to the
26:21 - upper row and go to the column having
26:26 - weight 3 say many weight is 3 now you
26:30 - have to go to this column this 3 the
26:33 - value is what to go to the upper row the
26:36 - value is what to will not select this
26:39 - one will not select this for go to the
26:40 - upper
26:41 - the value has been changed so we'll
26:43 - select this 3 here 3 methyl of one for
26:48 - common a select nature that is zero fine
26:51 - is common a select earlier thicken now
26:54 - what you have to do is wait is what
26:57 - corresponding to this cell is what three
26:59 - we have selected this item wait is worth
27:01 - 3 3 minus 3 that is zero now go to the
27:07 - upper row and go to the column having
