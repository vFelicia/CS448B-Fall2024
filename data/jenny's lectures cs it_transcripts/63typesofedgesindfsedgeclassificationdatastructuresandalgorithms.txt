00:00 - hi guys welcome back today's topic is
00:03 - types of edges after DFS traversal or
00:06 - depends a classification of edges of a
00:09 - graph after the DFS traversal of that
00:12 - graph DFS means depth first search
00:14 - traversal of that graph okay
00:17 - so first of all I will tell you how many
00:19 - types of edges would be there four types
00:20 - of edges would be there first one is
00:22 - tray edge second is forward edge third
00:25 - one is back edge and fourth one is cross
00:28 - edge okay now these are four types of
00:32 - edges three edges what when you traverse
00:35 - that graph or you can say when you are
00:38 - applying that DFS traversal depth-first
00:40 - search traversal okay then the edges
00:44 - which are member of the DFS traversal
00:46 - those edges would be bring edges okay
00:51 - next is forward edge we will discuss all
00:54 - the edges with the help of this example
00:55 - okay
00:56 - forward is would be what suppose we have
00:59 - an edge E or E or Phi X Y X Y X from X
01:03 - to Y okay then that edge would be called
01:07 - as forward edge in which Y appears after
01:11 - X means X Pelley inochi uske baad y a
01:15 - guy in the graph okay or appears means
01:19 - what you can say we are considerable
01:21 - consider a you know a very variable that
01:24 - is time variable okay and when you
01:26 - traverse this graph then when you
01:29 - discover any node then we would you know
01:34 - that node notice the time period time of
01:37 - that node starting time of that node end
01:39 - you can say finishing time of that node
01:41 - I'll discuss with this example so any
01:44 - edge would be any edge XY would be
01:47 - forward edge in which Y appears after X
01:50 - and there is a path from X to Y okay
01:55 - what is back edge as the name suggests
01:58 - backward edge any edge XY edge would be
02:02 - from X to Y X to Y this one is I'm
02:06 - talking about directed graph okay X Y
02:09 - where Y appears before X see
02:13 - is make about that why appears after X
02:16 - or beccaj macaca why appears before X
02:19 - and there is a path from Y to X and what
02:24 - is the cross edge any edge from X to Y
02:27 - would be a cross edge where there is no
02:29 - path from Y to X you cannot come from Y
02:33 - to X ok so let us discuss these type of
02:37 - edges with the help of this example then
02:39 - it will be laid it out see suppose this
02:42 - one is our example and we are applying
02:44 - DFS traversal on this graph first of all
02:47 - ok we will consider one variable that is
02:50 - time variable okay you will start you
02:56 - can start the DFS traversal from any
02:58 - node fine we are taking this node a as a
03:01 - starting node we are starting our DFS
03:04 - traversal from this node okay now first
03:07 - of all go to this node a and not the
03:11 - time time starting make a hugga one you
03:16 - can say the starting time of this node
03:17 - or you can say the appearing time of
03:19 - this node or you can say the discovering
03:21 - time of this node right now we are at
03:23 - this node at time stamp at time 1 okay
03:27 - just say just say I'm ugly budding a
03:28 - time will increase by 1 okay
03:31 - now we're starting time of this node is
03:34 - what 1 ok now in DFS traversal you can
03:40 - go either this side or on this side say
03:44 - there could be many DFS traversal of
03:46 - this graph I have already discussed the
03:48 - the DFS traversal method in the previous
03:51 - video I will provide you the link in the
03:53 - description box also you can check out
03:55 - that thing so there could be many DFS
03:57 - traversal of this graph I am NOT saying
03:59 - that there would be a unique DFS
04:01 - traversal but we are taking 1 DFS
04:04 - traversal ok ok I am going to this side
04:09 - you can see you can traverse this one
04:11 - from this side either to f4 either to
04:13 - the side you can go to B also I am going
04:16 - to be we are going to be so will mark
04:20 - this edge
04:23 - fine now we have reached to be means you
04:28 - have discovered this be then time of
04:30 - order you can say the starting time of
04:32 - this node-based what - will increase the
04:36 - time by one that is - okay
04:41 - next starting time of - is what sorry B
04:46 - is what - now from B where you can go in
04:49 - DFS traversal we can go to see only fine
04:53 - now we will move to C and this will mark
04:56 - this edge alright we have reached to see
05:01 - now so the starting time over you can
05:03 - see the peering time of C becomes 3 now
05:08 - time will increase by 1 now from see
05:12 - where you can go you can go either to be
05:14 - or to e find your two choices let us
05:19 - suppose we are going to we are
05:21 - traversing this e through this edge now
05:25 - we have reached to this you know what is
05:28 - the appearing time also the discovering
05:30 - time of this is what or you can say the
05:31 - starting time of e fine three top not
05:36 - starting time would be now four okay now
05:40 - from II can you go anywhere
05:42 - is there any outgoing edge no there is
05:44 - no outgoing is we cannot go anywhere we
05:47 - cannot traverse the graph now now you
05:50 - have to do what backpack fine now in
05:54 - backtracking where you will go will go
05:59 - to this C and before backtracking will
06:02 - increase the time okay
06:04 - now starting time of this is what for
06:07 - now we can not go anywhere from this e
06:10 - so you can say this has been finished so
06:13 - you can say the finishing time of this e
06:15 - is what fine angle increase by one
06:21 - finishing time a public okay when you
06:23 - are not able to move forward from that
06:26 - node and you have to backtrack from that
06:29 - node fine
06:31 - okay the finishing time of this is what
06:33 - five now we have to backtrack we have
06:35 - reached back to say
06:37 - now can you war anywhere from sea yes we
06:40 - can go to this way right we can mark
06:44 - this engine we have reached to D now
06:48 - what is the discovering or the starting
06:50 - time but you can say the appearing time
06:52 - of B is what five then next is what six
06:57 - okay six is the appearing time of this T
07:00 - okay now from B where you can go there
07:05 - is only one outgoing is and that is
07:07 - going to be can we go from D to B no we
07:11 - cannot go because B is already traversed
07:13 - so we are not we cannot go to be okay
07:17 - now from B we cannot go anywhere so this
07:20 - is now you can say that D has been
07:21 - finished or the finishing time of this B
07:24 - would be seven now you would backtrack
07:29 - and now we have reached to back to C
07:33 - okay now check out is there any
07:36 - remaining node you can traverse from C
07:38 - no thus node is already traverse this
07:41 - node is all new traversed we cannot go
07:42 - anywhere you have to backtrack so this
07:45 - is also finished the traversing or you
07:47 - can say the exploring of this node is
07:48 - also finished that is why we right now
07:51 - the finishing time of the C and this
07:53 - would be eight seven to eight now from
07:57 - see your backtrack we have reached to
08:01 - this B can we go anywhere from this be
08:04 - no we cannot go because C has been
08:06 - already traversed we have to backtrack
08:08 - before backtracking build you know this
08:11 - has been finished then we will write
08:13 - down the finishing time of this B would
08:15 - be nine okay now from B can you go
08:21 - anywhere else no backtrack backtrack to
08:24 - a now from a can you go anywhere else
08:29 - can you traverse any other node yes we
08:32 - still have one node that is F so we will
08:35 - not pride the finishing time of a
08:37 - because a has not been finished still we
08:39 - have some node that are yet to be
08:43 - traversed okay now we will go to this
08:46 - side B will mark this edge
08:50 - right now we have reached 2f what is the
08:54 - starting time of this F now 9 to 10 it
08:58 - has it is now 10 starting time of it now
09:02 - next where we can go to we can go to G
09:06 - and we'll mark this edge we have reached
09:09 - to this G starting time of G would be
09:13 - now 11 now from G where you can go you
09:17 - can go either to L 2 H or to M you have
09:22 - three options you can go to any node
09:25 - suppose we are traversing this node L we
09:27 - are going to L now what is the starting
09:29 - time of L we have marked the said
09:32 - starting time of L would be 2 L now
09:35 - because is Kyle eventhough now one
09:37 - increase over that would be too well now
09:39 - now from L where you can go we cannot go
09:43 - anywhere because there is no outgoing
09:45 - edge so this has been finished reversing
09:47 - or for exploring of this node has been
09:49 - finished because we cannot go anywhere
09:51 - forward so we have to backtrack and
09:57 - before backtracking will write down the
09:59 - finishing time of the cell finishing
10:01 - time will be what 13 now backtrack to G
10:06 - from G is there any node where you can
10:09 - go yes we can go to H or you can go to
10:12 - and we have still two choices now
10:15 - suppose we are going to this H and will
10:18 - mark this edge now we are going to this
10:21 - H what is the starting time of H that
10:25 - would be 14 because third time of Nakata
10:29 - pot you go to 13 now next is 40 now from
10:33 - H where you can go you can go either to
10:34 - K or either to I you have two choices
10:37 - suppose we are taking this route we are
10:40 - traversing this I what is the starting
10:42 - time of I now that would be 15 from I
10:47 - where you can go you can go to jail only
10:50 - or you can say you can traverse this J
10:53 - only so mark this edge and we are going
10:57 - to take what is the starting time of
10:59 - this J now that would be 16
11:03 - okay now from Jay we are at this node
11:06 - now Jay you can go anywhere can you go
11:08 - anywhere no we don't have any other
11:10 - choice you how to back path so you can
11:12 - say this node has been finished
11:14 - so the finishing time of Jay would be 17
11:18 - and now we have to backtrack
11:21 - okay backtrack - I okay now from I can
11:25 - you go anywhere else
11:26 - oh yes we can go to this ones we have
11:31 - one outgoing edge but will you go to
11:33 - this node no because this node has
11:35 - already been visited we this has
11:37 - starting timers and in time this node
11:40 - has already been visited so we will not
11:41 - go to this node is there an end this has
11:45 - been finished
11:45 - so the finishing time of this I would be
11:50 - 18 now we have to backtrack to this H
11:57 - okay from H can you go anywhere else is
12:01 - there any node still remaining left yes
12:03 - we can traverse this node we can go to K
12:07 - will mark this edge and we'll go to K
12:11 - now now what is the starting time of K
12:14 - that would be 19 because we have time
12:17 - has been raised to 18 now that would be
12:19 - 19 okay now from K can you go anywhere
12:23 - else yes we have two outgoing edges to M
12:25 - into L but we cannot go to L because
12:27 - this node has already been traversed we
12:30 - will go to this M and mark this edge now
12:34 - what is the appearing time or you can
12:36 - say starting time of M would be 20 fine
12:41 - now check out can you go anywhere else
12:43 - from this M yes we have two edges two
12:46 - outgoing edges to I into H but we cannot
12:50 - reverse this I because this has already
12:52 - been visited we cannot go to H because
12:54 - so this has already been visited
12:56 - traversed so we cannot go anywhere else
12:58 - from M this has been finished
13:00 - so the finishing time of the same would
13:03 - be 21 and we have to backtrack now there
13:06 - we will backtrack - okay fine now from K
13:12 - can you go anywhere else no we cannot go
13:15 - to L this has
13:16 - visited so the finishing time of K would
13:19 - be 22 and we have to backtrack now from
13:26 - edge can you go anywhere else no we
13:28 - cannot go anywhere else so the finishing
13:32 - time of H would be 23 we have to
13:37 - backtrack we'll go to G after
13:41 - backtracking now explore this G also can
13:45 - you go anywhere else yes one outgoing
13:46 - edge is still remaining G - mm but we
13:51 - cannot reverse this M because this M has
13:53 - already been traversed or visited okay
13:56 - so we cannot go from G to M that is why
14:00 - G has a is also finished so finishing
14:03 - time of this G would be 24 we have to
14:08 - backtrack we are now at this place at F
14:13 - is there any node left which you can
14:17 - traverse no there is no node left from
14:19 - if you can go so the finishing time of F
14:22 - would be 25 and we would backtrack to a
14:26 - and the finally a is also finished and
14:30 - the finishing time of a would be 26
14:34 - so this is the DFS traversal of this
14:36 - graph now you have to find out the
14:40 - different type of edges see first of all
14:45 - what is pre edge jitney B edges up knee
14:49 - marquee and the edges which are a member
14:51 - of DFS traversal during the DFS
14:53 - traversal jitney B edges up knee visit
14:56 - curry him take a yeah p.m. neon go mark
14:59 - earlier those edges would be reiatives
15:02 - okay and out of remaining edges you have
15:06 - to find out which one is forward edge
15:08 - which one is back edge and which one is
15:10 - cross edge okay so I'm just writing the
15:14 - tree edges pre edges con con seen happen
15:17 - upon how the tree edges would be see
15:20 - this edges common mark and the edges
15:22 - which are member of DFS traversal how
15:24 - many edges are there this one aibee
15:27 - aibee
15:28 - BC BC c e c d e f FG g l GH h i i J H K
15:39 - and K M these are 23 edges now what are
15:44 - remaining edges and the edges which are
15:48 - you know in this read reading those are
15:53 - not under the tree edges those are still
15:56 - left and out of these edges you have to
15:59 - find out which one is forward which one
16:01 - is back as in which one is cross edge
16:03 - let us take example let us take we are
16:06 - just taking this edge D to be now this
16:11 - one is backward edge or forward edge or
16:13 - crosses you how you have to find it out
16:15 - d e C directed edge here to arrow is
16:19 - from D to e now here how will find out
16:25 - edge of nikki ahead d be this one d be
16:32 - so here X is what B and Y is y is what
16:38 - be fine I put the answer take nap case I
16:42 - find out kuruvi X is this one and Y is
16:45 - this one X Y take a now find out X
16:50 - appears first before Y or Y appears
16:52 - before X you guess I find out who you
16:54 - have knew how to check the starting time
16:56 - by checking the starting time X up ahead
17:00 - dy o Kekaha be starting time of B is
17:03 - what - and starting time of this D is
17:06 - what six starting time of B is less okay
17:10 - starting time either become high it
17:12 - means what B appears before D fine
17:19 - it means Y appears before X or Y a case
17:24 - may have car y appears before X fine and
17:29 - the second condition involved there is a
17:31 - path from Y to X now here y is what B is
17:35 - there any path from this B to D yes you
17:39 - can go from B to C then C to
17:42 - d there is a path from here to here from
17:46 - Y to X so this edge is what back H fine
17:53 - this would be what back edge
18:06 - this DB let us take one more edge let us
18:10 - take this one be e de as is from D to e
18:18 - here X is what B and Y is what e find
18:22 - out which one appears first starting
18:24 - time of e is for starting time of days
18:26 - six fine starting time of E is less than
18:30 - starting time of day it means e appears
18:33 - before be right means y Y appears before
18:41 - X Y appears before X okay but you have
18:49 - to check the second condition also there
18:51 - is a path from Y to X here Y is what e
18:54 - is there any path from e to be sorry E -
18:59 - D no we cannot go from E to D there is
19:03 - no path so you cannot say this one is
19:05 - back edge this one is what cross edge C
19:09 - cross edge edge would be X to Y where
19:12 - there is no path from Y to X you cannot
19:16 - move from Y to X so this edges what
19:23 - cross edge okay now let us take this one
19:28 - H - f H - f here X is what H and Y is
19:40 - what F find out which appears first H -
19:45 - f starting time of F is less than
19:48 - starting time of H it means f appears
19:51 - before H it means Y appears before X Y
19:57 - appears before X this is what it should
20:00 - be back edge but you have to sec check
20:03 - the second conditional so there is a
20:04 - path from Y to X now here Y is what F is
20:09 - there any part from F to H yes you can
20:12 - go F to G then G to H both condition has
20:16 - been satisfied so this one is what
20:21 - package this one is also back edge okay
20:25 - let us take this one g2m okay g2m edges
20:33 - from g2m direct edge here 2x would be
20:37 - what g + y would be here m find out
20:42 - which appears first starting time of g
20:45 - is 11 starting time of AF is sorry ms-20
20:49 - so g appears before M or G has been
20:54 - discovered before to be starting times
20:56 - Youkilis A to G paheli I have Skiba a
20:58 - Maya
20:58 - it means Yahweh gkx X appears before y
21:05 - SI y appears after x or the second is
21:09 - what X appears before why here why
21:12 - appears after X fine and there is a path
21:16 - from X to Y obviously there is a path
21:18 - direct path he hates me take our Y a
21:20 - path vo Sofia this is from X to Y and
21:23 - this is also not a part of three edge is
21:27 - my second up third condition kyoki that
21:30 - edge should not be the part of tree edge
21:33 - G to M yep car tree edge mean he has so
21:36 - this would be what a key a consuming
21:39 - forward edge GM Valley que Haga apply
21:46 - forward edge let us take this one this
21:49 - case M to I edges what M I X is what M
22:00 - and y is what I M to I which appears
22:04 - first starting time of is 15 starting
22:07 - time of this one is 20 means I appears
22:10 - before M it means y uki apna caja why
22:16 - why appears before x y appears before x
22:21 - take the second condition there is a
22:24 - path from Y to X here Y is what I why is
22:28 - there any path from I to M
22:31 - check out
22:33 - I you can go to jail but Jessica
22:35 - University from I you can go to D from D
22:38 - you can go to either E but I get couch
22:40 - neither asset F from D you can go to BBC
22:43 - up see just at the or D and E no you
22:46 - cannot go from I to M so there is no
22:49 - path from Y to X so this cannot be back
22:53 - edge say one condition is true that is
22:55 - why appears before X but second
22:57 - condition is not true there is no path
22:58 - from Y to X so we cannot say say this
23:00 - one is back is this one is what cross
23:03 - hinge okay check out this one I to D X
23:13 - is what I this one is y so here also Y
23:17 - appears by appears after Y appears
23:20 - before X because beaker starting time is
23:23 - 6
23:24 - I guess starting time is 15 so I to D X
23:27 - 2y y appears before this X Y appears
23:32 - before X is there any path from b2i can
23:37 - we go check out they say I'm a just
23:40 - something but I am kinda just after D
23:42 - say we can go to BBC MCC say yoga sucked
23:45 - a bit we cannot go from D to I there is
23:48 - no path from Y to X so this is also what
23:51 - cross hence this I to D this is also
23:55 - what cross H so like this you can find
23:59 - out so we have one remaining lip that is
24:02 - M to H X to Y here also this y this is y
24:08 - now the Y car starting time is 14x car
24:11 - starting time is 4:20 y appears before x
24:14 - y appears before x check out is there
24:17 - any path from Y to X can you go from H
24:20 - to M yes there is a path you can go to
24:22 - this K then to M so this this s would be
24:26 - what back edge ok now this is the list
24:35 - of edges 3 edges forward edges only one
24:38 - g2m back edges will be DB hf n MH &
24:42 - Crofts edge would be be
24:43 - kay lmin Heidi see this is also
24:47 - remaining k2l this one is also remaining
24:50 - this is not under the free edge from k2l
24:53 - xsk this one is why and here what is
24:56 - apparent time of X is 19 appearing time
24:59 - of y is what - well it means Y appears
25:02 - before X Y appears before X you have to
25:07 - check second condition is there any path
25:08 - from Y to X means L 2 K can you go from
25:11 - L to K no we cannot go from L to K that
25:14 - is why it is known as what cross edge
25:16 - fine so this is the this is the list of
25:19 - edges and the one more condition is what
25:22 - union of all the four type of edges
25:26 - would be what all the edges in the graph
25:30 - if you do the union of three edges
25:33 - forward edge back edge and cross edge in
