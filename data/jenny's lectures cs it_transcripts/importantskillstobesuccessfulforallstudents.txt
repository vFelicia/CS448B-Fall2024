03:13 - important
03:14 - to develop these skills at least public
03:17 - speaking
03:18 - skills you have to get rid of your
03:20 - public speaking phobia that
03:22 - stage phobia if you have and it is a
03:25 - great time you will not get time after
03:28 - the college if you are maybe many
03:30 - students are like you know very
03:32 - shy in nature they hesitate they think
03:33 - that they think that
03:35 - others will laugh if you speak or if you
03:37 - speak in english because your english is
03:39 - not
03:39 - uh so fluent that is why i have
03:42 - combined these two points like public
03:44 - speaking and english speaking
03:46 - if your spoken english is good
03:47 - definitely you will be
03:49 - you will feel much confident you will
03:51 - feel more confident
03:52 - you will feel more confident in speaking
03:54 - in public and see these skills will be
03:56 - required when you are going to sit for
03:58 - campus placement or when you are going
03:59 - to
04:00 - uh you know go for off-campus placement
04:02 - or
04:03 - to get a job these skills are very
04:04 - important and obviously these skills are
04:07 - like public speaking is also important
04:08 - in
04:09 - later in your life also it's not just
04:11 - for the job purpose
04:13 - right so and it's not like that it is
04:15 - just a crash
04:16 - course you can do 10 uh days and 15 days
04:19 - course and your communication skills
04:20 - your public speaking
04:21 - spec skills and your english is so
04:23 - fluent no it takes time
04:26 - it takes time to develop these
04:27 - communication skills it takes time to
04:29 - get rid of your
04:31 - stage phobia that public speaking phobia
04:33 - it takes time to be fluent in
04:35 - english spoken english so it takes time
04:37 - as well as it takes
04:38 - practice that and you have time now
04:40 - during your college years
04:42 - right so please work on these skills
04:44 - what you can do
04:46 - you can just give some presentations in
04:48 - your class you can host any event
04:50 - you can give a speech on any uh
04:53 - function i know many students do what if
04:55 - today it's your turn suppose for
04:57 - uh to give presentation in your class
04:59 - then you bunk that class on that day
05:00 - right
05:01 - but it's your biggest mistake you are
05:03 - doing
05:04 - it's okay if students will laugh and
05:06 - everybody is like you
05:07 - see it it is the right time to get rid
05:10 - of your fear
05:11 - because later you will not get time and
05:14 - it would be really problematic for you
05:16 - in your job so better to develop these
05:20 - skills during your college time
05:21 - second thing is management skills
05:25 - see please don't think that management
05:26 - skills are only for mba
05:28 - this is limited for mba students no
05:30 - these are also required for you also
05:32 - every student for everyone management
05:34 - skills are required
05:36 - it's not like that it is required only
05:38 - to get a job or during your job but it
05:40 - is also very necessary
05:42 - in your life also obviously in your life
05:44 - also you have to manage
05:46 - many things so better to learn
05:48 - management skills
05:49 - in your college time once also only so
05:52 - what you can do
05:52 - there are many events in colleges many
05:54 - festival manifest and every uh thing
05:57 - so you can do what you can just be
05:59 - volunteered you can manage
06:00 - any event or you can host anything you
06:03 - can manage any
06:04 - exhibition or these kind of things see
06:06 - many activities are there in colleges so
06:08 - you can just manage you
06:09 - in a single activity so you will get
06:10 - some experience
06:12 - how to manage things what kind of
06:15 - problems you
06:16 - you can face during this during that
06:19 - management so you will learn something
06:21 - so management skills are also required
06:23 - and you have to develop these in your
06:25 - college days only
06:26 - because it's a great time next is make a
06:29 - habit to maintain a to-do list maybe you
06:31 - are thinking
06:32 - we don't need to maintain a to-do list
06:34 - because we remember
06:35 - everything what we have to do today but
06:38 - see sometimes you forgot maybe if you
06:41 - have to
06:42 - submit any assignment or maybe if we
06:44 - take example during
06:45 - of your study related then and if you
06:48 - have to submit any synopsis of any
06:49 - project or
06:50 - anything and you forgot and on the same
06:53 - day or maybe one day before you remember
06:55 - like oh i have to do
06:56 - uh this also and maybe at that at last
06:59 - moment you don't get time to do that
07:01 - thing so better to maintain a to-do list
07:04 - just what you need to do today and once
07:06 - you complete those tasks you can just
07:08 - yeah i have done this thing so it's like
07:11 - you will be habitual of organizing
07:13 - everything so that would be good see
07:15 - because
07:16 - yeah if you are in college if you forgot
07:18 - something it's okay if you suppose
07:20 - forgot to uh submit any assignment or
07:22 - quiz or any synopsis of project or
07:24 - anything
07:24 - it's okay for this time only but when
07:27 - you will
07:28 - get into that job then you will have to
07:30 - get serious things are
07:32 - things will get serious at that time
07:33 - because they are paying for you for the
07:35 - work and if you forgot something if the
07:37 - deadline
07:37 - you have to submit some work and the
07:39 - deadline is today and you forgot that
07:42 - work to do then it's it is going to harm
07:45 - you it is going to harm your career
07:47 - maybe they can fire you or if they will
07:49 - not fire you
07:51 - then definitely it is going to harm you
07:54 - during your promotion these kind of
07:56 - things so better
07:58 - to make a habit during your college time
08:00 - only to maintain a to-do list
08:03 - so that you remember everything yeah i
08:04 - have to do this this this today
08:07 - and next is it is related to this to-do
08:09 - list
08:10 - next is try to complete your task
08:13 - immediately
08:14 - or get it early get it done early don't
08:17 - think yeah i have much time
08:19 - tomorrow i'll do this or tomorrow you'll
08:21 - think tomorrow i'll do this
08:23 - and your tomorrow will never come right
08:25 - so suppose you have to submit
08:27 - any assignment and you have time today
08:29 - because suppose assignment date is
08:31 - after 10 days and obviously you have
08:33 - time during your college days you have
08:34 - free time
08:35 - a lot of free time so do it immediately
08:38 - or
08:39 - try to complete that assignment that
08:41 - thing as early as possible do not
08:43 - wait for the deadline it is really going
08:45 - to help help you in your
08:47 - job because there you will have to work
08:49 - under pressure
08:51 - and if at that time you will do
08:53 - calculate
08:54 - a project
08:58 - at that time once the deadline will come
09:01 - nearer you will feel
09:02 - more pressure and you will not able to
09:05 - give your hundred percent
09:07 - so better to get things early if you
09:09 - have time
09:10 - do not avoid things like tomorrow i'll
09:12 - do tomorrow i will do right
09:14 - next is and i think you should develop a
09:17 - hobie
09:17 - or anything which removes stress or
09:21 - by doing that thing you will feel fresh
09:24 - or it will make you physically active
09:27 - so you can play any game like or you can
09:30 - sing a song you can dance you can cook
09:33 - anything
09:34 - which is of your interest like maybe
09:36 - playing games boys
09:37 - prefer playing cricket or playing i
09:40 - would not say
09:41 - playing video games because here i just
09:44 - want to focus on the thing which
09:45 - includes some physical activity or you
09:47 - can do
09:48 - exercise because this thing also very
09:50 - important your health is also very
09:52 - important so you should take care of
09:54 - that also you should make a habit of
09:56 - doing some physical activity at least
09:58 - maybe for 15 minutes or 30 minutes from
10:01 - your college
10:02 - time only because it is the time where
10:04 - you don't care about your health
10:06 - i know everybody because of maybe
10:07 - sleeping habits or eating habits
10:09 - anything but after some time maybe after
10:12 - three years five years seven years you
10:14 - will realize that
10:15 - i should take care of my health and at
10:17 - that time it would be very
10:19 - you know tough for you to make a habit
10:21 - of doing exercise or
10:22 - anything so better to make a habit of
10:24 - doing some exercise some physical
10:25 - activity maybe some playing
10:27 - playing some game which help which you
10:29 - know requires some physical activity
10:31 - during your college time only
10:33 - so please don't put your health aside
10:35 - take care of yourself right
10:37 - so these are in my opinion some common
10:40 - or some must
10:41 - have habits for everyone for every
10:43 - student and you should develop these
10:44 - habits during your college time
10:46 - right so that's it for this video now
10:49 - i'll see you in the next video till then
10:50 - bye take
