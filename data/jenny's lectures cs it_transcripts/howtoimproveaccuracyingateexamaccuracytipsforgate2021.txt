00:00 - those who are preparing for any
00:01 - competitive exam they must be aware of
00:03 - the term
00:04 - accuracy there are two factors speed and
00:06 - accuracy for in any
00:08 - exam whether it's competitive exam or in
00:11 - your university examination or board
00:13 - examination any exam
00:15 - so there is a trade-off between these
00:16 - two factors speed and accuracy
00:18 - sometimes if you go behind speed then
00:20 - you will lose accuracy and
00:22 - if you go behind accuracy then your
00:24 - speed would be slow why
00:26 - to attempt the question paper so you
00:28 - have to balance
00:30 - these two factors speed as well as
00:33 - accuracy while you are attempting
00:35 - any exam especially any competitive exam
00:38 - so today in this video i'm going to
00:40 - discuss some tips to improve your
00:42 - accuracy
00:44 - for gate exam gate 2021
00:47 - because accuracy is very important
00:50 - when it comes to gate examination but
00:52 - before that just want to tell you one
00:54 - thing an academy is back with an
00:56 - exciting series for isro aspirants
00:58 - named isro revised india series

01:25 - here
01:26 - but it's okay if you you can't attend
01:29 - the live test
01:30 - you can also write the test after the
01:32 - live test is over
01:34 - and this test is having 80 technical
01:37 - questions and the time limit would be 90
01:39 - minutes so it is basically to
01:41 - test your technical knowledge these
01:43 - tests have been curated and reviewed by
01:45 - the most experienced educators at an
01:47 - academy and all the tests would be in
01:49 - english plus one more thing after the
01:52 - live test is over
01:53 - there will be paper analysis by the top
01:55 - educators at an academy
01:57 - in free classes and what is the benefit
01:59 - of this paper analysis
02:00 - you will come to know your weak points
02:02 - you will come to know your area of
02:04 - improvement that would be very
02:05 - beneficial for you
02:07 - so if you are interested you can enroll
02:10 - here
02:10 - the enrollment link and all the details
02:13 - i'll give you in the description box of
02:14 - this video
02:16 - as well as the link of all the free
02:17 - classes also i'll provide in the
02:19 - description box you can go and check out
02:21 - there
02:21 - so now let us discuss some tips to
02:23 - improve your accuracy in gate
02:24 - examination
02:25 - see why accuracy is so important in gate
02:27 - examination
02:29 - because the pattern has been changed i
02:31 - guess everybody is ever aware about that
02:33 - mcq question would be there objective
02:35 - equation plus
02:36 - any question would be there numerical
02:38 - type of question
02:39 - there you need to calculate you need to
02:41 - do all the computations and you will
02:43 - have to write your answer
02:45 - for any question there would be no
02:46 - option right
02:48 - you are supposed to write your answer so
02:51 - these are calculation type of
02:53 - uh you know questions and there are
02:56 - there are chances of calculation error
02:58 - in these type of question any type of
03:00 - question so specifically
03:02 - you know accuracies required for these
03:04 - questions
03:05 - yeah it is required for every type of
03:07 - question whether it's mcqs or
03:09 - any question but specifically for nat
03:11 - question accuracy is very important
03:13 - because
03:14 - if do you do silly mistakes in
03:17 - calculation like
03:18 - maybe sometimes you do 2 plus 2 is equal
03:20 - to 5
03:21 - so because of that only you will lose
03:23 - marks so in that
03:25 - terms in calculation in computation you
03:28 - need to require
03:29 - accuracy speed is also required in gate
03:33 - examination but suppose if you have
03:34 - started your preparation just started
03:36 - your preparation
03:38 - at that time you must focus on accuracy
03:40 - more rather than speed
03:43 - because when you do practice then
03:46 - automatically speed will come
03:47 - right speed will increase so first when
03:50 - you start preparation at that time you
03:52 - must focus on accuracy while attempting
03:54 - the questions
03:55 - and then automatically uh with practice
03:57 - your speed will
03:58 - increase so first thing is what with
04:01 - practice accuracy it could also increase
04:04 - so very first thing is you need to do a
04:06 - lot of practice
04:08 - but practice like you are sitting in the
04:11 - gate exam
04:12 - like you have to create an exam type
04:15 - environment and
04:15 - then you have to do a lot of practice
04:17 - yeah it's fine if you have started just
04:20 - started the preparation like you have
04:21 - six months seven months one year or five
04:23 - months at that time
04:25 - you can solve mcqs you can practice you
04:27 - can solve any type of question without
04:29 - setting a timer or without any deadline
04:31 - without creating that exam type
04:32 - environment
04:34 - but in december and january it is very
04:36 - important
04:37 - while you do practice while you are
04:40 - maybe solving any mock test or anything
04:42 - you are taking any mock test
04:44 - that should be it's like you are taking
04:46 - you are sitting
04:47 - in that proper gate examination so how
04:50 - you can do practice like this
04:52 - you can join any test series i guess
04:55 - this thing is very important
04:57 - see in my opinion you can create
05:00 - examination if you do not join any test
05:02 - series but
05:04 - if you are above average student then
05:06 - you can just qualify gate exam
05:09 - you know you will not get good marks you
05:11 - will not get good rank
05:12 - but if you join any test series
05:16 - definitely you are going to get some
05:18 - good rank
05:19 - maybe within 50 students within 100 or
05:22 - within 10
05:24 - all india rankers right so i guess
05:27 - to get a good rank it is very important
05:29 - to join
05:31 - any test series from any you know a good
05:33 - institute repeated institute
05:35 - and it is enough to join one test series
05:38 - because it's not that you just have to
05:41 - join test series and take the test only
05:43 - you have to analyze you have to analyze
05:44 - your mistakes
05:46 - so in one test series i guess 60 to 70
05:48 - tests are there so
05:50 - if you will take daily one test then
05:52 - almost two months would be required for
05:54 - this
05:55 - right so very first is what you have to
05:58 - practice
05:59 - see the more you practice the more you
06:01 - will get better at that thing
06:03 - just you can take a simple example if
06:06 - you have started making chapatis then
06:07 - it's starting it is not possible to make
06:09 - round chapatis
06:10 - but maybe after 5 days 10 days or 15
06:13 - days definitely you will be able to make
06:15 - round chapatis that is my personal
06:17 - experience actually
06:19 - but here the thing is see if you
06:21 - practice
06:22 - then you will get familiar with that
06:24 - type of environment where
06:26 - you know that environment you are facing
06:27 - at the time of exam and while
06:30 - taking the test series while you are you
06:32 - know taking the test then maybe you can
06:34 - face as its
06:35 - different type of situation like a
06:36 - difficult type of question tricky
06:38 - question
06:39 - so rather than facing that situation
06:41 - directly in gate exam
06:42 - you know it's better to face these kind
06:44 - of situation before that
06:46 - so that you will be habitual of that
06:47 - thing and you will you know
06:50 - you know how to respond when this type
06:52 - of situation come
06:53 - you will be getting less nervous because
06:56 - of that thing
06:56 - at the time of gate examination right
06:59 - maybe
07:00 - when you are taking the test series then
07:02 - you can if you are not able to solve any
07:04 - question then you can analyze your
07:05 - mistakes
07:06 - why you was not able to solve that
07:07 - question you can again revise your
07:10 - concept
07:10 - you will also come to know this type of
07:12 - question can be asked so you would be
07:13 - prepared
07:14 - for all the things and definitely when
07:16 - you attempt the test series first time
07:18 - then you will do some silly mistakes
07:20 - so with the practice more you practice
07:23 - the silly mistakes would be reduced
07:25 - definitely
07:26 - it for your gate examination and if your
07:29 - accuracy is good then you don't need to
07:31 - you know check those entity question
07:33 - twice because those entity questions
07:35 - require
07:35 - a lot of computation and if you are good
07:38 - at accuracy if you are good at
07:39 - calculation then
07:40 - no need to check again but if you are
07:42 - not good then maybe you have to check
07:44 - two times or three times definitely
07:48 - what you will lose the time and what you
07:50 - will going to attempt
07:51 - less question than you have expected
07:54 - first thing you can do what
07:56 - solve questions while you are practicing
07:58 - at that time solve question without
08:00 - looking at
08:01 - the answers without looking at the
08:02 - options and after completely solving the
08:05 - questions like
08:06 - when you have got the answer then you
08:08 - see the options
08:09 - but it is just while you are practicing
08:12 - it is not
08:13 - when you are attempting actual gate
08:15 - examination at that time
08:17 - you need to solve any question by
08:18 - looking at the answers the options given
08:21 - because sometimes
08:22 - uh it is also possible that without
08:25 - solving the complete question you will
08:26 - get answer just by looking
08:28 - at those options those thing also will
08:31 - discuss in some
08:32 - separate video see please do not follow
08:34 - this step
08:35 - while you are attempting your gate
08:37 - examination
08:38 - this step is only when you are preparing
08:42 - for your gate examination and one more
08:44 - thing is see suppose
08:45 - if you have this type of question like
08:48 - in which you have
08:49 - decimal values two or three decimal
08:50 - values and by using those values
08:53 - you need to compute the answer something
08:55 - like this
08:56 - so and you have to round off those
08:58 - decimal values
08:59 - so please round off all the decimal
09:01 - values till
09:03 - you know same decimal point like suppose
09:05 - if you are rounding off till
09:06 - three decimal points then all the values
09:09 - would be
09:10 - rounded off till three decimal points
09:12 - it's not like that
09:13 - for one you are rounded off till two
09:15 - decimal points for second you are
09:16 - rounding off three decimal points and
09:18 - four
09:18 - third till four decimal point
09:22 - no if you do so then maybe you get
09:25 - different answer from the actual answer
09:28 - and you will think that my answer is
09:29 - correct
09:30 - next is always notice the unit in which
09:33 - answer has been
09:34 - asked this is the silly mistake many
09:37 - students do
09:39 - you have solved the question correctly
09:42 - but because of that
09:43 - unit maybe they are asking the unit the
09:46 - answer in centimeter and
09:48 - your answer is in millimeter and you
09:50 - forgot to convert it
09:52 - right so this is just a silly mistake
09:55 - and if you do so in exam it is
09:57 - definitely going to hurt you badly
10:00 - so you have to take care of this thing
10:02 - and all these things will come
10:04 - with practice so that's it for this
10:05 - video now i'll see in the next video
10:07 - till then bye take
