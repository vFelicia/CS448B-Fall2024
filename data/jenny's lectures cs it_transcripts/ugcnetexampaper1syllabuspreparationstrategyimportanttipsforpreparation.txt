00:00 - so in this series of preparation of UGC
00:03 - net exam in the previous video we have
00:05 - already discussed how to prepare for a
00:07 - paper to write that was subject specific
00:10 - for computer science I have already list
00:12 - already discussed it now in this video
00:14 - we are going to discuss how to prepare
00:15 - for paper 1 so this paper 1 is general
00:18 - paper it is not subject oriented it
00:21 - would be same for every student who is
00:24 - going to sit in that exam right so first
00:28 - thing you need to take care is what many
00:30 - students think that it is very easy no
00:32 - need to study for that many students
00:34 - think that it is very tough we can't
00:37 - clear this thing we can we can't study
00:39 - for paper one how will I study so these
00:42 - two points are myths it is not too easy
00:46 - and it is not too difficult right
00:49 - because it is for every student so they
00:53 - the level is from easy to you can say
00:55 - intermediate some questions are easier I
00:57 - would rather say very easy some
00:59 - questions would be very easy some
01:01 - questions would be of intermediate level
01:03 - but it's not like that
01:04 - the questions would be of high level or
01:06 - you know very difficult fine but in my
01:10 - first attempt I have made this mistake
01:12 - that I thought this paper one is it
01:14 - would be very easy and I'm not going to
01:16 - prepare for this one I have just
01:17 - prepared for paper 2 and because of
01:20 - paper 1 only I haven't done well in this
01:23 - paper and I was not able to crack net
01:25 - examine my first attempt but in my
01:27 - second attempt yeah at that time I have
01:31 - devoted some time for paper 1 as well so
01:34 - I'm going to share my strategy also that
01:37 - how many days I have devoted for this
01:40 - preparation of paper 1 hole where I have
01:42 - studied and everything right so very
01:45 - first thing is obviously you should have
01:48 - flavors of this one just to download the
01:52 - syllabus you should have a hard copy of
01:54 - the syllabus of paper 1 there would be
01:57 - 10 units and from each unit they are
02:01 - going to ask five questions
02:03 - right so total 50 questions would be
02:08 - there and Marx would be hundred marks
02:14 - and all questions are compulsory right
02:17 - sometimes it happens that from one unit
02:20 - they ask three to four questions and
02:22 - from another unit they ask six six to
02:24 - seven questions sometimes it happens one
02:26 - on an average they are five questions
02:28 - from each unit so you should have the
02:32 - slippers it's not like that
02:33 - just watch the YouTube videos they have
02:35 - discussed the sabersense just you have
02:37 - just started preparing for that you have
02:39 - to do yourself some work you have to be
02:42 - self you know you have to be independent
02:44 - so please download the syllabus yourself
02:47 - analyze that slippers read that slippers
02:50 - which are the units right
02:53 - second thing is now obviously how we are
02:57 - going to analyze those you know units
02:59 - because some units are easy some units
03:01 - are difficult in which the theoretical
03:04 - sections are also there the practical
03:06 - sections are also there so you have to
03:09 - download for analyzing that you have to
03:12 - download previous l question paper at
03:14 - least for five years or maybe for ten
03:18 - years right but at least five year
03:20 - question previous education papers first
03:22 - download right and if you think that you
03:24 - are smart enough there is no need to
03:26 - study for paper one you can do what just
03:29 - in time or just set one R because for
03:32 - this yeah time would be sixty minutes
03:34 - you have to be only sixty minutes and
03:38 - two hours for paper to 3 R would be
03:41 - there and now it would be on
03:44 - computer-based the paper would be
03:45 - computer-based and there would be no gap
03:48 - between paper 1 and paper to write
03:49 - continuously for 3 hours there would be
03:51 - two papers but you have to make sure you
03:54 - have to be wood only one are for paper
03:56 - one and two are so paper 2 so set timer
04:00 - for 1 R take one paper previous L
04:03 - question paper and try to soul and see
04:05 - how many questions are correct right
04:07 - second paper also and see how many
04:10 - questions are correct at that time you
04:11 - will realize that where you are standing
04:13 - if you have to mean
04:15 - you need to prepare for paper one or not
04:17 - it's up to you only like maybe you are
04:19 - smart enough you are extraordinary
04:20 - students and without preparation you
04:23 - will get maybe 60 marks or 50-plus marks
04:26 - in paper one that is also fine without
04:28 - preparation you are getting 50-plus
04:29 - marks so likewise solve all the question
04:33 - paper all the pipe here question paper
04:36 - means tenth question paper would be
04:37 - there and see where you are standing if
04:40 - you are getting good marks like 50 60
04:43 - marks then that is fine no need to
04:45 - prepare right and if you are getting
04:47 - less marks means obviously you will know
04:49 - now where your weak points and your
04:51 - strong points so now what you have to do
04:53 - from these 10 units when you will
04:56 - analyze when you solve the previous
04:58 - equation paper you will see that which
04:59 - type of questions are being asked from
05:01 - each units SI unit should be something
05:04 - like teaching aptitude research aptitude
05:07 - your communication your reading
05:09 - comprehension your ICT your you can say
05:12 - higher education and reasoning also maps
05:15 - reasoning logical reasoning and people
05:18 - and environment and government policies
05:20 - these 10 units would be there right so
05:23 - according to that you can decide which
05:24 - is easy for you and which unit is
05:26 - difficult for you for me
05:28 - easy units was actually teaching
05:31 - aptitude research aptitude and
05:34 - comprehension and ICT analogical
05:38 - reasoning you can see I was in teaching
05:40 - field so I was aware about something you
05:43 - know something about teaching research
05:45 - because I have been mtech so I have gone
05:47 - through the research process so I was
05:49 - also familiar with the research concepts
05:51 - comprehension is I think easy for
05:54 - everyone you are not supposed to prepare
05:56 - prepare for this one because we have
05:57 - practiced in your childhood many and
05:59 - seen messages one message will be there
06:01 - and questions will be there and from
06:03 - that message you have to read that
06:04 - message and you have to answer the
06:05 - questions right so I think at that time
06:07 - only you will you can answer the
06:09 - questions at least two questions would
06:12 - be very easy within the first two to
06:15 - three lines will get the answers maybe
06:17 - three questions would be a little bit
06:19 - tough you are not getting the answer but
06:20 - two questions would be very easy right
06:22 - but you don't have to devote much time
06:25 - at the time of you know
06:27 - attempting your
06:29 - having be able to manage the find how
06:31 - you should attempt the question paper
06:32 - that also will discuss in next video
06:34 - right and for me difficult was obviously
06:37 - be I was difficult data interpretation
06:39 - right maths was a little bit difficult
06:42 - match reasoning and higher education
06:45 - system people environment and government
06:48 - policies because see these are of you
06:50 - know higher education and people
06:53 - environment and government policies from
06:54 - these sections generally one or two
06:58 - question would be from you know general
07:00 - of a general awareness or current
07:03 - affairs regarding that right so
07:05 - obviously we are not much familiar with
07:07 - these kind of things
07:08 - the I in maths was also difficult and
07:10 - one is communication that is I can say
07:13 - it's difficult and I can't say it's easy
07:15 - but I put it in difficult section for me
07:18 - so according to you you how to decide in
07:21 - which section which sections are easy
07:24 - for you which are difficult for you plus
07:26 - in which section you are strong and in
07:30 - which section you are weak because you
07:32 - have to devote more time in preparing
07:35 - those units in which you are strong you
07:38 - have to focus on that thing just one
07:41 - more thing many students think that
07:43 - general awareness is also very important
07:46 - for this thing or current affairs and
07:47 - they devote much more time for current
07:50 - affairs and general awareness so there
07:52 - would be no such you know separate
07:55 - section for current affairs and general
07:57 - awareness from these sections only from
08:00 - these I guess they'll ask one or two
08:01 - questions that would be based on current
08:04 - affairs right so please do not devote
08:09 - much time to prepare for those things
08:11 - because in this case you have to know
08:13 - remember I think dates right
08:16 - and thus current affairs and general
08:19 - awareness this is very vast thing we can
08:21 - if we cannot set any boundaries and at
08:24 - that time only if you have read many
08:26 - many current appears in that case also
08:29 - it is not
08:30 - charities that you are going to solve
08:33 - and you can solve the questions in the
08:35 - exam I would rather say don't waste your
08:38 - time in preparing more and more in
08:40 - general right now see in this practical
08:44 - would be practical section would be your
08:47 - di your maths your reasoning and these
08:50 - all are what
08:51 - theoretical sections right so and I
08:55 - think teaching up into the saw
08:57 - substitude and these ICT from ICT they
09:01 - last simple you know computer related
09:04 - questions or many times simply they last
09:06 - the full form or even PDF at least two
09:09 - questions would be very easy so for
09:11 - computer science students it is a plus
09:13 - point because they know the terms they
09:15 - are familiar with the computer related
09:16 - terms IT terms maybe who those who are
09:19 - not from some little background maybe
09:21 - ICT would be in difficult section for
09:24 - those so according to you you have to
09:26 - decide which is easy which is difficult
09:28 - for you and in which section you are
09:30 - strong you have to devote much time on
09:32 - the strong sections and in paper please
09:35 - do not aim to solve all the 50 questions
09:38 - correctly right I'm saying correctly yes
09:42 - you have to attempt all the 50 questions
09:45 - because there would be no negative
09:47 - marking so at least try to solve all 30
09:52 - questions correctly 30 to 35 if you will
09:55 - get 60 plus score that is considered as
09:57 - a good score and if you will get 70 plus
10:00 - that is considered as a great I think
10:02 - that would be helpful in clearing the
10:06 - jrf assurance but at least at least try
10:09 - to get 30 questions correctly means 60
10:15 - marks in paper 1 and according to that
10:18 - you have to prepare your units it's not
10:21 - like that you have to prepare all the
10:22 - ten units thoroughly according to these
10:26 - questions
10:27 - means at least 6 or we can say 6 to 7
10:30 - units from these out of 10 units you
10:33 - have to prepare thoroughly right you
10:35 - should do very good in 6 to 7 units
10:37 - maybe you are not very good
10:39 - three years that is fine now on another
10:42 - doubt of many students is that how many
10:45 - arts we should study for paper one or
10:47 - should we study paper one and paper to
10:49 - regularly for three to four months or
10:52 - should we study paper one in last for
10:55 - one month or fifteen days see it depends
10:58 - totally depends on you means every
11:00 - student is having its own you know his
11:03 - own plus points and weak points his own
11:05 - capabilities you I think you should
11:08 - better know your capabilities what I
11:10 - have done is in I were just having four
11:14 - and half months of repairing net
11:15 - examined in first two to two months and
11:19 - two and half months I just focused on
11:21 - paper one after that I used to prepare
11:24 - paper 1 and paper 2 as well as at the
11:27 - same time means daily one hour for paper
11:30 - one plus seven hours or eight hours for
11:34 - paper two and at last I devote 10 days
11:38 - for paper one so I think according to me
11:43 - you can decide it yourself I think 15
11:45 - days are enough for preparation of paper
11:47 - one but you have to study regularly and
11:51 - sincerely in those 15 days if you are
11:54 - tired and you are frustrated only by
11:57 - reading your subject specific for
11:59 - subjects then you need to day one are
12:02 - you can do what you can solve the
12:03 - reasoning questions that is also fine or
12:06 - at last maybe you can devote 15 days
12:09 - regularly and sincerely for paper 1 so C
12:13 - it is it depends on you but please don't
12:15 - think that you need one month or two
12:17 - months for paper one preposition I think
12:21 - 15 days are in now from where you have
12:23 - to study paper 1c I have studied paper 1
12:26 - from most of the subjects of most of the
12:29 - units from YouTube videos only there are
12:31 - many felons who are there who are you
12:34 - know providing lectures for preparation
12:37 - of paper 1 and these are very good right
12:39 - they also give you some videos on
12:42 - previous year question paper like
12:44 - so I was yes I was having study
12:47 - materials from a paid course also but I
12:49 - think seventy to eighty percent I was
12:52 - dependent on YouTube videos
12:54 - seventy percent I have prepared over
12:55 - from YouTube videos rather than my study
12:58 - material so I think that is in just
13:02 - solving the previous circulation papers
13:04 - and good material from YouTube some good
13:08 - YouTube videos that is fine for
13:11 - preparation of paper one
13:12 - I haven't record any books but yeah I
13:15 - have heard that on the net and I mean
13:18 - many videos that habeas Madonn which is
13:20 - good for paper one so if you want to go
13:22 - for any books and you can purchase that
13:24 - book because see I cannot provide you
13:26 - any review on that book because I
13:28 - haven't gone through that book but I
13:30 - think YouTube videos and so all the
13:33 - previous educational papers are enough
13:34 - to prepare for paper one and see these
13:37 - practical sections like di your
13:39 - reasoning and match these are you know
13:42 - time-consuming sections and you need
13:44 - practice right and these are theoretical
13:48 - sections and they'll need less time to
13:51 - prepare and obviously in exam while you
13:53 - are attempting the questions they will
13:54 - need
13:55 - they'll need less time rather than
13:57 - solving these type of questions bi
13:59 - reasoning match especially these dia
14:02 - questions but at least c5 pressure would
14:05 - be there from this so at least two
14:07 - question would be there that would be
14:08 - one to progression would be there that
14:10 - would be very easy so you can solve
14:12 - those questions right but please at that
14:14 - time you are not you know you don't have
14:16 - to devote much time we don't have to
14:19 - waste much time to solve the equations
14:21 - maybe you think that you have prepared
14:23 - di well you have practice many questions
14:25 - so now in exam first of all I'll show di
14:27 - question and you have wasted much of
14:30 - your time in di a question because the
14:33 - 50 question would be there you will have
14:35 - 60 minutes right so almost one unit for
14:38 - each
14:39 - sorry one minute for each question
14:41 - because at last you how to devote five
14:44 - to seven minutes just to review your
14:46 - answers and just to see that how many
14:49 - questions are on attempting and you have
14:51 - to attempt those questions just to get
14:53 - by by guessing those questions those
14:55 - answers right
14:57 - how you should attempt that we will
14:58 - discuss in the next video that's it for
15:01 - this video now I'm going to see in the
15:02 - next video of tilde nobody take care
