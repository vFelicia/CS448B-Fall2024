01:07 - work on yourself improve yourself
01:09 - upskill yourself right so you don't have
01:12 - much time and have to grow logical
01:15 - thinking and improving Python
01:17 - programming language in simple way see
01:20 - you can check out my course Python
01:22 - Programming python course that's very
01:23 - simple and Rib do how to grow logical
01:26 - thinking I have uploaded two or three
01:28 - videos you can go to my channel you can
01:30 - go to the playlist placement series and

01:46 - the problem first and on a pen and paper
01:49 - write down the solution dry run that
01:50 - code then jump to your laptop to run
01:53 - that code right the dry step that is
01:55 - very important and that is I guess the
01:57 - most underestimated step but that's very
02:01 - crucial if you want to build your logic
02:04 - build you know this logic thinking logic
02:06 - building skill right so please Dy in
02:09 - your code I think for me it had worked
02:11 - you know this step it worked
02:15 - magically right when are you going to

06:27 - I'm posting notes in Python uh uh the
06:30 - notes of python in my WhatsApp Channel
06:32 - and then I'll post C++ and C notes
06:35 - whatever notes I have I'm going to post
06:37 - in that channel and kindly make a
06:39 - playlist having DSC topic wise I guess I
06:42 - have already created a playlist of

06:51 - videos in high quality and as well as
06:54 - covering some more topics so I'm going
06:57 - to upgrade my DSA playlist I'm thinking
06:59 - about that right now and what is the
07:01 - message you want to give to your viewers
07:03 - and who was the person to give advice
07:05 - for making a YouTube channel my husband
07:08 - and the message you want to give to your

07:14 - invest your
07:22 - time your life work on yourself improve
07:24 - yourself upill
07:28 - yourself
07:29 - so figure out what is good for you
07:33 - rather than watching some random stuff
07:37 - on social media ma'am I'm in I'm bch
07:40 - first year EC Branch stent please ass me
07:43 - first and second semester exam of
07:58 - programming
08:07 - element of Statistics B thir I'm
08:10 - currently learning python from your
08:11 - videos it's very easy to understand
08:13 - you're the best teacher well thank
08:14 - you
08:19 - but element of Statistics subject I
08:23 - can't I'm sorry and please start
08:25 - teaching DSA in C++ in Hindi language
08:27 - for placement because many of us don't
08:30 - English DSA in C++ in
08:34 - Hindi I'm planning to upgrade my DSA
08:37 - playlist actually but that was in
08:39 - English but yeah I have started a Hindi
08:42 - Channel as well Jenny's lectures in
08:44 - Hindi so I'll think about this and I'll
08:48 - try my best if I got time to upload the
08:51 - same lecture in Hindi as well possible
08:54 - for a non programmer student to succeed
08:56 - in programming and get a job on that
08:57 - basis yeah of course it's possible there
08:59 - you can start and you can get a very
09:01 - good job on that basis which language
09:03 - would be first if you a beginner you
09:05 - don't know AB of coding and you want to
09:07 - go for a simple language then go for
09:09 - python otherwise either Java or C++ you
09:12 - can
09:13 - choose see go for any language and the
09:15 - basic building blob in all the languages
09:17 - are same small syntax is
09:21 - different like some operators would be
09:23 - there loops uh conditionals like IFL
09:26 - statement Loops functions these are
09:29 - building blocks of any language and
09:30 - these are almost same the concept only
09:34 - differences in the syntax a little bit
09:37 - so if you're good in any one language
09:38 - then it is very easy for you to switch
09:40 - to any other language and learn that
09:43 - language but for that you have to be
09:45 - very good command on one language right
09:50 - so either you can start python is very
09:52 - simple or Java or C++ can you come to V
09:57 - Val as a speaker you all want to meet J
09:59 - M well thank you but see I would love to
10:03 - but you know these days my schedule is a
10:06 - little bit hectic and you know some
10:09 - things are also going on behind the
10:12 - scene
10:13 - so it's not possible I think Within
10:16 - These two to 3 months but next year
10:19 - definitely I'll think about this and
10:21 - when will you start C++ please take my
10:23 - comment see I have taken your comment
10:28 - soon
10:30 - I think there are 15 to 20 lectures are
10:32 - left in Python then we'll start C++ okay
10:35 - by looking at recent TRS which career
10:37 - path will be good in the sector or
10:40 - recent Trends AI blockchain promt
10:44 - engineering data
10:46 - sence So based on your interest you can
10:50 - choose means your interest as well as
10:52 - your you know
10:54 - capability that is also very important
10:57 - let's go galaxy
