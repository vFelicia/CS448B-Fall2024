00:04 - exams and starting your summer breaks so
00:07 - I have an amazing update for you guys to
00:09 - utilize your summer break this time
00:11 - coding ninjas has come up with a Java
00:13 - guide path challenge now what is this
00:16 - Java guided path challenge the duration
00:18 - of this thing and why first of all why
00:20 - you should go for this thing what are
00:21 - the benefits you will get right and how
00:23 - you can go for this thing how to
00:24 - register the link whether you will get a
00:27 - certificate or not after completion

00:40 - very first thing is this guided path
00:42 - covers basic to advanced level topics in
00:45 - a structured way with detailed notes
00:47 - followed by some practice problems also
00:50 - so first we will get the theory part the
00:52 - notes and then mcqs and some practice
00:55 - problems right and
00:57 - all the important topics would be
01:00 - covered introductory topics like uh
01:02 - variables operators and control
01:06 - statements and then Advanced topics like
01:08 - arrays strings oops Concepts in Java
01:11 - right
01:12 - and the time to finish this scheduled
01:14 - path challenge is 25 days
01:16 - so what you have to do to be a part of
01:18 - this challenge first of all you have to
01:19 - login to code Studio and you have to
01:21 - finish finish this in next 25 days now
01:24 - how you can log in how you can go for
01:27 - this guided path let me just show you
01:29 - all the things okay so all the relevant

01:34 - this type of page would be opened and to
01:36 - be a part of this challenge you have to
01:38 - log in first to the code Studio so you
01:40 - have to log in here you can just login
01:42 - with your any account Google Facebook or
01:44 - Nokia or you can just register
01:47 - just entered your email address and then

02:02 - now let me just
02:05 - show you now you can just click on get
02:07 - started this is the guided path for
02:10 - basics of java right so they are going
02:12 - to cover all the Java Basics and
02:14 - advanced concepts right now what they
02:17 - are going to cover they have 12 modules
02:19 - in this carried path C12 modules and
02:21 - what each module contains the first one
02:23 - is Introduction to Java notes plus
02:25 - problems six nodes 12 problems so first
02:28 - as introduction just click on that you
02:30 - will get notes Here Right
02:32 - see
02:33 - the notes then you click on this arrow
02:36 - and see the left
02:38 - you will get introduction additional
02:40 - Java the next is features and use of
02:41 - java and after that you will get
02:43 - questions
02:46 - jvm so for just click on First and you
02:48 - will get a
02:50 - first you will get the query part
02:53 - then see question mcqs what does GRE
02:57 - stands for then you can just enter and
02:59 - submit you can just select your answer
03:02 - and submit so these are some questions
03:04 - then again how to run a Java code this
03:08 - about main method see the theory part
03:11 - compile and run creating
03:14 - comments everything and then mcqs you
03:16 - will get see these are the mcqs write
03:19 - like this so first query part then sum
03:22 - problems mcqs on that right
03:26 - okay now back to home and let's see
03:29 - so this is the first module the next
03:31 - module is variables and data types same
03:33 - you will get eight nodes 20 problems so
03:35 - same the introduction
03:37 - right introduction Declaration of
03:39 - variables everything
03:41 - then variable naming convention then
03:43 - keywords in Java data types in Java
03:47 - see Java keywords
03:49 - first Java keywords the query and then
03:53 - mcqs invalid variable name this is the
03:56 - McQ just select the right answer and
03:57 - submit
03:59 - same like this data types here also
04:02 - first query then mcqs then scope of the
04:05 - variable in Java type casting overflow
04:07 - under flow in Java this is the second
04:09 - module variables and
04:11 - data types then input output in Java so
04:14 - taking in how to take user input in Java
04:17 - the theory part of this and then mcqs
04:19 - mcqs plus here you will get practice
04:21 - problems see the last will get practice
04:23 - problems so some programs find area of
04:26 - rectangle let's just click on print name
04:28 - and age
04:30 - so
04:32 - like this you will get this is a problem
04:34 - statement just read this sample input
04:37 - sample output read this understand this
04:39 - and here in the right section you can
04:41 - just write down your code
04:43 - so whatever Inuit language you are
04:45 - comfortable you can select like
04:46 - JavaScript Java python C plus plus any
04:48 - language you can select of your choice
04:50 - run this and submit right so some
04:53 - practice problems also you will get here
04:56 - right now back to home and this was our
04:59 - third module then operators in Java all
05:02 - the types of populators arithmetic unary
05:03 - assignment relational logical bitwise
05:07 - everything right
05:09 - so this is this is what so whenever you
05:11 - will click on any tab the theory part
05:13 - you will get right
05:15 - and then
05:16 - after that
05:18 - problems mcqs and practice problems
05:22 - right
05:23 - now after operators control statements
05:26 - in Java
05:27 - iteration statements like if else if for
05:30 - Loop and all jump statement and then
05:32 - practice problems as well so here are
05:34 - the programs
05:35 - right
05:37 - practice problems these are some
05:40 - practice problems some of
05:42 - some of even number till n some of un
05:45 - and or so these are five or six
05:47 - fine factorial local number practice
05:49 - problems same click on any problem and
05:52 - same you will get the same screen read
05:54 - this problem statement first what are
05:56 - the input output and then you can write
05:57 - down your code here you can select your
05:59 - language
06:00 - and just
06:01 - submit that
06:03 - right
06:07 - okay now we have methods in Java types
06:10 - of methods parameters method overloading
06:12 - then practice problems then memory
06:14 - allocation then arrays strings
06:17 - then oops Concepts in Java package
06:20 - access specifier classes and objects
06:22 - static keyword final keyword Constructor
06:24 - in Java this and super keyword in Java
06:27 - encapsulation inheritance polymorphism
06:29 - abstractions all those Concepts Theory
06:32 - plus problems then exceptional handling
06:36 - right find that try catch and throw and
06:41 - this finally Block in Java then
06:43 - collection Java at last why we use
06:46 - collection in Java then like Java
06:48 - collection framework hierarchy mcqs
06:50 - collection algorithms and then example
06:52 - problems
06:54 - see you can see example problems
06:57 - right answer plus explanation
07:00 - so first of all you will get what is the
07:02 - output of the following program you can
07:03 - just try it out answer also you will get
07:05 - here and then explanation also so some
07:08 - examples problems as well
07:10 - okay so these are all 12 modules and
07:14 - after completing this course 80 percent
07:16 - see eighty percent completion of this
07:18 - course
07:20 - you will get you can download the
07:21 - certificate freely without any penalty
07:23 - but for that you have to complete this
07:24 - course 80 percent
07:26 - right
07:29 - part of this challenge you just go go
07:33 - through this one log in and go through
07:35 - this one and at last you will get the
07:37 - certificate as well as you will get some
07:39 - gifts
07:40 - rewards you can see
07:42 - top 10 winners will get some exciting
07:45 - coding images merchandise and some gift
07:48 - worth rupees twenty thousand twenty
07:51 - thousand right
07:52 - and if you have any other question you
07:54 - can go to the frequently Asked question
07:55 - and you can just check out this thing
07:58 - right so I hope this is a great way to
08:00 - utilize your summer breaks if you are
08:03 - interested in learning coding or any
08:05 - programming language like Java right so
08:08 - all the relevant links and details you
08:10 - will get in the description box of this
08:11 - video you can go and check out so now
08:12 - we'll see in the next video till bye
