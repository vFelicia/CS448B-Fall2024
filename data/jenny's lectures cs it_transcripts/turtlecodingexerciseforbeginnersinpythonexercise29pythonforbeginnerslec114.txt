00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language we are
00:04 - discussing Turtle Graphics in the
00:05 - previous video we have seen one coding
00:08 - exercise right that was very simple one
00:10 - because we have drawn a dashed line
00:13 - right so one more coding exercise we
00:16 - will see in this video and what you have
00:18 - to do what you have to draw in this case
00:20 - few shapes right let me just show you
00:22 - first so these are the shapes you have
00:25 - to draw like first Triangle Square then
00:30 - pentagon hexagon heptagon and octagon
00:33 - right or further you can row nonagon and
00:36 - deagon also right like triangle means
00:39 - having three sides then Square having
00:42 - four side then what uh Pentagon having
00:45 - five side then hexagon six side then
00:47 - heptagon like seven side and octagon
00:50 - like eight side nonagon nine side nine
00:52 - side and deagon 10 sides something like
00:55 - this and every shape should be in a
00:58 - different color any random color and
01:02 - something like
01:03 - this first this triangle then from this
01:06 - side only start a square then from this
01:09 - side only start a pentagon something
01:11 - like this this kind of shape you have to
01:13 - draw so pause the video and try this out
01:17 - so I hope you have done this see first
01:19 - of all have to find out the angle like
01:22 - if it is a square then you just have to
01:24 - move this to some specific distance like
01:27 - 100 let's suppose we are taking uh the
01:30 - sides of every shape is 100 right so 100
01:37 - will move the total 100 forward then we
01:40 - will tilt or we will move or we will you
01:42 - know change the angle by 90° because
01:45 - this angle is this angle is 90° in a
01:49 - square
01:51 - right it's 90° now
01:56 - again again this angle is obviously
01:59 - again 90° so move to right again 90°
02:02 - move to right again
02:04 - 90° okay fine so this is Pentagon next
02:07 - but so what is the angle it's not like
02:09 - we will move it's not like that in this
02:10 - case also we will move the turtle to 90°
02:13 - no then the angle is this angle see as
02:16 - you can see if we are moving forward
02:20 - here then we will move we will shift or
02:23 - we will tilt this
02:28 - sorry
02:32 - this this angle is in this case
02:38 - 72° then in hexagon it would be
02:41 - something different then how would you
02:42 - know the angle right so here the formula
02:46 - is you just have to divide 360 total is
02:49 - 360 right 360 by the number of side like
02:52 - 360 by 360 by 4 is 90 so each angle is
02:57 - 90° in a square 360 divide by in
03:01 - Pentagon we have five side divide by
03:02 - five it is
03:05 - 72 right so I hope now you would have to
03:09 - find out the angle now you can move left
03:12 - or right by that angle right so just
03:16 - find out the angle and just pass in
03:18 - bracket whatever the angle you find out
03:20 - according to the shape according to
03:21 - number of sides so let's create a new
03:26 - file here I hope you have done this if
03:29 - not then I
03:30 - I given you the hint also now you can
03:32 - pause the video and try this
03:33 - out
03:37 - so from Turtle first we will
03:43 - import Turtle
03:47 - class then we will create a turtle
03:50 - object like Tom is equal
03:54 - to Total
03:57 - fine now how to find out the
04:02 - angle angle is equal to because angle is
04:05 - not fixed here we are not just drawing
04:08 - only one shape different different shape
04:10 - we are drawing so angle is changing so
04:12 - 360 divide
04:14 - by number
04:16 - of
04:19 - sides but how to find out number of
04:21 - sides number of sides are changing in a
04:23 - triangle it's three then four then five
04:25 - then six like this right so better IDE
04:29 - is in a for Loop because range a
04:32 - function that would generate the numbers
04:35 - right so for I in
04:38 - range 3 to suppose uh
04:43 - 9 so it will generate the
04:47 - number 3 4 5 6 7
04:51 - 8 so triangle in Four Square then
04:55 - pentagon hexagon heptagon octagon right
04:58 - so here rather than the number of sides
05:01 - what we can
05:02 - do I so let's just print this angle and
05:08 - I'll show you what is happening here see
05:11 - 120° 90 72 60 51° 45° like this right so
05:18 - rather than printing the angle obviously
05:20 - we have to
05:22 - draw what
05:24 - shapes so now if in this I we have three
05:29 - so angle is 120° right now three like
05:34 - obviously in three we have obv three
05:37 - sides so one more for
05:39 - Loop
05:41 - there in
05:44 - range I whatever the I value is from the
05:48 - above for Loop we will take the I value
05:49 - I value is three so in range three so
05:52 - this will generate at first time 0 1 2
05:57 - right three time times so now three
06:01 - times this Loop would be created means
06:03 - whatever you will write here three times
06:05 - that would be generated so what you have
06:07 - to do Tom dot
06:10 - forward
06:12 - 100 right then move this to dot to right
06:18 - right by which angle by angle whatever
06:21 - angle we have calculated here angle
06:26 - right now after this you have have to do
06:30 - like you have to hold the screen so what
06:32 - we can do Tom dot screen dot main
06:37 - Loop let's run this and see what's
06:39 - happening
06:40 - here so
06:42 - yeah only one thing is remaining these
06:46 - things should be in different color
06:48 - every shape should be in different color
06:50 - we have managed to draw the shapes right
06:53 - but color each shape should be in
06:55 - different color so for that I hope you
06:58 - got till now
07:00 - these two for Loops the you know meaning
07:02 - of these two for Loops right okay let's
07:07 - take first a list of colors and from
07:10 - that list of colors obviously we can
07:12 - generate a Rand or we can pick a random
07:15 - color we have function random in random
07:18 - module we have a function choice so we
07:20 - can use that thing so here see we have
07:23 - taken a list of colors right but how
07:26 - these colors why these colors only the
07:28 - name of the color
07:30 - as I have told you if you go to this
07:33 - Turtle Graphics you can say that uh
07:36 - documentation then see if you go to this
07:39 - method pen color then see here we can
07:41 - provide color string set pen color to
07:44 - color string which is a TK color
07:46 - specification string so what is this TK
07:49 - color specification just have to search
07:50 - in Google and this is the TK color
07:54 - specification this this is the color
07:57 - list of colors in total
07:59 - valid colors you can say valid colors
08:02 - name many colors we have so from this TK
08:06 - color specification this list or this
08:09 - thing this from this database these are
08:11 - because valid colors you can just take
08:13 - out 10 15 name of the color just copy
08:16 - paste like blue four just contrl C and
08:22 - here in my list I'm going to paste it
08:25 - here at
08:27 - last blue
08:29 - four so like this I have this list of
08:32 - colors many colors I'm having here so
08:34 - randomly I'm going to choose from these
08:37 - colors every time I draw a shape for
08:40 - triangle different color for square
08:42 - different color so after calculating
08:44 - angle when you are going to draw actual
08:47 - shape this is the thing we are going to
08:49 - draw the actual shape with this for Loop
08:52 - so before this for Loop let's choose a
08:55 - color so Tom dot obviously we have to
08:59 - change pen color pen color but we are
09:01 - not giving we are not providing here any
09:03 - specific color you have to choose
09:05 - randomly So Random dot we have Choice
09:10 - function and then in this we can just
09:13 - provide the name of the list colors so
09:16 - from this list it will choose randomly
09:18 - any color right that's it let's run this
09:21 - and now
09:22 - see every shape is in different
09:25 - different color
09:27 - right so I guess we have done this thing
09:32 - right if you want to draw nonan and
09:34 - deagan as well then you can just
09:36 - increase the range here 3 to 11 so it
09:40 - will generate 8 9 10 okay nine sides
09:45 - it's non 10 sides it's
09:47 - deagan I hope you are you have managed
09:51 - to do this thing you got it I mean the
09:55 - working of this this code right if not
09:58 - just it's okay just write down this
10:00 - thing note down this thing on a paper
10:03 - and one by one dry run this what is
10:05 - happening actually then you will get it
10:07 - better
10:09 - right how to dry R let me just show you
10:12 - uh for one
10:14 - iteration okay now for I in range 3 to 9
10:17 - first it will in range range 3 to 9
10:20 - means it will generate 3 to 8 so first
10:22 - in I 3 would be there in I now we have
10:26 - here we have three so I three so this
10:30 - this this angle value is now 120 now Tom
10:33 - do pen color random dot Choice color so
10:36 - from this color list it will Choice
10:40 - means it will pick any random color
10:42 - suppose pink any random color it has
10:45 - picked pen color is now pink suppose I
10:48 - don't know randomly it will pick any
10:50 - color now for dash in I so Dash means
10:54 - here you can take any variable name also
10:55 - like i x y z or anything I'm taking this
10:58 - Dash because I'm not I don't care about
11:01 - the values what is the value here here I
11:04 - want the value of I because I have to
11:07 - calculate angle angle is equal to 360 by
11:10 - this I so I have to store this value the
11:13 - range whatever this range will generate
11:14 - in a variable so I have taken I but here
11:17 - I don't want to store this 012 value so
11:20 - I have taken nothing just
11:23 - underscore now I is here I is so it
11:28 - would be r range
11:31 - three so it will generate 0 1 2 so at
11:34 - first it will generate 0o so for zero
11:38 - for first zero first ter do forward 100
11:41 - so it will move 100 total then right
11:47 - turn right to angle angle is 120 120
11:50 - this side then so first time angle is
11:53 - 120 so it will move the turtle to the
11:55 - right by
11:57 - 120 right then we are still in this for
12:02 - Loop in this inner for Loop so next time
12:05 - first time I was Zero next time in this
12:09 - range it would be one so again yes one
12:15 - means again it will enter into this Loop
12:18 - and forward by 100 pixels and again
12:21 - again turn right to 120° then for two
12:24 - move again 100 pixels then 120° right 0
12:29 - 1 2 only three time this Loop would be
12:33 - executed means triangle would be created
12:36 - now we are done end of 012 means after
12:39 - that we are done with this for Loop
12:42 - there is no three so now exit from this
12:44 - for Loop now still we are in this outer
12:46 - for Loop so first time I was three then
12:50 - next time I would be four now same
12:53 - process would be repeated for four then
12:55 - five then 6 7 8 like this right I hope
12:57 - you got this right you can dry run this
13:00 - on you just write down this on a paper
13:02 - and dry run there right then you'll get
13:04 - it better so now that's it for this
13:06 - video uh in the next video we'll uh see
13:10 - one more coding exercise that would be a
13:12 - little bit more difficult than this one
13:14 - right so now I'll see you in the next
13:15 - Tut bye-bye take care
