00:00 - toppers are also normal person they are
00:02 - also human beings do not think that they
00:04 - have some extraordinary which you don't
00:06 - have
00:07 - only thing which they have and i guess
00:10 - you may not have is what
00:12 - dedication hard work and a smart
00:15 - strategy
00:16 - for anything these three things are very
00:19 - important
00:20 - so i guess if you are preparing for gate
00:22 - exam then
00:23 - obviously you have that dedication that
00:25 - you want to clear gate exam you want to
00:26 - crack gate exam with good rank
00:28 - just you need is what how to prepare
00:31 - smartly for that exam
00:33 - have to work hard smartly yeah you can
00:36 - do hard work but you have to add one
00:39 - more thing in
00:40 - you know that plan and that what is
00:42 - smartly
00:43 - right so in this video we are going to
00:45 - discuss those tips like
00:47 - how you can prepare smartly how you
00:50 - should prepare the subjects
00:52 - to get a very good drink or maybe only
00:54 - india rank one
00:56 - but before that just want to tell you
00:57 - one thing for gate aspirants and academy
00:59 - has started a test
01:01 - series for the most expected questions
01:03 - for gate 2021
01:06 - and it cons the series consists of three
01:08 - tests
01:09 - two tests has already been conducted and
01:11 - one test is on 28th
01:13 - of november of the subjects
01:16 - programming data structure algorithms
01:19 - operating system and discrete
01:21 - mathematics this test has been designed
01:24 - to provide you
01:25 - the most expected questions that can be
01:28 - asked in gate
01:28 - 2021 and these tests has been curated
01:32 - and reviewed by the most experienced
01:34 - educators at
01:35 - an academy the test will have 30
01:38 - question
01:38 - and the time limit would be 90 minutes
01:41 - so you can
01:42 - attend you can take the live test and if
01:45 - you take the live test then all india
01:47 - ranking would be provided to you
01:49 - and you can win some exciting prices
01:52 - some rewards
01:52 - the details of these rewards would be
01:55 - given over here you can check out
01:57 - but it's okay if you are not able to
01:59 - attend the live test
02:01 - you can also write the test after the
02:03 - live test is over
02:04 - and the test would be in english and the
02:07 - test
02:08 - is free if you want to take this test
02:10 - you don't need to pay anything
02:12 - it is completely free you just need to
02:14 - enroll
02:15 - so the all the details and the
02:17 - enrollment link i'll give you
02:19 - in the description box of this video if
02:21 - you are interested you can check out so
02:23 - now let us discuss how to secure a very
02:25 - good rank in gate
02:26 - 2021 first step is firstly prepare focus
02:30 - on those subject which are having
02:32 - higher weight is maximum weightage and
02:34 - gait examination
02:36 - like from those those subject from which
02:38 - they ask maximum number of question
02:41 - some from some subjects usually they ask
02:44 - one or two questions three or four
02:45 - question
02:46 - from some subjects five to six and
02:49 - sometimes six to seven questions
02:51 - as well right so focus on those subject
02:55 - first thoroughly prepare those subjects
02:58 - and
02:58 - how you can come to know those subjects
03:02 - obviously you have to analyze previous
03:03 - year question papers
03:06 - last 15 years question paper just take
03:09 - those question paper analyze them and
03:12 - just write down from which subject how
03:14 - many
03:15 - questions usually they ask every year so
03:17 - in gate we have three sections
03:20 - ft mathematics for computer science and
03:22 - subject specific section
03:24 - for computer science the subjects are
03:27 - these are the subjects so you have to
03:28 - prepare
03:29 - smartly see from coa
03:33 - generally three or maybe two to three
03:36 - question
03:37 - they ask and those questions are very
03:40 - tricky
03:41 - this is my personal experience whatever
03:43 - i have observed like
03:45 - many students are not able to you know
03:48 - give answer correctly for the question
03:51 - for the subjects you a subject
03:53 - so rather than focusing on the subject
03:56 - more
03:56 - you have to focus on the subjects like
03:59 - from algorithm
04:00 - programming and data structure generally
04:01 - they ask five to six question
04:03 - sometimes from toc they ask six to seven
04:06 - question
04:06 - sometimes so rather than firstly
04:10 - focusing on the subject focus on these
04:13 - subjects which are having higher
04:14 - weightage
04:16 - right as well as one more drawback
04:18 - drawback is what the questions are very
04:20 - tricky
04:21 - of co equations are very tricky and the
04:23 - question which are asked from these
04:26 - subjects those are not that much tricky
04:29 - if you have very well well prepared the
04:31 - subjects you can easily answer
04:33 - all the questions right i'm not saying
04:36 - that
04:37 - leave the subject right if you are maybe
04:39 - you are
04:40 - competing for all india rank one so it's
04:43 - not a good idea to leave any subject
04:45 - obviously if you are you know competing
04:48 - for for all india rank one then you must
04:50 - have prepared your
04:51 - you must have started your preparation
04:52 - one year ago or maybe in third year
04:54 - so you have enough time and you can
04:55 - prepare all the subjects like if you
04:57 - have suppose less time five to six
04:59 - months or maybe three or four months
05:00 - sometimes
05:01 - and you just want to crack get exam at
05:03 - that time maybe you can leave
05:04 - some subject like see where you can
05:06 - leave but your aim is all endearing one
05:08 - or
05:09 - maybe within 50 or 100 or linear rank
05:11 - then you must prepare all the subject
05:13 - but firstly prepare these subjects right
05:16 - second thing is what find out your
05:18 - strength your strong points
05:20 - maybe suppose you have prepared five or
05:22 - six subjects and you are left with
05:24 - suppose
05:25 - coa and maybe cn or
05:29 - digital logic right you have prepared
05:31 - all the subject these subject
05:33 - very well so now out of these suppose
05:35 - you are very good in
05:37 - computer network or maybe you are good
05:39 - in computer network so you should go
05:41 - first for this subject
05:43 - if you are good in digital logic you
05:44 - should go first for that subject
05:46 - see approximately 50 marks questions
05:49 - comes
05:50 - from four to five subjects sometimes
05:53 - maybe five to six subjects and that is
05:55 - true
05:56 - right so if you have prepared those five
06:00 - or six subjects very well like you can
06:03 - solve any question
06:04 - from those subjects so that is very good
06:07 - for you
06:08 - and for the remaining subjects what you
06:10 - can do see it's not like that every
06:12 - topic is important
06:14 - some topics are very important like co
06:16 - is very hard for you suppose
06:18 - right fine and tricky question generally
06:21 - they ask
06:21 - tricky question from that so you can
06:23 - observe previous your question paper
06:24 - like from which topic generally they ask
06:26 - question they ask question every time
06:29 - so prepare those the most important
06:32 - topics rather than preparing the
06:34 - complete
06:34 - you know unit or complete subject the
06:36 - whole subject
06:38 - you can do this thing if you have less
06:40 - time if you have enough time then you
06:42 - can prepare
06:43 - all the topics of that subject also but
06:46 - rather than focusing on
06:48 - these subjects the less weighted subject
06:50 - right
06:51 - and in which you are not sure you are
06:53 - not very much interested
06:54 - after preparing the main subjects five
06:58 - six
06:58 - or maybe seven subjects just go for the
07:01 - test series
07:02 - subject wise test you have to give this
07:04 - thing is very important
07:06 - subject wise as well as after
07:08 - preparation like
07:10 - in previous video also i have told you
07:11 - in december and january go for full
07:13 - length mock test
07:14 - but after preparing like algorithm
07:17 - you should go for subject-wise test
07:20 - series means for algorithm
07:23 - the test series attend or take that test
07:26 - analyze your mistakes whatever you have
07:29 - done
07:29 - wrongly and you know which type of
07:31 - questions you are not able to solve
07:33 - which type of questions can be asked
07:35 - when you take tests then you will come
07:37 - to know
07:38 - which type of questions can be asked in
07:40 - gate examination the pattern
07:42 - right so the more test you will write
07:44 - the more you practice the more you will
07:46 - get better at that thing
07:47 - at that subject so this thing is also
07:49 - very important first of all subject-wise
07:51 - test
07:52 - then at last in last two months full
07:54 - length mock test
07:55 - as well as solve previous year question
07:57 - paper gate question paper
08:00 - isro as well as tifr so that you will
08:02 - come to know this type of question can
08:04 - be asked the pattern
08:05 - so if you want to secure a very good
08:07 - rank all india rank these two points are
08:09 - very very very important i think
08:13 - if you haven't prepared any subject very
08:14 - well like thoroughly and if you have
08:16 - started
08:17 - solving previous gate question paper
08:18 - that is also fine because if you got
08:20 - stuck somewhere in any question of that
08:22 - subject
08:23 - then at that time you can read that
08:25 - topic from any book or
08:26 - whatever study material you have right
08:30 - this thing is very important you should
08:32 - start
08:33 - this solving previous year gate question
08:35 - paper role
08:36 - taking the mock test and everything as
08:39 - early as possible
08:41 - do not just wait that first of all i'll
08:43 - prepare all the subjects
08:45 - very well then only i'll start solving
08:48 - previous year question papers or isro
08:50 - question paper so
08:52 - or that mock test do not wait for this
08:55 - thing
08:56 - start as early as possible right
08:59 - next thing which is very very very
09:01 - important is what
09:02 - see sometimes the question is very easy
09:05 - but you do not remember the formula
09:09 - gate examination is what basically based
09:12 - on formulas
09:14 - less theoretical part they ask less
09:16 - theoretical type of question
09:17 - they ask they more focus on computation
09:20 - part
09:20 - right so if you do not remember the
09:23 - formula then you are not able to
09:24 - solve that question and the question is
09:27 - very easy
09:27 - maybe the formula is in your mind but
09:29 - exactly you don't remember
09:32 - sometimes maybe low base 2 or low waste
09:34 - 10
09:35 - this kind of silly things you don't
09:37 - remember
09:38 - so what you have to do you have to make
09:40 - a separate
09:41 - notebook for just formulas for each unit
09:45 - of each subjects or maybe if you know
09:48 - the short trick
09:49 - or solving any question or for any topic
09:52 - then also you can write that
09:53 - in this notebook so that you can revise
09:56 - those formulas in that tips and tricks
09:58 - those short tricks
09:59 - may be on the day of exam or one day or
10:01 - two day before exam
10:02 - you don't need to you know flip all the
10:05 - pages of your
10:06 - notes that those lengthy notes these are
10:09 - short notes handy notes
10:11 - right so this thing is also very
10:13 - important and
10:14 - see in the important subjects as well
10:17 - there
10:18 - are important topics from which every
10:21 - year they ask question
10:22 - so first focus on those topics or you
10:25 - can say specially
10:26 - focus on those topics so put your hard
10:29 - work
10:29 - in right direction it doesn't matter
10:32 - that you have prepared all the subjects
10:35 - what thing which matter is what how well
10:38 - you have prepared
10:40 - those subjects which are having higher
10:42 - weightage from which they ask
10:44 - question every time maximum number of
10:45 - question has been asked it's not like
10:47 - that
10:47 - one subject is there from which hardly
10:50 - one or two or two to three questions
10:52 - they ask
10:52 - and those are very tricky like coa and
10:54 - you have devoted
10:56 - firstly you you start preparing coa and
10:59 - you have devoted almost maybe 15 days
11:01 - one month for this subject
11:03 - and when you have started solving
11:04 - problems of this subject
11:06 - see you a subject suppose so and you are
11:08 - not able to solve those questions
11:10 - yeah they are tricky and you feel what
11:12 - demotivated like you have prepared the
11:14 - subject but you are not able to solve
11:15 - question
11:16 - so you will feel demotivated so rather
11:18 - than doing this thing
11:20 - focus on important subject first and the
11:23 - subjects which are easy like
11:25 - i think this programming data structure
11:27 - algorithm these subjects are easy
11:29 - maybe toc and compiler design are a
11:31 - little bit tough
11:33 - but maybe for some students toc is very
11:35 - easy and maybe algorithms are different
11:37 - it depends on the past person to person
11:39 - students to student
11:40 - but with the preparation you have to
11:42 - take care of some points while
11:44 - attempting gate examination that thing
11:47 - is also very important
11:49 - preparation plus how you attempt that
11:52 - exam
11:53 - on your final day so that thing how to
11:56 - attempt gate exam in the best way that
11:58 - thing will discuss in next video
12:00 - so now i'll see in the next video till
12:01 - then bye take care
