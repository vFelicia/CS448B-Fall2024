00:05 - types some important points with the
00:06 - help of example right in this video
00:08 - we'll see some questions interview
00:10 - questions that has been asked in
00:11 - technical round on enumbria type right
00:13 - and if you are aware about the
00:15 - properties of enum data type that we
00:17 - have discussed in previous video then
00:18 - you can easily answer these questions
00:20 - these are not so tough type of questions
00:23 - right so better to go for that video

02:13 - relevant links and details i'll put in
02:15 - the description box of this video you
02:16 - can go and check out now let's see those
02:19 - two questions that we are going to
02:20 - discuss those two interview questions on
02:22 - enum let me just write down though those
02:25 - questions first
02:26 - so these are two questions first we'll
02:28 - discuss this question see
02:30 - outside this main we have
02:32 - defined a data type with the help of
02:34 - this enum enum xenum right and the list
02:37 - of constant in this is what c cpp and
02:40 - java that's it now in main function i'm
02:42 - declaring a variable where of this data
02:44 - type and i'm just printing size of where
02:47 - right now what output you will get here
02:50 - what output you will get here
02:52 - first of all thing and now remember the
02:54 - property
02:55 - see whenever you declare a variable of
02:57 - this enum then at one time it can take
03:01 - only one value from out from these
03:04 - values out of these values only one
03:06 - value at a time at a time only one value
03:09 - right and by default
03:11 - this would be considered as 0 1 2
03:14 - by the compiler as in teasers zero one
03:17 - two right and the size of integer is on
03:20 - sixty four bit
03:22 - bit machine i am
03:24 - running this right so the size of it is
03:27 - four bytes so that is why size of where
03:29 - would be four bytes here
03:33 - maybe in options mcqs you will get like
03:35 - four bytes or one is like 12 bytes or
03:38 - some error these kind of things you will
03:39 - get right so the answer would be four
03:41 - bytes only it will take at one time only
03:44 - one value and the value is these are
03:45 - related with constant like zero one two
03:48 - ah sorry integers so integer is taking
03:51 - four byte in sixty four bit machine so
03:53 - it will give four bytes now if i modify
03:55 - this with this thing enum
03:58 - one more enum y enum
04:01 - and here i'm writing c
04:03 - cpp java and
04:05 - xenum
04:08 - right and in main
04:11 - i am
04:12 - i'm doing what
04:15 - why enum wire and size of where
04:19 - so what output you will get in this case
04:21 - see
04:22 - one property i have told you that in the
04:24 - same scope
04:26 - same values of these these same values
04:29 - are not allowed
04:30 - see cpp java these are
04:32 - same so it is not allowed it will give
04:34 - error but see here i'm using in enum i'm
04:37 - using another in enum this is
04:40 - another em i using this is allowed this
04:42 - will not give error but yeah these
04:44 - values are duplicate because in the same
04:47 - scope we are using two enum and these
04:49 - constant are same so it will give error
04:51 - right right
04:53 - yeah enum with an enum is allowed but
04:55 - these duplicates are not allowed
04:57 - right i hope you got this now you can
04:59 - try out this thing another thing is what
05:01 - you can remove just to this and just
05:04 - write down x enum here that's it and
05:06 - then what output you will get this is
05:07 - assignment for you
05:09 - you have to tell me in comment box
05:11 - run this program and tell me what
05:13 - you will get here size of where
05:15 - next is all this thing see here i am
05:17 - using typedef
05:19 - enum
05:20 - within the cinema the values are male
05:22 - and female only two values and
05:25 - gender name of this is gender i mean
05:27 - main function gender where i am
05:30 - declaring a variable of the senum type
05:31 - and i am assigning the value female and
05:34 - i am printing this where so now what
05:36 - output you will get
05:38 - male is zero by default female is one so
05:40 - here you will get
05:42 - one
05:43 - but you have to tell me you are supposed
05:45 - to run this program and you have to tell
05:46 - me
05:47 - the these answers are correct or not
05:49 - maybe i am wrong
05:51 - right so run these programs
05:54 - tell me you are getting you know
05:56 - error or you are getting same output or
05:58 - not maybe in this you will get error
06:00 - like here i am using only gender i am
06:02 - not using enum here but here i am using
06:04 - enum and i have told you
06:06 - in the previous video also when you are
06:07 - declaring a variable you are supposed to
06:09 - use enum
06:10 - then the name but in
06:12 - here i am using only
06:14 - i'm not using enum i'm using only gender
06:17 - so maybe you think it will give error
06:19 - just run it and if it is don't giving
06:21 - any error you are getting one then why
06:24 - you are getting correct output why it is
06:25 - not giving error why
06:29 - the answer of this question you are
06:30 - supposed to write down in common books
06:32 - right why
06:34 - if you don't know then you can ask me in
06:36 - comment box i'll tell you in a another
06:38 - video whenever we'll make another video
06:40 - then i'll tell you the answer of these
06:41 - questions right i hope not these see
06:44 - these questions i guess very simple if
06:46 - you know the properties of enum
06:48 - right then these questions are very
06:50 - simple for you guys
06:52 - so that's it for this video now and i'll
06:54 - see the next video till then bye bye
06:55 - take care
