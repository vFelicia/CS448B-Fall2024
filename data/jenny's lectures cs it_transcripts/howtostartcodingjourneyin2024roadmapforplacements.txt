00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so if you are a btech mtech
00:04 - or BC student and you want to start your
00:06 - coding journey and you want to make your
00:08 - career in this it field tech field right
00:11 - then this video is definitely going to
00:12 - help you right see once you're going to
00:15 - start your coding Journey then then many
00:17 - questions comes in your mind like which
00:19 - programming language is best for
00:20 - placement which programming language is
00:22 - in Trend right now and which in which
00:25 - field you should go which field is
00:27 - having more and more job opportunities
00:28 - in future like should you go for machine
00:31 - learning AI web development app
00:33 - development or you should you learn DSA
00:36 - and many things are in your mind right
00:39 - and you are totally
00:41 - confused see if you are that student you
00:44 - have a clear path like I won't to go in
00:46 - this field in machine learning you have
00:48 - interest then you choose that one and go
00:50 - for that thing right but 90% of students
00:53 - are still confused their ultimate goal
00:56 - is to get a good placement right to get
00:59 - a good job mainly into those top tech
01:01 - companies right they don't know like
01:04 - which domain they should go they don't
01:07 - have any you know clear
01:09 - path right so this video is for those
01:12 - confused student what should be the road
01:14 - map to get a good job how you should
01:16 - start your coding Journey what you
01:18 - should learn the resources from where
01:20 - you should learn right and what you
01:23 - should do to not quit because many
01:26 - students almost 90% students quit after
01:29 - starting their coding because yeah that
01:31 - is stuff that is for sure right so what
01:34 - you should do to motivate yourself all
01:38 - these things we'll be discussing in this
01:39 - video right so first thing is when
01:42 - you're going to start your coding
01:43 - Journey definitely first thing is you
01:45 - should pick any one language now here my
01:48 - you know uh my uh suggestion for you is
01:50 - do not just waste your time by searching
01:53 - which programming language is best which
01:54 - programming language is in Trend which
01:56 - programming language is best for
01:58 - placements right like don't waste so
02:01 - much time on these these things because
02:03 - to be very Frank there is no such best
02:06 - language right because there are many
02:09 - domains many subdomains and it's not
02:11 - like that you just learn one language
02:12 - and that's it for you guys in this
02:14 - especially in this it field yeah to
02:16 - enter into an industry into this field
02:18 - just pick one good language and that's
02:20 - it but over the period of time to you
02:24 - know uh get yourself promoted to switch
02:27 - company wise and you know to switch
02:30 - company to company and to get good
02:32 - appraisals to you have to upskill
02:34 - yourself so you have to you will have to
02:36 - learn many languages also right because
02:40 - you know technology is changing rapidly
02:42 - so you can't be just you can't be that
02:44 - you know rid like I know this language
02:45 - and I will work on that language only I
02:47 - know this framework I'll work in in this
02:49 - framework only right if you want to
02:51 - sustain in this industry for long right
02:55 - then you have to upscale
02:57 - yourself so you will learn many any
02:59 - language also over the period of time so
03:01 - there's no such like learn any uh
03:04 - there's no such rule like learn one
03:06 - language and that's it for you guys no
03:08 - right yeah but the first language you
03:11 - choose that is important one the first
03:14 - thing is if you are clear like you
03:17 - want uh you want to go in machine
03:20 - learning Direction machine learning data
03:21 - science data analyst then go for Python
03:23 - language for sure right if you are clear
03:26 - like you want to go in web development
03:28 - right go for
03:30 - JavaScript you want to go in app
03:32 - development like Android specifically in
03:35 - Android then go for Java for IOS app
03:38 - development go for Swift language right
03:40 - and there are many more languages also
03:41 - the popular one and the one language
03:44 - which is having more opportunities for
03:45 - you guys that is only I'm going to tell
03:47 - you in brief right and if specifically
03:51 - for placement you want to learn any
03:54 - language right there is no particular
03:56 - domain like in which field you want to
03:57 - go you want a good placement you want a
04:00 - good job at last in after your final
04:03 - year then go for either C++ or Java both
04:07 - are equally good and if you want to go
04:09 - for game development pick C++ that is
04:12 - good right so according to the domain
04:15 - you choose any language but if you are
04:16 - confused General thing you want to uh
04:19 - you know learn like I just want a good
04:22 - uh good job I just want to learn any
04:24 - language for placement then go for
04:25 - either C++ or Java that is best for you
04:28 - guys because yeah python is also good
04:31 - and the topmost language but see for
04:34 - placements and still for placements and
04:36 - for getting good internship you need to
04:38 - learn DSA these things so for that I
04:42 - think C++ for Java is good because they
04:44 - are faster than Python and resources on
04:46 - python to learn these DSA and all these
04:48 - are limited one now first thing you have
04:50 - picked any language go for that language
04:52 - devote one month for that language right
04:55 - learn their Basics and start learning
04:57 - small small programs now you are
04:58 - comfortable in that that language you
05:00 - know the basics right the syntax of that
05:02 - language like Loops how to use Loops
05:04 - conditional statements and variables
05:07 - what varibles keyword constant and
05:09 - functions how to use functions and all
05:10 - these things you know about that
05:11 - language now go for DSC second step is
05:14 - go for DSC DS is still relevant right
05:18 - this question is frequently Asked
05:20 - whether to go for DSA or webd see we
05:23 - can't say clearly that only DSA no
05:25 - development yeah only development no DSA
05:28 - because you have to balance both the
05:29 - things so then go for DSA you have to
05:31 - devote 3 to four months I guess for DSA
05:34 - but these are not enough right just do
05:38 - you have to grab the theory part and
05:40 - then you have to practice problems now
05:42 - the thing is from where to learn these
05:44 - things any programming language if you
05:46 - want to go or if you want to go for DSA
05:48 - or if you want to want to go for any any
05:51 - other course front end development or
05:52 - web development or any other course also
05:55 - then from where to learn see nowadays
05:58 - there are many free resources available
05:59 - right but I personally feel that if you
06:01 - want to learn something really then if
06:04 - there is a structured course on that
06:06 - thing you get structured study material
06:08 - and support and if there is someone to
06:09 - teach you from basic to Advan especially
06:11 - if you are a fresher then that would be
06:13 - more beneficial right so there is a
06:15 - platform Geeks for geks I'm sure you
06:17 - must have heard about this platform if
06:19 - you are doing like your graduation or if
06:21 - you are in this engineering field right
06:23 - they are in this field for so long in
06:25 - this Tech field and on their website you
06:28 - will get many courses structured courses
06:30 - for everything plus you can practice
06:33 - coding problems as well company wise DSA
06:35 - problems and they also you know organize
06:37 - many contest right but here now they
06:40 - they are coming with a new thing they
06:44 - 390 Challenge and what is this challenge
06:47 - if you purchase any course from Geeks
06:49 - for geeks in the month of January and
06:51 - you complete 90% of that course within
06:54 - 90 days of your date of purchase then
06:57 - you will get 90% ref fund of your fee
07:01 - paid for that particular course so you
07:03 - will get here indirectly the motivation
07:05 - to complete that course 90% of that
07:08 - course within 90 days because you want
07:10 - your money back right so the benefit is
07:13 - you will learn you buy more courses and
07:15 - you can save more and more money plus
07:17 - you will learn more and more you will
07:20 - upskill Yourself by learning many things
07:23 - right and by purchasing these courses
07:25 - and you are also saving your money as
07:27 - well right and I think see one thing I
07:30 - just want to clear this this thing is
07:32 - applicable the 90% refund is applicable
07:34 - only if you purchase any course in the
07:36 - month of January means till 31st of
07:39 - January so this thing you need to uh
07:41 - remember right and I think this is the
07:42 - best time to take this challenge because
07:44 - in January generally we we you know our
07:47 - motivation is at Peak to learn something
07:50 - we take new resolutions to you know
07:52 - become a better person to learn new
07:54 - skill to upskill ourself so it is the
07:56 - right time to take this challenge it
07:58 - will give you more motivation also right
08:01 - because once you I know if you are
08:04 - switching from like if you're learning
08:05 - any language and then go for DSA concept
08:07 - then it would be really tough for you
08:09 - guys yeah and many students think to
08:12 - quit because there to solve these
08:14 - questions DSA problems would be these
08:17 - concept of DSA are a little bit
08:19 - difficult right so you need motivation
08:22 - to continue that thing to continue
08:24 - learning you need consistency you need
08:26 - dedication you need to be regular and
08:29 - that motivation you will get if you
08:30 - purchase these kind of courses because
08:32 - you want your money back right so
08:34 - ultimately you'll be consistent you will
08:36 - be regular you'll be dedicated you will
08:37 - be you know disciplined so you can
08:41 - explore their course category and you
08:42 - can go for the any particular course in
08:44 - which you are interested see and these
08:46 - courses are definitely going to help you
08:47 - in your placement Journey no matter in
08:49 - which year you are first year second
08:50 - year third year or final year right so
08:52 - all the relevant links and description
08:54 - I'll put in the description box of this
08:55 - video you can go and check out so now
08:57 - that was our second step first was to ch
08:59 - choose any programming language to go
09:00 - for that thing second for DSA you have
09:02 - to prepare for DSA for 3 to 4 months and
09:04 - practice problems as well then third
09:06 - thing is if you have time like I'm
09:09 - giving you the complete road map it
09:11 - depends if you don't have time like if
09:14 - you are third year or final year then
09:15 - just prepare for placement and you get a
09:18 - job based on DSC only right suppose you
09:20 - have one or two small project that is
09:22 - fine but if you have time like you're
09:23 - first year student or second year
09:24 - student then third step is go for web
09:27 - development go for development right you
09:30 - can build website or you can go for app
09:32 - development but better opportunities are
09:33 - for web development right in there also
09:36 - we have front end frontend developer
09:38 - backend developer full stack developer
09:40 - right so go for that thing first HTML
09:43 - CSS that are not programming language
09:45 - that are very simple you you can go for
09:47 - that thing also then in programming
09:49 - language go for JavaScript right that is
09:52 - one of the most popular language if you
09:55 - are going for web web development right
09:58 - go for JavaScript then you can go for
09:59 - any framework start developing project
10:02 - then go for back end two things are
10:04 - there Front End plus back end right for
10:07 - back end you can go for nodejs if for
10:09 - front end you have chosen JavaScript or
10:11 - you can go for Jango if you have worked
10:13 - in on Python language then go for Django
10:15 - for back end right now if you are good
10:17 - in both front end back end you can go
10:19 - for full stack developer job also right
10:22 - and for specialist St like front- end
10:24 - developer job or backend developer job
10:26 - or full stack developer job for all
10:27 - these kind of jobs you can apply right
10:29 - start making projects small project
10:33 - basic project then some so you know
10:36 - intermediate type of project some good
10:38 - projects right explore that thing also
10:40 - DSA as well as development because both
10:43 - these two skills are still relevant when
10:46 - you are sitting in that interview of
10:49 - these on top tech companies right maybe
10:52 - some startup or small companies are just
10:55 - focusing on a particular language or a
10:57 - particular framework or a particular
10:58 - kind of things so if you're targeting
10:59 - any small company startup or a
11:01 - particular kind of role go for that
11:03 - thing only right that is fine but
11:06 - generally what is important and which is
11:09 - having more and more opportunities
11:10 - especially in those top tech companies
11:11 - fan companies that is I'm going to tell
11:13 - you in this video I'm telling you in
11:15 - this video the road map
11:16 - right so you have to balance both the
11:19 - things if you have time DSA plus
11:21 - development right then now you are in
11:24 - that position that you can get a good
11:26 - job right but still if you have time and
11:30 - you want to explore other things then
11:32 - you can go for like data science machine
11:35 - learning artificial
11:37 - intelligence right so at last in brief I
11:40 - just want to say this thing if you want
11:42 - to start your coding journey and if you
11:43 - are a fresher and if you are looking for
11:46 - those companies top tech companies Fang
11:48 - companies in starting only right then
11:50 - focus on DSA development these things
11:53 - DSA is still important right but if you
11:56 - are not so passionate about these
11:58 - companies companies and you will be fine
12:01 - with any small company or any startup
12:03 - then just be a specialist right
12:06 - specialist means just research about
12:08 - that company that uh in which language
12:10 - on which language that company Works
12:12 - which framework what type of skills are
12:14 - required for that particular role any
12:16 - particular role in that company right
12:18 - focus on that particular skills only
12:21 - right and just learn these things only
12:23 - maybe in that case DSA is not required
12:25 - only development is required and that's
12:27 - it only JavaScript based on that also
12:29 - you can get into those small companies
12:31 - or based on any particular small
12:33 - language you can learn and go into that
12:34 - companies no DS is required right and
12:36 - after one to two year in that company
12:38 - just explore things and then after you
12:41 - can switch top tech companies or any
12:44 - other company right maybe after four or
12:46 - five year of experience if you want to
12:47 - go into those those Fang companies as a
12:49 - specialist then maybe they'll not ask
12:52 - DSA question in interview but these are
12:55 - rare cases General thing I'm I I I know
12:58 - I have told you in this video right so
13:02 - that is a case you can be a specialist
13:04 - also and you can achieve a very good
13:05 - position you can get into these Fang
13:07 - companies as well you can start your
13:08 - journey right and as a generalist also
13:11 - because DSA development everyone do
13:14 - these kind of things so that are more of
13:16 - General things right do that thing also
13:18 - and you can get directly into those Fang
13:20 - companies as a fresher right so I hope
13:23 - the things which I have covered in these
13:25 - things are helpful for you guys if you
13:27 - have any other query regarding placement
13:28 - or internship you can let me know in
13:30 - comment section and I'll see you in the
13:32 - next video bye bye take care
