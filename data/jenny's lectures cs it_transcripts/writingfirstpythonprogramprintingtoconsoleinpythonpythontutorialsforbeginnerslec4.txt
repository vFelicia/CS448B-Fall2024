00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:02 - programming language
00:03 - in the previous video we have discussed
00:06 - like how to download and install
00:08 - ide for python pycharm we have installed
00:11 - and
00:12 - python interpreter you can see python
00:14 - 3.10.6 we have installed right so now i
00:18 - guess you're all set with your laptop
00:20 - you have python you have an id to write
00:22 - your programs right you have that
00:24 - interpreter also
00:26 - okay because python is an interpreted
00:28 - language so we have already
00:30 - now downloaded and installed a base
00:32 - interpreter for our python language
00:35 - i hope you have done this thing
00:37 - now in this video we'll see
00:40 - how to print something on console or you
00:44 - can say we will write our first program
00:46 - in python
00:47 - and what usually we do whenever you
00:49 - learn a new programming language the
00:50 - first program you write is you print
00:53 - that
00:54 - classical hello world
00:56 - on output screen on the console the same
00:58 - thing we will do we'll print hello world
01:01 - on the screen on the console
01:03 - right in python
01:05 - so
01:06 - to print like in c we use which function
01:09 - print a function in c plus plus we use c
01:11 - out to print something on the screen
01:14 - in python what do we use in python 3.10
01:17 - through point x
01:19 - version python 1.x python 2.x python 3.x
01:23 - but python 2.x version they have ended
01:25 - the support for python two point x uh
01:28 - version right two point one two point
01:30 - two like this
01:31 - now
01:32 - three point x we are working on three
01:35 - point ten basically the recent is three
01:36 - point ten point six
01:38 - so in this we have a function named
01:41 - print
01:42 - this is the function print
01:46 - so this we use to print something on the
01:48 - console
01:49 - okay
01:50 - now don't need to read and don't need to
01:52 - write any header file or anything or
01:54 - main function or anything
01:56 - simply you need to write
01:58 - what
02:00 - print whatever you want to print
02:03 - the string or you can say the string
02:06 - or whatever message you want to print
02:08 - that we will put here
02:11 - within these parentheses
02:13 - okay
02:14 - so i want to print hello world so simply
02:17 - in double quotes i'll write
02:19 - hello world
02:24 - that's it no semicolon nothing else
02:27 - if you will run this on your output
02:29 - screen you will get this program this
02:31 - output hello world
02:33 - if you don't print anything if simply
02:36 - you write print and you click on run
02:40 - on that file suppose i have a file the
02:42 - extension of python file is dot py right
02:45 - so
02:46 - we are simply running this thing
02:49 - empty parenthesis
02:51 - it's okay it will run
02:54 - what it will print just a blank line
02:58 - okay
02:59 - nothing would be shown just a blank line
03:02 - cursor would be here nothing would be
03:03 - shown
03:05 - if i want if you execute two print
03:07 - function then one and two two blank line
03:09 - would be shown something like this
03:12 - right
03:14 - so
03:14 - you can say it will
03:16 - the sprint function
03:18 - will produce
03:19 - an invisible new line
03:22 - character new line means add a new line
03:24 - so it will produce an invisible new line
03:27 - character
03:29 - because of that new line character we
03:32 - see
03:32 - you know
03:33 - a
03:34 - new blank line on your screen
03:37 - right i'll show you practically also
03:39 - now whatever you want to print you just
03:41 - write within these
03:44 - codes
03:45 - we let hello world simply write hello
03:47 - world so now let me do some experiment
03:50 - with this uh
03:51 - what you have to write down this how you
03:53 - can write down this thing if you don't
03:55 - put this closing
03:58 - codes what type of error you will get
04:00 - and these things let's just do practical
04:03 - on this
04:04 - uh print function and see before going
04:06 - to practical let me just this this is
04:08 - what in python the syntax is python in
04:10 - python 3 3.x in python two point x the
04:14 - previous uh versions
04:16 - print was just a statement it was not a
04:19 - function so what we used to write in
04:21 - that case print
04:22 - and
04:24 - hello world whatever you need to print
04:26 - you can just
04:28 - write down in these quotes so print
04:30 - hello world that's it no parenthesis
04:33 - so it was considered it was as a
04:35 - statement in python 2.x but here in
04:38 - python 3 it is
04:40 - a function so if you are using python 3
04:43 - point x version right then if you write
04:45 - something like this if you don't put
04:47 - these parentheses you will get
04:49 - error message syntax error message right
04:52 - if you are using python 2.x version you
04:55 - can write down print something like this
04:56 - so let's just do practical of this thing
04:59 - so we have opened our pycharm ide and
05:02 - let me just first
05:04 - change the color
05:06 - so you can go to file if you want to
05:08 - change if you are comfortable with this
05:11 - color you can go for this but i am not
05:13 - comfortable so go to setting
05:15 - and appearance in appearance just theme
05:18 - and
05:19 - i want
05:20 - either this this light
05:22 - or
05:23 - window 10 lite this one
05:26 - so you can go for any one
05:28 - from here you can set these themes okay
05:32 - so now let's change this color and
05:35 - just click ok now i guess you can see it
05:38 - clearly the code fine
05:40 - now
05:41 - we have created our first project in the
05:43 - previous video and first file first dot
05:46 - py okay
05:47 - if you want to create another file what
05:49 - you have to do in the first project on
05:51 - first project just click right click new
05:54 - and file and just name your file
05:57 - okay
05:58 - so i'm not going to create
06:01 - in the first dot py only extension is
06:03 - dot py
06:04 - we are printing so
06:06 - okay
06:07 - how to print just use the sprint
06:09 - function print
06:12 - fine let me just write down again p r i
06:14 - n t print and see it is showing you
06:18 - this is the you know beauty of this ide
06:21 - auto completion and see the print syntax
06:24 - it is showing here you can write down
06:25 - this values sap and file flash whatever
06:28 - these things that also one by one will
06:30 - be discussing but right now just if i
06:33 - just click enter
06:35 - it will give me like these parentheses
06:38 - automatically so now within these
06:40 - parentheses
06:42 - i'm adding
06:44 - hello
06:46 - world
06:48 - okay
06:49 - now let me just run this for you first
06:52 - see from here i have to select here main
06:55 - file is selected so i am going to select
06:57 - current file
06:59 - so current file is first dot py
07:01 - current file means i am working in this
07:03 - file and let's just or you can click in
07:06 - this
07:07 - this is the run button or you can just
07:09 - right click and
07:11 - this run first
07:13 - click on this
07:14 - okay now here
07:16 - it is going to run now and now it will
07:18 - print on your screen hello world first
07:21 - time you know it is taking some time
07:23 - because of the indexing and all
07:25 - so see you can see here hello world
07:28 - fine if i miss this semi-colon this
07:33 - sorry this um
07:35 - double quote closing double quote
07:38 - as you can see a red red underline
07:41 - means there is something
07:43 - wrong there is an error okay so this is
07:46 - what you can say uh
07:49 - this id will give you these kind of
07:51 - things if you use id this is you can see
07:53 - some features or
07:55 - some advantages of using id c missing
07:58 - closing codes
08:00 - so from here only you will come to know
08:02 - yeah you have missed quotes
08:04 - or if you run this
08:05 - here also you will get c now type of
08:07 - error c syntax error syntax error it is
08:11 - a syntax error
08:12 - so types of errors there are many types
08:14 - of error
08:15 - okay that also ah with these parallely
08:18 - with the code we will be seeing
08:21 - this is what syntax error syntax means
08:23 - what there are some rules to write
08:26 - programs in any you know programming
08:29 - language and those rules are known as
08:31 - syntax if you don't follow the syntax
08:34 - then
08:36 - it will give syntax error
08:38 - so now syntax or you can say like we
08:40 - have grammar rules
08:42 - okay
08:43 - same in programming language also we
08:45 - have some rules to write down these
08:47 - programs so these are syntax known as
08:49 - syntax
08:50 - if now it is syntax error because syntax
08:53 - is what in print
08:55 - whatever string the message which is not
08:58 - a code actually
08:59 - see print is a code it will do something
09:01 - it will tell the interpreter to do
09:03 - something but this hello world is
09:06 - rather than hello world i can write
09:07 - jenny's lectures i can write
09:09 - anything else like you are the best
09:12 - so this is just a message it's not a
09:14 - code
09:16 - so other than the code whatever you
09:18 - write the message or the string that we
09:19 - will put in
09:21 - quotes
09:22 - okay single quotes as well as double
09:24 - quotes that also will discuss when to
09:26 - put single code when to put double quote
09:28 - okay now right now i'm putting double
09:30 - quote because actually i am from c and c
09:32 - plus background so
09:34 - to write down string i used to put the
09:36 - string the sequence of character as a
09:38 - string in double quotes
09:40 - okay
09:41 - so now see syntax error it will give
09:43 - syntax error unterminated string literal
09:46 - hello world this is a string literal it
09:48 - is unterminated you haven't terminated
09:50 - this thing detected at line number one
09:53 - line number one
09:55 - this is also a skill to identify what is
09:58 - the error type of error in which line at
10:01 - all
10:02 - okay
10:03 - so you have to you know learn this thing
10:05 - also parallel
10:08 - okay now see you can see one arrow here
10:10 - you have
10:11 - started this string literal but you
10:13 - haven't terminated here in line number
10:15 - one
10:16 - or if you are not getting what is the
10:18 - error just simply
10:20 - the error then text error this thing
10:22 - copy this thing
10:24 - open your google
10:25 - paste that
10:26 - and just click enter
10:28 - okay or more specifically you can write
10:31 - this error in python in whatever
10:32 - programming language you are
10:34 - you know practicing you're learning
10:38 - so generally first you know that link
10:40 - would be from stack overflow so there
10:42 - someone has already asked this type of
10:43 - questions and you will get many answers
10:45 - simple okay so now let's just first what
10:50 - you have to do
10:51 - close this now see after closing
10:54 - this is what
10:56 - syntax highlighting also you need to
10:57 - know the sprint is what in black the
11:00 - string is what in
11:01 - green
11:03 - this hello world plus these codes in
11:05 - green color okay and if you miss this
11:08 - and these
11:09 - ah what you can say
11:12 - so the sprint is what in not in black
11:15 - it's in blue and these parentheses are
11:18 - in black so if you remove this double
11:21 - quote from here this parenthesis and the
11:23 - ending of the parentheses parenthesis
11:24 - this is also in green color so there is
11:26 - something wrong you can identify
11:28 - okay
11:30 - okay now put this one and just
11:33 - run this again so it will print now
11:35 - hello world whatever you want to print
11:36 - you can print now if you don't put this
11:39 - parenthesis
11:41 - will give an error see you can see the
11:43 - red underline here again
11:45 - okay let me just run this
11:47 - and it will give again some error see it
11:50 - is giving syntax error missing
11:52 - parenthesis in call to print
11:55 - did you mean this print you are calling
11:58 - print calling means print is a function
11:59 - so we are calling print but missing
12:01 - parenthesis missing parenthesis
12:03 - because we are using three point
12:04 - exposures and so
12:06 - here you have to put
12:08 - these parentheses
12:09 - okay
12:11 - now
12:12 - okay what you need to do blank print you
12:15 - can call
12:16 - see
12:17 - blank print also you can call it will
12:20 - not print nothing but a blank line it
12:22 - will call an individual new line
12:25 - character so again if i write print
12:29 - and call
12:31 - you will see two blank new line same
12:33 - three four five print plan you will call
12:36 - these blank line would be increased like
12:38 - this i hope now print is clear to you
12:41 - now in next video i'll
12:43 - discuss a coding exercise with you guys
12:46 - okay
12:47 - so i hope every point about print
12:48 - function is clear to you guys how to
12:50 - write down your first program how to
12:52 - print something on console in python now
12:54 - in the next video we will see a coding
12:56 - exercise related to this print function
12:58 - right so i'll see you in the next video
13:00 - till then bye take
