00:00 - so in this video I'm going to discuss
00:02 - how I cleared gate exam what was my
00:04 - preparation strategy to crack gate exam
00:07 - because I'm getting many messages on my
00:10 - Instagram account that mum please make a
00:14 - video on some tips how to prepare for
00:16 - gate exam as well as have you cleared
00:19 - your gate exam what was your preparation
00:21 - strategy means how much hours you use to
00:24 - study at that time and everything so
00:27 - first of all in this video I will
00:28 - discuss my preparation strategy and in
00:30 - next video I will discuss how to prepare
00:33 - for gate exam some simple tips and
00:35 - tricks you should go for watching or not
00:37 - and how many hours you should study in a
00:39 - day or how many months it required to
00:43 - crack gate exam it is possible to Craig
00:45 - Craig gate exam in first attempt or not
00:47 - and you know everything every type of
00:49 - questions that we'll discuss in next
00:51 - video so actually my score in gate exam
00:54 - was around 94th percentile right so I
00:58 - can't say it's very good or we can't say
01:00 - it's bad average score was there right
01:04 - till my final year I haven't decided
01:07 - that I want to go for gate exam right so
01:11 - generally students to what in third year
01:14 - only they decided that they want to go
01:15 - for two gate exam and they start
01:17 - preparing for gate exam but I haven't
01:18 - decided
01:19 - till my final year so around September
01:23 - in final year and Athene around
01:25 - September mid September I decided that I
01:27 - want to go for gate exam so at that time
01:30 - I was having only four months Ashley
01:32 - October November December January
01:34 - because it I think on 8th or fab my gate
01:37 - exam was there so I was not having much
01:41 - time so that is why I did what I went
01:45 - for coaching but weekend coaching on
01:49 - Saturdays Sundays only my class timing
01:52 - was 8 o clock in the morning from 8 o
01:54 - clock in the morning to 5:00
01:55 - or somewhere around 6 o clock in the
01:58 - evening so now you can calculate I was
02:01 - having only 4 months so how many classes
02:04 - I have attended around 30 classes 28 or
02:06 - 30 classes I ever attended and till 15th
02:09 - of January because obviously you need
02:11 - some time
02:13 - to revise those subject it's not like
02:15 - that paneer so fab you have your gait
02:17 - examined till six or seven you are
02:19 - completing your slippers
02:21 - you are not revising the concepts no
02:23 - that is the biggest mistake if you do so
02:27 - hey I don't want to say that you must go
02:29 - for watching to graduate exam my reason
02:31 - was different because I was not well
02:33 - prepared for the gate exam I was having
02:36 - only four months and obviously to
02:39 - prepare for any gate exam or any use in
02:41 - that exam I have already discussed in my
02:42 - previous video also that in that we do
02:44 - have discussed how to prepare for you
02:46 - the CNET exam obviously you need
02:48 - material some good material organized in
02:51 - an organized way you have to analyze the
02:53 - previously previous your question paper
02:55 - which type of questions are being asked
02:57 - and the weight is of each subject you
03:00 - have to identify in which subject you
03:01 - are strong you have to devote much time
03:04 - to which subject obviously you have to
03:07 - plan everything but and I was not having
03:09 - much time to do this thing and seriously
03:11 - I was not you know at that time you can
03:15 - say I was not a self-motivated kind of
03:17 - person that I can do this thing that is
03:20 - why I decided to go for coaching but
03:22 - weekend coaching on Saturday Sunday is
03:24 - only so my motto to go for coaching go
03:28 - just to have that material you should go
03:32 - for if you want to go for coaching you
03:33 - should go for a good coaching or
03:34 - aptitude coaching that have some you
03:36 - know renowned history so I decided to
03:39 - join coaching to get that material and
03:41 - Moke tests as well right and obviously
03:44 - in coaching they also tell you some tips
03:46 - and tricks some short breaks and which
03:48 - type of questions are being asked and
03:50 - everything that is why I went for
03:52 - coaching but it's not like that that
03:53 - only coaching can with only coaching you
03:56 - can craft any exam coaching plus
03:58 - self-study you require i have already
04:00 - uploaded a video on coaching versus
04:02 - self-study you can just you can watch
04:04 - that video in this I button so now comes
04:07 - to slippers I haven't covered the entire
04:09 - slavers actually and that is the you
04:13 - know main point 100 mark because now the
04:18 - gate paper is of 100 marks I guess and
04:20 - 65 questions are being asked right so
04:24 - it's not like that you should aim for
04:26 - the
04:26 - hundred marks or 99 marks if you wanna
04:30 - go for IITs and IISc s then I can say
04:35 - above sixty marks are fine to get into
04:40 - those I guess for IITs above fifty five
04:44 - marks out of hundred and if you wanna
04:48 - get into ia SC in that case I think you
04:51 - need about sixty five marks or around
04:54 - seventy but I'm not much sure about this
04:57 - that thing we will discuss in next video
04:59 - I have to do some research on this thing
05:01 - but I guess these kind of marks are
05:03 - required so three sections are there in
05:06 - this exam one is your general aptitude
05:09 - next is your engineering mathematics and
05:11 - subject specific so from subject
05:15 - specification around nine subjects are
05:18 - there from those subjects I have
05:20 - prepared I was good in data structure in
05:22 - programming so I prepared those things
05:25 - computer networks database right and
05:28 - digital logic algorithms operating
05:32 - system and computer organization and
05:35 - architecture although I was not good in
05:37 - CoA but to some extent I have prepared
05:39 - that thing but I have left TOC and
05:42 - compiler design entirely because I was
05:46 - not good in those subjects and I was
05:48 - having less time so it's better if this
05:51 - is the case it's better to focus on your
05:53 - strong sections so I haven't prepared
05:55 - that time see TOC and your compiler
05:58 - design right general aptitude in this
06:01 - section they test your availability and
06:04 - numerical ability so I was good in this
06:06 - section so that was a plus point for me
06:09 - in engineering mathematics the sections
06:12 - are discrete mathematics calculus linear
06:14 - algebra and probability I was not good
06:17 - in probability so I went touched
06:18 - probability little bit I was good in
06:21 - calculus so I have tried that thing also
06:24 - but linear algebra and digital
06:27 - mathematics I was good in those subjects
06:29 - so I prepared for that one those
06:32 - sections in from this engineering maths
06:35 - so the point here is what I haven't
06:38 - prepared all the subjects I just focused
06:40 - on those subjects in which I was good I
06:42 - was strong and obviously all the
06:46 - students who are going forget examine at
06:48 - exam they should do this thing so 10
06:51 - 2015 of January around 15,000 Ameri I
06:54 - have attended the classes and then 15 to
06:58 - 20 days I devoted for revision this
07:00 - thing is very important for any exam
07:04 - preparation right and when I was
07:06 - attending the classes at that time I
07:08 - used to take my you know notes from
07:11 - those classes with different different
07:14 - kind of pen and markers I used to
07:16 - highlight important formulas or any
07:19 - tricks or anything which I think that
07:22 - it's important or which the faculty used
07:25 - to tell us that this thing is important
07:27 - forget exam so I used to mark that thing
07:30 - or I used to write down that thing in
07:32 - this kind of box so at the time of
07:34 - revision these kind of things will help
07:36 - you so in 15 to 20 days I revised the
07:39 - subjects and at that time also for those
07:44 - important points I have prepared
07:46 - separate notes right like I have taken
07:50 - one subject that is I'm really I'm
07:52 - revising computer networks so from my
07:55 - notes that I used to prepare in my class
07:57 - at the time of coaching from that notes
08:00 - I have prepared
08:01 - small notes they use they were having
08:06 - only that important formula as some
08:08 - tricks or some important points that can
08:11 - only like this from all the subjects I
08:14 - did this for all the subject like
08:16 - computer networks and DBMS and operating
08:17 - system and everything so that sometimes
08:20 - what we do when we go for the exam on
08:23 - that day also we used to study the
08:26 - things before getting in entry into the
08:29 - examination hole till that point so at
08:32 - that time you can use your these kind of
08:34 - notes
08:35 - small notes just to you know revise the
08:38 - important things the important formulas
08:40 - or the short tricks and these kind of
08:42 - things so this is going to help you
08:44 - definitely if you do this thing and on
08:47 - weekdays generally I used to study to be
08:49 - very honest
08:50 - three to four
08:52 - sorry but say this time depends on
08:55 - student to student I was good in my
08:59 - academics that is why my basics and my
09:03 - concepts was clear so I used to study
09:05 - only through to for us
09:06 - maybe someone are not good so strong in
09:11 - basics and someone is not so good in
09:13 - academics so you have to spend five to
09:15 - six hours so seven to eight hours in a
09:18 - day so it depends on you you have to
09:20 - analyze your capability you have to and
09:23 - analyze yourself so in brief my strategy
09:26 - was just four months weekend coaching's
09:31 - three to four hours a day forgetting
09:34 - them and I got around 94% I ring gate so
09:38 - next video we are going to discuss how
09:39 - to prepare for gate exam you generally
09:41 - have to prepare for gate exam some tips
09:43 - and tricks you should follow if you are
09:45 - going for the gate exam right so now I'm
09:47 - going to see you in the next video till
09:49 - then bye bye take care
