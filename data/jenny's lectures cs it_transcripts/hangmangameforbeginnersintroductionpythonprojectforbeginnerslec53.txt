00:00 - so in the series of planning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen what is indentation
00:05 - in Python why this is so important in
00:06 - Python right
00:08 - so now on this video we'll be working on
00:10 - a project Hangman game it's uh you can
00:13 - say mini project for beginners right we
00:16 - are going to create a game hangman theme
00:18 - I hope you have heard about this game or
00:19 - you have played this game you know the
00:20 - rules and all if you don't know it's
00:22 - okay in this video I'll give you just
00:24 - you know a brief intro about this game
00:26 - and with the help of example I'll show
00:28 - you what kind of output should be there
00:30 - how to play this game right so basically
00:32 - this game is a guessing game for two
00:34 - players or more than two players suppose
00:36 - I am having like two player first and
00:41 - second first player and second player so
00:44 - first player will guess a word any word
00:47 - can be there fruits food any vegetable
00:49 - name you know animal Name birds name any
00:52 - name can be there
00:53 - right suppose I have a guest apple right
00:58 - I'll not tell the second player I have
00:59 - guessed Apple
01:01 - fine so like whenever you you will run
01:04 - this
01:05 - so I have guessed like apple so one two
01:08 - three four five one two three four five
01:10 - letters are there only these five blank
01:13 - spaces are shown to the second player
01:16 - not this word right so now second player
01:19 - have to guess this word by suggesting
01:22 - the letters right
01:24 - but
01:26 - within a limited number of gases it's
01:29 - not like that just there are unlimited
01:31 - number of gases and unlimited attempts
01:33 - you will get no there are limited
01:34 - attempts
01:35 - right hangman basically
01:39 - it's like
01:41 - we have a hangman this this is the head
01:45 - the body of the that figure then two
01:48 - hands and legs
01:50 - so basically we have like we consider
01:54 - that we have six lives one two three
01:57 - four five six
01:59 - right within six attempts you have to
02:01 - guess the correct word
02:03 - suppose my guess is second player have
02:05 - guessed X
02:07 - so this is
02:10 - this is not present here this letter
02:12 - means you have guessed wrong letter and
02:14 - you will lose a life loser life means
02:17 - I'll be the first player will be
02:19 - starting to draw the hangman figure so
02:21 - I'll draw first of all the head right
02:24 - suppose second guess is a now a is
02:27 - correct a is in this
02:29 - word so at correct position I'll place
02:32 - this letter A
02:35 - right so now you will not lose a life
02:38 - suppose in third guess you have guessed
02:40 - why why is not present means your guest
02:43 - wrong letter so you are going to lose a
02:45 - life
02:46 - and let's draw one more part of the
02:49 - hangman figure that is the body of this
02:51 - hangman right now next guess is suppose
02:54 - Z this is also not correct so I'll draw
02:57 - one hand next guess is suppose M this is
03:01 - also not present so I'll draw
03:04 - second hand the first player will draw
03:06 - second hand now you are having only two
03:08 - lives one for this leg one for this leg
03:11 - once the figure is complete means
03:14 - this would be hand or die
03:16 - a means you will you are going to lose
03:18 - suppose next guess is e so I'll place
03:21 - this e here next is p so I'll Place p
03:24 - and B here only one is remaining next
03:27 - case is suppose B that is not correct
03:30 - one leg next guess is C it is also not
03:33 - correct second
03:35 - game over means you lose
03:38 - because the hangman figure is complete
03:40 - means it's hanged
03:43 - means you let a kind person die right or
03:47 - maybe you're still having one life and
03:49 - your guest correct l l means you are
03:53 - going to win
03:55 - the this
03:57 - letter is complete the word is complete
03:59 - means game over so two conditions for
04:02 - game over if the word is complete there
04:05 - is no Blank Space here in the word then
04:09 - game over you are going to win the
04:10 - message would be displayed you are going
04:12 - to win second game second condition to
04:15 - you know for for this uh for game over
04:18 - is what you are out of your lives
04:20 - right you have consumed all your attempt
04:23 - six attempts right means that's it game
04:26 - or you are going to at this point of
04:28 - time message would be printed you are
04:29 - going to you lose
04:31 - so this is what a Hangman game
04:34 - right I hope you got this now how to
04:36 - play this game right let me just show
04:38 - you the output how you know output
04:40 - should look like
04:42 - right okay so this kind of output would
04:46 - be there if you whenever you will run
04:48 - this project like maybe first line let's
04:51 - play Hangman and
04:53 - we have only six lives so it will show
04:55 - you you have only six lives to try to
04:57 - guess the word within six attempts good
04:59 - luck right now
05:01 - it has already guessed a word we don't
05:03 - know what is what the word is but the
05:06 - word is having one two three four five
05:08 - five
05:09 - letters and it will show only blank
05:12 - spaces so guess a letter suppose I am
05:14 - guessing
05:15 - X
05:18 - so X is not there so it will show you
05:20 - guessed X that is not present in the
05:22 - word so you lose a life loser life means
05:25 - now see the head
05:27 - head this
05:29 - of that hangman figure would be
05:31 - added to this figure right
05:36 - now again yes a letter suppose a
05:39 - okay a is present so
05:42 - at the position at first it will
05:45 - put a here now I guess you have guessed
05:48 - this letter
05:49 - so now it will again Ask guess a letter
05:51 - so I'm suppose B
05:54 - c b is not present so it will again draw
05:57 - the body of the handmade right you
06:00 - U is also not present it will show one
06:04 - hand of the hangman will be drawn next
06:07 - is let's say something like this oh that
06:09 - is also not present m not present so we
06:13 - are remaining only with one life only
06:15 - because One lag is remaining if this leg
06:17 - is complete hangman field is complete
06:19 - and you are going to lose so if I can
06:22 - guess the letter is p
06:24 - so p is present p and p
06:27 - okay I know what is this n okay l
06:32 - and then e d
06:35 - e so it's Apple you win means you have
06:39 - guessed this letter before the segment
06:42 - figure is complete right so now you you
06:46 - are going to win
06:47 - right
06:49 - if if I run this again
06:51 - see
06:52 - it is
06:54 - next suppose X this is not present l
06:58 - not present G not present e not present
07:03 - U
07:09 - right so we are left with only one life
07:12 - so let me just guess
07:15 - D not present so hangman figure is
07:19 - complete and
07:20 - you lose right
07:26 - so now you have the idea what is Hangman
07:28 - game and how to play this the rules and
07:29 - all right now the second
07:32 - part of this this thing is what this
07:35 - project is what you have to create a
07:37 - flowchart first because we have a
07:40 - complex problem how to
07:42 - no uh the wireless complex problem into
07:44 - smaller tasks smaller ones so just draw
07:47 - flowchart you can write down algorithm
07:49 - and draw flowchart
07:50 - to better and you know understand this
07:53 - problem try to draw flowchart first then
07:56 - write start writing program right so in
07:59 - the next video we will be drawing the
08:00 - flowchart so now we see the next little
08:02 - demo bye take care
