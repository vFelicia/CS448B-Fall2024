00:00 - if you are thinking i am going to tell
00:01 - you any shortcut to learn a programming
00:03 - language then this video is definitely
00:05 - for you i am not going to tell you any
00:07 - shortcut because there is no shortcut to
00:09 - learn a programming language
00:11 - what i am going to tell you in this
00:12 - video is the right path to learn a
00:14 - programming language
00:15 - best way to learn a programming language
00:18 - what students do
00:19 - how they learn a programming language
00:21 - maybe it's because of your
00:22 - you know college environment and that's
00:25 - the way they teach you
00:26 - like in first semester you have c so you
00:29 - started learning
00:30 - c language like first you learn some
00:32 - syntaxes then
00:33 - uh that hello world program then some
00:36 - addition program subtraction program
00:39 - program to check whether a number is
00:40 - prime or not whether number is even or
00:42 - owed
00:42 - to find out factorial to find out
00:44 - february series and some advanced level
00:45 - program
00:46 - right that is how we exactly learn
00:48 - programming language
00:49 - and then just your semester comes and
00:52 - and most of the students do some
00:54 - ratification also i think
00:56 - they want to memorize those syntax they
00:58 - want to memorize those programs
01:00 - just to pass the semester so just to
01:02 - pass your lab practicals and that's over
01:04 - in next next semester you have c plus
01:06 - but
01:08 - see if you have written sometimes many
01:11 - students think if you have written a
01:12 - program hello world program you have
01:14 - just printed hello world and what you
01:16 - think
01:16 - i am a programmer no you are not dear
01:19 - right now you don't even know p of
01:22 - programming and if you follow this path
01:24 - like this i have discussed that is going
01:26 - to be followed in your
01:27 - college to learn a programming language
01:29 - at last what you will say i'm not good
01:32 - in implementing logic i'm not able to
01:33 - think logic
01:35 - i'm not in i'm not good in any
01:37 - programming language
01:38 - and ultimately what you will think it's
01:39 - very tough i cannot learn any
01:41 - programming language
01:42 - but the mistake is what the path you
01:45 - follow to learn a programming language
01:47 - it's not your mistake
01:48 - you are right person it's not like that
01:50 - your brain is
01:51 - of not of that type or you are a weak
01:53 - student you are dumb no the path you are
01:55 - following to learn a programming
01:57 - language
01:58 - that is wrong so that's exactly i'm
02:00 - going to discuss in this video the right
02:02 - path to learn a programming language
02:05 - right
02:05 - before that just want to tell you one
02:07 - thing if you are interested in
02:09 - competitive programming then an academy
02:10 - in collaboration with code chef has
02:12 - started a course to learn competitive
02:14 - programming
02:15 - there you can take free live classes and
02:18 - if you are not able to take live classes
02:19 - it's okay you can attend
02:21 - their recorded sessions also the top
02:23 - educators are going to teach you
02:25 - those are toppers of acm icpc finalist
02:28 - of icbc and working in top giant
02:30 - companies like google flipkart
02:31 - amazon right and if you like their free
02:34 - classes then you can go for their paid
02:36 - subscription
02:37 - and if you will go for their paid
02:38 - subscription after that you will get a
02:40 - proper structured course interactive
02:42 - session would be there with these top
02:43 - educators and one more thing they have
02:45 - categorized these classes
02:47 - into three levels like for beginners for
02:49 - intermediate level and for advanced
02:50 - level so obviously you know yourself at
02:52 - what level you are in competitive
02:54 - programming so according to that you can
02:56 - watch that playlist
02:57 - and these are free classes so i'll give
02:58 - you the link of these free classes of
03:00 - all the levels in the description box of
03:02 - this video you can go and check out
03:04 - and a test is also there like um it's
03:06 - called a programming aptitude test
03:07 - to test your programming skills it is of
03:10 - uh
03:11 - 25 minutes and 10 mcqs would be there in
03:13 - this test
03:14 - there is no validity of this test you
03:15 - can take any time and they are also
03:17 - conducting a scholarship test
03:19 - named code chef programming scholarship
03:21 - test that is on 12th of december and you
03:23 - can freely take this
03:25 - test you just have to enroll then you
03:27 - can attempt the test
03:28 - live and the top 10 rankers would get a
03:31 - chance to get
03:33 - a free subscription for one month so you
03:36 - can pick the right test for you the
03:37 - detail is over here
03:39 - so if you are interested you can go for
03:41 - these tests
03:42 - all the links whatever i have discussed
03:44 - here the links for those
03:46 - things i will give you and all the
03:47 - details i'll provide you in the
03:48 - description box of this video you can go
03:50 - and check out
03:51 - so now let us discuss what is the right
03:53 - path what is the best way to learn a
03:55 - programming language
03:56 - see first point is very clear you have
03:59 - to be good at fundamentals so just pick
04:01 - one language
04:02 - in which you are interested to see c
04:03 - plus plus java python any language
04:06 - pick one clear your fundamentals your
04:08 - fundamentals your basic should be very
04:10 - strong because if your basics are
04:12 - strong then it is you know very easy for
04:14 - you to grab the advanced
04:16 - concepts and if your basics are not so
04:19 - strong
04:19 - and if you directly jump to the advanced
04:22 - topics advanced concepts and definitely
04:24 - you will stuck
04:25 - somewhere so first of all work on your
04:27 - basics
04:28 - right that is very true what you have to
04:31 - do next thing after
04:32 - clearing your fundamentals now what you
04:34 - have to do and see if you are learning a
04:36 - language by yourself which are
04:38 - not depending on whatever they teach in
04:39 - colleges so hardly it will take 5
04:42 - or 10 days maximum 10 days to learn
04:44 - fundamentals to be good
04:45 - in fundamentals after that it's not like
04:48 - that you have to complete the proper
04:50 - course of that c language or any
04:52 - language you are
04:53 - choosing right now what you have to do
04:56 - is
04:56 - second thing what you have to do it's
04:58 - project based
04:59 - learning you have to do now it's time to
05:02 - pick a project now it's time to work a
05:05 - project to work on a project
05:06 - right maybe it's if you are interested
05:08 - in any website development or
05:11 - any windows application or any app
05:13 - development mobile app development ios
05:15 - development take that project simple
05:18 - project
05:19 - starting in starting take simple project
05:21 - and start working on that project right
05:24 - because see whenever you are writing a
05:26 - program like in
05:27 - in first semester you have c language or
05:29 - in uh second semester you have c
05:31 - language
05:31 - you are writing that programs everything
05:33 - like to print hello world edition
05:36 - and uh to find out for beniki series and
05:38 - everything you are writing
05:39 - it's okay but now you know do you know
05:42 - the
05:42 - you know true meaning of writing those
05:44 - programs or you are just writing
05:46 - programs you are just learning that
05:48 - language to pass semester exams to pass
05:50 - your
05:51 - lab practicals that's it i'm damn sure
05:53 - this question would have arised in mind
05:55 - of many students when they are learning
05:57 - any programming language when they were
05:58 - writing code
06:00 - like why i am writing this code what is
06:03 - that
06:04 - that true meaning of learning this
06:05 - programming language what is the meaning
06:07 - of writing this for loop
06:09 - where i will use this for loop or while
06:11 - loop or all the you know syntax or
06:13 - everything i am learning here
06:14 - so see i am going to tell you if you are
06:17 - playing a video game behind
06:18 - that screen is also how you are able to
06:22 - play that video game behind that this is
06:23 - a software behind that there is a
06:25 - lengthy code and someone
06:27 - has written that code so i think why
06:28 - this programming language had been
06:30 - invented
06:31 - to to make something to build something
06:34 - so that
06:34 - people can use that thing to make some
06:37 - applications some softwares
06:38 - games or any apps so that people can use
06:42 - those apps those softwares and
06:44 - it is going to make real life the life
06:46 - of people easy they can use it
06:48 - so i think that should be your reason to
06:50 - learn a programming language so that
06:52 - you can build something so that you can
06:55 - build any app or any software any
06:56 - application people can use it will going
06:58 - to make
06:59 - the life of others people easy it is not
07:03 - like that you are just learning a
07:04 - language because it's in your curriculum
07:06 - and
07:06 - you have to pass semester exam you have
07:08 - to pass your practicals
07:10 - right if you think like this then you
07:12 - will
07:13 - never be so good in a pre in any
07:15 - programming language
07:16 - your aim should be to build something so
07:18 - that's exactly
07:19 - start working on a project after your
07:22 - fundamentals after clearing your
07:24 - fundamentals right
07:25 - like suppose if you are working on a
07:27 - project maybe
07:29 - here there you want to implement like
07:30 - user id and
07:32 - password and then maybe forgot
07:36 - some kind of website you are making so
07:39 - now you will you know search how you can
07:41 - make this text box
07:43 - and if in password how you can uh you
07:46 - know
07:47 - apply that validation like if someone
07:49 - enter wrong user id wrong password then
07:52 - it is
07:52 - definitely it should show that you have
07:56 - entered incorrect user id or incorrect
07:58 - password right
07:59 - so have to implement this logic then you
08:01 - will search
08:02 - you can ask help for others like many
08:05 - platforms or also they're like
08:06 - stack overflow many platforms are there
08:08 - there you can post your question you
08:10 - will definitely get
08:11 - a good answer then you will come to know
08:14 - the true meaning why you are learning
08:16 - everything that in programming language
08:18 - for loops and everything like
08:19 - any other things also like yeah this is
08:22 - how we are going to check validation
08:24 - okay this is the code that is why i'm
08:26 - using this so better to start playing
08:28 - with code as early as possible
08:30 - it's kind of active learning rather than
08:32 - basic learning
08:33 - and remember sooner you start playing
08:35 - with the code the faster you will learn
08:37 - that concept
08:38 - and this is true see let's take one more
08:40 - example that example of time complexity
08:42 - this is i think
08:43 - you know optimization of algorithm you
08:44 - have to write optimized algorithm like
08:46 - the time complexity should be in log n
08:48 - it should not be order of n square it
08:50 - should
08:50 - it should be n log n or log n that is
08:53 - good
08:54 - but what is the use of this optimization
08:56 - of algorithms what is the use of this
08:58 - time complexity space complexity
09:00 - then that time when you are working on a
09:02 - project suppose you are
09:03 - making any app at that time see suppose
09:07 - when anyone is clicking on that app or
09:08 - anything in within that app and it is
09:10 - taking
09:11 - 10 seconds to load so it is not good
09:14 - you think that how can you reduce this
09:17 - time at that time
09:18 - the actual meaning of time complexity
09:20 - the actual meaning of optimization
09:22 - of algorithm will uh you will understand
09:25 - how to optimize and why you are
09:28 - optimizing your algorithm because
09:30 - if anything is uh taking 10 seconds to
09:32 - upload
09:33 - then and some other things some other
09:35 - app is taking only one second two
09:37 - seconds and definitely
09:38 - the users will go for that app that is
09:41 - taking less time
09:42 - so you have to optimize your code also
09:45 - right
09:46 - so at that time you will come to know
09:47 - the meaning of these things
09:49 - when you are working on projects when
09:51 - you are making apps when you are making
09:52 - any applications any softwares
09:54 - so rather than searching how to learn a
09:56 - language like how to learn java java
09:58 - tutorials watching those tutorials
10:00 - just writing programs no that is not
10:02 - enough it is not right path
10:04 - start making a project if you stuck
10:06 - somewhere then search how to implement
10:08 - this thing in project how to implement
10:11 - this thing using java or any language
10:13 - then you will come to know then the
10:15 - solution will come many solutions maybe
10:16 - will come when you are searching
10:18 - and see please do not underestimate the
10:20 - power of search
10:21 - unlimited resources are there on
10:23 - internet you just have to search
10:25 - those resources you just have to utilize
10:27 - those resources
10:29 - please do not be dependent on just on
10:31 - your books and the faculties and on your
10:33 - college
10:34 - self learning this is also very
10:36 - important
10:37 - and i guess you will learn more by
10:39 - applying this technique this
10:40 - self learning techniques rather than
10:43 - depending on your
10:44 - faculties on your college and your
10:46 - textbooks right
10:47 - so start building a project while you
10:49 - are going through that study material
10:51 - you have
10:52 - because any personal project that is a
10:54 - very good starting point
10:56 - it's not like that you are waiting for
10:58 - your faculties for your you know
10:59 - curriculum
11:00 - to ask you to uh make a project like in
11:03 - third year or in final year no you have
11:05 - to start making project
11:07 - from first year from first semester only
11:09 - or as soon as you learn a programming
11:11 - language or no
11:12 - no not after learning a programming
11:14 - language while you are learning a
11:16 - programming language
11:17 - at that time only start making a project
11:20 - that's exactly you have to do
11:22 - and if you will follow this path then
11:23 - you will never have to memorize
11:25 - any syntax anything and it will be in
11:28 - your memory
11:29 - for a long time all the syntaxes and
11:31 - everything about that programming
11:32 - language
11:32 - and if you learn one programming
11:34 - language it is not so easy
11:37 - so difficult for you to learn at another
11:39 - programming language
11:40 - actually this technique i am going i'm
11:42 - telling you based on my experience
11:44 - so that's it for this video now i'll see
11:46 - in the next video till then bye bye take
11:54 - care
