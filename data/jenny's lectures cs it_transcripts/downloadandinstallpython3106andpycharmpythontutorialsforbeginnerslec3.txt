00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:02 - programming language in previous video
00:04 - we have talked about history of python
00:06 - language
00:07 - now
00:08 - in this video we will install actually
00:11 - python as well as an ide for writing
00:14 - programs in python language and then we
00:16 - write a simple program just to print
00:18 - hello world that's we usually do
00:20 - whenever we you learn any programming
00:22 - language first program you write is
00:24 - print hello world so this these three
00:26 - things we'll do in this video right
00:28 - python is a interpreted language so that
00:31 - is you can say basically we will you
00:33 - know install the base interpreter for
00:35 - python
00:36 - right so now let's see how to
00:39 - install these things one by one step by
00:42 - step
00:43 - okay
00:45 - first we will search like
00:48 - just
00:50 - write down download python
00:52 - okay
00:54 - and
00:55 - better
00:56 - to open the website
00:59 - the website of this python dot or
01:01 - python.org
01:03 - right
01:04 - and here in the download section you
01:06 - will find download python 3.10.6
01:10 - the latest version is 3.10.6 so we are
01:12 - going to download this version for
01:13 - windows
01:15 - okay so just click on download and
01:18 - that's it
01:20 - it will take only few seconds and see
01:22 - it's been downloaded let's just click on
01:26 - this
01:27 - and now
01:28 - how to install this you can click on
01:30 - install now two options are there or
01:32 - customize installation in customize you
01:34 - can choose your location and some
01:35 - features
01:36 - right by default this would be your
01:38 - location if you click on install now
01:42 - okay it will include ideally pip
01:44 - documentation and all we'll see what is
01:46 - ideally what is pip basically to install
01:48 - python packages and all you'll see one
01:50 - by one these videos but for now just add
01:52 - this uh
01:54 - just check this also this textbook
01:57 - checkbox add python
01:59 - 3.10 to path means
02:01 - automatically it will be added to path
02:03 - and directly from cmd command prompt you
02:04 - can
02:05 - run the center better you can run the
02:07 - commands on python you don't need to add
02:09 - any path right so i'll do customized
02:11 - installation okay see in this what are
02:14 - the features documentation pip it will
02:16 - install you know pip which will download
02:19 - and install python packages
02:21 - later we will install some packages also
02:23 - in python so using pip we can do that
02:25 - thing
02:26 - okay
02:27 - now
02:28 - let's let's click on
02:30 - next and install for all users right
02:34 - and you just keep everything as it is
02:38 - this is the location install location c
02:40 - program files and python 3.10 okay and
02:43 - click on install that's it and then
02:46 - yes
02:48 - now it has been started and it will take
02:51 - few seconds to install this uh language
02:54 - to this this interpreter for this
02:56 - language here we are downloading the
02:58 - base interpreter for python
03:00 - right
03:01 - now after that we will install ide
03:04 - pycharm basically id is one integrated
03:06 - development environment
03:08 - which is basically an application or you
03:10 - can see it's a software to build
03:11 - applications it is having text editor
03:14 - also code editor
03:16 - okay with there you can write down code
03:18 - uh with having some syntax like syntax
03:20 - highlighting some extra features it is
03:22 - having syntax highlighting
03:23 - autocompletion if there is an there is
03:25 - any error then underline it will show
03:28 - red underline
03:29 - under that line in which
03:31 - you are having error same as we have
03:33 - installed and we have worked right now
03:35 - also we are currently working visual
03:37 - studio code uh when we were we run c
03:40 - plus plus program so for this that id is
03:42 - an id also having compiler debugger
03:45 - right many things in simple and in one
03:48 - software we are having many things so
03:49 - that is why we use id
03:51 - rather than writing our programs in
03:53 - notepad we generally prefer ids many ids
03:56 - are there so here we use pycharm so
03:59 - after this we will install pycharm okay
04:02 - now let's just uh click on this end
04:07 - download
04:08 - pi
04:09 - cha
04:11 - okay
04:13 - it is by jetbrains
04:17 - so you see the first website only
04:18 - jetbrains.com
04:20 - right
04:21 - it is by jetbrain so just
04:23 - click on that thing and you will find
04:25 - two version here
04:27 - professional as well as community but
04:29 - better to download community version
04:31 - because it would be paid it would be
04:33 - free for it it is professional is a free
04:35 - 30 days trial only
04:37 - so we will
04:38 - download community version okay
04:41 - it has been started
04:43 - now as you can see
04:45 - our setup is also going on and we have
04:49 - so now python 3.10.6 64-bit setup is
04:53 - successful we will close this
04:55 - see as you can see also there are
04:57 - various releases previous release 3.10
05:00 - 3.9 3.8 whatever version you want to

05:13 - 3.9.6 you can download any other version
05:15 - also it's up to you
05:17 - right
05:18 - but better to download three point x
05:19 - version only know two point x because
05:21 - they have
05:22 - added the support for two point x
05:24 - version right now how to check that we
05:26 - have successfully downloaded this python
05:29 - so just
05:30 - you can just uh click on this you can uh
05:33 - open your command prompt cmd type cmd
05:36 - and this is your command prompt right
05:39 - now here i will
05:41 - write
05:42 - python
05:45 - version
05:46 - hyphen hyphen version so see it is
05:49 - showing me the version 3.10.6 yes it has
05:51 - successfully
05:53 - downloaded and installed sorry why not
05:55 - download it install this python this
05:57 - interpreter for us
05:59 - right
06:00 - so if you
06:02 - enter
06:03 - write python and enter then our this
06:06 - interpreter for us has been started here
06:09 - you can
06:10 - you can use this thing for calculate as
06:12 - a calculator or you can write down your
06:13 - commands here
06:15 - you can do programming also here line by
06:17 - line
06:18 - so see if i write 3 plus 2 it will show
06:21 - me 5
06:23 - so this can also be used as a calculator
06:25 - so line by line because interpreter
06:28 - would do what integrate line by line not
06:29 - the complete code so only one line you
06:32 - will write and it will show you the
06:33 - result of that line so simply we will
06:35 - exit
06:36 - from here simply type exit and
06:39 - press enter
06:40 - and one more thing we have also included
06:42 - we have also installed pip that was used
06:44 - to install some packages and all if you
06:46 - want to check that thing also you can
06:48 - just
06:49 - write down pip here and just
06:52 - enter so see it will show you something
06:55 - like this the result
06:57 - after
06:58 - uh clicking
06:59 - after writing pip and clicking just
07:01 - enter
07:02 - so this would be the case so means uh
07:04 - tip has also been installed successfully
07:06 - you don't need to do anything loud now
07:08 - they just close it
07:10 - now we will install our python the ide

08:27 - now what you need to do obviously the
08:29 - first time so we will create a new
08:31 - project so click on new project

08:56 - new environment it is showing that
08:58 - virtual environment but we don't need to
09:00 - this we don't need to do this thing
09:03 - we need to do what
09:05 - previously configured
09:07 - interpreter
09:09 - for this it was
09:11 - so now it is showing no interpreter you
09:13 - have to add interpreter because we have
09:15 - already installed python interpreter
09:17 - right so add add local interpreter and
09:22 - i have which interpreter it's python
09:25 - 3.xc location c user and base
09:28 - interpreter is program files python 3.10
09:31 - 3010 and python dot exe right this is my
09:34 - interpreter okay
09:37 - now
09:38 - just click on this so if you are you
09:40 - know if in your laptop it is not showing
09:43 - anything so you can just click on these
09:45 - three dots and you can search
09:48 - you can search in which folder you have
09:50 - installed in c folder in user or python
09:52 - in which folder you have installed that
09:54 - python previously we have installed that
09:56 - python you just go to that folder click
09:59 - go to that folder and click on python
10:00 - dot exe and then select it
10:02 - right
10:04 - in my uh pc i have already this thing
10:06 - python.exe so just click on ok
10:10 - so it is creating
10:11 - uh that environment
10:13 - so see the interpreter is python 3.x
10:16 - sorry 3.10 okay now see create a main
10:19 - dot py welcome script it will create a
10:22 - main dot py the extension for python uh
10:25 - program says dot p i just say for c we
10:27 - have dot c for c plus plus we have dot
10:29 - cpp so same for python we have a dot py
10:31 - so it will create
10:32 - a welcome script for s for us right if
10:34 - you check this if you uncheck this it
10:36 - will not create anything but i'm going
10:37 - to check this
10:38 - okay now let's just create so it is
10:41 - loading our first project c main dot p
10:44 - y so it is a sample python script
10:48 - okay
10:49 - you can say this
10:51 - if you want to check out this thing you
10:53 - can check out otherwise
10:55 - no it's okay you can
10:57 - what you can do
10:59 - you can just
11:00 - remove all these things and we can do
11:03 - our simple like we have now installed
11:06 - our ide so if you want to print hello
11:08 - world in python how you will print it's
11:11 - very simple no need to write down any
11:13 - header file main function and all
11:15 - one line you need to write down okay now
11:18 - if you want to write down that thing in
11:20 - main dot py you can do that thing or
11:22 - otherwise in first project
11:24 - you can
11:25 - you can create you can create a new file
11:28 - right click on first project new the
11:30 - name of our project is first project new
11:32 - and then
11:33 - file i'm creating new file that is
11:37 - first
11:38 - dot
11:39 - py
11:41 - here i'll write my code simply you need
11:44 - to write
11:45 - print
11:47 - and
11:51 - hello world
11:53 - that's it no semicolon nothing else
11:55 - nothing else so you can simply
11:58 - run this
11:59 - here we have a
12:01 - you know this kind of thing
12:03 - hi pycharm so it is
12:08 - okay it is actually running this main
12:10 - dot p y this file main dot p y right we
12:13 - no need to run this file we we need to
12:15 - write we need to run our first dot py
12:18 - this file so now let's uh close that
12:21 - file select this first dot py and sorry
12:25 - here here not main
12:27 - you have to select your current file
12:30 - okay
12:31 - note main here if there is this kind of
12:34 - thing you just select
12:35 - current file and run this
12:38 - now current file is first dot py so it
12:41 - is printing hello world on my screen
12:43 - simple program so i think
12:46 - with this only you can
12:48 - identify how much
12:50 - simpler
12:52 - is to code in this programming language
12:54 - python programming language then c and c
12:57 - plus plus and java and all
12:59 - to print a simple line hello world you
13:01 - just need to write down print and that
13:03 - thing
13:04 - because it is a string or the string you
13:06 - can write down in single quote also here
13:07 - no double quote but actually i am from
13:09 - that c and c plus background so
13:11 - i
13:12 - put string in double quotes and a single
13:14 - character in single code but in python
13:16 - you can write down rather than these
13:18 - double quotes single quotes as well
13:22 - uh
13:22 - single quotes
13:24 - okay let's run this current file and it
13:26 - will print hello world both are same
13:28 - single code or double quote it's up to
13:30 - you
13:31 - so i guess this is clear to you now from
13:33 - the next video we are going to start you
13:35 - know our actual python programming
13:37 - course we will learn about variables
13:39 - how to use those data types string and
13:42 - all
13:42 - you'll see these kind of things so now
13:44 - in the next video till then bye bye take
13:46 - care and if you are finding any
13:47 - difficulty in downloading and installing
13:49 - these kind of things you can let me know
13:50 - in comment section
13:52 - okay
13:53 - so let's see the next video now till
13:55 - then bye take
