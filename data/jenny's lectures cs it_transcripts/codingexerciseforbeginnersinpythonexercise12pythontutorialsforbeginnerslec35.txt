00:00 - so in a series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:02 - video we have seen randomization random
00:04 - module their function and based on that
00:06 - we have done one coding exercise heads
00:08 - or tails means you have written a
00:10 - virtual coin dose programming right it
00:12 - will generate a random number either 0
00:14 - or 1 and based on that you will tell it
00:15 - it's heads or things that was simple one
00:17 - but in this video we'll discuss one more
00:20 - coding exercise that is little bit
00:21 - complicated but if you have you know
00:24 - idea of that randomization all the
00:26 - random functions and all properly then
00:28 - you can easily you can easily solve this
00:30 - uh problem right now what is this
00:32 - problem statement
00:34 - see suppose four or five five friends
00:38 - are sitting in a restaurant
00:40 - now who will pay the bill so for that
00:42 - for that they'll use a technique what is
00:45 - that technique everybody will give their
00:48 - credit card or debit card or business
00:49 - card
00:50 - in a bowl or maybe in someone's hand
00:53 - right
00:55 - and the waiter or anybody from you guys
00:58 - will pick one card without seeing the
01:01 - cards right we'll pick one card
01:03 - and
01:05 - that person is going to pay the bill the
01:07 - person selected
01:09 - will pay the bill for everybody's you
01:12 - know food right that is one technique I
01:16 - have seen this thing in uh one of the
01:18 - Instagram reel also
01:20 - so this idea we are going to implement
01:23 - right so that is the thing but the idea
01:27 - is now
01:29 - how you will take input from the user
01:31 - using input function
01:32 - you will take names
01:34 - what I want is this kind of output let
01:37 - me just show you so the output should be
01:40 - something like this it will ask like
01:42 - enter everybody's name separated by
01:44 - command suppose I am entering like Jenny
01:46 - comma
01:47 - supposedly
01:50 - [Music]
01:55 - so let me just enter and it's print any
01:58 - name like it between any name like grtr
02:01 - will pay the bill something like this
02:03 - right or rather than this directly
02:06 - printing this what we can do
02:11 - like this we will enter the name then it
02:13 - will print the list so it will separate
02:15 - these into
02:18 - with different different items and it
02:20 - will create a list something like this
02:21 - and then it will pick anyone from this
02:23 - list like this time Gia will pay the
02:25 - bill so this type of account I want so I
02:28 - hope you got what kind of output we want
02:30 - so what hint let me just give you some
02:32 - in first of all there are multiple ways
02:35 - so we'll discuss two ways here you can
02:37 - use this Choice method
02:40 - from a list it will pick a random item
02:43 - so maybe you have a list of names just
02:45 - use this Choice method and it will pick
02:46 - a name and that's it it will be two line
02:49 - of code but this is very simple we will
02:51 - not use this Choice method without
02:53 - Choice method you have to write down
02:55 - this program
02:57 - right without Choice maybe you can use
03:00 - Rand enter and range or random function
03:02 - any function
03:03 - right
03:04 - now see when whenever you will enter we
03:07 - will enter using input function
03:10 - uh you know names multiple names
03:13 - so there is one function let me just
03:14 - give you one hint split
03:19 - what does function perform this suppose
03:22 - I have this text suppose I have this
03:24 - text so welcome to Jenny's lectures I
03:27 - want to split this complete string this
03:29 - is complete string and I want to split
03:31 - this and make a list right so how to use
03:36 - this method this the name of this
03:39 - complete string text Dot
03:41 - split and in bracket you will just
03:45 - provide the operator or the thing at
03:47 - which you want to split this string
03:49 - suppose I want to split this
03:53 - whenever a space it's just a space
03:55 - whenever space will find this you know
03:58 - the split function will split this
04:00 - string and after that it will store this
04:02 - into a you can say a text underscore
04:07 - splitted
04:09 - this variable and I'll just print
04:11 - this text underscore
04:15 - split it
04:16 - so what output you will get
04:19 - split function will split based on this
04:20 - operator space so output would be a list
04:24 - welcome okay space so
04:27 - welcome then it will split then T O2
04:31 - then against
04:33 - space split
04:35 - then
04:37 - something like this now these are
04:39 - individual items in this list this is a
04:42 - list and these will come as an item to
04:44 - Jenny's lectures these are individual
04:46 - items and you can access these items now
04:48 - with help of index so this is at zero
04:52 - index then one then two then three
04:55 - how to access that I guess you know just
04:58 - name of this list
05:00 - support name of this list is text
05:02 - splitted in this square brackets just
05:05 - put the index like 0 then it will print
05:07 - welcome
05:08 - so this is one hint you have to use
05:10 - split right
05:12 - and another hint I have just told you in
05:14 - this only using this index you can
05:16 - access this so maybe you can generate
05:19 - rather than this you can obviously we
05:21 - know we can generate any random integer
05:23 - number 0 1 2 3 in a Range
05:26 - we have a function random so you can use
05:28 - that thing you can
05:30 - generate any random number and based on
05:32 - that random number you can map this
05:34 - random number to this like two and like
05:38 - at this place we have Jenny the name
05:40 - Jenny
05:41 - then simply you can print Jenny will pay
05:43 - the bill
05:44 - this kind of thing right so pause the
05:46 - video and try this out
05:48 - so I hope you have done this exercise
05:49 - see this is how split function will work
05:52 - suppose in text we are welcome to
05:53 - Jenny's lectures and
05:55 - text Dot split but the operator I want
05:58 - to use is e
06:00 - or the alphabet I want to use is e
06:03 - whenever e it will find it will split
06:06 - that string from that point right now
06:10 - let me show you the output see this
06:11 - would be the output because after w we
06:14 - have e so w would be different item then
06:17 - lcom this would be different item
06:20 - because again we have e right then 2
06:24 - then after J we have e so t o space j
06:28 - would be one item and it would be
06:30 - splitted from here then n n y l like
06:33 - this I hope you got this this how split
06:35 - function will work right now let's
06:37 - create a new file and this would be what
06:40 - coding exercise
06:42 - 12.
06:49 - so obviously we will do what
06:51 - randomization so first of all we will
06:53 - import random module right now
06:57 - suppose we are taking what names using
07:01 - input function obviously we'll take
07:03 - okay so I am asking like enter
07:06 - everybody's name separated by comma
07:08 - right because I want to use comma as a
07:12 - split operator right
07:15 - so just I want to split this names Dot
07:19 - split
07:20 - function and then in bracket
07:23 - comma this operator whenever
07:26 - the split function will find this
07:28 - operator it will split the string from
07:30 - there and make a list so we will store
07:33 - this obviously in a list so suppose
07:36 - names underscore list
07:39 - this is the variable I am taking
07:41 - right
07:43 - if you want to check out you can just
07:45 - print like it's working or not rather
07:47 - than writing the complete code at first
07:49 - so I'm just printing like names list
07:53 - right let's run this
07:57 - okay this is current good
08:00 - enter everybody's name separated by
08:02 - comma so suppose I am entering like
08:05 - Jenny comma then I'm entering
08:09 - Akash then comma
08:12 - then I'm in entering like ankur
08:15 - and that's it and enter see
08:18 - now it is a list Jenny is one item then
08:21 - Akash then separated by
08:24 - whenever it will get it will get this
08:26 - comma it will separate from there
08:28 - now we can we can access this list the
08:31 - items of the list using index
08:33 - so I guess now it's clear to you how to
08:36 - write down this code right so I'm not
08:38 - going to print here
08:40 - fine
08:41 - now split it now what we can do this
08:44 - journey is having index 0 Akash is
08:46 - having one anchor is having two so we
08:48 - can generate a random number
08:51 - within the range 0 to 2
08:55 - 0 is the index and 2.
08:58 - right and after that according to that
09:00 - index we can
09:01 - get the name
09:03 - right
09:05 - so which is the function Rand int
09:09 - and here you can pass the range
09:12 - 0 to
09:13 - obviously I cannot write down here 0 to
09:15 - like
09:17 - I don't know like like next time I'll
09:20 - put five names
09:22 - so obviously this would not be at static
09:25 - time at this time I don't know the
09:27 - length of this list so you have to
09:29 - calculate length of the list
09:31 - this is also important so here you can
09:34 - provide
09:35 - that ending point right
09:38 - so how you can
09:41 - using Len function we have a len
09:43 - function length
09:44 - and the list is now what
09:47 - this variable
09:49 - sorry
09:53 - length and here just pass
09:56 - names list so it will find out the
09:58 - length of the list now length of this
10:00 - list is
10:02 - one two three okay so it will give you
10:04 - three so let us just
10:08 - store that thing into a variable suppose
10:10 - I am taking
10:11 - length
10:13 - okay
10:14 - but so here what will you will pass
10:18 - length no because Rand n12
10:22 - return an integer between 0 to length in
10:26 - this case suppose we are taking this
10:27 - list in this case length is 3 so 0 to 3
10:30 - including 3 also
10:32 - and whenever it will return three
10:33 - suppose so at third index we don't have
10:37 - anything
10:38 - right
10:39 - so what name it will ping it will pick
10:42 - nothing
10:44 - so what you will pass Here length minus
10:46 - 1 till length minus 1 because the index
10:49 - is 0 1 2 length is 3 so 3 minus 2 sorry
10:55 - 3 minus 1 that is 2 till 2 so 0 to 2
10:58 - including both 0 and 2 yeah that is fine
11:00 - now I hope you go to Y I am putting the
11:02 - range 0 to length minus 1 right
11:06 - now
11:07 - okay
11:08 - so it will generate any
11:11 - random integer number between 0 to
11:13 - whatever the length of the string minus
11:15 - 1. so that I am going to suppose uh
11:19 - store in a
11:20 - variable
11:22 - random
11:24 - choice
11:27 - in this variable
11:29 - right
11:30 - now suppose it has picked
11:33 - 0 to now suppose list is this 0 to 2 so
11:37 - it has to randomly 1. so in random
11:40 - choice we have now one
11:42 - so obviously we can at one we have Akash
11:45 - so we can access hakash
11:47 - we know how to access how to access just
11:51 - name of the list
11:52 - names underscore list that this variable
11:55 - is this names underscore list and in
11:57 - square bracket just pass one note one
12:00 - but obviously we are passing this
12:03 - variable random choice
12:06 - right and we can simply print this
12:09 - in print we can
12:12 - do this
12:13 - this thing right and if you properly
12:16 - want to
12:17 - write down like Akash will pay the bill
12:20 - so okay we can do that thing also in
12:23 - print we can use F string f
12:27 - and from here
12:31 - from here we can just access this this
12:35 - will
12:38 - pay the bill how to use a string if you
12:40 - don't know you can check out my previous
12:42 - video I'll put in this I button you can
12:44 - check out that video right okay sorry
12:47 - now from this variable it will pick so
12:50 - this will pay the bill right
12:53 - now I hope you got this this is that's
12:55 - it now
12:57 - okay let's run this and see you're
12:59 - getting the output or not
13:03 - phony
13:05 - let's enter
13:08 - okay sorry we cannot use this Rand in
13:11 - function like this my mistake
13:13 - we have to use random dot Rand hint like
13:16 - this
13:17 - okay
13:19 - I was just checking you are attentive or
13:21 - not
13:23 - okay jokes apart let's run run this
13:25 - again and
13:28 - see this time ankur will pay the bill
13:31 - maybe next time you will get other thing
13:33 - suppose we are
13:37 - see this time I am getting Jenny will
13:39 - pay the bill okay
13:41 - so this is how you can do without using
13:44 - Choice method I hope you go to this
13:48 - thing it's not that much tough right
13:51 - if you are not getting you can just
13:52 - watch the video again right now if you
13:56 - use that choice then no need to just
14:00 - calculate the length you can just
14:02 - comment out these two lines
14:05 - we have the list now now we can directly
14:08 - use like random Dot
14:11 - choice and this here just pass the list
14:15 - names list
14:17 - and whatever it will return suppose that
14:20 - name I am storing in the
14:23 - name person
14:26 - selected right
14:29 - so rather than this now at this time I
14:32 - am using what here
14:34 - person selected
14:36 - right
14:45 - say this time also
14:47 - okay not Jenny's it's Jenny
14:51 - but anyway we can write down Jenny also
14:53 - Jenny will pay the bill so simply using
14:57 - choice you have to write down just one
14:59 - line
15:00 - random load Choice the list it will pick
15:02 - the name the name suppose I am going to
15:05 - put in this variable person selected and
15:07 - from this variable we can just
15:09 - in F string we can pass this variable
15:11 - name all right
15:13 - or rather than this we can just do this
15:16 - thing in one line only
15:17 - F string from here
15:19 - here only we can write down this thing
15:21 - dynamodore Choice names list directly
15:24 - right
15:28 - say this time it is giving Akash will
15:31 - pay the bill right so I hope this is
15:34 - clear to you now the random module
15:36 - random function how to use them how to
15:38 - solve a problem using random functions
15:40 - at all right so now in the next video
15:42 - we'll see nested list so now we'll see
15:44 - the next video till then bye take care
