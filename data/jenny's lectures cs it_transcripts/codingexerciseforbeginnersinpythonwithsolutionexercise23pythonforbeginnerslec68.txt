00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language in the
00:04 - previous video we have discussed about
00:05 - dictionaries in Python right now in this
00:09 - video we will see when coding exercise
00:11 - based on dictionary so I would recommend
00:13 - please watch out that video first then
00:15 - come to this video now what is this
00:17 - coding exercise
00:18 - first thing we have a dictionary right
00:21 - now we have like marks of students in
00:25 - the form of dictionary as you can see on
00:27 - my screen this is a dictionary student
00:28 - Mark and here I am having name of the
00:31 - students and their marks right names are
00:35 - keys and their marks are values key and
00:38 - value pair we are having this dictionary
00:40 - we have so you can note down this thing
00:42 - now what you have to do you have to
00:44 - write down a program that will convert
00:46 - these given marks into grades
00:51 - so basically now you have to make
00:54 - another dictionary whatever name you can
00:56 - take like student underscore grade you
00:58 - can take and in that dictionary name of
01:01 - the students would be as a tease but
01:03 - rather than marks grades would be there
01:08 - you have to convert those marks into
01:11 - grades and what are the criteria
01:13 - if marks are between 91 200 then grade
01:16 - is a plus 81 to 90 a 71 to 80 B plus
01:20 - like this this is the grading system you
01:23 - have to provide below 40 it's F so you
01:26 - can just note down this thing also okay
01:28 - now you have that student marked
01:31 - dictionary you have the grading system
01:33 - now you have to convert
01:36 - you have to just access what marks of
01:38 - the student and you have to put if
01:40 - condition if grade is between this then
01:43 - like grade so like you know marks is
01:46 - greater than 90 so grade is a plus so
01:48 - what you will do
01:50 - the hint is you can take an empty
01:52 - dictionary student grade and in that
01:54 - dictionary you can just put student
01:55 - names and then
01:57 - grade rather than marks
01:59 - I hope now we are getting my point so
02:02 - please laugh pause the video and give it
02:04 - a try
02:05 - so I hope you have tried this out now
02:07 - let's do this exercise together create a
02:10 - new file and you'll see we'll write down
02:14 - coding exercise
02:16 - underscore
02:17 - dictionaries date Dot py okay now just
02:24 - make that same student marks that
02:27 - dictionary okay
02:29 - so now this dictionary we have student
02:31 - marks
02:32 - how how you will do that thing to access
02:35 - these marks using keys we can access
02:39 - so you have to Loop through this
02:40 - dictionary first gen you will access
02:43 - then marks then on marks will put some
02:44 - condition then Harry then marks them on
02:47 - that we'll put some condition so for
02:49 - Loop four
02:51 - student in
02:54 - student marks
02:56 - see this thing we have discussed in
02:57 - previous video if I write down this
02:59 - thing then this student this for Loop if
03:02 - I print student then this for Loop will
03:03 - access all the keys all the keys only
03:06 - right
03:08 - that way that's why I recommend you to
03:10 - watch previous video first so now
03:12 - in student we are having first Jenny
03:14 - then Harry dimpy Rahul aniketh and Prem
03:16 - like this so according to this journey
03:19 - we can access the marks how we can
03:21 - access the marks
03:23 - we are taking a variable marks and how
03:25 - we will access
03:27 - the dictionary name student marks and in
03:30 - bracket just provide the key so first
03:34 - key would be in student this variable
03:37 - right
03:38 - so first time in student in this
03:40 - variable what would be assigned
03:43 - generally
03:46 - now student marks Jenny student marks
03:49 - Jennifer and marks is the student
03:50 - magazine in 92 so 92 would be fetched in
03:52 - this line and in marks now we have 92.
03:57 - now we can put condition on marks so if
04:01 - Mass greater than 90 okay
04:06 - then
04:07 - now what you have to make because you
04:10 - will not change in this dictionary so we
04:12 - will make a second dictionary so let's
04:14 - take an empty dictionary
04:16 - student grade
04:19 - this is what it's an empty dictionary
04:21 - now in student grade we have to put
04:27 - the student name as key and
04:30 - this grade of the student as
04:35 - values right so
04:38 - the name of the dictionary is student
04:40 - grades empty dictionary and in bracket
04:44 - same obviously the name should be same
04:47 - these Keys would be same in both the
04:49 - dictionaries so just same key student
04:52 - whatever the case student
04:54 - and here what you will assign
04:56 - according to this grade is a plus
05:01 - I hope you heard this process see now
05:03 - marks till now marks 92 so check 92
05:07 - greater than 90 yes condition true
05:08 - condition true means you will enter in
05:10 - this control and student grade this is
05:13 - an empty dictionary in student right now
05:16 - we are having Jenny so
05:19 - the key would be have to add an element
05:21 - that also we have discussed right so
05:23 - Jenny a plus would be added to this
05:26 - student grade first item Jenny a plus
05:29 - key and value pair right like this we
05:31 - will do for all the conditions right
05:33 - second condition is
05:34 - alif
05:37 - marks greater than 80.
05:40 - right in that case same in student
05:43 - grades and
05:45 - student
05:47 - what you will
05:49 - put a
05:51 - right
05:53 - like this I guess you can put all the
05:55 - conditions in else simply f
05:58 - and after that after this for Loop we
06:01 - are going to just print
06:03 - student grade this dictionary
06:06 - right
06:08 - so let's run this and see
06:11 - see
06:12 - Jenny a plus Harry B plus dimpy C Rahul
06:17 - D again A Plus and frame f
06:22 - I hope you got this see no need to put
06:24 - this condition maybe you are confused
06:25 - here you should put marks greater than
06:27 - 80 and
06:28 - less than 90 no need to put these and
06:32 - condition because see if suppose let's
06:35 - take one condition one example marks 82
06:39 - so first thing first this if condition
06:42 - would be checked 82 greater than 90 no
06:44 - so obviously this will not enter the
06:47 - control will not enter into this if else
06:49 - if second condition is true yes then a
06:52 - would be printed suppose marks 92.
06:56 - first this if condition would be checked
06:58 - 92 greater than 90 yes condition true so
07:01 - in this
07:01 - control we will enter in this block and
07:03 - a plus
07:04 - right
07:06 - so if this condition has been triggered
07:08 - then all the other condition would be
07:10 - skipped so no need to put logical and
07:12 - condition like greater than 80 and less
07:14 - than 90 greater than 70 and less than
07:17 - it is something like this no this one
07:19 - condition is NF now if you are not
07:21 - getting this thing you can just write
07:23 - down this thing uh all the you know code
07:25 - in a piece of paper and write on this
07:27 - thing with different different example
07:29 - different different marks of the
07:31 - students one by one with hand you can
07:33 - write on this and definitely it's not so
07:35 - messed up right so that's it and sorry
07:38 - to frame if anyone who is watching whose
07:41 - name is brain because
07:42 - I give only 34 marks
07:45 - but that is just an example okay okay so
07:48 - I hope you got this exercise this was
07:49 - not so much tough and actually we will
07:52 - see nested dictionaries as well as list
07:54 - so now I'll say the next video till then
07:55 - bye take care
