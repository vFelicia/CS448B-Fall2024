00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:04 - C++ programming language in the previous
00:05 - video we have seen what is Vector of
00:08 - pairs right I hope that is clear to you
00:10 - guys because based on that only we'll be
00:12 - discussing one coding exercise in this
00:13 - video right it's not stough simple one
00:17 - what is this exercise let's see you are
00:19 - given a vector of size n which holds
00:22 - pair of integer pair of integers right
00:25 - now you have to calculate some of the
00:27 - second element of these pairs second
00:30 - element of these pairs right means 2 +
00:33 - 10 +
00:35 - -4 you have to calculate this thing
00:38 - right I hope you are getting the problem
00:41 - statement right and it's not tough you
00:44 - have to just access the second element
00:47 - of the pairs within this Vector right I
00:52 - hope you can do this now you have to
00:54 - pause the video and try this out so
00:56 - let's create a new file and we are going
00:58 - to solve this now so now first take the
01:03 - vector which is given Vector of pair not
01:05 - Vector it's Vector of pair having
01:08 - integer value both integer value
01:11 - right okay now let's suppose we have
01:13 - vector v and the values given are first
01:18 - is 1 two right so how to access second
01:22 - element from these pairs so obviously we
01:25 - have to trace the vector first first
01:27 - element of the vector is 1 2
01:30 - this is first element having a pair
01:32 - means pair means two values this is
01:34 - second element of vector means V of Zer
01:38 - at zero index we have this pair at one
01:40 - index we have this pair at second index
01:43 - we have this pair every index are having
01:45 - two values because we have a pair right
01:48 - okay now with the help of four Loop
01:50 - let's trace this one first first element
01:54 - then second element of vector then third
01:55 - element of vector if we got the first
01:57 - element of the vector like one two pair
02:00 - then within that we can access this two
02:03 - do second keyword we have right do first
02:06 - and do second this is how we are going
02:07 - to access elements of pair right so here
02:12 - let's take first obviously we will take
02:16 - a variable sum in which you're going to
02:19 - store the sum and let's initialize it
02:21 - with zero so that it will not take any
02:23 - garbage value simply we take a variable
02:27 - this is what you can say traditional way
02:29 - of using food Loop like a variable
02:31 - initialize it with zero and this I would
02:33 - be less than till Vector size so we have
02:38 - a function here in Vector do size to
02:41 - calculate the size automatically it will
02:43 - calculate the size then Plus+ I or I ++
02:47 - and within this you have to do what you
02:51 - have to access now from V
02:53 - ofi from V of I now V of Z means this
02:58 - first element but you have to access
03:00 - only two so voi dot second because one
03:05 - two is
03:06 - pair first first element of pair is one
03:09 - second element is two so dot second I
03:11 - want to access right so the the second
03:15 - element of all the pairs and just add
03:18 - this two into sum so sum equal to sum
03:22 - plus v ofi do second I hope you got why
03:25 - I have written this line or we can
03:27 - simply write down if you use that short
03:30 - end operator then Su plus equal to v i
03:33 - do second right I hope it works okay
03:37 - first obviously you have to now print
03:41 - that sum so let's print simply sum
03:45 - and returns Z okay let's run this and
03:50 - see what output you are getting now 8 so
03:54 - see 10 + 2 12 - 4 it's 8 right okay it's
04:00 - working fine if you don't use this kind
04:02 - of loop we can use that range based for
04:04 - Loop also all right for that what we
04:07 - will
04:08 - do that is I guess very simple just
04:12 - write down this Auto keyword Auto and
04:15 - any variable name suppose I'm taking
04:18 - element and from which range which
04:20 - container I'm going to take the elements
04:22 - from V from this vector v
04:25 - right so it means from vector v 1X one
04:28 - all the elements would be stored stor in
04:30 - this variable so first this one two this
04:33 - pair would be stored in this
04:36 - element I mean in this variable variable
04:39 - name is element or we can take n any
04:42 - small name we can take n in this
04:44 - variable n 1 2 from this N I want to
04:48 - exess Second element of the pair because
04:50 - this one two is
04:52 - pair because first element of the vector
04:54 - is pair second element is also a pair
04:56 - obviously it is Vector of pairs right
05:01 - so this time what you can do su is equal
05:04 - to sum
05:05 - plus now from this n you have to access
05:08 - now in N we have this pair 1 2 so n dot
05:15 - second and
05:17 - semicolon right you know you know no
05:21 - need to worry about the size and all
05:23 - like this so I like this Loop in this
05:27 - you know range based for Loop so let's
05:30 - print some and uh let's run this and see
05:33 - we're getting same output or not yeah we
05:36 - getting eight right I hope you've done
05:38 - this exercise right it's not so much Stu
05:40 - so try out different different exercises
05:42 - on the vectors Pairs and Vector of pairs
05:46 - right in the next video we'll see most
05:48 - probably nesting of vectors like array
05:51 - of vectors and Vector of vectors what is
05:53 - the difference between these two things
05:54 - because these are very confusing array
05:57 - of vectors and Vector of vectors so the
05:59 - this thing we'll be discussing in next
06:00 - video right you please try out different
06:02 - different exercises based on whatever
06:06 - topic we are going we are covering in
06:07 - this cabus in this course because for me
06:10 - it's not possible to you
06:12 - know uh cover all the or you know uh
06:15 - discuss all the exercises on all the
06:19 - topics one or two exercise I can discuss
06:21 - but I'll I'm I'm not trying to cover all
06:25 - the you know that concept or theory part
06:27 - in detail right but for now I guess
06:30 - that's it for this video now I'll see
06:32 - you in the next video till then bye-bye
06:34 - take care
