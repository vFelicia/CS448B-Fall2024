04:10 - such it is a theoretical subject and I
04:14 - want to discuss more about practical
04:16 - subjects so if I deliver a lecture on
04:19 - software engineering I guess you will
04:20 - get bored I am sure because that is
04:22 - theoretical such
04:24 - it but okay I'll I'll think about that
04:26 - about software engineering videos - okay
