00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - C++ programming language in the previous
00:05 - video we have seen what are Ned loops
00:07 - and when and why to use n Loops So based
00:10 - on that we will see one coding exercise
00:12 - in this video right so what you have to
00:14 - do is you have to write down a program
00:16 - to calculate sum of product of all the
00:19 - pairs of this aray elements this is one
00:22 - array having 10 1 3 - 4 7 5 these
00:25 - elements you have to find out first the
00:27 - pair all the pair of these elements and
00:30 - then sum of the product of all the pairs
00:33 - this thing you have to do if you got
00:35 - this problem statement then you can
00:37 - pause the video and try this out right
00:38 - now but if not then it's okay let me
00:41 - explain a little bit further the main
00:43 - problem here is how to find out the pair
00:45 - of AR element for that you will need two
00:48 - Loops right and then you have to do the
00:50 - product of the pair and then sum of
00:52 - product of all the pairs right but
00:55 - before explaining this concept here I
00:57 - just want to tell you something if you
00:59 - guys are preparing for gate 2024 exam
01:01 - then I have an exciting news for you

02:15 - going to sit in the actual uh you know
02:17 - gate exam so now it's time to test your
02:19 - preparation for gate 2024 right so the
02:22 - enrollment link as well as the other
02:24 - relevant information about this test
02:26 - I'll put in the description box of this
02:28 - video you can go and check out right now
02:31 - let's discuss how to find out the pair
02:34 - of Arrow elements so you have to find
02:37 - out the pairs of these AR elements pairs
02:39 - means this 10 pair of this 10 with one
02:43 - something like this next pair is 10 with
02:46 - 3 then 10 - 4 then 10 7 and then 10
02:52 - 5 right it's not like that you have now
02:56 - for one next element is one now find out
02:58 - pair of one so it's not like that 1 and
03:01 - 10 is a pair no this and this these both
03:03 - are same right so this is not a pair the
03:07 - pair is 1 3 1 - 4 1 7 and 1
03:14 - 5 now for three How many pairs 3 1 3 10
03:19 - no because we have already 10 1 1 and 3
03:23 - so if you write down 3 1 that is same as
03:25 - 1 3 so no duplicate pair now 3 - 4 3 3 -
03:30 - 4 3 7 and 3 5 same for - 4 7 - 4 5 and
03:38 - then 75 these are all the pairs for
03:41 - these array elements right first you
03:43 - have to find out these pairs then you
03:46 - have to do the product like 10 into 1 is
03:49 - 10 then plus 10 into 3 is 30 then plus
03:53 - 10 into -4 is -40 like this product and
03:57 - then sum of all the products
04:00 - so the main thing is to find out these
04:02 - pairs how you will find out these pairs
04:05 - this thing we will do with nested Loops
04:07 - you have to use nested Loop because if
04:09 - you find out the pair for 10 then 10
04:13 - then 1 3 - 4 75 then for 1 3 - 4 7 5
04:18 - like this so like index is 0 1 2 3 or
04:23 - let me just take a different color pen
04:26 - so index is 0 1 2 3 4 4
04:30 - 5 so first exess the element 10 which is
04:33 - at zero index then pair it
04:36 - with the element at next index that is
04:41 - one then same 10 will pair with next
04:45 - element that is three till end of the
04:48 - array right when you take this when you
04:51 - access this element one then pair it
04:54 - with next element only not the previous
04:56 - one next element so two Loops you will
04:59 - need one is I one is J right so in I we
05:05 - have these these values 10 10 10 10 and
05:09 - in J we have like 1 3 - 4 7 5 like this
05:13 - now this is I this is J here we have I
05:16 - is three this is j i is same but J is
05:20 - changing for this iteration
05:23 - also
05:25 - right so how you will do that I hope now
05:29 - you got the basic idea of doing this
05:31 - program it's not so much time right now
05:35 - pause the video and try this out so I
05:37 - hope you have done this let's create a
05:39 - new file coding
05:41 - sicise and first obviously you have to
05:44 - include that iio stream header then we
05:48 - have to use we have to use that
05:50 - namespace
05:52 - STD and now in main function let's start
05:57 - doing coding right okay so this array we
05:59 - have the name of the array is
06:02 - data you have to find out the total so
06:05 - let's take a variable total and
06:06 - initialize it with zero now as we have
06:09 - discussed we need a for Loop first so in
06:11 - I is equal to a index should be start
06:14 - starts from zero so let's initialize
06:16 - this with with zero because you have to
06:19 - access these elements of the array so at
06:21 - zero index we have 10 so in I is equal
06:24 - to this and I should be less than 6 the
06:28 - length of that
06:30 - and I
06:31 - ++
06:33 - right now to find out the pair now
06:37 - I zero so at first we have 10 now you
06:41 - have to find out the pair of this 10 so
06:43 - 10 1 10 3 10 - 4 10 7 and 10 5 so we'll
06:50 - start finding pair from the next element
06:52 - 10 1 the first pair would be something
06:54 - like this 10 and one the next element
06:58 - from this 10 so the inner for Loop inner
07:01 - for Loop would be initialized from
07:05 - whatever the I +
07:06 - one with the next element and J should
07:10 - be less than same six and
07:14 - j++ right okay now we have
07:22 - this now you have to find out the total
07:25 - right so total we are going to update
07:27 - this total with product of all the pairs
07:31 - so you have to find out you have to
07:33 - fetch whatever the data at first I index
07:37 - then we'll do
07:40 - into the
07:42 - data
07:44 - at ZF index because this this is I this
07:48 - 10 is at I this one is at J now at first
07:54 - right and then that product would be
07:57 - added to this total so Plus equal to
08:00 - this right now after these two for Loops
08:03 - out of these two for Loops you have to
08:06 - print what whatever the total is
08:17 - right and for successful completion
08:20 - return zero let's run
08:24 - this there is one error here okay you
08:27 - have to put here semicolon actually for
08:29 - so long I've been working in in Python
08:33 - so I generally forget to put the
08:36 - semicolon see the total is
08:39 - 142 so you can just find out the pair
08:43 - right and if you do product of all the
08:45 - pair you will get it 142 right I hope
08:47 - you got this the working of this thing
08:49 - if you're not getting this working you
08:51 - just uh write down this this code on a
08:54 - piece of paper and dry in this right
08:57 - then you will get it
09:00 - okay or let me dry this for you for one
09:03 - or two iteration let's see so this is
09:07 - the program the main logic right if you
09:09 - have got this how this is working you
09:11 - can just stop watching this video right
09:13 - no need to watch further but if you
09:15 - haven't got let me just dry this for you
09:19 - so we have this array and we have an
09:21 - element we have a uh sorry variable
09:23 - total at first Total is zero now in I
09:27 - here we have one more variable in this
09:28 - for Loop that is I I at first is zero
09:31 - this condition true yes so we'll enter
09:33 - here now we have another
09:36 - element let's take here J J is I + 1 so
09:41 - I is zero so J would be 1 that's exactly
09:45 - we want right why let me show you now
09:49 - condition true 1 is less than 6 okay we
09:51 - will enter here now total plus equal to
09:54 - what we'll do this is total is equal to
09:56 - Total plus this thing so data of I now I
10:00 - is zero so data of zero means at zero
10:02 - index we have 10 so at first 10 would be
10:05 - accessed into Data of
10:07 - J data of J J is now one so one at one
10:12 - we have one so into one that is 10 now
10:15 - this would be added to total now total
10:17 - becomes 10 right and this is what we
10:21 - want first pair was 10 and 1 that is y j
10:23 - is I + 1 right now after this Loop we
10:26 - have j++ we are still in Outer Loop j++
10:28 - means J becomes two condition true now
10:32 - data of I would be same that is 10
10:34 - because I is same for all the iteration
10:36 - of
10:37 - this J now right now I is 10 but J is
10:42 - now two so at two we have three = to 3
10:46 - that is 30 now 30 would be added to this
10:50 - total and it becomes 40 I hope now you
10:53 - are getting now you can do this thing
10:56 - right same for J like 3 4 4 and five so
11:01 - J is here we have 3 4 5 right once J
11:04 - becomes six exit from this and now I
11:08 - becomes one now for the same J would be
11:12 - repeated again now J becomes at first I
11:15 - is one so Z becomes at first J becomes
11:17 - two so I is 1 J is 2 like 1 3 this is
11:20 - the pair that is exactly you want 1 3
11:22 - not 1 10 right that is why we have taken
11:25 - we have initialized this J with I + 1
11:28 - right I hope you got the working of this
11:30 - program right and at last we'll P total
11:33 - right now that's it for this video now
11:35 - I'll see you in the next till the
11:37 - bye-bye take
11:43 - care
