00:00 - if you want to learn coding or if you
00:02 - have just started learning coding you
00:04 - are beginner in coding then you must
00:06 - avoid some mistakes that generally
00:08 - students do see what happens with some
00:10 - students at starting they were
00:12 - interested in learning coding but after
00:13 - some time they started losing interest
00:15 - they think that after some time they
00:17 - think that coding is not for them coding
00:19 - is not their cup of tea they can't do
00:21 - coding right
00:23 - so
00:24 - what mistakes they do while learning
00:26 - and ultimately they'll end up with
00:29 - coding is not for me
00:30 - so you have to avoid those mistakes that
00:32 - one of the biggest mistake we are going
00:34 - to discuss in this video and how to
00:36 - avoid that mistake that also we'll
00:37 - discuss
00:38 - and it's okay if you are not interested
00:40 - in coding there are some other skills
00:41 - also that you can learn and you can go
00:43 - in those fields also see its digital era
00:46 - everybody is learning some digital
00:47 - skills whether it's you know a machine
00:50 - learning
00:51 - you know cyber security cloud computing
00:53 - or digital marketing and you can also
00:56 - learn these skills for free how on skill
00:59 - app skill up is a learning platform from
01:01 - simply learn where learners can take

01:50 - the link would be in the description box
01:52 - of this video you can go and check out
01:54 - one of the biggest mistakes generally
01:55 - students do want to learn coding they
01:57 - totally depend on college to learn
01:59 - coding what they think in the first year
02:01 - in the first semester they have c then c
02:02 - plus plus in java and they learn all the
02:04 - programming languages
02:06 - in college only that is the biggest
02:07 - mistake you do please don't no depend
02:10 - don't be fully totally dependent on your
02:13 - college to learn programming yeah you
02:15 - will learn coding there you will learn
02:17 - the
02:18 - c language c plus plus but only the
02:20 - basics it's not like that after
02:21 - completing your first year you are you
02:23 - are very you know expert in c
02:25 - programming you can write down any
02:26 - program you can write down any logic in
02:28 - c programming then in c plus plus after
02:29 - second year then in java no yeah you can
02:32 - learn basics or maybe you know to some
02:35 - advanced level to intermediate level but
02:37 - not up to that level for that what you
02:39 - have to do you have to try out your own
02:42 - you have to analyze yourself you have to
02:44 - focus on yourself
02:46 - you have to put extra time extra efforts
02:49 - to learn programming to learn coding
02:51 - right
02:52 - sometimes even your basics will not be
02:54 - cleared by the college and that's true
02:56 - see i'm not saying that college
02:57 - faculties are not good they're not
02:58 - teaching very good yeah i'm getting many
03:01 - comments also like my college faculty is
03:03 - not good they are not teaching very well
03:04 - we are getting your lecture but that's
03:06 - not true they are also teaching very
03:08 - well maybe their teaching style is
03:10 - different and you are not getting that
03:12 - teaching style see in a class we have 50
03:14 - to 60 students right
03:17 - maybe in first year you have 60 students
03:20 - and obviously some students are good
03:21 - because maybe they have in 11th and 12th
03:24 - they have programming or they they have
03:25 - learned c language they have they had
03:27 - computer so they are good in programming
03:29 - or maybe they are putting extra efforts
03:32 - because sources are available
03:35 - at home only before attending the class
03:37 - they are they are you know attending
03:38 - they are watching videos from youtube
03:40 - and getting that concept
03:42 - to some what i am not saying that they
03:44 - are learning that concept properly but
03:46 - obviously they are learning something
03:47 - before going to the class so now when
03:49 - they they go to the class
03:51 - they have knowledge of that concept and
03:53 - once the faculty will teach they'll get
03:55 - that concept properly
03:57 - right that can also be a case
04:00 - and maybe you haven't studied that
04:02 - concept you think that you you totally
04:03 - dependent on your college faculty la
04:05 - i'll i'll go to the class this first of
04:08 - all this chapter or maybe like they're
04:10 - going to start adding they'll teach and
04:13 - i'll get everything in the class only no
04:14 - that is not a case that will not going
04:16 - to happen in case of programming
04:18 - languages
04:19 - you have to put extra efforts also you
04:21 - have to put extra you have to give extra
04:23 - time to learn programming right so in a
04:25 - class of 50 to 60 students maybe some
04:27 - students are good maybe some students
04:29 - are you know very good catcher maybe
04:31 - some students are they haven't they
04:33 - don't know even abcd of programming and
04:35 - they are not good catcher
04:37 - right they need time
04:39 - it's not like that in that 50-minute
04:41 - lecture whatever the faculty will teach
04:44 - you will get everything
04:45 - even no one will get everything right
04:48 - what they will do they'll study before
04:51 - the class they'll study after the class
04:52 - also
04:54 - and if you will not do that thing then
04:56 - obviously you will not get anything
04:58 - and if your basics are not clear suppose
05:01 - one concept is is done like arrays are
05:04 - done so obviously faculty will move to
05:06 - the next concept but you haven't get
05:07 - this this concept right you are that
05:10 - kind of students you know
05:12 - who who take extra time to learn the
05:15 - concepts
05:16 - you need more practice
05:18 - you need more time
05:19 - but obviously faculty is not going to
05:22 - take more time for those college
05:24 - faculties
05:25 - it's just a course and they have to
05:27 - complete it within that deadline within
05:29 - the three months or four months yeah
05:31 - that's true
05:32 - that's the harsh reality they have to
05:33 - complete it for that for those it's just
05:35 - a course and for you
05:37 - you have to learn this programming
05:39 - language before going to c plus
05:41 - otherwise if you not get c
05:43 - the same thing will happen in c plus
05:44 - plus you will not get this language also
05:46 - once your base foundation is strong you
05:48 - will get any language easily right so
05:52 - the extra time you need to put yourself
05:54 - faculty is not going to give you extra
05:56 - time
05:57 - right
05:58 - so it's not like that they are not they
05:59 - are not teaching very well yeah maybe
06:01 - their teaching style is different what
06:03 - you have to do you have to search for
06:05 - resources and resources are available
06:07 - many good resources are available
06:09 - many youtube videos tutorials are
06:12 - available you have to you know start
06:14 - watching those video tutorials from
06:16 - first from the starting right
06:18 - you can google any if you have any
06:19 - question you can google it stack
06:21 - overflow is there documentation is there
06:24 - many good websites are there to follow
06:26 - those websites some good you you know
06:28 - youtube video tutorial or some
06:30 - documentation
06:31 - you have to try out your own you have to
06:33 - put extra efforts
06:35 - you have to practice at your own because
06:37 - obviously in class then teach theory
06:39 - only or if you have practical in lab
06:41 - also
06:42 - and
06:43 - we know
06:44 - the environment of college no one is you
06:46 - know very much it's like
06:49 - interested or you can say you know aware
06:51 - at that time even students are not aware
06:53 - at that time
06:54 - they'll just time pass in the labs
06:57 - right few students are there who
06:58 - genuinely
07:00 - do the programs and practice more and
07:02 - more programs and that's the students
07:04 - and those are the students those are the
07:06 - students who learn coding and what you
07:08 - will think
07:09 - you were attending the same lab you are
07:11 - attending the same you know class the
07:13 - same faculty were teaching you but you
07:14 - are not getting you are not good at
07:16 - programming and that student is good for
07:18 - you you know good at programming and you
07:19 - think that
07:20 - coding is not you know for you it's not
07:22 - your cup of tea but that's that's not
07:24 - true maybe you were interested at
07:26 - starting at starting you were interested
07:29 - but you are that kind of person who need
07:31 - more time
07:33 - so that more time you have to give
07:35 - yourself the faculty will not give you
07:37 - that extra time
07:38 - right
07:39 - and once you will not get the concept
07:41 - like arrays
07:42 - but
07:43 - yeah you got arrays but not up to that
07:46 - level and what you think okay fine let's
07:48 - move to structure let's move to then
07:49 - union then pointers but still something
07:52 - is left you will not get arrays properly
07:54 - not the structure part or not the union
07:56 - concept not the pointer concept not the
07:59 - file handling concept and you know this
08:01 - kind of thing happens you don't ask the
08:03 - you don't ask questions you don't
08:05 - practice yourself now ultimately you
08:07 - will lose interest in programming
08:10 - right and at last you will think it's
08:12 - not my kind of thing it's not my cup of
08:13 - tea i'm not good at programming i'm not
08:15 - interested but at starting you are
08:17 - interested
08:19 - if someone is there to teach you
08:21 - properly
08:23 - each and every concept
08:25 - then maybe
08:27 - at last you were good
08:29 - and you know you would be interested in
08:31 - programming
08:32 - so for this thing you have to find out
08:35 - your own resources from starting only
08:37 - you have to find out your own resources
08:40 - youtube videos
08:42 - some websites good websites and try out
08:44 - those things right
08:46 - don't just totally dependent on college
08:49 - to learn coding and after learning
08:51 - something some concept
08:53 - start writing simple simple programs
08:55 - then some complicated type of program
08:57 - then start
08:58 - working on a project or a simple website
09:01 - right these are also available on
09:04 - social media or you can say on youtube
09:06 - many videos are available on youtube
09:08 - once in starting if you are able to
09:10 - write down some programs like obviously
09:12 - in starting you will write hello world
09:14 - program then maybe addition of two
09:16 - numbers subtraction number is even old
09:18 - factorial these kind of programs
09:20 - then ultimately you will gain interest
09:23 - right and after completing a simple
09:25 - project even if the project is very
09:26 - simple
09:27 - now you will feel you know very much
09:30 - confident in this programming and your
09:31 - interest will be at this level
09:35 - right and if your interest is there in
09:38 - programming if you are interested to
09:40 - learn programming languages or if you
09:41 - are interested to learn coding
09:43 - then no one can stop you
09:45 - it all depends on your interest and
09:47 - don't just totally be dependent on the
09:50 - college to learn coding
09:52 - so now i'll see the next video till then
09:54 - bye take care
