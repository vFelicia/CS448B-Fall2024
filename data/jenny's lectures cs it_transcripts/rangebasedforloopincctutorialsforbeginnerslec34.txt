00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - C plus plus programming language we are
00:05 - discussing Loops in C plus plus we have
00:06 - discussed four while and do while loop
00:08 - now one is linked that is range Base
00:09 - Four Loop so everything about this Loop
00:11 - we'll be discussing in this video and it
00:13 - was basically introduced in the version
00:14 - C plus plus 11 before that it was not
00:16 - there in C plus plus it is similar like
00:18 - orange Loop in Java and we also our
00:20 - range base for looking python that we
00:22 - have already discussed uh in that python
00:24 - series
00:25 - so now what is the strange based four
00:27 - five we use this how this is different
00:29 - from that additional code loop and the
00:31 - advantages of using this the benefits or
00:33 - the drawbacks everything we'll be
00:35 - discussing about this range based for
00:37 - Loop in this video with the help of
00:39 - program practical also I'll show you
00:41 - right but before that just want to tell
00:43 - you something important for those
00:45 - especially who are interested to make
00:47 - their career other full stack software
00:49 - developer because as We Know full stack
00:53 - development is one of the hottest job in
00:55 - IT industry nowadays and Odin school is
00:58 - conducting a six month boot camp full
01:01 - stack software development boot camp and
01:03 - the next cohort is going to be started
01:05 - from 27th of May so if you want to kick
01:08 - start your career in as a software full
01:10 - stack software developer join Odin
01:13 - school today because Odin schools food
01:15 - stack the software development bootcam
01:17 - is perfect for anyone who wants to
01:20 - access industry aligned education at a
01:22 - reasonable price as you can see the
01:24 - price detail here plus the important
01:26 - thing is you can also get a scholarship
01:27 - up to rupees 30 000 rupees and they have
01:30 - also a early bird offer which is in
01:32 - which you will get 10 000 off and what
01:34 - you will get in this boot camp classes
01:36 - every weekend live interactive session
01:38 - with industry experts hands-on
01:40 - experience on Project Workshop interview
01:41 - preparation placement assistance and
01:43 - many more things don't go with my words
01:45 - you can check out their success stories
01:47 - beta career launch or career upgrade or
01:49 - career growth there are many success
01:51 - stories of old in school students I they
01:55 - have 500 plus hiring Partners as you can
01:57 - see here that is Google Deloitte and
02:00 - many more top tech companies and anyone
02:03 - who is having a basic coding knowledge
02:04 - can apply for this boot camp but how to
02:06 - apply for this boot camp you just have
02:08 - to fill out these details and you can
02:09 - just request a callback sold in school
02:11 - team will call you back within one or
02:12 - two days and you can ask your doubts
02:14 - everything whatever you have your doubts
02:15 - you can ask about after that you can pay
02:17 - the fee and enroll in the boot camp so
02:19 - the relevant links and details you'll
02:21 - find in the description box of this
02:22 - video you can go and check out now let's
02:24 - see what is the strange based for Loop
02:34 - till 10. right if I say one to five
02:37 - means one two three four five it is a
02:40 - range from one to five range or you can
02:42 - say just a collection or a container
02:45 - collection of elements right or we can
02:49 - say in programming language we can say
02:51 - if I write something like this it's an
02:53 - array array is what although in C plus
02:55 - we haven't discussed error in detail
02:57 - we'll be discussing but I hope you have
02:59 - a basic idea about array
03:01 - if you have gone through those C
03:03 - programming videos
03:05 - so array is what a collection of similar
03:07 - homogeneous data type right so all the
03:10 - elements are a happy data type in data
03:12 - type so it is a collection so simply it
03:14 - is in you can say an array or you can
03:15 - say a vector
03:17 - or list is also a collection or you can
03:19 - say it's a sequence
03:20 - so range based form means this for Loop
03:23 - is basically work on the Range
03:25 - specifically on the Range or you can say
03:27 - on collections or on arrays on vectors
03:30 - on list on strings because these are
03:33 - sequence of elements
03:36 - specifically on collections this type of
03:38 - for Loop would be used now why and what
03:41 - is the advantage let me show you so see
03:45 - first of all let me just show you the
03:47 - syntax of this phone
03:50 - simply will write down this four and
03:52 - here we will write down
03:54 - range declaration so this is the general
03:57 - syntax of range base for Loop in this
04:00 - four Loop we are having only two things
04:02 - one is range declaration
04:06 - column then expression now what is this
04:08 - I'll show you and in this body of the
04:10 - loop we have some statements so
04:13 - this Loop will execute these statements
04:15 - repeatedly and sequentially if there are
04:18 - multiple statements so in a sequence
04:20 - they'll be executed so the two will
04:22 - execute these statements repeatedly and
04:24 - sequentially for each element in this
04:29 - expression range expression for each
04:32 - element right so means in this
04:34 - expression it's like when say it's a
04:36 - collection or it is a range multiple
04:38 - elements it is having right okay let's
04:40 - take one example
04:42 - I am having in simple array in type
04:44 - array suppose a
04:46 - and I am having here one two three
04:48 - elements only
04:50 - so it is what arrange till one two three
04:53 - or you can say a collection or a list or
04:55 - an array or you can say it's a container
04:57 - or a sequence of elements right now how
05:01 - to apply this four
05:04 - range declaration means declare a
05:06 - variable
05:07 - and this variable data type should be of
05:09 - same
05:11 - as these this this container data type
05:14 - or this collection data type or this
05:16 - array data type this is what in so it
05:18 - should be in any variable name you can
05:20 - take x y z a b c d anything so let's
05:22 - take B but it should be different from
05:24 - this one this name
05:26 - then column and then range expression
05:28 - the name of this this range is what a a
05:33 - just write down a here that's it
05:35 - in bracket we are not doing anything we
05:37 - are just printing these elements so just
05:40 - write down B
05:43 - and it will print one two three so this
05:47 - statement would be executed repeatedly
05:49 - for each element for each element in
05:52 - this in this expression in this a
05:55 - so for one also for two also for three
05:57 - hours also it would be executed so it
06:00 - will print one two three right
06:02 - and with the traditional Loop if you
06:04 - want to print all the elements then what
06:06 - you will do for we have to take like int
06:09 - I is equal to 0 then semicolon then I
06:13 - less than equal to you have to be aware
06:16 - about the size of this array how many
06:19 - elements are there one two three
06:20 - elements so till I less than equal to
06:23 - two or maybe less than three
06:27 - semicolon and I plus plus increment or
06:30 - decrement whatever you have to do you
06:31 - have to write and then C out
06:34 - this I
06:37 - right that's what you have to do
06:40 - so see the difference between the
06:42 - traditional Loop and this Loop here
06:45 - what you can say the benefits are no
06:47 - need to worry about the length of the
06:49 - array or the size of the array right no
06:52 - need to worry about the increment or
06:53 - decrement anything right you just need
06:57 - one iterator iterator means the B which
06:59 - is going to iterate for each element
07:01 - just an iterator right that's it
07:06 - and just write down the name of that
07:07 - collection that array and it will handle
07:09 - everything
07:12 - if you update here the size four five
07:16 - no need to update here but here you need
07:18 - to update if you want to access all the
07:20 - elements because otherwise it will
07:22 - access 0 1 2 till 2 it will come only
07:25 - three iterated iteration one two three
07:27 - four five are remaining so you have to
07:29 - update here less than five
07:31 - but he had no need to update so as you
07:34 - can see it is easy and convenient to use
07:36 - range based volume right
07:38 - over a collection
07:40 - fine but some drawbacks are
07:43 - this this
07:45 - will not
07:46 - work on the index
07:49 - right so if you want to Target a
07:51 - specific element or a element at a
07:54 - specific index we cannot Target that
07:56 - element because we are just iterating
07:58 - for f for each element we are not
08:00 - working on the index
08:03 - so we cannot it's like we want to skip a
08:05 - particular element we cannot skip that
08:06 - thing using index we cannot access or if
08:09 - you want to do so that would be very
08:10 - complex problem very complex right and
08:14 - if you want to in a reverse manner if
08:16 - you want to iterate you cannot do
08:17 - directly here
08:19 - for that also you will have to do some
08:21 - complex logic but here we can do simply
08:23 - you can iterate backward
08:26 - okay the index you can provide first of
08:28 - all
08:29 - 0 1 2 3 4 the index would be first of
08:33 - all four you can provide n i
08:36 - greater than 0 greater than equal to 0.
08:39 - that's it
08:42 - right so that would be reversibly
08:44 - printed as array so yeah there are some
08:46 - advantages of this Loop and also some
08:48 - drawbacks of range base volume okay now
08:50 - one more important point this variable
08:52 - this range declaration this variable is
08:55 - local for this for Loop you cannot
08:57 - re-declare this variable in this
08:59 - expression in this range expression or
09:02 - in these statements within this module
09:05 - if you want to declare another wave into
09:06 - B again here so that would give error
09:09 - right so you cannot re-declare this
09:11 - variable is local to this for Loop only
09:13 - right now
09:15 - if
09:17 - you you don't know like what is the data
09:20 - type of the collection you are using
09:22 - that is very complex one
09:24 - so rather than this you can simply use a
09:28 - keyword Auto
09:32 - one more headache is going for you Auto
09:35 - will automatically reduce the data type
09:39 - from the initial value see what this B
09:43 - is getting value from a so first time
09:45 - from a in B1 would be assigned right
09:49 - so it will add it will check the
09:51 - expression the data type of the
09:53 - expression is int because it is getting
09:55 - the initial value from here so the here
09:58 - the expression the data type is in so
10:00 - automatically it will deduce this to n
10:03 - so it is what known as type inference in
10:06 - C plus plus automatically deduce the
10:07 - data type of any variable or function
10:09 - right we can do with this Auto keyword
10:13 - right so that is also a plus point for
10:15 - you you don't need to worry about the
10:16 - data type of the collection you are
10:18 - using just use Auto
10:21 - and also like pass by uh by reference
10:24 - also you can pass like address of B that
10:28 - also will be discussed like call by
10:29 - value and call by reference but
10:32 - for now
10:33 - this is the basic idea of range based
10:35 - for Loop right and rather than this
10:38 - rather than using this directly
10:40 - here also we can use like one two three
10:43 - four five
10:45 - directly collection list you can put
10:48 - here right right on a vector also you
10:50 - can use Vector is nothing similar array
10:53 - similar like arrays but it's a dynamic
10:55 - array dynamically the size can be
10:57 - changes uh changed in Vector array is
11:00 - what fixed size and if Vector is what a
11:04 - dynamic array so how to declare Vector
11:07 - simply we write down Vector here we just
11:10 - run on the data type suppose
11:13 - int Vector name any name a b c x y
11:16 - anything suppose a and the values one
11:20 - two three
11:22 - that is simply vector
11:24 - so rather than a here also you can do
11:27 - like Auto B is equal to
11:30 - the vector name the expression is Vector
11:32 - name Vector name is a so just write down
11:34 - a here that is also fine
11:36 - and whatever you want to do on these
11:39 - elements you can do here here I'm just
11:41 - printing but whatever you want to do if
11:43 - you want to add or you want to find out
11:45 - maximum number minimum number or any
11:46 - logic or average anything you can do
11:48 - here right these statements whatever you
11:51 - will write
11:52 - uh this thing you need to be very you
11:55 - know clear about this thing these
11:57 - statement would be executed repeatedly
11:58 - and sequently for each element in this
12:01 - expression for each element in here in
12:03 - this expression whatever expression you
12:05 - use
12:06 - right so let's just do some practical of
12:09 - this range based for Loop okay so let's
12:11 - create a new file here and
12:14 - the name I'm taking range based full
12:16 - loop
12:17 - first of all iostream will import this
12:20 - and then
12:21 - namespace
12:23 - namespace STD
12:27 - then in Main
12:30 - and the main function we write what we
12:33 - simply take first of all array an
12:35 - example of array so a and here I am
12:38 - taking like one two three only three
12:41 - elements that's it
12:42 - semicolon very important for Loop range
12:46 - base volume so in four first declare a
12:49 - variable so rather than end just use
12:52 - Auto
12:53 - better to use
12:56 - Auto and any variable name let's take B
12:59 - and colon and then name of that range
13:02 - expression the name of this range
13:03 - expression is a so a right and then
13:08 - we are not we are not doing anything
13:10 - just C out
13:12 - we are printing this B
13:14 - and
13:16 - line
13:18 - okay and then just
13:22 - return 0.
13:25 - fine
13:26 - let's run this in
13:28 - see we are getting one two three
13:32 - the output right
13:34 - one because the statement would be
13:36 - executed for each element first time one
13:38 - would be assigned to this B one would be
13:41 - actually copied
13:42 - to this B then it would be printed then
13:45 - second second iteration 2 would be
13:47 - copied from A to B then 2 would be
13:50 - printed then third in third iteration 3
13:53 - from a would be copied to B and then it
13:57 - would be printed so actually it's called
13:59 - by value you can say all the elements
14:01 - will do three are copied basically it's
14:04 - no need to copy all the elements so we
14:08 - can this we can do pass by reference
14:10 - call by reference like we can do here
14:12 - something like this address of
14:14 - address of B is equal to a something
14:16 - like this but that will be discussing in
14:19 - other video that this video is about
14:21 - basic of uh range base for Loop rather
14:24 - than Auto if you know the data type you
14:26 - can simply write down the rate I but
14:28 - that should be same and if you don't
14:29 - want to take this headache simply write
14:31 - down your O2 automatically it will get
14:34 - the data type from the initial value of
14:36 - this B from this expression right so now
14:39 - rather than this you directly write down
14:41 - this thing like here
14:44 - rather than a if I write down
14:47 - this
14:49 - I'm not taking any this thing all right
14:53 - so now let's run this and see same
14:55 - output you will get here one two three
14:58 - right okay
15:00 - now let's do this on Vector I am taking
15:04 - a vector vector is nothing but a dynamic
15:07 - array vector and the syntax
15:10 - is this and data type I am taking int or
15:14 - flow to double or care any data type you
15:16 - can take int Vector name I am taking
15:19 - suppose num
15:21 - equal to
15:23 - same one three five six something like
15:26 - this
15:27 - okay
15:28 - and here same
15:30 - Vector the layer type is int so int any
15:34 - variable name I'm taking b or you can
15:36 - take like n
15:38 - and here I am taking the name of the
15:40 - expression is num okay I forgot the
15:42 - semicolon here
15:44 - right
15:45 - but see you cannot directly use Vector
15:48 - here see identifier Vector is undefined
15:50 - you have to
15:52 - import
15:53 - you have to include
15:56 - vector the sender file
16:00 - right then we can use Vector see now
16:03 - this is not giving any error see class
16:05 - STD we have Vector n in this name space
16:09 - STD
16:10 - so this is also important to import
16:13 - okay rather than V now we have variable
16:16 - name n
16:17 - so this also you need to take a let's
16:19 - run this
16:20 - and it will give you one three five six
16:23 - this output right
16:26 - on a string also we can apply this
16:29 - because string is also a range or a
16:31 - collection of characters
16:33 - so
16:35 - if I do something like this
16:39 - here and
16:42 - I'm taking like care
16:46 - see
16:48 - colon and here I'm writing Jenny
16:54 - something like this rather than N I am
16:57 - printing C now
16:59 - let's run this
17:01 - on a string also we can use this for you
17:03 - so j e n n y it will print something
17:06 - like this right
17:08 - and if I suppose update this it should
17:10 - be Jenny space
17:12 - and if I remove the C and there and just
17:14 - simply print C then it will print as it
17:17 - is Jenny Spacek
17:19 - right
17:21 - and if there is a if you want to print
17:23 - without any space so you can do
17:25 - something
17:26 - like if you can put some condition if C
17:30 - not equal to space
17:35 - then only print this C
17:37 - right
17:39 - let's run this this time it will not
17:41 - print space
17:43 - with no space so like this you can do
17:46 - something different here within this
17:49 - block it's not like that only you have
17:51 - to print whatever expression you are
17:53 - closing you know if you are using this
17:55 - Vector you can do sum so suppose one
17:58 - assignment for you is you just take a
18:00 - vector or just array
18:03 - Loop and calculate sum
18:06 - of that array or that vector or that
18:09 - collection and print the sum this is for
18:11 - your assignment what you can say your
18:12 - exercise
18:13 - you can just write down your comment
18:15 - error your code in the comment section
18:18 - so I hope you got what does range base
18:20 - for Loop in C plus plus now in next
18:21 - video we'll see one coding exercise on
18:23 - this English for Loop so now we'll see
18:24 - you next week
