00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so this video especially for
00:04 - those students who are really interested
00:06 - in learning coding and want to make
00:07 - their career in this field
00:10 - okay I'm going to tell you a great way
00:12 - to utilize your summer break this time
00:14 - and what does it see code Studio by
00:16 - coding ninjas has come up with an
00:18 - amazing 45 days coding challenge
00:21 - so you can just during your summer
00:23 - breaks solve programming challenges and
00:25 - master data structure and algorithm
00:27 - because they have designed this
00:28 - challenge in the form of complete
00:31 - roadmap for data structure and algorithm
00:33 - so it is going to be started from 2nd of
00:35 - May till 16th of June
00:37 - right and each day they'll add a new
00:40 - problem and you will get complete day to
00:42 - solve that problem submit it and next
00:44 - day you will get another problem
00:46 - and these problems will be in the
00:49 - sequence of different topics aligned for
00:52 - data structure and algorithm so here you
00:54 - can master all the essential topic of
00:56 - data structure and algorithm and ready
00:59 - for your next maybe you know internship
01:02 - and job interviews
01:04 - and the complete roadmap would be
01:05 - something like this like on day one day
01:07 - lab problem on mathematics then they do
01:08 - also mathematics day three mathematics
01:10 - then sorting then arrays then sorting
01:12 - then searching then string recursion
01:14 - hashing
01:16 - after that link list stack queues then
01:18 - trees band research Heap graph greedy
01:21 - and dynamic programming so in this
01:22 - sequence one by one each day they'll add
01:24 - one problem and you will get one
01:25 - complete day to solve that problem and
01:27 - submit your solution right on the next
01:29 - day you will get one new problem so now
01:31 - how you are going to register for this
01:33 - contest what benefit you will get why

03:25 - as you can see here
03:27 - these four are easy problems so you will
03:29 - get here 40 points 40 experience point
03:31 - you can collect these experience points
03:34 - right
03:36 - so because they have you know add some
03:39 - fun to this coding challenge they have
03:42 - improved this version
03:43 - for solving the moderate problem you
03:45 - will get 80 point for solving hard
03:47 - problem hard problem you will get 180

04:17 - I'm at level two now genius because
04:19 - level first is autocomplete
04:21 - right for everyone you will if you will
04:23 - log in here you will enter Then
04:27 - level one is auto company level two is
04:29 - what for genius time and space
04:30 - complexity basically it will compare
04:33 - your code runtime performance with your
04:37 - peers and you know it will give you
04:39 - where you are standing the percentile
04:42 - score because see these time and space
04:44 - complexity two are very important thing
04:46 - once when you will solve problem there
04:48 - are two approach one is simple one one
04:49 - is efficient one when you try to find a
04:52 - solution at first
04:54 - any solution like simple solution you
04:56 - will not care about time and space
04:57 - complexity
04:58 - but
05:00 - every obviously that interviewer expect
05:02 - you to give some efficient solution that
05:05 - take less time and space complexity
05:08 - right so this thing is also very
05:10 - important
05:11 - okay like this we have levels then if
05:15 - you get like uh 250 points then
05:19 - level level three would be unlocked and

05:31 - experience point if you have collected
05:33 - 500 points then you will get this book
05:35 - cracking the coding interview questions
05:36 - for free like this up to 10 levels you
05:39 - will be
05:40 - here right so you will unlock you can
05:43 - unlock some paid features and have to
05:45 - gain these points just solve the
05:47 - problems right okay there are some
05:51 - frequently asked questions also you can
05:53 - go there and like like what is this 45
05:55 - days challenge duration of this

06:06 - challenge then post it to your LinkedIn
06:08 - and Instagram account right and then
06:11 - start your challenge log in into the
06:12 - code Studio platform and start your
06:15 - challenge solve one problem daily and
06:17 - maintain this problem streak for 45 days
06:19 - because at last you will get completion
06:21 - certificate also so if you maintain this
06:24 - streak for 45 days then after completion
06:27 - you will get a certificate and then you
06:29 - will also get some coding ninjas amazing
06:32 - coding ninjas merchandise
06:34 - some vouchers some gifts Amazon vouchers
06:37 - like this
06:38 - so why you should take this challenge
06:41 - definitely it will help you to improve
06:43 - your you know thinking capability your
06:46 - critical thinking and develop a habit of
06:48 - coding it will improve your consistency
06:51 - right
06:52 - so and or see I have told you you can
06:55 - get an exact time complicity analysis of
06:57 - your problem and a solution in all the
06:59 - three languages C plus plus Java and
07:01 - python
07:02 - and this thing I have told you you can
07:04 - collect these this experience points and
07:08 - when you solve the problems and you can
07:09 - unlock some paid features right
07:12 - so how we are able to solve the problem
07:13 - just click on any program like this
07:15 - maximum distance and here you will get
07:18 - that problem statement where you can
07:20 - write on your code you can select your
07:22 - language like here it has photo is C
07:25 - plus plus you can select Java or
07:27 - pythoning which you are comfortable you
07:28 - can select that language you can write
07:30 - on your code and then seventh year okay
07:33 - now let me just tell you the profile how
07:36 - your profile will look once you'll click
07:38 - here you can click here your view
07:40 - profile and this type of profile this is
07:42 - your profile here how many problems you
07:45 - have solved that thing would be solved
07:46 - it will be uh seen here
07:49 - so in April like this is for April 23
07:52 - but this is going to be started from May
07:55 - so
07:56 - I know from the next month they will add
07:58 - May
08:00 - once you will solve the problem on that
08:01 - day green mark would be there right and
08:04 - this profile would be shown to the
08:07 - recruiters the highest they can directly
08:09 - see your profile from here and they can
08:11 - directly contact you so by looking at
08:13 - that profile only they will you know get
08:15 - to know it's just an indication to those
08:18 - high risk and interviewer sorry the
08:20 - recruiters that you are a good Corner if
08:23 - you maintain the consistency and your
08:25 - profile is good see I haven't solved any
08:27 - problem that is why something like zero
08:30 - total problem solved let me just show
08:33 - you one more you know so this is the
08:35 - student this is a profile of a candidate
08:38 - who is consistent who has been
08:40 - consistent on this platform right sold
08:43 - you know three five four seven total
08:45 - problems till now easy moderate hard
08:48 - problems and ninja problems so see
08:52 - the Green Dot
08:54 - see the analysis better than 99 contest
08:57 - attended 13 attended and like the source
08:59 - this kind of profile
09:02 - so it's I think I would recommend to
09:04 - maintain this kind of profile
09:06 - if you really want to get a good
09:09 - placement
09:11 - and you can attempt this this thing on
09:13 - this contest on board Studio only right
09:15 - so I guess this is a very good idea to
09:18 - spend year to utilize your summer breaks
