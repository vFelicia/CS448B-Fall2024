00:01 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:04 - Python programming language we have
00:05 - discussed modules and packages in Python
00:08 - right so now in this video we'll be
00:10 - discussing what is turtle module from
00:13 - this video onwards we'll be discussing
00:15 - about this Turtle modu right because we
00:17 - are discussing this thing in deep so it
00:20 - would take like two to three videos at
00:22 - least to cover this thing in detail
00:24 - right so what is turtle module how to
00:27 - use this how to check if this module you
00:30 - have in your you know uh system or not
00:32 - because generally this Turtle module is
00:35 - pre-installed it's a library which is
00:37 - pre-installed in your python when you
00:38 - install python then it's automatically
00:40 - installed uh in your python right so
00:43 - don't need to install it separately but
00:46 - if you don't have you need to install it
00:47 - separately right how to check that also
00:49 - I'll show you the command right and how
00:51 - to use this that also we'll see right
00:54 - now till now we have discussed we have
00:56 - return program we have uh you know
00:58 - created projects
01:00 - but with those project in those project
01:03 - output was on that particular you know
01:05 - that black screen or that console in the
01:07 - form of text only we get output and all
01:10 - right but now we want to use Graphics
01:15 - animations right some interesting we
01:18 - want to do so for that we need a you can
01:22 - say a module or you library that is
01:24 - turtle and it is very simple one that is
01:26 - why we are using first we are you know
01:29 - learning this Turtle module have you
01:31 - heard about a programming language logo
01:33 - that programming language is you know
01:36 - widely known for its
01:38 - use uh of this Turtle Graphics right and
01:41 - that was logo was generally for you know
01:44 - basically was for kids to make the
01:46 - language or you know interesting so it's
01:50 - a pre-installed library right and
01:52 - basically it is used to create different
01:55 - kind of shapes images geometric
01:58 - animations like you know uh like Square
02:02 - draw a line rectangle triangle simple
02:06 - simple simple uh you know uh you can say
02:10 - drawings or simple shapes as well as to
02:12 - the complex one right we will be
02:14 - discussing everything one by one first
02:16 - we'll start from simple one I have to
02:18 - draw a line then like a circle triangle
02:21 - rhombus and then more complex shapes
02:25 - we'll be discussing more complex
02:26 - geometric animations actually animations
02:29 - also see right so this Turtle Library
02:33 - contains all the methods and functions
02:36 - that you know we need to draw the images
02:41 - shapes or drawings or pictures right now
02:45 - this Turtle Graphics is similar to a you
02:48 - can say virtual canvas on canvas
02:50 - actually we draw something painting or
02:52 - and drawing or anything so it's like a
02:54 - virtual canvas for us right on which we
02:56 - are going to draw our pictures or shapes
02:59 - or images or drawings anything right and
03:02 - it also you know provide us a on screen
03:05 - pen actually that pen is actually a
03:07 - turtle you can say right that we use to
03:10 - draw okay those shapes or designs fine
03:14 - so it's like a turtle with paint brush
03:18 - on his back so whenever the turtle will
03:20 - move that paint brush will obviously
03:23 - draw something so if turtle is going
03:25 - this direction then paint brush is going
03:27 - this direction so means like a line then
03:29 - this way this this like this so it's
03:32 - like a turtle actual turtle with a paint
03:36 - brushed on his back this kind of thing
03:40 - right so you just have to import this
03:43 - Turtle module and all the methods and
03:46 - functions you will get you can use all
03:48 - the methods and functions of this Turtle
03:51 - Library which we will use to create our
03:54 - shapes and drawings and everything right
03:57 - now first let's check if this is
03:59 - installed on your PC like in your python
04:02 - or not this Library so how to check I'll
04:05 - show you okay so uh let's create a new
04:14 - project rather than creating a file we
04:17 - creating a new project right and the
04:19 - name I'm giving Turtle
04:28 - project so here we have a turtle project
04:31 - and in this project I'm going to create
04:33 - now a new file turtle1
04:38 - dopy but first let me just check if you
04:40 - have
04:41 - this uh using that on command prompt if
04:44 - you want to check then how you have how
04:46 - to check what is the command so you just
04:48 - have to search for command prompt
04:55 - CMD and
04:57 - here do you have have python in your PC
05:01 - so if you want to check the version then
05:03 - how you can
05:04 - check python Das Dash version so I have
05:08 - python 3.1.8 right so three is like
05:11 - major minor than patch this is that you
05:14 - can say that
05:16 - pattern now I want to check I have this
05:19 - module or not so how to check just have
05:21 - to use Python hyphen M module and module
05:25 - name is
05:28 - Turtle so see if this command will give
05:31 - any error then it means you don't have
05:33 - this Library pre-installed so you have
05:35 - to install it separately right for that
05:38 - also if you're getting any error I'll
05:40 - tell you we'll make a separate video but
05:41 - see right now I have this kind of thing
05:44 - so yeah I have this Turtle Graphics
05:46 - python Turtle Graphics it's kind of a
05:49 - virtual canvas and on this this drawing
05:52 - and all maybe you think that it's not
05:54 - showing any turtle and all so it's
05:56 - showing this Arrow but yeah this arrow
05:59 - is like a
06:00 - virtual pen or a turtle we can change
06:02 - the shape of this arrow that Al I'll
06:04 - show you but if this kind of things if
06:06 - it is showing then definitely it's
06:07 - pre-installed and you can just import it
06:09 - and you can just use it right so now see
06:14 - as you can see here we have multiple
06:16 - Turtles on this canvas like one turtle
06:19 - is chasing another turtle there are many
06:21 - turtles so this thing also we can do we
06:23 - can create multiple Turtles on a single
06:25 - screen right now how to use this thing
06:29 - let me just show you so first if you
06:32 - want to use any method or any function
06:35 - of a pre-installed library or a module
06:37 - then you have to import that module
06:39 - first so just import name of the module
06:41 - is Turtle see it's case sensitive python
06:44 - is case sensitive so you have to be very
06:47 - careful it's turtle in small case it's
06:49 - not like that if you write down capital
06:52 - T turtle and if I run this then let me
06:56 - just show you what kind of thing you
06:57 - will get see module not found error no
07:02 - module name Turtle right so you have to
07:05 - be very specific while writing the names
07:07 - and
07:08 - all it's small T see it's not giving any
07:12 - error now right now import totle means
07:15 - now we can use any functions or methods
07:17 - which are in this Turtle module right
07:21 - okay now
07:23 - see if I write down here so obviously
07:26 - you need a
07:27 - screen a virtual canvas right to draw
07:31 - something so there are also multiple
07:33 - ways I'll show you everything so there
07:36 - is a method see
07:39 - Turtle obviously to use any method or
07:41 - function from this module first of all
07:43 - you have to write what is the syntax the
07:44 - module name dot we have a see method as
07:49 - you can see get
07:51 - screen right let's run this so it will
07:55 - show you the screen okay let me just
07:57 - show you see but the screen was just
08:00 - blink and disappear so you have to hold
08:02 - that screen for that also we have like
08:05 - a turtle dot we have a method only one
08:11 - method I'm going to show you right now
08:13 - but one by one I'll show you everything
08:16 - right there are multiple ways to hold
08:18 - that screen so we have a method C exit
08:20 - on click so whenever you will click on
08:23 - that screen at that time only it will
08:25 - exit so let's run this now see it's a
08:27 - virtual canvas right and this arrow in
08:30 - the center by default it would be in
08:33 - Center so it's kind of pen for us or you
08:35 - can say it's kind of a turtle it's a
08:37 - turtle maybe you are thinking it's an
08:39 - arrow not Turtle but you can change the
08:41 - shape of this thing it's like pen for us
08:43 - right so when you you click here then it
08:46 - will
08:47 - exit fine okay now obviously exit on
08:51 - click would be your last method so after
08:54 - getting the
08:55 - screen if you want to move your turtle
09:00 - forward then how we will move Turtle dot
09:04 - we have many methods and things here so
09:07 - I'll show you one by one every method
09:09 - but simple one I'm going to show you in
09:11 - this video then in later videos we will
09:13 - be discussing complex one so forward we
09:17 - have a method forward see forward and
09:20 - bracket you will write down the
09:23 - distance distance in unit or you can say
09:26 - this distance would be in pixels so I'm
09:28 - suppos WR 100 so it is going to move
09:31 - your turtle
09:33 - forward 100 pixels right on the screen
09:37 - like one dot is one pixel then second
09:39 - dot second pixel like this right so 100
09:41 - pixel now in which direction your turtle
09:44 - is heading head like my face is in this
09:48 - direction so I'll move forward means
09:50 - I'll move in this direction 100 steps
09:52 - right if my face is in this direction
09:54 - forward means I'll move in this
09:55 - Direction only 100 steps right so let's
09:58 - run this and I'll show you
10:02 - see now initially here was the turtle
10:05 - and then here is my turtle right 100
10:09 - steps fine if you want to change the
10:12 - shape here so we have like uh we have a
10:17 - a method
10:19 - shape shape see shape and then you have
10:22 - to the name
10:26 - so
10:28 - turtle I want to change this to Turtle
10:31 - see now as you can see it's a turtle now
10:34 - so maybe you're thinking you how how do
10:36 - I know all these thing like forward
10:38 - shape and what should I give here turtle
10:40 - and all so obviously I don't remember
10:43 - everything few functions only I remember
10:46 - but what you need to do you don't have
10:47 - to remember everything and every method
10:49 - and everything here we have a python
10:52 - documentation just go there on Google
10:55 - you just have to search turtle python
10:57 - documentation and the first link
11:00 - is this turtle turtle Graphics right so
11:05 - there see using this we can make these
11:08 - kind of shapes as well Turtle star so
11:10 - here you here you will get the tutorial
11:13 - everything about Turtle see
11:16 - forward so this is like basic thing
11:19 - forward Left Right everything I'll show
11:22 - you so here you will get all the methods
11:25 - let me just show you
11:27 - see forward if you click on forward it
11:30 - will show how to use this Turtle dot
11:32 - forward and in bracket you have to give
11:34 - distance now here we have small form uh
11:37 - you can say short hand or small form of
11:40 - these methods like rather than forward
11:42 - complete you can just write down FD that
11:44 - is also same so Turtle Lo FD distance
11:46 - distance is a number integer or float
11:48 - right so it's move the turtle forward in
11:50 - the specified by the specified distance
11:53 - in the direction the turtle is headed so
11:56 - backward if you want to move the turtle
11:58 - to move move backward then there is
12:00 - three method you either you can write
12:01 - down backward or BK or back and just
12:04 - provide distance so here you will get
12:08 - everything every method right and I have
12:11 - also shown you that uh what shape method
12:15 - that also I'll show you this
12:17 - see Turtle State this is visibility this
12:20 - is appearance so appearance of turtle
12:22 - means shape this is a method shape
12:24 - Turtle Lo shape and the name you have to
12:26 - give here now what is this name what
12:29 - name you can give
12:30 - here so can I give name as equal to
12:33 - Jenny and it will change the shape to
12:35 - Jenny no there are some specific name
12:37 - only you can give and these are
12:40 - C you can give out of these names Arrow
12:44 - Turtle circle square triangle and
12:48 - classic right so first go through this
12:51 - documentation it's not like that you
12:53 - have to go through this documentation
12:54 - properly each and every method and all
12:56 - and then only just use tole graph and
12:59 - try to write down program
13:01 - no just write down start writing
13:03 - programs what you want to draw like a
13:06 - square for that what method you need
13:10 - like move Circle forward then you have
13:12 - to turn that Circle so for that you can
13:14 - check how to move Turtle forward how to
13:17 - change the direction like angle and all
13:19 - left or right and
13:21 - all practically you have to do practical
13:26 - parall
13:27 - okay so this is how you can use this
13:35 - shape so whatever method you need for
13:37 - your project you can just go to this
13:39 - documentation and you can just read
13:42 - out if you want to check what is the
13:45 - shape of my turtle then simply you don't
13:49 - need to provide
13:50 - any parameter here just have to use this
13:54 - shape and see turtle and it will give
13:57 - you shape it is not printing because
14:00 - obviously you have to print
14:03 - this right what shape your turtle is
14:06 - having see it's Turtle right because we
14:10 - have changed the shape to Turtle if you
14:12 - don't change this to Turtle then by
14:14 - default if you want to print the shape
14:17 - then it's an arrow and it's classic
14:21 - classic
14:25 - right so if I change the shape to Arrow
14:27 - then what shape you will get
14:30 - it see this is Arrow shape it's
14:32 - something different from classic one
14:34 - right it's an arrow so if you move
14:39 - forward
14:41 - then obviously Turtle dot we have see
14:45 - this BK back or
14:49 - backward either now this time let's
14:51 - suppose we use
14:52 - BK and 100 or we can say
14:57 - 200 let let's run
15:00 - this see it has moved from Center first
15:04 - of all 100 in forward Direction then
15:07 - backward 200
15:09 - pixels right if you want to change the
15:13 - angle like I want to draw a we can say a
15:17 - square how you will draw so let's pause
15:20 - the video and try this out you have to
15:22 - draw a
15:23 - square let me just tell you first if you
15:27 - want to move the direction of that
15:30 - thing Turtle then there is one thing we
15:33 - have like turtle uh left and right we
15:36 - have two methods left and right so let
15:40 - me
15:41 - just rather than backward let me just
15:44 - use left suppose left and in left in
15:47 - bracket you have to give angle angle I'm
15:50 - just giving 90° or not 90 let's suppose
15:54 - give 45 it would be in degrees by
15:56 - default 45° let's run
16:00 - this see first it will move forward then
16:04 - it will change the angle to 45° as you
16:07 - can see it is tilted towards this
16:10 - direction 45°
16:12 - right if you want to
16:14 - move after
16:16 - that again in forward Direction then
16:21 - just again after uh you know doing the
16:24 - left again forward see 45° then forward
16:29 - like this if you want to move this to
16:33 - right direction then just rather than
16:35 - left you can just to write and just give
16:38 - angle rather than l f proper you can
16:41 - just write down short hand LT or RT if I
16:46 - after moving forward if I want to move
16:50 - the direction to right so RT and let's
16:54 - suppose give
16:56 - 45° and again
17:00 - move the direction move this forward 100
17:03 - pixels by 100 pixel
17:07 - see I hope you got this why you are
17:10 - getting this kind of line right so now
17:14 - pause the video and try to draw a
17:17 - square right so to draw a square first
17:21 - move forward 100 then first let's change
17:25 - the
17:26 - shape to
17:29 - Turtle to get a feel of using this you
17:32 - know Turtle Library so let's change the
17:35 - sh to Turtle then move forward 100 then
17:39 - turn left or right so I'm just moving
17:42 - this left to
17:44 - 90° then again move forward same side
17:48 - would be same for square 100 then I'm
17:51 - going to move this again
17:55 - left LT
17:57 - 90°
18:00 - I hope you have done this then again
18:03 - move 100 then
18:07 - again
18:11 - left 90° then again move
18:19 - 100 I
18:21 - hope it would draw a square let's run
18:23 - this I don't know
18:26 - see it's a square
18:28 - right or you can do it by like turn
18:31 - right then right then right then also
18:33 - this also you can do rather than turning
18:36 - it to left right now your assignment is
18:39 - you have to draw see we have done with
18:42 - square so now you have to draw
18:46 - triangle right
18:49 - plus uh you can say rectangle and
18:54 - pentagon or maybe you can do hexagon as
18:56 - well so these simple shapes this is is
18:58 - your assignment you have to try these
18:59 - out because in next video we'll be
19:01 - discussing more complex type of thing
19:04 - right and see I have told you to hold
19:07 - the screen like there are many methods
19:09 - exit on click or maybe we have one more
19:11 - thing that is one method is done so this
19:15 - also will do same thing either you can
19:17 - write down this done see let's run
19:22 - this
19:24 - right so now just or we have one more
19:27 - thing one that that is main Loop this
19:31 - method is also there so let's run
19:33 - this it will hold the screen right let's
19:37 - just click on this exit but whenever you
19:39 - click on the screen it will not exit
19:42 - exit on click if you use this method
19:45 - then only if you click on the screen
19:46 - then only it will exit if you using main
19:49 - Loop or done you have to close this
19:51 - right okay but one more thing I want to
19:53 - tell you it's not necessary to call this
19:55 - get screen method right if you don't
19:58 - call
19:59 - this your program will run fine
20:03 - see maybe you think now we are not
20:05 - calling the method get screen then how
20:07 - we are getting this screen so this
20:10 - screen would be automatically created
20:12 - you'll get the screen automatically
20:13 - whenever you call the method which are
20:15 - associated with the screen and some
20:18 - screen methods are see we have these
20:21 - some screen methods window methods of
20:24 - turtle screen or screen on python
20:26 - documentation you will get so all these
20:27 - are screen methods see method specific
20:31 - to screen it's buy exit on click setup
20:33 - title these kind of and we are calling
20:35 - these methods exit on click we have
20:37 - called that thing
20:39 - right but we have called that thing also
20:42 - main Loop or done these are also screen
20:45 - events right so whenever you call these
20:47 - thing like we have called main Loop so
20:49 - automatically it will give you screen if
20:52 - you call here
20:54 - exit on click then also defin
20:57 - automatically the screen would be there
20:59 - if you're not calling that get screen
21:00 - method right you click on the screen it
21:03 - will exit so no need to call the that
21:06 - method get screen separately right and
21:10 - maybe you are thinking somewhere in
21:11 - videos you will get like after importing
21:13 - turtle you have to create a turtle
21:15 - object like Turtle T is equal to you
21:18 - have to call a class in this module we
21:21 - have a class turtle and you have to
21:23 - create this one to get a turtle right
21:26 - but separately there is no need to
21:28 - create Turtle object if you run this
21:32 - see now we are
21:34 - getting two turtle one is turtle one is
21:37 - Arrow because one is by default the
21:40 - arrow here and another object we are
21:42 - creating Turtle object so we can see
21:44 - here by default you can see here we have
21:47 - two Turtle object right so this kind of
21:51 - thing this this is what we are calling
21:53 - Turtle class and we are creating the
21:55 - object so this is what object oriented
21:57 - approach we are using so this approach
21:58 - we use when obviously this is more
22:01 - powerful than the previous one we were
22:03 - using we are not creating any Turtle
22:04 - object or anything because by default we
22:06 - were getting one turtle and that's it
22:07 - for us but if you want to create more
22:09 - than one Turtle 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 many
22:12 - turtles on a particular screen on one
22:14 - screen only then then you have to create
22:18 - those Turtles
22:20 - separately Turtle objects you can say
22:22 - right so in that case you'll be using
22:25 - object oriented approach so from the
22:28 - next video we'll be using object
22:29 - oriented approach only right we will
22:32 - create a turtle because maybe we will be
22:34 - want two Turtle three Turtle more
22:36 - complex drawing or animation if you will
22:38 - do then maybe for that or maybe are you
22:41 - know creating any game then also maybe
22:43 - you are maybe you need need two turtle
22:46 - one turtle is running one turtle is
22:48 - chasing like another turtle like this
22:51 - specifically if like if you want more
22:53 - than one turtle on your screen then we
22:57 - will use use that object red approach
22:59 - right
23:00 - otherwise simply for the demo purpose
23:03 - there is no need to create any Turtle
23:05 - object by default an an unnamed Turtle
23:08 - object would be created whenever you
23:10 - call
23:11 - any any method related to turtle and
23:15 - that is like forward Left Right whenever
23:18 - you call these objects automatically you
23:21 - will get a turtle and that's I have
23:23 - shown
23:25 - you we are not creating any turtle and
23:27 - still we are getting Turtle because we
23:29 - are calling these methods which are
23:30 - specific to Turtle methods Turtle right
23:34 - and no need to get the screen
23:37 - separately many methods to get the
23:39 - screen we have a screen class also right
23:45 - so from that class we can create a
23:47 - screen object and then we will use that
23:50 - screen object so this is how we can
23:52 - create our screen object right with this
23:56 - screen class this is also Al fine this
23:58 - will also show you a screen
24:01 - right now rather than
24:06 - this we can just rather than Turtle dot
24:08 - this we can just use S1 screen object
24:12 - dot exit on
24:18 - click see this will also work fine so
24:20 - there are multiple ways to get the
24:21 - screen and anything like to get the
24:24 - turtle to get the screen to hold the
24:26 - screen so so you have to explore these
24:29 - things we cannot discuss everything in
24:32 - here video practically I can show you
24:34 - all the methods and everything just go
24:36 - to documentation and explore all the
24:38 - methods
24:39 - right if you want to control the speed
24:42 - of the turtle so then obviously we can
24:45 - control the speed of the turtle and what
24:47 - is the method Turtle dot let's just
24:50 - first delete this thing and I want to
24:52 - control the speed so speed and in speed
24:56 - how to give this thing so obviously
24:59 - there we have a speed method see here
25:02 - Turtle motion here we have speed method
25:04 - so speed you can give an integer in the
25:07 - range of 0 to 10 or you can give a speed
25:11 - string now speed string is this fastest
25:14 - fast normal slow slowest so zero means
25:17 - fastest means if you give zero means
25:20 - there is no animation takes place mean
25:22 - that is fast test you cannot even see
25:24 - the moment right one three means slow
25:28 - six normal and 10 is
25:30 - fast right so you have to give between 0
25:33 - to 10 if you give a number greater than
25:35 - 10 or smaller than 0.5 then speed would
25:38 - be Auto automatically set to zero right
25:41 - and these are the speed string rather
25:42 - than the integer you can give you can
25:44 - write down fastest fast normal slow
25:46 - slowest right so I'm just writing the
25:48 - speed
25:51 - one see as you can see the
25:55 - difference right
25:59 - okay S one is not defined so for here we
26:01 - have to
26:03 - use Turtle do exit on
26:06 - click
26:08 - see now it's
26:11 - slowest right we can also change the
26:14 - color but that thing we'll see next
26:17 - video how to change the pen color how to
26:20 - fill the color in that image and all
26:24 - right how to draw a circle okay let's
26:25 - draw a circle now
26:28 - we have a um method directly here
26:34 - Circle
26:35 - see
26:38 - Circle right so just give the radius
26:41 - here so radius is suppose 100 let's run
26:48 - this
26:54 - see because first we were writing here
27:00 - this thing speed one then forward left
27:03 - so four it will obviously one by one
27:07 - execute all the commands so it will
27:08 - create a square first then it will print
27:10 - the shape then it will print
27:13 - Circle so see as you can see
27:16 - after just printing the the square
27:19 - simply it will draw the circle taking a
27:22 - radius of 100 see this
27:25 - this distance is 100 so this is what you
27:28 - can say radius 100 and it will draw a
27:33 - circle right because we have move this
27:36 - this we have moved this Turtle for over
27:38 - 200 pixels so definitely it is we can
27:40 - say it is 100 and the circle radiuses we
27:43 - have given 100 so definitely this is
27:45 - radius of the circle and it is circle so
27:47 - this is how you can play with your game
27:50 - and you can you know draw different
27:51 - different kind of images and all or
27:54 - shapes so more about total Graphics we
27:57 - we will see next video right and there
28:00 - this is the simplest one we haven't used
28:02 - any object oriented approach we haven't
28:04 - created any Turtle object by default the
28:06 - turtle object was created only one
28:08 - object and the unnamed Turtle object and
28:10 - that we were using so in the next video
28:12 - from the next video we'll be using that
28:14 - object oriented approach we'll create
28:16 - we'll use the classes and objects we'll
28:18 - create Turtle object screen object and
28:20 - how to change the color and everything
28:22 - we'll be seeing animations and all right
28:25 - so now I'll see you in the next Tut then
28:26 - bye-bye it
