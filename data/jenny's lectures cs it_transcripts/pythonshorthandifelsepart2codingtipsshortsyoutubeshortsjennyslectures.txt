00:00 - so we have seen shorthand effects but
00:02 - there are some more points you need to
00:03 - remember when you are using shorthand if
00:05 - else see this is the example we have
00:08 - taken even and code number you have to
00:10 - find out so in shorthand if else we can
00:12 - write down this thing first of all if
00:13 - clock statement then if the condition
00:15 - then else then else clock statement but
00:18 - you can use this shorthand if else if
00:20 - you have only one executable statement
00:22 - within this if and within this it's only
00:24 - one if this is the case something like
00:26 - this so I want to statement in this if
00:28 - flow so let's run this A6 so if you
00:30 - print even number and grade these two
00:32 - statement but if you want to write down
00:34 - this in terms of short and then how you
00:36 - will write first of all you will write
00:38 - if if Loop statement so there are two
00:40 - statements so we write print even number
00:41 - print great then if then condition then
00:44 - else but here it will give an error
00:45 - let's run this and I'll show you see
00:47 - syntax error this is invalid syntax only
00:49 - one statement you can print only one
00:52 - statement you can print here it should
00:53 - be one statement then you can use
00:55 - shorthand if else to write down this
00:57 - case so that's the next video till then
00:58 - bye take care
