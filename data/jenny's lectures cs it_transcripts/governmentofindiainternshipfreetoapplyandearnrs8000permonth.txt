00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in this video I'll be
00:04 - talking about one government of India
00:05 - internship that you you can go for and
00:08 - which is a Nao internship Nao stands for
00:11 - National AIDS control organization and
00:14 - this internship is offered by Ministry
00:16 - of Health and Family welfare right now
00:19 - maybe you are thinking that if you are
00:20 - from CS or IT background and you want to
00:22 - go in that AI field tech field or maybe
00:24 - financi field then this is of no use for
00:26 - you guys right so maybe you are thinking
00:28 - like this technically you are right
00:31 - right but if you go for this then
00:33 - definitely it will add value to your
00:35 - resume right because many students don't
00:37 - do it those who want to go in those
00:39 - field tech field or these field they
00:40 - don't go in you know they are not
00:43 - interested in other aspects or in other
00:45 - fields they just want to go go for
00:48 - internship in that field also yeah that
00:49 - is also fine but if you have time if you
00:52 - are interested if you can dedicate if
00:55 - you can you can work for some extra
00:57 - hours then go for some other internships
01:00 - also if you add these kind of government
01:03 - of India internship in your resume then
01:04 - defin definitely it will add value to
01:06 - your resume right and they think that
01:08 - the interviewer or they think that yes
01:11 - you are interested or you have
01:13 - experienced of some working in some
01:15 - other fields also right and they want to
01:18 - know sometimes you know they want to
01:20 - know more about these fields or about
01:22 - you so you know you will get some Edge
01:27 - over other candidates in this case right
01:29 - so so I would recommend if you have time
01:31 - if you are interested in these things
01:33 - also so go for it so now when you can
01:35 - apply for the the this internship the
01:38 - enrollments are open throughout the year
01:39 - so anytime you can apply for this
01:41 - internship right but in one year in One
01:43 - Financial year you can apply only once
01:46 - it's not like that you applied in June
01:47 - also in August also in December also no
01:51 - it's not like that in one year you can
01:52 - apply only once and what interns are
01:55 - supposed to do you know they are
01:57 - supposed to observe the functioning of
01:59 - different region in those Health
02:01 - departments sometimes write reports
02:04 - doing data analysis research and also
02:07 - whatever activities they are assigned to
02:09 - you you have to do those activities
02:11 - sometimes you have to undertake field
02:13 - work also so I think this would be quite
02:15 - interesting for you guys now what is the
02:18 - eligibility criteria anyone like it's
02:21 - like open for all students who are going
02:24 - for who are doing undergraduate graduate
