00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language we are
00:04 - discussing some coding exercises using
00:07 - dtal Graphics in python in the previous
00:09 - video we have seen how to generate a
00:11 - random work of the turtle with different
00:14 - different colors randomly chosen colors
00:16 - right according to RGB value now in this
00:19 - video we'll see two more exercises two
00:22 - more shapes we are going to draw right
00:25 - so the first one is let me show you see
00:28 - I hope you have seen this uh star when
00:30 - you go to that python Turtle
00:33 - documentation this page then we have
00:35 - this Turtle Star
00:38 - right so we will draw this star first
00:41 - this Turtle star so as you can see here
00:45 - see the pen color is the boundary is pen
00:48 - color is red but inside the filling
00:51 - color is yellow so two colors you need
00:54 - red pen color and filling color is
00:56 - yellow right now how to draw this thing
01:00 - saying obviously the at first Circle or
01:04 - sorry the turtle would be at the center
01:05 - of our screen like this then it will
01:09 - move something like this then how this
01:11 - star would be drawn and when to stop the
01:13 - circle you have to decide these things
01:16 - mean particularly you can say uh you can
01:18 - take the distance 100 like the edge of
01:24 - this star this something like this this
01:27 - would be 100 right now you have to the
01:30 - side after moving 100 like forward at
01:34 - what angle it is going
01:35 - to move the
01:37 - head right at what angle and then when
01:41 - to stop these two things you have to
01:43 - decide the stopping condition and the
01:46 - angle right so pause the video and try
01:49 - this out it's very simple so I hope you
01:51 - have done this let's try this let's
01:54 - create a new file in that Turtle project
01:56 - turtle star.
01:58 - py and and here same thing we will do
02:02 - like from so same first we are going to
02:06 - import the turtle class as well as we
02:10 - can import let's see screen class if you
02:12 - want and let's create a turtle Tom is
02:17 - equal to Turtle just a turtle name any
02:21 - name you can take it's not like that you
02:22 - have to take Tom only x y z a BC and the
02:24 - name of the class is turtle with capital
02:26 - T and then this brackets so this is a
02:30 - object and to hold the screen we will
02:33 - use let's take first let's create a
02:36 - screen as
02:38 - well in the previous ones we haven't
02:41 - created a separate screen but let's try
02:44 - this out this is also fine with a screen
02:47 - class let's create a screen S1 right and
02:50 - at last you just have to decide I mean
02:54 - to hold the screen so once I click on
02:57 - that particular screen then it will it
02:59 - should disappear so S1 dot we have many
03:02 - method like one is exit on click so S1
03:04 - dot exit on click right okay that's it
03:08 - now you have to draw the star so let's
03:11 - take the color first Tom dot we have a
03:14 - method we know color and two argument we
03:18 - can give
03:19 - here one also two also this thing we
03:22 - have we discussed when discussing the
03:25 - methods pen color fill color uh begin
03:28 - color end color sorry begin fill end
03:31 - fill in that we have like pen color fill
03:33 - color and as well as color simpol so
03:35 - first argument is pen color that's red
03:39 - second would be considered as fill color
03:42 - that is
03:44 - yellow okay that's fine so Tom do color
03:48 - is
03:49 - this right now you have
03:53 - to move how to draw this this star if my
03:58 - like this is my my screen and here in
04:01 - the center I have my turtle so I'm going
04:03 - to move the turtle to 100 pixels right
04:08 - then
04:09 - let's how to create this
04:12 - one like
04:14 - this then
04:16 - again like this then again like
04:21 - this right I hope you are
04:23 - getting okay my drawing is not so good
04:27 - so but but you
04:28 - are I hope you are able to get how to
04:31 - dra this thing like this so you have to
04:34 - decide the
04:36 - angle and when to stop that thing also
04:40 - you have to decide like this right and
04:43 - it is going to continue till the
04:45 - stopping exit condition met uh stopping
04:49 - condition so see if we move first like
04:54 - this and then we are moving like this so
04:58 - this is the angle
05:00 - this is the
05:02 - angle this this angle is what if you
05:05 - move something like this that that is
05:07 - 90° but it's not 90 in between it's
05:11 - again 90 + 45 but that is 135 but more
05:15 - than 135 so let's take it to you can say
05:18 - around
05:20 - 170
05:22 - right you can take different different
05:24 - angles according to that you can just
05:26 - draw the shape and then you will get the
05:28 - exact idea the angle is what
05:32 - fine so first let's move this Turtle
05:35 - forward to 100 pixels then just move
05:40 - this Turtle to left
05:44 - left Tom dot
05:51 - left let's take
05:55 - 170 or if you don't take 170 let's take
05:58 - it 160
06:00 - maybe you think why 170 let's take it
06:03 - 160 because it's more than
06:05 - 135 right so around 160 we are going to
06:09 - take but
06:11 - then with no
06:13 - indentation right but then obviously
06:16 - these two steps should be repeated so
06:19 - this should be in for Loop if you run
06:22 - this
06:23 - thing then that's it one line 100 then
06:30 - after tilting the head to 160 that's it
06:34 - now again you have to move to 100 then
06:38 - again tilt then again move like this so
06:41 - these two lines we
06:43 - going is going to be repeated so let's
06:47 - take a four Loop or we can we cannot
06:50 - take four Loop because four Loop we will
06:52 - take four Loop when we know the exact
06:54 - number of iteration but we don't know
06:55 - the exact number of
06:57 - iteration right
07:00 - suppose you know exact number of
07:01 - iteration and you you think that in
07:07 - range let's make it
07:09 - 50 and let's see so these two lines
07:13 - should be indented within this whole
07:16 - Loop right okay let's run
07:19 - this see what is happening
07:24 - now so
07:27 - now that's it it is drawing again and
07:30 - again on the same path it is going on
07:33 - the same star on the same
07:37 - line right but obviously there is no
07:40 - point to move this thing again and again
07:43 - on the same till 50 so we don't know
07:44 - exactly the number of iteration right so
07:47 - what should be the stopping condition we
07:50 - can decide that thing like if I'm moving
07:54 - something like this and once I be back
07:56 - on this point then stop the starting
08:00 - point so how to put this condition so at
08:06 - starting point we can check the heading
08:08 - of the
08:10 - turtle so let's check this thing at
08:14 - starting if I
08:16 - print Tom dot
08:20 - heading let's make it
08:25 - 170 because 160 it's more than 160 from
08:29 - that image from that star I hope you
08:32 - have figured it out the angle was more
08:33 - than 160 let's move this to not 100 it's
08:39 - 200 and let's print the heading as
08:42 - well see now the heading
08:47 - is
08:48 - 0.0 right okay let's see what is
08:51 - happening here so this is the star this
08:54 - is something like that Turtle
08:57 - Star right that that we have seen we
09:00 - have to
09:02 - draw but now see again now at this point
09:07 - of time it is moving again and again on
09:08 - the same line on the same line why so
09:11 - because you have given exact number of
09:14 - iteration 50 but we don't want the exact
09:17 - number of iteration right so when to
09:20 - stop see we have
09:22 - a method here heading you can check to
09:26 - this uh you can say python documentation
09:30 - Turtle Lo heading see Returns the turtle
09:34 - current heading value depends on Turtle
09:35 - mode actually so if the turtle is we
09:40 - have moved we have tilted the turtle
09:42 - head to left 67° then heading would be
09:45 - 67 right so if turtle is straight then
09:49 - heading would be obviously zero so at
09:51 - exactly at this point of time the
09:53 - heading what was Zero let me just show
09:55 - you again
09:57 - see the heading is zero so we can put
10:00 - some condition rather than this rather
10:03 - than this let's stop
10:05 - this just put y Loop because if you
10:08 - don't know the number of iteration then
10:10 - just we use while loop while trip and we
10:14 - just put in the Y Loop the stopping
10:16 - condition if the heading ter do
10:21 - heading is equal to is equal to Z again
10:25 - then out of the loop means break for
10:28 - that also we have a keyword break just
10:30 - use
10:32 - that right so no need to print this
10:35 - heading now because that was we want to
10:38 - know exactly at first The Heading
10:40 - position was so again if the heading
10:42 - position reached to zero then just stop
10:45 - right and if I draw here one if I again
10:48 - write the angle 160 then see what is
10:51 - happening see this is the star but this
10:55 - is not exactly what we want and see once
10:58 - the
10:59 - turtle is again here stop right okay now
11:04 - what about fill
11:05 - color you have to fill the color also
11:08 - yellow right so for that obviously we
11:12 - have to fill any shape first you have to
11:15 - use begin fill end fill so at first to
11:18 - dot begin fill after that while loop and
11:21 - draw that shape and after while
11:25 - loop to Dot and fill the turtle object
11:30 - do end fi let's run this and this time
11:33 - it will show you but yeah obviously you
11:35 - have to change the angle it should be
11:36 - more than 160 right if I take it
11:43 - 165 so you can take this thing different
11:47 - different angle you can take and you can
11:48 - check out the shapes but exact if you
11:51 - want this Turtle star that was in Python
11:54 - documentation then I am going to tell
11:56 - you the angle is 170 exact angle is 1
11:59 - 170 here also you can see the angle is
12:03 - 170 on this documentation also you can
12:05 - see somewhere see angle is
12:09 - 170
12:13 - right so angle is 170 like this right if
12:18 - you want to change the turtle shape or
12:22 - you want to hide the turtle just do that
12:23 - thing if you want to change the speed of
12:26 - the turtle you can do that thing you can
12:27 - play with this game and
12:29 - I mean play with this code
12:32 - and you will be ending with different
12:34 - different shapes I guess right okay this
12:39 - is the one shape now second shape is
12:41 - okay so this is our second shape see
12:46 - there are circles
12:49 - right and circle circle circle we
12:52 - repeating the circle
12:54 - but first Circle then till tilt the head
12:59 - of the turtle to some point then again a
13:04 - circle then the
13:06 - tilting uh angle is sh same then again
13:10 - at the same angle tilt the head then one
13:12 - more Circle one more circle like this
13:14 - like this like this spiral type right
13:18 - and when it is going to end at last it
13:21 - will reach to the original Circle then
13:23 - it is going to
13:24 - end fine but one more thing here every
13:28 - time for the the circle every time
13:30 - almost every time the color is different
13:34 - right so you have to implement that
13:36 - concept also random color you have to
13:39 - choose that also we have seen in
13:40 - previous video according to RGB values
13:42 - in the tle in pen color you have to give
13:45 - RGB values in the range of zero to color
13:48 - mode right and color mode is either 1 or
13:51 - you can say 255 if you set color mode
13:53 - zero then RGB value would be from 0 to Z
13:57 - and that would be black
13:59 - every time the color would be black so
14:01 - no point to set the color mode to zero
14:04 - either you can set to one or 255 if you
14:07 - set to one then also 0 to one RGB value
14:10 - would be 0 to one like in decimal point
14:11 - 0.1 0.2 like like this something like
14:14 - this right that is also fine but
14:17 - generally we take color mod to
14:19 - 255 right as you can go to the TK color
14:22 - specification and there also you will
14:24 - see I have shown you this thing this
14:26 - thing many time you can search P
14:28 - specific
14:29 - and because the method pen color and all
14:33 - take the color from the Stik color
14:35 - specification so see RGB value is
14:38 - something like this
14:39 - in uh not in floating point value some
14:42 - integer value
14:44 - right so these are color and these are
14:46 - RGB values so you have to generate these
14:49 - RGB value differently according to that
14:51 - color would be generated
14:54 - right see now we are done at last when
14:58 - we read reach to the original Circle
15:02 - stop so here also 2 to three concept you
15:05 - have
15:06 - to implement first draw a circle then
15:10 - the angle you have to find out or how
15:12 - you are going to move that Circle or the
15:15 - Tilt the turtle I don't know you have to
15:18 - find out then random color you have to
15:20 - choose and then stopping condition you
15:22 - have to add these three or four things
15:23 - you have to do right so pause the video
15:25 - and try this out so I hope you have done
15:27 - this
15:29 - let's just comment out these things and
15:32 - okay this thing we
15:34 - want first three lines right again let's
15:38 - copy paste these things and will will
15:41 - remove these comments
15:44 - right and one more thing at last also we
15:47 - want S1 do exit on click this thing also
15:50 - we want right now you have to write down
15:53 - the logic here in
15:55 - between so same stopping condition we
15:58 - can take
16:03 - see if I draw a circle something like
16:06 - this if my turtle is here right so first
16:11 - draw a circle something like this okay
16:13 - it's not a circle but let's assume it's
16:14 - a circle right then tilt the head of the
16:19 - circle to some angle and again a circle
16:22 - would be from here something like
16:26 - this right
16:29 - and again to same distance Circle will
16:32 - be something like this and when you have
16:34 - to stop when again we reach to the
16:39 - original the first Circle so same
16:43 - stopping condition we can put like
16:44 - heading at first heading was zero so you
16:46 - can check if the heading is again
16:47 - reached to zero then
16:49 - stop fine but the angle is what so this
16:53 - angle is like if this this is the line X
16:57 - XIs and Y y AIS this is something the
17:00 - line
17:01 - right so this was our first Circle so we
17:06 - are just it angle is just like maybe 5°
17:10 - or something like this 5 6° so first
17:13 - let's draw the circle to dot we have
17:16 - Circle and just
17:18 - uh we going to take the radius 100 then
17:23 - move to
17:25 - left with 5° small angle will take as
17:29 - you can see from that shape only it's
17:31 - very small
17:33 - angle or if you take more angle like
17:35 - maybe if you take 10° then also I'll
17:38 - show you you can check out this thing
17:39 - I'm taking just five you can just check
17:42 - different
17:42 - different angles but these things should
17:46 - be repeated these two things and when to
17:48 - stop that also we know
17:51 - so while while loop is best to use in
17:54 - this case because we don't know exactly
17:56 - the number of iterations right
17:59 - so just this should be indented and if
18:04 - stopping condition is same if the this
18:08 - heading equal to equal to zero again
18:11 - then just break from the loop out of the
18:13 - loop just break right but one
18:17 - thing we are still left with like the
18:19 - RGB color right because every time this
18:22 - time this this would be color would be
18:25 - black only see this is black only
18:29 - right right yeah
18:31 - obviously so for color also we have done
18:34 - that concept RGB value every time
18:37 - obviously in for Loop we will or you can
18:39 - make a separate function also every time
18:42 - just uh generate the RGB value so R is
18:45 - equal to randomly you have to generate
18:48 - So Random dot we have a function in
18:49 - random module that is Rand
18:53 - end and the value would be from 0 to
18:57 - 255 the the color mode zero to color
18:59 - mode so color mode I'm setting 255 so
19:01 - first you have to set the color mode
19:03 - here color mode of turtle not for Tom
19:07 - right see after creating Tom if I write
19:10 - Tom do color
19:12 - mode there's no color mode method here
19:15 - for the object it's for turtle so you
19:19 - have to set for turtle dot color
19:24 - mode is 255 this thing you need to take
19:28 - care
19:29 - so it's Auto automatically see import
19:30 - random import Turtle this thing you have
19:32 - to do because by using this line we
19:34 - haven't imported this
19:36 - Turtle we have just imported from this
19:38 - Turtle module Turtle class and screen so
19:41 - you have to import this Turtle module as
19:43 - well to use this line Turtle color mode
19:46 - right so R is this same for G and
19:49 - B so this thing this RGB value would be
19:53 - randomly from within 0 to
19:55 - 255 right so just set the the pen color
19:59 - before drawing the circle so Tom do pen
20:04 - color and here as a tle just provide r g
20:09 - b value this thing in detail we have
20:11 - discussed in previous
20:13 - video random kind of thing and how to
20:16 - generate the random RGB value random
20:18 - color according to RGB value right so
20:21 - like this let's run this and see what is
20:24 - happening
20:25 - here see now the
20:29 - turtle color is different different
20:31 - every time it is choosing the color from
20:33 - that according to RGB value right and
20:37 - let's make it fastest let's increase the
20:41 - speed of this storm do
20:44 - speed is
20:47 - fastest or you can write down here zero
20:49 - is also fastest and 10 is also fastest
20:52 - zero means no animation so let's run
20:55 - this now
20:56 - see it will look something like this and
20:59 - stop once original position it will lead
21:02 - to the original Circle just
21:05 - stop right so these kind of shapes also
21:08 - we can draw with these Turtle Graphics
21:12 - so you can play around with this code
21:14 - changing the angle or changing the speed
21:16 - or other thing also you can change
21:19 - rather than Circle you can draw
21:20 - something else it's up to you right
21:24 - different different
21:25 - shapes so next in next video we'll do a
21:28 - project using Turtle Graphics right so
21:31 - now I'll see you in the next till then
21:32 - bye-bye take care
