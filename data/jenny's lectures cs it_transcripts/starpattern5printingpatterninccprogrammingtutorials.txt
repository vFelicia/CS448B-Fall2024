00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:02 - c we are discussing printing pattern
00:04 - programs and
00:04 - see in this video i'll talk about how to
00:06 - print this pattern first
00:08 - first of all you will see the logic on
00:09 - this whiteboard then what i'll show the
00:11 - output on my laptop
00:13 - right now first thing when you see any
00:15 - printing pattern program is what you
00:16 - have to analyze it
00:17 - like how many number of rows number of
00:19 - columns and everything so first of all
00:21 - what you will do
00:22 - better to divide it like in rows and
00:25 - columns
00:26 - you will get it better right
00:30 - in this case how many rows five rows are
00:32 - there right
00:33 - and the loop which will handle the rows
00:36 - one loop would be to handle the rows
00:38 - that is
00:39 - the variable is i for this row i value
00:41 - is one
00:42 - two 3 4 and 5 for columns we have
00:45 - another loop having variable
00:47 - j and
00:51 - these are the columns right we have
00:53 - number these columns
00:54 - now first loop will be
00:58 - responsible for rows second loop will be
01:00 - would be responsible to print these
01:03 - uh stars actual stars right and third
01:06 - loop
01:07 - would be responsible to print space see
01:10 - before first star in the first line we
01:13 - have how many spaces
01:15 - four spaces one two three four
01:18 - in second line three here we have two
01:21 - spaces here we have one space and here
01:23 - we have zero space
01:24 - right it's not space right
01:28 - from here uh the pattern we're going to
01:31 - start
01:32 - like the pattern so that is why space
01:35 - from this
01:36 - before the star is one two three four
01:39 - it's not
01:40 - space right this is known as leading
01:43 - space
01:43 - and this space is known as trailing
01:46 - space we don't have to print the
01:47 - trailing space
01:48 - we just have to take care about the the
01:51 - leading space
01:52 - right so one loop would be to print
01:54 - these spaces
01:55 - one would be responsible to print the
01:57 - stars and one would be responsible
01:59 - to take care of these lines number of
02:01 - rows three loops
02:03 - would be required so now what would be
02:06 - the logic
02:07 - first loop simply the outer loop would
02:09 - be from
02:10 - i is equal to 1 to less than equal to 5
02:13 - and i plus plus that's it
02:17 - because lines are 1 to 5
02:20 - 5 rows we have fine
02:23 - now for space see in the previous
02:27 - video also we have discussed let me just
02:30 - draw the condition
02:32 - when i value is one how many spaces
02:35 - four when i value is two how many spaces
02:38 - three when i value is three two spaces
02:41 - when i value is four
02:42 - one space and i value is five zero space
02:46 - now what condition
02:50 - you will put for this loop the loop
02:52 - which would be
02:54 - running for the space i am taking the
02:56 - variable space only
02:57 - right no i j k or anything
03:00 - space is equal to 1 now what should be
03:03 - the condition
03:04 - condition space less than equal to
03:08 - c when i value is 1 space
03:12 - should be 4 means in first row space
03:14 - should be 4 and after that it's
03:16 - decreasing
03:17 - right so what you can put see number of
03:19 - lines are 5
03:20 - total number of lines 5. if we subtract
03:23 - this
03:24 - row number from the total number of
03:26 - lines then we will get it
03:28 - means what we can put number of rows
03:30 - minus
03:31 - i number of rows are total number of
03:34 - rows five
03:35 - minus for for the first line i value is
03:37 - one so you will get
03:38 - four for second line i value is two
03:42 - you will get three for third line i
03:44 - value is three
03:46 - five minus three you will get two for
03:47 - fifth line i
03:49 - value is four that is one and four fifth
03:51 - five minus five zero
03:53 - it's working so what condition you will
03:55 - you can put here
03:57 - space is equal to number of rows minus
04:01 - i right
04:04 - and we do not have space here so i am
04:07 - writing here
04:08 - space plus plus and within this
04:11 - loop we are going to print only space
04:15 - now third loop would be responsible to
04:18 - print these
04:19 - stars right here i am taking number of
04:22 - rows here i am taking what
04:23 - five rows so you can if you print this
04:26 - pattern only you can write 5 minus
04:28 - i that is you can do but if you want the
04:30 - user
04:31 - should enter number of rows you want to
04:33 - print like one time 5
04:34 - another time when you run then 10 then
04:36 - 15 and 20 like this
04:37 - then you can take one a simple variable
04:40 - and you can enter you can ask the user
04:43 - ask from the user to enter ah the number
04:46 - of rows
04:46 - he or she want to print so before that
04:49 - you can
04:50 - just take the value of this variable
04:54 - rows
04:56 - using printf and scan see here i'm not
04:58 - writing the complete code i'm just
05:00 - writing the logic here the complete code
05:02 - i'll show you on my laptop
05:03 - before using the psi space and rows you
05:06 - have to declare these variables right
05:08 - so that is why here also we are not
05:10 - doing any hard coding
05:12 - right so we are not taking 5 we can
05:15 - put here i less than equal to
05:18 - rows whatever number of rows user want
05:20 - to enter till then the outer loop should
05:22 - run
05:23 - right and i plus plus now
05:26 - for space sorry for space we have draw
05:29 - we have drawn the condition now for star
05:31 - what condition you will put c
05:33 - when i value is one only one star
05:36 - when i went is 2 3 star when in third
05:40 - line
05:40 - 5 star here 7 star and here 9 star
05:45 - so what relation you can get you have
05:48 - when you are trying to find out
05:49 - the relation what you have you have only
05:52 - i variable
05:53 - number of rows j variable here we have
05:56 - space
05:58 - or we have total number of rows three or
06:00 - four variables generally you will have
06:02 - so you have to do something with these
06:04 - variables only
06:05 - either multiplication division or minus
06:07 - or plus
06:09 - and you have to find out the condition
06:10 - you have to think like this
06:12 - so using these variables i j and space
06:15 - and rows
06:16 - how you can draw the condition for
06:18 - printing this star
06:21 - see for i
06:24 - one and one i think you can observe the
06:27 - the that pattern here if i do
06:30 - 2 into i like 2 into i
06:35 - for this 2 2 into i
06:38 - 4 but here we have 3 2 into y 6 but here
06:41 - we have 5
06:43 - so what you can do 2 into i minus 1
06:47 - see the condition would be 2 into i
06:50 - minus 1
06:52 - so for the first row 2 into 1 minus 1
06:55 - that is you will get 1
06:56 - for second row 2 into i value is 2 minus
06:59 - 1
07:00 - 4 minus 1 that 3 you will get for third
07:03 - 2 into 3 minus 1 that is 5 you will get
07:07 - right and like this
07:14 - i hope you can relate this thing you can
07:16 - now find out the condition
07:18 - so this should be the condition for
07:20 - printing the stack so what you can write
07:21 - here
07:23 - for printing star for the third loop i
07:25 - am taking a variable j
07:26 - j is equal to 1 and j should be less
07:28 - than equal to 2
07:30 - into i minus 1
07:34 - and j plus plus
07:37 - right and within this for loop what you
07:40 - can print simply
07:42 - star no space after star like in
07:45 - previous video
07:47 - and in outer loop what you have to print
07:49 - slash n
07:52 - and that's it right now
07:55 - just see the working of uh this program
07:59 - see it will ask from the user first of
08:01 - all enter number of rows
08:03 - suppose i'm entering number of rows five
08:05 - so now i
08:06 - is equal to one first of all i would be
08:08 - initialized with one
08:09 - one less than equal to five yes
08:11 - condition tree we will enter into the
08:13 - slope
08:14 - now space would be initialized with one
08:18 - space is one less than equal to now rows
08:20 - minus five
08:21 - rows are five five minus i i value is
08:24 - one that is four yes condition true we
08:26 - will enter here and
08:28 - space would be printed now space plus
08:30 - plus that is two
08:32 - now two less than four yes condition
08:34 - true again space would be printed now
08:36 - space plus plus three now three less
08:38 - than four yes again space would be
08:39 - printed
08:40 - now 4 yes 4 less than 4 again spam space
08:44 - would be printed
08:45 - now 5 is 5 less than equal to 4
08:48 - no out of this loop after this loop we
08:51 - have another loop
08:52 - so now j would be initialized with 1 j
08:55 - less than
08:56 - equal to this 1 less than equal to now 2
08:58 - into i i value is 1
09:00 - 2 2 into i minus 1 that would be 2 into
09:03 - 1 minus 1 that is
09:04 - 1 1 less than equal to 1 yes condition
09:06 - true now we will
09:08 - enter here and now star should be
09:09 - printed
09:11 - right j plus plus j is 2 2 less than
09:14 - equal to 1 no condition is not true
09:16 - exit from this loop we have slash n now
09:18 - control would be
09:20 - in the next line now i plus plus
09:24 - check the condition again 2 less than
09:25 - equal to 5 yes condition true again
09:28 - enter into this loop now again space
09:30 - would be initialized with
09:32 - 1 right sorry
09:36 - now 1 less than equal to number of rows
09:39 - are 5
09:40 - minus now i value is 2 5 minus 2 that is
09:44 - 3
09:44 - now here we have 3
09:48 - right yes condition true space should be
09:50 - printed
09:52 - space plus plus two again condition true
09:54 - space would be printed
09:56 - space plus plus three again condition
09:58 - true space would be printed
10:00 - space plus plus four condition is not
10:02 - true exit from the loop
10:04 - now again j would be initialized with 1
10:07 - now again check 1 less than equal to 2
10:10 - into i minus 1 now calculate 2 into i i
10:12 - value is now 2
10:13 - 2 into 2 4 minus 1 that is 3
10:17 - right yes condition true star would be
10:19 - printed
10:21 - j plus plus j is two now two less than
10:24 - equal to two three yes condition true
10:25 - again star will be printed
10:27 - j plus plus three three less than equal
10:29 - to three three yes condition true again
10:31 - star will be printed
10:33 - j4 now condition is not true now exit
10:36 - from this
10:36 - and slashing now in x plan
10:40 - right i hope now no need to dry run the
10:43 - complete
10:43 - program right i mean till what
10:47 - i value would be 3 then 4 then 5
10:50 - till then this pattern will be printed
10:52 - when i value becomes 6
10:54 - 6 less than equal to number of rows 5
10:56 - condition is not real exit from the loop
10:58 - i hope no need to dry run the complete
11:00 - code you got it right you can dry run
11:03 - these three lines you can dry run
11:05 - yourself
11:06 - fine now let me show you the output so
11:09 - now let me create another
11:10 - file for this named pattern
11:14 - 8 dot c right
11:21 - first of all header files
11:24 - then we will write the main function and
11:28 - we declare the variables we use
11:31 - during our program okay
11:35 - 4 now the first loop
11:38 - outer loop would be 4 number of
11:42 - rows total number of rows so i less than
11:44 - equal to
11:45 - number of rows but before that you just
11:48 - have to take the input from the user
11:54 - right
12:01 - so now before that we will ask from the
12:03 - user number of rows
12:05 - using printf and scan
12:33 - and now within this formula we'll print
12:35 - will
12:37 - take what another for loop
12:40 - this is for space space is equal to 1
12:43 - and
12:45 - space should be less than equal to what
12:46 - is the condition
12:48 - rows minus i right
12:53 - and space plus plus
12:57 - now here what will print
13:02 - space only and that's it for this
13:05 - now another for loop
13:09 - j is equal to 1 that is to print star
13:11 - and j less than equal to what condition
13:13 - we will put
13:14 - 2 into i minus
13:17 - 1 right and now j
13:20 - plus plus and within this
13:24 - will print star
13:31 - and now again in the outer loop we'll
13:33 - print what one more thing that is
13:36 - slashing now let me run this program
13:46 - see it is asking number of rows you want
13:47 - to print let me enter five
13:50 - and yeah exactly this pattern you want
13:52 - let me run this for number of rows uh
13:54 - 10 and that's it
13:58 - right this is the output you want right
14:00 - the full parameter
14:01 - so i hope you got how to print this
14:03 - pattern that's it for this video now
14:04 - i'll see you in the next video with a
14:06 - new pattern till then bye bye
14:07 - take
