00:00 - so in the series of learning programming
00:01 - in c we are discussing 2D arrays in C we
00:03 - have discussed like everything about 2D
00:05 - arrays reason why we are using 2D arrays
00:08 - declaration initialization memory
00:09 - representation and how to access 2D
00:11 - arrays so now we will discuss some two
00:13 - or three programs about 2D arrays right
00:16 - basically 2D arrays uh are used to what
00:19 - to you know uh do some operations on
00:23 - metrics so you can also write like 2D as
00:26 - a matrix you can also you know consider
00:28 - it something like this so in this video
00:29 - I'll disc first of all a simple program
00:31 - we'll take or you can say we will read a
00:34 - 2d array or a matrix you can say then
00:36 - we'll print that 2D array and then also
00:39 - we calculate sum of all the elements
00:41 - whatever you will enter in that Matrix
00:43 - or in that 2D array right first of all
00:46 - we'll see the logic here on the
00:47 - Whiteboard then we'll do practical also
00:50 - I'll show you the output on my laptop
00:51 - right let's discuss the logic to print a
00:54 - 2d array first of all we will read a 2d
00:56 - array right so like this I'm de laring
01:00 - suppose a 2d aray like in a and 2 and
01:04 - 3 only a small 2D bring here you can
01:07 - take three four or any size right and
01:10 - for entering we will use obviously what
01:13 - four Loops two four Loops so I'm going
01:15 - to declare two variables for using the
01:18 - those four Loops so first read a 2d
01:21 - array using two for Loops one for row
01:24 - like this we are going to represent this
01:28 - one
01:32 - row 0 1 index 0 1 2 these are columns
01:35 - right two and three two rows and three
01:37 - colums this is a column size right so
01:40 - now first Loop would be what I Loop
01:43 - would be to read rows how many rows are
01:47 - there but now Within These rows also we
01:50 - are having columns so this this J Loop
01:52 - would read the actual values right of
01:56 - these columns so two Loops would be
01:58 - required that is next Loops would be
02:00 - required here I = to 0 I less than this
02:04 - is for row and row size is 2 so I less
02:06 - than 2 it should run for two uh two
02:10 - times only with than this the loop would
02:13 - be for column J is zero J less than how
02:16 - many columns three so less than three
02:19 - and j++ three times it would run right
02:22 - and how to read data using scanner
02:25 - function percentage D and address of a
02:28 - of I and G
02:32 - this is how we can read data that that
02:34 - sentex we have already discussed in my
02:36 - previous videos right scan of synx I
02:39 - hope you are familiar uh familiar with
02:42 - the scan of synx here we are using what
02:44 - two subscript I and J one for row and
02:46 - one for column right now we have entered
02:50 - suppose values here the working of these
02:52 - Loops also I have discussed in previous
02:54 - videos so I'm not know know discussing
02:57 - the working of this for we'll also we
02:59 - will only discuss the working of the
03:01 - four those for we will use for printing
03:04 - the 2D array and calculating the sum
03:06 - this thing we have already discussed so
03:08 - you can check out the previous videos so
03:10 - suppose I have entered some values like
03:12 - this 10 - 1 3 0 2 and 5 these values I
03:19 - have
03:20 - entered now calculate sum and print this
03:24 - Matrix or print this 2D array and I want
03:27 - to print in this pattern only like 10 -
03:30 - 1 3 0 2
03:34 - 5 this should be the not it's like 10 -1
03:38 - 3 0 2 54 in one line no I don't want
03:41 - that kind of output and this format only
03:43 - I want in Matrix format right so you
03:45 - have to take care of this thing also 10
03:48 - then some space then minus one then
03:50 - space then three in the next line next
03:52 - row right so this is this form I want
03:55 - output and also then sum of this so how
03:59 - to print obviously two for Loops right
04:01 - we are going to access these elements so
04:03 - one for row and one for column so
04:06 - same Loop would be from Outer Loop would
04:09 - be 0 to two then within this J would be
04:14 - 0 to 3 see need of the for Loops also we
04:17 - have discussed if you are not aware if
04:20 - you're not clear that why I'm using
04:22 - these kind of for Loop nexted for Loop
04:24 - what is the reason behind this you you
04:26 - must go and check out the video that
04:27 - I'll put in the description box of this
04:29 - video sorry the IE button of this uh
04:30 - this video so you can check out here the
04:32 - link I'll provide here right so now for
04:36 - printing purpose we will use print a
04:39 - function right and here I'm not printing
04:42 - or maybe you can print first of
04:45 - all and see how to access how to print
04:49 - this one array
04:51 - name in first subscript I and in second
04:55 - we have j i and J one for row and one
04:58 - for column right and here only we are
05:03 - calculating sum also so how to calculate
05:07 - sum same formula as we have discussed in
05:10 - 1D aray sum
05:12 - plus we will add these one so a of
05:17 - I and J and whatever the sum that you
05:20 - will store in a sum variable right and
05:24 - at last we can print the sum so before
05:26 - using the sum also you have to declare
05:29 - it and also we will initialize with a
05:31 - zero if you will not initialize it with
05:33 - a zero it will you know take some
05:35 - garbage value and then it will not give
05:36 - you the correct output because garbage
05:38 - Value Plus this data some garbage value
05:41 - you will get
05:42 - right so now okay but
05:47 - see now if you simply write this thing
05:50 - and suppose after this four loop after
05:52 - these four Loops Su has been calculated
05:55 - within this for loop after this for Loop
05:58 - we will print some sum so sum equal to
06:02 - percentage D and sum that's it but see
06:09 - here are some mistakes also we will
06:11 - correct those mistakes but let me dry
06:13 - run this first then you will get those
06:15 - mistakes better
06:18 - right now when compiler will go come
06:20 - here here we will write main function
06:23 - and within the main function this thing
06:25 - so size would be declared three for six
06:28 - elements right like this not like this
06:31 - this is how we see the size would be
06:34 - located but that would be in linear form
06:36 - either row measure or in colum me form
06:39 - one variable
06:40 - I one variable J one
06:44 - is sum sum is having zero and I and J
06:47 - are having some garbage value right and
06:50 - suppose this is our address of this is
06:54 - let me show you how this this is to be
06:56 - stored in memory actually I hope you are
06:59 - clear with this memory representation we
07:01 - have discussed in the previous video so
07:02 - you can check out that video right so
07:04 - this is how actually memory to memory is
07:05 - to be
07:06 - allocated to this two to this two uh
07:10 - Matrix first of all the first row would
07:12 - be stored and then the second row would
07:14 - be stored like this right so now I hope
07:17 - this working of these for Loop the
07:19 - scanner function is clear I have entered
07:20 - this data now this for Loop for I is
07:24 - equal to 0 okay I would be initial zero
07:27 - condition true enter here J would be
07:28 - zero condition enter here now print F
07:31 - percentage D what a of I I is zero J is
07:36 - also zero so a of 0 0 a of 0 0 means
07:41 - this data would be printed right this is
07:44 - a of 0 0 row is 0 column is also 0 0 0
07:48 - this is 0 1 this is 02 this is 1 0 1 1
07:52 - and 1 2 right so this would be existed
07:56 - and 10 would be printed so 10 would be
07:58 - printed
08:00 - right I'm printing here only 10 10 would
08:02 - be printed then sum is equal to Su plus
08:05 - A5 whatever the value in sum sum is 0
08:09 - plus A5 a i j a i j is i 0 0 that is 10
08:14 - 0 + 10 that would be stored in sum so
08:17 - here in sum now we have 10 right now we
08:20 - are in this inner for Loop so now j++ so
08:23 - J becomes what now one condition two
08:27 - enter again now again print F A of0 and
08:31 - now J is 1 so if 0 1 is this one so
08:35 - minus one would be printed without any
08:38 - space but I want in a matrix form so I
08:42 - think you should want a space here some
08:45 - space so that would be what you can use
08:47 - here/ T tab so after this percentage you
08:53 - can directly write down SLT Within These
08:56 - Braes Within These codes quotes right so
09:01 - whatever in these double quotes that
09:02 - would be printed on the screen as it is
09:04 - but one have percentage D only that
09:06 - would be replaced by the value here
09:08 - after this comma and then SLT means tab
09:10 - so tab means a space would be printed
09:14 - here and then minus one would be printed
09:16 - right so this is what you have to do one
09:19 - more thing you have to do that also we
09:21 - discuss now see again sum plus a of I
09:25 - now sum is 10 so 10 + a of 0 and 1 1 0 1
09:30 - is -1 so 10 + -1 that is 9 so 9 would be
09:35 - updated here again j++ now J becomes two
09:39 - condition true yes again enter here
09:41 - again print one tab space a of zero and
09:45 - now J is 2 02 is this one so three would
09:48 - be printed now sum plus this one now sum
09:51 - is 9 so 9 + a of 0 2 J is 2 9 + 3 that
09:58 - is 2 12 so now in sum we have 12 right
10:02 - j++ now J becomes three condition not
10:05 - true yes exit from the inner loop and in
10:08 - the outer loop still we are in this Loop
10:11 - so I ++ so now I becomes one condition
10:14 - true 1 less than two again enter here
10:17 - again J would be initialized with
10:22 - zero
10:24 - right so that would be for the next
10:27 - column sorry the next row
10:29 - right now again condition true enter
10:32 - here now
10:35 - see how percentage
10:38 - d/t means tab would be printed and a of
10:42 - now I value is 1 and J value is zero at
10:46 - this point I value is
10:48 - 1 1 and J is zero so 1 Z means 1 and
10:54 - zero this value would be printed here
10:56 - only but I want that should be printed
10:58 - in next line right so after printing the
11:02 - complete Row one slashing we require for
11:05 - new
11:06 - line and uh this for Loop the inner for
11:10 - Loop is responsible to print the
11:12 - complete row so after completing the
11:15 - inner loop inner for Loop you want to
11:17 - print a slash n within this outer for
11:20 - Loop right so after this inner loop
11:24 - here right simply after this inner loop
11:29 - here simply you can write print F
11:33 - /n and this should be in this outer loop
11:36 - right not with out out of this outer
11:38 - loop after that we will close this outer
11:41 - loop so after this what whatever the
11:45 - line exit from this inner loop When J
11:47 - becomes three whatever the line after
11:49 - this Loop that would be executed that is
11:50 - sln so now control is here cursor is
11:53 - here and now I ++ so I becomes one so
11:57 - now whatever the value at 1 Z that that
11:59 - will be printed
12:00 - here now again j++ J becomes
12:03 - one and I hope you can see how this you
12:07 - are able to now see how this is to be
12:10 - the working of this Loop Printing and
12:12 - sound right now again one and one so
12:15 - here one and one this data would be
12:17 - accessed that is two would be printed
12:19 - and now in sum two again plus two like
12:23 - this some would be calculated so you dry
12:25 - run this you yourself dry run this
12:27 - program completely
12:29 - right before jumping to your laptop
12:33 - right and see what sum you you are
12:36 - getting and how it is printing here
12:38 - right so I hope that this dryon of this
12:41 - is clear so now after after this for
12:43 - loop after printing of this and we have
12:45 - calculated sum then we are going to
12:47 - print sum percentage D whatever the
12:49 - value in the sum variable that would be
12:52 - printed so I hope it's clear to you so
12:55 - now let me show you this practically so
12:58 - so now let me create one file for you
13:01 - I'm writing
13:04 - print
13:06 - 2D
13:07 - array right do c please ignore my naming
13:13 - of the programs
13:18 - right header
13:20 - file and uh then we will write down what
13:23 - main
13:24 - function and here we will take one array
13:27 - array of uh three and suppose I'm
13:30 - writing three or take same areay two and
13:35 - three you can change the size according
13:38 - to you once you get the logic I then one
13:40 - variable is a j and one sum that is
13:43 - initialize with uh zero and I'm just
13:47 - writing down
13:49 - enter elements
13:52 - of 2D array
13:56 - right uh so in the for Loop we'll use
14:01 - outer for Loop would be for the row so
14:03 - less than two and I
14:06 - ++ and now inner four Loop would be for
14:09 - columns so to 0 to
14:13 - 3 and
14:16 - j++ and within this we will use what
14:19 - scanf to take input percentage D and
14:22 - then address
14:23 - of a of I and J
14:29 - right so that's it now we are going to
14:33 - print right so now before writing before
14:37 - writing the for Loop I'm just writing
14:39 - what print F or you can write here
14:41 - rather than 2D array you can write down
14:44 - here metric enter element of a matrix
14:48 - right so I'm just printing
14:51 - here Matrix
14:54 - is
14:56 - right and the new line so now I'm just
15:00 - uh you know I'm just copying the four
15:03 - Loops these four
15:06 - Loops because condition would be same 0
15:08 - to two and in would be 0 to 3 rather
15:11 - than this scanner we will write what
15:14 - print F percentage D here we write a/t
15:18 - Tab and syntax would be this one and
15:23 - then we will do sum sum is equal to a of
15:27 - I and uh
15:30 - J right and I guess that's it after the
15:35 - inner for Loop one more line we will
15:38 - write that is what
15:43 - slash and after the for loop after for
15:47 - Loop we will just print the sum sum
15:52 - equal
15:53 - to percentage D it should be next line
15:57 - so better to use a slash
15:59 - in Comma just write sum and slashing I
16:04 - hope it will work let me just run
16:10 - this so it will ask uh what the number
16:13 - of elements of a matrix it should ask I
16:17 - don't know it will ask or not yeah ENT
16:19 - the element of Matrix so I'm entering
16:22 - and elements like uh 1 then 2 - 1 3 4 4
16:30 - 5 C Matrix is 1 2 - 1 that is first row
16:35 - then 3 4 5 that is second row and sum is
16:40 - five okay here the problem is I have
16:43 - written sum is equal to sum is equal to
16:46 - see so two equal TOS it should be sum
16:52 - plus yeah now let me just run
16:56 - this again so enter the elements here
16:59 - again I'm entering 1 then 2 - 1 4 3 2
17:06 - and see 1 2 - 1 First Row 4 3 2 second
17:08 - row and now sum is 11 so 2 + 1 3 3 3 6
17:13 - and 10 12 - 1 yeah some is sum is 11 so
17:16 - now it's correct right so now this is
17:19 - how you can print a matrix of any size 3
17:22 - into 3 3 into 4 5 into 5 any size you
17:24 - can take here so from the next video
17:27 - we'll see some more program on metrix so
17:29 - now I'll see you in the next video till
17:30 - then bye-bye take care
