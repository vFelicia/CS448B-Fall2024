00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language in the
00:05 - previous video we have seen what is
00:06 - event listening and how to implement
00:08 - this thing right in Python using Turtle
00:11 - Graphics right so now based on that
00:14 - we'll be seeing one coding exercise in
00:15 - this video right let me show you I want
00:19 - to draw something this kind of thing
00:20 - like a sketch kind of thing so uh so
00:24 - whenever you run that you'll get a
00:26 - turtle and uh you can move like
00:30 - while pressing any key suppose I'm
00:33 - pressing F key to move forward like B to
00:39 - move backward and
00:42 - L to tilt and move something like this
00:46 - and R to move something like this then L
00:51 - then maybe like
00:54 - R and you you're going to you know draw
00:57 - any sketch then again forward then maybe
01:01 - backward then left then maybe right
01:05 - something like this any
01:07 - sketch right and after
01:10 - that it should like clear the screen as
01:13 - well like I want to clear the screen
01:16 - after the drawing of this Turtle I want
01:18 - to clear that drawing right so that
01:21 - thing also so any sketch like you can
01:25 - draw using that right so let's clear the
01:30 - screen using C and at last Turtle would
01:33 - be should be at the home position at 0 0
01:36 - coordinate right so how we are going to
01:39 - draw this thing because in the previous
01:41 - video we have seen only we can we are
01:42 - going to tilt the turtle to 90° angle
01:45 - 270 180 something like this but here the
01:49 - angle we don't know at particular which
01:51 - particular angle right so for that the
01:56 - hint is you can use those heading and
01:58 - set heading kind of thing
02:00 - how to do how to use how to set the
02:02 - heading that you need to take care right
02:05 - so pause the video and try this out so I
02:07 - hope you have done this let's create a
02:10 - new file and same what we need to do
02:13 - first the basic thing from Turtle just
02:16 - import the turtle class and Screen class
02:21 - right and let's create a turttle Tom do
02:25 - to is equal to turtle and also create a
02:28 - screen
02:31 - screen is equal to the class name is
02:33 - screen with capital S so object name you
02:36 - can take like S1 s or AB BCD or anything
02:39 - right and at last first let's do exit on
02:43 - this thing right okay
02:46 - now we you have to bind the thing F key
02:50 - to move forward b key to move backward
02:53 - then
02:54 - L to turn left R press R to turn right
02:59 - something like this and C for clearing
03:02 - the screen clearing the drawing of that
03:04 - particular to right okay so let's Define
03:08 - function we have like one function is
03:10 - move
03:13 - forward so this here tural is going to
03:16 - move in forward Direction by maybe 20
03:19 - pixel or 10 pixel suppose 10 right and
03:23 - we have one is same like
03:27 - move move backward and we have for that
03:30 - also either you can use back or backward
03:32 - these two functions Tom do backward we
03:35 - haven't used backward till now we were
03:37 - using only forward so let's use now this
03:40 - function also backward by 10 okay now
03:45 - when we have function like turn
03:48 - left okay now
03:51 - here there's no particular angle so
03:54 - wherever the turtle is from that just
03:57 - turn left left and just it's not like
03:59 - turn left to a particular angle right so
04:03 - what we'll do we will find out the
04:06 - heading first the current heading and
04:09 - then we will add something to that angle
04:11 - some angle like 5 or 10°
04:14 - okay so the current is how to find out
04:19 - current heading we have a function
04:20 - heading so this will give you the
04:23 - current heading of that total you will
04:25 - add plus like
04:28 - 20 or Plus 10 or 15 if you add plus
04:32 - 20
04:35 - so and it would be suppose new
04:39 - heading new heading is equal to current
04:42 - heading + 10 and after that just set
04:45 - that to heading set heading to whatever
04:48 - the new heading something like this and
04:51 - then
04:53 - forward 10
04:55 - pixel right same put on right okay okay
04:59 - not same there is a little bit
05:03 - difference you can pause the video and
05:05 - try this out how to do this function
05:07 - turn
05:09 - right in turn left we're adding plus
05:12 - then to move to turn it right just
05:15 - subtract the same thing like minus 20
05:18 - and the same thing everything the
05:21 - remaining thing would be same right so
05:23 - now you have to bind these things to
05:26 - that keys so first obviously you have to
05:28 - call that
05:30 - listen method on this screen object and
05:34 - now we have screen dot on key so the
05:38 - function is first let's take move
05:41 - forward without these brackets and the
05:44 - key I'm going to bind with this is
05:48 - f right so same you have to bind all the
05:52 - keys okay for clearing the screen Also
05:55 - let's define a function named clear
05:58 - uncore screen
06:00 - right so you have to clear the drawing
06:03 - of the turtle to not any other Turtle so
06:06 - on Tom we have a method clear right and
06:10 - then Tom should be in home
06:12 - location means at 0 coordinate so
06:15 - there's a method home right but for that
06:17 - first of all obviously you have to do
06:19 - pen up
06:20 - otherwise it will draw a line while
06:23 - moving to the home location right and
06:28 - after moving to the home location just
06:30 - do pen down because again if you want to
06:32 - draw any sketch then it should be pen
06:35 - down this clear screen this method we
06:37 - have seen in previous video also right
06:40 - okay now okay now let's run this and see
06:43 - what is happening here so there's a
06:45 - turtle I'm moving forward I'm pressing F
06:48 - key so moving forward I'm pressing L key
06:51 - so I'll be moving in upward Direction in
06:55 - r c right L again
07:00 - or
07:01 - B like this then again L then right
07:07 - something like this right and if I press
07:10 - C then cleared all my drawing and all
07:14 - right so this is how you can do this
07:16 - kind of thing also right I hope you got
07:19 - this this exercise like this you can
07:21 - draw many shapes and you can just Define
07:24 - different different functions you can
07:25 - bind those functions with different
07:27 - different keys right on your keyboard
07:30 - and like this right so I hope you got
07:33 - this one now I'll see you in the next
07:35 - till then byebye take care
