00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:01 - programming we are discussing file
00:03 - opening modes in c we have discussed
00:04 - read mode right mode append mode r plus
00:07 - mode w plus mode now we are left with
00:09 - one more that is a plus mode we will see
00:11 - this mode in this video with the help of
00:13 - a program i will show you practical also
00:15 - and we will also see how the c plus mode
00:17 - is different from our plus and w plus
00:19 - right but before they just want to tell

01:50 - the description box of this video if you
01:52 - are interested you can go and check out
01:54 - now let us see what is a plus mode
01:56 - see
01:57 - suppose i have a file
01:59 - abc.txt
02:02 - and in this file i have only
02:04 - jenny
02:05 - this text i have right so here a plus
02:09 - means you are opening this file both for
02:11 - reading and
02:13 - appending
02:15 - see not reading and writing
02:17 - appending is different thing appending
02:18 - means writing at the end of the file
02:21 - writing means
02:23 - maybe you can write from the in the
02:24 - beginning of the file or anywhere in the
02:26 - you know you can move your file pointer
02:28 - and you can you know write down anywhere
02:30 - in that file
02:31 - but basically we will
02:33 - say it will open the file for reading
02:35 - and appending
02:37 - if you will read then the cursor would
02:39 - be here for reading purpose the cursor
02:41 - would be here at the starting and jenny
02:42 - would be printed on the screen if you
02:44 - are going to append something means the
02:47 - cursor would be here and from here you
02:48 - can append from the end of the file
02:50 - means appending means basically writing
02:52 - at the end of the file
02:53 - so if i want to append khatri so that
02:55 - would be appended here
02:58 - at the end of the file
02:59 - right
03:01 - i'll show you
03:02 - see it doesn't mean for reading it has
03:05 - one pointer that is at the beginning of
03:07 - the file for appending it has another
03:09 - pointer at the end of the file means it
03:11 - has basically two pointer no
03:13 - only one pointer is there right
03:16 - it depends if you are reading that
03:17 - pointer will be moved here if you are
03:19 - writing if you want to write you if you
03:21 - want to append something
03:23 - then the cursor would be moved here only
03:25 - the file pointer and
03:26 - the you know whatever you want to write
03:28 - that would be appended from the end of
03:30 - the file right only one pointer is there
03:32 - so now see
03:34 - i am writing one thing
03:36 - the program here
03:38 - obviously we are going to create a file
03:40 - pointer first and that is null right and
03:43 - i am going to open this file using the
03:46 - function f open and the name is abc.txt
03:50 - and in a plus mode
03:53 - so
03:54 - it will open this file first
03:57 - for both reading and appending and if
03:59 - file does not exist means if there is no
04:01 - such file in my pc
04:03 - then it will create a new file a plus
04:05 - mod will create a new file and the new
04:08 - file would be opened
04:09 - right
04:11 - in wplus also if file does not exist it
04:13 - will open a file but in r plus if file
04:15 - does not exist
04:17 - it will not open a file it will return
04:18 - null
04:19 - that's it right
04:21 - now you can check here if
04:24 - f p is equal to is equal to null then
04:27 - you can simply print here
04:29 - like
04:30 - file doesn't exist
04:34 - or maybe you can write no cannot open
04:37 - file
04:38 - or you can print any error and exit one
04:42 - if file has been opened successfully by
04:43 - the safe woman function
04:45 - then
04:46 - and suppose in my file i have only jenny
04:50 - so
04:51 - if you want to read first you can write
04:53 - down the logic of reading right and
04:55 - jenny would be printed
04:57 - if you want to write something append
04:59 - something you can simply write down
05:01 - suppose i am writing f put s a string i
05:03 - want to append like jenny
05:05 - and after that i want to append khatri
05:07 - so you can simply put that string here
05:09 - comma and
05:11 - file pointer fp
05:13 - right
05:14 - so this complete string and at last you
05:17 - can close the file f close
05:20 - fp
05:22 - so now this khatri would be appended
05:25 - here only
05:27 - right now after this if you want to read
05:30 - if you want to write down the logic then
05:31 - what is the logic simply you can
05:34 - write down a loop
05:36 - f eof function
05:38 - fp
05:39 - and suppose i am
05:41 - reading character by character ch is
05:43 - equal to
05:44 - f getc function is used to read a
05:47 - character
05:48 - and the file pointer you can pass here
05:50 - and whatever you read the character you
05:53 - can simply
05:54 - print
05:56 - that's it
05:57 - before using ch you are supposed to
05:59 - declare this
06:02 - right
06:03 - but it is not going to read why so
06:05 - because after appending khatri here
06:08 - now the cursor is at the last
06:11 - and if you want to read
06:13 - the cursor should move from here to here
06:15 - at the beginning so you can use after
06:17 - this after this what you will use which
06:18 - function
06:20 - rewind that we have discussed in
06:21 - previous video
06:23 - right rewind
06:24 - and fp that's it
06:27 - now cursor would move moved from the
06:28 - last to the beginning and after that you
06:30 - can read after this now janik would be
06:32 - printed right
06:34 - so what is the difference between you
06:36 - can say w plus
06:39 - r plus w plus and a plus if you compare
06:43 - it will open for reading and writing but
06:45 - a file doesn't exist it will not create
06:47 - a new file
06:48 - right
06:49 - it will open a file both for reading and
06:51 - writing
06:53 - but
06:54 - one thing the previous content if file
06:56 - exists then previous content would be
06:58 - erased
06:59 - right means the new content whatever you
07:01 - write that would be overwritten
07:03 - means the previous content would be
07:04 - overwritten right if this is a file if
07:07 - you are opening this in w plus this dani
07:08 - khati would be erased and whatever you
07:10 - will write that would be written from
07:11 - here only in r plus the previous content
07:14 - would be as it is right
07:17 - in a plus also
07:20 - if and if file doesn't exist it will
07:22 - create a new file in a plus also it will
07:24 - create it will open for reading and
07:26 - appending means the previous content
07:28 - would be as it is and whatever you will
07:30 - write that would be appended at the last
07:32 - and if file doesn't exist it will create
07:34 - a new file so i hope now you can write
07:36 - down the difference between r plus w
07:38 - plus and a plus right now let me show
07:41 - you practically
07:42 - and see one more thing if you will not
07:44 - write this f put s
07:46 - here
07:46 - these two lines and directly i am
07:48 - writing this reading logic right so what
07:51 - it will print if suppose in my file i
07:53 - have jenny so it will print jenny
07:57 - right and after this reading logic if
08:00 - you write f put as khatri fp
08:02 - then khatri would be appended here but
08:04 - khatri would not be printed because
08:08 - khatri would not be red because you have
08:10 - you know written this this logic reading
08:13 - logic
08:14 - here and after after this logic you are
08:16 - writing something so that would be
08:18 - appended here
08:19 - but on the screen only jenny would be
08:21 - printed i hope you are getting my point
08:23 - now let me show you practical then you
08:24 - will get it better see i have this file
08:26 - a plus one i have created this file a
08:28 - plus mode dot c and here i am opening
08:30 - this abc suppose abc
08:33 - dot txt file in a plus mode right
08:36 - i'm just checking the condition if not
08:38 - going to open then just print no file
08:40 - otherwise
08:41 - first of all i am reading
08:43 - see i have just written the reading
08:44 - logic while this character by character
08:47 - i'm going to read and after that i'm
08:49 - going to write down in that file f
08:51 - protest this is awesome right i'm going
08:53 - to append see so now in abc dot txt file
08:57 - we have jennifer's awesome faculty right
08:59 - this content i already have
09:02 - so let me just run this and show you the
09:05 - output see it will print on the screen
09:07 - jenny khatri is awesome faculty right
09:11 - see
09:12 - jenny khatri is awesome faculty right
09:14 - and
09:16 - now just check the file abc dot txt now
09:18 - in this file we have the content jenny
09:20 - kathryn faculty as well as this is
09:22 - awesome
09:24 - at the end of the file because you are
09:25 - appending this file footage this is
09:27 - awesome
09:28 - right this is what appending means
09:29 - writing at the end of the file right and
09:32 - if you will write this line
09:37 - and suppose this file doesn't exist i'm
09:39 - writing here a dot txt i don't have this
09:41 - file in my pci dot txt so now let me
09:44 - just save it and run it and show you the
09:46 - output
09:48 - see what it is printing on the screen
09:50 - nothing
09:51 - because this file is not there in my pc
09:54 - it will create this file
09:56 - right and it will open the file it will
09:58 - create a new file so there is nothing in
10:00 - that file so we are writing first of all
10:01 - the reading logic so what it will read
10:03 - nothing
10:04 - and after that it will write in the file
10:06 - this is awesome
10:08 - so in the file if i check see this is
10:10 - the file a dot txt
10:12 - in the file i am having this is awesome
10:15 - right if file doesn't exist it will
10:16 - create a new file
10:19 - now
10:20 - suppose i am writing here but abc dot
10:22 - txt file and this this f put s
10:26 - this logic i am writing
10:28 - before this reading logic
10:31 - first of all i am going to append this
10:32 - is awesome in this file and after that i
10:34 - will read
10:35 - right and i am not writing that rewind
10:38 - function so now let me just show you
10:40 - what output you will get
10:46 - see
10:48 - it is not going to read anything
10:50 - it is just running because cursor is at
10:53 - the end of the file
10:54 - right
10:55 - so better to now first of all
10:58 - kill this terminal
10:59 - and now let me just try down that
11:03 - rewind function rewind fp
11:07 - now let me just run this again and show
11:09 - you the output
11:15 - see now it will print jenny khatri is
11:16 - awesome fake lt this is awesome this is
11:18 - awesome two time
11:21 - a dot tx sorry abc dot txt because here
11:24 - we have first of all it was jenny khatri
11:25 - is awesome faculty this is awesome this
11:27 - is awesome two time
11:29 - right because last time also when we run
11:31 - this abc txt this is awesome was added
11:35 - right
11:36 - but while you are fetching the content
11:38 - at that time it was not printing
11:40 - anything it was just running because the
11:42 - cursor was at the end we haven't moved
11:44 - that fp pointer
11:46 - to the beginning of this uh file yeah
11:49 - but content was appended this is awesome
11:51 - that's why it is showing two time this
11:53 - is awesome this is awesome i hope you go
11:54 - to my point right
11:56 - so now i hope the same plus mode is
11:57 - clear to you
11:59 - so i hope this a plus mode is clear to
12:00 - you now we have discussed all the modes
12:02 - all the six modes read
12:05 - write append r plus w plus a plus one
12:08 - now we are left with some special
12:09 - function like you can say rewind
12:11 - fc function so these kind of function
12:13 - will discuss in the next video so i'll
12:14 - see in the next video till then bye take
12:16 - care
