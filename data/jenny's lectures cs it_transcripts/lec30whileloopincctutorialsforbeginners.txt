00:00 - so in the series of learning C plus plus
00:02 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - Loops in C plus plus till now we have
00:05 - discussed for Loop and properties of
00:07 - formal properties means like uh
00:09 - different different ways in which you
00:10 - can write down a while loop some tricky
00:12 - things you can do with while that thing
00:13 - we have discussed in previous videos
00:15 - right the next is while loop so now that
00:18 - thing we'll be discussing in this video
00:19 - what is while loop syntax or while loop
00:21 - flow chart uh working of this while loop
00:23 - with the help of flowchart application
00:25 - so you can say use of while loop with
00:27 - the help of three or four programs we
00:29 - will be seeing these things practically
00:32 - so each and every detail about while
00:34 - loop will be discussing in this video
00:35 - right now before that just want to tell
00:38 - you one thing see if uh your dream is to
00:41 - get placed with a high package in
00:43 - software field then definitely this
00:45 - information is helpful for you guys
00:47 - let me just ask you one thing first
00:49 - why is it important for a pressure to
00:52 - get placed in a high paying software job
00:56 - it's not just about the salary it saves
00:58 - time yeah see instead of getting a hike
01:01 - after two to three years if initially
01:03 - you get placed with a higher package
01:05 - then definitely it saves time right but
01:09 - how
01:10 - do you need to be from the top colleges
01:12 - does your branch matter
01:14 - do you have to be intelligent the answer
01:17 - is no
01:18 - if you have industry relevant skills
01:20 - then companies are ready to offer you
01:22 - high package now you can ask me how see
01:25 - thousands of students need final year of
01:27 - graduates started from zero build
01:30 - industry relevant skills and got placed
01:32 - in high paying software jobs they got
01:34 - hired by thousand plus companies
01:36 - how who is behind all these it is a
01:39 - proven curriculum developed by IIT
01:41 - graduates who worked with the top
01:43 - companies like Amazon Microsoft has
01:45 - product Developers
01:47 - and the name of this uh this proven
01:50 - curriculum is next wave ccbp intensive
01:53 - program
01:53 - see many of us wants to get placed with
01:57 - high package in software Fields but you
02:00 - might not know what skills are required
02:01 - for that and how to learn from where to
02:03 - learn these skills right
02:05 - so to know these things you can attend
02:09 - and make use of the free demo offered by
02:12 - next wave ccbp intensive team link is in
02:15 - the description box of this video and
02:16 - one more thing you can also get a
02:18 - scholarship up to rupees up to rupees 15
02:20 - 000 but it is for limited period of time
02:22 - and it is limited offer so go now and
02:24 - register your free demo I hope it would
02:26 - be a turning point in your career now
02:28 - let's see let's discuss what is for Loop
02:31 - in C plus plus
02:33 - see why we use Loops basically what is
02:35 - need of loop if you want to execute a
02:38 - statement or block of statement
02:39 - repeatedly more than one time five times
02:41 - ten time hundred times so as many times
02:43 - as you want repeatedly you want to
02:45 - execute those statements then then we
02:47 - put these statements in a loop and we
02:50 - put some condition right
02:52 - now while loop is what simply you can
02:55 - write it executes a block of statements
02:58 - as long as the condition the given
03:00 - condition is true now what is syntax of
03:03 - while loop see you simply write y
03:05 - keyword here you will put some condition
03:10 - termination condition we can say and
03:13 - here we write
03:14 - block of statements
03:16 - okay
03:17 - you can write one statement or multiple
03:20 - statements this is block of statements
03:22 - so this is General syntax of writing
03:24 - while loop right let me just take one
03:26 - example see
03:28 - okay so let's
03:30 - see this is the example see in for loop
03:32 - I have told you three basically things
03:35 - are there with for Loop one is
03:38 - initialization then termination
03:40 - condition then modify expression and
03:42 - then we can say one is statements you
03:44 - want to execute soap but in syntax we
03:47 - haven't written any initialization here
03:49 - and any incremental decrement right that
03:52 - in for Loop we have written like in one
03:54 - statement only four here initialization
03:56 - then condition then update or that a
03:59 - modify expression and here we write some
04:01 - statement that you want to execute and
04:03 - again again and again but here in one
04:05 - line we only write here if you only
04:07 - write condition
04:09 - only one thing no initialization no
04:12 - modifying expression so where we write
04:13 - these things
04:14 - and it is not compulsory to write
04:16 - initialization and these things no
04:19 - yeah but it is mandatory too
04:21 - write down to specify the termination
04:24 - condition otherwise unexpected result
04:27 - you will get maybe it would be infinite
04:28 - Loop or maybe compiler energy will get
04:30 - these things also will be discussing one
04:32 - by one right now let's see here this is
04:35 - one example so simply here I am using
04:39 - all the three things this is what
04:40 - initialization before starting of this
04:42 - while loop this is termination condition
04:44 - and here modify expression within this
04:48 - block of statements right so this
04:51 - condition and these are these two are
04:53 - block of statements
04:56 - right so as long as this condition is
04:58 - true then these statements would be
05:01 - executed again and again right so now
05:04 - see int I is equal to 1 we have
05:06 - specified I variable here we have
05:08 - one condition is I Less Than 3 1 Less
05:11 - Than 3 yes so control will enter into
05:13 - this while loop and one would be printed
05:15 - now slash N means next line cursor will
05:18 - be next line you line then I plus plus
05:20 - then it becomes 2.
05:22 - again condition check two Less Than 3
05:24 - yes 2 would be printed then I plus plus
05:27 - I is 3 now 3 Less Than 3 no now out of
05:31 - this while loop so you will get 1 and 2.
05:34 - right and one thing this while loop is
05:36 - what entry controlled Loop two
05:38 - categories of loop exit control and
05:40 - entry control so it is entry controlled
05:43 - Loop
05:44 - while entering we are checking the
05:46 - condition right exit control means while
05:49 - exiting the loop we will check the
05:50 - condition while entering will not check
05:51 - any condition
05:53 - right
05:55 - like when you go in Metro then while you
05:57 - entering while you will enter into the
05:59 - Metro before entering they will check
06:01 - you if you have any suspicious item or
06:03 - not right and when you go in a
06:06 - supermarket then while exiting the
06:09 - supermarket they will check the items
06:10 - and the bill
06:11 - so this you can relate with these things
06:13 - four and while loop are entry control
06:15 - Loop okay if the condition is not true
06:18 - then you will you cannot enter into this
06:20 - while loop like if you have any knife or
06:23 - any suspicious item you cannot enter
06:24 - into the that Metro
06:27 - and dual is exit control do you can
06:30 - enter in while loop no matter the
06:32 - condition is true or not while exiting
06:34 - it will check the condition right
06:37 - so here these statements would be
06:39 - executed these two statements again and
06:42 - again
06:43 - as long as this condition is true as
06:46 - long as I is less than 3 right now here
06:49 - one thing is very important it is really
06:51 - important to update this eye here if you
06:54 - will not update I here then it would be
06:56 - an infinite Loop if you will not write
06:58 - here then see out I I becomes I it will
07:02 - print one again it will check I is still
07:04 - 1 because no increment is there so 1 is
07:07 - less than 3 yes I would always be less
07:10 - than 3 and it would be an infinite loop
07:12 - again it will print 1 1 1 1 1 infinite
07:15 - Loop would be there right so it's
07:18 - important to update I here sometimes
07:23 - we only write like this condition while
07:25 - one
07:27 - so this condition is always true
07:30 - so we need sometimes in finite Loops so
07:33 - that also we'll be discussing in which
07:34 - condition what are infinite loops and
07:36 - why we use infinite loops and how to
07:38 - control how to you can say uh
07:41 - terminate these infinite Loop that also
07:43 - will see so I hope you got what is while
07:46 - loop General syntax or while loop
07:48 - General work move by Loop let me just
07:50 - tell you let me just show you the
07:52 - flowchart with the help of flowchart the
07:54 - working of value see
07:57 - here
07:59 - we check the condition
08:01 - right
08:02 - if this condition is true
08:04 - then
08:07 - body of while loop or body of loop would
08:10 - be executed or you can say these
08:12 - statement would be executed right and
08:14 - again condition would be checked this
08:17 - should be in Loop once condition becomes
08:19 - false we are going to exit from this
08:22 - Loop right whatever you will write here
08:25 - those statement would be executed but
08:27 - this is with help of flowchart you can
08:29 - show the working of while loop right now
08:33 - use of while loop basically we can use
08:36 - this if you want to check if you want to
08:39 - put some validation on input
08:41 - right that in that case we can use this
08:44 - thing fine let me just show you these
08:47 - users with the help of program so let's
08:49 - create a new file
08:52 - let's write while loop
08:57 - extension is dot CPP right
09:00 - and first is first we will write
09:05 - like for user validation for user input
09:08 - validation we can use while loop how you
09:10 - can write down this thing
09:12 - see
09:16 - so let's
09:18 - take a number suppose n
09:21 - and from user
09:23 - will ask enter
09:27 - number
09:28 - and enter number greater than
09:33 - suppose greater than
09:35 - 6.
09:36 - okay
09:39 - I want a number greater than 6 right so
09:42 - you have to check now number is greater
09:45 - than 6 or not the number you have
09:46 - entered so that thing we can do with
09:48 - this
09:49 - uh how you can write down this thing
09:51 - with white Loop we can write down while
10:01 - this number n
10:04 - this number n
10:06 - less than
10:07 - equal to 6.
10:13 - if this is the case then we just simply
10:17 - print what
10:19 - please enter number greater than 6 and
10:22 - then C in again number
10:26 - n right and after that simply we can do
10:29 - whatever you want to do or here simply I
10:31 - am printing thanks
10:34 - that's it right
10:36 - foreign
10:41 - I hope now you can see right whatever I
10:44 - have written here so now let's save this
10:47 - and let's run this so it is asking enter
10:49 - a number greater than six I am entering
10:51 - 3. please enter number greater than six
10:54 - I am entering 1. please enter number
10:56 - greater than 6 I'm entering seven so
10:58 - thanks
11:00 - so you can validate you can you know put
11:03 - some validation on user input with while
11:04 - loop
11:06 - now the assignment for you is suppose I
11:09 - want a number between not greater than 6
11:12 - number
11:14 - between 2 and 7.
11:19 - this is the thing I want between two and
11:21 - seven so now you have to put what
11:24 - condition you will write in this while
11:25 - loop now think and write down
11:28 - so I hope you have tried this thing now
11:30 - what condition we'll put between two and
11:33 - seven between two and seven means you
11:36 - want three
11:38 - three four five six right so in while we
11:41 - can write down something like this
11:42 - number
11:45 - less than equal to 2
11:48 - sorry less than equal to 2 or
11:53 - two condition you need to put logical or
11:55 - operator number
11:57 - greater than equal to 7.
12:03 - right it's not num we have taken a
12:06 - variable and only so that is why it is
12:08 - giving error Red Line because the
12:10 - variable name is n this condition you
12:12 - need to put
12:14 - if this is the case then we write
12:16 - try again or here you can write
12:19 - please enter
12:22 - valid number same thanks and then after
12:26 - that see out thanks right let me just
12:29 - run this and show you the output
12:32 - enter number between
12:34 - 2 and 7 see
12:38 - so I'm entering here eight
12:41 - please enter valid number one
12:43 - please enter valid number I'm entering 2
12:46 - it is also not valid between 2 and 7 I
12:49 - want so I'm entering here five
12:52 - thanks so this is what you can do
12:56 - next thing what we can do suppose I want
13:00 - like end and
13:02 - here I want what
13:07 - C out
13:11 - enter a positive number
13:14 - okay
13:17 - start countdown
13:20 - fine
13:24 - C in
13:26 - and
13:27 - so here we can put one here what we can
13:32 - put condition
13:34 - in while loop
13:36 - while
13:38 - sorry we have to put semicolon here
13:41 - while
13:42 - this n
13:44 - greater than
13:46 - 0 then here we can print this number
13:49 - simply C out number
13:52 - right and for new line I'm just adding
13:55 - this time slash in and then n minus
13:58 - minus
14:00 - right
14:02 - and after that in C out we can do
14:05 - something like this let's
14:08 - celebrate
14:09 - right
14:11 - so let's run this and see what output
14:15 - you are getting here in this case
14:18 - so enter a positive number
14:20 - and start countdown so I'm entering a
14:22 - positive number five
14:24 - so five four three two one let's
14:27 - celebrate
14:29 - like 10 9 8 this type of countdown
14:33 - so this second example of using the
14:36 - swine Loop and another thing with help
14:38 - of flag also you can write down this
14:40 - type of program
14:42 - between 2 and 7. if you want to check
14:45 - this condition so with help you can take
14:47 - a flag variable
14:50 - like wool flag and with the help of that
14:53 - also you can put this type this type of
14:55 - condition so let's pause the video and
14:57 - try it this out
14:59 - so I hope you have tried this out let's
15:01 - try this we will take a variable Bool
15:04 - name of this variable I am taking flag
15:05 - and that first time it can take either
15:08 - value true or false because it is a
15:10 - Boolean type Bull type so first of all
15:12 - bull uh the flag is false and in while I
15:16 - am writing not flag not flag means it
15:19 - would be now true the condition is true
15:21 - and we are going to enter in this while
15:23 - loop so now we can put our condition if
15:26 - if n
15:29 - n
15:30 - what less than
15:32 - between two to seven we want less than
15:34 - equal to 2 for n greater than equal to 7
15:38 - right
15:40 - so what we can write down here
15:43 - not a
15:44 - valid number
15:47 - okay
15:49 - this type of thing you can write down
15:51 - here find now
15:54 - else
15:57 - in else
15:59 - sorry we are not putting any condition
16:01 - here in else part we will write
16:05 - or we can simply write down thanks for
16:07 - entering a valid number right
16:09 - thanks
16:12 - plus this thing is really important the
16:14 - second line of else you have to set flag
16:18 - to what
16:21 - true okay one more thing we have to ask
16:24 - from the user to enter a number that
16:26 - thing we haven't written here so in this
16:28 - within this while we will ask C out
16:34 - enter number
16:37 - between
16:38 - 2 and 7.
16:40 - write this thing
16:42 - and then C in
16:45 - n
16:47 - then we put obviously the condition if
16:49 - number is less than equal to 2 or
16:51 - greater than 7 auto valid number else
16:52 - thanks and flag will set true
16:55 - okay now now let's run this
16:58 - and see what output you will get
17:02 - okay now enter number between 2 and 7
17:04 - I'm entering five so it will just bring
17:07 - things and out let's run this again
17:10 - two and seven I am entering eight and
17:12 - not a valid number then again it will
17:14 - ask enter number between two and seven
17:16 - again I'm entering zero not a valid
17:19 - number enter number between two and
17:21 - seven now I'm entering three
17:24 - no thanks right so I hope you go to
17:27 - working let's see the working if suppose
17:30 - first of all flag is false not false is
17:33 - what true right so we will enter into
17:35 - this while loop now it will ask enter
17:36 - number between two and seven suppose we
17:38 - enter three
17:40 - so this condition is not true if
17:42 - condition so the control will enter into
17:43 - else part it will print things and now
17:46 - we have to get out of this while loop
17:47 - because you haven't heard a valid number
17:49 - right
17:50 - so that is why you have to put flag true
17:52 - now flag is true so now after else again
17:56 - check the condition control will go here
17:58 - while not flag now flag is true not flag
18:02 - means false so it condition becomes
18:05 - false so now we will exit from this
18:07 - while right that is why it is important
18:09 - to set this flag true if you will not
18:12 - put here true then
18:15 - this condition will always be true
18:17 - because flag would always be false not
18:19 - false means true so it would be an
18:21 - infinite Loop
18:22 - right so this line is very important I
18:25 - hope you got the importance of this line
18:27 - so I hope you got basics of while loop
18:29 - working syntax and everything right now
18:32 - what tricky things you can do with while
18:33 - loop right and you can say or properties
18:36 - of while loop or you can say different
18:38 - different ways in which you can write
18:39 - down while loop sometimes they ask this
18:42 - type of question like they'll give you a
18:43 - code snippet and what would be the
18:45 - answer of this thing just here in that
18:47 - code we have while loop but they do some
18:50 - tricky things with that while loop like
18:52 - they can put semicolon after a while
18:54 - loop or they can change some condition
18:55 - and maybe you haven't tried that thing
18:58 - with while loop because you simply
18:59 - traditional way you are writing while
19:00 - loop and that's it this is why Loop no
19:02 - many things you can do with while loop
19:04 - right
19:05 - so at that time you will get confused
19:07 - like you haven't tried that thing with
19:08 - while loop you will maybe you will say
19:10 - this will be better but that will give
19:11 - some output so those kind of things some
19:14 - coding exercises we'll be discussing in
19:15 - next video with the help of programs
19:17 - also so now it's in the next video till
19:18 - then bye bye take care
