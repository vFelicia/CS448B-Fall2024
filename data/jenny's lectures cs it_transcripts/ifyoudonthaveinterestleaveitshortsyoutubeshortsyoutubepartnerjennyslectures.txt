00:00 - You all must have heard this " do that work
you are interested in " If you have interest
00:06 - u won't need MOTIVATION , you will be happy
while working and If you don't have interest
00:10 - leave it
BUT suppose you have started new job or you
00:13 - have started studying so sometimes you don't
have interest in your job or study from the
00:18 - first day but it doesn't mean you leave your
job or don't study..see if you start watching
00:21 - any web series and first and second episodes
are boring but still u keep watching and think
00:25 - may be third episode will have some twist
and make it interesting ..and it happens sometimes
00:30 - that from third episode that series becomes
interesting to you..
00:33 - Same goes with your job and study..
00:37 - push yourself a little bit and have patience
... may be after one month or two months that
00:46 - same job or study becomes interesting to you
guys..
