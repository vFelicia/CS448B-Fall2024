00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - operators in Python the last video we
00:05 - have discussed identity operators in
00:07 - Python so in this video we'll talk about
00:08 - one more operator is left that is
00:10 - membership operator so this thing we
00:12 - will discuss in this video everything
00:14 - about membership operator like what our
00:16 - membership operators and what are types
00:18 - of membership operator and I will show
00:19 - you with the help of program also so
00:21 - practical also we will see now see
00:24 - before going to this membership Operator
00:25 - Let me just ask you one question if I
00:28 - have a string suppose I have a string
00:30 - something like this I have Str a string
00:32 - is
00:35 - Jenny
00:37 - okay
00:38 - now in Python we can write double quote
00:41 - or single word if I want to check this y
00:44 - small Y is present in this string or not
00:47 - what we will do
00:49 - will that character is y we want to
00:52 - check this character is present or not
00:53 - right so one logic is what maybe we will
00:57 - compare this with every in a for loop
01:00 - with every character like is y equal to
01:02 - J no then e then compare with n n and
01:05 - then compare with Y yes Y is present
01:07 - then it will show yes
01:09 - so in a for Loop we'll write down this
01:11 - kind of logic right
01:13 - to check if this is present or not every
01:15 - character we have to check in a string
01:17 - but with the help of operator
01:20 - just to use one operator in Python and
01:23 - you can check this Y is present or not
01:25 - means we want to check why in this
01:28 - string
01:29 - is present or not Y in string
01:33 - yes
01:34 - so this checking this kind of thing we
01:37 - can do with the help of some operator
01:38 - that is known as membership operator in
01:41 - Python
01:42 - so there are basically two types of
01:44 - membership operator in and not
01:47 - in right so what we membership operators
01:50 - are used to check whether a character or
01:54 - a substring or a value or a variable is
01:59 - present in a sequence obviously this is
02:01 - a sequence of character
02:03 - in a sequence and sequence may be like a
02:06 - string or list or Tuple or dictionary or
02:10 - something like this set right although
02:13 - we haven't discussed like list
02:15 - dictionary Tuple and set but one example
02:17 - I'll take in this video Yeah string I
02:20 - hope you know what a string character of
02:22 - sequence of characters
02:24 - right so membership operator are
02:27 - basically used to check
02:29 - membership check for membership
02:32 - in a sequence membership of
02:34 - maybe a character or a substring or a
02:37 - value or a variable is present in a
02:39 - sequence or not right I hope you know I
02:43 - hope now you got what as basic use of
02:45 - these membership operator so two types
02:47 - of operators in and not in so in if I
02:51 - write something like this this is my
02:53 - string Jenny and I'm writing print
02:56 - and a character so that is why we use we
02:59 - will put this in single code Y in
03:03 - Str variable name is Str or directly we
03:07 - can say Y in
03:09 - gen directly we can write down this
03:11 - thing here right but we have taken a
03:13 - variable Str so Y in Str so this n
03:16 - operator will return in this case
03:19 - true
03:20 - because yeah small Y is present in this
03:23 - Str so in well return true if if
03:27 - that specified value is present in a
03:31 - sequence otherwise it will return false
03:34 - if I check here
03:37 - print
03:39 - n n y
03:41 - in Str so this is you can say a
03:44 - substring of this string n n y yes this
03:47 - is present so it will also return true
03:49 - if I write something like this print
03:52 - capital Y
03:54 - in Str this point of time it will it
03:57 - will return false because capital Y is
03:59 - not present in the string small Y is
04:01 - present right
04:02 - and what is knotting not in me uh if I
04:06 - write something like this let's
04:07 - understand this with example
04:10 - capital Y not in
04:14 - Str not in Str capital Y
04:18 - yeah capital Y is not in Str that is
04:21 - true
04:22 - yes capital Y is not in this string so
04:26 - it will return true
04:29 - so noting will work in a reverse manner
04:31 - of this in it will return true if the
04:35 - specified value specified character or
04:37 - the substring or the variable is not
04:39 - present
04:40 - in that sequence otherwise it will
04:43 - return false if I write something like
04:45 - this print small y
04:47 - or suppose I am checking e small e
04:51 - not in Str
04:54 - this point of time
04:55 - Small E not in Str but it is present so
04:59 - that is why it will return
05:02 - fourths
05:04 - right
05:06 - so these are membership operator and
05:08 - this is an example of string let's take
05:10 - example of let's take one more example
05:13 - list
05:14 - right in list we are having although we
05:17 - haven't discussed a list but we'll
05:19 - discuss that thing also suppose I am
05:21 - taking a list L and here in bracket I am
05:24 - taking 1 10 minus 1
05:26 - 0 17 some list of integers and I'm
05:31 - checking print
05:33 - 10 in this list now 10 don't need to put
05:36 - single quote because these are simple
05:38 - integer 10 in list in this list 10 is
05:42 - present yes it will return true
05:45 - if I write here print
05:48 - 10 not in l
05:52 - but 10 is in L and we are we are
05:55 - checking 10 not in L but it is present
05:58 - so it will return false
06:00 - right something like this so these
06:03 - operators these identity operator and
06:05 - membership operator we will use in later
06:08 - you know sections
06:10 - so this video is just to get you an idea
06:13 - about these membership operators and how
06:15 - to use these operators right so now
06:18 - let's see practical of these how to use
06:21 - these membership operators
06:22 - so let's create a new file here
06:30 - membership underscore operator Dot py
06:35 - right so
06:37 - first take a string Str is equal to I am
06:39 - taking suppose
06:41 - Jenny
06:43 - and khatri right J is capital n k is
06:47 - capital A and I'm let me just
06:52 - do this now I can I hope you can see
06:54 - this now print and I'm checking
06:57 - small J
06:59 - in Str
07:01 - right let's run this it will return
07:04 - false because capital J is present not
07:07 - small J if I write here
07:10 - capital j e n
07:13 - Str it's a we are checking a substring
07:16 - yeah it's present so it will turn true
07:18 - right if I write something like this j e
07:21 - n n y and
07:26 - foreign
07:30 - but it will return Folds
07:33 - see because Jenny khatri is having a
07:35 - space but here I'm checking with no
07:37 - space right if I write something like
07:39 - this
07:40 - now it will return to you right
07:43 - and if I write something like this like
07:47 - capital j
07:49 - and I'm writing
07:52 - not in Str so obviously it will return
07:55 - false because capital J is present in
07:57 - Str right so not in Str it will return
08:00 - if I print something like this if I if I
08:05 - check b b not in Str yes B is not in Str
08:08 - so it will return true it will return
08:11 - true right
08:13 - same for list if I check a list is L
08:16 - when L when I am taking 2 suppose 67 0
08:21 - minus 7
08:23 - 45 something like this right and if I
08:26 - check print
08:29 - 2 in L one
08:33 - no need to put single code because these
08:35 - are not string so 2 in L1 L1 yes it's
08:38 - true
08:39 - right and if I check 20 in L one
08:44 - it will return false
08:46 - right
08:47 - second one false right
08:50 - let's just comment this out
08:57 - and if I check here 20
09:00 - not in L one yeah it's true
09:03 - right and if I check
09:07 - minus 7 not in L1 but it will run false
09:11 - because it is present in L1 so I hope
09:13 - you got now the basic idea about
09:15 - membership operators right
09:17 - so I hope you got what are membership
09:19 - operators in Python so in the next video
09:21 - we'll discuss control structures in
09:24 - Python so now we'll see in the next
09:25 - video till then bye take care
