00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:01 - ca we are discussing printing pattern
00:03 - programs in c
00:04 - in this video i'll talk about how to
00:05 - print this pattern we'll see the
00:07 - logic here first of all in the
00:09 - whiteboard then i'll show you the output
00:10 - on my laptop using vs code editor right
00:12 - this is very simple to print don't just
00:15 - look at it and think it's very tough no
00:17 - let me clear out one thing it's very
00:18 - simple to print
00:20 - right how why i'm saying this see
00:23 - if you observe here then it is
00:26 - combination of
00:27 - two patterns which one
00:34 - this pattern is combination of one is
00:37 - this one
00:38 - this one right
00:42 - and one is this one inverted half
00:45 - parameter
00:46 - and one is this half pyramid combination
00:48 - of
00:49 - these two you combine this two will get
00:51 - this the only difference is what
00:53 - if we combine these two directly then
00:56 - two lines would be there having maximum
00:59 - number of
01:00 - stars here also five here also five
01:02 - right
01:03 - but here we have only one row having
01:05 - five stars having maximum number of
01:07 - stars
01:08 - right so you just have to change a
01:09 - little bit means
01:11 - combine the code of printing this
01:14 - pattern and this pattern
01:16 - and you have to change a little bit
01:18 - right
01:19 - because only one line we need having
01:21 - maximum number of stars
01:23 - fine now what change you do so first of
01:26 - all please watch out the videos
01:28 - that i have discussed printing this
01:29 - pyramid half pyramid and inverted half
01:31 - parameter
01:33 - i have discussed in detail because here
01:35 - i'll just simply write down the logic
01:37 - and we will discuss only the little
01:40 - change whatever you
01:41 - you need to do here right so please
01:43 - check out this video first
01:45 - i'll provide you the link of that
01:47 - playlist complete playlist
01:48 - see complete playlist in the description
01:50 - box of this video you can go and check
01:52 - out
01:53 - now let me just write down the code for
01:56 - this
01:56 - and this so now see this
01:59 - coding was to print this one
02:02 - the half pyramid right and from this
02:06 - to this this was to print this
02:09 - the inverted half parameter i have only
02:12 - changed a little bit here
02:13 - now i have initialized i is equal to
02:16 - number of rows
02:17 - minus 1 and i hope you got y i have done
02:20 - rows minus 1
02:21 - because here i want only one line having
02:24 - maximum number of
02:25 - stars so we will completely print this
02:28 - pyramid
02:30 - and this pyramid the inverted half
02:32 - pyramid we will print only these four
02:34 - lines
02:34 - not the line having maximum number of
02:38 - uh that stars that is why i have done
02:40 - rows minus one
02:43 - if we take number of rows five means
02:46 - this loop would be executed only four
02:47 - times and that is exactly we want only
02:49 - four lines if number of rows are 9
02:53 - then or you can say 10 then
02:57 - for this one we want 10 lines but from
03:00 - this inverted half pyramid we want only
03:02 - 9 lines we don't want
03:03 - the line having maximum number of stars
03:05 - right that is why ten minus one that is
03:08 - nine so this loop would be executed only
03:10 - nine times or
03:11 - uh if you have if you take five then
03:13 - four times only right
03:15 - now let me just run this one
03:19 - suppose number of rows you are entering
03:21 - before this you will write printf
03:23 - and number of rows using scanf you will
03:25 - take the value so number of rows i am
03:27 - taking
03:27 - five now pi is equal to one i would
03:30 - initialize with 1
03:31 - 1 less than equal to 5 yes condition 2
03:33 - enter here
03:34 - j is equal to 1 now j 1 less than equal
03:37 - to i
03:37 - i is 1 yes condition 3 will enter here
03:40 - and star would be printed
03:42 - this one 1 star would be printed right
03:45 - now j plus plus j is 2 is 2 less than
03:48 - equal to 1
03:49 - no condition not true exit from the loop
03:51 - slash n
03:52 - in the next line we are now right now i
03:56 - is equal to i plus plus i is 2 2 less
03:58 - than equal to 5 yes condition 2 again
04:00 - enter here and this would be
04:02 - step would be this step would be
04:03 - repeated right how many times
04:06 - till i value becomes 3 then 4 then 5 and
04:11 - 6 when i value becomes 6
04:13 - then this condition is not real will
04:15 - exit from the loop means five
04:16 - times means five lines would be printed
04:19 - one two three four
04:20 - five till this we are done
04:24 - now we have to print this pattern now
04:27 - exit from the loop because condition not
04:28 - true now after this loop we have
04:30 - these lines means we have another four
04:32 - nu
04:34 - now i was would be initialized with
04:37 - number of rows minus one number of rows
04:39 - five five minus one that is four
04:41 - 4 greater than equal to 1 yes condition
04:43 - true enter here j would be initialized
04:45 - with 1 1 less than equal to
04:46 - i is 4 yes condition 2 enter here and
04:49 - star would be printed
04:51 - right j plus plus j becomes 2
04:54 - 2 less than equal to four yes condition
04:56 - true again star would be printed now how
04:58 - many times star would be printed four
04:59 - times
05:00 - right when j value becomes five then we
05:03 - will exit from the loop means four star
05:05 - would be printed
05:06 - right that is why i have done rows minus
05:08 - one now i hope you got it
05:10 - all right now exit from the loop and
05:12 - slash n means
05:13 - we are into the next line now now i
05:15 - minus minus i becomes 3
05:17 - yes 3 greater than equal to 1 again
05:19 - enter here and this loop
05:20 - the this process would be repeated until
05:23 - i value becomes
05:24 - 0 then 2 then 1 then 0 when i value
05:28 - becomes 0 stop it
05:29 - and how many times this 2 would be
05:31 - executed 1 2 3 4 means 4 lines would be
05:33 - printed like this
05:35 - and that's it exactly you want this
05:36 - pattern right
05:39 - so now i hope you got it how to print
05:41 - this pattern
05:42 - now maybe you are thinking in the
05:43 - previous video i have told you first
05:45 - analyze the pattern how many number of
05:47 - lines like five
05:48 - six then seven eight then nine then
05:50 - divide it into number of columns and the
05:52 - outer loop would be from one to nine
05:54 - means from one to nine number of rows
05:56 - should be nine but here number of rows
05:58 - are five
05:58 - and we are able to print nine number of
06:00 - rows right
06:02 - so yeah you have to think a little bit
06:05 - in a different way
06:06 - maybe some pattern is combination of
06:09 - other patterns also we have discussed
06:11 - simple simple patterns
06:12 - right like this and this in previous
06:14 - video also i have discussed a pattern
06:16 - that was also combination of two pattern
06:18 - full pyramid and inverted full parameter
06:20 - right so you have to think now a little
06:23 - bit
06:23 - in a different way in the complicated
06:25 - you know that patterns
06:27 - these are generally combination of
06:29 - simple simple two or three patterns
06:31 - right so just combine the coding of
06:34 - those simple patterns and that's it
06:36 - that is why i was saying these printing
06:38 - of these patterns are very simple
06:40 - i hope you got it now now let me show
06:42 - you the output on my laptop
06:43 - so now let me create another file
06:47 - pattern 11 dot c
07:00 - and here we have to declare i j
07:04 - one variable is space and one is two for
07:06 - total number of rows
07:08 - right and we will ask from the user
07:12 - enter number of rows
07:18 - using scanf obviously we are going to
07:21 - take the input
07:28 - and now for loop
07:31 - for the first pattern i is equal to 1
07:35 - i less than equal to number of
07:38 - rows and i plus plus right
07:42 - now within this what j is equal to 1
07:47 - j less than equal to i and
07:50 - j plus plus and within this we will just
07:54 - print
07:56 - what star
07:59 - right and in the outer loop we have to
08:03 - print slashing
08:08 - now another that inverted half pyramid
08:10 - for that one also
08:12 - we have two we have to combine the
08:15 - coding right
08:16 - so one coding for this the half pyramid
08:19 - and this one is for inverted half gram
08:22 - so again i
08:23 - is equal to what rows minus 1
08:27 - and i should be greater than equal to 1
08:30 - here i minus minus
08:32 - right and within this
08:36 - another for loop j is equal to 1
08:40 - j less than equal to i and j plus plus
08:45 - and within this we are going to print
08:49 - star sorry not 8 its start
08:56 - and in the outer loop sorry note for
08:59 - loop we have to write down printf
09:02 - slashing right
09:08 - now that's it now let it should be
09:10 - number of
09:11 - its rows minus 1 right we are taking the
09:14 - variable name
09:15 - rows fine now let me just run this
09:24 - oh it's it should be printf where i have
09:27 - written this
09:28 - this is what printf
09:33 - sorry spelling mistake now again let me
09:36 - just run this
09:37 - now it is asking number of rows let's
09:39 - say 5
09:40 - and you are getting this pattern exactly
09:42 - i want this pattern right
09:44 - now let me just run this for 10 number
09:46 - of rows
09:48 - 10. and this pattern you want
09:53 - right so if you don't want to change
09:57 - into this loop what you can do
09:59 - you can change you can just simply put
10:01 - rows till 1
10:02 - and you can change into this for loop i
10:05 - till
10:06 - rows minus 1 that's it and now let me
10:09 - just run this
10:11 - for 5 number of rows and yeah exactly we
10:14 - are getting the
10:15 - same pattern right so now that's it for
10:17 - this video if you have any doubt you can
10:19 - ask me in comment box
10:21 - so now i'll see you in the next video
10:22 - with a new pattern till then bye bye
10:24 - take care
