00:00 - so in this video I'm going to answer a
00:01 - question that is what is the difference
00:03 - between coding and programming this has
00:06 - been asked by one of my student that man
00:08 - what is the difference between coding
00:09 - and programming and this question was
00:11 - also being asked in one of the interview
00:13 - also into sometimes interviewer also
00:15 - asked these type of questions the basic
00:17 - questions right it's not like that you
00:19 - have to deep dive into the difference of
00:22 - coding and programming right but you
00:25 - just have the knowledge of the you know
00:27 - basic difference between coding and
00:29 - programming right so I am going to tell
00:32 - you the basic difference with some
00:34 - real-life example or rather I would say
00:36 - you should understand the difference
00:38 - it's not like that
00:39 - just to mock up the definition from
00:41 - Google or any book that this is the
00:42 - difference is coding and this is
00:44 - programming you have to understand
00:46 - actually what is the difference the
00:48 - logic behind these two terms right so
00:51 - that when anyone or sometimes when
00:54 - interview or ask you these type of
00:55 - questions so you can explain with
00:56 - examples right they would appreciate the
01:00 - interviewer would appreciate your answer
01:02 - with real-life examples not just the
01:04 - difference just the definition or the
01:06 - bookish definition right so if we
01:10 - generally use these terms
01:12 - interchangeably means for us there is no
01:16 - difference between coding and
01:17 - programming both are same right
01:19 - sometimes we use coding sometimes we use
01:21 - programming right but yes there is a
01:24 - difference between these two terms right
01:26 - so first thing is what see obviously
01:31 - everybody is using some kind of remotes
01:34 - suppose you can say see remote or TV
01:37 - remote so when you use a TV remote in
01:40 - that case what happens when you have to
01:42 - change the channel you just do what you
01:45 - if you know the you know the numbering
01:47 - of the channel like 3 1 1 so just press
01:49 - 3 1 & 1 and that channel would be on
01:52 - your TV or if you just want to increase
01:54 - the volume just the up volume button if
01:56 - you just want to decrease the volume
01:58 - just press the decrease volume button
02:00 - right so this is what this is what
02:03 - programming means that remote has been
02:09 - programmed in such a way that it can
02:11 - accept the human inputs
02:13 - and it can synchronize those inputs with
02:17 - machine outputs with the outputs
02:19 - obviously we want that when we want to
02:22 - increase the volume or when we press the
02:24 - up volume button then the volume of TV
02:27 - should be increased right so that is
02:31 - what a programming but so everybody you
02:34 - can see everybody is using some kind of
02:36 - programming everybody is interacting
02:38 - with some kind of programming every day
02:41 - right but behind that what what happened
02:46 - behind that button that when you press
02:48 - that button then volume would be
02:49 - increased there would be some logic some
02:52 - code right it's not like that coding and
02:55 - programming is only specifically the
02:57 - terms for your C programming or when you
03:00 - write down the code on your laptop that
03:02 - complex code and the C programming C++
03:05 - Java and Python these kind of
03:07 - programming languages behind that button
03:10 - what can be a code may be some you know
03:12 - a memory unit may be there or switch can
03:15 - be there or maybe some you know passing
03:17 - of the voltage like a zero and one ended
03:20 - after that passing of that voltage that
03:22 - button is you know working that kind of
03:25 - so behind that thing there is some code
03:28 - there is some logic so that is what
03:31 - coding right and the complete
03:33 - functioning is what that is programming
03:36 - so you can say that programming is a
03:38 - broader term and coding is what coding
03:42 - is just a subset of programming right
03:47 - it's like you can say tree versus forest
03:51 - right so tree is what a subset of
03:53 - forests in forests I have many trees you
03:57 - can relate it something like this
03:59 - so coding is subset of programming fine
04:03 - or you can say that coding is what just
04:07 - translate the set of instructions into
04:11 - codes right down the codes or you can
04:13 - say just translate the set of
04:15 - instructions into a language that
04:18 - computer can understand or you can say
04:20 - machine can understand but programming
04:23 - is not just writing the course
04:27 - it includes coding plus many more
04:30 - activities like like let us take a
04:34 - simple example when you are building any
04:38 - project or suppose any app you are
04:40 - developing any app or you are developing
04:41 - any software right let us take a project
04:44 - you will get it better you are building
04:46 - any project you know working on a
04:49 - project in that case what will happen
04:50 - suppose a university management system
04:54 - you are making so there obviously first
04:57 - of all you have to plan what things you
04:59 - are going to include in that project
05:01 - write the requirements planning then you
05:05 - will design you will write down some
05:06 - algorithms some flowcharts right after
05:10 - that according to those specific
05:13 - requirements implementation would be
05:15 - there or coding would be there right so
05:17 - C coding is just a part right and after
05:21 - coding obviously we are going to test
05:22 - compile that implementation we are going
05:25 - to test it we are going to debug it and
05:27 - then we are going to you know deploy it
05:29 - obviously right like suppose I want that
05:33 - when I'm going to add a button when a
05:35 - new student comes register those
05:37 - students would be registered and that
05:39 - entry or the detail of that student
05:41 - would be placed in the database when we
05:43 - are going to fetch any student there
05:45 - would be a button you can fetch the
05:47 - details there would be specific you know
05:50 - that buttons or some functionalities for
05:54 - faculties as well for courses as well
05:56 - for departments as well right so first
06:01 - of all you you will think the outline of
06:02 - that thing the project fine the
06:06 - requirements then you are going to do
06:08 - the coding according to the specific
06:10 - requirements right so the complete
06:13 - project the fully functional product or
06:15 - the project that is what programming
06:18 - deals with and coding deals with you
06:22 - know only a simple part of the project
06:25 - or you can say simple part of the
06:27 - product right so here for coding what
06:32 - you need to do just the programming
06:35 - language or you can see the structure of
06:36 - the programming language the syntax of
06:38 - the programming language or how to write
06:39 - down the code right
06:41 - that programming language just that's it
06:45 - but for programming what you need to do
06:47 - because programming is broader sense in
06:50 - no it's not just the coding for
06:52 - implementation right you have some for
06:55 - programming that the programmer must
06:57 - have some analytical skills you are
06:58 - going to use some analytical tools also
07:01 - the implementation tools or many kind of
07:04 - tools right and that programmer should
07:07 - have the knowledge of the data structure
07:10 - and algorithm concept he is able to
07:12 - write down the complex algorithms he is
07:15 - able to you know solve the complex
07:17 - problems he is able to think how to
07:20 - solve those problems it's not like just
07:23 - writing the code you are just writing
07:24 - the code and you are program it suppose
07:26 - in in your you know a subject suppose
07:29 - you have C subject and in the lab you
07:32 - you are supposed to you know ask - you
07:34 - are asked to return a program like find
07:38 - out the number is palindrome or not and
07:39 - you have written the code means you are
07:41 - just doing coding it's not programming
07:44 - it's not that you are programmer now you
07:47 - are just coding but when you are making
07:49 - any project or any app development or
07:51 - software development and when you do all
07:53 - the kind of the things planning
07:56 - designing the requirement analysis and
07:58 - all implementation then testing
08:00 - compiling and all deployment and if you
08:04 - get the desired result that is known as
08:07 - programming right that is a programmer
08:11 - generally do so programmers are more you
08:15 - know you can say that expert then coders
08:17 - so generally you know when the junior
08:22 - you know the coders are considered as
08:24 - you can say junior software developer
08:26 - like this fine so what you can say that
08:29 - this coding is just the ability to
08:31 - understand the syntax and structure of
08:33 - the language just writing down the codes
08:35 - right or you can say processing the you
08:37 - know a process of writing the set of
08:39 - instructions into a language that a
08:41 - machine can understand but what
08:43 - programming and programming is just it's
08:45 - the ability to translate a thought or an
08:48 - idea into a language to solve a
08:51 - particular problem so you can say that
08:53 - coders are less X
08:55 - then programmers programmers are you
08:59 - know much more professional than coders
09:02 - so for coding the tools required you can
09:04 - say a text editor or you can say ID you
09:06 - have to just write down the code right
09:08 - that's it for this the core tools
09:11 - required are analyzing tools code
09:14 - generators where you can say modeling
09:16 - tools or you can say the testing
09:19 - frameworks as well as right so I think
09:21 - that's it for the basic difference
09:23 - between coding and programming these are
09:25 - very vague terms you know no need to
09:28 - worry about that you have to deep dive
09:30 - deep dive into the details of the
09:32 - difference between programming and
09:34 - coding just have the basic knowledge the
09:37 - basic difference what is the basic
09:39 - difference and that's it right so I
09:41 - guess that's it for this video now I am
09:43 - going to see in the next video till then
09:45 - nobody cares
09:54 - you
