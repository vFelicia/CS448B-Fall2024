00:00 - so in this video I'm going to discuss
00:02 - some tips for first-year and second-year
00:05 - students as well right because yesterday
00:08 - and I think day before yesterday I got
00:11 - some messages two or three messages from
00:13 - the students mum please give some tips
00:17 - for first-year students as well as in
00:18 - comment also I got a message I were to
00:21 - comment that please discuss some tips
00:23 - regarding first-year and second-year
00:24 - students right so say for first-year
00:27 - students basically maybe I have hundred
00:29 - off tips regarding you know category why
00:34 - study related tips general tips many
00:36 - kind of tips are there but in this video
00:39 - I am going to discuss some you know I
00:41 - thought very few important tips which
00:43 - are study and study related as well as
00:46 - general tips but both for first-year and
00:49 - second-year students remaining tips we
00:51 - will discuss in some other video right
00:54 - so see your primary goal to take
00:57 - admission is what to study and obviously
00:59 - ultimately to get a good job right so
01:02 - first episod you have to maintain your
01:05 - CDP from starting only from first
01:09 - semester only right it's not like that
01:10 - you have to maintain very good marks
01:12 - like 90 plus or 90% plus or 95% plus in
01:17 - every semester no but obviously in final
01:21 - year when you are going for any
01:22 - companies then they have some cutoff 60%
01:25 - 65% these kind of cutoff right so at
01:29 - least try to maintain your marks above
01:32 - that cutoff maybe I'll suggest above at
01:35 - least 65% marks should be there in every
01:39 - semester right and it's not a big deal
01:42 - it's not like that for these for the
01:45 - this percent is you have to study for 16
01:47 - hours 18 hours so 20 hours a day know at
01:50 - this point of time you are mature enough
01:52 - and you can easily score at least 65
01:56 - percent marks right just to have to take
01:59 - care of few things fine so first your
02:02 - primary focus is obviously to maintain
02:04 - your cgpm see it's your responsibility
02:06 - that you have to maintain a good CDP
02:09 - because when you are going suppose you
02:11 - get a job after that obviously it's
02:13 - responsibilities richer duty to perform
02:15 - well in the company right whether you
02:18 - are in a mood or you are not a good mood
02:20 - or whatever the things but the point is
02:24 - you have to perform there better right
02:26 - so they want a candidate that is
02:30 - obviously performing well in the CAD mix
02:33 - as well right I'm not saying that above
02:36 - 90% marks at least 65 plus or 60 plus
02:40 - marks right and that matters a load it's
02:44 - not like that your percentage is not
02:47 - going to matter right at least for
02:49 - getting your first job it is going to
02:51 - matter after that when you are going to
02:53 - switch in that is maybe it doesn't
02:56 - matter here I want to add one more point
02:59 - don't think that you are in the college
03:02 - just to take the classes to attend
03:04 - classes practical classes you just you
03:07 - know take the test assignments and
03:10 - midterms and the session ELLs and final
03:13 - exams and ultimately get a good job
03:16 - right yeah that is fine you are here to
03:20 - get a job but it's not just that thing
03:24 - right there there are many other
03:26 - opportunities in the college so you have
03:29 - to take advantage of every opportunity
03:32 - that is there in the college for you
03:34 - right and for that you have to learn how
03:38 - to manage time how to study obviously
03:40 - this is one primary thing right - at a
03:43 - job fine that is fine right you have to
03:46 - be knowledgeable right now you how to
03:49 - manage the time between study and other
03:51 - things right
03:53 - other things means what it's not like
03:56 - that
03:56 - I'm not saying that you have to be just
03:59 - a bookworm right and I'm not saying that
04:01 - don't study and go for other things
04:04 - right just have a balance of these two
04:07 - things right here other thing means no
04:12 - smoking and please no drinking at the
04:14 - time of your college because obviously
04:16 - maybe you have taken admission and you
04:19 - are free bird now first time you are you
04:22 - know out of you're out of your home and
04:25 - you have no one to put restrictions on
04:29 - you means you have not obviously you are
04:31 - staying in maybe in hostel or PG your
04:33 - parents are not there with you
04:35 - right so it's not like that you are a
04:36 - free bird and you'll do anything many of
04:39 - the students to these mistake that just
04:41 - to you know showcase or just to flaunt
04:43 - they start smoking or they smart you
04:46 - know they start drinking please don't do
04:49 - these kind of things just to look cool
04:51 - it's not at all cool it's very dangerous
04:54 - right plus no smoking no drinking plus
04:58 - you have to take care of your health as
05:00 - well right start a daily routine to take
05:04 - care of your health like maybe you can
05:07 - do some exercise at least for 15 minutes
05:09 - regularly in morning or some yoga some
05:12 - meditation or maybe some other kind of
05:16 - things or if you want to join a gym then
05:18 - you can go for it but you have to take
05:19 - care of your health as well make it as a
05:22 - habit right so in short you have to stay
05:26 - healthy as well right next is you have
05:29 - to improve other skills apart from
05:31 - studying like your soft skills maybe you
05:34 - can say your communication skills and
05:37 - suppose if you are not good in English
05:38 - speaking then focus on this thing also
05:40 - right if you need to join any English
05:43 - speaking course just go for it it's fine
05:45 - but you have to practice at your home as
05:47 - well or maybe at your hostel like for at
05:50 - your PG right so you have to improve
05:53 - this thing also and you have to improve
05:55 - your communication skills these two are
05:57 - different things means have confidently
06:00 - you have to boost up your confidence
06:02 - how confident Li you speak with other
06:03 - people your posture your body posture
06:06 - when you are speaking with other people
06:08 - when you are talking to other person
06:10 - just look at you know into the eyes of
06:12 - the other person don't hesitate don't be
06:15 - a shy type of person right try to
06:18 - overcome your you know a public speaking
06:21 - phobia or you can say stage 4 BIA right
06:24 - this is also very important right you
06:26 - have to develop that skill also because
06:28 - in first year obviously many students
06:30 - are having a stage fear like when it
06:33 - comes to the presentation part suppose a
06:35 - faculty asks you to give some
06:37 - presentation you will say that
06:39 - in addition and no no no I can't do this
06:41 - right because you will think that I'm
06:43 - not able to speak even how will I
06:45 - explain the topic what students will
06:47 - think about me no just forget what other
06:50 - people think about you just other
06:52 - students think about you just do your
06:54 - own work
06:55 - right you have to you have to polish
06:58 - yourself compare yourself with you only
07:02 - that yesterday it was you and today what
07:07 - you have improved in yourself right just
07:10 - focus on this thing just forget all
07:13 - other things that what other people
07:15 - other students will think about me right
07:18 - so whenever you have the opportunity to
07:21 - speak in public or to speak on stage
07:24 - just grab that opportunity whenever you
07:27 - grab you have the opportunity to you
07:29 - know give a presentation just go for it
07:31 - right without thinking about other
07:35 - people just go for it and make it as a
07:37 - habit definitely it is going to help you
07:40 - a load in your you know third year or
07:44 - final your after your graduation as well
07:47 - in your job as well right so you have to
07:49 - make it as a habit you have to develop
07:51 - these skills also right in your first
07:54 - year or if you are in second year then
07:56 - also you can start building these skills
07:58 - right next is you can work on your
08:02 - aptitude skills right this is also very
08:05 - important it's not like that just to get
08:07 - a job this is very important because I
08:10 - know just to get a job it is not you
08:13 - know it's not compulsory to start it
08:16 - from first year only
08:17 - but these skills will definitely going
08:19 - to help you in many things like
08:20 - obviously in placement if you are going
08:23 - for higher studies then if you go for
08:25 - gate exam then also for UCC exam UGC net
08:28 - exam then also for GRE exam for any
08:31 - government examinee banking exam or any
08:33 - civil examinations in every exam
08:36 - definitely it is going to help you the
08:39 - FT right so just regularly devote at
08:43 - least half an hour or one hour for your
08:45 - active skills next very important point
08:48 - is what many students do this mistake
08:51 - that
08:52 - if you are sitting in the classroom and
08:54 - if faculty is teaching something so try
08:56 - to understand try to complete that topic
08:59 - in classroom Oni suppose you have 15
09:02 - minutes of classroom 50 minutes class
09:05 - right and you have wasted your time just
09:08 - in you know you are not attentive in the
09:10 - class you haven't get anything of that
09:12 - lecture means you have wasted your 50
09:15 - minutes there right and time is very
09:17 - important here fine
09:19 - if you are in class if you are on bunk
09:22 - that is fine because obviously you have
09:24 - to you know feel everything you have to
09:27 - feel that college life it's not like
09:29 - that you have to attend all the classes
09:31 - right you you can take you can have bunk
09:34 - bunk also that is fine but if you are in
09:37 - class then be attentive and try to
09:40 - understand try to complete the topic in
09:42 - the classroom plus don't hesitate and
09:45 - please ask as many questions as you can
09:48 - to the faculty because you have paid for
09:50 - it right you are paying for it now fine
09:53 - so you have to utilize your money 100%
09:57 - utilization or else I would rather say
09:59 - more than 100 percent so try to you know
10:02 - cover up all the doubts try to clear all
10:05 - the doubts try to ask the question to
10:07 - the faculty don't think that yeah this
10:10 - is a silly type of questions if I would
10:12 - ask this question then students will
10:13 - laugh on me right I am NOT going to ask
10:16 - this I am going to study from the book
10:19 - and that is fine if you are not get many
10:21 - students do these kind of mistake if you
10:23 - are not getting anything what you will
10:25 - think I will cover the topic after the
10:28 - class or from the book book only I'm not
10:30 - going to ask any question from the
10:32 - faculty you are a shy type of person
10:34 - please don't do this thing right you
10:38 - have invested your 50 minutes there so
10:42 - try to invest your time don't waste your
10:44 - time right if I know it's impossible to
10:50 - understand 100% topic in the class
10:52 - because obviously I was one of you I
10:55 - have done BTech I was in first year and
10:57 - from my experience I am telling you
10:59 - these points right whatever mistakes I
11:02 - have done and
11:03 - now I think that I wish someone would
11:06 - have told me these points when I was in
11:09 - my first year right so this is
11:12 - definitely going to help you right maybe
11:15 - you have at least you have grabbed 50%
11:19 - of the topic that is also fine right if
11:23 - you haven't if you are not you are not
11:25 - attentive in the class
11:26 - you haven't get anything maybe after
11:29 - going home you try to study that topic
11:31 - right so maybe it will you know you will
11:34 - take more time to get that topic I am
11:37 - NOT saying that you are not going to get
11:38 - that topic maybe you are smart enough
11:40 - but it will take more time why you have
11:43 - this state you are 50 minutes there
11:44 - again 50 minutes or one hour at home
11:46 - only right and so please try to cover
11:51 - the topic in the classroom only sixth
11:55 - point is while understanding the topic
11:57 - in the class make notes with your hand
12:00 - with pen and paper because whatever you
12:03 - will write with pen and paper it will be
12:05 - in your mind for longer amount of time
12:08 - right if you will not revise the topic
12:11 - on the same day after the class it's
12:13 - fine when the exams will come obviously
12:16 - you will do that what last night fight
12:17 - so when you will read out your notes
12:20 - your hand made notes then definitely you
12:23 - will get in less time and better you
12:25 - will get rather than the book right so
12:28 - this is also very important try to make
12:30 - it as a habit right next I want to say
12:35 - that explore the college all the
12:37 - activities maybe in your college many
12:39 - clubs and activities are there so try to
12:41 - explore everything don't just stick to
12:44 - the classes only right don't just stick
12:47 - to the study only explore everything try
12:50 - to participate in other kind of events
12:53 - as well maybe cultural events also right
12:57 - like maybe in singing or dancing or
12:59 - painting or you know sketching or maybe
13:02 - to create best out of waste these kind
13:06 - of activities right always trying to
13:09 - participate in these kind of activities
13:10 - right it will boost up your confidence
13:14 - because when you will participate in any
13:16 - event or activity definitely you are
13:18 - going to open up you are going to
13:19 - interact with other classmates or other
13:21 - students so you are seniors or more with
13:24 - faculties right so it is going to help
13:27 - you definitely write try to open up
13:30 - always you know talk with your it's not
13:33 - like that don't just be a reserved type
13:35 - of you know student at the class let
13:39 - like I'm going to talk with two or three
13:41 - people or these five people we are not
13:43 - concerned with other classmates no don't
13:45 - do this thing try to explore the college
13:48 - everything in the college right or maybe

14:16 - Lucy type of thing just to get some good
14:20 - internal marks or these kind of things I
14:22 - hope you are getting my point
14:23 - but you have to get in touch with the
14:25 - faculties in a good way we can see it
14:28 - happens with many students that many
14:31 - faculties don't even know your name you
14:35 - know at the till at the end of the
14:37 - semester right that is not a good thing
14:39 - you are in college get in touch with
14:41 - your faculties share your ideas maybe
14:44 - regarding any study type of thing or
14:47 - anything or general ideas or maybe
