00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:02 - programming language in this video we'll
00:03 - talk about history of python in previous
00:05 - video we have talked about like some
00:07 - features of python why it is so popular
00:09 - and uh the application of python
00:11 - application areas in which areas python
00:13 - is being used these things we have
00:15 - discussed in this video we'll talk about
00:17 - the who is creator of python
00:19 - why he invented this why he created this
00:22 - when how where what is the motto behind
00:25 - designing of this language and the words
00:27 - and history of this language right all
00:29 - these things we'll talk about in this
00:30 - video so actually creator or you can say
00:33 - a designer of python languages it's he's
00:36 - a dutch programmer guido vandross
00:39 - he started working on this project in
00:41 - actually in 1989 during his christmas
00:45 - holidays
00:46 - right and at that time he was working in
00:48 - cwi centrum viscandi and informatica
00:51 - center at that time and on a project a
00:53 - distributed operating system ameba at
00:55 - that time he was working on that project
00:57 - and
00:59 - in his early 1980s he had worked on a
01:02 - programming language abc abc programming
01:05 - language so he was having some
01:06 - experience
01:07 - of working on a programming language or
01:10 - designing of a programming language like
01:12 - which factors for which you need to take
01:14 - care while you design a new language
01:15 - like some features and all these things
01:17 - so he was having some experience of this
01:19 - thing
01:21 - right so he had worked on the abc
01:22 - programming language and he was also
01:24 - working in sea also you know during the
01:28 - during his project of distributed
01:29 - operating system distributed operating
01:30 - operating system right
01:32 - so he was having some experience about
01:34 - this thing
01:35 - and
01:36 - so during you know in
01:38 - his christmas holidays as a hobby
01:40 - project he started working on this
01:42 - project on you can say designing of a
01:44 - new language
01:46 - so he took some features from abc
01:48 - programming language or you can say
01:50 - python is a successor of abc programming
01:53 - language you know he really liked some
01:56 - features of abc programming language and
01:58 - yeah there are some features i know he
02:01 - didn't like those features right
02:03 - but he took some features from that
02:05 - language and fix all the flows which was
02:08 - there in that language and added some
02:10 - new features and
02:11 - designed a new language
02:13 - within three months he had worked on
02:15 - this project with you know
02:17 - for three months only and he designed a
02:19 - new
02:20 - language so you can say new scripting
02:21 - language
02:23 - named python and why he named this
02:25 - language as python
02:27 - because
02:28 - at that time you know he was a fan of a
02:31 - british tv series named monty python's
02:34 - flying circus it was a comedy series
02:37 - right comedy series type of thing so
02:40 - that series is also known as monty
02:42 - pythons so he was fan of that thing so
02:45 - he took the name from
02:47 - that
02:48 - tv series python he wanted
02:51 - a new name unique name you know out of
02:54 - league name something different
02:56 - something different so he took that name
02:58 - python
02:59 - but python is not inspired from java
03:02 - many students think that like now object
03:04 - oriented programming concept the hoop
03:05 - concepts was taken from java no
03:08 - actually the idea of designing of python
03:10 - came up in 1989 and for java it was in
03:13 - 1995
03:14 - right so it's way before
03:16 - java it is taken from you can say he was
03:20 - having some experience of c language
03:21 - also then abc programming language as
03:23 - well as exceptional handling concept was
03:25 - not there in abc programming language
03:27 - and abc a language was not extensible
03:30 - you know they are not able to add new
03:34 - features in that programming language
03:36 - and during the working of
03:38 - working on projects you know
03:40 - he thought that he was you know facing
03:42 - some issues and all
03:44 - so
03:45 - it was not a he was not able to extend
03:48 - abc programming language new features
03:49 - were not added that is why he you know
03:52 - designed a new language and exceptional
03:54 - handling concept was taken the idea of
03:56 - this concept basically taken from
03:57 - modular language
03:59 - right
04:00 - so you can say python is inspired from
04:02 - abc as well as my modular language
04:05 - so he took some features from abc one
04:07 - feature from
04:08 - modular language by exception handling
04:11 - and designed a new scripting language
04:12 - and after three months
04:15 - he showed his work this kind of thing in
04:18 - you know his office and they started
04:20 - working even actually they started using
04:22 - that scripting language
04:24 - scripting language means
04:26 - just you can write down a script or some
04:28 - code to automate some task
04:31 - manually you don't need to do that task
04:33 - to automate some task of existing system
04:35 - you can you know write down a script a
04:37 - small script small code so they started
04:40 - using it they started you know doing
04:41 - improvement in that thing
04:44 - so uh
04:46 - in 1994
04:48 - primary discussion forum was formed for
04:51 - python
04:52 - and it was an open source project
04:55 - you know
04:56 - godo decided to keep it as open source
05:00 - so that anybody can use it and
05:02 - contribute in this source code just
05:05 - for its improvement right they can also
05:07 - add some features and all to improve
05:09 - that programming language
05:11 - and finally in 19 in feb 1991 first
05:14 - version was released that was known as
05:17 - 0.9.0
05:20 - having some features of like classes
05:23 - inheritance exceptional handling and
05:25 - some primitive like data types list
05:27 - dictionaries strings these things
05:30 - but official version of this the first
05:32 - version 1.0 was released in
05:35 - 1991.
05:38 - in 1991 1.0 official version was
05:41 - released with some extra features like
05:43 - lambda map reduce filter and then after
05:47 - that 1.1 1.2 like this still
05:50 - 1.6 updated version fixing of some flows
05:54 - and all added of new features and all
05:57 - then
05:58 - version 2.0 was released in
06:02 - 2000 following by the versions 2.1
06:05 - 2.3
06:06 - like this till 2.7 in 2010
06:11 - but they have announced that on january
06:15 - 1st of january 2020
06:17 - they have announced that
06:19 - they are going to end the support for
06:21 - this version 2.x version they are not
06:23 - going to support this version anymore
06:25 - right
06:26 - so now recently version is three point x
06:28 - version so basically first of all
06:30 - version 3.0 came into picture in 2008
06:34 - then 3.1 3.2 something like this
06:37 - and the latest version is 3.10 which was
06:41 - released in 2021
06:43 - so we are going to work on this version
06:45 - only the latest version 3.10. you will
06:48 - download this thing python 3.10
06:51 - right that will uh see next video how to
06:53 - install and set up everything to you
06:56 - know work on this language to write down
06:58 - programs
06:59 - and 3.11 will be released i guess in
07:02 - this this year only 2022 in october and
07:05 - next year future releases 3.12 in 2023
07:10 - so this is all about a small history of
07:12 - python that's all you need to take care
07:14 - basically who is designer of this
07:16 - language and we are in netherlands
07:19 - he was he is sorry
07:21 - he was not he is a dutch programmer he
07:24 - is still alive okay
07:26 - in netherlands he you know designed this
07:28 - language so that is all about history of
07:31 - python now in the next video we will in
07:33 - download python that interpreter and as
07:36 - well as the ide and we'll start using
07:39 - those things so now in the next video
07:41 - till then bye take care
