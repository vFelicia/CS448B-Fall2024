00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in this video I'll tell
00:04 - you some reasons or you can say we will
00:06 - try to uh figure out some points why
00:09 - most people fail to learn coding why
00:10 - they quit why they give up
00:13 - I'm sure you have seen some people or
00:15 - some students around you or maybe you
00:16 - are one of them at some point of time
00:18 - they are super excited Super inspired to
00:21 - learn coding and they even start
00:22 - learning coding but after few days they
00:24 - quit they give up they never make it why
00:27 - so it's not because they are not smart
00:29 - enough to learn coding over there they
00:30 - are not from computer science background
00:32 - it's because they have done some
00:34 - mistakes while learning coding so in
00:37 - this video same thing we are going to
00:39 - discuss what are those mistakes and how
00:41 - you can avoid those mistakes right but
00:45 - before going to those mistakes let me
00:47 - just tell you about a platform or you
00:49 - can say a job platform in India which
00:52 - focuses especially on software jobs and
00:55 - the name of that platform is to end and
00:58 - here they have 6000 plus onboarded
01:01 - companies means six thousands plus
01:03 - companies are hiring and already three
01:06 - lakh plus users are using this platform
01:10 - and you can apply on any kind of job
01:12 - from this platform

01:40 - designers of social media marketing for
01:43 - every category you will get here
01:44 - blockchain developer blockchain like
01:47 - machine learning engineers and
01:48 - internship as well as for jobs you will
01:50 - get every detail like this for
01:52 - internship it's a Stipe fund duration
01:54 - start date position for job you will get

02:14 - means from one platform only you can
02:15 - apply for any kind of job and this job
02:17 - section or the internship section or job
02:19 - section is absolutely free now all the
02:22 - relevant links and details you will find
02:23 - in the description box of this video you
02:25 - can go and check out so the first
02:27 - mistake is you stuck into the tutorial
02:29 - track I'm assuming that you have spent
02:33 - enough time to search like which
02:34 - language is good which course is good
02:37 - and all and you have start learning you
02:39 - have started learning
02:40 - going for that course or started
02:42 - learning coding right now we are
02:43 - watching the tutorial you have chosen a
02:45 - course now you are watching those
02:47 - tutorials right now maybe you have spent
02:50 - your 50 hours or 100 hours watching that
02:52 - tutorial and now you are starting
02:55 - to code right means you are starting you
02:58 - you have started using those practice
03:00 - sites like maybe codewords or any
03:02 - practice site and you are not able to
03:04 - solve a simple problem why so because
03:08 - you are just learning from the tutorials
03:11 - you haven't practiced yet
03:13 - right
03:15 - so now again if you are stuck you again
03:17 - start watching those tutorials and all
03:19 - so you are now stuck into that tutorial
03:20 - track
03:22 - okay learn basic things to any part is
03:24 - also important learn the basic things
03:26 - and start applying that knowledge start
03:29 - working on projects start working simple
03:32 - working on you know start making simple
03:34 - projects simple applications very simple
03:37 - that's okay it's not like that you have
03:40 - to go to the higher level project at
03:42 - first no start making simple project
03:45 - whatever knowledge you have right now
03:46 - use that knowledge
03:49 - practice coding start coding don't just
03:52 - watch that tutorial only just sit and
03:55 - watch the tutorial and that is like a
03:58 - fake progress in your mind yeah you are
04:00 - learning coding
04:01 - but you are still a
04:03 - baby
04:05 - if you have watched that 100 hours of
04:08 - code that tutorial but you haven't
04:10 - practiced yet means you are still a baby
04:12 - in learning coding
04:15 - right so do Active Learning not just
04:18 - passive learning
04:20 - and those who do this kind of thing
04:23 - that passive learning just stuck in the
04:25 - tutorial wrap definitely after some time
04:28 - they are going to give up
04:30 - because they are not able to solve the
04:32 - problem they haven't practiced
04:34 - so they think that like I have watched
04:37 - this the complete course and still are
04:39 - not able to solve the problem
04:42 - so that is going to demotivate you and
04:45 - you will give up
04:47 - so do not just you know go into this
04:50 - tutorial trap start practicing with
04:53 - tutorial learn Basics things and start
04:56 - working on projects parallel
04:58 - right
05:00 - like maybe you have start learning
05:01 - coding start basic concept learn basic
05:04 - concept and then go to the practice
05:05 - sites there are many practice sites
05:07 - start practicing questions from that
05:09 - side then next concept then questions
05:12 - for that concept and then also work on
05:15 - Project as well right and one more
05:18 - reason why most of the people stuck in
05:20 - this tutorial trap is what because they
05:23 - take long breaks
05:25 - from coding like three days five days
05:28 - seven days or even months and once after
05:31 - months like after one month they start
05:34 - again from from you know they are going
05:36 - to start learning coding from where they
05:38 - have left then they are they are going
05:41 - to blank definitely because you have
05:43 - taken a long break you are not
05:45 - consistent so again you will watch the
05:47 - tutorials and all that's it so that is
05:50 - why you are again going to try going to
05:52 - stuff into this tutorial track
05:55 - so be consistent do not take long breaks
05:58 - okay one day break two day break is fine
06:01 - but try to avoid even one day break
06:05 - practice
06:06 - for 15 minutes or 20 minutes or 30
06:08 - minutes at least
06:10 - if you are not going to devote like one
06:12 - hour to R2 for practicing questions
06:15 - right so at least 30 minutes or 15
06:17 - minutes but do not take long dates
06:21 - right now second mistake is not finding
06:24 - out your niche
06:26 - now generally many people say that just
06:29 - focus on the general programming Concept
06:31 - in college as well they focus on the
06:33 - general programming concept like in
06:35 - every semester the C then C plus plus
06:37 - then Java then maybe python then data
06:40 - structure concept as well as algorithm
06:41 - concept but they just focus on the basic
06:43 - things General things they are not going
06:45 - to deep down
06:47 - into that thing
06:48 - right so you have to find out your niche
06:53 - okay like if you have some people do
06:57 - like what they are they have done a Java
06:59 - course now they don't know what to do
07:01 - next because they are not having a
07:03 - bigger picture
07:04 - right they haven't decided their niche
07:08 - they are still a newbie
07:11 - so that is that is the second reason and
07:14 - that is I think the most underestimated
07:17 - reason because everyone will say that
07:21 - just focus on General concept
07:23 - programming concept and that is fine do
07:25 - not go into deep and do not go in a
07:27 - specialist type of thing but I think
07:31 - which the important thing is you have to
07:34 - find out a niche that like if you are
07:37 - going for python or JavaScript like if
07:39 - you are going for python don't just be a
07:41 - python developer like go for Django
07:44 - Django specialist
07:46 - so rather than mentioning like three or
07:49 - five or seven uh you know programming
07:52 - languages in your resume
07:54 - just mention one or two but you have to
07:57 - be expert of into that programming
08:00 - language you have to be expert using
08:02 - Frameworks in those programming language
08:04 - you have to be expert you have like you
08:06 - have developed some projects using those
08:08 - Frameworks and those uh programming
08:10 - languages so like if you are going for
08:12 - JavaScript then deep down you can go for
08:15 - react.js you have idea of react JS you
08:17 - have developed you have used that thing
08:19 - in your project and you are exporting
08:21 - that thing using maybe node.js and next
08:23 - to JS like this so this is what finding
08:25 - out the niche and going deep down into
08:28 - that thing and become an expert rather
08:30 - than just doing multiple things at a
08:33 - time all the languages and not even know
08:36 - the you know any one language properly
08:39 - right so that is the second mistake
08:43 - third is you are doing it alone
08:46 - right so better to join some Community
08:49 - if you are learning coding better to
08:51 - join some Community there are free uh
08:54 - you know Forum also like you can join
08:56 - the stack Overflow Reddit many others
08:59 - are there many other free communities
09:00 - are there you can join them definitely
09:03 - there they'll post some questions answer
09:05 - and then go they are going to help you
09:07 - can post your question you will get
09:08 - answer from experts
09:10 - and if something like this you can do
09:14 - like you can join any paid course which
09:16 - is having a strong group a strong
09:19 - Community right
09:21 - so there that is going to help you
09:23 - definitely because you can ask your
09:24 - question you can discuss you can share
09:26 - ideas and they are going to definitely
09:27 - motivate you and all or maybe you can
09:30 - work with your friends from the same
09:32 - project you can share ideas with them
09:34 - and you can motivate each other
09:36 - so it's better to work it's better to
09:39 - work on Project or better to work better
09:41 - to learn coding in groups better to join
09:43 - communities rather than doing it alone
09:46 - because maybe sometime you will stuck
09:48 - somewhere and you will feel lonely and
09:50 - no is going you know nobody is there to
09:51 - motivate you and maybe you will quit
09:55 - right
09:56 - but there are some exceptional cases
09:59 - also those who love to work alone maybe
10:03 - so if you are one of them you can do it
10:06 - okay the next mistake is you
10:08 - underestimate the theory part
10:11 - because generally do generally what
10:13 - everyone says while it comes to learning
10:17 - coding then practice practice so you
10:19 - think that theory part is not important
10:23 - is also important do not underestimate
10:26 - the query part the concept the knowledge
10:28 - right
10:30 - I am saying do not underestimate that
10:32 - thing
10:34 - do not just only focus on theory part
10:37 - but focus on query part
10:40 - right like learn concept practice
10:43 - questions if you are stuck somewhere
10:45 - again revise that concept
10:48 - right do not just think I have done that
10:51 - concept I am still not able to solve
10:53 - that problem it's okay it happens with
10:54 - everyone just revise that concept that
10:56 - thing again and try to solve the problem
10:59 - knowledge
11:07 - now fifth reason last but not the least
11:09 - is people usually get scared of failures
11:12 - and errors
11:13 - right you are afraid of
11:16 - errors you get for the failures maybe
11:19 - you think that you you are not able to
11:21 - make it do not be so hard to yourself
11:24 - give yourself enough time to learn to
11:27 - fail and grow that happens with everyone
11:31 - no one is perfect everyone is failing
11:35 - and learning and then growing so give
11:37 - yourself this
11:38 - this cycle or this you know time
11:41 - remember why you have started this thing
11:44 - why and if you have started this thing
11:47 - like the law encoding and programming
11:49 - it's because everyone is doing this and
11:52 - you will get good salary and good salary
11:53 - package and a good job and all
11:56 - so learning coding or learning any
11:59 - programming language basic things is not
12:01 - that much stuff
12:02 - but
12:05 - becoming an expert in that thing
12:08 - need fashion
12:10 - patience time so if you have started
12:13 - learning coding because everyone is
12:14 - doing or just to get a good good job and
12:17 - all then you have to think again but if
12:20 - you are really passionate about learning
12:22 - coding then definitely it is for you
12:24 - definitely will not give up
12:26 - in spite of many failures and errors and
12:29 - all so I think these five are some
12:32 - common mistakes generally you know
12:35 - people or student do while learning
12:36 - coding and they give up if you think
12:39 - that you have done you are one of them
12:41 - and you have done some other mistake or
12:43 - there may be some other mistakes
12:45 - generally beginners can do then you can
12:46 - write on that thing in comment section
12:48 - right so now once in the next video till
12:50 - then bye bye take care
