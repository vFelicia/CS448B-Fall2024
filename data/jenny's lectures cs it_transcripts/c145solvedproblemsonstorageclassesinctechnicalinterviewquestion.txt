00:00 - so we are done with the types of storage
00:01 - classes in C now I have got some
00:03 - questions from students based on stories
00:05 - classes like some Theory questions also
00:07 - there and some code is given and you are
00:09 - supposed to find out output of that uh
00:11 - code in C programming right so those
00:13 - three questions we are going to discuss
00:15 - in this video right we'll explain I'm
00:17 - going to explain the solution also like
00:19 - step by step why you are getting that
00:21 - kind of output if any error is there in
00:23 - that program why that error is there
00:25 - right everything about those questions
00:27 - we are going to discuss in this video
00:29 - now let's see first question is this one
00:31 - here I haven't used any I haven't used
00:34 - any storage class so we have a global
00:36 - variable this is a global variable right
00:39 - and in main I'm just printing this value
00:41 - of a in return zero now I have told you
00:43 - by default if you have written this
00:46 - things and by default the storage class
00:47 - would be considered as
00:50 - oo right but second point I have also
00:53 - told you like we cannot write something
00:56 - like this Auto in a the global
00:58 - declaration Auto is Auto we can use this
01:01 - uh storage class this keyword we can use
01:03 - only with local variables no Global
01:05 - declaration is allowed only local
01:06 - declaration is allowed right so now what
01:10 - first of all what should be the value
01:12 - and and second question is under which
01:14 - storage class this Global variable comes
01:18 - right so now the first of all the answer
01:20 - of this question would be zero output of
01:22 - this uh code would be Zero by default
01:25 - Global variables have to be assigned
01:27 - with the zero value right and second
01:30 - answer of second question is the global
01:32 - variable comes under which
01:34 - category extern storage class and we
01:37 - were discussing extern storage class at
01:39 - that time I have told you the default
01:41 - value for extern storage class this know
01:44 - variable would be zero so that Global
01:46 - variable also having value zero so these
01:49 - are not coming under oo right these are
01:52 - coming under xter so I hope now you got
01:55 - the answer of these two questions right
01:58 - now next question is
02:00 - okay this is the second
02:02 - question here we are using static
02:05 - storage class right so first of all the
02:08 - program the control will go to main
02:10 - function whenever you will run that code
02:13 - then here we have four Loop now first of
02:16 - all first statement is initialization
02:18 - then condition check then the updation
02:20 - increment or decrement right but in and
02:23 - here all the three places we have are
02:25 - calling Fun function it's okay that is
02:27 - correct no problem what whatever is
02:30 - written just follow those steps right
02:33 - now first is initialization first
02:35 - control will go here now here we are
02:37 - calling Fun function so control will go
02:40 - here this is definition of fun now here
02:44 - we have a variable static in Num Num
02:48 - value is 16 now it is static this
02:51 - keyword this is very important you have
02:53 - to keep in mind the property of this
02:56 - static keyword right it will retain its
02:58 - previous value right scope is local but
03:02 - lifetime of this variable is till the
03:04 - end of the program fine now return num
03:07 - minus minus now first of all it is post
03:10 - decrement so it will return the previous
03:12 - value first and then it is going to
03:14 - decrement it is post not pre so it will
03:17 - return 16 first return num 16 would be
03:20 - returned Here and Now 16 becomes
03:24 - 15 right minus
03:27 - minus next is condition would be checked
03:29 - but but at the place of condition also
03:31 - we are calling the function so again
03:32 - control will go
03:34 - here now this statement static in Num is
03:37 - equal to 16 again it would would be
03:39 - initialized no right because this is
03:43 - static here we are using static so this
03:44 - would be ignored it will rain its
03:46 - previous value that is 15
03:48 - only this is the tricky part in this
03:50 - question that's it nothing else now 15
03:53 - only no not again not be initialized
03:55 - with 16 so it is now 15 now return num
03:59 - so 15 would be returned Here and Now
04:01 - become now minus minus so it becomes now
04:04 - 14 after returning the original value
04:07 - now the condition is 15 it means it's
04:10 - not zero means it's
04:12 - true 0 is only false other than zero
04:15 - it's true so if it is true we are going
04:17 - to enter into this for Loop now here we
04:19 - have one condition print F again we are
04:21 - calling function it's okay again control
04:23 - will go here this would not be
04:25 - initialized again so it will return the
04:27 - previous value that is 14 first here 14
04:29 - 14 would be returned and now value
04:31 - becomes 13 so first of all output would
04:34 - be 14 would be printed right now next
04:37 - step is we'll go to this part update
04:40 - part but here also no increment
04:42 - decrement we are calling the function
04:43 - again so it's okay again we are will
04:45 - call the function now again the previous
04:48 - value is 13 so it will return first of
04:50 - all 13 here and then value becomes 12
04:54 - minus- right now after update we will
04:58 - again check the condition
05:01 - right now for checking the condition we
05:04 - the control will come here so function
05:07 - calling it's okay again we'll call this
05:09 - function now it will return here the
05:11 - previous value of num that is 12 and now
05:14 - it becomes 11 minus- so 12 is what also
05:17 - not zero it's true so we are going to
05:20 - enter into this loop again we will call
05:23 - the function fun right and now this time
05:26 - 11 would be returned 11 so 11 would be
05:29 - printed and value becomes 10
05:32 - minus- after returning the previous
05:34 - value now minus minus means it would be
05:37 - one
05:38 - decremented now after printing here 11
05:42 - now value becomes 10 so now the part is
05:46 - this part so here we are again calling
05:48 - the function so now 10 value would be
05:50 - returned and now value becomes
05:52 - n now after this we will check the
05:55 - condition again but for checking the
05:57 - condition again we will call the
05:58 - function now here 9 would be returned
06:01 - and value becomes now 8 so condition 9
06:04 - is true not zero okay we'll enter into
06:07 - this loop again we will call the
06:08 - function now eight would be return so
06:10 - eight would be printed and now value
06:11 - becomes
06:13 - seven right now after this here again
06:17 - we'll call the function from here right
06:19 - and this time 7 would be returned and
06:21 - value becomes six now we'll check the
06:24 - condition here again we'll call the
06:27 - function so six would be returned and
06:30 - value becomes five six is not zero so
06:33 - it's true again we'll enter into this
06:35 - for Loop and fun we'll call the fun
06:37 - function again so now this time five
06:39 - would be returned so five would be
06:40 - printed and value becomes four minus
06:44 - minus right now here increment decrement
06:48 - part update part so here again we are we
06:50 - will call the function now four would be
06:53 - returned and value becomes three now
06:56 - we'll check the condition so we'll call
06:58 - the function again
07:00 - now three would be returned here and
07:02 - value becomes two right now three is
07:05 - true yes we will enter into this Loop
07:07 - now at this
07:09 - time two would be returned we are
07:11 - calling the function again so two would
07:13 - be returned and this becomes one now
07:17 - again this part so again we'll call the
07:19 - function so here now one would be
07:20 - returned and value becomes zero now
07:22 - we'll check the condition again now
07:24 - again we will call the function and now
07:26 - this time zero would be returned and
07:28 - this becomes minus one so
07:30 - this is what condition so if this is
07:32 - true only this is true then only we will
07:35 - enter into this Loop zero means false so
07:37 - now we are not going to enter into this
07:39 - Loop so now return zero exit from the
07:41 - loop so what output you will get this
07:43 - one 14 11 852 I hope you got this
07:46 - working of this one
07:49 - right these type of questions generally
07:51 - you get in competitive exam in Gate or
07:54 - net right those are having this static
07:57 - keyword so you have to you know remember
08:00 - the property of the static keyword right
08:03 - so we are having two more question but
08:05 - that those question we will discuss in
08:06 - next video if you have any question like
08:08 - you think this is complicated one I'm
08:10 - not getting the answer of this question
08:12 - or answer you are getting but you are
08:13 - not getting the reason of getting that
08:15 - type of answer or error based on storage
08:18 - class or based on anything any topic on
08:20 - C language then you can tell me in
08:22 - comment box you can just send me that
08:24 - you know question or you can send me
08:25 - that question screenshot of screenshot
08:27 - of that question on my Instagram account
08:29 - you can message me I'm I'll try to
08:31 - upload a video on that question also
08:34 - right now I'll see you in the next video
08:36 - till then bye-bye take care wait if you
08:39 - think that any topic is left in C
08:41 - programming then you then also you can
08:42 - tell me in comment box I'll try to
08:44 - upload video on that topic also but from
08:47 - my side I guess I have completed C
08:49 - programming so now I'll see you in the
08:51 - next video till then bye-bye take care
