00:00 - so the next question is construct a
00:02 - binary tree from the even post order and
00:04 - in order traversal fine
00:07 - okay post order traversal is what left
00:11 - right and then root and in all it is
00:16 - left root end right now first at first
00:22 - step is to find out the root of our
00:25 - binary tree how to find out the root
00:27 - fine from in order traversal you can't
00:29 - find out route because root is in
00:31 - between left on left alright we can't
00:33 - say what is the root in this inorder
00:37 - traversal fine but from post order we
00:40 - can say which one is route how
00:42 - because root root is always in the last
00:44 - position so pre-order may have nakata we
00:48 - have scanned the preorder traversal from
00:50 - left to right but in post order
00:52 - traversal you will scan this traversal
00:55 - from right to left
00:57 - starting element is 8 now 8 would be
01:02 - root over binary tree now find out they
01:07 - living to the left of this 8 and the
01:09 - element which are to the right of this 8
01:11 - left subtree element of left subtree and
01:13 - element of right subtree fine how to
01:17 - find out this left and right subtree
01:19 - will go to the inorder traversal now
01:21 - locate this 8 here we have this 8 this
01:25 - one is our root root root key left and
01:30 - we have left left and root K like me
01:33 - right make your gob na right element so
01:35 - you can say the right path fine
01:37 - so all the elements to the left of this
01:39 - root these are the elements of left
01:43 - subtree and these are elements of right
01:46 - subtree fine element of left subtree are
01:49 - nine five one seven two and twelve right
01:57 - and the element of right subtree are
01:59 - four three and eleven okay now construct
02:04 - this left subtree now see out of these
02:08 - elements which would be the root have to
02:10 - find out and we can find out
02:13 - the root element from postorder only
02:15 - right and second condition is you are
02:17 - supposed to scan this post order from
02:19 - right to left now the condition to find
02:22 - out this root is out of these elements
02:25 - see out of these elements the elements
02:28 - which is coming first when you scan this
02:31 - traversal from right to left
02:33 - that would be the first element would be
02:36 - the root out of nine five one seven two
02:39 - and twelve which element is coming first
02:41 - when you scan this find out for no.4 is
02:46 - that right part 11 is also right part
02:48 - three is also in the right part five
02:51 - when you scan from right to left the
02:54 - first element found is five out of these
02:57 - elements we are not considering these
02:59 - elements fine five could be the first
03:02 - then five would be root of this left
03:07 - subtree now find out left and right part
03:11 - of this five how to find out your go-to
03:13 - you know locate this five in this in
03:16 - order here we have fine now out of these
03:21 - element nine is to the left of five the
03:24 - right this 9 to the left of five and one
03:27 - seven two and twelve 1 7 2 n 2 well
03:34 - would form the right subtree of this
03:37 - fine fine now find out out of these
03:41 - element which would be the root the same
03:43 - step we would go to the post order scan
03:46 - this post order from right to left which
03:48 - is element is coming first we have 7 out
03:53 - of these elements fine
03:55 - 7 is coming first when you scan this
03:57 - from right to left now 7 would be the
04:01 - root of this right subtree of this 5 now
04:05 - find out the left element of the 7 and
04:09 - what does the right soil or you can say
04:11 - the right subtree of this same locate
04:14 - the 7 into this in order here we have 7
04:18 - and out of these elements find out one
04:22 - is to the left of 7 so you will write 1
04:24 - here fine
04:26 - and two and twelve are to the right of
04:29 - the seven fine so you'll write two and
04:33 - 2n here now we have two elements again
04:39 - find out the root out of this two and
04:41 - twelve find out the root again scan this
04:43 - post order traversal from right to left
04:45 - and out of this to n2l which one is
04:48 - coming first this 2l is coming first two
04:51 - is after two when you will go from right
04:54 - to left well is coming first so 12 would
04:56 - be the root now find out left or right
05:00 - left or right tonight here to help me
05:02 - pass away only one element so either it
05:03 - would be the left part either or to the
05:06 - right part fine
05:07 - so to find out this we have to locate
05:10 - this 2l in this in order to ever sell
05:12 - now find out two is to the left of this
05:15 - 12 fine to the left of root part so two
05:20 - would be to the left of this now we are
05:24 - done with the left subtree now go to
05:27 - this right subtree now out of these
05:30 - element which would be the root out of
05:31 - four three and eleven would find out
05:33 - clinically the same step we would go to
05:35 - the post order traversal we will scan
05:37 - this from right to left and find out
05:39 - which element is coming first out of
05:40 - four three and eleven four is coming
05:43 - first
05:43 - fine then four would be the root now
05:48 - find out the left hand right part of
05:52 - this for to find out left and right we
05:56 - would go to the inorder traversal locate
05:58 - this 4 in inorder traversal here we have
06:01 - this four fine and out of this element a
06:05 - remaining element 3 and 11 both 3 and 11
06:07 - are right of this root C root K can
06:11 - write me the left may appear root K
06:14 - there would be nothing and 4 and 13 both
06:17 - are to the right of this for now here we
06:21 - have sorry 3 and 11 Hill 311 would be to
06:29 - the right of this for now top 3 and 11
06:31 - find out which would be the root again
06:33 - scan this post order traversal and 11 is
06:38 - coming first
06:39 - so 11 would be the route now see what we
06:41 - left or right how to find out go to this
06:44 - in order traversal locate this 11 here
06:46 - we have this 11 and 3 is 11 is a route
06:49 - fine and 3 is to the left of this 11
06:53 - fine so 3 would be to the left of this
06:59 - 11 right so now we are done with our
07:04 - binary tree fine this is a row by
07:07 - negative from this post or an inorder
07:09 - traversal if you want to verify it then
07:11 - you can find out post order and inorder
07:13 - traversal of this tree without you know
07:16 - checking without checking these 1 and if
07:20 - the post order and inorder traversal of
07:22 - this tree is same as given in this
07:24 - question then you can say it's all right
07:28 - binary tree ok so I'll see you in the
07:31 - next video till then bye-bye take
