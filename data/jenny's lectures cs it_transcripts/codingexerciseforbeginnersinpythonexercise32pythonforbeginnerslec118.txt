00:01 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:04 - bth and programming language we are
00:05 - discussing total Graphics right almost
00:08 - we have done all the basics of turtle
00:10 - Graphics right with three or four coding
00:13 - exercises now one more coding exercise
00:15 - we'll see in this video and this would
00:17 - be I think the last video of the this
00:21 - concept Turtle Graphics right okay now
00:23 - what you have to draw let me just show
00:25 - you first so this is the thing we want
00:28 - see I hope you can see now these dots
00:32 - tiny dots Circle type it's not Circle
00:35 - actually but these are dots so having
00:38 - different different colors and randomly
00:40 - the uh turtle is moving in any direction
00:43 - I don't know anywhere and it's just
00:46 - painting something like this like
00:49 - putting the dot to that position
00:51 - randomly anywhere with random colors
00:55 - right so this thing you need to draw for
00:59 - that obv you need to uh refer the python
01:02 - documentation because let me just tell
01:04 - you to draw these dots these dots you
01:08 - can say filled Circle small circle there
01:11 - is a proper method here that is do do
01:15 - right so go to python documentation and
01:17 - check out what is that do method how to
01:19 - use that right what you have to do now
01:22 - the colors have to choose randomly first
01:26 - I hope you have heard uh that H painting
01:30 - about this thing let me just show you
01:32 - there's one artist Damian Hurst and if
01:35 - you search in Google like hurst.
01:36 - painting then you will see many
01:39 - paintings here right so actually there
01:41 - is a proper website rc.net there these
01:44 - paintings are you can you can actually
01:46 - uh buy these paintings so you can just
01:50 - save any image in do jpg and you can
01:54 - extract colors from these pictures that
01:58 - thing we have discussed in previous
01:59 - video you have to extract RGB values
02:02 - from the image using colorr package
02:05 - right so extract these colors and then
02:08 - use these colors for your this project
02:11 - for your this exercise right so this
02:14 - kind of thing we are going to draw like
02:17 - randomly anywhere obviously not exactly
02:19 - something like this but yeah we will try
02:21 - to draw something like this
02:23 - only I see for this painting the price
02:25 - is this
02:27 - one this much US dollar pause the video
02:30 - and now try this out so I hope you have
02:33 - done this so let's create a new file in
02:35 - the turtle project named like doore
02:38 - painting. py we'll Import in this case
02:41 - Turtle class on screen class and let's
02:44 - create a
02:46 - turtle just name of the turtle then name
02:48 - of the class and let's create a screen
02:50 - also a screen object without creating
02:54 - screen object also you can uh you know
02:57 - do this but if you want to check out the
02:59 - screen screen size that also we I'll
03:01 - show you in this video and at last
03:03 - obviously you have to do to hold the
03:06 - screen for do exit on click right
03:09 - now if you want to check out the screen
03:12 - size then we have a method screen size
03:16 - okay you can just print
03:21 - this print screen
03:27 - size and see the screen sizes 400 300
03:31 - 400 by 300 right okay now how to draw
03:35 - the dot see I have told you in Python
03:38 - documentation we have like a this dot
03:43 - method total do dot so you have to give
03:45 - size and the color if you want to give
03:47 - you can just give the color also right
03:50 - Turtle dot
03:52 - dot right just give the size of that do
03:57 - right color also you can give
04:00 - that is also fine but we will not give
04:02 - the
04:03 - color we just give the size so Tom dot
04:07 - dot and just give the size to
04:10 - 20 right now let's run this on the
04:14 - screen you will get one do that is in
04:16 - black color by default right now I want
04:19 - to move the to to any location randomly
04:23 - if you want to move then we have one
04:25 - method go to or set position these kind
04:28 - of thing okay this thing I have shown
04:30 - you in previous videos so you can give
04:32 - to the the x and y coordinate so if I
04:35 - give like 100
04:38 - 100 now let's run this and see
04:43 - after this to creating this do now our
04:45 - turtle is at this location because this
04:48 - location is 0 0 so 100 to xais 100 to Y
04:52 - AIS so here here we have 100 100 so now
04:56 - here also I want to draw a DOT then
04:58 - again I want to move my
05:00 - this Turtle to any other location and
05:02 - there also a DOT then other location
05:04 - then there also a dot but these dots are
05:07 - also colorful so randomly I want
05:10 - to move the turtle at any position I
05:13 - don't want to give any specific x and y
05:16 - coordinate for that also we have
05:19 - something Rand in function from random
05:22 - right okay so rather than giving the
05:24 - specific value what we can do here we
05:28 - just use random door from random module
05:30 - Rand in function and the range let's
05:34 - suppose give 0 to uh
05:36 - 300 or let's suppose we 0 to 100 only
05:40 - right for y coordinate also same thing
05:42 - random do Rand in and same let's give 0
05:46 - to
05:48 - 100
05:50 - right and
05:52 - then again Tom dot dot or and
05:58 - any
06:00 - that size of this dot is 20 so see
06:04 - randomly it has chosen this coordinate
06:06 - and again dot but now this these two
06:09 - lines should be go to any specific
06:11 - position and draw the door these two
06:14 - lines should be in a loop right so let's
06:17 - just remove this line just move the
06:20 - circle randomly anywhere and draw the
06:22 - dot or first draw the dot and then move
06:25 - the circle move this Turtle to anywhere
06:28 - right you you can either write down this
06:30 - line first or this line first it's up to
06:32 - you but these two lines should be in in
06:33 - a loop so
06:35 - four let's suppose in a range of uh
06:39 - first let's suppose let's take a small
06:42 - range 100 uh 10
06:44 - only they should be indented right let's
06:47 - run this
06:50 - see these dots are here
06:53 - right but okay now we are moving here
06:57 - this side only this side only only we
07:00 - not moving the turtle is not moving to
07:02 - uh the the that side let me just show
07:05 - you to this side because this side is
07:08 - minus side and we are only generating
07:11 - plus values 0 to 100 0 to 100 so to this
07:15 - side also I want to move this Turtle so
07:17 - better to give Min - 100 let's give-
07:20 - 100- 100 see you can
07:22 - just test the values any values you can
07:26 - give it's not like that you have to
07:27 - giveus 100 100 50 100 4 300 any values
07:30 - you can given you can you can just check
07:32 - out let's run this now
07:35 - see now in both the sides turtle is
07:38 - moving minus plus side right but now you
07:40 - have to
07:42 - extract colors from the image and you
07:45 - have to use but extraction we have used
07:48 - we have done in previous video right so
07:51 - this is my extraction list I have
07:53 - extracted from jk. jpg many colors right
07:56 - and I'm going to just copy paste this
07:58 - color list
08:00 - so this is the color list I have so
08:01 - randomly from this list I'm going to
08:03 - choose now okay so let's choose the
08:07 - color first Tom dot pen
08:12 - color pen color should be randomly from
08:16 - this list just provide the RGB value
08:19 - So Random dot
08:23 - choice and for from this color list
08:26 - choose any tle any tle RG
08:29 - either this this or this right and then
08:33 - that color would be generated this thing
08:35 - also we have seen the pen color how to
08:38 - use pen color and all okay fine let's
08:41 - run
08:43 - this okay see see now the error is bad
08:48 - color sequence 164 152 53 these are bad
08:51 - color sequence because
08:53 - because I told you you have to set the
08:56 - color mode
08:57 - first so the turtle do color mode and
09:01 - the color mode should be on Turtle it's
09:04 - not on the turtle object it's not on to
09:07 - it's turtle turtle do color mode it
09:10 - should be
09:14 - 255 because if you check if you check
09:17 - the the the this
09:20 - uh pen
09:23 - color if you check this pen color from
09:26 - this documentation see now you can we
09:28 - can give
09:35 - are any set pen color to the RGB color
09:38 - represented by the doule rgbs RGB and
09:41 - this RGB must be in the range of zero to
09:43 - color mode and the color mode can be
09:45 - either one obviously if you take a zero
09:47 - color mode from 0 to zero color will be
09:49 - black so either 1 or 255 generally we
09:52 - take 255 to just take the complete
09:55 - integer value like 0 1 2 3 4 up to 255
09:58 - if you take color mode one then it would
10:00 - be in decimal or float value decimal
10:02 - value right so that is why it's
10:04 - compulsory to set the color mode first
10:06 - to use these type of color sequence
10:08 - let's run this and see now this time any
10:13 - random color from this here also we have
10:16 - some colors but that are not exactly
10:18 - visible right these are dark colors and
10:20 - these are light
10:21 - colors so obviously we don't want
10:27 - to draw small pain we want a large
10:30 - painting because that would be more
10:32 - expensive so let's repeat it till 100
10:36 - okay let's run this so this kind of
10:39 - painting you will get but this is in
10:41 - this area only because we have set these
10:44 - XY coordinate to - 100 to minus uh + 100
10:48 - so if you set to
10:50 - 200 to+ 200 or 300 also you can
10:55 - set let's set 300 300
11:00 - and this also 300
11:03 - 300 right because the size is 400 by 300
11:06 - screen size and obviously you don't want
11:08 - to draw that lines so first before
11:12 - drawing this thing at first only let's
11:15 - do and before here only let's do pen
11:19 - up just to pen up that's it no need to
11:23 - do pen down here and let's just increase
11:26 - the speed to the turtle speed of the
11:29 - turtle to fastest 10 let's run
11:34 - this
11:39 - see now I hope now you got how to draw
11:42 - that that this type of painting that
11:44 - would be really expensive you can sell
11:46 - your painting
11:47 - also okay now this kind of thing you can
11:50 - play around with this thing and you can
11:52 - just draw your painting it's up to
11:57 - you if if you want your painting to be
12:00 - more dense then range should be let's
12:03 - take
12:05 - 300 and let's run
12:11 - this so these numbering you can do like
12:15 - you can change according to yourself
12:17 - right so like this there are many
12:19 - paintings of like H painting you can
12:22 - just draw one painting exactly if you
12:24 - want to draw right so this is how we can
12:28 - do this thing I hope you got this
12:29 - exercise right the screen size how to
12:32 - set screen size if you want to set this
12:34 - screen size by default it's this 400 by
12:37 - 300 you can set by this thing same same
12:41 - method you you need to use S1 do screen
12:45 - size S1 do screen size and there you can
12:48 - give what screen size you want to set
12:50 - 500 500 you want to set that is also
12:52 - fine you can set you now I have set the
12:55 - screen size to this and again I'm
12:56 - printing the screen size so let's run
12:58 - this C first screen size was 400 300 and
13:01 - now 500
13:03 - 500
13:04 - right like this you can play around play
13:08 - with this code and you can draw
13:10 - different different paintings right so I
13:12 - hope you got this now I'll see you in
13:14 - the next video till then bye-bye take
13:16 - care
