00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming languages the previous video
00:03 - we have seen what was nested if
00:05 - yesterday feels and alif statements
00:07 - right plus one coding exercise we have
00:09 - seen how to calculate BMI and after
00:11 - calculating BMI you have to tell like
00:12 - you are underweight overweight or normal
00:14 - weight or like this right now one more
00:17 - exercise coding exercise for you is you
00:20 - have to
00:21 - write down a program to check whether a
00:23 - given number is Leap Year or note it is
00:25 - a little bit tricky one
00:28 - right now first of all you you have to
00:30 - know what is Leap Year and how to
00:32 - calculate this generally a year contains
00:34 - 365 design only pair contains 366 days
00:37 - 29 days in February right so how to
00:41 - calculate this is Leap Year or node if
00:43 - you know the formula the logic then
00:46 - I would suggest first of all write down
00:48 - the algorithm write down in the steps
00:51 - then convert that into flowchart and
00:52 - then try to write down a program right
00:55 - if you have written down the algorithm
00:58 - and you have drawn the flow chart then
01:00 - it would be very easy for you to convert
01:02 - these you know the flowchart into
01:04 - program but first understand the logic
01:07 - right you should like that just start
01:09 - writing program
01:11 - right first understand the problem the
01:13 - logic and all think the logic right and
01:16 - if you don't know
01:17 - if you know
01:19 - the logic how to find out how to check
01:21 - the layer is Leap Year not just pause
01:22 - the video is and try to write down the
01:25 - program if you don't know how to find
01:26 - out the given number is Leap Year node
01:28 - then let me just brief you
01:30 - see what we will do there are three to
01:33 - four steps first of all we'll check if
01:35 - the number is divisible by
01:38 - divisible by 4 completely evenly
01:41 - divisible by 4 right then it may be leap
01:45 - year we can't say it would be a leap
01:46 - year but it is if it is not divisible by
01:49 - 4 then definitely it would be not a leap
01:52 - year
01:54 - foreign
01:58 - if it is divisible by 4
02:00 - then you have to check
02:03 - if yes then you have to check
02:06 - if the number is divisible by
02:08 - 100
02:11 - if yes if yes then it may be a leap year
02:16 - we can't say definitely it would be a
02:17 - leap year but if no in this case if no
02:20 - then definitely not a leap year
02:24 - foreign
02:26 - then we will check if that is divisible
02:30 - by
02:32 - 400
02:34 - if divisible by 400 then definitely leap
02:38 - year
02:39 - and if it is not divisible by 400 then
02:42 - not a leap year
02:47 - so this is the simple logic to find out
02:51 - a number is evenly divisible by 4
02:54 - then it would be a leap year except
02:59 - it is evenly divisible by 100
03:03 - unless
03:05 - it is completely divisible by individual
03:07 - by 400.
03:09 - I think that line is confusing for you
03:11 - so just forget that line and see this
03:14 - look this is the logic right
03:16 - now
03:17 - you can write down this in the form of
03:20 - you can say algorithm or the steps or
03:23 - just draw the flow chart so let me just
03:26 - draw the flowchart for you then you will
03:28 - get it better the logic better then we
03:30 - will write down program right so we
03:33 - check first
03:34 - divisible by
03:36 - 4
03:40 - two cases can be there yes or no
03:45 - if it is no then not leap year directly
03:50 - we can say not a leap year if yes then
03:53 - again we will check
03:57 - divisible by
03:59 - 100
04:02 - .
04:05 - there could be two cases yes two choices
04:07 - yes or no
04:09 - if this case if no then yes leap year
04:16 - right
04:17 - if this is the case divisible by 100
04:19 - then again we will take one we'll take
04:22 - one more condition divisible by
04:25 - 400.
04:29 - obviously two choices two cases can be
04:32 - there yes or no
04:33 - if divisible by 400 is yes then
04:38 - leap year
04:40 - if digital by 400 is a no then not a
04:44 - leap year
04:45 - so I guess if you have written down that
04:48 - algorithm you can easily convert that in
04:51 - the flowchart so this is the flowchart
04:54 - right I hope you got
04:56 - when we will get leap year when you will
04:58 - get not a leap year so I guess now it
05:00 - would be easy for you to write down this
05:02 - thing in the form of program using IF
05:04 - else
05:06 - right if you have got the previous
05:08 - lectures yesterday if yesterday fails
05:10 - simply fails if and all right then you
05:13 - can easily convert this thing into
05:15 - program now just pause the video and try
05:17 - out this program so now let's create a
05:19 - new file
05:23 - let's say leap underscore a DOT p y
05:31 - so last from the user which year you
05:33 - want to check right you will take input
05:35 - using the input function input only I
05:38 - have converted that into int now
05:41 - you have the flowchart with you right
05:44 - first of all we'll check if
05:46 - that is divisible by 4
05:49 - if here is completely divisible by 4
05:53 - means there is there should be no
05:55 - remainder evenly division will bind
05:56 - there should be no remainder right so
05:59 - remainder you will check using which
06:00 - operator module operator year modulo 4
06:03 - equal to equal to zero
06:06 - means
06:08 - that can be a leap year we cannot say
06:10 - but if it is not divisible by 4 then
06:12 - definitely it is not a leap year so for
06:14 - this if one else we write
06:18 - for this if
06:21 - if it is not divisible then definitely
06:22 - we can say not a leap year so we can
06:25 - write down print
06:27 - not
06:28 - leap year right
06:30 - now within this if what you will check
06:34 - see this else is for this if right now
06:38 - within this if now what you will check
06:40 - if
06:42 - this year is divisible by completely
06:45 - divisible by
06:47 - 100
06:49 - with no remainder means
06:51 - more hundred equal to equal to 0.
06:55 - if this is true
06:57 - then
06:58 - it may be leap year you have to check on
07:00 - more condition but if it is not it is
07:03 - divisible by 4 completely divisible by 4
07:06 - but not divisible by 100.
07:09 - then
07:10 - it is a leap year you can check out in
07:13 - the flowchart so for this if
07:16 - in the else part you will write what
07:21 - else
07:27 - leap year
07:28 - yes
07:37 - for this if this is the else leap year
07:40 - but within this if this condition is
07:42 - true if it is completely divisible by
07:44 - 100 then once again we'll check
07:46 - condition if
07:49 - here is completely divisible by 400.
07:53 - means with no remainder
07:56 - remainder is zero that to find out
07:58 - remainder views modulo operator
08:01 - now for this if if it is divisible by
08:05 - now in this case uh 400
08:09 - then
08:11 - yes
08:13 - leap year
08:18 - otherwise
08:19 - not a leap year so for this if in else
08:22 - we write
08:28 - not leap year
08:34 - so I hope you got if you got the
08:37 - flowchart you can easily write down this
08:40 - logic but I am not saying you can only
08:42 - write down this thing like that logic in
08:45 - this way only if if we fail since there
08:47 - are multiple ways also Alternatives also
08:49 - you can write down this logic in other
08:51 - ways
08:52 - right
08:53 - like maybe first of all you will check
08:55 - if the ear not completely divisible by
08:58 - zero then it is not a leap year else in
09:01 - else part we can check
09:03 - these conditions so there are multiple
09:05 - ways this is one of the way
09:06 - but whatever the logic that you need to
09:09 - follow that you need to write down
09:11 - correctly now let me just run this
09:13 - program and I'll show you the output so
09:15 - the ER which are you want to check
09:17 - suppose 2023
09:21 - not a leap year because it is not
09:23 - divisible by four first of all we'll
09:25 - check this thing not divisible by four
09:27 - completely divisible by 4 then will not
09:30 - go into this if and in else part of you
09:33 - will go not a leap year let's run this
09:35 - and again check for the year suppose
09:38 - 1900.
09:41 - it is divisible by 4 yes
09:45 - but it is still not a leap year it is
09:48 - divisible by 4 condition true we will
09:50 - enter here the individual by hundred yes
09:52 - that is also true completely divisible
09:55 - by 100
09:56 - again enter in this case it then check
09:58 - divisible by 400 no
10:01 - remainder is not 0.
10:04 - so for this if
10:06 - condition is not true so we'll go into
10:08 - this else part and not a leap year so
10:12 - 1900 is not a DPF
10:15 - so any area you can check here
10:18 - suppose you want to check two zero two
10:20 - four next year
10:22 - that would be a leap year right and if
10:25 - you want to tell you then you can go to
10:27 - the calendar and you can check if the in
10:28 - February we have 29 days then that is a
10:31 - leap year
10:32 - right
10:35 - so I hope you ordered this exercise if
10:37 - not if you haven't got the program then
10:39 - please watch the video again
10:41 - first you know understand the logic the
10:44 - steps the algorithm then the flowchart
10:46 - understand this flowchart then again
10:48 - convert this into a program do not just
10:52 - skip
10:53 - okay you are not getting two to three
10:55 - times you have tried not getting let's
10:57 - jump to the next lecture no this is very
11:00 - simple one
11:01 - right so please take some you can say
11:05 - you can take some break 10 to 15 minutes
11:07 - then come back to this and again write
11:10 - down this program and try to understand
11:12 - the logic and the program right
11:15 - so now in the next video we'll see
11:17 - multiple if statements with the help of
11:18 - Onyx advice and also the next video
11:20 - we'll learn bye take care
