00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:02 - video we have seen range function in
00:04 - Python So based on that we'll be using
00:06 - we'll be doing one more coding exercise
00:08 - so this is very simple although you have
00:10 - to write down a program to sum
00:13 - to find out some of all the even numbers
00:14 - from 1 to 100 including one and hundred
00:18 - right so hint you just you can use range
00:20 - function but some of even numbers only
00:23 - from 1 to 100. in the previous video we
00:26 - have seen sum of all the numbers from 1
00:28 - to 100 but this time only even numbers
00:31 - so there are two ways to do this
00:33 - exercise
00:35 - so I think this this is very simple no
00:37 - need to give you something
00:39 - so let's pause the video and try this
00:42 - out
00:44 - so I hope now you have done this let's
00:46 - do this
00:47 - there are two ways to do this exercise
00:49 - right we will discuss both the ways
00:51 - total is equal to 0 and in range
00:54 - one two one zero one
00:58 - one way is
00:59 - we can do something like this we'll be
01:03 - doing from 2 to 1 0 1 and
01:07 - will increase will take the step size
01:09 - two see by default first would be two
01:13 - what it will print
01:14 - first would be to I then I plus k k is 2
01:18 - 2 plus 2 4 then 6 then 8
01:24 - all the way till 100.
01:27 - right so these all are even numbers you
01:30 - got even numbers now you can simply do
01:32 - total
01:34 - okay first I in I we will be having two
01:37 - second time in I will be having four so
01:39 - the PSI would be added in this total and
01:41 - we will be getting sum of even number
01:43 - only two five five zero
01:46 - second second way is if you do not
01:49 - provide here this third thing
01:52 - so till 1
01:53 - so now it will print
01:55 - what
01:57 - one two three four five till
02:01 - 100 write the range but I want to do
02:05 - some of only these even numbers so yeah
02:09 - we have an idea okay sorry
02:11 - here what we can do we can write down we
02:13 - can check if this I we can check the
02:16 - number is even or not if this I
02:20 - mode 2 equal to equal to 0 means
02:25 - it will be completely divisible by two
02:27 - then definitely it would be even number
02:29 - so there only then only we will do total
02:33 - okay
02:35 - so this total would be now in this four
02:37 - Loop indented right and after that we
02:40 - can simply print this
02:43 - okay I hope now you got this
02:45 - the second way is this let's run this
02:48 - and you will get the same two five five
02:49 - zero
02:51 - so I hope now you get familiar with this
02:52 - range function how to use this right
02:55 - so I hope you have done this exercise
02:57 - successfully so now we'll do the next
02:58 - video till then bye take care
