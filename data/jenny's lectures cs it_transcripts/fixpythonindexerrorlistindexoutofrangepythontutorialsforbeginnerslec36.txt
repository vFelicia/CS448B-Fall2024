00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:02 - video we have seen one coding exercise
00:04 - who is going to pay the bill in that we
00:06 - have used those random functions right
00:09 - now see when you deal with when you work
00:12 - with list or set or Tuple then generally
00:15 - we get this error index out of range
00:17 - error right so in this video we'll talk
00:20 - about this error what is this error how
00:22 - you can fix this error right now index
00:26 - out of range this error is not means
00:28 - what generally you are trying to access
00:31 - an index that is invalid
00:34 - I hope now you are aware about index let
00:38 - us take one example if we have a list
00:40 - something like this in this list I have
00:42 - three items one two three right so index
00:45 - of this would be index standard from
00:48 - zero
00:49 - in no for arrays also for list also in
00:53 - programming language generally index
00:55 - start from zero because it is
00:57 - shifting from starting this is starting
00:59 - offset from starting so this item is
01:02 - from starting shifting of the cells the
01:04 - offset of this item is zero nothing that
01:07 - is why it's zero it's not position like
01:09 - one two three no
01:11 - so 0 1 2 this is what index and how to
01:14 - access these elements suppose I want to
01:16 - access this pile this element or Jia
01:19 - then how you will access simply the name
01:22 - of the list and in square brackets just
01:24 - pass the index one
01:25 - and suppose I am passing this in a and
01:28 - I'm just printing a so it will give you
01:31 - gr
01:32 - but here
01:34 - this error is quite common when you want
01:37 - to access the last element of the list
01:40 - if you want to it's a spiral then which
01:42 - what index you will pass to
01:45 - right then it will give pile but
01:47 - generally what we do we pass suppose
01:50 - three like one two three
01:53 - so you are going to access the index
01:56 - which is invalid with the which doesn't
01:58 - exist in this list is 3 any index no so
02:02 - this time it will give index error the
02:05 - list index out of range
02:07 - right generally it occurs when we want
02:10 - to access the last element see here the
02:12 - list is having only three item but
02:13 - suppose list is having 60 item 100 item
02:15 - then obviously we will not count like 0
02:18 - 1 2 3 index something like this so same
02:21 - I know one simple logic is you can find
02:23 - out the length of the list right here if
02:25 - I want to find out the length of less
02:27 - the the length of the list then the
02:29 - function is simply
02:30 - Len and just pass
02:34 - names so this will give
02:38 - the length of the list and we can store
02:40 - this in a variable like length
02:42 - but the length of what it will give if
02:44 - you print length it will be one two
02:46 - three
02:48 - but here we cannot pass the directly
02:50 - length like this
02:53 - if you don't know how many items are
02:55 - there it will give index error index out
02:58 - of range error why because length is 3
03:01 - but index start from 0 0 1 2 so index is
03:04 - length minus one so better you have to
03:07 - give Here length minus 1.
03:09 - this is how you can remove this right
03:12 - second case is if you are using negative
03:14 - index like minus one because in list
03:16 - negative indexing is allowed so if I
03:18 - write Here length name minus 1 it will
03:21 - print pile minus 2 minus 3 J but if you
03:26 - want to access the first element using
03:28 - negative index and if you write minus 4
03:31 - then it will say mirror index of Fringe
03:34 - so we can say basically index error is
03:36 - an exception in Python which occurs when
03:39 - you try to access an element from the
03:41 - list right from the list or Tuple or set
03:44 - or strings also
03:46 - from the index which is not present in
03:49 - the list at that time index error race
03:53 - now let me just show you this thing with
03:54 - example practically I'll show you okay
03:57 - so let's create a new file here
04:01 - index underscore
04:04 - error.py
04:06 - and simply we will make a list of names
04:09 - so we have taken three elements see you
04:12 - can put these names into single quote
04:14 - also in Python it is allowed
04:16 - now if I want to access like if I want
04:19 - to print
04:20 - something like this
04:22 - directly using F string I am going to
04:23 - print right so I am printing
04:28 - names and at what index suppose index 1
04:31 - index two and I'm just saying hi
04:35 - to whatever is there at this Index right
04:39 - so if I run this and see what you will
04:41 - get
04:44 - see it is printing High Gia right
04:49 - because at second index we have Gia
04:52 - what it if I rather than 2 if I write 3
04:56 - here let me just show you now see now
04:59 - there this is what index error index
05:01 - list index out of range because 3 this
05:04 - index is not there
05:07 - in line number two in module this index
05:11 - error in line number two here this is
05:13 - there right
05:14 - so if rather than this
05:18 - I do something like this if the list is
05:20 - having
05:21 - 10 items
05:23 - like this suppose and list we are having
05:25 - these items so I don't know how many
05:27 - items are there maybe 50 60 items can be
05:28 - there so what we can do is we can find
05:30 - out the length of the list if you don't
05:31 - know
05:33 - right length of the list is suppose we
05:36 - have a function Len and in there just
05:38 - how to pass the
05:40 - this name of the list is names now we
05:44 - got the length of the list right but
05:46 - here it's not like that we can pass
05:50 - this length
05:52 - let's suppose you pass you are passing
05:54 - the length and maybe you get maybe you
05:56 - are thinking you will get high whatever
05:57 - the last element in the list like hi
05:59 - pradeep so let's run this and I'll show
06:02 - you what I'll put it again you are
06:03 - getting index error list out of index
06:05 - because length is what for this list one
06:08 - two three four five six seven right but
06:11 - the index starts from 0 0 to 6 so index
06:14 - for pradeep is six so if you want to
06:16 - access the last element length minus 1
06:19 - and this time it will print hi pradeep
06:23 - right same for minus a negative indexing
06:26 - also if suppose I write here
06:29 - minus 7 see minus 7 then it will print
06:32 - gen
06:33 - High Journey because negative indexing
06:35 - start from minus 1 over to zero because
06:37 - minus 0 is nothing it's only zero not
06:39 - mine is zero that is why negative index
06:41 - start from I minus one so minus 1 to
06:43 - minus seven but if you want to access
06:45 - minus 8
06:47 - then
06:48 - same index error you will get here
06:51 - so this is how like you will get index
06:54 - error and
06:55 - uh like why you are getting this index
06:57 - here and how you can fix it
07:00 - so I hope what is this index error and
07:02 - how to fix it is clear to you guys now
07:04 - in the next video we'll see nested list
07:06 - so now I'll see you in the next video
07:07 - till then bye take care
