00:00 - so in the series of learning c plus plus
00:02 - programming language we are discussing
00:04 - control structures in c plus plus till
00:05 - now we have discussed simple if
00:07 - statement if else and elsif letter
00:10 - so now the next is nested if and nested
00:13 - if else yes we can do nesting of if as
00:15 - well as nesting of effects now what is
00:17 - this nested in
00:19 - what is nested if else why to use these
00:21 - when to use this how to use these uh
00:23 - these statements in your program
00:26 - right everything about these statements
00:27 - we'll be discussing in this video video
00:29 - with the help of a program i'll show you
00:31 - practically also we'll see
00:33 - with the help of program and we'll
00:34 - relate these thing with the help of you
00:36 - know real life examples also right so
00:40 - now before i just want to tell you one
00:41 - thing if you guys are preparing for gate
00:43 - 2023 exam will be preparing for your
00:45 - gate 2023 exam
00:48 - then geeks for geeks is conducting a
00:50 - gate csol india scholarship test on 6th
00:53 - of august
00:54 - right and best part is it is free you
00:56 - can take this test for free it will be
00:58 - contained
00:59 - you know consisting 24 questions time
01:02 - limit would be one hour and mark's total
01:04 - marks are 120 marks
01:07 - so uh this test would be you can see
01:08 - it's a miniature version of real gate
01:10 - exam simulation of real gate exam so if
01:13 - you take this online online exam then
01:15 - definitely it is going to you know boost
01:17 - your gate exam preparation
01:19 - and you will like i will provide you you
01:22 - know admission to one of the best gate
01:24 - live batches with amazing discounts and
01:27 - this test consists of complete 20 gay
01:30 - 2023 slavers and
01:32 - similar question pattern of you know
01:34 - real gate computer science exam
01:37 - it has been exclusively you know made by
01:40 - their gate toppers and experts
01:42 - so what benefits you will get if you go
01:44 - for this test top three rankers will get
01:47 - 30 scholarship then 4 to 10 rankers will
01:50 - get 20 scholarship and uh and after that
01:52 - 11 to 50 rankers will get 10 percent
01:55 - scholarship
01:56 - so all the relevant links and details
01:58 - i'll put in the description box of this
02:00 - video you can go and check out now let's
02:02 - see what is this nester defend
02:04 - yesterday's statements
02:06 - nested of it means see
02:08 - one if we have
02:10 - within this if we have one more if
02:12 - within this we have one one more this is
02:15 - what called as nested
02:18 - and nested defense means one we have if
02:21 - then we have some condition within this
02:23 - if we have one more if else if
02:26 - right
02:27 - then else
02:29 - and closing of the set after that else
02:31 - this else is for this if within this
02:34 - else we have like if
02:36 - else
02:38 - this is something like nested if else
02:41 - this is nested if only we are just
02:43 - nesting if only right
02:46 - so nested if it is also possible nested
02:47 - if s is also possible now when when to
02:50 - use these kind of things why we use
02:51 - these things see when we have more than
02:54 - one condition
02:55 - right
02:56 - and these conditions are dependent on
02:58 - each other
03:00 - then we use
03:01 - the scenario nested if scenario
03:04 - right
03:05 - now let's take one condition and till
03:07 - how many levels you can nest this if
03:10 - it's unlimited
03:12 - like if if if within this if you can
03:15 - write down multiple you know nesting you
03:17 - it is possible it is not limited right
03:20 - now let's take a scenario see
03:23 - your mom will say like your mother say
03:26 - if you go to supermarket
03:28 - right first condition is if go to
03:30 - supermarket
03:32 - then
03:34 - if orange is available then buy oranges
03:38 - right
03:39 - so one one condition is if
03:43 - go to supermarket
03:47 - then one more if
03:48 - like apple
03:50 - apples
03:53 - available then
03:56 - buy
03:57 - so this
03:58 - if is you can say inner right and this
04:01 - is outright
04:03 - so
04:04 - to enter into this inner if this outer
04:06 - if condition must be true in this case
04:08 - also to buy oranges you have to go to
04:11 - supermarket
04:12 - so if this condition is true if you are
04:15 - going to supermarket then only you can
04:16 - buy oranges
04:18 - if you don't go to supermarket then
04:20 - definitely we are not going to enter
04:21 - into this if block and no execution of
04:24 - this nrf statement in a if condition
04:26 - directly we will go out
04:29 - whatever you write here after this if
04:31 - blow
04:32 - right
04:33 - so to execute the nrf condition to check
04:36 - the inner if condition the outer if
04:37 - condition must be true thus you need to
04:40 - take care right for more nesting you can
04:43 - do like if
04:44 - go to supermarket if like good apples
04:48 - available
04:49 - like if apple available then we'll check
04:52 - if
04:53 - quality is
04:55 - good then only buy
04:58 - so this is also nesting of if
05:01 - right
05:02 - so this if condition is if good good
05:04 - apples available for this condition to
05:06 - be true the outer if condition must be
05:08 - true
05:09 - if apples are not available in the
05:10 - supermarket then how you can check that
05:12 - apples the quality is good or bad
05:15 - so for this condition to be true or to
05:18 - be checked
05:19 - this outer if condition must be true
05:21 - apple must be available in supermarket
05:24 - then only you can check if these are
05:25 - good or bad
05:27 - so when we have multiple conditions more
05:29 - than one condition to check and these
05:31 - conditions are dependent on each other
05:33 - then we use these kind of scenario
05:35 - nested if a nested defense
05:37 - yeah we can do these kind of things with
05:39 - another scenario also that we'll discuss
05:41 - in the at the end of this video but
05:42 - first
05:43 - i think it is clear to you how to use
05:46 - and when to use this nested if and
05:48 - nested if else statements
05:51 - right so see general generally if i
05:54 - write down so if
05:57 - like condition one
05:59 - then
06:01 - one more if
06:02 - if
06:04 - condition two right
06:06 - like this
06:08 - if
06:09 - condition 3 like this it will be going
06:11 - on and at last suppose if
06:16 - condition n
06:18 - and within this i'm writing statement
06:22 - n
06:23 - right
06:24 - and
06:25 - closing of all the if and after this if
06:28 - block i am just writing a statement
06:29 - statement
06:31 - x so this is nested of f only
06:36 - up to n level you can nest so how you
06:38 - can you know map this with help of a
06:40 - flowchart see
06:42 - this is suppose
06:45 - we are executing the program the entry
06:47 - then we got condition one this one
06:50 - two cases can be there
06:52 - right
06:53 - if this is true
06:56 - if this condition is true then only we
06:57 - will enter then we got second condition
07:00 - okay
07:02 - condition 2
07:05 - if this is true
07:06 - then only we will enter here then
07:08 - condition
07:09 - 3 and up to condition n
07:11 - so like this up to condition
07:14 - n
07:17 - now if this condition is true
07:20 - then statement n would be executed
07:27 - and after statement end obviously out of
07:30 - this if and then statement
07:32 - x
07:37 - statement x but second case is if the
07:40 - first condition is false
07:42 - if this condition is false definitely we
07:45 - will not
07:46 - these inner if a condition will not be
07:48 - checked this would not be executed
07:49 - directly control will go out of this
07:52 - statement
07:53 - to statement x
07:55 - okay now
07:57 - in case if this condition is false if
07:59 - true next condition would be checked if
08:01 - false if false in that case
08:04 - within the block we are not writing you
08:06 - know we are not writing any statements
08:08 - like we have written within this
08:10 - this this block statement n
08:13 - same you can write like statement 1
08:14 - statement 2 like this but we are not
08:16 - writing any statements so directly if
08:18 - false directly it will go to statement x
08:20 - out of this if block same if this
08:22 - condition n is true directly will go to
08:24 - statement x and after that maybe exit or
08:27 - further we can execute the program
08:30 - this would be you can say a flowchart of
08:32 - nested or if
08:35 - right
08:36 - same for if else i have shown you how to
08:39 - write down this thing if condition 1
08:41 - then if
08:43 - another condition right
08:45 - then
08:46 - you can say here is some statements you
08:49 - can say
08:52 - in a riff of
08:54 - if block
08:57 - statement
08:59 - right
09:00 - and then else
09:02 - and here you will write
09:06 - inner else of if
09:10 - block
09:12 - statement or rather than this you can
09:13 - write like statement x statement y
09:15 - statement abc something like this
09:17 - right then we write else then again we
09:20 - write if
09:23 - condition three
09:24 - if and else
09:26 - block like this you will write
09:28 - if else nesting of your files
09:30 - so now it is assignment for you guys you
09:32 - have to map this thing into this kind of
09:34 - flowchart i hope you can do this we have
09:36 - discussed many type of flowcharts
09:38 - in this video also we have discussed one
09:40 - and before that also we discussed so i
09:42 - guess you have some idea now now you can
09:44 - map this process in this flowchart
09:47 - just map this this is assignment for you
09:50 - guys and just send me maybe one in the
09:52 - comment section or a screenshot you can
09:54 - send on my instagram account
09:55 - right
09:56 - now let's
09:58 - do practical of this thing let's take a
10:00 - simple example and let's
10:02 - write a program so this is a program let
10:05 - me just first tell you the scenario we
10:07 - are discussing nested of offense so the
10:10 - condition is
10:11 - if
10:12 - the same example you are taking if you
10:14 - have money greater than thousand rupees
10:16 - right
10:17 - then second condition is you have to
10:19 - check if your partner age is greater
10:22 - than 21
10:23 - then you can take wine
10:25 - else
10:28 - coffee in starbucks
10:30 - right
10:32 - else in else part
10:34 - if you have money greater than 500 then
10:37 - you can take coffee in ccd else
10:40 - in a normal shop you can take coffee and
10:42 - then let's go home
10:44 - this is the scenario
10:46 - in this spectrum in this program we have
10:48 - one more factor that is you have to
10:49 - check age also
10:51 - h bar is also there
10:54 - so i guess the both thing is clear to
10:56 - you hash include iostream.h then
10:58 - namespace std then main in main we are
11:00 - writing like we are taking two variables
11:03 - money and partner age
11:05 - so first of all we will ask enter money
11:07 - right if money greater than equal to
11:09 - thousand rupees then ask
11:11 - enter your partner age
11:13 - if this condition is true then only we
11:15 - will ask partner age
11:17 - enter the partner age if that is greater
11:19 - than 21 then let's have wine else let's
11:21 - have coffee
11:23 - let's have coffee in starbucks
11:26 - that's right
11:32 - now now in this else part again we are
11:34 - writing if else
11:36 - within the cells again we are writing if
11:37 - so this is what nested defense if money
11:40 - greater than 500 then coffins is ready l
11:42 - swapping any normal shop and let's go
11:44 - home right now let's run this and see
11:47 - what
11:48 - output will get here
11:50 - see first of all it is asking enter
11:52 - money i'm entering 1200 i have
11:54 - then it will ask enter partner age
11:56 - partner age is
11:58 - 20
11:59 - so let's have coffee in starbucks and
12:01 - after that
12:03 - what the statement we have written
12:05 - out of this if else
12:07 - block let's go home so that would also
12:09 - be printed let's go
12:10 - right now let's run this again
12:13 - enter money i have suppose uh
12:16 - 600 so first condition is not true so
12:18 - now it will not ask the partner age
12:21 - 600 then
12:23 - coffee in ccd and let's go
12:25 - okay
12:26 - 600 means this condition is true else
12:29 - money greater than 500 yes this
12:30 - condition is true so enter into this
12:32 - else into this if block coffin ccd after
12:36 - that after that just exit from the this
12:38 - outrails and let's go home right let's
12:41 - run this again and suppose i have 100
12:43 - rupees
12:44 - so coffee in any normal shop and let's
12:46 - go
12:48 - i hope now you would
12:50 - why to use and how to use this uh nested
12:52 - defense we have now more than one
12:55 - condition money as well as age of the
12:56 - partner and this is dependent on each
12:58 - other right
13:00 - if you don't have money greater than
13:02 - 1000 rupees you don't need to check your
13:05 - partner age
13:07 - right
13:08 - if below thousand then you can have only
13:11 - coffee in ccd or any normal show right
13:15 - if more than thousand then only the
13:17 - dependent condition is what you have to
13:18 - check the partner age for that
13:21 - this for this inner if condition
13:23 - for execution of this inner if this
13:25 - outright must be true
13:28 - right
13:29 - before checking the partner age your
13:30 - money you have more than thousand rupees
13:33 - in your pocket
13:34 - right
13:35 - now
13:36 - say i think you can do
13:38 - an example with nested of nested if
13:41 - rather than if else right
13:44 - so if if you know we are not writing any
13:46 - else statement if and if only if and if
13:50 - and after that the just close no else
13:52 - and else part yesterday that is
13:54 - yesterday
13:56 - so now how you can do this thing this is
13:58 - your your assignment you have to do this
14:00 - program with the help of nested a phone
14:02 - right like if money greater than
14:04 - thousand then if partner is greater than
14:06 - this then let's have this let's have
14:08 - this thing no else part
14:11 - or three nested if also you can do
14:13 - three or four nested it
14:15 - right it's not like that you have to
14:16 - take this example only you can take
14:18 - another example also according to that
14:20 - you can
14:21 - do your program but you have to practice
14:22 - this thing instead of if i hope you can
14:24 - do this now now
14:26 - rather than you rather than using this
14:27 - nested if what you can use you can use a
14:30 - logical land operator
14:33 - see if go to supermarket and
14:36 - orange is available
14:38 - and
14:39 - good orange is available then buy
14:42 - that's it within a single if statement
14:45 - you can write down all the three two you
14:47 - know three four five conditions
14:49 - so to check these more than one
14:50 - condition which are dependent on each
14:52 - other you can use logical and operators
14:54 - simple i have already discussed a video
14:56 - in this like operator what is logical
14:58 - and how to use this so you can try out
15:00 - this thing with your own rather than
15:02 - using nested if first of all try to
15:04 - write a program to you know
15:07 - uh using yesterday
15:08 - then
15:09 - do that program write that program
15:11 - without necessarily
15:13 - with the help of single if statement and
15:14 - use logical and operator
15:16 - right like if you go to supermarket and
15:20 - apple available both the conditions are
15:21 - true then only you can buy
15:23 - same thing
15:25 - in yesterday false you can do if go to
15:27 - supermarket within that more if if
15:29 - orange is available then buy same thing
15:32 - right
15:33 - i hope you go to this point so let's you
15:35 - have to try this program at your own
15:37 - right so in the next video we'll see
15:39 - switch case statements so answer the
15:41 - next video till then bye take care
