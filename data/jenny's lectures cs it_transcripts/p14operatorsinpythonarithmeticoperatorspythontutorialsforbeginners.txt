00:00 - so when the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:04 - video I guess we have discussed type
00:05 - conversion or type casting like how to
00:07 - convert one data type to another data
00:09 - type okay and with the help of one
00:11 - example like we have discussed how to
00:13 - add digits of a two digit number that
00:16 - program we have discussed right so the
00:18 - next topic is operators in Python see we
00:21 - have discussed water operator plus till
00:23 - now like if you use this plus uh for
00:27 - Strings uh then it will be a
00:28 - concatenation of two string it will
00:30 - concatenate these two strings plus also
00:33 - means addition right so these other
00:34 - operators are also there and like in C
00:37 - and C plus plus also we have some
00:38 - operators arithmetic relational logical
00:40 - and all same in Python also we have
00:43 - different type of operators all the
00:45 - operators will be discussing one by one
00:46 - right with the help of examples and
00:48 - programs we will see practical also fine
00:51 - but before they just want to tell you
00:52 - one thing after collaborating with gate
00:55 - academy an academy has come up with the
00:57 - biggest Initiative for engineering
00:59 - students and the motive is to empower
01:01 - Engineers for this an academy is
01:05 - conducting a free of host scholarship
01:07 - test on 25th of September at 11 am and
01:12 - the questions are curated by gate
01:14 - academy top Educators and if you take
01:17 - this test then you can apply for gate
01:20 - 2023 for free yes the top 3000 rankers
01:25 - will get their gate 2023 registration
01:29 - fee refunded by an academy
01:32 - that is not all
01:33 - first ranker from each branch will get
01:37 - their one year college fee
01:40 - you know refunded by an academy up to
01:42 - rupees one lakh and you also stand a
01:47 - chance to win scholarship from pool of
01:49 - rupees 30 crore so this kind of test has
01:54 - never happened and it is a wonderful
01:57 - opportunity for you guys so the link the
02:00 - enrollment link I'll put in the
02:01 - description box of this video
02:03 - and you can use my code jkl10 to enroll
02:06 - for this test so go and enroll for this
02:09 - test right now all the element links and
02:11 - details you will find in the description
02:13 - box of this video now let's see what are
02:17 - operators in Python what are operators
02:19 - in Python see operators simply what
02:22 - these are some symbols so these are used
02:25 - to perform some operations on maybe
02:26 - values or maybe variables like if I say
02:30 - like 5 plus 2 this is what plus is what
02:33 - operator and this 5 and 2 these are
02:35 - operands or values you can say or simply
02:38 - if I write like a is equal to 5 b is
02:40 - equal to 2 then I can say a plus b
02:43 - so A and B are variables okay so these
02:46 - operators are what used to perform some
02:49 - operations on on either values or
02:51 - variables
02:52 - okay like plus we have so like this we
02:55 - have more mathematical operators also
02:58 - okay now in this this plus and suppose I
03:01 - say 5 minus 2 this minus these are
03:03 - operators 5 and 2 operand A and B
03:05 - operand
03:07 - okay now there are multiple there are
03:10 - you know multiple types of operands in
03:12 - Python like assignment sorry the first
03:15 - arithmetic operators then relational or
03:17 - you can say comparison operator logical
03:19 - operator assignment Operator bitwise
03:21 - Operator and some you know special
03:24 - operators are there like identity
03:25 - operator membership operator so all
03:28 - these operators will be discussing one
03:29 - by one in this video we'll be talking
03:31 - about more arithmetic operators okay
03:34 - let's discuss
03:37 - so these are different type of operators
03:39 - arithmetic relational or comparison
03:41 - logical bitwise assignment identity and
03:43 - membership so this video we'll be
03:44 - discussing more about arithmetic
03:45 - operators
03:46 - I hope you know like in arithmetic we
03:49 - have plus so no need to explain like
03:51 - pluses for what addition obviously then
03:53 - minus subtraction then this is what star
03:56 - or you can say this is for
03:57 - multiplication this is for division okay
04:00 - and this is for modulus modulus means it
04:04 - will give remainder okay like five mode
04:07 - two means the remain if you divide 5 by
04:10 - 2 the remainder would be one so it will
04:12 - give one remainder now one thing in
04:16 - Python if I write 5 divided by 2
04:20 - you are using python three point
04:22 - something 3.10 like three point X
04:25 - version we are using so here if you
04:27 - write down this thing if you print
04:29 - this it will give you 2.5
04:33 - float number it will give you in Python
04:36 - three point x this divisor will also
04:38 - will always give you a float number
04:40 - floating Point number if I write
04:43 - something like this 2 divided by 2
04:45 - for I would say 4 divided by 2 so this 2
04:49 - divide this 4 cleanly it would be 2 but
04:52 - the answer would be 2.0 a floating Point
04:55 - number always in three point x in three
04:57 - point X version
04:59 - now if you wanna get integer value
05:02 - I want to get only 2 because it divides
05:05 - cleanly okay so you can use flow
05:08 - division one more operator is there
05:10 - lower division is you can represent that
05:12 - thing with
05:14 - 2 slash this is flow division so if I
05:18 - write here
05:19 - floor division two
05:21 - now it will give me 2.
05:23 - okay this is flow division next is power
05:27 - see Power is one means 2 raised to power
05:29 - 3.
05:31 - it's like eight four raised to the power
05:33 - 2 it will give 4 into 2 that is
05:36 - 16 okay now
05:39 - power here how we to you can calculate
05:42 - using an operator's power for power
05:44 - there is an operator
05:46 - double star
05:48 - so you you can write simply like print
05:51 - two double star three
05:55 - simple it will give eight
05:58 - four double star two
06:02 - it will give sixteen so this is what
06:04 - power
06:05 - okay I'll show you practically also
06:07 - we'll see
06:08 - you know the examples on our laptop but
06:12 - I hope you got this thing now if in one
06:15 - expression we have more than one
06:17 - operator like one expression I have
06:19 - there are two more concept when it comes
06:22 - to operator I hope you know you have
06:25 - heard this thing precedence and
06:26 - associativity so see suppose if I write
06:28 - something like this 5 plus 2 into 3.
06:33 - so here we have two operators into and
06:36 - plus so which one you will evaluate
06:38 - first
06:40 - if I evaluate 5 plus 2 first means 5
06:42 - plus 2 is 7 into 3 it will give you
06:46 - twenty one second way is what evaluate
06:49 - this first means 5 plus 6 it will give
06:53 - you 11 so which is right obviously this
06:56 - is right we know some rules are there
06:59 - like board Mass rule which one to
07:00 - evaluate first
07:02 - so here also we have precedence of The
07:04 - Operators now this pin 2 multiplication
07:06 - is having higher precedence precedence
07:08 - Than This plus
07:10 - so what is that precedence chart for
07:13 - these arithmetic operators I am telling
07:16 - only arithmetic operators first
07:18 - obviously first would be parenthesis
07:20 - okay then there is power or you can say
07:23 - exponent this operator exponent
07:27 - then
07:28 - we have you can say like we have
07:31 - multiplication
07:33 - division flow Division and mode then
07:36 - plus and minus plus and minus are having
07:38 - least precedence
07:40 - I'm talking about only arithmetic
07:42 - operators not about all other operators
07:44 - in this video right now
07:47 - so this is the president of the
07:49 - arithmetic operators you can say we can
07:51 - write down here
07:53 - temtas
07:54 - parenthesis first exponent then
07:57 - multiplication division
07:59 - at the same you know level we have then
08:02 - addition subtraction at the same level
08:03 - we have okay now one
08:06 - expression is something like this this
08:09 - is the expression now so here we have
08:11 - okay plus minus are having less
08:13 - precedence than in 2 and this division
08:16 - okay but
08:17 - this multiplication and divide are
08:19 - having same precedence so which one you
08:21 - will evaluate first now
08:24 - so this confusion would be solved with
08:26 - the help of One More Concept that that
08:28 - is associativity
08:30 - when more than one operators are there
08:32 - of same precedence then
08:35 - associativity comes into picture
08:37 - now for this associativity is what for
08:40 - these operators associativity is left to
08:42 - right for plus and minus also left to
08:44 - right for this it is right to left for
08:47 - exponent of for power it is right to
08:49 - left okay for these left to right means
08:53 - you will move from left to right and
08:55 - whichever operator comes first we will
08:57 - solve that first
08:58 - so okay rather than plus and minus first
09:01 - we will solve multiplication and
09:03 - division because these are having higher
09:05 - precedence but which one from these two
09:07 - move left to right multiplication comes
09:10 - first so this should be solved first
09:12 - three into two that is 6. then this 5.
09:18 - this would be a 10 divided by 5 could be
09:21 - 2.0 because this is a division of flow
09:24 - division like this then only plus and
09:27 - minus are remaining so same left to
09:28 - right associativity move left to right
09:30 - then this 5 plus 6 this would be solved
09:33 - first that is 11 then here I have minus
09:37 - 1 plus we have 2.0 then this minus will
09:39 - be solved first that is 10 10 plus 2.0
09:42 - and the answer would be 12 point zero
09:44 - like this
09:45 - these are very simple I guess arithmetic
09:48 - operators only the different and the
09:49 - more two new operators are flow Division
09:52 - and exponent okay
09:54 - so you have to okay you have to change
09:57 - you have to change some this expression
09:59 - I don't know how you will change but the
10:01 - answer I want it should give 11.0
10:07 - maybe you can add like in case you can
10:09 - add a parenthesis because parentheses
10:10 - are having higher precedence if you add
10:12 - somewhere parenthesis then that would be
10:15 - executed first
10:17 - but you have to add some parenthesis
10:19 - here maybe one or two I don't know but
10:21 - the answer should be 11.0 let's try it
10:23 - so I guess that's it for arithmetic
10:25 - operators let me just show you these
10:28 - operators on my laptop
10:31 - so let's create a new file right click
10:33 - on this then new then file and name I'm
10:37 - writing
10:41 - arithmetic
10:44 - operators arithmetic underscore
10:47 - operators.py Okay so simply like if I
10:51 - want to print 5 plus 2 then simply you
10:56 - can just write down this thing into
10:59 - print
11:00 - okay and you can just right click and
11:03 - run this and it will give you seven okay
11:05 - so I guess these are simple plus minus
11:07 - and all let me just
11:10 - show you this divide thing
11:12 - okay
11:13 - division so it will give you 2.5
11:16 - if I write here rather than 5 I'm
11:19 - writing 4 here and now let me just run
11:21 - this and it will give you 2.0 it is
11:24 - dividing it cleanly it should give two
11:26 - but it is in 2.0 so if you want that
11:30 - integer part only
11:32 - not floating Point number just use flow
11:35 - division okay double the slash it will
11:38 - give you two this is slow division okay
11:41 - now power what about power C if I write
11:46 - star star 2 then it will give you 16.
11:50 - okay if I write here uh star like uh 2
11:56 - raised to power 3 I want to do it will
11:58 - give you eight two raised to power 3 it
12:01 - will give you 8 so this is what exponent
12:02 - or power
12:03 - okay
12:05 - now what are other operators modulo
12:07 - operator we can write something like
12:09 - this like five
12:10 - and
12:12 - this mode 2.
12:15 - 5 mode 2 the remainder would be what one
12:18 - so it will give you one it will give
12:20 - remainder
12:21 - fine and the expression we have
12:23 - discussed let me just write down that
12:24 - expression here see this was the
12:27 - expression let me just run this and it
12:29 - will give you what 12.0 okay in this
12:32 - expression it has applied that president
12:33 - said associativity rule okay that we
12:36 - have discussed so these I think
12:38 - arithmetic operators are very simple
12:40 - or rather than this directly writing
12:43 - this you can what you can do what you
12:45 - can just take a variable like a is equal
12:46 - to 5 and b equal to I am taking 2.
12:52 - and rather than this you can write down
12:54 - print
12:55 - a divided by B this is also fine
12:59 - on the variables a divided by B will
13:01 - give you 2.5 this is division or flow
13:04 - division okay so now one assignment for
13:06 - you is you have to calculate
13:11 - BMI
13:13 - BMI body mass index so what is the
13:17 - formula for that weight divide by BMI
13:23 - weight divide by
13:27 - height
13:29 - cos Square
13:31 - height Square
13:34 - height power 2.
13:37 - that is the thing like height I am
13:39 - writing your height into
13:41 - height this thing
13:45 - but this is simply you cannot write down
13:47 - this because because of associativity
13:49 - this divide would be executed first so
13:51 - you have to put this height into height
13:52 - into parenthesis
13:54 - height into height means height keep you
13:57 - high you don't have to use height into
13:58 - height you have to use power operator
14:00 - exponent operator okay so this is the
14:02 - formula weight in kg you have to take in
14:06 - from the user enter your weight in kg
14:08 - enter your height in meters in meters
14:12 - ok so height in meters would be in float
14:15 - okay so wait you can take an INT value
14:19 - and height you have to take float
14:22 - so you have to take you have to use
14:24 - input function take input from the user
14:26 - enter your weight enter your height and
14:29 - simple hint is what
14:31 - maybe sometime maybe you have to do some
14:33 - type casting type conversion and then
14:36 - use the operators we have discussed till
14:38 - now arithmetic operators and you just
14:40 - you can calculate this thing if you are
14:42 - not getting this point this you know
14:44 - exercise you can let me know in comment
14:46 - section maybe we can discuss the
14:48 - solution in next video okay so you have
14:50 - to calculate the BMI body mass index so
14:54 - in the next video we will see a
14:56 - relational operators or comparison
14:57 - operators in Python so now it's in the
14:59 - next video till then bye bye take care
