00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - C plus plus programming language in the
00:05 - previous video we have seen what is
00:06 - range based for Loop and why we use this
00:09 - and how this is different from
00:10 - traditional for Loop and with the heck
00:12 - of program we have seen that thing right
00:14 - now based on that we will do one coding
00:16 - exercise in this video okay based on
00:20 - Range based for Loops so now the
00:22 - exercise Is We I have given you a vector
00:24 - this is a vector although we haven't
00:26 - discussed Vector till now in the series
00:29 - we'll be discussing in detail what
00:31 - Vector is but it's like you can say for
00:34 - now you can say it's a dynamic array
00:36 - just like array but we can change the
00:38 - size of vector so as you can see array
00:41 - is also something like this how to
00:43 - declare or Define a vector just write
00:45 - down Vector here in these
00:48 - brackets will lie down int or you can
00:51 - say the data type their type of this all
00:54 - the data is int the name of the vector
00:56 - any variable you can take
00:58 - a b c x y num back num anything and this
01:02 - is the vector the value of vector is 3 6
01:05 - 15 and till 300 something like this okay
01:08 - now you have to
01:11 - use range based for Loop to Loop through
01:16 - this vector
01:17 - and you have to find out how many
01:19 - numbers are evenly divisible by
01:24 - either 3
01:27 - or 5.
01:31 - make this thing very clear I am saying
01:33 - evenly divisible by either three or five
01:37 - how many numbers you have to count
01:39 - those numbers and you have to use a
01:41 - range based for loop I guess this is not
01:43 - so much stuff
01:44 - if you have idea about range base for
01:46 - Loop how to use this thing and if you
01:49 - have idea like how to find out if a
01:52 - number is divisible by like maybe three
01:54 - or five or any other number
01:56 - we use like mode module operator
01:59 - okay so now let's pause the video and
02:02 - try this out okay so I hope you have
02:04 - tried this out let's do this together
02:09 - so
02:10 - create a new file coding exercise 4 dot
02:14 - CPP because we have done three coding
02:16 - says before
02:17 - so at first what include IO stream
02:22 - the setter file then we will use Vector
02:25 - here so you have to include
02:27 - Vector also this header file and then
02:31 - using namespace STD why we are including
02:34 - this header Vector that we will see when
02:39 - we will discuss Vector in detail right
02:41 - using namespace STD and int main you can
02:45 - access my C plus playlist and there in
02:47 - the starting videos you will get why we
02:48 - are why we are using this we are
02:51 - including this file this you know line
02:54 - using namespace STD why we are including
02:56 - the screen space
02:58 - so please check out the C plus plus
03:00 - complete playlist and then in the
03:02 - starting videos you will get the basic
03:04 - videos right
03:06 - okay now
03:09 - I've given you a vector and the name of
03:13 - the this Vector is suppose I'm taking
03:14 - num what are the values in this Vector 3
03:17 - 5 6 these values we have
03:21 - so let's take a variable
03:24 - count at starting we are initializing
03:26 - this count with zero now put condition
03:28 - if sorry obviously you have to use first
03:32 - because we have to Loop through this
03:34 - complete Vector we will take first three
03:36 - then we will check it is divisible by
03:38 - either three or five then six then
03:40 - fifteen so every variable we have to
03:42 - take so we'll use range base for you
03:45 - four
03:46 - let's
03:48 - write down here Auto rather than it
03:51 - and the variable M suppose in time
03:53 - taking and the name of
03:54 - this Vector is num
03:57 - okay num that the range expression name
03:59 - is num
04:01 - so now let's put the condition if
04:04 - this n
04:06 - is divisible by
04:08 - more
04:10 - 3 equal to equal to 0. if it is
04:12 - completely divisible by
04:15 - a 3 then modulo operator will give 0.
04:19 - and here sorry
04:21 - after that either by 3 or 5 so
04:27 - this is our operator logical one or n
04:31 - mode 5 equal to equal to 0.
04:34 - if this is the case we will do just
04:38 - count plus plus
04:40 - okay and after
04:42 - this for Loop
04:44 - not print C out
04:47 - C out just print
04:49 - your count variable
04:53 - that's it
04:55 - returns 0
04:58 - I hope this is not the tough one logic
05:01 - is not tough one because see first time
05:03 - in nam we have three this is a
05:06 - collection so first time
05:09 - n becomes
05:12 - n equal to 3 3 would be assigned right
05:15 - now let's
05:17 - check this condition
05:18 - if 3 mode 3 equal to equal to 0 yes
05:21 - completely divisible by 3 so this
05:24 - condition is true it is logical or
05:26 - logical or means either this or this to
05:28 - be true
05:31 - if this is true then no need to check
05:33 - the second condition if this is true
05:35 - this complete expression will give true
05:38 - okay and if true means you will enter
05:41 - into this if statement and count plus
05:43 - plus one now count becomes
05:46 - 1.
05:47 - right next time 6 would be assigned to
05:51 - This n now next time n becomes
05:55 - 6.
05:57 - now check six mode three equal to equal
06:00 - to 0 yes
06:01 - we will divide six by three then the
06:03 - remainder is 0 so this condition is true
06:06 - so this condition is 2 means this
06:08 - complete expression will give true so
06:10 - we'll enter here now count becomes
06:12 - two
06:14 - for 15 now see 15 is divisible by 3 yes
06:18 - so we will not check the next condition
06:19 - again count becomes now 3. okay now 17
06:24 - see 17 more 3 equal to equal to 0 no 17
06:29 - then we will check the second condition
06:31 - if this is false then we'll check the
06:32 - second condition 17 mod 5 equal to equal
06:35 - to 0 no this is also false so we'll not
06:37 - enter here count plus plus no count plus
06:39 - plus now for 18 we will check then same
06:42 - for 21 then 55 then 100 200 and 300 like
06:46 - this right okay let's run this
06:49 - and see what output you will get here
06:54 - so 9
06:55 - 9 elements are completely divisible by
07:02 - either three or five see one two three
07:06 - four five six seven eight nine yeah
07:11 - only 17 is left
07:14 - otherwise
07:15 - these elements are either divisible by
07:17 - three completely evenly divisible by 3
07:19 - or 5. so answer is 9. I guess that is
07:23 - not so tough coding exercise
07:25 - okay if you haven't got this thing it's
07:28 - okay just write down this code on a
07:30 - piece of paper write on this take this
07:32 - dry run this manually rather than here
07:35 - one by one step by step what is
07:37 - happening by writing like this right
07:40 - then definitely you will get it
07:42 - so I hope you have done this exercise
07:44 - yourself or if you haven't done this if
07:47 - you are facing any problem now you are
07:49 - clear with this exercise okay
07:51 - because we have discussed the solution
07:53 - in the next video we'll see what is
07:55 - break and continue and why we use break
07:57 - and continuing Loops so now we'll see in
07:59 - the next video till then bye take care
