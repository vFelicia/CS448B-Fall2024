00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:01 - c we are discussing printing pattern
00:03 - programs in c
00:04 - in this video i'll talk about how to
00:06 - print this pattern first of all we'll
00:08 - see the logic on this whiteboard we'll
00:09 - discuss everything
00:11 - then i'll show you the output on my
00:12 - laptop using vs code editor
00:14 - see it's very easy to print this pattern
00:16 - by looking at this pattern please don't
00:18 - think it's too
00:19 - tough to print first of all let me clear
00:20 - this thing it's very easy to print
00:22 - now why i'm saying this see
00:25 - in the previous two videos i have
00:27 - discussed
00:29 - these patterns like first of all this
00:31 - one
00:38 - see in one video we have discussed how
00:40 - to print this pattern
00:42 - full pyramid right in another video
00:45 - i have discussed how to print this
00:47 - pattern inverted full pyramid these are
00:50 - two different different patterns
00:51 - right and if we combine both the
00:55 - patterns
00:56 - then it will look something like this
00:58 - right but the only difference is
01:00 - here if we combine these two like these
01:03 - pattern
01:04 - then in this i am taking what five
01:08 - number of rows here also we have
01:09 - discussed
01:10 - five number of rows right but you can
01:13 - take whatever you want five ten
01:15 - fifteen twenty right so now here the
01:17 - maximum number of
01:18 - stars are nine right here
01:21 - maximum number of our stars are nine in
01:24 - one row only but
01:26 - if we combine these two pattern then two
01:28 - rows would be there having
01:31 - nine stars this is the only difference
01:34 - if we what if we combine
01:37 - coding to print this pattern and coding
01:40 - to print this pattern
01:42 - means you can print this pattern there
01:45 - would be no space
01:46 - obviously right right
01:49 - but the difference is here we have two
01:52 - number of rows having nine stars
01:54 - the maximum number of stars but i want
01:56 - what only
01:57 - one row that is having maximum star that
02:00 - is nine
02:01 - this is the only difference so you have
02:03 - to change the code a little bit
02:07 - right you can just copy the code of this
02:10 - pyramid this full pyramid as it is and
02:12 - the code of inverted full pyramid you
02:15 - just have to change a little bit
02:17 - there i want to print only one two three
02:20 - four lines not five lines because in
02:22 - five lines i have nine star but i don't
02:24 - want two lines having
02:26 - nine star so one would be
02:30 - like this from here to here this is full
02:32 - pyramid simply you can print the copy of
02:34 - this code
02:35 - and second one is from here to here here
02:38 - we have only four lines means we don't
02:40 - have this line having maximum stars
02:43 - so you can change a little bit this code
02:46 - i hope you are getting my point now i
02:49 - have already discussed
02:50 - this and this please check out the
02:52 - previous videos
02:53 - right i'll put though that uh c com
02:56 - programming list
02:57 - i mean the complete list for c
02:59 - programming link
03:00 - in the description box of this video
03:03 - first of all check
03:04 - out that playlist and check out these
03:06 - two videos
03:07 - now i'm writing the code here directly
03:09 - because i have already discussed i
03:10 - already explained
03:12 - properly the code of this thing right so
03:15 - i'm just writing the code
03:16 - am just combining this code in this code
03:18 - and whatever the change
03:20 - we do that i will discuss it right
03:23 - now see if you remember this
03:27 - this was the code from here to here to
03:30 - print this pyramid
03:32 - full pyramid right and from this
03:36 - for loop to here this word was the code
03:39 - to print this inverted full pyramid
03:42 - right now i have changed here a little
03:45 - bit because
03:46 - here the code was i was i is equal to
03:49 - rows i have done what rows minus 1
03:53 - and i hope you got it why i am doing
03:55 - rows minus 1
03:56 - right because here i want only one line
04:00 - having maximum number of stars i don't
04:02 - want to print this line
04:03 - in inverted
04:07 - full pyramid i want to print only four
04:09 - lines that is why i have initialized i
04:11 - with rows minus one
04:12 - number of rows see rows means total
04:14 - number of rows here i am taking only 5
04:16 - so means rows here are 5 5 minus 4 that
04:19 - is
04:19 - 5 minus 1 that is 4. so this loop would
04:22 - be executed only four times
04:23 - means the outer loop would be executed
04:26 - only four times and the outer loop the
04:27 - highest loop is responsible
04:29 - to take care of these number of lines
04:31 - and here i want to print only four lines
04:33 - in this one
04:35 - right or you can change into this one
04:38 - this loop
04:39 - what you can do you can run this loop
04:41 - only four times from here to here
04:44 - and the inverted full pyramid you can
04:46 - print full like this
04:48 - right so this this change you can do
04:50 - here now here you can do
04:52 - i one i less than equal to rows minus
04:54 - one that's it this loop would be
04:56 - executed only four times
04:57 - either this for this right
05:01 - now maybe you are thinking that in
05:02 - previous video i have told you first of
05:04 - all divide this into number of
05:05 - rows and columns so here we are having
05:07 - how many rows
05:09 - one two three four five six seven
05:12 - eight and nine number of rows right so
05:14 - maybe you are thinking the outer loop
05:16 - should be from one to nine
05:17 - yeah that's exactly we have discussed in
05:19 - previous videos all the previous videos
05:21 - but you have to think differently also
05:23 - right
05:24 - here just combination of this pyramid
05:27 - and inverted full parameter and you will
05:28 - get this thing
05:30 - no need to do like i from one to nine
05:32 - and then how will you print this pattern
05:34 - right you have to think a little bit in
05:37 - a complicated way maybe
05:39 - maybe there are some more ways also
05:41 - rather than just combination of these
05:42 - two patterns maybe there are some
05:44 - different ways also you can also print
05:46 - like this only outer loop would be from
05:49 - one to nine and
05:50 - using some loops or some complicated
05:52 - coding you can print this pattern
05:54 - i agree there can be multiple ways right
05:56 - i am just
05:57 - discussing the simple and only single
06:00 - way here
06:01 - right just combination of these two
06:03 - pattern you will get this thing
06:06 - right now see let me just try run this
06:09 - first of all it will ask from the user
06:11 - enter number of rows you want to print
06:12 - and suppose
06:13 - you number of rows i want to print are
06:16 - five i have entered five
06:18 - right till maximum maximum number
06:22 - here in this line i am getting maximum
06:23 - number of stars
06:25 - so till here how many lines one two
06:27 - three four
06:28 - five right now i is equal to one
06:31 - i would initialize with 1 1 less than
06:34 - equal to number of rows 5 years
06:35 - condition 2 we will enter here space is
06:37 - equal to 1
06:38 - right 1 less than equal to rows minus
06:42 - i rows 5 minus i value is 1 that
06:46 - is 4 one less than equal to four yes
06:48 - condition two will enter here and space
06:49 - would be printed
06:50 - one space would be printed like this the
06:52 - space would be printed
06:54 - right now again space plus plus now the
06:57 - space loop would be executed how many
06:58 - times
06:59 - this is what four four times means four
07:01 - space would be printed one
07:03 - two three four right when space become
07:07 - five
07:07 - condition not true exit from the loop
07:09 - now j loop j is equal to one
07:12 - is one less than equal to two into i
07:14 - minus one i value is 1
07:16 - means 2 minus 1 that is 1 yes condition
07:19 - 2 will enter here and 1 star will be
07:20 - printed
07:22 - now j plus plus that is 2 but this
07:25 - condition is not true
07:26 - exit from the loop and slash and means
07:28 - we'll go into the next line
07:31 - right now it's not like that
07:34 - after this these loop would be executed
07:37 - no we are still
07:38 - into this outer loop outer row right
07:41 - now slash and after that i plus plus now
07:44 - i value becomes 2
07:46 - is 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition
07:48 - true again we will enter here
07:50 - and like this we will execute the this
07:52 - thing
07:53 - till i value becomes the 3 then 4 then 5
07:56 - 5 times it would be executed means still
07:59 - here
08:00 - the pattern would be printed five times
08:02 - five lines
08:03 - right now i become six conditional now
08:06 - exit from this outer loop
08:08 - exit from this outer loop now after this
08:11 - for loop we have this line
08:15 - now these four loop would be executed
08:17 - right
08:18 - now again i value becomes now i value
08:21 - becomes what
08:24 - rows minus 1 number of rows are 5 minus
08:27 - 1
08:28 - 5 minus 1 that is 4. now i value becomes
08:30 - 4
08:31 - right s 4 greater than equal to 1 yes
08:34 - condition tree will enter here now space
08:36 - would be initialized with 1. now 1 less
08:40 - than equal to number of rows minus 1 5
08:42 - minus
08:43 - sorry minus i 5 minus i i value is 4
08:46 - 5 minus 4 1 that is 1 space would be
08:50 - printed means one space would be printed
08:53 - now space plus plus but now space
08:55 - becomes two
08:57 - but this condition is not true only one
08:59 - space would be printed
09:00 - now that's it we exactly want one space
09:03 - now the star loop the loop which will
09:05 - print star that would be executed this
09:07 - loop
09:08 - now j becomes 1 now 1 less than equal to
09:12 - 2 into i minus 1 i value is 4
09:15 - that is 8 minus 1 that is 7
09:18 - yes condition 2 we will enter here 1
09:20 - star would be printed now
09:22 - now j becomes j plus plus that is two
09:24 - now how many times this jl would be
09:26 - executed
09:26 - because here we have condition seven
09:28 - means seven times
09:30 - one two three four five six seven so
09:32 - seven star would be printed
09:34 - when j value becomes eight exit from the
09:36 - loop and
09:38 - in the outer roof slash and so come in
09:40 - the
09:41 - control will come in to the next line
09:44 - right
09:44 - now what i minus minus now pi becomes
09:48 - three now again this condition true we
09:52 - will enter here and again the whole
09:53 - process will be repeated
09:55 - till 3 2 and 1
09:58 - yes 4 times means still here
10:02 - when i value comes 0 this condition is
10:04 - not true
10:05 - then stop it and you will get this
10:08 - pattern
10:09 - right so we have just changed what
10:12 - we have just done i is equal to rows
10:15 - minus 1 here
10:16 - that's it if you print this if you want
10:19 - to print this
10:21 - full pyramid inverted full pyramid you
10:23 - have to initialize with i
10:24 - is equal to rows only total number of
10:26 - rows that's it
10:28 - right and if you want to print this
10:30 - pattern like
10:32 - two rows are having maximum number of
10:34 - stars
10:35 - then no need to change this simply
10:37 - combine the coding for printing this and
10:39 - this
10:39 - that's it no need to change and that we
10:41 - have already discussed
10:42 - right in my previous videos so i hope
10:45 - you would have to print this pattern now
10:47 - let me show you the output
10:49 - so now let me create a new file
10:53 - named pattern 10 dot c
10:56 - right and i'm just combining the
10:59 - previous two pattern
11:01 - right so this was to print the full
11:04 - pyramid
11:06 - just i just copied this one first
11:09 - right and this was to print the inverted
11:12 - full pyramid so here i am not going to
11:14 - completely code the complete one to copy
11:16 - the complete code
11:18 - i am just copying the the logic means
11:20 - from the for loop only
11:26 - right
11:30 - because we don't want header file and
11:32 - those
11:33 - these starting to all three lines again
11:35 - and again right
11:36 - so now i have just combined
11:39 - those two now before any change
11:42 - just i'm just running it and i'll show
11:46 - you the output now see enter number of
11:47 - rows
11:48 - five see here we have
11:52 - these two rows are having maximum number
11:54 - of
11:55 - stars but the actual printing i want in
11:57 - the actual pattern i want only one line
12:00 - right so for this we have to change a
12:02 - little bit
12:04 - you can just do rows minus
12:07 - one in the inverted full pyramid i would
12:10 - be initialized with rows minus 1
12:12 - and that's it now let me just run this
12:16 - and enter number of rows 5 and that's
12:19 - it only one row
12:22 - which is having maximum number of this
12:24 - only maximum number of stars
12:26 - now let me just run this for 10 number
12:29 - of rows
12:31 - and that's exactly you want this pattern
12:35 - right i hope now you got it if you don't
12:38 - want to change here
12:40 - if you want don't want to change here i
12:42 - should be number
12:43 - rows only so one more thing is
12:47 - here you can change in the first one
12:50 - i is equal to 1 and i should be number
12:52 - of rows
12:54 - minus 1 that's it
12:57 - and now let me just show you the output
13:02 - see it is asking number of rows you want
13:06 - to print
13:07 - and i am entering 5 and see you
13:12 - this pattern you are getting right so
13:14 - you can change either into this loop
13:16 - or this loop
13:19 - i hope you got it now
