00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so as you all know it's
00:04 - summer vacation time and I always say
00:06 - don't waste your time invest your time
00:08 - so now it's time to utilize the summer
00:09 - vacation time properly according to me
00:12 - what you can do during this time is you
00:14 - should go for internships whether you
00:17 - are in first year second year or third
00:19 - year see if you are in first year it's
00:21 - optional for you guys you can go for
00:23 - these things but it's mandatory for you
00:25 - if you are in second year or third year
00:27 - right because after if you are in Final
00:30 - year then definitely you are going for
00:32 - placements now right because internships
00:35 - are definitely going to add value to
00:37 - your resume and help you to stand out
00:39 - from the crowd and definitely help you
00:41 - to get a good job right but now the
00:45 - problem is how to get these internships
00:48 - how to apply from where to apply how to
00:51 - search because some colleges are good
00:54 - there companies you know usually come in
00:57 - second year in fourth year in starting
00:59 - of the four fourth year to interview
01:00 - student for internships right and in
01:02 - third year third year as well companies
01:04 - come to interview student for uh
01:06 - internships but in tier three colleges
01:08 - or private universities these are not so
01:10 - good and this type of scenario is not
01:13 - there right so those students will have
01:17 - to apply for internship at their own
01:19 - right they have to search whether it's
01:21 - online or offline internship so now how
01:24 - to apply from where to apply what are
