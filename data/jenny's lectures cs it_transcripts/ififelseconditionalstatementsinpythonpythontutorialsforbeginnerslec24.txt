00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen one coding exercise
00:05 - live in weeks and we have discussed what
00:08 - are up string and based on that we have
00:10 - seen that exercise right
00:12 - so now in this video we'll talk about if
00:14 - statement and if else statement in
00:16 - Python these are known as conditional
00:17 - statements or control statements also we
00:20 - can say decision making statements
00:22 - simple if if else nested if else La LC
00:27 - platter these are decision making
00:29 - statements right or conditional
00:30 - statements
00:31 - so one by one we will discussing these
00:33 - statements in this video we'll talk
00:34 - about if and if else with the help of
00:36 - real life example as well as with the
00:38 - help of program the syntax when we
00:40 - should use if else when we should we
00:42 - should use if statement all the things
00:44 - we'll be discussing in this video right
00:46 - now before they just want to tell you
00:48 - one thing see the journey towards
00:49 - becoming a PSU officer or pursuing mtech
00:52 - from IIT or other Elite Institute is
00:54 - going to be long and challenging
00:56 - so for you to stay focused on your path
00:59 - here are some confidence booster
01:00 - initiative by an academy an academy is
01:03 - going to start Udan batch for gate 2024
01:06 - aspirant and bunyad Bash for 2020
01:09 - five aspirants so here an academy stop
01:12 - educators will be teaching you in these
01:13 - batches and these batches would be in
01:15 - English language both Hindi and English
01:17 - but if you want to attend lectures in
01:19 - complete English language then for you
01:21 - also they have started batches in ignite
01:23 - 2.0 for gate 2024 aspirant and
01:25 - foundation for gate 2020 5 aspirants in

02:10 - your gate and Esa preparation
02:13 - and to Avail these discounts use my code
02:15 - jkl10 so all the relevant links and
02:17 - details you will get in the description
02:18 - box of this video you can go and check
02:20 - out now let's see what are what are the
02:23 - this if else and if statement in Python
02:25 - see let's take one real life example
02:28 - whenever you go to generally you travel
02:30 - in Metro so there is a board like if
02:34 - your child height is less than three
02:37 - feet then no token required right you
02:40 - don't need to purchase any token or
02:42 - ticket anything right but if height is
02:45 - more than three feet three feet then you
02:48 - have to purchase token so there is some
02:50 - condition right
02:52 - in a real life also every day we are
02:54 - facing these type of conditions and
02:56 - based on some conditions we take
02:58 - decisions
02:59 - right like if you go to supermarket and
03:02 - your mom say please bring some you can
03:06 - say buy some apple
03:08 - maybe you'll ask if apples are not
03:10 - available then what should I buy then
03:13 - maybe oranges and if oranges are not
03:16 - available then
03:17 - maybe dragon fruit
03:19 - so there also you have to decide like
03:22 - maybe you are a coffee lover or but
03:25 - based on your pocket money you will have
03:27 - coffee maybe in Starbucks or at some
03:30 - store
03:31 - now that that decision is based on your
03:34 - pocket money right how much money you
03:36 - have so in real life also we are taking
03:39 - multiple you know many decisions every
03:41 - day
03:42 - so when we write program then also
03:45 - obviously we will maybe we are working
03:47 - on a project we'll create some product
03:49 - and all
03:50 - so to map these decision making these
03:53 - things in programming
03:55 - how you can write down these things
03:57 - so for those we have conditional
04:00 - statements using IF else using alif
04:03 - using you know multiple effects
04:04 - necessary fails else if ladder we can
04:07 - map these decisions we can write down
04:09 - these decisions in our programming in
04:12 - program in the form of programs
04:14 - right so that is why these are known as
04:16 - conditional statements or you can say
04:18 - decision making statements
04:20 - fine
04:22 - now that that let's take that that
04:24 - example that height height of your child
04:26 - so if I
04:29 - like if I draw a flowchart then
04:31 - obviously start and here we have a
04:33 - condition height
04:36 - is greater than three feet I am taking
04:40 - height I am taking in feet
04:42 - two condition can be there yes your
04:45 - child height is
04:46 - a greater than three or not or no if yes
04:50 - height is greater than 3 feet then
04:54 - token required
04:56 - to board Metro
04:58 - if no then no token required
05:02 - so this is how we can
05:05 - like we can you know draw a flowchart
05:08 - kind of thing
05:09 - right this is the case
05:12 - so to map this thing in program what we
05:16 - will write if else because here we have
05:19 - two choices yes or no so if or else
05:23 - if apples are there in Supermarket by
05:25 - apples
05:26 - by apples otherwise buy oranges two
05:29 - choices you have
05:31 - right
05:33 - if there is only one choice maybe your
05:36 - mom say if apples are available then buy
05:38 - apples otherwise
05:40 - nothing back to your own come back so
05:44 - that that we can write with simple if no
05:46 - else required but here we have two
05:48 - choices so if and else right
05:51 - now what is this General syntax of
05:54 - writing if simple we will write if and
05:56 - here some condition
05:58 - then Colin then the block of statement
06:01 - that should be executed if this
06:03 - condition is true that would be here we
06:05 - can write down like do this
06:07 - else
06:09 - colon
06:10 - do this
06:12 - right
06:13 - C let me just tell you one thing one
06:17 - thing is very very very important
06:19 - when you write if else in python or when
06:21 - you write programming in Python that is
06:23 - indentation
06:26 - because python basically use indentation
06:30 - to identify a block
06:32 - what is this indentation like if you
06:35 - write this statement then after some
06:38 - space this space
06:39 - before you know in the beginning of this
06:42 - line This is known as indentation right
06:46 - so if we write condition condition you
06:48 - can write down in these brackets also or
06:51 - if you do not put these brackets that is
06:53 - also fine in Python right both the cases
06:56 - are true
06:57 - but this space this indentation is must
07:01 - directly you cannot write down from here
07:03 - do this that will give you error I'll
07:06 - show you with the help of programming
07:07 - right what type of error you will get
07:09 - after else also you have to do some
07:12 - indentation and here if we are writing
07:14 - multiple statement like three statements
07:16 - so all the three statements should be
07:18 - intended
07:20 - leave some space here and then write
07:22 - down these statements right so those
07:24 - statements would be considered as block
07:26 - of statement after if right so this is
07:28 - General syntax of writing if now let me
07:32 - just show you uh this thing with the
07:34 - help of one program and practically
07:36 - we'll see this thing
07:38 - so here obviously this condition should
07:40 - be evaluated and should return either
07:42 - true or false based on true or true or
07:44 - false this the control will go either in
07:48 - this blue Orient this block right so
07:50 - like height greater than 3 so we'll
07:52 - enter height like height is 4 4 is
07:54 - greater than 3 or not yes so that will
07:57 - give you that will give true so true
07:59 - means token required Yes means this way
08:01 - will go right so here we are using these
08:05 - relational operators or we can say
08:06 - comparison operators we have discussed
08:08 - this thing like less than equal to
08:09 - greater than equal to or like less than
08:11 - greater than or double equal to like for
08:15 - equality check we use double equal to or
08:17 - not equal to these are some
08:20 - relational operators for comparison
08:22 - operators we can use while checking some
08:24 - condition while giving here some
08:26 - condition right
08:27 - now let's see with the help of one
08:28 - program and if you want to draw General
08:30 - flowchart for this if else then simply
08:32 - here we rather than height greater than
08:34 - 3 we simply write like condition
08:37 - here condition
08:43 - true
08:45 - or folds two cases can be there right
08:47 - not yes or no true true means here we
08:49 - can write if block statement
08:52 - if block statement would be executed
08:54 - here else block statement would be
08:56 - executed and after that obviously
08:58 - program will
09:00 - you know after whatever statements after
09:02 - those if else block that would be
09:04 - executed right right that would be
09:06 - executed statement out of if else look
09:09 - that would be executed right so this you
09:12 - can say General flowchart of if else
09:13 - right
09:15 - so let's create a new file and we will
09:18 - be discussing if else right so if
09:21 - underscore else dot p y
09:24 - right let's take
09:27 - height
09:28 - so directly when we are taking using
09:31 - input function we can convert that into
09:34 - integer because
09:36 - we know
09:42 - enter height whatever you will take
09:44 - using input function that would be
09:46 - string so convert that into int right
09:50 - now
09:52 - let's check what is the condition if
09:55 - height your child height child sided is
09:58 - uh greater than three feet let me just
10:01 - write down this thing enter height in
10:04 - feet
10:05 - right so if
10:09 - height
10:10 - greater than 3. feet right
10:15 - colon
10:16 - see
10:18 - as you can see whenever
10:21 - the cursor is here and whenever y I will
10:24 - enter I will press enter see
10:26 - automatically the cursor is here
10:28 - there are some space in the beginning of
10:32 - this line so that is what indentation
10:34 - that is very important
10:36 - then
10:38 - print
10:40 - what we should print height is greater
10:42 - than three then
10:44 - token
10:46 - required or we can say by
10:51 - token
10:52 - right
10:54 - enter now
10:56 - else we will write here no indentation
11:00 - before else colon
11:02 - and print
11:05 - note open required right okay let's run
11:08 - this and I'll show you first of all see
11:11 - it is asking enter height in feet I am
11:13 - entering 4.
11:16 - so by token because height is 4 greater
11:20 - than 3 this condition is true so control
11:21 - will enter here and by token
11:24 - right if I again run this and I enter 2
11:30 - then no token required because condition
11:33 - is not true in this case so control will
11:35 - go in else part and no token required so
11:38 - this is simple working of a fence
11:39 - statement now let me just show you
11:42 - something if you do not
11:45 - put here that indentation or the white
11:48 - space then see you can see this red line
11:50 - here and let's run this
11:53 - see
11:56 - this there is something wrong here
11:58 - because this this is some Arrow there is
12:00 - something wrong here so it will give you
12:02 - glue and error is indentation error
12:06 - there are names this is indentational
12:08 - expected and indented block after if
12:10 - statement on line number three
12:13 - so after F there should be some
12:16 - indentation that is indentation block so
12:21 - that should be
12:24 - indented and if I write one more
12:27 - statement like print
12:29 - buy token token and
12:32 - now
12:34 - you can
12:36 - board the Metro
12:39 - right so see these both these statements
12:42 - are intended
12:44 - right so this would be considered as a
12:47 - complete block
12:48 - of statement after if so now if I run
12:51 - this and if I enter height
12:54 - like five so buy token and now you can
12:59 - board the metal these two print
13:01 - statement would be executed because this
13:03 - is now block of statements after if
13:05 - right but after this if I
13:09 - do not put any indented indentation it
13:13 - will give error let's run this
13:15 - C syntax error
13:17 - this is syntax error something here in
13:21 - else part because between if and else
13:23 - this print statement would not be
13:25 - considered now as a part of this if
13:27 - block right but if you are using IF else
13:30 - between if and else there should be
13:33 - nothing
13:34 - right and you are writing this statement
13:36 - so this is wrong
13:39 - better you put this
13:41 - in this block right so I hope you got
13:44 - this thing
13:45 - how to use if else now if simple if
13:48 - rather than else we have only one choice
13:50 - simple if right no else part let's
13:54 - suppose remove the sales part comment
13:56 - this out
13:59 - if height is greater than 3
14:03 - then buy a token and
14:08 - this thing that is only case no else
14:10 - part let's run this
14:13 - greater than 3 means six so buy token
14:17 - now you can board the metro and if this
14:19 - is less than three like two nothing
14:21 - would be printed because there is no
14:23 - else part but but if I write one more
14:26 - line something like this
14:29 - print
14:32 - out of if
14:36 - block
14:37 - the statement is out of fifth law
14:39 - because there is no indentation here
14:40 - let's run this
14:42 - and height is now I'm entering two so
14:45 - now it will print out of if block this
14:48 - print statement only because these two
14:50 - print statement would be considered as
14:52 - part of this if because these are
14:53 - intended this is not intended so this is
14:56 - out of it if I do not put any
14:58 - indentation here so now this only would
15:01 - be part of this if block these two are
15:03 - not part of if block let's run this and
15:06 - if I enter 6.
15:10 - so height is greater than
15:12 - 6 is greater than 3 so only one line
15:15 - would be printed by token that's it
15:16 - right sorry buy token and now there is
15:20 - no else part so these two statements are
15:22 - part of program only so obviously after
15:25 - if those statement would be executed
15:28 - that are part of program normal
15:29 - execution of program would be there so
15:31 - these three statements would be executed
15:34 - right and if I run this and if I enter
15:37 - like height is 2
15:39 - now only
15:40 - 2 statement would be executed now you
15:43 - can board the metro and out of if block
15:44 - these two only
15:46 - because now this print by token is part
15:48 - of the sift block right and if you do
15:51 - not put like these sorry the these
15:54 - brackets that is also fine
15:57 - because I am actually from C and C plus
15:58 - plus background so that is why I used to
16:01 - put these brackets let's run this there
16:04 - would be no error right height is 3 if I
16:08 - enter height 3 because 3 Less Than 3 no
16:12 - condition is not true
16:15 - so now know if block these two statement
16:17 - would be would be executed right
16:20 - let's do this thing
16:26 - and let's comment this out
16:28 - and if you want to put that condition
16:30 - also like if your child height is
16:31 - greater than or equal to 3
16:34 - then you have to buy a token
16:37 - Less Than 3 then we need to buy so less
16:40 - than equal to greater than equal to this
16:41 - and you can put or if double equal to
16:43 - you want to check equality then double
16:45 - equal to also we can check but for
16:46 - equality you have to use double equal to
16:48 - not single equal to that is not
16:51 - that would be sub there would be some
16:52 - some error like if I put only one one
16:56 - equal to I want to check equality if
16:58 - height is equal to 3 but I
17:00 - only put one equal to so there would be
17:03 - some error let let me just run this and
17:05 - see
17:07 - it is showing here are some error if
17:09 - white is equal to syntax error invalid
17:10 - syntax maybe you meant double equal to
17:13 - or this instead of this so it is giving
17:16 - you some clue also you can read out
17:18 - these error and you can check where is
17:20 - the error so here it should must be some
17:22 - error
17:23 - so maybe it's not not equal to what
17:26 - double equal to which will be double
17:28 - equal to now it is there would be no
17:30 - error right
17:32 - if I enter write 4 then no token
17:35 - required because condition is not true
17:38 - height is not equal to 3 right so I hope
17:40 - now you got basics of if and if else
17:43 - statements and how to use them and what
17:45 - is indentation and how this indentation
17:47 - is important if before the site before
17:50 - writing this if we put space
17:53 - see here also in Python it will give
17:56 - error you cannot put
17:58 - any space before beginning of any line
18:01 - you can put space after
18:04 - you know at starting of those statement
18:06 - which are part of if block or else block
18:08 - right till now we have discussed till
18:11 - now if else on your if so see it will
18:14 - give error
18:16 - indentation error unexpected intent here
18:19 - height this this is the first line on
18:22 - unexpected intent so do not put any
18:25 - space here
18:26 - right so I hope you got what is if and
18:29 - what as if else how to use them when to
18:32 - use them and how to write down this
18:33 - thing in your program so in the next
18:35 - video we'll see when coding exercise
18:36 - based on these FL statements when I will
18:38 - say the next video till then bye take
18:40 - care
