00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - C++ programming language we are
00:05 - discussing vectors in C++ in the
00:06 - previous video we have seen different
00:08 - different functions what we can perform
00:09 - on vectors the member functions right
00:12 - now uh we'll be seeing two to three
00:15 - problems like you can say coding
00:16 - exercises on vectors right so these are
00:20 - three uh questions first this is the
00:22 - vector from 1 to 10 and you have to
00:24 - erase all the even numbers from this
00:26 - Vector right in next question we have
00:28 - two vectors and you have to swap the
00:30 - values of these two vectors next is this
00:33 - is the vector and you have to sort this
00:36 - Vector right so take the screenshot of
00:39 - these three questions pause the video
00:42 - and try this out right now now before
00:44 - jumping to the solution I just want to
00:45 - share an exciting news for all the gate
00:47 - aspirant see yesterday there was an
00:49 - event of unacademy gate Champions
00:50 - conclave 2024 the link of that event
00:53 - also I have shared on my Instagram story
00:55 - day before yesterday and in my telegram
00:58 - uh Channel also I hope many of you you
01:00 - have joined their live stream and you
01:01 - have watched that event it was a great
01:26 - event where they have invited all the
01:29 - top rankers great rankers all India rank
01:31 - one all India rank three who were
01:33 - students of an Academy of all the
01:36 - branches right so maybe you can also be
01:38 - a part of this kind of event maybe next
01:41 - year just by starting from the you know
01:43 - best of the Educators in the industry
01:46 - with an academy so here comes what is
01:48 - the exciting news because unacademy is
01:50 - conducting a unacademy scholarship test
01:53 - for gate 2025 on 24th of March at 11:00
01:57 - a.m. and time limit would be 45 minutes
01:59 - and you will get question in this test
02:01 - and this was to curated by their top
02:02 - Educators right and you can enroll for
02:05 - this test freely this is the best part
02:06 - you don't need to pay anything to take
02:08 - this test right plus one more thing what
02:10 - is so special about this test you have a
02:12 - chance to win up to 100% scholarship and
02:14 - some other rewards also like you have a
02:16 - chance to win Amazon vouchers worth
02:18 - worth rupes th000 monthly free test with
02:20 - 30 practice questions so how to enroll
02:23 - for this test enrollment link I'll put
02:24 - in the description box of this video
02:25 - just click on that link and this type of
02:27 - page will be open in front of you right
02:29 - you just have have to enter your mobile
02:31 - number and when whenever you click on
02:33 - enroll for free you'll get an OTP and
02:35 - just verify on that thing right you just
02:39 - verify the OTP so if you want to prepare
02:40 - for gate 2025 better to start early so
02:43 - all the U relevant link and detail I'll
02:45 - put in the description box of this video
02:47 - you can go and check out now let's get
02:50 - back to the solution part of our
02:52 - question so I hope you have done these
02:55 - three exercises two are very simple one
02:57 - is little bit difficult the first one
03:00 - if not it's okay let's try this out so
03:02 - we're going to create a new file
03:04 - first so Vector values are given from 1
03:08 - to 10 and you have to erase only even
03:10 - numbers so yeah we have a function
03:13 - number function erase we can use that in
03:15 - CPP uh
03:16 - sorry in C++ in STL we have this
03:19 - function eras right so you can pass here
03:24 - like a position the position on which
03:27 - you want to delete the element right
03:29 - right itat position or in a Range also
03:32 - we can pass from first to last the first
03:35 - is included last one is not included
03:37 - right okay so for even we have to find
03:40 - out first like
03:42 - even we will first make an iterator okay
03:45 - because you have to iterator is like
03:47 - obviously is going to point the element
03:51 - so iterator will will give us the
03:53 - position the location right and in erase
03:55 - function we pass obviously the position
03:57 - iterator right so let's create an
04:01 - first for the
04:04 - vector v and which is of type int right
04:09 - so same type we are going to take then
04:11 - this and iterator let's suppose the name
04:16 - I'm taking it or any name you can take
04:18 - righty okay not righty right fine now
04:24 - let's suppose this it this iterator is
04:27 - at first we are pointing this to the
04:31 - vector v dot
04:34 - begin in beginning right now the cator
04:36 - is pointing to here right so find out
04:40 - the even number and erase those
04:42 - number so we'll do let's take a y Loop
04:46 - while this
04:47 - iterator not equal
04:49 - to V do end till then obviously we are
04:53 - going to repeat this while loop right
04:57 - now what in while loop we will do so
04:59 - let's check if
05:02 - if the iterator which is pointing to the
05:05 - location on that location if the value
05:08 - is even and how to check mode 2 is equal
05:11 - to equal to Z if the value is even then
05:15 - delete it otherwise just increase just
05:18 - you can say increment the iterator right
05:22 - okay if now how to get the uh value from
05:26 - uh that location we have a d referencing
05:28 - operator S2
05:31 - if estri it so it will give us the value
05:35 - right
05:37 - mode 2 = to equal
05:42 - to0 if this is the
05:44 - case then only we'll call erase function
05:49 - means on this Vector let's call erase
05:52 - and in erase we just pass the iterator
05:54 - means from this position you have to
05:57 - delete the element
06:00 - otherwise we are going to just do what
06:05 - increment the iterator it
06:08 - ++ if erase that element like if
06:11 - iterator is at two then it will it is
06:14 - going to erase this element to right in
06:17 - that case no it ++ because after erasing
06:21 - this element has been destroyed and
06:23 - these all these elements would be
06:25 - repositioned relocated so three would be
06:28 - here four would be here here like one
06:30 - position before right so no need to
06:33 - increment the iterator after two now
06:36 - iterator is here and it is pointing to
06:38 - three right but that if it is not even
06:42 - number like one it is at first at one
06:45 - but this is not even number so increment
06:46 - the now it is at two right then erase it
06:50 - okay I hope you got this so you can just
06:53 - dry run this thing write down this code
06:56 - on a piece of paper and dry run this and
06:59 - after that just print the vector so we
07:03 - we have many method to print the vector
07:06 - one more we'll discuss in this video
07:07 - that I think we have forgot to discuss
07:09 - we can use a range based for Loop right
07:13 - so Auto means it it will automatically
07:15 - detect the data type suppose I'm taking
07:18 - uh any variable name n and from vector
07:24 - v or Auto element here anything a BC
07:28 - element or anything right but this is
07:31 - from where you want to take the values
07:32 - from Vector the name is V so here should
07:35 - be V right now one by one we are going
07:39 - to print C out just
07:42 - n with some
07:44 - space
07:48 - right so at first you know the working
07:51 - of range based for loop from V first the
07:54 - one first element would be assigned to
07:56 - this variable n then one would be
07:58 - printed the next element next element
08:00 - next element till the end of that
08:03 - container obviously Vector is a
08:06 - container so let's run this I hope it
08:12 - works
08:15 - okay I just selected that thing let's
08:17 - run this see 1 3 5 7
08:23 - 9 all even number has been erased right
08:28 - I hope you got this this was not so much
08:29 - stuff let's try now the second one so
08:33 - these two Vector we have and you have to
08:34 - swap the values of these things so
08:36 - simply we have a member function swap
08:39 - you can just check out here uh I think
08:42 - uh we haven't discussed this swap in
08:44 - previous video so let's discuss this
08:45 - thing it is going to exchange the the
08:48 - content of container by the content of X
08:50 - which is another Vector object of the
08:52 - same type size May differ right okay if
08:54 - you're not getting in simple definition
08:56 - we are going to swap the element of
08:58 - vector one with Vector 2 or vector 2
09:00 - with Vector one you can say like this
09:03 - right so let's call this suppose on
09:06 - Vector one or vector 2 we can call vect
09:08 - 1 dot Swap and in bracket with which
09:12 - Vector I want to swap vect
09:16 - two and simply print for Vector one and
09:18 - Vector two range based for Loop we can
09:20 - take we can use or iterator we can use
09:22 - or anything we can use using at you can
09:26 - uh access all the elements at function
09:29 - many ways are there to access the values
09:31 - of these
09:32 - vectors so just call Swap and we are
09:34 - just printing using range range based
09:37 - function these two vectors let's run
09:39 - this and see what you are
09:42 - getting okay let's
09:44 - just write
09:47 - down Vector one and Vector 2 after swap
09:50 - so that you can just you can understand
09:54 - it okay let's just use a slash and here
09:59 - or andle you can
10:01 - [Applause]
10:04 - use see Vector one after swap is this
10:07 - Vector two after swap is this but before
10:09 - swapping this 1 2 3 4 this was Vector
10:11 - one this was Vector 2 so it's very
10:13 - simple right now third sorting just call
10:16 - an algorithm Sol but for that we have to
10:21 - include another header which
10:24 - is
10:26 - algorithm this header here we we have
10:29 - all those algorithms searching sorting
10:31 - and all right
10:34 - so so for sorting also you don't need to
10:37 - write down the complete code for sorting
10:40 - right we simply have a function a m
10:43 - function sort you can just call that and
10:45 - this Vector would be sorted so this is
10:47 - like beauty of using STL right it is
10:49 - going to save a lot of your time right
10:53 - so just call this C
10:57 - sort but if you do not include this
11:01 - algorithm
11:03 - sorry this header we are not able to use
11:07 - this sort see s o r t there is no sort
11:09 - right
11:11 - now so you have to include this header
11:14 - algorithm to use all the algorithms
11:17 - right from that STM sort and what is the
11:20 - syntax from beginning to end you want to
11:22 - sort right see random excess of uh
11:25 - iterator first and then last so from
11:28 - beginning to end
11:31 - so from V the vector name is here vect
11:36 - one so vect 1 dot begin from begin to V
11:42 - sorry 1 dot end from beginning to end we
11:45 - want to perform
11:48 - sorting and simply we can
11:51 - just print the vector one the values of
11:54 - all the vector one after sorting let's
11:57 - run this and see what output you are
11:59 - getting here see -1 2 4 10 60 79 sorted
12:04 - Vector right so these I think two was
12:06 - very simple right first one was a little
12:09 - bit tricky and obviously this one we
12:12 - haven't discussed swep and SW that is
12:14 - why we have we have discussed right now
12:16 - the coding exercises on these algorithms
12:19 - and these member function right I hope
12:22 - you got this right so that's it for this
12:25 - video now I'll see you in the next video
12:27 - then bye-bye take care
