04:45 - view playing this at the show well I'm
04:48 - very excited to see seed so seed is
04:50 - Bible in based clan games and the first
04:53 - thing that I dreamy - it was its
04:54 - minimalistic art style I absolutely
04:55 - loved it and it's actually quite
04:57 - deceiving because the art style does not
04:59 - sort of portray everything that is in
05:02 - this game sector it's a sandbox MMO in
05:05 - which players can create their own
05:07 - ecosystems so you have a seedling and
05:10 - you can cultivate that seedling a
05:12 - seedling has wants and needs like human
05:14 - beings and you cultivate and listen to
05:17 - your seedlings you can like create your
05:19 - own colony and have relationships
05:21 - develop there and this those like
05:24 - cultivations also take out going on when
05:27 - you're not playing so it's just one of
05:29 - those games I'm going to think ours into
05:31 - I just think I am also and as I said
05:34 - it's not just games in the made with
05:35 - unity showcase of course we have median
05:39 - entertainment - so the scene the scene
05:42 - that you can see now is a kites tail by
05:44 - Walt Disney Animation Studios so this is
05:49 - the second short animation virtual
05:52 - reality animation so this is all
05:54 - hand-drawn animations brought into the
05:56 - medium of VR which is very very exciting
05:58 - and just looks beautiful and it's also
06:00 - very Disney in its story it's about two
06:02 - kites as you can see a very different
06:04 - that just learn to live together and
06:07 - coexist beautifully I guess other
06:15 - projects and other creators their
06:16 - creative process and all that good stuff
06:18 - on the made with unity website which is
06:20 - made with unity calm marvelous and
06:24 - obviously we wanted to give a big shout
06:26 - out to the rest of the unity indie
06:27 - community that's not been featured just
06:29 - now so we put together this indie
06:31 - celebration real for you to take a look
06:33 - at some of those great games let's take
06:34 - a look at it right now
07:35 - tons and tons of great unity talent
07:38 - going out into those games thanks so
07:40 - much for doing what you do we absolutely
07:41 - love all of them list you know I love
07:44 - about those games what's that graphics
07:47 - well there's a good job that you enjoy
07:49 - graphic yeah look who we have with us oh
07:52 - my goodness it's IRISA Scott our product
07:54 - manager for graphics what an incredible
07:56 - coincidence hi IRISA hi will how are you
07:58 - doing really good thank you for joining
08:00 - us we won't keep you long cuz I know
08:02 - you're gonna be spilling some graphical
08:04 - beans in the keynote itself so I want to
08:07 - dive right in there
08:09 - Universal window pipeline mmm previously
08:12 - referred to as the lightweight winter
08:13 - pipeline and so they're not two separate
08:16 - entities nope so in 2019 point three we
08:19 - have renamed lightweight to Universal so
08:22 - lightweight was originally a more
08:23 - targeted solution focused on mobile
08:25 - being super performant and a little bit
08:27 - more of a narrow focus and its feature
08:29 - set is grown and it's evolved it's still
08:31 - super performance but it offers like
08:32 - fantastic visuals and more flexibility
08:34 - so all lightweight users when they get
08:37 - 20 19.3 from their point of view it's a
08:39 - name change with more features awesome
08:41 - so what differentiates that from from
08:43 - our built in a renderer for example more
08:46 - flexibility it's also more performant so
08:50 - because it's a single forward pass
08:52 - renderer
08:52 - you know we've got some exciting stats
08:54 - in the keynote and there are a lot of
08:56 - artists tools like VFX graph and shader
08:58 - graph we also have a new post-processing
09:00 - stack which is integrated directly into
09:02 - Universal gives you more performance and
09:05 - also you know beautiful visuals awesome
09:07 - speaking of beautiful visuals we're
09:08 - taking a look at the spaceship demo
09:10 - right now
09:10 - and this is H GRP right so what's the
09:13 - difference there with HDR P what kind of
09:15 - ad add-ons on top of what you would get
09:17 - with Universal could you
09:19 - so HDR P is more targeted compute
09:22 - capable platforms are high in platforms
09:24 - like Xbox ps4 and you have things like
09:27 - volume metrics
09:29 - and a much richer PBR that is even more
09:33 - realistic than what we offer in
09:34 - Universal and a lot of other great
09:36 - features like subsurface scattering and
09:38 - all the other acronyms you might want
09:42 - and and like here we're seeing a lot of
09:46 - great VFX graph work for this demo oh
09:49 - yeah and we have good news about the FX
09:52 - graph right it's now working with shader
09:53 - both yeah so you can offer your shaders
09:55 - and so I trade your graph use those
09:56 - directly and VFX graph to get even more
09:59 - gorgeous effects awesome
10:01 - so Liz ray tracing I don't know why you
10:06 - asking me Arisa tell us a little bit
10:09 - more about ray tracing I know that we've
10:11 - previously released blog post about this
10:13 - but can you tell us a little bit more
10:14 - about what we can expect and how we can
10:16 - get our hands on it so you can download
10:18 - 29.3 and use HD RP our ray tracing
10:21 - solution is built directly on top of a
10:23 - CRP so if you have that package just
10:26 - upgrade and it'll be there
10:27 - it'll be there and if you have the
10:29 - hardware then you'll be able to kind of
10:31 - scale upwards even further and you don't
10:33 - once have it work with both HD RP and
10:36 - with ray tracing and a nice thing about
10:38 - our solution for ray tracing is it's the
10:41 - final frame entirely an editor so you're
10:43 - seeing ray tracing within the editor yep
10:45 - and so you can kind of iterate much
10:47 - faster very cool well it's nearly keno
10:50 - time so I think you should probably
10:54 - [Music]
11:00 - I love having a guest I think we have
11:04 - another guest and you know from one Hot
11:07 - Topic graphics to another one of the
11:09 - hottest topics in gaming at the moment
11:11 - is cloud based gaming and to talk to us
11:12 - a little bit more about that we have
11:14 - some your Peterson farm stadia thank you
11:16 - so much for joining us thanks so much
11:18 - for having me really excited to be here
11:20 - at unite so the Google stadia service
11:23 - launches in November for players but
11:25 - obviously your audience right now and
11:27 - back here is unity developers so what
11:29 - advice do you have for unity developers
11:31 - and how do they get onto the stadia
11:33 - platform sure so the good news is we've
11:35 - been working with unity for over a year
11:37 - now so we're almost there
11:39 - and back at GDC this year we launched
11:41 - the stadia partnerships program if you
11:44 - haven't heard about it it's a program
11:46 - that we've generated to engage with
11:48 - developers regardless of their size so
11:51 - support opportunities range from
11:53 - financial to production support to
11:55 - marketing and we really tailor those to
11:58 - the individual opportunity and the
12:00 - individual developer so you're kind of
12:02 - solving some of the kind of like
12:03 - publishing aspects of getting the game
12:05 - out absolutely Italy about helping them
12:08 - bring their games to market in the best
12:10 - way possible
12:10 - sweet that sounds like an incredible
12:12 - opportunity how like what advice would
12:15 - you give to any of the developers who
12:16 - are watching that want to take advantage
12:17 - of this partnership absolutely so first
12:21 - and foremost it'll surprise you to learn
12:22 - that we're looking for games people want
12:25 - to play right so he amongst that is that
12:28 - they're playable so we're looking for
12:29 - games that are in development and more
12:31 - important than that is we're really
12:34 - interested in developers who want to
12:37 - take full advantage of the power of
12:40 - stadia so either the backend or some of
12:42 - our YouTube integration features you
12:44 - might have 300 enemies in a battle on
12:47 - screen and a single instance or you
12:49 - could use crowd boost crowd play or
12:52 - state share which are some of our
12:54 - youtube integrations that you can read
12:56 - all about those on our blog I was gonna
12:58 - say if you want to find out they can go
13:00 - to stadia
13:01 - yeah stadia Devi's where you go to learn
13:03 - about those so what is the actual
13:05 - application process like how to people
13:06 - what's it going to be like they want to
13:08 - apply it they've got a want to show you
13:11 - today sure so the initial application
13:13 - process is really important that's where
13:16 - we're getting to learn about you as a
13:17 - developer so you need to submit your web
13:21 - domain your developer background we want
13:24 - gameplay footage or early playable we're
13:28 - obviously looking for developers with
13:30 - recent history in certified storefronts
13:34 - experience in consoles is very
13:36 - interesting it's not a prerequisite but
13:38 - it's definitely a nice to have and
13:40 - clearly we'd like developers from unity
13:42 - and with expertise in unity incredible
13:45 - so people can head to stay be a dev to
13:47 - find out more about partnership but also
13:49 - about the stadia features right
13:51 - absolutely had to stadia to register
13:53 - your interest well have a great show
13:55 - Samuel thank you so much for joining us
13:57 - and good luck finding all of this talent
13:59 - out here yeah thanks very much you so
14:01 - much cool so we are going to pivot back
14:04 - to unity for a moment now so Liz I don't
14:08 - know about you but I've used unity since
14:09 - like 2008 because I'm very very old and
14:12 - it's always kind of look the same
14:15 - so thankfully in 20 19.3 we're getting a
14:17 - bit of a restyle thanks to this lady
14:20 - Mary Luther hi Mary
14:23 - hey well nice suit thank you so much for
14:26 - joining us Thanks so why are we doing
14:31 - this now it's been a long time it's been
14:33 - how long did you tell me earlier well
14:35 - it's been about 14 years and we've had
14:36 - the same style in the editor pretty much
14:38 - the whole time
14:39 - yeah and so unity is growing a lot and
14:41 - as you're gonna see a unite we have more
14:43 - awesome teams than ever creating new
14:45 - features for unity true so it's really
14:47 - important that we have a system that is
14:49 - cohesive and consistent so that
14:51 - everything can work together yeah and so
14:53 - how did she get started with the
14:55 - redesign what was the process yeah so
14:58 - the first thing we did was just talk to
14:59 - users and what we found when we did this
15:02 - is kind of like we could categorize them
15:04 - to three main areas so the first major
15:06 - area was just that people told us that
15:08 - the editor felt really dated like you
15:10 - guys were just talking about so we did
15:12 - user research to find out more and
15:15 - really sit down listen and observe
15:17 - people working in unity to see how these
15:19 - things affected the usability of the
15:21 - product so what people told us is that
15:23 - they felt that the editor was actually
15:24 - less usable and had a lower quality
15:27 - because just of the way it looked
15:28 - it's like a pop perception thing as well
15:31 - yeah totally we call it aesthetic
15:33 - usability in the in the UX world and
15:36 - then of course we had real kind of
15:37 - usability issues related to people kind
15:40 - of losing the context of where they were
15:41 - in the editor so that's kind of the
15:43 - second main area okay yeah okay so like
15:45 - am I in the hierarchy am I in the scene
15:47 - view and then I added the inspector and
15:49 - then I've edited the wrong thing and
15:50 - then I'm angry those kind of issues and
15:53 - then the third one was just lots of
15:55 - little inconsistencies like everywhere
15:57 - and little usability issues so like text
16:00 - it was just too small to read yeah or
16:02 - too late
16:03 - to see lots of things just slightly out
16:05 - of alignment and just like a million
16:07 - other little inconsistencies yeah for
16:12 - sure
16:12 - I mean we can we can see the the
16:14 - redesign on screen right now and we can
16:16 - hopefully show you a little video clip
16:18 - of the side-by-side between nineteen to
16:20 - and nineteen three so tell us a little
16:22 - bit about the differences we've got here
16:24 - obviously there's a bit of a flat design
16:26 - compared to the old look yeah so one
16:29 - thing that's really common right now is
16:30 - modern apps are sort of taking over the
16:32 - landscape of tech is everybody's going
16:34 - flat and so that could be actually
16:36 - really bad for usability if you go to
16:37 - flat it's really hard to tell the
16:39 - difference between a text input and a
16:41 - drop-down and it can really kind of mess
16:43 - you up so the challenge for us was to
16:45 - add an up like settle depth cues to
16:47 - support usability while really making a
16:50 - nice modern style yeah it feels like
16:52 - like and I think like we got a lot of
16:54 - feedback on the form as well that there
16:55 - was you know like a good compromise
16:57 - between the flat and you know adding
17:00 - those cues for people yeah so one of
17:02 - those things when we were kind of
17:03 - thinking about this as we talk to users
17:06 - and we did a lot of refinement and
17:07 - iteration on the on the forums and also
17:09 - via surveys to kind of get things at
17:11 - like a really good level of detail
17:13 - because that's what this kind of an
17:14 - effort takes and then like the other
17:17 - thing that we did was we added over the
17:19 - past couple releases things like tab
17:21 - focus yeah and hover and I mean all
17:24 - these things have come in over the last
17:26 - couple so they're not new for 20 19.3
17:28 - but they've been all part of this effort
17:30 - so we've added them as soon as we
17:31 - technically can and that's been really
17:34 - helpful so that when you actually are
17:35 - you know modifying an object and editing
17:37 - in the inspector you're like less likely
17:39 - to make a mistake which is may has made
17:41 - me feel better working in unity I like
17:43 - lose don't lose my place as often as I
17:45 - used to exactly sounds amazing and so
17:48 - what's actually coming next you know
17:49 - we've seen 19.3 and what that looks like
17:51 - what's coming up in the future of the
17:53 - editor as far as you're concerned twenty
17:56 - 19.3 is actually just the first stage of
17:59 - kind of like a bigger effort to continue
18:01 - modernizing the editor and so the next
18:04 - things we really want to focus on our
18:05 - usability accessibility and then of
18:08 - course use our workflows to make kind of
18:10 - unity a better experience for as many
18:12 - types of users as possible
18:15 - and we're just gonna listen to the user
18:16 - so we're gonna let the users lead us
18:18 - where they lead us in these areas and
18:21 - we're gonna just continue to kind of
18:23 - reach out and talk to them on the forums
18:25 - and I do actually want to say thanks
18:27 - everybody over the past year out there
18:30 - that kind of worked with us on the
18:31 - forums filled out like the three million
18:33 - surveys on theming that we put out
18:35 - because all that feedback we were able
18:37 - to make most the majority of those
18:39 - changes that's pretty much all I've done
18:40 - for the past year was listen to feedback
18:42 - and make stuff better yeah cool so of
18:53 - course the editor theme isn't the only
18:54 - thing that's coming to make your life
18:55 - better in unity we have a ton of quality
18:58 - of life improvements coming to the
18:59 - editor very soon and we've put together
19:01 - a quick trailer to show you some of the
19:03 - great things that are coming up in 19.3

21:29 - you
21:35 - please welcome cats Trafford
21:45 - [Applause]
21:48 - welcome to unite Copenhagen we are so
21:51 - excited that you all are here one of the
21:54 - things that makes unities community so
21:57 - unique and special is that people come
21:59 - from everywhere to come together at
22:01 - unite share ideas share the latest
22:04 - technology collaborate and make new
22:07 - friends so thank you all for joining us
22:09 - we have a really exciting week ahead so
22:12 - we want to extend a big welcome not just
22:14 - to everyone in the room here but also to
22:16 - everyone on the livestream we hope
22:19 - you're gonna enjoy the show with us and
22:20 - we also would like to welcome all the
22:23 - speakers all the demo airs partners and
22:26 - the people who brought this all together
22:28 - and made it possible so welcome
22:39 - so we have a week full of a hundred and
22:43 - fifty sessions tons and tons of demos
22:47 - across the expo floor as well as unite
22:51 - at night that I hope you all make it to
22:53 - and of course the one thing you've asked
22:56 - a lot for which is more time and more
22:58 - experts at the expert bar so before I
23:02 - move on though I want to take a special
23:04 - minute to or second to recognize our
23:07 - beta testers where are you are you right
23:09 - here yes thank you thanks for making
23:12 - unity better every day and helping
23:14 - everyone enjoy it we really appreciate
23:16 - all that you do
23:24 - you guys are kind of grinning sheepishly
23:27 - but we really appreciate it thank you
23:29 - all right so tonight John is gonna share
23:31 - how the power of real-time 3d is
23:34 - transforming the way we all create Lucas
23:37 - and team are gonna share more about our
23:40 - data oriented tech stack timoney and
23:43 - team are going to share around our AR
23:45 - toolset including Mars AR foundation and
23:50 - some new features that we haven't shared
23:51 - yet Danny and team
23:54 - sorry just Danny actually he's gonna
23:56 - share more around simulation an erisa
24:01 - and team are going to demonstrate our
24:02 - latest on graphics including 2d features
24:06 - our new scriptable render pipelines as
24:08 - well as a few other surprises and we're
24:12 - going to hear from some special guests
24:13 - so let's dive in
24:20 - who first shared their stories in caves
24:24 - connected art nature and science led us
24:29 - toward new horizons who thought to
24:34 - capture motion
24:36 - sparking engine to life turn television
24:40 - into a playground every day you create
24:44 - the playful
24:46 - the functional and the unexpected you
24:52 - break down walls and take us to
24:56 - astonishing places tell stories leave
25:02 - borders
25:03 - and create beauty for tomorrow because
25:08 - at Unity we believe the world is a
25:11 - better place with more creators in it
25:13 - where everyone has a chance to shape the
25:18 - world
25:22 - please welcome John Ricca Telo
25:33 - [Music]
25:35 - good evening and welcome to unite in
25:38 - Copenhagen on behalf of everybody at
25:40 - Unity we welcome you all here and we're
25:42 - thrilled to be here it was only a couple
25:45 - kilometers away from here where it all
25:47 - started when fifteen years ago the very
25:49 - first lines of unity were written now
25:52 - together with all of you an amazing
25:54 - group of developer partners and
25:55 - customers we've achieved more than we
25:58 - ever thought possible
25:59 - we built a better game engine and you've
26:01 - built amazing games today games built on
26:06 - unity account for approximately 50
26:08 - percent of all games on every platform
26:10 - in every country in the world in just
26:13 - the last 12 months games you've built
26:16 - were downloaded 34 billion times think
26:21 - about that for a minute if you do the
26:23 - math that's 53 downloads of a unity
26:26 - based game the stuff you build every
26:29 - second 30 53 per second and over this
26:33 - time our industry has entered its golden
26:36 - era today gaming is a hundred and fifty
26:39 - billion dollar industry far surpassing
26:43 - film and music to become the largest
26:44 - entertainment medium on the planet and
26:46 - we've gotten there through great games
26:49 - like inside by play dead sayonara wild
26:52 - hearts or Nintendo's Mario Kart tour
26:55 - from you and collectively we surpassed
26:58 - these other media through innovation
27:00 - taking advantage of the massive increase
27:02 - in compute power and networks to help
27:04 - you deliver Brown groundbreaking content
27:07 - and it gets better from here the
27:11 - constraints we face you're falling away
27:12 - with magnitudes better performance
27:15 - processing streaming the evolution of
27:18 - technology will part power gaming
27:20 - farther than ever before and because
27:23 - we're the enablers of the most important
27:25 - or one of the most important and
27:27 - significant technologies of our time
27:28 - real-time 3d mastery of real-time 3d
27:33 - technology and tools means you can be
27:35 - the agents of change for the gaming
27:37 - industry but our shared technology that
27:40 - we use to make games has also helped us
27:42 - become the leading entertainment media
27:43 - in the world and will take us to other
27:45 - industries as well
27:46 - real-time 3d is already proving to be
27:50 - invaluable across industries that help
27:52 - design build and sell the most complex
27:55 - projects ranging from cars to airplanes
27:58 - to skyscrapers such as designing and
28:01 - testing augmented reality experiences
28:03 - that don't exist yet
28:04 - like Volvo has done with Vario or how a
28:07 - construction company
28:08 - Mortenson created in design medical
28:11 - operation Suites in VR before
28:13 - constructing such critical venues in
28:15 - real life or Bill Bell building virtual
28:17 - prototypes of the FCX helicopter for
28:20 - design and test piloting you are the
28:24 - pioneers of the real-time 3d revolution
28:27 - this is a revolution transforming all
28:30 - content all creation across dozens of
28:33 - industries and you started it that which
28:36 - is static will move that which was not
28:40 - social will be connected that which was
28:42 - 2d and flat will be 3d real-time and
28:45 - immersive it's game makers like you and
28:48 - pioneers and other industries many of
28:50 - them here tonight at unite that will
28:52 - lead the world into the next realm of
28:54 - creative possibility so get ready to
28:57 - shape the world now before we welcome
28:59 - Lucas to the stage please join me in
29:01 - taking a look at some of the incredible
29:02 - things you've made with unity
29:37 - [Music]
29:43 - [Music]
29:56 - please welcome Lucas Mayer
30:06 - good see well here I get to talk about
30:10 - our data oriented technology stack a
30:14 - gentleman here heard about it and when
30:17 - when he heard about it he probably heard
30:20 - us talk about performance performance
30:22 - performance performance and performance
30:24 - by default in particular the reason we
30:27 - talk about that so much is because we
30:30 - focus on it because it's the one part of
30:32 - the game engine that you cannot add back
30:34 - later on however what about convenience
30:40 - let's talk about some programmer
30:42 - convenience if you're a programmer that
30:44 - once you used us today
30:45 - you kind of start like this you make a
30:47 - component but to use it in the editor
30:50 - you have to make this authoring
30:51 - components to make it do something you
30:53 - need to make a system to make it do that
30:55 - fast you need to make a job and then to
30:58 - run the job you need to schedule that
30:59 - job so you could say well I don't know
31:02 - Lucas that sounds like a lot of work to
31:05 - move something around and you'd be kind
31:08 - of right because there's only a few
31:10 - lines in this page of code that actually
31:12 - have some programmer intent so the next
31:15 - release of dots tries to help with this
31:17 - we'll start with this authoring
31:19 - component at the top instead of us
31:21 - asking you to write it you can ask the
31:23 - compiler to write it but just adding
31:25 - this generates authoring component
31:26 - attributes here in the bottom with the
31:29 - struct let's remove that for a second
31:31 - and let's replace it with the entities
31:33 - dot for each statement I'll get to that
31:35 - in a second but if you compare this to
31:37 - what we started with that's already a
31:40 - substantial improvement in terms of the
31:42 - amount of boilerplate that you need to
31:43 - deal with now let's take a look at this
31:46 - new code the programmers in the room
31:48 - they might have had a little heart
31:50 - attack because there's a lump expression
31:52 - in here those cost G's see allocations
31:56 - and those cost GC spikes and those
31:59 - caused complaining customers in the next
32:03 - dots release we're making the lambda
32:05 - expression in the entity step for each
32:07 - we're making it special instead of
32:09 - running it as normal she sharp we
32:11 - converted into that same job structs
32:13 - that we were asking you to write
32:14 - manually before so when you use this
32:17 - construct you
32:18 - the unity job system to go wide over all
32:21 - your course
32:22 - however it also uses burst if you look
32:26 - at the burst inspector for this code you
32:28 - can see that the inner loop uses these
32:30 - XML 1 XML 2 registers these are simply
32:33 - instructions that operate on multiple
32:35 - elements at the same time so not only
32:38 - are you going wide over all your course
32:40 - on each of those course you're going
32:42 - wide using all the sim delaine's and
32:45 - that's a great place for us to be and
32:47 - when you can have the most optimal code
32:49 - you could write but where you can write
32:52 - it in a relatively humane way that
32:54 - doesn't come at the expense of that
32:56 - performance another great convenient
33:01 - thing for programmers in dots is that
33:04 - when we ship dots we ship it to you as
33:06 - c-sharp source packages if you've played
33:10 - around with dots that means that the
33:12 - complete source code of dots and all the
33:14 - features that are built on top of it are
33:15 - on your left up in your backpack under
33:18 - your chair right now if you make a dots
33:21 - game and you grab a debugger and you
33:23 - start single stepping through your game
33:25 - code you'll step through your game code
33:27 - into our adults code into the physics
33:31 - code into the net code into the
33:33 - animation engine you can see everything
33:36 - you can change everything you can make
33:38 - fun of my incredibly verbose local
33:40 - variable names many people do that I
33:45 - won't give up though because in dots
33:50 - there's no more black boxes you can see
33:53 - everything alright enough with these
33:57 - programmers let's get you off him and
33:59 - Martin on stage
34:08 - Thank You Lucas now Lucas talked about
34:13 - how to write code for dots but you also
34:16 - need a great tool to create your content
34:18 - and for dots we're going to use the
34:22 - exact same unity editor you know and
34:25 - love already so Martin let's take a look
34:28 - at some content yeah so let's jump into
34:31 - a prototyping level here it's built
34:34 - exactly like you would expect in unity
34:36 - it's made out of prefabs nested prefabs
34:39 - game objects and components if we look
34:41 - at this sphere we'll see it's as you
34:43 - know it it has a mesh filter render a
34:45 - sphere Collider the only difference is
34:47 - that we have runtime converting this
34:49 - game object data into entity
34:51 - representation and in dots we make a
34:55 - distinction between the data that the
34:58 - game code operates on and the data that
35:02 - content creators use and bridging those
35:04 - two worlds is a conversion workflow it
35:08 - converts from a authoring friendly game
35:10 - object representation to runtime
35:13 - optimized entities and this optimized
35:17 - dots data is streamable it's compact and
35:20 - it's optimal for performance and in the
35:24 - preview inspector you can see that
35:27 - conversion in happening life
35:29 - so when Martin changes the physics buddy
35:33 - to be dynamic you can see the inspector
35:37 - update here and you can see exactly what
35:40 - these runtime game code components that
35:42 - are actually being used at runtime are
35:44 - being generated from your very simple to
35:47 - easy on easy to use understand authoring
35:49 - representation up there
35:52 - now to build a game you need at least a
35:58 - couple of core features so we built a
36:01 - third-person shooter and it uses all the
36:05 - brand new dots features animation
36:08 - physics rendering and netcode together
36:12 - and we made a very small simple sample
36:16 - project with the purpose of being easy
36:18 - to understand and digest so Lucas let's
36:22 - have a play alright let's go alright
36:29 - where are you
36:31 - everyone should know that Joe made me
36:33 - promise to lose good takeaway so what
36:47 - you see here this is running on our FPS
36:51 - net code it is built on top of dots and
36:54 - it makes it easy to create any network
36:57 - game using an FPS net code architecture
37:00 - it has everything that you would expect
37:02 - client-side prediction lack compensation
37:05 - and interpolation are all built-in we're
37:09 - also using the new unity animation
37:12 - package it is high performance very
37:17 - flexible and there are no black boxes
37:20 - every character in this game uses
37:23 - runtime I K as you can see here the feet
37:26 - are perfectly sticking to the to the
37:28 - chrome ball we use unity physics for the
37:31 - character controller sliding along the
37:33 - walls jumping and going over the floor
37:36 - we're using Ray casts from Unity physics
37:39 - for the shooting and for rendering we're
37:43 - using the script over in the pipelines
37:45 - with a dots based rendering component
37:48 - for optimal performance so Martin the
37:52 - only thing I'm just not too sure about
37:55 - in this is the color scheme you picked
37:57 - yeah the baby blue might be an issue and
38:00 - we can try and find something a bit
38:01 - cooler
38:03 - that's why there's a grat grass like
38:05 - more green buy that I save and boom
38:10 - there you have it on your device
38:12 - I can also try something else maybe that
38:15 - didn't work out that beautifully but
38:17 - like a midnight purple do that alright
38:21 - push it alright so that's a big deal
38:25 - because Martin has
38:33 - all the color wasn't that nice it's a
38:39 - big deal because Martin has this project
38:41 - opening the editor but me and you
38:43 - welcome we are running built players
38:45 - that are running the game and he's
38:47 - making a change in the editor on the
38:48 - left but it's affecting the players
38:51 - while they're running the game that
38:53 - don't have to reboot yeah
38:55 - so since I'm generating runtime ready
38:57 - data on the editor and there's no reason
38:59 - that I can't push it to any device so
39:02 - what kind of changes can you make
39:04 - anything really if you look at the the
39:07 - chrome sphere Joe then I can you know
39:08 - make translations I can duplicate and
39:13 - you know make another sphere and go back
39:17 - to geo the static component that I
39:20 - touched on the physics party make it
39:22 - dynamic they'll fall down collide maybe
39:25 - topple over if we were lucky there we go
39:29 - so yeah and then I didn't even make
39:32 - changes to shaders let's go into my
39:35 - shader graph we're like any good TV chef
39:37 - I prepared a little effect that we can
39:40 - drop on save
39:49 - so that's what I really love about this
39:51 - feature that
39:58 - it's what I really love I was running
40:01 - out the tablet
40:02 - you're welcome what's running on a
40:03 - desktop we could also attach a console
40:06 - in a phone and they would all attached
40:08 - to the same editing session and when
40:10 - Martin makes a change those bags out the
40:13 - the entity data for each of those
40:15 - devices individually so that means that
40:18 - he can see the changes on all of those
40:20 - devices without the devices having to
40:23 - restart or the games having to reboot
40:25 - and there's no matter the device it
40:27 - could be a console or iPhone or anything
40:29 - really so what does that do to your
40:31 - workflow as an artist yeah as an
40:33 - environment artists this means I can
40:34 - build my entire world on the device with
40:37 - direct feedback on actual device
40:38 - performance
40:39 - it'll be immediately visible to me if I
40:41 - have performance head room in one space
40:43 - of the level and I can add more detail
40:44 - there or if I need to optimize in
40:46 - another part of the level and instead of
40:48 - looking through complex profiling tools
40:50 - I can simply hide or delete elements and
40:52 - see the performance impact on the scene
40:56 - so in I believe this will have an
41:00 - incredible impact on your productivity
41:03 - unfortunately all of these features
41:06 - unity animation FPS netcode live link
41:11 - and conversion flow will ship as preview
41:14 - packages alongside unity 2000 19.3
41:26 - and we're also going to make the full
41:29 - project folder that we just showed you
41:30 - with all source code and assets
41:32 - available very soon right thank you
41:37 - thank you
41:45 - please welcome Brandi house
41:54 - from unkilled to Shadowgun legends
41:57 - madfinger has consistently pushed the
42:00 - boundaries of what's possible with
42:02 - mobile multiplayer gameplay one of the
42:05 - hardest problems developers face today
42:07 - we know that for unity to build the best
42:10 - multiplayer tools we need a battle test
42:12 - our tech and some of the most
42:14 - challenging scenarios out there
42:16 - enter mad fingers shadow gun more games
42:19 - a tournament style mobile title designed
42:23 - for eSports coming out later this year
42:28 - when you say you're the best shooters
42:31 - why do you say you're the best shooters
42:33 - because it's true general allegiance is
42:39 - social shooter so you can get in into
42:43 - the hop you can make friends you can
42:45 - play emotes you can set a match and you
42:48 - can go fight against audience the other
42:51 - side war games is very quick there is
42:54 - almost no social staff of course there
42:57 - goes support friends support girls but
43:00 - the game is designed to be super quick
43:03 - to jump in shoot making games challenge
43:06 - this is why I'm doing it this is what I
43:08 - love from very beginning from the first
43:10 - idea or for the final product everything
43:14 - it's challenging the challenges start
43:16 - with building but they go on forever
43:19 - once it's a living game whoops
43:21 - unity provides us is dedicated server
43:24 - which allows you to control what player
43:27 - can do and cannot you don't need to rely
43:31 - on clients and of course the biggest
43:35 - challenge is dealing with cheaters you
43:37 - know they're ruining the game to others
43:38 - No
43:39 - so we have to fight them using dedicated
43:42 - servers one big advantage you can run
43:47 - full simulation of the game on the
43:48 - servers which means you have a low
43:52 - latency you have full control and when
43:55 - gone in the game and they just won't be
43:58 - able to do those nasty stuff I must say
44:01 - that using unity matchmaker is more
44:04 - simple because it
44:06 - plugable and it provides all
44:08 - infrastructure and allows me to focus
44:10 - only on the matchmaker logic itself we
44:14 - got very close relationship with the
44:16 - unity and because unity cars so we can
44:21 - do games the best games ever
44:31 - to create games of this caliber you need
44:35 - to ensure your games don't lag prevent
44:37 - shooters from ruining your game quickly
44:40 - bring players together into fair matches
44:42 - and open communication channels that
44:44 - feel safe for everyone
44:46 - unity worked alongside madfinger to
44:49 - bring all of this into wargames
44:51 - madfinger started with our new unity
44:54 - transport package which enables rapid
44:57 - transfer of data to and from the game
44:59 - server keeping players in sync with as
45:01 - low latency as possible next they
45:05 - integrated our dedicated server hosting
45:06 - and matchmaking to seamlessly connect
45:09 - players to servers across the globe with
45:12 - our matchmaker madfinger defined which
45:14 - players they wanted to group together
45:16 - with custom c-sharp match functions and
45:19 - we handled the rest and finally they
45:23 - plugged into our best-in-class voice
45:25 - communications to provide their players
45:27 - with an immersive social experience as
45:31 - madfinger has shown you unity transport
45:34 - package available in preview dedicated
45:37 - server hosting matchmaking in beta next
45:40 - month and voice communications provide
45:43 - the foundation to build a world-class
45:45 - multiplayer experience thank you
45:49 - [Applause]

46:38 - [Music]
46:48 - please welcome
46:49 - Timoney West and Brittany Edmunds
46:56 - [Applause]
47:00 - if you want to make powerful deeply
47:03 - interactive augmented reality
47:04 - experiences that intelligently interact
47:07 - with the real world you are in the right
47:09 - place because you need the right tools
47:12 - to build intelligent AR experiences and
47:14 - we're building them for you we've built
47:17 - features that not only unlock the next
47:19 - generation of AR experiences but that
47:22 - help me creating these experiences much
47:25 - easier that's right yeah Mars is our
47:27 - suite of design and simulation tools
47:29 - that is built to make the workflow that
47:31 - much faster it allows you to prototype
47:34 - test and ship much more quickly than
47:37 - ever it sits on top of our AR foundation
47:40 - framework and it allows you to create a
47:42 - our experiences that work the way we
47:44 - really want AR to work context-aware
47:47 - flexible customizable work in any
47:50 - location and with any kind of data
47:52 - without requiring tons of code ok so
47:56 - let's talk about some of the ways that
47:58 - Mars makes your life easier ok so you
48:04 - can be constantly testing without having
48:07 - to make a device build and this is
48:09 - enabled through the Mars always-on query
48:11 - system which is very cool our simulation
48:14 - view and our environment templates and
48:17 - you can auto oriented applications using
48:22 - what you see is what you get interface
48:23 - you can literally drag and drop objects
48:26 - into the simulation view just like in
48:28 - real life and we have visual gizmos to
48:31 - help you actually layout objects in the
48:33 - space and just lay out your scene and
48:36 - you can use any kind of AR data and
48:39 - there is a lot so object tracking
48:42 - gesture detection body tracking face
48:46 - tracking all of these different types of
48:47 - data and we are future-proofing as well
48:50 - to make sure that we can take advantage
48:51 - of all the new cool types of data that
48:54 - are coming down the pipe and to make the
48:56 - development process even faster and more
48:58 - accurate Mars will have companion apps
49:01 - for AR devices the first iteration will
49:04 - be from mobile phones we're giving you a
49:06 - quick sneak peek right here you'll be
49:08 - able to sync projects in the unity cloud
49:10 - and then layout assets as easily as
49:12 - placing a 3ds
49:14 - you'll be able to use your phone to
49:16 - create conditions and record video and
49:18 - world data and export it straight back
49:20 - into the editor without having to make a
49:23 - build of your project I tell you that
49:26 - video part was really hard to get right
49:28 - okay and the next iteration of course is
49:31 - going to be for wearable AR devices the
49:34 - magic leap on the hololens and it's the
49:35 - same idea in mind you're sitting in your
49:38 - space you're taking in world data you
49:40 - have it on the headset and you can
49:42 - export it directly back into the editor
49:44 - to author against just same concept okay
49:49 - so there you go we've got Mars and that
49:51 - is our work environment for AR
49:53 - development but of course we want you to
49:55 - be able to take your AR experiences and
49:57 - get them into as many hands as possible
49:59 - and we have you covered there too Dan
50:03 - welcome to the stage thanks Tony
50:10 - a our foundation allows you to build
50:12 - your experience once and ship it on all
50:14 - major platforms in phase a our ecosystem
50:17 - each platform has similar core features
50:20 - but they each have different workflows
50:21 - and nuances to enable them we do the
50:24 - work to unify these so that you can
50:26 - simply enable the feature once in unity
50:29 - using a our foundation and that feature
50:31 - seamlessly works across all of the
50:33 - platforms if a feature is enabled on one
50:35 - platform but isn't available on another
50:37 - we put in the hooks so when the feature
50:39 - becomes available it's easy to put it
50:41 - into an existing app or experience
50:42 - simply by updating your packages not
50:45 - rebuilding your app from scratch this
50:47 - framework also gives you the ability to
50:49 - take advantage of all of the awesome
50:51 - features and workflows were building for
50:53 - unity so that you can create truly
50:55 - robust AR apps that are ready to ship to
50:58 - internal stakeholders or on any app
51:00 - stores and we're not just talking about
51:03 - mobile anymore that's because AR
51:05 - foundation now extends to wearable AR
51:08 - devices for the first time ever you can
51:11 - build an experience once and ship it on
51:13 - AR kit AR core hololens and magiclip
51:16 - devices and we you're building an
51:19 - experience to any or all of these
51:21 - devices we know that you're going to
51:23 - want your user to actually be able to
51:24 - interact with that content in a variety
51:26 - of ways like scaling rotating
51:29 - repositioning it just to name a few we
51:31 - also know that coding these object
51:34 - interactions from scratch for each
51:36 - device and every new platform is really
51:39 - time consuming so we're giving you the
51:41 - ability to add interactivity to your AR
51:44 - and VR applications simply by adding
51:46 - components to your objects this brand
51:49 - new XR interaction toolkit handles
51:51 - everything from touches and gestures on
51:53 - mobile devices all the way up to tracked
51:55 - controllers and even tracked hands this
51:58 - toolkit is coming out in preview in 2019
52:01 - point 3 and now we want to leave you
52:04 - with one final note having to completely
52:08 - rebuild your app from scratch in order
52:11 - to add AR functionality to it is time
52:13 - consuming and painful and we know that
52:16 - it's actually a non-starter for some of
52:18 - you so we're officially giving you the
52:21 - ability to embed the full power
52:24 - unity inclusive of our AR offerings
52:26 - directly into any native app that
52:29 - already exists today and with that
52:32 - capability combined with Mars AR
52:36 - foundation and the X our interaction
52:38 - toolkit we're giving you the tools to
52:40 - build powerful augmented reality
52:41 - experiences that intelligently interact
52:44 - with the real world and reach the widest
52:46 - possible audience thank you please
53:00 - welcome Adam Chernykh
53:11 - hi everyone at chop Architects were
53:14 - focused on innovation we've done
53:17 - projects such as the uber headquarters
53:19 - in San Francisco and US embassies around
53:21 - the world one of our most recent
53:23 - projects is a skyscraper it's currently
53:26 - under construction in New York City it's
53:28 - set to become the tallest structure in
53:30 - Brooklyn it's also the first project
53:33 - that's using unity reflect which is a
53:35 - new product from unity but before I jump
53:38 - into that let me give you a little bit
53:39 - of background see architects and
53:42 - engineers have been using 3d for a long
53:44 - time the technology is called building
53:47 - information modeling or simply BIM see
53:50 - now with unity reflect we can actually
53:52 - do a lot more with this BIM information
53:55 - with these BIM models until recently the
53:58 - time it took to get these BIM models
54:00 - into real time engines was far from
54:03 - real-time it actually took teams days or
54:07 - weeks in order to optimize and convert
54:09 - these models into real time ready assets
54:12 - and this really didn't align with the
54:14 - speed of iteration that we needed in our
54:16 - office and of course the consequence was
54:19 - that not a lot of our projects made it
54:21 - into real time engines but now with
54:24 - unity reflect it's easy for any
54:26 - architect or designer to take their BIM
54:28 - models and data into unity and this is a
54:31 - big deal this is a game-changer for our
54:34 - industry so let me show you a little bit
54:35 - about it so the first thing to note is
54:38 - that you get a couple things out of the
54:40 - box with unity reflect you get a plugin
54:43 - into our BIM software Autodesk Revit as
54:46 - well as a reflect viewer application so
54:50 - here we are in Autodesk Revit and we
54:53 - have our entire model for that tower
54:57 - project in Brooklyn and this is actually
54:59 - the model that we use to create
55:01 - construction documents to get this
55:03 - building built and I have another view
55:06 - here that just isolates the exterior
55:10 - window panels of this model and this is
55:13 - actually what we're gonna focus on in
55:14 - this demo is these exterior windows so
55:18 - first off what I'm going to do is I'm
55:19 - going to pull in all this geometry into
55:22 - the
55:23 - box viewer and this is the out of the
55:24 - box viewer we have over here on the
55:25 - right all I have to do is open up these
55:28 - projects and pull it in and you'll
55:30 - notice how fast it is to get this model
55:33 - into this out of the box reflect viewer
55:35 - and you can navigate and isolate
55:38 - specific components and another very
55:42 - very important thing to note is the live
55:44 - link function so if I click this button
55:46 - right here we're actually creating a
55:49 - live link between our BIM software and
55:51 - the reflect viewer so if we come down to
55:55 - this awning here and that looks a little
55:58 - bit small so let's make it a little bit
56:00 - bigger we're gonna be able to see this
56:02 - updated live in the viewer and this is
56:05 - huge if we're making changes with
56:07 - clients or general contractors we're
56:09 - gonna be able to get these updates in AR
56:11 - or in VR in real time this is very
56:14 - important and this is what you get out
56:16 - of the box with reflect but since it's
56:19 - built on unity we're able to customize
56:21 - and build on top of this technology and
56:24 - so that's actually what we're most
56:25 - excited about here at shelf architects
56:28 - so I'm going to show you the first thing
56:30 - that we built with unity reflect which
56:31 - is a panel status tracking application
56:35 - for the exterior windows of this tower
56:38 - so if we jump back into Revit really
56:40 - quick here I want to show you one thing
56:42 - if I toggle through and grab one of
56:44 - these panels we'll see all of the
56:46 - associated metadata over here in the
56:49 - left side and we'll see this one
56:51 - specific piece of metadata here panel
56:53 - status and this piece of data is what
56:55 - we're going to be looking for over in
56:57 - the unity editor so if we jump into
57:00 - unity now I'm gonna show you how easy it
57:02 - is to set up a reflect project I have
57:05 - the reflect package here I'm just gonna
57:07 - drag and drop in the reflect prefab and
57:09 - hit play and what you're gonna notice is
57:12 - that right out of the gates what we get
57:15 - is the exact same functionality as the
57:17 - reflect viewer that you had just seen
57:20 - but now that we're since we're in unity
57:23 - we can actually look and dive in a
57:25 - little bit and customize so I'm going to
57:27 - jump into this root game object and I'm
57:29 - going to show you that this is actually
57:31 - where this model instantiate it itself
57:33 - and we're gonna see over on the Left
57:35 - when I select a panel here
57:37 - all of that metadata that we had in our
57:39 - BIM software is now accessible in unity
57:42 - this is huge including this panel status
57:45 - parameter which is what our custom
57:48 - script is going to be looking for so if
57:50 - I kill this really quick and I look at
57:52 - our main camera I have a custom script
57:55 - here that I'm just going to turn on and
57:57 - I'm gonna give it a couple inputs so I'm
58:00 - gonna give it this manager and I'm gonna
58:03 - give it this root game object and I'm
58:05 - gonna rerun it so what we're able to do
58:08 - here is we're actually able to grab that
58:10 - piece of data and then we're gonna
58:11 - change the material of each of these
58:14 - panels based on that panel status piece
58:18 - of data so it's going to come in here
58:20 - and then it's going to change the colors
58:22 - of these panels and these panels these
58:24 - colors of these panels are indicative to
58:26 - the status of that panel on the
58:29 - construction site whether that panel is
58:31 - complete whether that panel is in
58:34 - transit on its way to the construction
58:36 - site or maybe there's an issue
58:38 - associated with that panel there's a
58:39 - crack and it needs to be replaced and
58:43 - all we have to do now is switch the
58:45 - build target out to iOS and build out a
58:47 - mobile a RF and I actually have the
58:50 - finished app here on my iPad and I'll
58:52 - show you guys the AR they are finished
58:55 - at so this is an AR foundation app so
58:58 - it's a multi platform so all I have to
59:00 - do here is scan the floor and drop our
59:03 - model and you're gonna see here that we
59:05 - have the tower with V with all of these
59:10 - panels here and since now it's
59:12 - interactive in an AR app I can select a
59:14 - panel and in the top left you're going
59:16 - to see the panel status of that is in
59:18 - progress we're getting that bim data
59:20 - information back into an augmented
59:23 - reality application and this is really
59:25 - really important but this is still just
59:29 - the first step this is still really just
59:32 - the first step
59:33 - reviewing designs in the office is great
59:36 - but what we're most excited about is to
59:38 - get this technology on to the
59:41 - construction site so that we can help
59:43 - transform our industry by better
59:45 - connecting design and construction see
59:48 - we actually took one of our first
59:49 - reflect applications
59:50 - on site to the construction site of this
59:53 - tower in Brooklyn and began you'll see
59:55 - that our construction team is overlaying
59:57 - these BIM models in data in real time on
60:01 - top of this construction site and this
60:03 - is very very valuable this is going to
60:06 - help us catch design flaws fast solve
60:09 - problems faster and inevitably decrease
60:13 - the time it takes to build ultimately
60:16 - what this means is designing and
60:18 - building in more efficient and
60:20 - sustainable ways thank you
60:23 - [Applause]
60:32 - please welcome danny lang
60:37 - [Applause]
60:41 - thank you thank you good evening as
60:44 - creators you're faced with many
60:48 - questions around the quality safety and
60:51 - stability of your products in an ideal
60:55 - world you would want to explore all
60:58 - questions and all possibilities but
61:01 - unfortunately you're bound by time
61:06 - inadequate information and limited
61:09 - resources of the physical world we live
61:12 - in but fortunately we have unity a
61:18 - virtual world that is spatial where you
61:24 - have physics and visual fidelity and all
61:29 - the interactions you need to simulate
61:33 - any experience however the scope of your
61:39 - simulations is currently limited to the
61:42 - hardware at hand that is until today
61:47 - introducing unity simulation our new
61:52 - cloud-based simulation product backed by
61:59 - Google cloud unity simulation enables
62:02 - you to automatically run multiple
62:05 - instances of your unity projects at an
62:09 - incredible scale and on a variety of
62:12 - hardware you can now test your products
62:17 - at any point in the development process
62:19 - you can train your systems on millions
62:23 - or even billions of scenarios and edge
62:26 - cases and you can validate your concepts
62:30 - without any upfront hardware investments
62:37 - unity simulation is already breaking
62:40 - barriers across industries take for
62:44 - example a self-driving car it needs to
62:48 - drive at least 11 billion miles before
62:51 - it is considered safe
62:55 - with a traditional training method you'd
62:59 - maybe get to this goal in a hundred
63:01 - years and each time an update is made to
63:06 - a piece of hardware or software in the
63:09 - car systems the whole thing needs to be
63:13 - revalidated across a suite of test cases
63:18 - but with unity simulation you can drive
63:21 - sooner by running millions of test
63:24 - scenarios parallel in the cloud for
63:29 - example the LG as we held simulator is
63:35 - LG Electronics autonomous vehicle
63:38 - simulator it takes advantage of several
63:43 - advanced unity features such as the
63:46 - high-definition rendering pipeline the
63:48 - job systems and the best compiler does
63:53 - that to simulate photorealistic digital
63:57 - trend of real-world environments with
64:00 - accurate vehicle and sensor models
64:04 - developers can now build and test their
64:07 - autonomous vehicles by running a diverse
64:10 - set of scenarios running these
64:13 - simulations on the desktop would take
64:16 - months at least
64:18 - but with LG svl simulator running on
64:23 - unity simulation you can train more
64:25 - quickly safely and likely save some
64:28 - money too while simulation can help
64:34 - invent the future it's also crucial to
64:39 - solving everyday tasks that are
64:43 - important yet labor-intensive and
64:47 - tedious such as fine-tuning for game
64:54 - balance before soft launching again we
64:58 - have been working with a logical a 37
65:02 - person game studio based in Canada on
65:05 - the upcoming title row
65:07 - raises illogical wanted to up level the
65:12 - player experience an engagement through
65:15 - game balancing they had to address some
65:20 - questions that were tough to answer
65:24 - especially when you have tight deadlines
65:27 - and you know that our skilled players
65:30 - beating on skilled players by a big
65:34 - margin are their combinations of cards
65:37 - or power-ups that would lead to big
65:40 - advantages for player in the first case
65:45 - of a skilled player beating an unskilled
65:48 - by a big margin illogical wanted to test
65:52 - many different game settings to find the
65:55 - one that would even out the playing
65:57 - field and keep the game fund for all
66:02 - using unity simulation illogic had
66:05 - decided to do a grid search and
66:08 - basically explore all combinations of
66:12 - possible values for three parameters in
66:15 - the game to find the one combination
66:20 - that would optimized for best results in
66:25 - logic I ran over 22,000 simulations in a
66:30 - matter of hours instead of the weeks it
66:33 - would have taken with human players
66:35 - doing this okay with unity simulation
66:39 - illogic was able to quickly understand
66:42 - which settings would lead to an enhanced
66:46 - player experience scale is no longer a
66:50 - barrier with unity simulation but we're
66:54 - not finished doing simulations at scale
66:57 - is critical to achieving big goals but
67:01 - what if you're a smaller game studio who
67:04 - just needs a simple fast way for you to
67:08 - optimize your game for your individual
67:10 - players
67:11 - well future play is here to tell you
67:14 - more thank you
67:16 - [Applause]
67:23 - please welcome tatu Lane
67:28 - [Applause]
67:33 - future play games is a small studio of
67:35 - 34 people based in Helsinki our most
67:38 - notable games are idle farming Empire
67:41 - and balance Royale which together have
67:43 - over 65 million downloads as a game
67:47 - designer my job is to keep players in
67:49 - the game idle farming mbar is over four
67:54 - years old and we're constantly looking
67:55 - for ways to improve our metrics and keep
67:59 - things fresh I need to provide a
68:03 - constant flow of new content features
68:05 - and events I have so many ideas I want
68:09 - to test but every test requires an
68:12 - analyst a programmer an artist it can
68:16 - take weeks to design and even longer to
68:19 - roll out and analyze the results and as
68:23 - a small studio that's just not feasible
68:25 - for example our store hadn't been
68:28 - updated in over three years so last
68:31 - month we decided to make a better
68:33 - version of our store we thought it would
68:36 - be a small thing but it turned out we
68:39 - were wrong players hated the new store
68:42 - we had to drop everything we were doing
68:44 - to roll it back
68:46 - it took us way too long to correct our
68:49 - mistake and roll out a fix we needed
68:52 - something to help us iterate faster to
68:57 - make smarter decisions that don't come
68:59 - at the cost of losing players so when we
69:03 - learned about game tune a decision
69:05 - engine powered by machine learning
69:08 - optimizes your game in real time we were
69:11 - all in I was excited that there was
69:14 - something that acted and learned fact
69:18 - faster than us one of the tests we ran
69:22 - was for tutorial progression speed and
69:26 - we set the game to to optimize for de7
69:30 - retention we then gave it four different
69:33 - speeds to choose from from very slow to
69:36 - very fast and we assumed that there was
69:40 - no way the slowest speed could win but
69:43 - we assumed wrong again
69:45 - game tune was able to immediately
69:48 - identify the slowest speed as the best
69:51 - variable and we started seeing positive
69:54 - results in just a few days and we didn't
69:58 - even need to analyze the results because
70:00 - the game was adjusted in real time we
70:05 - would have never tested these extreme
70:07 - settings without game tune because the
70:10 - risk of losing players was too high with
70:14 - game tune we could be more bold and as a
70:17 - result we were able to inject new life
70:21 - into the game and we now retain 5% more
70:24 - players every day and run double the
70:28 - tests we used to the time we save on
70:32 - testing now gets foot toward developing
70:35 - and optimizing features thanks to game
70:39 - tune we now have the power of a large
70:41 - machine learning team they live to
70:44 - deliver the best experience to our
70:47 - players thank you

72:39 - that's our driving force when it comes
72:42 - to graphics you need power to push your
72:44 - visuals and control to be able to decide
72:47 - what matters to you most we are
72:51 - investing in our render technology with
72:53 - the scriptable render pipelines giving
72:56 - you direct control over what you need
72:58 - you could take advantage or to render
73:00 - pipelines out of the box use them as a
73:03 - starting point for your own solution or
73:05 - customize them to meet your needs the
73:08 - High Definition render pipeline is best
73:10 - to use if your goal is more targeted
73:12 - pushing graphics as far as you can and
73:14 - high-end hardware delivering powerful
73:16 - performance high fidelity visuals it's a
73:19 - fully featured offering in twenty
73:20 - nineteen point three now out of preview
73:23 - bringing stunning graphics and photo
73:25 - realism at game ready set frame rates
73:27 - your HD RP assets will scale and
73:30 - fidelity on high-end platforms taking
73:32 - the best advantage of the available
73:33 - hardware resources for best visual
73:35 - quality and you only have to author at
73:37 - once with our full suite of production
73:39 - ready artist tools such as VFX graph
73:42 - shader graph post-processing the second
73:45 - pipeline is Universal render pipeline
73:47 - formerly known as lightweight render
73:49 - pipeline which is best to use if you
73:51 - want full unity platform reach with
73:53 - best-in-class visual quality and
73:55 - performance it's a powerful solution
73:57 - right out of the box with a full suite
73:59 - of artist tools for content creation
74:00 - most importantly it visually scales the
74:03 - capabilities of the hardware to all
74:05 - platforms at Unity targets we believe
74:08 - it's important that you have the right
74:09 - tool for the right job
74:10 - you now have a range of options you can
74:12 - constantly build off of right now and
74:14 - for the future and if 2d is where you
74:17 - live our new suite of tools will unlock
74:19 - even more creativity let's take a look
74:25 - [Applause]
74:31 - [Music]
74:56 - [Music]
75:02 - [Music]
75:10 - [Music]
75:36 - please welcome Andy touch and Jennifer
75:39 - Nord wall
75:47 - we love 2d
75:49 - whether it's an RPG or a match 3 game
75:52 - some of today's most successful games
75:54 - are 2d including 75 of the top 100
75:59 - mobile games and we've been working to
76:03 - raise the bar for development across the
76:04 - board to not only help you create what
76:07 - you want but also improve the experience
76:09 - of how you create it so let's take a
76:12 - look at the 2d tools working together
76:14 - but Before we jump in I want to give a
76:17 - very big thank you to back to the game
76:19 - studio based in Montreal who made the
76:21 - lovely project that Jennifer and I are
76:24 - about to show you this project is called
76:31 - The Lost crypt it was created using the
76:34 - universal render pipeline which now has
76:38 - a built in 2d renderer really dedicated
76:41 - to making art truly shine
77:03 - the 2d renderer introduces a wealth of
77:06 - new graphics features that you can see
77:07 - throughout these environments from the
77:10 - glowing particles that were in the air
77:12 - so the characters dynamic shadow being
77:14 - caused by the magic wand onto the Crypt
77:17 - wall and the rich town of the forest and
77:21 - these little spirit sprites is a result
77:24 - of our new native 2d lighting system
77:27 - that mood variety and depth to create
77:30 - this mystical nighttime atmosphere so
77:33 - let's go behind the scenes to see how
77:35 - the new 2d tools helped bring this
77:37 - project to life so previously to create
77:42 - a day/night cycle you'd make many
77:44 - different versions of every sprites in
77:46 - the level but 2d lights make this much
77:49 - much easier all sprites can be reused in
77:52 - every lighting condition and as you can
77:55 - see as jennifer moves this slider it
77:57 - controls a wide variety of lights that
77:59 - dynamically modify everything that you
78:01 - see in the scene and here we have what
78:06 - we call a 2d point lights this has a
78:09 - wide range of insane gizmos to visually
78:12 - control how it illuminates the scene you
78:16 - may notice that the lights intensity and
78:19 - also the fall-off are also influenced in
78:21 - the normal maps on the background star
78:23 - map wall
78:29 - and this scene looks great but a layer
78:32 - of visual polish can be added to take it
78:34 - to that next level shader graph and
78:37 - post-processing work together with the
78:39 - 2d renderer and the visual effects of
78:42 - this water sprites were composed
78:44 - entirely using shader graph and as we
78:47 - can see the water refracts the dungeon
78:50 - floor and also reflects the 2d lights
78:56 - shader graph allows you to create 2d
78:58 - shaders with absolutely no code by
79:01 - connecting these very visual nodes
79:04 - together so let's take a look at the
79:08 - organic let's look a look at the
79:10 - creation of organic terrains in the past
79:14 - a team will need to create manage and
79:16 - also layout many individual little
79:18 - sprites and colliders entirely
79:20 - separately but with sprite shape you
79:24 - define all your data in just one place
79:25 - and a visual tool makes it easy to
79:28 - create and also iterate on your level
79:31 - shape and these sprite shapes they can
79:35 - also be used to generate platform
79:37 - colliders and also dynamically changed
79:39 - the environment visuals that you see on
79:42 - the screen now when it comes to
79:47 - animating characters sometimes frame by
79:50 - frame animation can be very costly in
79:52 - terms of production time file size and
79:55 - just being difficult to iterate on with
79:58 - a new bone based solution a team needs
80:01 - less arts to achieve smooth animation so
80:05 - here we have this character and she's
80:06 - been created using our new rigging and I
80:08 - K system made entirely for 2d and the
80:11 - characters hurt uses that exact same
80:14 - rigging system but instead driven by 2d
80:17 - physics and here you can see that
80:21 - Jennifer is switching the sprite library
80:23 - asset and this is instantly in real time
80:26 - changing how the character looks
80:30 - all whilst reusing the same 2d rig CDI K
80:34 - and 2d animations this opens up a world
80:37 - of possibilities for developing your
80:39 - game as you can see these new tools and
80:46 - workflows will help you to achieve what
80:47 - you want to create in the most efficient
80:50 - way thank you
80:59 - please welcome Tim Cooper
81:09 - the universal render pipeline is a
81:11 - powerful rendering technology that
81:14 - delivers a combination of beauty and
81:16 - performance right out of the box best of
81:19 - all is supported on any platform that
81:21 - unity can target whether you're building
81:23 - for 2d 3d VR or AR if you wish to
81:28 - develop once and deploy everywhere this
81:31 - is the rendering technology you should
81:33 - be using by using the universal render
81:36 - pipeline you are able to target all of
81:38 - able to use all of our new artist tools
81:41 - and workflows including VFX graph shader
81:44 - graph post-processing light mapping
81:47 - tools and render passes you can update
81:50 - your projects from unities built-in
81:52 - renderer and simply put it runs better
81:54 - and scales better to demonstrate the
81:57 - benefits of moving to the universal
81:59 - render pipeline we decided to upgrade a
82:01 - real project we took the polygon farm
82:04 - asset store pack by Cynthia Studios and
82:07 - ran it through our automated upgrade
82:09 - tooling in every aspect the universal
82:12 - render pipeline performed better and
82:14 - faster Universal render pipeline
82:17 - utilizes an improved single pass Ford
82:20 - rendering technique that leads to
82:21 - fantastic performance improvements CPU
82:25 - and GPU usage with 30% faster draw calls
82:29 - were significantly reduced and memory
82:32 - access was improved by one third meaning
82:34 - that you can add more content and still
82:36 - hit your target frame rates put simply
82:39 - Universal render pipeline can handle
82:41 - more content it won't heat up your phone
82:43 - as much and your users can play longer
82:45 - now to help me talk about beauty and
82:49 - extensibility andre McGrail will join me
82:59 - so this is crest ocean a tool developed
83:03 - by a small team of true from the UK
83:06 - crest allows you to create beautiful
83:08 - realistic oceans and is built as a
83:10 - plugin for the Universal render pipeline
83:12 - it's available on the asset store now
83:15 - when you think about tropical islands
83:17 - what comes to mind to me it's beautiful
83:21 - inviting emerald green water this
83:24 - phenomenon is caused by the way that
83:26 - bright tropical light scatters and
83:28 - bounces as it interacts with the water
83:30 - is the difficult effect to model
83:32 - accurately utilizing the power of the
83:35 - universal render pipeline the team was
83:37 - able to extend the rendering without
83:39 - having to modify the universal source
83:41 - code and develop a number of
83:42 - state-of-the-art rendering features to
83:44 - model this beautiful water you can see
83:46 - on screen right now to start with the
83:49 - team used the custom render pass feature
83:51 - to add shadow accumulation inside the
83:53 - water volume you can see this here in
83:55 - the cave beautiful soft shadows another
84:01 - important part of the Universal render
84:03 - pipeline is the physically based shading
84:06 - model this scales from high-end to
84:08 - mobile devices this is an exposed shader
84:11 - library that you can use in your
84:12 - projects for custom materials in crest
84:15 - ocean this was used to help model the
84:17 - state-of-the-art subsurface light
84:19 - scattering within the water volume
84:20 - without this the aisle the island looks
84:23 - much less tropical and frankly to me a
84:26 - little dull previously to make effects
84:29 - like this they were hard to achieve but
84:31 - with explicit hooks it's now possible to
84:33 - greatly extend the rendering without
84:35 - having to write a renderer from scratch
84:37 - so Universal gives you beauty and
84:40 - extensibility but what about platform
84:43 - reach keeping with the theme of tropical
84:46 - islands let's take a look at the boat
84:48 - attack project with Universal render
84:51 - path line you can truly author once and
84:53 - deploy everywhere with great performance
84:56 - and best-in-class visuals so let's take
84:59 - a look at this running on the Xbox one
85:04 - we developed the boat attack in-house as
85:07 - a way to test features for universal as
85:09 - we were developing the pad plan do you
85:11 - want to switch across to the PlayStation
85:12 - 4 Andre
85:21 - we added some cool features to this like
85:23 - a day/night cycle and custom time of day
85:25 - how about you show the people in the
85:26 - crowd
85:32 - and finally let's take a look at this
85:34 - running on the Nintendo switch so what's
85:42 - great about this is this was all built
85:44 - from the same unity project Universal
85:46 - render power plan easily reaches the
85:48 - high end with fantastic performance high
85:50 - resolution and beautiful quality but a
85:53 - project like this how well does it run
85:55 - on mobile here you can see three phones
85:59 - each with different power and
86:01 - capabilities the project you see here is
86:04 - built from the exact same concept
86:05 - content as on the consoles except some
86:08 - features have been optimized through our
86:10 - scalable quality settings on these
86:12 - phones we hit a rock-solid 30 frames per
86:14 - second without sacrificing quality we've
86:18 - also upgraded the post-processing to a
86:20 - state-of-the-art mobile optimized
86:21 - version these effects are designed to
86:23 - work blazingly fast and take advantage
86:25 - of Hardware specific to mobile devices
86:27 - you can easily upgrade your existing
86:30 - projects using our upgrade tooling and
86:32 - start to take advantage of the new
86:34 - features and performance benefits in the
86:36 - 20 19.3 beta if you wish to have
86:39 - gorgeous graphics and be able to scale
86:40 - your content then you need to be using
86:42 - the production ready Universal render
86:44 - pipeline thank you
86:45 - [Applause]
86:52 - please welcome Freeman Ben
87:02 - since starting multiverse our 40-person
87:05 - studio in shenzhen china we've
87:08 - established a reputation for building
87:10 - immersive VR games but our newest
87:13 - project has us applying our unity
87:16 - expertise to PC today I'm thrilled to
87:20 - share an early view at our newest game
87:24 - earth from another Sun in this troika's
87:29 - PS a mysterious threat in the future
87:32 - since earth through a wormhole
87:34 - back to the present day we jumped into
87:37 - production
87:37 - earlier this year leveraging a few unity
87:40 - sample assets to move fast driven by the
87:44 - desire to realize our vision of a
87:46 - graphically stunning game with a new
87:49 - level of immersive realism which was the
87:52 - high-definition render pipeline HDR P
87:56 - enables us to build a world that feels
87:59 - more lifelike and organic creating an
88:02 - ambience that evokes a sense of tension
88:05 - and mystery to achieve this our artists
88:11 - layered a variety of HDR P effects first
88:16 - we adjusted the exposure then there's
88:21 - some tone mapping applied subsurface
88:25 - scattering add a volumetric lighting
88:30 - modify the color grading and made a
88:33 - slight lens distortion the result speaks
88:39 - for itself
88:40 - a stunning environment that's alive and
88:44 - far more immersive than what we started
88:46 - with even better we didn't have to
88:51 - sacrifice performance every shooter
88:55 - strives for a high frame rate but
88:58 - balancing visual fidelity and
89:00 - performance can be a challenge or
89:03 - overjoyed that earth from another Sun
89:06 - runs at a smooth 60 frames per second
89:12 - even during intense battles while
89:15 - defending against horse of enemies or
89:18 - going up against a giant alien warm
89:21 - performance never stutters or able to
89:26 - achieve our graphical vision while
89:29 - ensuring highly performant gameplay with
89:34 - the high-definition render pipeline
89:36 - we're benefiting from its incredible
89:39 - visual capabilities while future
89:41 - proofing our development as we head
89:44 - toward a release in 2020 thank you
89:55 - this is the place doesn't look like much
90:10 - go take a look
90:28 - yeah okay here we go
91:08 - so exactly is this guy good kidding
91:13 - there are fairy tales Boston don't be an
91:16 - idiot
91:38 - I see
91:41 - [Music]
91:59 - open it wait
92:14 - do it
92:58 - [Music]
93:12 - please ask the real this makes no sense
93:16 - to me basta but you might happen to be
93:19 - right
93:42 - [Music]
94:02 - you got one shot at this
94:09 - I've got one shot this
94:28 - I know
95:04 - [Music]
95:25 - here it is the last one we know that now
95:46 - that's why I'm here
96:55 - [Applause]
97:03 - please welcome Silvia Rasha Beth and
97:06 - Vlad makeup
97:14 - what you just saw renders in real time
97:18 - 30 frames per second on commercial grade
97:21 - hardware what we like to do now is to
97:25 - give you a behind-the-scenes peek into
97:27 - what this short film looks like in unity
97:30 - and to share how we address some of the
97:33 - more interesting production and artistic
97:36 - challenges in this project so what we
97:39 - have here is the whole short film from
97:41 - the beginning to the end running in
97:43 - unity in real time we'd like to focus on
97:45 - some of the more interesting points that
97:47 - one allowed us to communicate to you how
97:49 - the team managed to accomplish their
97:50 - vision with our productions we are
97:54 - always striving to achieve a two-fold
97:57 - goal on one side we want to push the
98:00 - boundaries on visual fidelity and to get
98:02 - closer to photo realism and on the other
98:05 - we want to enable artistic style ization
98:07 - and visual development that is
98:09 - influenced from cinema we wanted to
98:12 - focus on creating a compelling
98:14 - experience but without getting bogged
98:16 - down with a technically mundane so let
98:19 - us dive right in and first of all show
98:21 - you how unit is high definition render
98:23 - pipeline is used throughout the project
98:25 - it is a feature we've been talking a lot
98:27 - about and here is why it is important
98:29 - the great thing about the HD render
98:32 - pipeline is that it makes high-fidelity
98:34 - graphics very accessible you don't need
98:37 - to use any arbitrary measurements and
98:39 - values you can simply emulate what you
98:42 - observe in the real world and you can
98:44 - get the results you expect lighting a
98:46 - scene for example is very intuitive with
98:49 - a range of powerful features such as
98:51 - area lights which are great for shots
98:53 - like this and volumetric lights which
98:56 - contribute a lot to the ambient feel and
98:58 - as Sylvia mentioned because a GRP is
99:01 - using physically accurate values
99:02 - everything else from the camera lens to
99:04 - bloom it just works
99:07 - HDR P also comes built-in with a
99:09 - powerful set of post-processing tools
99:11 - which allow us to modify the final frame
99:14 - to receive this cinematic look that we
99:16 - desire here you can watch in this shot
99:18 - how it that drastically changes the
99:20 - final look
99:22 - let me emphasize this real quick we are
99:25 - talking about final quality frame which
99:28 - goes directly into the film and that is
99:31 - manipulating it in real time in the
99:33 - editor this is possible due to HDR piece
99:36 - fully unified physically based rendering
99:39 - HTP already comes with some very
99:42 - powerful shaders with which artists can
99:44 - author believable materials these
99:46 - include anything from the standard lead
99:48 - shader to fabric hair or decal shaders
99:51 - however in every project the need for
99:54 - something project specific may arise
99:56 - unity shader graph allows for easy
99:59 - authoring of custom shaders this
100:02 - empowers artists to work independently
100:04 - and to raise the quality of the visuals
100:06 - they create for example here the team is
100:09 - using shader graph to create a dust
100:11 - shader this shader is applied to a
100:13 - material which we've added here to this
100:15 - pipe as you can see wherever I move the
100:17 - pipe that does always settles on top now
100:19 - these kind of effects are really the
100:21 - bread and butter of any kind of
100:22 - production but shader graph enables
100:24 - anybody on the team to create them now
100:29 - on to the character Morgan which appears
100:31 - at the end of the protagonist journey it
100:34 - presented a challenge that we hadn't
100:36 - tackled before it is a creature of
100:38 - undefined shape and gender in a
100:40 - constantly fluctuating emotional state
100:43 - it is distressed and chaotic a being
100:46 - which is both good and evil both male
100:49 - and female both aggressive and
100:51 - vulnerable how do we achieve something
100:53 - like that so we needed a tool that
100:56 - enables us to explore its visual
100:58 - appearance and behavior through fast
101:00 - design iterations we needed not only to
101:03 - render this character in real time but
101:05 - also to author it through a real-time
101:07 - creation process individual effects
101:10 - graph was just the right tool to tackle
101:12 - the challenge of creating a character
101:14 - such as morgan by creating the
101:16 - simulation with GPU particles an artist
101:19 - can change the geometry and the
101:20 - character will basically conform to this
101:22 - new geometry the particles will go and
101:24 - change so this is really powerful
101:26 - because it enables not only to tackle
101:28 - the challenge of Morgan but also to
101:29 - iterate and try out new things and this
101:32 - is how we were able to see Morgan
101:34 - transition
101:35 - between genders transforming from a
101:37 - giant to human size all the while their
101:40 - appearance is shifting in line with
101:41 - their change in emotions one of the most
101:47 - complex problems not only real-time
101:49 - graphics but in CG in general is how to
101:52 - achieve believable human characters the
101:56 - human face is so familiar to us that we
101:58 - have evolved to read and recognize even
102:01 - the tiniest details of its expression in
102:04 - order for a digital human to look
102:06 - acceptable to us a large number of
102:08 - technological features need to be
102:10 - developed and to play nicely together
102:12 - all at once with the production of The
102:15 - Heretic we wanted to explore this space
102:17 - and we wanted to help accelerate unity
102:20 - on a path towards becoming a next level
102:22 - tool for creators no matter how high
102:25 - their ambitions in addition to all
102:27 - standard materials HTTP now ships with
102:30 - building master notes - hair fabric and
102:32 - other advanced materials here we are
102:35 - using the built-in hair shader for
102:37 - Gawain stubble and eyebrows and since we
102:40 - are on the topic of hair this is the
102:42 - hair geometry and you can see as Gawain
102:44 - is being animated the geometry conforms
102:47 - to the face and this was possible with
102:49 - the help of c-sharp jobs and the Birth
102:51 - compiler which allow us to resolve over
102:53 - 400,000 individual frames it is reposes
102:57 - every frame at runtime in addition even
103:00 - though there isn't a dedicated skin
103:01 - shader the team here is extending the
103:03 - stack Lit master noted in HDR P to
103:06 - create a believable skin shader which is
103:08 - applied to go in and you can see as we
103:10 - change the light that the shader reacts
103:12 - as you expect
103:15 - now H TRP and the VFX graph are coming
103:20 - out of preview
103:20 - they are production ready for content
103:23 - creation in unity 20 19.3 you can have
103:27 - it in your hands already today in open
103:29 - beta thank you thank you
103:31 - [Applause]
103:40 - that's our show I hope you guys had a
103:42 - good time learned a little bit found
103:45 - some interesting tidbits so we believe
103:48 - and hope you agree that real-time 3d is
103:52 - one of the most powerful storytelling
103:54 - mediums of our time and into the future
103:57 - so we hope you guys agree with that so
103:59 - we are going to call it a night for
104:02 - those on the livestream please stick
104:04 - around for the post show with Liz and
104:06 - will it'll start immediately after for
104:09 - all of you in the room here we hope you
104:11 - join us for the racino reception right
104:13 - behind you and thank you have a great
104:16 - week
104:17 - [Applause]
104:41 - well game development Christmas out
104:47 - there it's not even December even
104:52 - December so many incredible things in
104:55 - that keynote I can't I can't believe it
104:57 - what did you enjoy well my favorite part
105:00 - was I don't mean to be biased but I'm
105:03 - just gonna say um I've really loved the
105:05 - 2d section all our 2d features the demo
105:07 - was gorgeous and I just loved how
105:09 - everything was brought together so we've
105:10 - got so he was using the 2d renderer with
105:13 - the universal render pipeline true
105:15 - sprite shape shader graph use with 2d we
105:18 - had the sprite swap sprite shape just if
105:21 - you all wanting to create a 2-d game or
105:25 - project we just have so much great stuff
105:27 - for you is very exciting for me we were
105:30 - talking about this earlier and I love
105:31 - how you know obviously Orion the blind
105:33 - forest came out a while ago now there's
105:35 - Orion the will of the West and that kind
105:37 - of quality of 2d game obviously came
105:39 - from the team with just a ton of passion
105:41 - for making an incredible experience and
105:43 - I just love that we've we've put
105:45 - together those tools that now give you
105:47 - you know lighting and particles and yeah
105:49 - you know complex geometry for 2d it so
105:52 - cool it's just incredible it makes me
105:53 - very happy
105:54 - what about you sorry I was just rambling
105:55 - on it's fine let's talk about you for me
105:58 - it's all about I'm all about the dots
106:00 - and Livelink and bringing all of that
106:03 - stuff to production readiness is a big
106:05 - deal speaking of which so yes this is
106:08 - our opinions but let's have an opinion
106:09 - from someone that might be engineering
106:13 - welcome thank you good see you again
106:15 - it's great to be seen and this is an
106:19 - amazing turnout apologies for the delay
106:23 - but there's a crowd yeah there is a
106:25 - creek did you want ticular highlight
106:28 - this evening in the keynote
106:31 - yeah I mean for me I'm such a sucker for
106:33 - a good story and the demo team just
106:36 - knocks it out of the park every year
106:38 - every time and Heretic was like the most
106:42 - amazing you know story to date and then
106:46 - we only got to see like part one I was
106:48 - like what happens what's in the case
106:49 - what's in the box of I know that was
106:51 - really great but you actually know
106:52 - what's in the box
106:55 - [Laughter]
107:06 - awesome yeah so coming back to it we had
107:11 - lots of dots announcements tonight oh
107:13 - yes that's a big part of where we're
107:14 - going with unity in 2020 how do we
107:17 - approach us about how we approach making
107:21 - sure that dots is something that's ready
107:23 - for people's productions and appropriate
107:25 - for their needs right well like most
107:28 - things with unity you know we have a lot
107:31 - of users out there a lot of great
107:32 - customers building amazing things and
107:34 - when they're building stuff and we know
107:37 - it works then it's great and we can go
107:39 - talk to them how did you make this how'd
107:41 - you make that and we can think about
107:43 - like the solution unity is a solution
107:45 - for say a 2d platformer or a
107:47 - first-person shooter or something and so
107:50 - when it comes to dots this is really
107:52 - cutting edge stuff right and it's going
107:55 - to unlock a set of experiences that have
107:57 - never before been possible therefore
107:59 - there's nobody out there using that so
108:03 - what we've done is go and use it right
108:04 - yeah unless you can go and use it so you
108:06 - can use dots today you can put it on top
108:09 - of an existing game works great but if
108:13 - you want to go all-in on it
108:15 - there is nobody already all-in on it
108:17 - because it's brand-new technology so
108:19 - internal productions is what we spin up
108:21 - okay to support that
108:23 - and that's what they what you saw from
108:24 - the sample game team that's right the
108:26 - sample game team made the sample and
108:31 - then what we saw here was was you know
108:33 - the next generation of their of the
108:36 - shooter but using all dots all the
108:37 - pieces all integrated so we know they
108:40 - actually all work together and how
108:42 - we how do we get feedback from that team
108:44 - so that's pretty pivotal right right
108:46 - well they're actually inside of our
108:48 - studios hearing Evan Hagin here in
108:50 - Copenhagen and you know I think over the
108:53 - last couple of years you've seen like a
108:55 - growing number of technical artists and
108:57 - small productions starting to dot around
108:59 - the studios and I think it's really
109:00 - important that we're actually using
109:02 - dogfooding the features was something we
109:04 - heard from our customers we wish we like
109:07 - unique he doesn't make games but gosh we
109:09 - should make games yes as an answer we're
109:11 - pretty much oh now yeah we're pretty
109:12 - much Hornet awesome but we're dealing
109:14 - compute with our customers yeah we never
109:16 - compete with people but we're we're
109:17 - taking all of that feedback from the
109:18 - internal production and making it real
109:20 - awesome thank you so much for joining us
109:23 - thanks for so much being here and you
109:26 - know earlier when we were chatting you
109:28 - were asking me about what we're like
109:30 - most excited about in 2020 oh yes yeah
109:39 - I'm most excited about a strong growing
109:44 - investment in artists to lean in
109:46 - workflows I know when unity was invented
109:48 - a few kilometers from here it was 90
109:50 - percent programmers 10 percent artists
109:52 - nowadays it's completely opposite so you
109:55 - know starting in the few months
109:57 - remaining this year but on into next
109:59 - year this internal production idea of
110:02 - getting more artists more teams more
110:04 - people building inside of unity and
110:05 - making sure that artists around the
110:07 - world creators a little kinds of the
110:09 - best tools and workflows that's what
110:12 - that's what I'm excited about that's
110:13 - what we're investing the same thank you
110:17 - we're gonna grab some some even more
110:19 - guests so we'll see you at the show
110:21 - thank you amazing so so a lot in Aquino
110:27 - it's true lots of bases to cover lovely
110:29 - guests for you next up is my hero
110:33 - director of XR at Unity Timoney so yes
110:42 - in the keynote lots of awesome
110:44 - information yes is there anything that
110:47 - you just wanted to drill down more into
110:49 - and be like I need to tell the people
110:50 - this yes absolutely and I mean I feel
110:53 - like our section could have been in
110:55 - your keynote to really dive into it
110:56 - can't believe you didn't so the one
111:03 - thing I really want to talk about is the
111:04 - interaction toolkit which is new
111:07 - that's Matt Albie's team on the
111:08 - platforms team and it is is such a
111:10 - fantastic addition to the way you author
111:13 - for this new era of sensor driven
111:15 - computers because when it comes to how
111:19 - computers work today the traditional
111:21 - inputs that we think about are not the
111:23 - only way you work anymore you can open
111:25 - your laptop with your face right but
111:28 - it's true
111:29 - you're now your face is an input right
111:32 - you're your hands can be an input your
111:34 - voice can be an input there's all these
111:36 - new ways of interacting and especially
111:39 - when it comes to the sort of development
111:41 - kits for the wearable AR devices these
111:43 - are expensive they're hard to get
111:45 - not only would developer has access to
111:47 - them so the toolkit actually provides
111:49 - this base layer I have interactivity
111:52 - where the developer can just think to
111:53 - themselves I need to select this object
111:56 - here like I need my character to be able
111:58 - to do it or I need my user to be able to
111:59 - do it provide this layer of you know
112:02 - it's just a selection and then handle it
112:04 - across all the different types of inputs
112:07 - and all the different types of devices
112:08 - that you might need to use and that's
112:10 -  fantastic that's really opening
112:13 - up to so many developers right just
112:15 - across the yes absolutely absolutely
112:17 - it's also kind of like future proofing
112:19 - as well exactly
112:20 - yeah so how we understand so you we have
112:23 - obviously there's a are cat nail core
112:24 - then on top of that you have obviously
112:26 - unity and you have so the core audience
112:38 - for Mars when we started building it we
112:41 - really were laser focused on augmented
112:43 - reality developers today they are kitten
112:45 - core so the phones and then also the
112:48 - wearable devices but the cool thing that
112:50 - we have found out as we have built out
112:52 - this tool is that when it comes to
112:54 - augmented reality it's it's not just
112:56 - about the devices themselves it's about
112:58 - the types of data that you get in and
113:00 - again it's the gesture recognition it's
113:02 - the voice recognition it's the room mesh
113:04 - scan information and the object
113:05 - detection and so on and
113:07 - so what we've just we found is the
113:09 - workflows that we've created for these
113:11 - headsets and these phones actually works
113:14 - for all types of sort of world wear
113:17 - devices like self-driving cars or smart
113:22 - speakers so it actually opens up unity
113:25 - for a wider swath of different types of
113:27 - applications and devices working
113:29 - together than we had expected and that
113:31 - is so exciting we didn't either until we
113:36 - started to think about it more and we're
113:38 - like wait a minute
113:40 - awesome so where can people learn more
113:43 - about Mars yes we have a landing page
113:46 - where you can sign up for the closed
113:48 - beta we're taking people as they come in
113:50 - on a case by case basis just to make
113:52 - sure that we provide the proper support
113:54 - you get a technical onboarding and
113:56 - access to the package we're also have a
113:58 - blog post coming out I think on the next
114:00 - week that will give an update on the
114:02 - status and that will be more to come
114:03 - obviously next year cool thank you thank
114:09 - you have a check and finally last but
114:14 - not least not least is VP of AI and
114:19 - machine learning hello you showed some
114:22 - crazy things I'm someone who doesn't
114:29 - know about that area of the business
114:30 - that much so it's really exciting for me
114:32 - to you understand this insight into what
114:34 - you're working on and the application of
114:37 - it like what was it eleven billion miles
114:41 - before a self-driving car is certified
114:43 - as safe yeah
114:44 - and just how so she's just just sitting
114:48 - here you need to go out and get going on
114:50 - it's never gonna happen
114:52 - yeah oh you just simulate it all yeah
114:55 - and I do so apart from that which is
114:58 - incredible in itself what other
114:59 - applications of simulation could there
115:02 - be unfortunately many that's why we
115:04 - launched the service of course there's
115:07 - the whole gaming business of play
115:08 - testing you talked about self-driving
115:10 - cars yeah but we're also now seeing that
115:13 - robots are coming out of the cages yeah
115:15 - you've seen those robots in in car
115:18 - manufacturing yeah I've seen Boston
115:19 - Dynamics
115:21 - getting out and moving around yeah yeah
115:23 - you can't program those things yeah they
115:26 - just meet so many situations all the
115:29 - time yeah so what you have to do is you
115:32 - have to simulate a massive scale so
115:34 - you're providing the human behavior
115:36 - simulated for them to learn how to
115:38 - respond exactly
115:39 - people are gonna interact with these
115:41 - robots so what do we do we use the NPC's
115:44 - in unity we import the robots virtually
115:48 - into unity and then we let the NPC's
115:51 - interact with robots and the robots will
115:53 - learn there are certain things you
115:55 - shouldn't do we can hope opportunity for
116:02 - unity to use the game technology and all
116:05 - the staff that the game developers have
116:08 - sort of created over the years the
116:09 - skills the techniques and then use them
116:12 - to impact the real world yes amazing so
116:16 - going back to gaming then what are the
116:18 - implications of using this in in the
116:21 - gaming yeah I think about it this way
116:23 - games were getting more and more dynamic
116:26 - more and more adaptive yeah so you want
116:29 - to fine-tune your games you want to
116:31 - figure out how your games are gonna work
116:33 - when they're to meet the real audience
116:35 - the real human so what do you do you
116:37 - simulate you run butts against your game
116:41 - and see how it performs the different
116:44 - types of robotic players yeah it's
116:46 - basically NPCs playing the game so
116:48 - you're thinking about like you know
116:50 - procedural games where you know creating
116:53 - encounters and having you know teams of
116:56 - thousands of game designers isn't really
116:57 - an option but you know using simulation
116:59 - to create those encounters yes exactly
117:02 - and you can figure out how they work
117:04 - before you bring it bring them into the
117:06 - wild into into the market so simulations
117:10 - gonna change a lot of lying yes amazing
117:15 - yeah and where can people learn more
117:16 - about unity simulation is this earth so
117:18 - go to a website it's linked there you
117:21 - can sign up and you can join the beta
117:23 - get your things rolling Wow okay yeah
117:27 - engage these robots
117:28 - [Laughter]
117:37 - well Elizabeth it has come to an end but
117:41 - really it's only just getting started so
117:44 - you can join unite Copenhagen from home
117:46 - by just looking on any social Channel
117:49 - for a hashtag unite Copenhagen we're
117:51 - gonna be sharing stuff internally or
117:53 - everyone who's here three thousand
117:55 - people who are here are going to be
117:56 - joining and sharing stuff with you so
117:58 - make sure to look out for it there you
118:00 - can join our YouTube channel yep
118:02 - many of the talks from this week are
118:04 - going to be released on to our youtube

Cleaned transcript:

hello come into the United in 2019 keynote here live from the bella center you're joining us here if the preshow and we're very glad that you have hello well God's name is mercury how are you doing very well I'm very excited so what are we doing here it's a very good question what the devil are we doing here well we're here to count you down over the next twenty minutes leading up to the keynote no spoilers no spoilers we're not now to tell you what you're gonna see but we're gonna give you a few hints and we're gonna welcome a few guests on the stage to talk about what's coming up too so for those of you joining on YouTube on Twitch on Facebook live mix a periscope welcome you're in the right place if you want to watch the keynote and the keynotes gonna begin in 20 minutes like I said we're counting down to some amazing announcement so what are you looking forward to it is so in particular I'm looking forward to some announcements in graphics so we're going to be hearing a little bit more about the applications of the highdefinition render pipeline mmhmm and we're also going to be having a look at the universal render pipeline formerly known as the lightweight render pipeline exactly and we have a guest as well to just talk about that later which is always very exciting and do you what about you I'm looking forward to the latest on dots the data oriented tech stack so we are going to be showing you we've talked about performance a lot in the past we're going to show you how that performance kind of permeates out to convenience and workflow and frankly I think we're going to show you something that you've never seen before in a game engine and I'm really excited it's very cool one section I'm particularly excited about as well it's we're gonna have our VP of AI Danny Lang telling us about the applications of simulation in unity I'm so excited I can't wait few there's some really incredible stuff and it stretches beyond game development out to all kinds of other industries too and of course connected games too yes so we're gonna see something from my finger about their solution for connected games which is very exciting indeed that's true that's true so there's over 150 sessions at you know there's there's a lot of content right there's like almost 3,000 people yeah I mean good good two waves there and so the atmosphere here is buzzing the as always at unity we have a made with unity showcase yes so what would a unite be without a made with unity showcase so major theme to showcase brings together all the projects and games from our creators which is always extremely exciting so we've got not just games but we've got film and animation we've got architecture engineering construction automotive whatever industry you are in we have something for you that's if you're not here if you're there what made with unity gems have you been playing oh me well I've been playing congratulations to all creators who released last week yep so there's what you're seeing right now sign our wild hearts by simogo I love this game this you've got it's a stunning rhythm based game it's like a pop album video game you are lady who's been transformed into a pop super heroine and you're fighting and you're I was also playing Jenny Lee clue so this is stunning like it's been develop for a long time I've been following it really closely it's an adventure game it's really really funny and it kind of reminded me of you know the classic days of LucasArts adventure games she's solving a mystery in her town and it looks fantastic highly recommend that that's great and then the other one I was playing was punch planet I love a beat'em up yeah and I love with the popculture references like Wibbly Ripley there and yeah you know I'm sure there's no copyright problems with that it's an absolutely awesome game and of course coming up soon as well is a manifold garden from William cheer this games been in in the works for a long time and it looks absolutely unique I absolutely adore this game and I can't wait to find out what it is so what about the showcase is there anything you're excited about here yeah of course so in the showcase we have lots of games as well I've been following this moment for a while he's here tonight at the show feedings game recompile so this is a 3d Metro Vania action games set inside a computer so it's great like Tron + metroid prime plus I don't know whatever else it it's just stunning I mean you can see for yourself right it looks great and what view playing this at the show well I'm very excited to see seed so seed is Bible in based clan games and the first thing that I dreamy it was its minimalistic art style I absolutely loved it and it's actually quite deceiving because the art style does not sort of portray everything that is in this game sector it's a sandbox MMO in which players can create their own ecosystems so you have a seedling and you can cultivate that seedling a seedling has wants and needs like human beings and you cultivate and listen to your seedlings you can like create your own colony and have relationships develop there and this those like cultivations also take out going on when you're not playing so it's just one of those games I'm going to think ours into I just think I am also and as I said it's not just games in the made with unity showcase of course we have median entertainment so the scene the scene that you can see now is a kites tail by Walt Disney Animation Studios so this is the second short animation virtual reality animation so this is all handdrawn animations brought into the medium of VR which is very very exciting and just looks beautiful and it's also very Disney in its story it's about two kites as you can see a very different that just learn to live together and coexist beautifully I guess other projects and other creators their creative process and all that good stuff on the made with unity website which is made with unity calm marvelous and obviously we wanted to give a big shout out to the rest of the unity indie community that's not been featured just now so we put together this indie celebration real for you to take a look at some of those great games let's take a look at it right now tons and tons of great unity talent going out into those games thanks so much for doing what you do we absolutely love all of them list you know I love about those games what's that graphics well there's a good job that you enjoy graphic yeah look who we have with us oh my goodness it's IRISA Scott our product manager for graphics what an incredible coincidence hi IRISA hi will how are you doing really good thank you for joining us we won't keep you long cuz I know you're gonna be spilling some graphical beans in the keynote itself so I want to dive right in there Universal window pipeline mmm previously referred to as the lightweight winter pipeline and so they're not two separate entities nope so in 2019 point three we have renamed lightweight to Universal so lightweight was originally a more targeted solution focused on mobile being super performant and a little bit more of a narrow focus and its feature set is grown and it's evolved it's still super performance but it offers like fantastic visuals and more flexibility so all lightweight users when they get 20 19.3 from their point of view it's a name change with more features awesome so what differentiates that from from our built in a renderer for example more flexibility it's also more performant so because it's a single forward pass renderer you know we've got some exciting stats in the keynote and there are a lot of artists tools like VFX graph and shader graph we also have a new postprocessing stack which is integrated directly into Universal gives you more performance and also you know beautiful visuals awesome speaking of beautiful visuals we're taking a look at the spaceship demo right now and this is H GRP right so what's the difference there with HDR P what kind of ad addons on top of what you would get with Universal could you so HDR P is more targeted compute capable platforms are high in platforms like Xbox ps4 and you have things like volume metrics and a much richer PBR that is even more realistic than what we offer in Universal and a lot of other great features like subsurface scattering and all the other acronyms you might want and and like here we're seeing a lot of great VFX graph work for this demo oh yeah and we have good news about the FX graph right it's now working with shader both yeah so you can offer your shaders and so I trade your graph use those directly and VFX graph to get even more gorgeous effects awesome so Liz ray tracing I don't know why you asking me Arisa tell us a little bit more about ray tracing I know that we've previously released blog post about this but can you tell us a little bit more about what we can expect and how we can get our hands on it so you can download 29.3 and use HD RP our ray tracing solution is built directly on top of a CRP so if you have that package just upgrade and it'll be there it'll be there and if you have the hardware then you'll be able to kind of scale upwards even further and you don't once have it work with both HD RP and with ray tracing and a nice thing about our solution for ray tracing is it's the final frame entirely an editor so you're seeing ray tracing within the editor yep and so you can kind of iterate much faster very cool well it's nearly keno time so I think you should probably I love having a guest I think we have another guest and you know from one Hot Topic graphics to another one of the hottest topics in gaming at the moment is cloud based gaming and to talk to us a little bit more about that we have some your Peterson farm stadia thank you so much for joining us thanks so much for having me really excited to be here at unite so the Google stadia service launches in November for players but obviously your audience right now and back here is unity developers so what advice do you have for unity developers and how do they get onto the stadia platform sure so the good news is we've been working with unity for over a year now so we're almost there and back at GDC this year we launched the stadia partnerships program if you haven't heard about it it's a program that we've generated to engage with developers regardless of their size so support opportunities range from financial to production support to marketing and we really tailor those to the individual opportunity and the individual developer so you're kind of solving some of the kind of like publishing aspects of getting the game out absolutely Italy about helping them bring their games to market in the best way possible sweet that sounds like an incredible opportunity how like what advice would you give to any of the developers who are watching that want to take advantage of this partnership absolutely so first and foremost it'll surprise you to learn that we're looking for games people want to play right so he amongst that is that they're playable so we're looking for games that are in development and more important than that is we're really interested in developers who want to take full advantage of the power of stadia so either the backend or some of our YouTube integration features you might have 300 enemies in a battle on screen and a single instance or you could use crowd boost crowd play or state share which are some of our youtube integrations that you can read all about those on our blog I was gonna say if you want to find out they can go to stadia yeah stadia Devi's where you go to learn about those so what is the actual application process like how to people what's it going to be like they want to apply it they've got a want to show you today sure so the initial application process is really important that's where we're getting to learn about you as a developer so you need to submit your web domain your developer background we want gameplay footage or early playable we're obviously looking for developers with recent history in certified storefronts experience in consoles is very interesting it's not a prerequisite but it's definitely a nice to have and clearly we'd like developers from unity and with expertise in unity incredible so people can head to stay be a dev to find out more about partnership but also about the stadia features right absolutely had to stadia to register your interest well have a great show Samuel thank you so much for joining us and good luck finding all of this talent out here yeah thanks very much you so much cool so we are going to pivot back to unity for a moment now so Liz I don't know about you but I've used unity since like 2008 because I'm very very old and it's always kind of look the same so thankfully in 20 19.3 we're getting a bit of a restyle thanks to this lady Mary Luther hi Mary hey well nice suit thank you so much for joining us Thanks so why are we doing this now it's been a long time it's been how long did you tell me earlier well it's been about 14 years and we've had the same style in the editor pretty much the whole time yeah and so unity is growing a lot and as you're gonna see a unite we have more awesome teams than ever creating new features for unity true so it's really important that we have a system that is cohesive and consistent so that everything can work together yeah and so how did she get started with the redesign what was the process yeah so the first thing we did was just talk to users and what we found when we did this is kind of like we could categorize them to three main areas so the first major area was just that people told us that the editor felt really dated like you guys were just talking about so we did user research to find out more and really sit down listen and observe people working in unity to see how these things affected the usability of the product so what people told us is that they felt that the editor was actually less usable and had a lower quality because just of the way it looked it's like a pop perception thing as well yeah totally we call it aesthetic usability in the in the UX world and then of course we had real kind of usability issues related to people kind of losing the context of where they were in the editor so that's kind of the second main area okay yeah okay so like am I in the hierarchy am I in the scene view and then I added the inspector and then I've edited the wrong thing and then I'm angry those kind of issues and then the third one was just lots of little inconsistencies like everywhere and little usability issues so like text it was just too small to read yeah or too late to see lots of things just slightly out of alignment and just like a million other little inconsistencies yeah for sure I mean we can we can see the the redesign on screen right now and we can hopefully show you a little video clip of the sidebyside between nineteen to and nineteen three so tell us a little bit about the differences we've got here obviously there's a bit of a flat design compared to the old look yeah so one thing that's really common right now is modern apps are sort of taking over the landscape of tech is everybody's going flat and so that could be actually really bad for usability if you go to flat it's really hard to tell the difference between a text input and a dropdown and it can really kind of mess you up so the challenge for us was to add an up like settle depth cues to support usability while really making a nice modern style yeah it feels like like and I think like we got a lot of feedback on the form as well that there was you know like a good compromise between the flat and you know adding those cues for people yeah so one of those things when we were kind of thinking about this as we talk to users and we did a lot of refinement and iteration on the on the forums and also via surveys to kind of get things at like a really good level of detail because that's what this kind of an effort takes and then like the other thing that we did was we added over the past couple releases things like tab focus yeah and hover and I mean all these things have come in over the last couple so they're not new for 20 19.3 but they've been all part of this effort so we've added them as soon as we technically can and that's been really helpful so that when you actually are you know modifying an object and editing in the inspector you're like less likely to make a mistake which is may has made me feel better working in unity I like lose don't lose my place as often as I used to exactly sounds amazing and so what's actually coming next you know we've seen 19.3 and what that looks like what's coming up in the future of the editor as far as you're concerned twenty 19.3 is actually just the first stage of kind of like a bigger effort to continue modernizing the editor and so the next things we really want to focus on our usability accessibility and then of course use our workflows to make kind of unity a better experience for as many types of users as possible and we're just gonna listen to the user so we're gonna let the users lead us where they lead us in these areas and we're gonna just continue to kind of reach out and talk to them on the forums and I do actually want to say thanks everybody over the past year out there that kind of worked with us on the forums filled out like the three million surveys on theming that we put out because all that feedback we were able to make most the majority of those changes that's pretty much all I've done for the past year was listen to feedback and make stuff better yeah cool so of course the editor theme isn't the only thing that's coming to make your life better in unity we have a ton of quality of life improvements coming to the editor very soon and we've put together a quick trailer to show you some of the great things that are coming up in 19.3 and 20.1 let's take a look at the quality of life real right now okay lots of amazing stuff in that video lots to talk about but you're about to be blown away by some even more cool stuff in the keynote right now let's do this 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 enjoy the keynote you please welcome cats Trafford welcome to unite Copenhagen we are so excited that you all are here one of the things that makes unities community so unique and special is that people come from everywhere to come together at unite share ideas share the latest technology collaborate and make new friends so thank you all for joining us we have a really exciting week ahead so we want to extend a big welcome not just to everyone in the room here but also to everyone on the livestream we hope you're gonna enjoy the show with us and we also would like to welcome all the speakers all the demo airs partners and the people who brought this all together and made it possible so welcome so we have a week full of a hundred and fifty sessions tons and tons of demos across the expo floor as well as unite at night that I hope you all make it to and of course the one thing you've asked a lot for which is more time and more experts at the expert bar so before I move on though I want to take a special minute to or second to recognize our beta testers where are you are you right here yes thank you thanks for making unity better every day and helping everyone enjoy it we really appreciate all that you do you guys are kind of grinning sheepishly but we really appreciate it thank you all right so tonight John is gonna share how the power of realtime 3d is transforming the way we all create Lucas and team are gonna share more about our data oriented tech stack timoney and team are going to share around our AR toolset including Mars AR foundation and some new features that we haven't shared yet Danny and team sorry just Danny actually he's gonna share more around simulation an erisa and team are going to demonstrate our latest on graphics including 2d features our new scriptable render pipelines as well as a few other surprises and we're going to hear from some special guests so let's dive in who first shared their stories in caves connected art nature and science led us toward new horizons who thought to capture motion sparking engine to life turn television into a playground every day you create the playful the functional and the unexpected you break down walls and take us to astonishing places tell stories leave borders and create beauty for tomorrow because at Unity we believe the world is a better place with more creators in it where everyone has a chance to shape the world please welcome John Ricca Telo good evening and welcome to unite in Copenhagen on behalf of everybody at Unity we welcome you all here and we're thrilled to be here it was only a couple kilometers away from here where it all started when fifteen years ago the very first lines of unity were written now together with all of you an amazing group of developer partners and customers we've achieved more than we ever thought possible we built a better game engine and you've built amazing games today games built on unity account for approximately 50 percent of all games on every platform in every country in the world in just the last 12 months games you've built were downloaded 34 billion times think about that for a minute if you do the math that's 53 downloads of a unity based game the stuff you build every second 30 53 per second and over this time our industry has entered its golden era today gaming is a hundred and fifty billion dollar industry far surpassing film and music to become the largest entertainment medium on the planet and we've gotten there through great games like inside by play dead sayonara wild hearts or Nintendo's Mario Kart tour from you and collectively we surpassed these other media through innovation taking advantage of the massive increase in compute power and networks to help you deliver Brown groundbreaking content and it gets better from here the constraints we face you're falling away with magnitudes better performance processing streaming the evolution of technology will part power gaming farther than ever before and because we're the enablers of the most important or one of the most important and significant technologies of our time realtime 3d mastery of realtime 3d technology and tools means you can be the agents of change for the gaming industry but our shared technology that we use to make games has also helped us become the leading entertainment media in the world and will take us to other industries as well realtime 3d is already proving to be invaluable across industries that help design build and sell the most complex projects ranging from cars to airplanes to skyscrapers such as designing and testing augmented reality experiences that don't exist yet like Volvo has done with Vario or how a construction company Mortenson created in design medical operation Suites in VR before constructing such critical venues in real life or Bill Bell building virtual prototypes of the FCX helicopter for design and test piloting you are the pioneers of the realtime 3d revolution this is a revolution transforming all content all creation across dozens of industries and you started it that which is static will move that which was not social will be connected that which was 2d and flat will be 3d realtime and immersive it's game makers like you and pioneers and other industries many of them here tonight at unite that will lead the world into the next realm of creative possibility so get ready to shape the world now before we welcome Lucas to the stage please join me in taking a look at some of the incredible things you've made with unity please welcome Lucas Mayer good see well here I get to talk about our data oriented technology stack a gentleman here heard about it and when when he heard about it he probably heard us talk about performance performance performance performance and performance by default in particular the reason we talk about that so much is because we focus on it because it's the one part of the game engine that you cannot add back later on however what about convenience let's talk about some programmer convenience if you're a programmer that once you used us today you kind of start like this you make a component but to use it in the editor you have to make this authoring components to make it do something you need to make a system to make it do that fast you need to make a job and then to run the job you need to schedule that job so you could say well I don't know Lucas that sounds like a lot of work to move something around and you'd be kind of right because there's only a few lines in this page of code that actually have some programmer intent so the next release of dots tries to help with this we'll start with this authoring component at the top instead of us asking you to write it you can ask the compiler to write it but just adding this generates authoring component attributes here in the bottom with the struct let's remove that for a second and let's replace it with the entities dot for each statement I'll get to that in a second but if you compare this to what we started with that's already a substantial improvement in terms of the amount of boilerplate that you need to deal with now let's take a look at this new code the programmers in the room they might have had a little heart attack because there's a lump expression in here those cost G's see allocations and those cost GC spikes and those caused complaining customers in the next dots release we're making the lambda expression in the entity step for each we're making it special instead of running it as normal she sharp we converted into that same job structs that we were asking you to write manually before so when you use this construct you the unity job system to go wide over all your course however it also uses burst if you look at the burst inspector for this code you can see that the inner loop uses these XML 1 XML 2 registers these are simply instructions that operate on multiple elements at the same time so not only are you going wide over all your course on each of those course you're going wide using all the sim delaine's and that's a great place for us to be and when you can have the most optimal code you could write but where you can write it in a relatively humane way that doesn't come at the expense of that performance another great convenient thing for programmers in dots is that when we ship dots we ship it to you as csharp source packages if you've played around with dots that means that the complete source code of dots and all the features that are built on top of it are on your left up in your backpack under your chair right now if you make a dots game and you grab a debugger and you start single stepping through your game code you'll step through your game code into our adults code into the physics code into the net code into the animation engine you can see everything you can change everything you can make fun of my incredibly verbose local variable names many people do that I won't give up though because in dots there's no more black boxes you can see everything alright enough with these programmers let's get you off him and Martin on stage Thank You Lucas now Lucas talked about how to write code for dots but you also need a great tool to create your content and for dots we're going to use the exact same unity editor you know and love already so Martin let's take a look at some content yeah so let's jump into a prototyping level here it's built exactly like you would expect in unity it's made out of prefabs nested prefabs game objects and components if we look at this sphere we'll see it's as you know it it has a mesh filter render a sphere Collider the only difference is that we have runtime converting this game object data into entity representation and in dots we make a distinction between the data that the game code operates on and the data that content creators use and bridging those two worlds is a conversion workflow it converts from a authoring friendly game object representation to runtime optimized entities and this optimized dots data is streamable it's compact and it's optimal for performance and in the preview inspector you can see that conversion in happening life so when Martin changes the physics buddy to be dynamic you can see the inspector update here and you can see exactly what these runtime game code components that are actually being used at runtime are being generated from your very simple to easy on easy to use understand authoring representation up there now to build a game you need at least a couple of core features so we built a thirdperson shooter and it uses all the brand new dots features animation physics rendering and netcode together and we made a very small simple sample project with the purpose of being easy to understand and digest so Lucas let's have a play alright let's go alright where are you everyone should know that Joe made me promise to lose good takeaway so what you see here this is running on our FPS net code it is built on top of dots and it makes it easy to create any network game using an FPS net code architecture it has everything that you would expect clientside prediction lack compensation and interpolation are all builtin we're also using the new unity animation package it is high performance very flexible and there are no black boxes every character in this game uses runtime I K as you can see here the feet are perfectly sticking to the to the chrome ball we use unity physics for the character controller sliding along the walls jumping and going over the floor we're using Ray casts from Unity physics for the shooting and for rendering we're using the script over in the pipelines with a dots based rendering component for optimal performance so Martin the only thing I'm just not too sure about in this is the color scheme you picked yeah the baby blue might be an issue and we can try and find something a bit cooler that's why there's a grat grass like more green buy that I save and boom there you have it on your device I can also try something else maybe that didn't work out that beautifully but like a midnight purple do that alright push it alright so that's a big deal because Martin has all the color wasn't that nice it's a big deal because Martin has this project opening the editor but me and you welcome we are running built players that are running the game and he's making a change in the editor on the left but it's affecting the players while they're running the game that don't have to reboot yeah so since I'm generating runtime ready data on the editor and there's no reason that I can't push it to any device so what kind of changes can you make anything really if you look at the the chrome sphere Joe then I can you know make translations I can duplicate and you know make another sphere and go back to geo the static component that I touched on the physics party make it dynamic they'll fall down collide maybe topple over if we were lucky there we go so yeah and then I didn't even make changes to shaders let's go into my shader graph we're like any good TV chef I prepared a little effect that we can drop on save so that's what I really love about this feature that it's what I really love I was running out the tablet you're welcome what's running on a desktop we could also attach a console in a phone and they would all attached to the same editing session and when Martin makes a change those bags out the the entity data for each of those devices individually so that means that he can see the changes on all of those devices without the devices having to restart or the games having to reboot and there's no matter the device it could be a console or iPhone or anything really so what does that do to your workflow as an artist yeah as an environment artists this means I can build my entire world on the device with direct feedback on actual device performance it'll be immediately visible to me if I have performance head room in one space of the level and I can add more detail there or if I need to optimize in another part of the level and instead of looking through complex profiling tools I can simply hide or delete elements and see the performance impact on the scene so in I believe this will have an incredible impact on your productivity unfortunately all of these features unity animation FPS netcode live link and conversion flow will ship as preview packages alongside unity 2000 19.3 and we're also going to make the full project folder that we just showed you with all source code and assets available very soon right thank you thank you please welcome Brandi house from unkilled to Shadowgun legends madfinger has consistently pushed the boundaries of what's possible with mobile multiplayer gameplay one of the hardest problems developers face today we know that for unity to build the best multiplayer tools we need a battle test our tech and some of the most challenging scenarios out there enter mad fingers shadow gun more games a tournament style mobile title designed for eSports coming out later this year when you say you're the best shooters why do you say you're the best shooters because it's true general allegiance is social shooter so you can get in into the hop you can make friends you can play emotes you can set a match and you can go fight against audience the other side war games is very quick there is almost no social staff of course there goes support friends support girls but the game is designed to be super quick to jump in shoot making games challenge this is why I'm doing it this is what I love from very beginning from the first idea or for the final product everything it's challenging the challenges start with building but they go on forever once it's a living game whoops unity provides us is dedicated server which allows you to control what player can do and cannot you don't need to rely on clients and of course the biggest challenge is dealing with cheaters you know they're ruining the game to others No so we have to fight them using dedicated servers one big advantage you can run full simulation of the game on the servers which means you have a low latency you have full control and when gone in the game and they just won't be able to do those nasty stuff I must say that using unity matchmaker is more simple because it plugable and it provides all infrastructure and allows me to focus only on the matchmaker logic itself we got very close relationship with the unity and because unity cars so we can do games the best games ever to create games of this caliber you need to ensure your games don't lag prevent shooters from ruining your game quickly bring players together into fair matches and open communication channels that feel safe for everyone unity worked alongside madfinger to bring all of this into wargames madfinger started with our new unity transport package which enables rapid transfer of data to and from the game server keeping players in sync with as low latency as possible next they integrated our dedicated server hosting and matchmaking to seamlessly connect players to servers across the globe with our matchmaker madfinger defined which players they wanted to group together with custom csharp match functions and we handled the rest and finally they plugged into our bestinclass voice communications to provide their players with an immersive social experience as madfinger has shown you unity transport package available in preview dedicated server hosting matchmaking in beta next month and voice communications provide the foundation to build a worldclass multiplayer experience thank you please welcome Timoney West and Brittany Edmunds if you want to make powerful deeply interactive augmented reality experiences that intelligently interact with the real world you are in the right place because you need the right tools to build intelligent AR experiences and we're building them for you we've built features that not only unlock the next generation of AR experiences but that help me creating these experiences much easier that's right yeah Mars is our suite of design and simulation tools that is built to make the workflow that much faster it allows you to prototype test and ship much more quickly than ever it sits on top of our AR foundation framework and it allows you to create a our experiences that work the way we really want AR to work contextaware flexible customizable work in any location and with any kind of data without requiring tons of code ok so let's talk about some of the ways that Mars makes your life easier ok so you can be constantly testing without having to make a device build and this is enabled through the Mars alwayson query system which is very cool our simulation view and our environment templates and you can auto oriented applications using what you see is what you get interface you can literally drag and drop objects into the simulation view just like in real life and we have visual gizmos to help you actually layout objects in the space and just lay out your scene and you can use any kind of AR data and there is a lot so object tracking gesture detection body tracking face tracking all of these different types of data and we are futureproofing as well to make sure that we can take advantage of all the new cool types of data that are coming down the pipe and to make the development process even faster and more accurate Mars will have companion apps for AR devices the first iteration will be from mobile phones we're giving you a quick sneak peek right here you'll be able to sync projects in the unity cloud and then layout assets as easily as placing a 3ds you'll be able to use your phone to create conditions and record video and world data and export it straight back into the editor without having to make a build of your project I tell you that video part was really hard to get right okay and the next iteration of course is going to be for wearable AR devices the magic leap on the hololens and it's the same idea in mind you're sitting in your space you're taking in world data you have it on the headset and you can export it directly back into the editor to author against just same concept okay so there you go we've got Mars and that is our work environment for AR development but of course we want you to be able to take your AR experiences and get them into as many hands as possible and we have you covered there too Dan welcome to the stage thanks Tony a our foundation allows you to build your experience once and ship it on all major platforms in phase a our ecosystem each platform has similar core features but they each have different workflows and nuances to enable them we do the work to unify these so that you can simply enable the feature once in unity using a our foundation and that feature seamlessly works across all of the platforms if a feature is enabled on one platform but isn't available on another we put in the hooks so when the feature becomes available it's easy to put it into an existing app or experience simply by updating your packages not rebuilding your app from scratch this framework also gives you the ability to take advantage of all of the awesome features and workflows were building for unity so that you can create truly robust AR apps that are ready to ship to internal stakeholders or on any app stores and we're not just talking about mobile anymore that's because AR foundation now extends to wearable AR devices for the first time ever you can build an experience once and ship it on AR kit AR core hololens and magiclip devices and we you're building an experience to any or all of these devices we know that you're going to want your user to actually be able to interact with that content in a variety of ways like scaling rotating repositioning it just to name a few we also know that coding these object interactions from scratch for each device and every new platform is really time consuming so we're giving you the ability to add interactivity to your AR and VR applications simply by adding components to your objects this brand new XR interaction toolkit handles everything from touches and gestures on mobile devices all the way up to tracked controllers and even tracked hands this toolkit is coming out in preview in 2019 point 3 and now we want to leave you with one final note having to completely rebuild your app from scratch in order to add AR functionality to it is time consuming and painful and we know that it's actually a nonstarter for some of you so we're officially giving you the ability to embed the full power unity inclusive of our AR offerings directly into any native app that already exists today and with that capability combined with Mars AR foundation and the X our interaction toolkit we're giving you the tools to build powerful augmented reality experiences that intelligently interact with the real world and reach the widest possible audience thank you please welcome Adam Chernykh hi everyone at chop Architects were focused on innovation we've done projects such as the uber headquarters in San Francisco and US embassies around the world one of our most recent projects is a skyscraper it's currently under construction in New York City it's set to become the tallest structure in Brooklyn it's also the first project that's using unity reflect which is a new product from unity but before I jump into that let me give you a little bit of background see architects and engineers have been using 3d for a long time the technology is called building information modeling or simply BIM see now with unity reflect we can actually do a lot more with this BIM information with these BIM models until recently the time it took to get these BIM models into real time engines was far from realtime it actually took teams days or weeks in order to optimize and convert these models into real time ready assets and this really didn't align with the speed of iteration that we needed in our office and of course the consequence was that not a lot of our projects made it into real time engines but now with unity reflect it's easy for any architect or designer to take their BIM models and data into unity and this is a big deal this is a gamechanger for our industry so let me show you a little bit about it so the first thing to note is that you get a couple things out of the box with unity reflect you get a plugin into our BIM software Autodesk Revit as well as a reflect viewer application so here we are in Autodesk Revit and we have our entire model for that tower project in Brooklyn and this is actually the model that we use to create construction documents to get this building built and I have another view here that just isolates the exterior window panels of this model and this is actually what we're gonna focus on in this demo is these exterior windows so first off what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull in all this geometry into the box viewer and this is the out of the box viewer we have over here on the right all I have to do is open up these projects and pull it in and you'll notice how fast it is to get this model into this out of the box reflect viewer and you can navigate and isolate specific components and another very very important thing to note is the live link function so if I click this button right here we're actually creating a live link between our BIM software and the reflect viewer so if we come down to this awning here and that looks a little bit small so let's make it a little bit bigger we're gonna be able to see this updated live in the viewer and this is huge if we're making changes with clients or general contractors we're gonna be able to get these updates in AR or in VR in real time this is very important and this is what you get out of the box with reflect but since it's built on unity we're able to customize and build on top of this technology and so that's actually what we're most excited about here at shelf architects so I'm going to show you the first thing that we built with unity reflect which is a panel status tracking application for the exterior windows of this tower so if we jump back into Revit really quick here I want to show you one thing if I toggle through and grab one of these panels we'll see all of the associated metadata over here in the left side and we'll see this one specific piece of metadata here panel status and this piece of data is what we're going to be looking for over in the unity editor so if we jump into unity now I'm gonna show you how easy it is to set up a reflect project I have the reflect package here I'm just gonna drag and drop in the reflect prefab and hit play and what you're gonna notice is that right out of the gates what we get is the exact same functionality as the reflect viewer that you had just seen but now that we're since we're in unity we can actually look and dive in a little bit and customize so I'm going to jump into this root game object and I'm going to show you that this is actually where this model instantiate it itself and we're gonna see over on the Left when I select a panel here all of that metadata that we had in our BIM software is now accessible in unity this is huge including this panel status parameter which is what our custom script is going to be looking for so if I kill this really quick and I look at our main camera I have a custom script here that I'm just going to turn on and I'm gonna give it a couple inputs so I'm gonna give it this manager and I'm gonna give it this root game object and I'm gonna rerun it so what we're able to do here is we're actually able to grab that piece of data and then we're gonna change the material of each of these panels based on that panel status piece of data so it's going to come in here and then it's going to change the colors of these panels and these panels these colors of these panels are indicative to the status of that panel on the construction site whether that panel is complete whether that panel is in transit on its way to the construction site or maybe there's an issue associated with that panel there's a crack and it needs to be replaced and all we have to do now is switch the build target out to iOS and build out a mobile a RF and I actually have the finished app here on my iPad and I'll show you guys the AR they are finished at so this is an AR foundation app so it's a multi platform so all I have to do here is scan the floor and drop our model and you're gonna see here that we have the tower with V with all of these panels here and since now it's interactive in an AR app I can select a panel and in the top left you're going to see the panel status of that is in progress we're getting that bim data information back into an augmented reality application and this is really really important but this is still just the first step this is still really just the first step reviewing designs in the office is great but what we're most excited about is to get this technology on to the construction site so that we can help transform our industry by better connecting design and construction see we actually took one of our first reflect applications on site to the construction site of this tower in Brooklyn and began you'll see that our construction team is overlaying these BIM models in data in real time on top of this construction site and this is very very valuable this is going to help us catch design flaws fast solve problems faster and inevitably decrease the time it takes to build ultimately what this means is designing and building in more efficient and sustainable ways thank you please welcome danny lang thank you thank you good evening as creators you're faced with many questions around the quality safety and stability of your products in an ideal world you would want to explore all questions and all possibilities but unfortunately you're bound by time inadequate information and limited resources of the physical world we live in but fortunately we have unity a virtual world that is spatial where you have physics and visual fidelity and all the interactions you need to simulate any experience however the scope of your simulations is currently limited to the hardware at hand that is until today introducing unity simulation our new cloudbased simulation product backed by Google cloud unity simulation enables you to automatically run multiple instances of your unity projects at an incredible scale and on a variety of hardware you can now test your products at any point in the development process you can train your systems on millions or even billions of scenarios and edge cases and you can validate your concepts without any upfront hardware investments unity simulation is already breaking barriers across industries take for example a selfdriving car it needs to drive at least 11 billion miles before it is considered safe with a traditional training method you'd maybe get to this goal in a hundred years and each time an update is made to a piece of hardware or software in the car systems the whole thing needs to be revalidated across a suite of test cases but with unity simulation you can drive sooner by running millions of test scenarios parallel in the cloud for example the LG as we held simulator is LG Electronics autonomous vehicle simulator it takes advantage of several advanced unity features such as the highdefinition rendering pipeline the job systems and the best compiler does that to simulate photorealistic digital trend of realworld environments with accurate vehicle and sensor models developers can now build and test their autonomous vehicles by running a diverse set of scenarios running these simulations on the desktop would take months at least but with LG svl simulator running on unity simulation you can train more quickly safely and likely save some money too while simulation can help invent the future it's also crucial to solving everyday tasks that are important yet laborintensive and tedious such as finetuning for game balance before soft launching again we have been working with a logical a 37 person game studio based in Canada on the upcoming title row raises illogical wanted to up level the player experience an engagement through game balancing they had to address some questions that were tough to answer especially when you have tight deadlines and you know that our skilled players beating on skilled players by a big margin are their combinations of cards or powerups that would lead to big advantages for player in the first case of a skilled player beating an unskilled by a big margin illogical wanted to test many different game settings to find the one that would even out the playing field and keep the game fund for all using unity simulation illogic had decided to do a grid search and basically explore all combinations of possible values for three parameters in the game to find the one combination that would optimized for best results in logic I ran over 22,000 simulations in a matter of hours instead of the weeks it would have taken with human players doing this okay with unity simulation illogic was able to quickly understand which settings would lead to an enhanced player experience scale is no longer a barrier with unity simulation but we're not finished doing simulations at scale is critical to achieving big goals but what if you're a smaller game studio who just needs a simple fast way for you to optimize your game for your individual players well future play is here to tell you more thank you please welcome tatu Lane future play games is a small studio of 34 people based in Helsinki our most notable games are idle farming Empire and balance Royale which together have over 65 million downloads as a game designer my job is to keep players in the game idle farming mbar is over four years old and we're constantly looking for ways to improve our metrics and keep things fresh I need to provide a constant flow of new content features and events I have so many ideas I want to test but every test requires an analyst a programmer an artist it can take weeks to design and even longer to roll out and analyze the results and as a small studio that's just not feasible for example our store hadn't been updated in over three years so last month we decided to make a better version of our store we thought it would be a small thing but it turned out we were wrong players hated the new store we had to drop everything we were doing to roll it back it took us way too long to correct our mistake and roll out a fix we needed something to help us iterate faster to make smarter decisions that don't come at the cost of losing players so when we learned about game tune a decision engine powered by machine learning optimizes your game in real time we were all in I was excited that there was something that acted and learned fact faster than us one of the tests we ran was for tutorial progression speed and we set the game to to optimize for de7 retention we then gave it four different speeds to choose from from very slow to very fast and we assumed that there was no way the slowest speed could win but we assumed wrong again game tune was able to immediately identify the slowest speed as the best variable and we started seeing positive results in just a few days and we didn't even need to analyze the results because the game was adjusted in real time we would have never tested these extreme settings without game tune because the risk of losing players was too high with game tune we could be more bold and as a result we were able to inject new life into the game and we now retain 5% more players every day and run double the tests we used to the time we save on testing now gets foot toward developing and optimizing features thanks to game tune we now have the power of a large machine learning team they live to deliver the best experience to our players thank you please welcome IRISA Scott the Uni graphics team lives to create bestinclass graphics technology performant stateoftheart visuals along with intuitive artist workflows that's our driving force when it comes to graphics you need power to push your visuals and control to be able to decide what matters to you most we are investing in our render technology with the scriptable render pipelines giving you direct control over what you need you could take advantage or to render pipelines out of the box use them as a starting point for your own solution or customize them to meet your needs the High Definition render pipeline is best to use if your goal is more targeted pushing graphics as far as you can and highend hardware delivering powerful performance high fidelity visuals it's a fully featured offering in twenty nineteen point three now out of preview bringing stunning graphics and photo realism at game ready set frame rates your HD RP assets will scale and fidelity on highend platforms taking the best advantage of the available hardware resources for best visual quality and you only have to author at once with our full suite of production ready artist tools such as VFX graph shader graph postprocessing the second pipeline is Universal render pipeline formerly known as lightweight render pipeline which is best to use if you want full unity platform reach with bestinclass visual quality and performance it's a powerful solution right out of the box with a full suite of artist tools for content creation most importantly it visually scales the capabilities of the hardware to all platforms at Unity targets we believe it's important that you have the right tool for the right job you now have a range of options you can constantly build off of right now and for the future and if 2d is where you live our new suite of tools will unlock even more creativity let's take a look please welcome Andy touch and Jennifer Nord wall we love 2d whether it's an RPG or a match 3 game some of today's most successful games are 2d including 75 of the top 100 mobile games and we've been working to raise the bar for development across the board to not only help you create what you want but also improve the experience of how you create it so let's take a look at the 2d tools working together but Before we jump in I want to give a very big thank you to back to the game studio based in Montreal who made the lovely project that Jennifer and I are about to show you this project is called The Lost crypt it was created using the universal render pipeline which now has a built in 2d renderer really dedicated to making art truly shine the 2d renderer introduces a wealth of new graphics features that you can see throughout these environments from the glowing particles that were in the air so the characters dynamic shadow being caused by the magic wand onto the Crypt wall and the rich town of the forest and these little spirit sprites is a result of our new native 2d lighting system that mood variety and depth to create this mystical nighttime atmosphere so let's go behind the scenes to see how the new 2d tools helped bring this project to life so previously to create a day/night cycle you'd make many different versions of every sprites in the level but 2d lights make this much much easier all sprites can be reused in every lighting condition and as you can see as jennifer moves this slider it controls a wide variety of lights that dynamically modify everything that you see in the scene and here we have what we call a 2d point lights this has a wide range of insane gizmos to visually control how it illuminates the scene you may notice that the lights intensity and also the falloff are also influenced in the normal maps on the background star map wall and this scene looks great but a layer of visual polish can be added to take it to that next level shader graph and postprocessing work together with the 2d renderer and the visual effects of this water sprites were composed entirely using shader graph and as we can see the water refracts the dungeon floor and also reflects the 2d lights shader graph allows you to create 2d shaders with absolutely no code by connecting these very visual nodes together so let's take a look at the organic let's look a look at the creation of organic terrains in the past a team will need to create manage and also layout many individual little sprites and colliders entirely separately but with sprite shape you define all your data in just one place and a visual tool makes it easy to create and also iterate on your level shape and these sprite shapes they can also be used to generate platform colliders and also dynamically changed the environment visuals that you see on the screen now when it comes to animating characters sometimes frame by frame animation can be very costly in terms of production time file size and just being difficult to iterate on with a new bone based solution a team needs less arts to achieve smooth animation so here we have this character and she's been created using our new rigging and I K system made entirely for 2d and the characters hurt uses that exact same rigging system but instead driven by 2d physics and here you can see that Jennifer is switching the sprite library asset and this is instantly in real time changing how the character looks all whilst reusing the same 2d rig CDI K and 2d animations this opens up a world of possibilities for developing your game as you can see these new tools and workflows will help you to achieve what you want to create in the most efficient way thank you please welcome Tim Cooper the universal render pipeline is a powerful rendering technology that delivers a combination of beauty and performance right out of the box best of all is supported on any platform that unity can target whether you're building for 2d 3d VR or AR if you wish to develop once and deploy everywhere this is the rendering technology you should be using by using the universal render pipeline you are able to target all of able to use all of our new artist tools and workflows including VFX graph shader graph postprocessing light mapping tools and render passes you can update your projects from unities builtin renderer and simply put it runs better and scales better to demonstrate the benefits of moving to the universal render pipeline we decided to upgrade a real project we took the polygon farm asset store pack by Cynthia Studios and ran it through our automated upgrade tooling in every aspect the universal render pipeline performed better and faster Universal render pipeline utilizes an improved single pass Ford rendering technique that leads to fantastic performance improvements CPU and GPU usage with 30% faster draw calls were significantly reduced and memory access was improved by one third meaning that you can add more content and still hit your target frame rates put simply Universal render pipeline can handle more content it won't heat up your phone as much and your users can play longer now to help me talk about beauty and extensibility andre McGrail will join me so this is crest ocean a tool developed by a small team of true from the UK crest allows you to create beautiful realistic oceans and is built as a plugin for the Universal render pipeline it's available on the asset store now when you think about tropical islands what comes to mind to me it's beautiful inviting emerald green water this phenomenon is caused by the way that bright tropical light scatters and bounces as it interacts with the water is the difficult effect to model accurately utilizing the power of the universal render pipeline the team was able to extend the rendering without having to modify the universal source code and develop a number of stateoftheart rendering features to model this beautiful water you can see on screen right now to start with the team used the custom render pass feature to add shadow accumulation inside the water volume you can see this here in the cave beautiful soft shadows another important part of the Universal render pipeline is the physically based shading model this scales from highend to mobile devices this is an exposed shader library that you can use in your projects for custom materials in crest ocean this was used to help model the stateoftheart subsurface light scattering within the water volume without this the aisle the island looks much less tropical and frankly to me a little dull previously to make effects like this they were hard to achieve but with explicit hooks it's now possible to greatly extend the rendering without having to write a renderer from scratch so Universal gives you beauty and extensibility but what about platform reach keeping with the theme of tropical islands let's take a look at the boat attack project with Universal render path line you can truly author once and deploy everywhere with great performance and bestinclass visuals so let's take a look at this running on the Xbox one we developed the boat attack inhouse as a way to test features for universal as we were developing the pad plan do you want to switch across to the PlayStation 4 Andre we added some cool features to this like a day/night cycle and custom time of day how about you show the people in the crowd and finally let's take a look at this running on the Nintendo switch so what's great about this is this was all built from the same unity project Universal render power plan easily reaches the high end with fantastic performance high resolution and beautiful quality but a project like this how well does it run on mobile here you can see three phones each with different power and capabilities the project you see here is built from the exact same concept content as on the consoles except some features have been optimized through our scalable quality settings on these phones we hit a rocksolid 30 frames per second without sacrificing quality we've also upgraded the postprocessing to a stateoftheart mobile optimized version these effects are designed to work blazingly fast and take advantage of Hardware specific to mobile devices you can easily upgrade your existing projects using our upgrade tooling and start to take advantage of the new features and performance benefits in the 20 19.3 beta if you wish to have gorgeous graphics and be able to scale your content then you need to be using the production ready Universal render pipeline thank you please welcome Freeman Ben since starting multiverse our 40person studio in shenzhen china we've established a reputation for building immersive VR games but our newest project has us applying our unity expertise to PC today I'm thrilled to share an early view at our newest game earth from another Sun in this troika's PS a mysterious threat in the future since earth through a wormhole back to the present day we jumped into production earlier this year leveraging a few unity sample assets to move fast driven by the desire to realize our vision of a graphically stunning game with a new level of immersive realism which was the highdefinition render pipeline HDR P enables us to build a world that feels more lifelike and organic creating an ambience that evokes a sense of tension and mystery to achieve this our artists layered a variety of HDR P effects first we adjusted the exposure then there's some tone mapping applied subsurface scattering add a volumetric lighting modify the color grading and made a slight lens distortion the result speaks for itself a stunning environment that's alive and far more immersive than what we started with even better we didn't have to sacrifice performance every shooter strives for a high frame rate but balancing visual fidelity and performance can be a challenge or overjoyed that earth from another Sun runs at a smooth 60 frames per second even during intense battles while defending against horse of enemies or going up against a giant alien warm performance never stutters or able to achieve our graphical vision while ensuring highly performant gameplay with the highdefinition render pipeline we're benefiting from its incredible visual capabilities while future proofing our development as we head toward a release in 2020 thank you this is the place doesn't look like much go take a look yeah okay here we go so exactly is this guy good kidding there are fairy tales Boston don't be an idiot I see open it wait do it please ask the real this makes no sense to me basta but you might happen to be right you got one shot at this I've got one shot this I know here it is the last one we know that now that's why I'm here please welcome Silvia Rasha Beth and Vlad makeup what you just saw renders in real time 30 frames per second on commercial grade hardware what we like to do now is to give you a behindthescenes peek into what this short film looks like in unity and to share how we address some of the more interesting production and artistic challenges in this project so what we have here is the whole short film from the beginning to the end running in unity in real time we'd like to focus on some of the more interesting points that one allowed us to communicate to you how the team managed to accomplish their vision with our productions we are always striving to achieve a twofold goal on one side we want to push the boundaries on visual fidelity and to get closer to photo realism and on the other we want to enable artistic style ization and visual development that is influenced from cinema we wanted to focus on creating a compelling experience but without getting bogged down with a technically mundane so let us dive right in and first of all show you how unit is high definition render pipeline is used throughout the project it is a feature we've been talking a lot about and here is why it is important the great thing about the HD render pipeline is that it makes highfidelity graphics very accessible you don't need to use any arbitrary measurements and values you can simply emulate what you observe in the real world and you can get the results you expect lighting a scene for example is very intuitive with a range of powerful features such as area lights which are great for shots like this and volumetric lights which contribute a lot to the ambient feel and as Sylvia mentioned because a GRP is using physically accurate values everything else from the camera lens to bloom it just works HDR P also comes builtin with a powerful set of postprocessing tools which allow us to modify the final frame to receive this cinematic look that we desire here you can watch in this shot how it that drastically changes the final look let me emphasize this real quick we are talking about final quality frame which goes directly into the film and that is manipulating it in real time in the editor this is possible due to HDR piece fully unified physically based rendering HTP already comes with some very powerful shaders with which artists can author believable materials these include anything from the standard lead shader to fabric hair or decal shaders however in every project the need for something project specific may arise unity shader graph allows for easy authoring of custom shaders this empowers artists to work independently and to raise the quality of the visuals they create for example here the team is using shader graph to create a dust shader this shader is applied to a material which we've added here to this pipe as you can see wherever I move the pipe that does always settles on top now these kind of effects are really the bread and butter of any kind of production but shader graph enables anybody on the team to create them now on to the character Morgan which appears at the end of the protagonist journey it presented a challenge that we hadn't tackled before it is a creature of undefined shape and gender in a constantly fluctuating emotional state it is distressed and chaotic a being which is both good and evil both male and female both aggressive and vulnerable how do we achieve something like that so we needed a tool that enables us to explore its visual appearance and behavior through fast design iterations we needed not only to render this character in real time but also to author it through a realtime creation process individual effects graph was just the right tool to tackle the challenge of creating a character such as morgan by creating the simulation with GPU particles an artist can change the geometry and the character will basically conform to this new geometry the particles will go and change so this is really powerful because it enables not only to tackle the challenge of Morgan but also to iterate and try out new things and this is how we were able to see Morgan transition between genders transforming from a giant to human size all the while their appearance is shifting in line with their change in emotions one of the most complex problems not only realtime graphics but in CG in general is how to achieve believable human characters the human face is so familiar to us that we have evolved to read and recognize even the tiniest details of its expression in order for a digital human to look acceptable to us a large number of technological features need to be developed and to play nicely together all at once with the production of The Heretic we wanted to explore this space and we wanted to help accelerate unity on a path towards becoming a next level tool for creators no matter how high their ambitions in addition to all standard materials HTTP now ships with building master notes hair fabric and other advanced materials here we are using the builtin hair shader for Gawain stubble and eyebrows and since we are on the topic of hair this is the hair geometry and you can see as Gawain is being animated the geometry conforms to the face and this was possible with the help of csharp jobs and the Birth compiler which allow us to resolve over 400,000 individual frames it is reposes every frame at runtime in addition even though there isn't a dedicated skin shader the team here is extending the stack Lit master noted in HDR P to create a believable skin shader which is applied to go in and you can see as we change the light that the shader reacts as you expect now H TRP and the VFX graph are coming out of preview they are production ready for content creation in unity 20 19.3 you can have it in your hands already today in open beta thank you thank you that's our show I hope you guys had a good time learned a little bit found some interesting tidbits so we believe and hope you agree that realtime 3d is one of the most powerful storytelling mediums of our time and into the future so we hope you guys agree with that so we are going to call it a night for those on the livestream please stick around for the post show with Liz and will it'll start immediately after for all of you in the room here we hope you join us for the racino reception right behind you and thank you have a great week well game development Christmas out there it's not even December even December so many incredible things in that keynote I can't I can't believe it what did you enjoy well my favorite part was I don't mean to be biased but I'm just gonna say um I've really loved the 2d section all our 2d features the demo was gorgeous and I just loved how everything was brought together so we've got so he was using the 2d renderer with the universal render pipeline true sprite shape shader graph use with 2d we had the sprite swap sprite shape just if you all wanting to create a 2d game or project we just have so much great stuff for you is very exciting for me we were talking about this earlier and I love how you know obviously Orion the blind forest came out a while ago now there's Orion the will of the West and that kind of quality of 2d game obviously came from the team with just a ton of passion for making an incredible experience and I just love that we've we've put together those tools that now give you you know lighting and particles and yeah you know complex geometry for 2d it so cool it's just incredible it makes me very happy what about you sorry I was just rambling on it's fine let's talk about you for me it's all about I'm all about the dots and Livelink and bringing all of that stuff to production readiness is a big deal speaking of which so yes this is our opinions but let's have an opinion from someone that might be engineering welcome thank you good see you again it's great to be seen and this is an amazing turnout apologies for the delay but there's a crowd yeah there is a creek did you want ticular highlight this evening in the keynote yeah I mean for me I'm such a sucker for a good story and the demo team just knocks it out of the park every year every time and Heretic was like the most amazing you know story to date and then we only got to see like part one I was like what happens what's in the case what's in the box of I know that was really great but you actually know what's in the box [Laughter] awesome yeah so coming back to it we had lots of dots announcements tonight oh yes that's a big part of where we're going with unity in 2020 how do we approach us about how we approach making sure that dots is something that's ready for people's productions and appropriate for their needs right well like most things with unity you know we have a lot of users out there a lot of great customers building amazing things and when they're building stuff and we know it works then it's great and we can go talk to them how did you make this how'd you make that and we can think about like the solution unity is a solution for say a 2d platformer or a firstperson shooter or something and so when it comes to dots this is really cutting edge stuff right and it's going to unlock a set of experiences that have never before been possible therefore there's nobody out there using that so what we've done is go and use it right yeah unless you can go and use it so you can use dots today you can put it on top of an existing game works great but if you want to go allin on it there is nobody already allin on it because it's brandnew technology so internal productions is what we spin up okay to support that and that's what they what you saw from the sample game team that's right the sample game team made the sample and then what we saw here was was you know the next generation of their of the shooter but using all dots all the pieces all integrated so we know they actually all work together and how we how do we get feedback from that team so that's pretty pivotal right right well they're actually inside of our studios hearing Evan Hagin here in Copenhagen and you know I think over the last couple of years you've seen like a growing number of technical artists and small productions starting to dot around the studios and I think it's really important that we're actually using dogfooding the features was something we heard from our customers we wish we like unique he doesn't make games but gosh we should make games yes as an answer we're pretty much oh now yeah we're pretty much Hornet awesome but we're dealing compute with our customers yeah we never compete with people but we're we're taking all of that feedback from the internal production and making it real awesome thank you so much for joining us thanks for so much being here and you know earlier when we were chatting you were asking me about what we're like most excited about in 2020 oh yes yeah I'm most excited about a strong growing investment in artists to lean in workflows I know when unity was invented a few kilometers from here it was 90 percent programmers 10 percent artists nowadays it's completely opposite so you know starting in the few months remaining this year but on into next year this internal production idea of getting more artists more teams more people building inside of unity and making sure that artists around the world creators a little kinds of the best tools and workflows that's what that's what I'm excited about that's what we're investing the same thank you we're gonna grab some some even more guests so we'll see you at the show thank you amazing so so a lot in Aquino it's true lots of bases to cover lovely guests for you next up is my hero director of XR at Unity Timoney so yes in the keynote lots of awesome information yes is there anything that you just wanted to drill down more into and be like I need to tell the people this yes absolutely and I mean I feel like our section could have been in your keynote to really dive into it can't believe you didn't so the one thing I really want to talk about is the interaction toolkit which is new that's Matt Albie's team on the platforms team and it is is such a fantastic addition to the way you author for this new era of sensor driven computers because when it comes to how computers work today the traditional inputs that we think about are not the only way you work anymore you can open your laptop with your face right but it's true you're now your face is an input right you're your hands can be an input your voice can be an input there's all these new ways of interacting and especially when it comes to the sort of development kits for the wearable AR devices these are expensive they're hard to get not only would developer has access to them so the toolkit actually provides this base layer I have interactivity where the developer can just think to themselves I need to select this object here like I need my character to be able to do it or I need my user to be able to do it provide this layer of you know it's just a selection and then handle it across all the different types of inputs and all the different types of devices that you might need to use and that's fantastic that's really opening up to so many developers right just across the yes absolutely absolutely it's also kind of like future proofing as well exactly yeah so how we understand so you we have obviously there's a are cat nail core then on top of that you have obviously unity and you have so the core audience for Mars when we started building it we really were laser focused on augmented reality developers today they are kitten core so the phones and then also the wearable devices but the cool thing that we have found out as we have built out this tool is that when it comes to augmented reality it's it's not just about the devices themselves it's about the types of data that you get in and again it's the gesture recognition it's the voice recognition it's the room mesh scan information and the object detection and so on and so what we've just we found is the workflows that we've created for these headsets and these phones actually works for all types of sort of world wear devices like selfdriving cars or smart speakers so it actually opens up unity for a wider swath of different types of applications and devices working together than we had expected and that is so exciting we didn't either until we started to think about it more and we're like wait a minute awesome so where can people learn more about Mars yes we have a landing page where you can sign up for the closed beta we're taking people as they come in on a case by case basis just to make sure that we provide the proper support you get a technical onboarding and access to the package we're also have a blog post coming out I think on the next week that will give an update on the status and that will be more to come obviously next year cool thank you thank you have a check and finally last but not least not least is VP of AI and machine learning hello you showed some crazy things I'm someone who doesn't know about that area of the business that much so it's really exciting for me to you understand this insight into what you're working on and the application of it like what was it eleven billion miles before a selfdriving car is certified as safe yeah and just how so she's just just sitting here you need to go out and get going on it's never gonna happen yeah oh you just simulate it all yeah and I do so apart from that which is incredible in itself what other applications of simulation could there be unfortunately many that's why we launched the service of course there's the whole gaming business of play testing you talked about selfdriving cars yeah but we're also now seeing that robots are coming out of the cages yeah you've seen those robots in in car manufacturing yeah I've seen Boston Dynamics getting out and moving around yeah yeah you can't program those things yeah they just meet so many situations all the time yeah so what you have to do is you have to simulate a massive scale so you're providing the human behavior simulated for them to learn how to respond exactly people are gonna interact with these robots so what do we do we use the NPC's in unity we import the robots virtually into unity and then we let the NPC's interact with robots and the robots will learn there are certain things you shouldn't do we can hope opportunity for unity to use the game technology and all the staff that the game developers have sort of created over the years the skills the techniques and then use them to impact the real world yes amazing so going back to gaming then what are the implications of using this in in the gaming yeah I think about it this way games were getting more and more dynamic more and more adaptive yeah so you want to finetune your games you want to figure out how your games are gonna work when they're to meet the real audience the real human so what do you do you simulate you run butts against your game and see how it performs the different types of robotic players yeah it's basically NPCs playing the game so you're thinking about like you know procedural games where you know creating encounters and having you know teams of thousands of game designers isn't really an option but you know using simulation to create those encounters yes exactly and you can figure out how they work before you bring it bring them into the wild into into the market so simulations gonna change a lot of lying yes amazing yeah and where can people learn more about unity simulation is this earth so go to a website it's linked there you can sign up and you can join the beta get your things rolling Wow okay yeah engage these robots [Laughter] well Elizabeth it has come to an end but really it's only just getting started so you can join unite Copenhagen from home by just looking on any social Channel for a hashtag unite Copenhagen we're gonna be sharing stuff internally or everyone who's here three thousand people who are here are going to be joining and sharing stuff with you so make sure to look out for it there you can join our YouTube channel yep many of the talks from this week are going to be released on to our youtube channel in the coming weeks so please keep your eyes peeled for that but until then we will see you and I mean you specifically at GDC thanks for watching everyone okay good night you
