00:00 - since the launch of unity's UI features
00:01 - in 4.6 one area that has really been
00:04 - lagging is text luckily one of my
00:06 - favorite editor extensions text mesh pro
00:08 - has now been acquired by unity and so we
00:10 - should see this slowly be made of the
00:12 - unity standard editor until then text
00:14 - mesh Pro is available for free on the
00:16 - asset store and if you haven't picked it
00:17 - up yet well you're really missing out
00:19 - the asset uses say technique called sign
00:20 - distance field to make your text render
00:22 - so much crisper it also has a bunch of
00:24 - tools for layouting your text and lots
00:26 - of cool buttons for styling it so in
00:28 - this video we'll just dive in and start
00:29 - using some of these features let's get
00:31 - into it the most important part for me
00:32 - is how crisp the text renders here we
00:34 - see a comparison between the standard
00:36 - text and unity and a text mesh Pro text
00:38 - object I hope this is clear from the
00:40 - recording but even at this distance
00:42 - there's a huge difference and if we now
00:44 - go to the scene View and start zooming
00:46 - in the difference becomes so much
00:48 - clearer in fact we can keep zooming in
00:50 - on the text mesh Pro object and it will
00:53 - remain crisp well if we do this on Unity
00:55 - standard text not so much so to get text
00:58 - mesh Pro we want to go window asset
01:01 - store and then search for text mesh Pro
01:04 - you can just use the link in the
01:05 - description we'll then import it for
01:07 - free let's hit import again and that's
01:09 - it now we're ready to get started
01:11 - creating text in text mesh Pro works in
01:13 - the same way that it normally does we'll
01:15 - simply right click in the hierarchy go
01:16 - UI and instead of choosing text we'll
01:19 - choose text mesh Pro text as you can see
01:21 - this creates a canvas and our text mesh
01:23 - Pro object and we can configure it in
01:25 - the inspector we can choose the text
01:27 - itself we can also scale up our box here
01:30 - and choose how it should be layouted in
01:32 - it we can choose a font by changing the
01:34 - font asset you should get a few ones by
01:37 - default we can choose some styling
01:39 - options and if you go to material preset
01:41 - there are some pre-made styles to choose
01:43 - from but before we delve into styling
01:45 - let's have a look at importing our own
01:46 - fonts to do that we first want to find a
01:48 - font I'm just going to search for
01:50 - robotto this is on Google fonts I'm
01:52 - going to select this font I'm then going
01:54 - to take the font family and download it
01:57 - finally you can open this up in a zip
01:59 - file make sure to extract the zip file
02:01 - and let's now take robot regular.ttf and
02:04 - simply drag it into the unity project
02:07 - now this is a regular font and so this
02:09 - is not going to render in the crisp way
02:10 - that text mesh Pro does to make this
02:12 - usable for text mesh Pro we go window
02:15 - text smash Pro and we open up the font
02:18 - as a Creator this allows us to take a
02:20 - regular font we'll take in our newly
02:22 - imported font and drag it into the font
02:24 - sour slot and turn it into a font Adas
02:26 - using sign distance field in most cases
02:29 - you can leave all the settings as is and
02:30 - hit generate font Atlas and it should
02:32 - look something like this now we can hit
02:35 - save textmesh Pro font asset you can
02:37 - choose a location in your project and
02:39 - I'm just going to call it
02:41 - robot. asset let's now hit save we can
02:44 - close down the fond asset Creator and
02:45 - boom we now have a font asset we then
02:48 - select our text mesh Pro object drag in
02:50 - our new font asset and there we go we've
02:52 - now changed the font of our text now if
02:55 - we scroll down in the inspector we can
02:56 - see all of the different knots and dials
02:58 - that will allow us to style text in most
03:01 - cases however you just want fairly
03:02 - simple text controls and we don't want
03:04 - to spend performance and all these
03:06 - options that we won't use so we go to
03:08 - Shader and change this to text mesh Pro
03:10 - mobile and then distance field this only
03:13 - has options for the face outline and an
03:16 - underlay such as a shadow so to add a
03:18 - shadow to a text we enable our underlay
03:21 - let's open up the settings let's offset
03:23 - it on the X and Y and let's add some
03:26 - softness and there we go we've now
03:28 - created white text with a black shadow
03:31 - but that's so much more we can do if you
03:33 - go on the text mesh Pro folder on
03:35 - examples then scenes there are almost 30
03:38 - different scenes here showing different
03:40 - aspects of text mesh Pro I really
03:42 - recommend going through all of these
03:44 - each feature can be super useful let's
03:46 - try open up number 25 the text mesh Pro
03:48 - title and I'll just hit don't save now
03:51 - you can see some text working with
03:52 - lighting if we go ahead and disable one
03:54 - of the lights our text will update let's
03:57 - select the two text objects here and
03:58 - disable them and let's let create one on
04:00 - our own by right clicking going 3D
04:02 - object and selecting text mesh Pro text
04:05 - let's then find it in the scene view
04:07 - let's drag it up a bit and let's change
04:09 - the font asset to our robotto text
04:11 - however this styling is super boring but
04:14 - instead of overwriting our current style
04:16 - let's go ahead and create a new one this
04:18 - option can be a bit hard to find but
04:20 - what we need to do is actually right
04:21 - click on our material down here hit
04:24 - create material preset this is going to
04:26 - take us to the place where our font
04:28 - asset is stored and create a material
04:30 - right by the side of it the default
04:32 - material the first one we're using right
04:34 - now can be found under the fond asset
04:37 - itself so let's name our new material
04:39 - robotto let's call it coal let's then
04:42 - select our text object make sure our
04:44 - robotto coal material is selected and
04:46 - let's switch out of this mobile Shader
04:48 - to text mesh Pro and let's do distance
04:50 - field surface now you can see that the
04:52 - lighting our scene is already affecting
04:54 - our text so if we change the lighting
04:56 - our text will change with it let's make
04:58 - our text bold let's give it a bit more
05:00 - room let's Center it in our text box
05:03 - make sure to move it over to center it
05:05 - in our game view let's also add some
05:07 - spacing between the characters let's
05:09 - scroll down for our face let's dilate
05:12 - the text a bit and here we can of course
05:13 - choose a color but we can also put a
05:16 - texture so that's hit select and when
05:18 - importing text mesh Pro it's also going
05:20 - to import some materials I'm going to
05:22 - take the floor cement and I'm also going
05:24 - to add some gloss this is not going to
05:26 - change however before we go down here
05:28 - and on the lighting increase our
05:30 - specular color and now you can see that
05:32 - we're adding in gloss on our text let's
05:35 - then create an outline to do that we'll
05:37 - increase the thickness let's add some
05:39 - gloss here as well let's select a white
05:42 - color and we have the option to add a
05:44 - texture here as well for this one I'm
05:46 - going to select the fruit jelly and we
05:48 - can maybe tint this a bit let's say
05:51 - orange or maybe a bluish tone now we can
05:54 - adjust a bevel we can play around with
05:56 - the offset with the width the amount and
05:59 - we can even kind of round it out let's
06:01 - also add a bump map to our text under
06:04 - the texture here let's select sand
06:06 - normal and let's make this really
06:08 - apparent on the face and also give it a
06:11 - tiny bit on the outline finally there
06:13 - are options for adding environment Maps
06:15 - if you want Reflections and even glow to
06:18 - your text I think I'm going to add an
06:20 - RNG glow now this does not look good but
06:23 - I'm sure that's more the artist than the
06:25 - toll from here on I recommend you check
06:27 - out some of the example scenes if you
06:29 - get lost on your particular setting
06:30 - there's also the user guide and in the
06:32 - description you will also see a link to
06:34 - a YouTube channel by the guy who made
06:36 - this asset there's a lot of in-depth
06:38 - information there so really there's no
06:40 - excuse to not have fun with this that's
06:41 - pretty much it for this video If you
06:43 - enjoyed it make sure to subscribe so you
