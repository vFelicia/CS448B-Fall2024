00:00 - a central part of video games is combat
00:02 - whether you're killing
00:03 - computer-controlled zombies in left 4
00:04 - dead or doing PvP in DotA combat can be
00:07 - both exhilarating and fun now what makes
00:10 - something fun can be a hard thing to
00:11 - grasp everything came across a great
00:13 - article by mag Birkhead which tries to
00:15 - break this down so according to mic
00:17 - player actions in combat is made up of
00:19 - three steps first step is to form a goal
00:21 - you then choose an intention which means
00:23 - how you want to achieve this goal and
00:25 - last you generate the sequence of
00:26 - actions needed to realize the intention
00:29 - so let's say your goal is to kill your
00:30 - opponent your intention could then be to
00:32 - use your sword to kill him and the
00:34 - action sequence could be to pull out
00:35 - your sword walk up to your opponent and
00:37 - hit a tag a bunch of times now this
00:39 - example might seem obvious and if all
00:41 - combat in a game played out using these
00:43 - exact steps it would quickly become
00:44 - repetitive and boring so what do you do
00:47 - to make this more interesting is provide
00:49 - the player with multiple valid
00:50 - intentions if the player has multiple
00:52 - ways of solving a problem and reaching a
00:54 - goal they will start to feel that the
00:56 - game has more depth but providing the
00:58 - player with more options is not enough
01:00 - in itself just filling up your games
01:01 - with empty mechanics will make it feel
01:03 - bloated and tedious now this is where
01:05 - constraints come in constraints are used
01:07 - to strategically limit the amount of
01:09 - valid intentions that player has in a
01:11 - given situation in other words we are
01:12 - making different intentions more likely
01:14 - of success based on three types of
01:16 - constraints the goal the environment and
01:18 - the opponent let's have a look at an
01:20 - example where these constraints play in
01:22 - so if you ever played what the four
01:23 - craft you probably know that the Warlock
01:25 - class used to be provided with a large
01:27 - number of spells in general this could
01:29 - be split up into two major intentions
01:31 - you could choose to focus on the damage
01:33 - over time spells or you could focus on
01:35 - the direct damage spells what intention
01:37 - gave the best outcome completely
01:38 - depended on the constraints if you are
01:40 - facing a warrior the best way to avoid
01:42 - dying was to keep a good distance here
01:44 - could use the insta casts damage over
01:46 - time spells while running away and
01:47 - making sure to stay out of melee range
01:49 - eventually the warrior would run out of
01:51 - health and you could start spamming an
01:52 - insult of your choosing if you are
01:54 - facing a major on the other hand you had
01:56 - to use a completely different tactic
01:57 - which meant changing your intention here
02:00 - the damage over time spells weren't
02:01 - nearly as effective because the mage had
02:03 - the ability to remove them instead it
02:05 - was more effective to burst him down
02:07 - using the heavy hitting direct damage
02:09 - spells this is a good example of where
02:10 - the type of opponent you're dealing
02:12 - changes the intention but there are
02:13 - other factors that play a big role in
02:15 - what intention to choose so råsunda
02:17 - facing worry was standing above him on a
02:19 - Ledge now we're dealing with an
02:21 - environmental context here could freely
02:23 - cast your direct damage spells without
02:25 - any fear of the warrior getting close
02:26 - and what the major isn't bothered by you
02:29 - standing on the ledge environment still
02:30 - plays a big role here because the
02:32 - warlock has a lot of instant cast
02:34 - abilities it makes it easy to pop out
02:36 - use a bunch of abilities and go back to
02:38 - hiding this makes it really hard for a
02:40 - mage to hit you in terrain with many
02:41 - obstacles because he has to worry about
02:43 - line of sight on his slow casting
02:45 - abilities now that got a bit technical
02:46 - but I think it's a great example of how
02:48 - you have to consider both your opponent
02:50 - and the environment in order to choose
02:52 - the correct strategy what's great about
02:53 - combat that takes this into
02:54 - consideration is that it rewards
02:56 - experienced players because of their
02:57 - ability to make calculated decisions of
03:00 - course when you add this type of
03:01 - complexity to a game it can be hard for
03:03 - new players to get started because they
03:05 - simply don't have the knowledge of all
03:06 - the classes and abilities that go into
03:08 - choosing the right intention I consider
03:10 - this both a weakness and a strength of
03:12 - many modern date games especially games
03:14 - like dota or League of Legends are known
03:16 - for being notoriously hard to learn this
03:18 - can make it extremely frustrating for
03:20 - new players trying to learn the game but
03:22 - also really rewarding for the more
03:23 - experienced players but we also see
03:25 - newer games that go in the opposite
03:27 - direction instead for writing depth by
03:29 - adding more opponent types and abilities
03:32 - these games may come at interesting by
03:33 - focusing on the coal or environment a
03:36 - good example of this is rocket League of
03:38 - course the overall goal is simple you
03:40 - want to score as many goals on your
03:41 - opponent as possible without them
03:43 - scoring on you but depending on the
03:45 - placement of the players in the
03:46 - environment your goal and intentions
03:48 - change drastically or any of your allies
03:50 - close to you what is the placement of
03:52 - your opponents where are you in relation
03:54 - to the ball these are just a few
03:56 - examples of questions you need to ask
03:57 - about the environment before you can
03:59 - decide on a goal and how to accomplish
04:00 - it but rocket League also uses a
04:02 - particular element really well I'm
04:04 - talking about urgency because the game
04:06 - is so centered around being at the right
04:08 - place at the right time speed becomes
04:10 - very important some goals might not be
04:12 - very urgent like getting in position for
04:13 - a good defense and allow you to pick up
04:15 - boost along the way though a lot of the
04:17 - time situations are very urgent so if
04:19 - you're racing to get in position to
04:21 - convert a good pass in to scoring a goal
04:23 - so with this in mind we also have to
04:25 - take in consideration
04:26 - like what speed is the ball traveling at
04:28 - and in what direction and do you have
04:30 - enough boost to make it in time in
04:31 - general shooters take good use of the
04:33 - environment to add constraints if you
04:35 - think your opponent is waiting for you
04:36 - around a corner you might decide to
04:38 - throw a flashbang before running out and
04:39 - shooting him if you know a sniper is
04:41 - lying in wait you probably want to stay
04:42 - away from open areas and stay largely
04:44 - hidden behind cover
04:46 - I find that analyzing games in this way
04:48 - can really help narrow down what's
04:50 - important when designing combat for
04:51 - games within a particular genre it's
04:53 - definitely something that I'll keep in
04:55 - mind next time I'm laying out a level or
04:56 - adding a new ability to one of my own
04:58 - games so if this video gave you some
04:59 - ideas on how you can make combat fun in
05:01 - your games feel free to share your own
05:03 - ideas on the subject in the comments of
05:04 - course this video is a bit unusual in
05:06 - that it focuses on game design instead
05:09 - of the more technical side definitely
05:10 - let me know if you like this format and
05:12 - if there's anything I could do to
05:13 - improve it on that thanks watching and I
