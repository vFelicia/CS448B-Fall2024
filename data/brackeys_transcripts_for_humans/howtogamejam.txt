00:00 - now it's no secret that I like game
00:01 - development a lot but there's definitely
00:04 - one thing that stands out to me as my
00:06 - favorite part that is of course game
00:10 - jams over the years I've participated in
00:13 - Ludum dare a 5 times and we've hosted
00:15 - several practice game jams we're also
00:17 - joined in on the fun
00:18 - in total I've made over 10 game jam
00:21 - games and each one has been a unique and
00:23 - fun experience but in between all the
00:26 - fun I've also made a lot of mistakes so
00:30 - today I'll share a few tips on what to
00:32 - do before during and after a game jam so
00:35 - that you can hopefully avoid some of the
00:37 - pitfalls that I fell into now keep in
00:40 - mind that when it comes to game jams
00:41 - there's no greater advice than to
00:43 - remember to just have fun game jams all
00:45 - about having a good time and at the same
00:47 - time improving your skills so if you
00:49 - just remember that you'll probably be
00:51 - fine
00:51 - oh and also make sure to play test
00:53 - that's it let's jump into it but first
00:56 - this video is sponsored by core course
00:58 - the new free game creation platform that
01:00 - lets you build publish and play games
01:01 - car makes prototyping and iteration fast
01:04 - so it's a great platform for game jams
01:06 - especially if you want to quickly set up
01:08 - a 3d multiplayer experience you can get
01:11 - started making games right away using
01:13 - thousands of free high-quality music
01:15 - sound and art assets with no coding
01:17 - required right now course hosting the
01:19 - kind of funny game jam with Greg Miller
01:21 - supporting the charity Extra Life and
01:23 - starting to and first the International
01:25 - Game Developers Association will be
01:27 - hosting a Koi focused game jam be sure
01:29 - to check them out using the link in the
01:30 - description on top of that they recently
01:32 - launched Kor Academy which is a free
01:34 - online school for learning development
01:36 - skills that also gives you the
01:38 - opportunity to interact with industry
01:40 - pros for live mentorship everything is
01:42 - completely free so I definitely
01:43 - encourage you to visit Kor Gamescom or
01:46 - simply click the link in the description
01:47 - so a game jam is coming up and you're
01:49 - just so excited to get started if you
01:51 - could you would start right now
01:53 - and you can kind of there are lots of
01:57 - stuff that you can do before a game jam
01:59 - first of all you have to decide if
02:00 - you're teaming up or going solo and do
02:03 - yourself a favor and decide well in
02:05 - advance since the communication over
02:07 - forums and discord channels can take
02:09 - some time now teaming up can be really
02:11 - fun and getting to work together with
02:13 - the people on something creative is an
02:15 - amazing experience most game gems offer
02:18 - a place that you can go in order to find
02:19 - people to team up with or can always
02:21 - join our discord which is filled with
02:24 - fellow game dreamers personally I
02:25 - usually go solo
02:26 - but we always invite people over to jam
02:29 - along which just makes the experience so
02:31 - much more fun plus you always have
02:32 - someone nearby to play test your game
02:35 - another thing that I usually do before a
02:37 - game jam starts is make a list of all
02:39 - the things and tools that I'm going to
02:40 - need during the jam I mean that's
02:42 - nothing more frustrating than having to
02:44 - wait for a download because she recently
02:46 - reinstalled your computer and forgot to
02:48 - download unity not like that ever
02:50 - happened to me anyway you guys probably
02:52 - want to remember to download and update
02:54 - everything you need so here's a quick
02:56 - list of everything I use for the game
02:58 - engine I personally use unity since it's
03:00 - the one that I'm most familiar with but
03:02 - feel free to pick any of the other
03:04 - amazing engines out there also remember
03:06 - that you don't always have to create a
03:07 - video game board and card games also
03:09 - viable options in many jams of course
03:12 - other than the engine you are probably
03:14 - also going to need some tools to create
03:15 - graphics and audio I personally use
03:18 - blender for modeling Photoshop for 2d
03:20 - graphics and puskás I and audition for
03:22 - audio of course some of these are paid
03:25 - so here are some free alternatives to
03:27 - those of you interested and if you're
03:30 - working as a team make sure to set up
03:32 - file-sharing and voice chat beforehand
03:35 - especially if you're working online here
03:37 - are some of the tools that I personally
03:38 - use for that and talking about tools
03:43 - don't forget the good old pen and paper
03:46 - this one does need an update it's always
03:49 - ready to go so finally the day has
03:52 - arrived and the jam has started and the
03:55 - theme is amazing but where do you start
03:58 - well the first thing that I do is play
04:00 - test all right maybe not yet but don't
04:03 - forget it what I actually do is start
04:05 - brainstorming right away this is all
04:07 - about getting as many ideas on the table
04:09 - as possible even the most crazy out of
04:11 - scope ones you can always turn those
04:13 - down later but sometimes I get stuck on
04:15 - brainstorming for a long time
04:17 - mostly because I start doubting if my
04:19 - ideas are good enough however over the
04:21 - years I've learned that your first idea
04:23 - is often the best one so if you get
04:25 - stuck
04:26 - maybe just roll with that with that said
04:29 - however definitely spent some time in
04:30 - the brainstorming phase since you can
04:32 - often pull some of your other ideas into
04:34 - your game later on and don't worry too
04:37 - much about originality you're not
04:38 - creating a commercial game so who cares
04:40 - if it's a ripoff sometimes I find it's
04:43 - really fun to challenge myself with
04:44 - recreating some of my favorite games and
04:47 - if you can put a twist on it even better
04:49 - remember game jams are all about
04:51 - learning and one of the best ways to do
04:53 - that is by challenging yourself with
04:54 - creating a game mechanic or genre that
04:57 - you've never done before
04:58 - now once the core idea is in place I
05:01 - often take some time to plan out exactly
05:02 - what I want in the game
05:04 - okay it's a good idea to keep in mind
05:05 - how much time you're actually going to
05:07 - have for the gem is this a two-day jam
05:09 - or a two-week jam and no matter the time
05:12 - frame
05:13 - make sure to limit your scope after I
05:16 - think up some cool gameplay ideas with
05:18 - tons of systems and mechanics I divide
05:21 - them by two or maybe twenty I've ended
05:24 - up with over the ambitious ideas
05:26 - countless of times and I found that it's
05:28 - way more satisfying to actually complete
05:30 - a simple game than barely making a
05:32 - playable demo of some advanced mechanic
05:35 - so start small you can always add stuff
05:37 - later on I found that a good technique
05:39 - for making sure that I don't bite off
05:41 - more than I can chew is the Moscow
05:43 - method with this you can make a list of
05:44 - all the features you want in your game
05:46 - mechanics graphics audio and so on and
05:49 - then divide them into four categories
05:51 - must have the game needs this to
05:53 - function should have this is big parts
05:56 - of the game but not the actual core
05:58 - could have stuff to add if you have the
06:00 - time and one tab cool things but you
06:03 - probably won't have time to add them
06:04 - that's it don't spend all day on
06:06 - planning after all this list will
06:08 - probably be updated along the way if
06:10 - you're short on time you can always move
06:12 - some of the things from could have to
06:13 - one half it's most important to just get
06:15 - started
06:16 - and don't forget to play test and this
06:18 - is the point where I usually put up
06:20 - unity and where everything kind of
06:22 - starts to become a messy blur of
06:23 - programming bug fixing and pretending to
06:26 - know what I'm doing making pixel art I
06:28 - quickly lose sense of time while jamming
06:30 - which means that I often forget about
06:32 - basic stuff like eating or drinking so I
06:35 - started setting timers to make sure that
06:37 - I don't work too much and still function
06:39 - like a gnome
06:39 - human being perhaps with a bit more
06:42 - energy drink also when I seem to be
06:44 - facing a problem that just defies the
06:46 - laws of the universe it's probably
06:49 - because I've been working too long and
06:50 - need to take a break as soon as I take a
06:52 - walk or just do something else a
06:54 - solution normally pops up and even if it
06:56 - doesn't you still return to the problem
06:58 - with renewed energy oh and while taking
07:01 - a break of course make sure to have my
07:02 - friends play test now nearing the end of
07:05 - the jam hours and maybe days have passed
07:07 - you've struggled and it's time to finish
07:09 - up the game everything probably isn't as
07:11 - you hoped it would be but hey you made
07:13 - something in very little time and it's
07:16 - not meant to be perfect plus there are
07:18 - often a bunch of things in the game that
07:20 - are really cool that you would have
07:21 - never planned to make at this point I
07:23 - used the last bit of time to do some
07:24 - important polishing and make sure not to
07:26 - neglect audio and UI at least that's
07:28 - what I tell myself when I go to bed at
07:30 - night and when you're finally done make
07:33 - sure to leave an hour to get everything
07:34 - exported and submitted and be happy and
07:37 - remember game jams aren't about the game
07:39 - itself it's about the process and
07:42 - everything that you just learned in a
07:43 - few days plus you might even have made
07:45 - some new friends along the way just
07:47 - think about it you got to experience
07:49 - every part of the game development
07:50 - process in mini format everything from
07:53 - idea generation to polishing in the end
07:56 - so congratulations you are finally done
07:58 - now it's time to celebrate and rest and
08:01 - maybe play some of the entries from your
08:03 - fellow community members remember this
08:05 - is a guide and not the definitive best
08:07 - way to do a game jam everyone is
08:09 - different and have different workflows
08:11 - with that said I wish you the best of
08:13 - luck and lots of great inspiration for
08:15 - your next Jam and of course hope to see
