00:00 - so do you need unity Pro nope thanks of
00:03 - the awesome patron alright maybe the
00:05 - answer is a bit more complicated than
00:06 - that let's try and break it down also
00:08 - thanks to hands off tuned for his
00:09 - support on patron now let's get into the
00:12 - free version of unity unity personal
00:13 - includes all engine features this means
00:16 - that you have access to all
00:17 - functionality within the editor in
00:19 - previous versions of unity a lot of
00:21 - features like real-time shadows render
00:23 - textures and the profiler were not part
00:25 - of the free version in fact you have to
00:27 - purchase separate licenses in order to
00:29 - publish for mobile but as of mid 2016
00:32 - all engine features and platforms are
00:34 - freely available so why would you need
00:36 - to pay for a subscription
00:37 - well unity now offers to paid price
00:39 - tiers plus and pro unity plus gives you
00:43 - the ability to customize the splash
00:45 - screen this means that you can put your
00:47 - own logo instead of the unity logo at
00:49 - the start of your game you also get
00:51 - access to performance reporting which
00:53 - automatically collects errors across all
00:55 - platforms and devices which means that
00:57 - you can quickly find an address issues
00:59 - this is cool because it can be used to
01:01 - solve bugs after release and then of
01:03 - course there's unity teens unity teams
01:06 - is a set of features that makes it
01:07 - easier for multiple people to work
01:09 - together on a project both collaborate
01:11 - and cloud build are part of unity teams
01:14 - that means that you sync your project to
01:15 - the cloud and other team members can
01:17 - make changes and publish them from
01:19 - within the editor when a change is made
01:21 - unity will then automatically create
01:23 - builds for the desired platforms and
01:24 - send them to all team members this can
01:27 - be a huge time saver because you no
01:28 - longer have to worry about version
01:30 - control and it pretty much eliminates
01:32 - time spent waiting on builds as of
01:34 - making this video unity teams is free
01:36 - for everyone but that unfortunately ends
01:38 - this October from there on out unity
01:40 - teams can be bought as part of unity
01:42 - plus or as a separate subscription but
01:45 - splash screens and collaboration aside
01:46 - we all know the real reason for buying
01:48 - unity the dark editor skin no and when
01:51 - it comes to unity Pro you get all the
01:52 - same features as with plus but with some
01:55 - added extras most of it however is
01:57 - fairly minor to regular indie developers
01:59 - if you're making a multiplayer game
02:00 - unity Pro will allow you to have more
02:02 - concurrent users but really the main
02:04 - reason for picking up unity Pro is that
02:06 - it has no limit on annual revenue
02:09 - remember that unity personal is only
02:10 - available to studios who generate less
02:13 - than $100,000 a year and during the plus
02:16 - 4 studios that generate less than
02:17 - 200,000 again this mostly applies to
02:19 - well-established studios but it's
02:21 - definitely good to keep in mind so now
02:22 - that we know the difference between the
02:24 - different versions which one should you
02:26 - pick well that totally depends in my
02:29 - opinion if you're a new developer
02:30 - working on your own there's no problem
02:32 - in using the free version it has all the
02:34 - core engine features and some of the
02:36 - cloud stuff to make your life a little
02:37 - bit easier so you can definitely make
02:39 - and publish some great games using unity
02:41 - personal of course you will have to live
02:43 - with the light editor skin when it comes
02:45 - to your new Pro I think it's way
02:47 - overkill for small indie Studios
02:48 - especially one that's just starting out
02:51 - however if you're serious about making
02:52 - games for living especially if you're
02:54 - working with multiple people picking up
02:55 - unity plus can speed up development
02:57 - quite a bit oh and I almost forgot if
02:59 - you subscribe to unity plus or pro
03:01 - you'll now get a free essentials pack
03:04 - this is actually a really nice selling
03:06 - point because some of the tools like the
03:07 - uber standard shader and final ik'
03:10 - are really nice tools in their own right
03:12 - so whether you want to get Unity
03:14 - personal plus or pro you can click the
03:16 - link in the description to be taken to
03:18 - the website in the end the choice is
03:20 - totally up to you and feel free to join
