00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - this exclusive interview with the guy
00:08 - behind 31 games in 31 days he's called
00:11 - Victor AKA zein captain and he's just
00:15 - made his own Block featuring the 31
00:18 - games so welcome to you Victor tell us
00:21 - how long have you been making games
00:23 - hello well uh I've been making games for
00:27 - uh about 6 years and I've been making
00:30 - most of them in game maker just small
00:33 - games in my spare time um and after well
00:38 - I at some point I wanted to move on from
00:41 - game maker and so I made some I started
00:44 - learning Flash and using action script
00:48 - and at some point I put uh flexel in
00:52 - there to use as a
00:54 - library um and I also took halfe class
00:58 - in Java
01:00 - programming but I've never actually made
01:03 - any games in that uh since I decided to
01:06 - move back to game maker after trying out
01:08 - Java cool so you you've been making
01:10 - games for quite some time um this
01:14 - project you've started it's it's really
01:16 - interesting to me the nature of it could
01:18 - you tell us more on how you came up with
01:20 - the concept like the reasoning behind um
01:23 - the idea well half a year ago I tried
01:27 - out uh how fast I could make games in
01:30 - game maker and I tried doing these uh
01:33 - games which I called 15 minutes project
01:36 - uh where I made a few games something
01:39 - like uh seven games and so I realized
01:44 - that it was actually possible for me to
01:47 - make one of these very quick games uh I
01:50 - could actually make one of those every
01:52 - single day and so because I wanted the
01:56 - practice and because I wanted uh to try
02:00 - out if I liked making games for a long
02:03 - time so at the end of September I kind
02:06 - of just decided out of nowhere that now
02:10 - was the time uh for me to try making
02:14 - games for a full month and see if I
02:16 - could actually finish this uh idea of
02:19 - mine turns out you could um but maybe
02:22 - you could elaborate on your experience
02:25 - with game maker um as a tool like the
02:28 - goods and the bads did you ever meet any
02:30 - limitations throughout when making these
02:32 - games well the main good thing about
02:35 - game maker is how easy it is to use and
02:38 - how quick it is to use which was of
02:41 - course perfect for this project because
02:45 - I could make games in a very short time
02:48 - and still have quite a bit of
02:50 - functionality in them the uh bad things
02:54 - about game maker are mainly its
02:57 - limitations in that it is very bad at
03:01 - making 3D games for example so if I
03:04 - wanted to make a 3D game I would
03:06 - probably start learning Unity but for
03:08 - this purpose and for most 2D games I
03:12 - think uh it is uh game maker is quite
03:15 - enough definitely agree with you um to
03:18 - those of you out there who thinks that
03:20 - Unity can be quite the challenge game
03:23 - maker is a great free tool unless you
03:26 - want to publish to extreme platforms
03:28 - like mobile and and so on one thing that
03:31 - fascinates me is how you just how you're
03:34 - just able to sit down and so yourself
03:37 - force yourself actually to come up with
03:39 - some kind of idea some kind of mechanic
03:42 - that just works and um maybe you could
03:44 - give me some inside on how what do you
03:48 - think when you sit down to make this
03:50 - game how do you brainstorm the mechanics
03:53 - and from there start building the game
03:55 - the way I do it is that I make sure that
03:58 - I have some time where I won't get
04:00 - interrupted and where I have time to be
04:03 - alone and I sit down and I start
04:07 - thinking sometimes I put on some music
04:10 - um which helps uh often but I sit down
04:14 - and then I I start thinking about these
04:17 - very uh AB abstract things like um
04:22 - abstract things interacting with each
04:24 - other like uh big buildings growing out
04:28 - of walls and big circles hitting them
04:32 - and I just let my brain uh go wild with
04:37 - everything that I can think of and then
04:40 - at some point if I think of something
04:42 - that I think is
04:43 - interesting I kind of try to condense
04:47 - that into something that that I could
04:51 - make in game maker uh into a mechanic uh
04:55 - that could work then when I have that
04:58 - mechanic I
05:00 - I can pretty quickly tell from
05:02 - experience if it will be any fun and if
05:07 - I will actually be able to make it if
05:09 - it's uh if it doesn't meet these two
05:11 - criteria I scrap it immediately and I
05:13 - try to think of something new but when I
05:17 - then when when I have something that has
05:19 - passed these two uh main
05:22 - criteria I then start thinking about uh
05:26 - a goal for this mechanic because often
05:29 - I'll have uh thought of something like
05:31 - like an interesting way to move around
05:34 - um but then I I because I want to make
05:37 - games and not just uh funny ways of
05:40 - moving around I I then try to think of a
05:44 - goal for this and uh something that that
05:48 - you can do like uh collect something or
05:52 - avoid something and those goals are
05:54 - often very simple because uh well
05:57 - because I have to make something quick
05:59 - and that's why many of the these games
06:02 - are score based or have very quick
06:06 - levels with with a very simple goal
06:09 - right uh I mean your brainstorming
06:11 - method seems really effective um it must
06:15 - be um since you've completed this
06:17 - project but something I I often see when
06:21 - when people start making games is that
06:24 - they start out by saying that it should
06:26 - accomplish this it should include this
06:28 - and have this and that and and what you
06:31 - really need to to um do is is just let
06:34 - your brain go wild as you said just come
06:37 - up with something that you know you can
06:39 - create and then later try to accomplish
06:41 - goals with it so not build up too many
06:43 - criteria in your head which the game has
06:46 - to fulfill because then you can just
06:48 - brainstorm and brainstorm and you will
06:49 - never really reach that goal and and
06:52 - also it's not about what the first
06:54 - prototype looks like but because that's
06:57 - always going to suck um but but it's
07:00 - really about taking something that that
07:02 - you think could be good and then just
07:05 - building on top of it and building and
07:07 - building until it finally looks polished
07:09 - um because you can't expect it to be um
07:12 - with the first prototype so what really
07:14 - got me into making games what was the
07:17 - idea of being able to combine Hobbies
07:19 - I've always been this hobby person and I
07:21 - could suddenly make music design and
07:24 - program and all of this in in and
07:26 - combine it into one piece but uh what
07:29 - what do you find most interesting about
07:31 - the process of making these smaller
07:33 - games is it problem solving coming up
07:35 - with mechanics um shoot right now the
07:39 - most interesting uh thing about making
07:41 - games for me is uh coming up with
07:44 - mechanics um because when I have made a
07:48 - mechanic and I've implemented it for the
07:51 - first time um when I then uh boot up the
07:56 - game for the first time and see how it
08:01 - actually uh works out I really
08:04 - understand a word that a lot of game
08:06 - developers use which is exploring that
08:10 - they feel that they're exploring a
08:12 - mechanic uh I really understand this the
08:15 - first time I boot it up because it's
08:17 - like I'm exploring this whole new uh
08:20 - well world that I've uh just created in
08:23 - a way so what's your next big project
08:26 - are we going to see 100 games in 100
08:28 - days or or do you have something more
08:30 - specific that you can tell us about um
08:33 - what what's what's the next big thing um
08:35 - from Mr zein Captain well actually I I
08:38 - have something very uh different in mind
08:42 - I am still going to work in game maker
08:44 - and make something 2D but my next
08:48 - project uh will the the most important
08:51 - uh thing for me right now is that I'll
08:53 - be able to make something where I focus
08:55 - on the details and go in into more depth
08:59 - uh with the project and uh more
09:03 - specifically the idea I'm working with
09:05 - right now is kind of a 2d version of
09:11 - Proteus um with a more heavy focus on
09:15 - interaction if that makes any kind of
09:18 - sense it does definitely but uh it looks
09:20 - like we are running out of time so
09:22 - basically if you want to play Mr
09:25 - Captain's games uh please W visit his
09:28 - website
09:29 - links on the screen and in the
09:31 - description or his Twitter again screen
09:34 - description and uh thank you for
09:36 - participating and thank you for having
09:38 - me enjoy the games
09:40 - [Music]
09:49 - everyone

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to this exclusive interview with the guy behind 31 games in 31 days he's called Victor AKA zein captain and he's just made his own Block featuring the 31 games so welcome to you Victor tell us how long have you been making games hello well uh I've been making games for uh about 6 years and I've been making most of them in game maker
