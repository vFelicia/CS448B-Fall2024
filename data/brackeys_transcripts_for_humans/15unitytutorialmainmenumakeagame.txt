00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - video number 15 in how to make a game a
00:08 - cool series of making a video game in
00:11 - unity wow it's been such a long time
00:14 - since the last one um I'm of course
00:16 - sorry that it's it's been such a while
00:20 - uh but I've had a lot of cool stuff to
00:22 - do in the meantime so since the last
00:26 - video I've started a series called how
00:28 - to make a 2d platform
00:30 - which I really think you should check
00:32 - out also started a series called um how
00:36 - to program in C SHP which is great if
00:39 - you want to make the transition
00:40 - transition from JavaScript to C or if
00:44 - you just want to become sharper on your
00:47 - language skills and also I've uh started
00:51 - a a smaller series covering some of the
00:53 - new stuff introduced with unity 4.6 beta
00:58 - because Unity 4.6 has has been released
01:00 - as a public beta and along with it the
01:03 - all new Unity guy system which is what
01:06 - we're going to be using today so today
01:08 - we're going to be creating this cool
01:10 - menu I can hit play here and you can see
01:14 - that we have a slider to adjust the
01:15 - Music Volume a play game button and a
01:18 - quit game button today we're not going
01:20 - to be making uh the actual uh sort of
01:24 - events happen when you actually interact
01:26 - with the menu but we will be setting it
01:29 - up like
01:31 - this um so before we get started I just
01:34 - quickly want to say that today's
01:36 - wallpaper can be downloaded at bra.com
01:39 - wallpapers the cool character here was
01:42 - made by a guy called Camilo also if you
01:45 - have any questions please head over to
01:47 - forum. bra.com where I among many other
01:50 - developers are just waiting to answer
01:52 - your questions and then of course if you
01:54 - want to download this uh beta head over
01:57 - to unity3d.com and go under Unity 4.6
02:01 - beta and you can download it for free
02:04 - here so that was it for the amazingly
02:07 - long intro now we can go ahead and get
02:10 - started with today's video so I'm just
02:14 - going to go ahead and and delete the
02:15 - scene here and load up the level that we
02:19 - uh we had when we left last and what
02:22 - we're going to do is we are first off
02:24 - going to duplicate this because we're
02:26 - going to be using many of the same
02:28 - elements so let's just selected in the
02:31 - uh project panel and hit contrl D and we
02:35 - can rename this to main menu now let's
02:39 - make sure to double click this so that
02:41 - we are in the main menu scene and uh
02:45 - let's go into the scene View and have a
02:46 - look at what we what is going on here so
02:49 - let's find our ball and hit F to focus
02:52 - on it now we can select uh all the
02:55 - platforms except one so we're just going
02:58 - to select all them here and just leave
03:01 - the one in the center then we can select
03:03 - the coin also and delete that we also
03:06 - going to delete the GM
03:08 - object and uh on the main camera here we
03:12 - are going to remove the camera control
03:14 - script so just hit remove component on
03:17 - that now let's with the camera selected
03:20 - let's just zoom bit in on the game
03:22 - object here let's move the camera up a
03:25 - bit and then let's rotate it uh along
03:29 - the Z
03:30 - oh no that's going to be the xaxis here
03:32 - so the red ring just going to rotate it
03:36 - down a bit and maybe move it even more
03:39 - up so it's going to look something like
03:43 - this uh we can go ahead and uh shift
03:46 - from local to Global uh orientation so
03:50 - we can move it up on the correct
03:53 - axis something like that looks pretty
03:55 - good uh I just want to make some room
03:58 - for the actual menu items up here so
04:01 - just have it kind of a uh just have the
04:04 - sky boox as a backdrop and then this to
04:08 - accompan the uh the main menu itself
04:11 - this looks pretty good and you will
04:13 - notice that we can still roll around
04:15 - with the ball which I think is a pretty
04:17 - fun little thing to be able to do in a
04:21 - menu now next up we are going to be
04:24 - using the unity so uh if you find
04:28 - anything to be difficult along the way
04:31 - here I suggest you go ahead and hit up
04:33 - uh the uh the guy specific videos that
04:37 - I've done lately um they should be quite
04:40 - a help so now we can right click in the
04:43 - hierarchy go under UI and let's just
04:45 - create a button and you can see that
04:48 - once we create this button three things
04:51 - are actually created a canvas which is
04:54 - uh kind of which represents the screen
04:59 - so the the total screen area that you
05:01 - have to uh you you've got to play with
05:04 - then we have a button which is the
05:06 - button and then an event system which is
05:09 - automatically created with any GUI this
05:12 - allows us to interact with the GUI
05:15 - system all of these are important so
05:18 - please don't delete any of them cool so
05:21 - what we want to do is we want to focus
05:23 - in on this canvas so go into 2D mode hit
05:27 - select the canvas and hit f and now we
05:30 - can zoom in so this is our screen we can
05:33 - select our button and maybe uh change
05:36 - the anchor so go up here on the the
05:37 - anchor presets and hit the top uh middle
05:41 - here that one so the flower looking
05:44 - anchor here is going to be moved to the
05:46 - center of the top and uh now let's scale
05:50 - this button up a bit so just drag in one
05:53 - of the corners hold down alt and hold
05:55 - down
05:56 - shift and then maybe just scale it a bit
05:59 - up here also uh that might be a bit too
06:04 - big let's just scale it down a bit again
06:07 - something like that now we can take our
06:10 - text here and uh we can go ahead and
06:13 - change the font size to something like
06:15 - 24 and we can change the text to play
06:20 - game and I'm just going to do this with
06:22 - capital letters that looks pretty cool
06:25 - now we can take our button and we can
06:27 - move it up and move it a bit to the left
06:31 - so just something like that looks pretty
06:35 - cool and uh yeah I'm actually pretty
06:38 - satisfied with that now we can go ahead
06:40 - and select the button and over here on
06:42 - the right hand side you can see that we
06:43 - have an image component and under the
06:46 - source image you can see that it has the
06:49 - uh default guey Sprite selected I'm just
06:52 - going to choose none instead because I
06:54 - don't want any of these Corners I don't
06:56 - really like the look of them uh and then
06:59 - I'm going to going to take the color and
07:00 - make it completely black but still keep
07:02 - the alpha value at something like
07:05 - 150 then we can go under the button
07:08 - select the text and let's just change
07:10 - the color here to completely white we
07:13 - could also go ahead and make this a bold
07:16 - text what you can also do is go under
07:18 - the canvas and select Pixel Perfect
07:22 - though uh I'm not going to be doing this
07:24 - here um for reasons I won't go into in
07:28 - this video
07:30 - so what we can do now is we can um we
07:33 - have this nice looking button let's just
07:35 - duplicate it to the other and move it to
07:38 - the other side here so we also have a
07:40 - quit game button let's select it hold
07:43 - down shift d oh it's control D I believe
07:47 - yeah command D if you're on a Mac now
07:49 - let's move it hold down shift while you
07:52 - move it to constrain it to one axis and
07:55 - you can move it over here but even
07:57 - better what we can do is we can simp
07:59 - simply remove the negative the minus
08:02 - here from our exp position and it
08:05 - will'll move it over and it even
08:08 - illustrates what we just changed you can
08:10 - see it says 144 here and it has this uh
08:15 - this line showing how we've moved it and
08:18 - that's because our position X Y and Z is
08:22 - always relative to our Anor which is up
08:26 - here so this is a
08:29 - 444 uh
08:31 - units from our
08:34 - origin to the anchor and that's
08:38 - completely correct now we can go under
08:40 - this button and we can change the text
08:42 - to quid
08:45 - game oops no space and that's basically
08:49 - it so now we have two cool looking
08:51 - buttons and you will notice that when we
08:54 - uh uh play the game and hover over them
08:56 - they will indeed animate which is pretty
09:00 - cool next thing we're going to do is
09:02 - we're going to create a slider with a
09:04 - label so let's go under the canvas let's
09:07 - right click hit UI and then uh let's do
09:13 - slider and uh let's go into the scene
09:16 - view again here let's again move the
09:18 - anger to the top uh middle here change
09:21 - the anger preset there now we can move
09:24 - up the slider something like there again
09:27 - holding down shift you only move on one
09:29 - axis now we can drag here while holding
09:33 - down alt to drag on both sides sides and
09:38 - uh just drag it over so it snaps nicely
09:41 - with the
09:42 - buttons then what we can do is we can
09:44 - make a little bit of room for our uh
09:48 - label so just move it in a bit there now
09:53 - let's go ahead and change uh the default
09:55 - value so go down here to value with the
09:58 - slide you selected and let's maybe do
10:01 - 0.6 or 7 for the default music um or
10:07 - let's actually make this maybe the
10:09 - general audio
10:11 - slider we could do that you could also
10:13 - make it the music H I don't know it's up
10:16 - to you uh but the default value is going
10:18 - to be
10:20 - 0.7 so what we can also do is we can
10:23 - change the appearance of this a bit so
10:25 - it looks a little nicer because I don't
10:27 - really like the look of it as it is
10:29 - right now so the image here is going to
10:32 - be the background image you can see that
10:34 - if I color it red this is what uh the
10:37 - element looks like and again I want to
10:40 - change this from the default background
10:42 - Sprite to just none to make it just a
10:44 - fill color and we can maybe go ahead and
10:47 - darken this quite a bit maybe even
10:50 - darken it as much as the buttons so
10:52 - again completely dark and then an alpha
10:55 - of
10:57 - 150 then we can go on to the slider and
10:59 - you can see we have the fill area which
11:01 - is the fill that illustrates how much uh
11:06 - that kind of illustrates the slider
11:09 - value that's what I meant to say and
11:11 - then we have the handle which is this
11:14 - little element right here so let's go
11:16 - under the fill and select the fill uh
11:20 - object now again let's just select none
11:23 - as the Sprite I think that looks nicer
11:27 - and maybe just tar in the white here a
11:30 - bit um also what I actually want to go
11:33 - ahead and do is I want to change the
11:35 - alpha to uh 255 which means it's
11:39 - completely visible and then go drag the
11:43 - uh the uh the color down a bit you could
11:45 - also go ahead and make this this an
11:47 - actual uh color if you would like it to
11:50 - have some kind of of style um I actually
11:53 - might go ahead and and just do that
11:56 - let's make it this kind of uh San
12:01 - color looks Al almost like futuristic
12:04 - and then maybe just a tad down with the
12:07 - alpha that actually looks pretty cool
12:10 - now we can go ahead and select the
12:11 - handle slide area and uh just open that
12:15 - up expand that select the handle and
12:18 - again um you can go ahead and select
12:21 - none here but the end uh the handle
12:24 - Sprite I actually like okay um so let's
12:27 - just change the color in that bump up
12:29 - the uh the alpha completely I don't like
12:32 - the way these elements show underneath
12:35 - just bump it up all the way and then
12:37 - change the uh the color to something you
12:41 - like maybe experiment with the colors
12:44 - here no I'm going to make that
12:46 - completely
12:47 - wide just maybe tone it down just a tad
12:51 - something like this I think looks pretty
12:53 - nice and you will notice now that again
12:56 - our slider is animated so when we have
12:58 - hover over it and click it it will um
13:02 - change accordingly and uh everything is
13:05 - actually working so the last thing that
13:08 - we are going to do is just put in the
13:11 - label so to do this uh right click on
13:13 - the canvas again go into UI and now
13:16 - select just
13:18 - text and uh let's make this let's Center
13:23 - this on the Y AIS by pressing here we
13:26 - can then change the text to let's say
13:28 - audio
13:30 - could put volume in here we could also
13:33 - just do
13:36 - volume I'm going to do
13:38 - audio and then uh just
13:41 - a um a colon and uh let's change the
13:46 - color here to maybe completely black uh
13:49 - just making it more visible yeah I think
13:51 - that's pretty good we could also try try
13:54 - just a a white that's not really visible
13:58 - enough
13:59 - we could go ahead and put uh some
14:01 - effects on this but uh that's for
14:03 - another video so let's just make this
14:05 - completely black and um maybe even scale
14:09 - it up a bit so let's change the font
14:11 - size to something like 17 that looks a
14:14 - lot better uh and now we can just
14:17 - position it so just go over here move it
14:19 - up again change the aner to the top
14:23 - middle just like all the other elements
14:26 - and let's scale it in here we're going
14:29 - to have to change the slider just a bit
14:31 - to make it fit uh something like this
14:35 - look actually looks pretty nice and
14:38 - there you have it so um maybe we can
14:41 - just move the slider
14:44 - over and there yeah I'm actually pretty
14:48 - satisfied with that so that it's it's
14:50 - actually that simple to create uh menus
14:53 - or or elements inside of the new
14:57 - Unity 4 .6 gooey system so that's
15:01 - basically it for today's video in the
15:04 - next Mega game video we're going to
15:06 - expand on this by making the buttons and
15:09 - the slider actually do something I just
15:12 - completely forgot to add the music for
15:15 - our main menu so in order to do this
15:17 - simply drag the music prefab that we've
15:20 - already created into the hierarchy and
15:23 - music will play when you play the scene
15:26 - we will have a look at making this music
15:28 - seamlessly transition onto the next
15:31 - level when we actually Implement uh the
15:34 - the button events so that will be for a
15:37 - future video so again thanks for
15:40 - watching I'm looking forward to seeing
15:42 - what series you would uh prefer to see
15:45 - and uh yeah thanks for watching I'll see
15:47 - you in the next
15:49 - [Music]
15:57 - video yeah

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to video number 15 in how to make a game a cool series of making a video game in unity wow it's been such a long time since the last one um I'm of course sorry that it's it's been such a while uh but I've had a lot of cool stuff to do in the meantime so since the last video I've started a series called how to make a 2d platform which I really think you should check out also started a series called um how to program in C SHP which is great if you want to make the transition transition from JavaScript to C or if you just want to become sharper on your language skills and also I've uh started a a smaller series covering some of the new stuff introduced with unity 4.6 beta because Unity 4.6 has has been released as a public beta and along with it the all new Unity guy system which is what we're going to be using today so today we're going to be creating this cool menu I can hit play here and you can see that we have a slider to adjust the Music Volume a play game button and a quit game button today we're not going to be making uh the actual uh sort of events happen when you actually interact with the menu but we will be setting it up like this um so before we get started I just quickly want to say that today's wallpaper can be downloaded at bra.com wallpapers the cool character here was made by a guy called Camilo also if you have any questions please head over to forum. bra.com where I among many other developers are just waiting to answer your questions and then of course if you want to download this uh beta head over to unity3d.com and go under Unity 4.6 beta and you can download it for free here so that was it for the amazingly long intro now we can go ahead and get started with today's video so I'm just going to go ahead and and delete the scene here and load up the level that we uh we had when we left last and what we're going to do is we are first off going to duplicate this because we're going to be using many of the same elements so let's just selected in the uh project panel and hit contrl D and we can rename this to main menu now let's make sure to double click this so that we are in the main menu scene and uh let's go into the scene View and have a look at what we what is going on here so let's find our ball and hit F to focus on it now we can select uh all the platforms except one so we're just going to select all them here and just leave the one in the center then we can select the coin also and delete that we also going to delete the GM object and uh on the main camera here we are going to remove the camera control script so just hit remove component on that now let's with the camera selected let's just zoom bit in on the game object here let's move the camera up a bit and then let's rotate it uh along the Z oh no that's going to be the xaxis here so the red ring just going to rotate it down a bit and maybe move it even more up so it's going to look something like this uh we can go ahead and uh shift from local to Global uh orientation so we can move it up on the correct axis something like that looks pretty good uh I just want to make some room for the actual menu items up here so just have it kind of a uh just have the sky boox as a backdrop and then this to accompan the uh the main menu itself this looks pretty good and you will notice that we can still roll around with the ball which I think is a pretty fun little thing to be able to do in a menu now next up we are going to be using the unity so uh if you find anything to be difficult along the way here I suggest you go ahead and hit up uh the uh the guy specific videos that I've done lately um they should be quite a help so now we can right click in the hierarchy go under UI and let's just create a button and you can see that once we create this button three things are actually created a canvas which is uh kind of which represents the screen so the the total screen area that you have to uh you you've got to play with then we have a button which is the button and then an event system which is automatically created with any GUI this allows us to interact with the GUI system all of these are important so please don't delete any of them cool so what we want to do is we want to focus in on this canvas so go into 2D mode hit select the canvas and hit f and now we can zoom in so this is our screen we can select our button and maybe uh change the anchor so go up here on the the anchor presets and hit the top uh middle here that one so the flower looking anchor here is going to be moved to the center of the top and uh now let's scale this button up a bit so just drag in one of the corners hold down alt and hold down shift and then maybe just scale it a bit up here also uh that might be a bit too big let's just scale it down a bit again something like that now we can take our text here and uh we can go ahead and change the font size to something like 24 and we can change the text to play game and I'm just going to do this with capital letters that looks pretty cool now we can take our button and we can move it up and move it a bit to the left so just something like that looks pretty cool and uh yeah I'm actually pretty satisfied with that now we can go ahead and select the button and over here on the right hand side you can see that we have an image component and under the source image you can see that it has the uh default guey Sprite selected I'm just going to choose none instead because I don't want any of these Corners I don't really like the look of them uh and then I'm going to going to take the color and make it completely black but still keep the alpha value at something like 150 then we can go under the button select the text and let's just change the color here to completely white we could also go ahead and make this a bold text what you can also do is go under the canvas and select Pixel Perfect though uh I'm not going to be doing this here um for reasons I won't go into in this video so what we can do now is we can um we have this nice looking button let's just duplicate it to the other and move it to the other side here so we also have a quit game button let's select it hold down shift d oh it's control D I believe yeah command D if you're on a Mac now let's move it hold down shift while you move it to constrain it to one axis and you can move it over here but even better what we can do is we can simp simply remove the negative the minus here from our exp position and it will'll move it over and it even illustrates what we just changed you can see it says 144 here and it has this uh this line showing how we've moved it and that's because our position X Y and Z is always relative to our Anor which is up here so this is a 444 uh units from our origin to the anchor and that's completely correct now we can go under this button and we can change the text to quid game oops no space and that's basically it so now we have two cool looking buttons and you will notice that when we uh uh play the game and hover over them they will indeed animate which is pretty cool next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a slider with a label so let's go under the canvas let's right click hit UI and then uh let's do slider and uh let's go into the scene view again here let's again move the anger to the top uh middle here change the anger preset there now we can move up the slider something like there again holding down shift you only move on one axis now we can drag here while holding down alt to drag on both sides sides and uh just drag it over so it snaps nicely with the buttons then what we can do is we can make a little bit of room for our uh label so just move it in a bit there now let's go ahead and change uh the default value so go down here to value with the slide you selected and let's maybe do 0.6 or 7 for the default music um or let's actually make this maybe the general audio slider we could do that you could also make it the music H I don't know it's up to you uh but the default value is going to be 0.7 so what we can also do is we can change the appearance of this a bit so it looks a little nicer because I don't really like the look of it as it is right now so the image here is going to be the background image you can see that if I color it red this is what uh the element looks like and again I want to change this from the default background Sprite to just none to make it just a fill color and we can maybe go ahead and darken this quite a bit maybe even darken it as much as the buttons so again completely dark and then an alpha of 150 then we can go on to the slider and you can see we have the fill area which is the fill that illustrates how much uh that kind of illustrates the slider value that's what I meant to say and then we have the handle which is this little element right here so let's go under the fill and select the fill uh object now again let's just select none as the Sprite I think that looks nicer and maybe just tar in the white here a bit um also what I actually want to go ahead and do is I want to change the alpha to uh 255 which means it's completely visible and then go drag the uh the uh the color down a bit you could also go ahead and make this this an actual uh color if you would like it to have some kind of of style um I actually might go ahead and and just do that let's make it this kind of uh San color looks Al almost like futuristic and then maybe just a tad down with the alpha that actually looks pretty cool now we can go ahead and select the handle slide area and uh just open that up expand that select the handle and again um you can go ahead and select none here but the end uh the handle Sprite I actually like okay um so let's just change the color in that bump up the uh the alpha completely I don't like the way these elements show underneath just bump it up all the way and then change the uh the color to something you like maybe experiment with the colors here no I'm going to make that completely wide just maybe tone it down just a tad something like this I think looks pretty nice and you will notice now that again our slider is animated so when we have hover over it and click it it will um change accordingly and uh everything is actually working so the last thing that we are going to do is just put in the label so to do this uh right click on the canvas again go into UI and now select just text and uh let's make this let's Center this on the Y AIS by pressing here we can then change the text to let's say audio could put volume in here we could also just do volume I'm going to do audio and then uh just a um a colon and uh let's change the color here to maybe completely black uh just making it more visible yeah I think that's pretty good we could also try try just a a white that's not really visible enough we could go ahead and put uh some effects on this but uh that's for another video so let's just make this completely black and um maybe even scale it up a bit so let's change the font size to something like 17 that looks a lot better uh and now we can just position it so just go over here move it up again change the aner to the top middle just like all the other elements and let's scale it in here we're going to have to change the slider just a bit to make it fit uh something like this look actually looks pretty nice and there you have it so um maybe we can just move the slider over and there yeah I'm actually pretty satisfied with that so that it's it's actually that simple to create uh menus or or elements inside of the new Unity 4 .6 gooey system so that's basically it for today's video in the next Mega game video we're going to expand on this by making the buttons and the slider actually do something I just completely forgot to add the music for our main menu so in order to do this simply drag the music prefab that we've already created into the hierarchy and music will play when you play the scene we will have a look at making this music seamlessly transition onto the next level when we actually Implement uh the the button events so that will be for a future video so again thanks for watching I'm looking forward to seeing what series you would uh prefer to see and uh yeah thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video yeah
