00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to this video and creating a
00:05 - multiplayer FPS in unity today we are
00:07 - going to be creating a user account
00:09 - system with a login menu that means when
00:12 - our player opens up the game you will be
00:14 - able to register an account or use an
00:17 - already existing account to log in and
00:19 - each account will then have some kind of
00:22 - data associated to it so will be able to
00:24 - store stuff like kill count how many
00:27 - deaths the player has on a level
00:30 - maybe even some weapon unlocks but
00:33 - depending on what you want to do with
00:35 - your game now when it comes to doing
00:37 - these kind of databases especially when
00:40 - they are hosted there are a bunch of
00:43 - different ways of doing it some very
00:45 - complicated and some fairly easy and
00:48 - we're going to be focusing on the fairly
00:51 - easy today so we this is by no means a
00:54 - tutorial on how to set up a huge
00:57 - database with lots of control that is
01:00 - super secure but I will get into your
01:03 - options in just a second I also want to
01:06 - mention that if you haven't seen the
01:07 - last video we set up a super cool
01:09 - looking arena so if you want to have
01:11 - that part of your game you should click
01:13 - the screen now to check that out in case
01:15 - you had in case you missed it so without
01:17 - further ado let's dive right into
01:19 - today's video so you can see that I'm in
01:22 - fact not here in unity I'm here in
01:24 - chrome and I'm looking at the web
01:26 - version of the asset store on an asset
01:28 - called database control and this is the
01:31 - free version so the free version of this
01:33 - has been out for quite a while and let
01:35 - me first explain the very classic way of
01:39 - doing this sort of stuff and that is
01:41 - creating your own database using some
01:44 - software such as MySQL or my sequel
01:49 - depending on how you want to pronounce
01:51 - that and then hooking that up to some
01:53 - kind of web programming language such as
01:56 - PHP is very commonly used and on that
02:00 - has some programming aspects that does
02:03 - require some knowledge there and that's
02:05 - not the thing that we are going to be
02:08 - going with here and then you need to
02:10 - then host that
02:12 - database on your own or using some kind
02:15 - of hosting service that you you simply
02:17 - buy some server space you can of course
02:20 - build your own server that is also a
02:22 - hold on the field and when it comes to
02:25 - these databases it's a lot about
02:27 - managing them how large they are do we
02:31 - need server space how quick is this and
02:34 - also a lot of worries about security and
02:37 - um it's really a whole world and you can
02:41 - of course get into that stuff and if you
02:43 - want to build the next World of Warcraft
02:45 - you definitely have to but I find that
02:50 - this asset for what we are going to be
02:52 - doing actually is really really cool so
02:56 - what this basically does if you import
02:58 - this into unity is that they create a
03:00 - database for you they hosted on their
03:03 - own servers and they allow you to create
03:06 - a bunch of users actually they are they
03:09 - state that you can create an unlimited
03:10 - amount of users but that is of course
03:13 - only a theoretical limit and you can for
03:17 - each user you can associate a username a
03:19 - password and then you have a text
03:23 - variable and which is basically just
03:24 - more a stream and that then you might
03:28 - think well I want to have all kinds of
03:31 - stuff register to user I want to have
03:32 - kill count deaths pounds I want a weapon
03:35 - unlocks all that and you might be able
03:38 - you might limit yourself a little bit
03:40 - but you are actually able to save quite
03:43 - a few things in the text variable
03:45 - because when you think about it a lot of
03:47 - this data can be converted to text and
03:50 - you can have a bunch of different things
03:52 - in this a string that you then on pull
03:56 - out of it are using your own syntax you
03:58 - can separate different pieces of them of
04:02 - data with your own symbols and then
04:04 - simply find them in the string so there
04:08 - are ways of using this to store it on
04:10 - more data now I will put a disclaimer
04:12 - here this is by no means a safe way of
04:15 - doing it and they even stayed this in
04:17 - the readme it has absolutely no security
04:20 - so if security and stability is very
04:25 - pardon and if you want to get your game
04:27 - out to a lot of usage and not just use
04:30 - this as a fun project well then actually
04:32 - you're in luck because uh the same guy
04:36 - just released data based control Pro and
04:38 - I mean really just released it it's like
04:41 - an hour ago when recording this video
04:43 - and that means I haven't used this but I
04:45 - followed him on the forum and basically
04:49 - this delivers some more security some
04:52 - more edit ability in the database you
04:55 - can have more data fields in there you
04:58 - can see it says here secure and reliable
05:00 - again I don't I haven't tested this
05:02 - myself because it's so new but I wanted
05:04 - to mention this as an option so that is
05:07 - what we're going to be going with the
05:08 - data base control free here explore your
05:11 - options or just get into the to the fun
05:14 - part with me right away so let's get
05:17 - started with that so you can see in
05:20 - unity here we have our scene and we will
05:22 - just be leaving this now we're not going
05:24 - to be using it right away let's go into
05:27 - a lobby instead and shift into 2d mode
05:30 - here and focus in on our canvas and Cole
05:34 - I think we are ready for import here so
05:36 - let's go back on the browser that's it
05:38 - opening unity launch application and of
05:41 - course I will have a download link
05:43 - available to you in the description and
05:47 - then we can hit a download and I've
05:49 - already done that so I'm just going to
05:51 - hit import here and it will store
05:53 - everything in one single folder so you
05:55 - don't need to click off anything and hit
05:57 - import and basically it will import
05:59 - super quickly because it's pretty much
06:01 - only a few text files and a DLL or
06:06 - something so it's a very small file and
06:09 - we can clear the console here and you
06:11 - can see that we now have a new folder
06:13 - called database control and this comes
06:15 - with a readme that is very useful and
06:18 - actually quite easy to read so I
06:21 - definitely are recommend that you scroll
06:23 - through this if you have any questions
06:25 - there's also a way to contact the guy
06:28 - and yeah there's also a setup guide here
06:32 - so if anything changes from my video
06:34 - consult the readme cool so basically
06:37 - what he recommends
06:38 - you to do is to begin by going to window
06:41 - and then selecting database control free
06:44 - and you can see here that mine is
06:47 - currently loading and you can see that
06:49 - I've already set up my database if it
06:51 - says you haven't created the database
06:53 - yet simply hit create database and it
06:56 - should do that on its own I'm going to
06:58 - select that I want to use database 1 you
07:01 - get the possibility to have two
07:03 - databases using the free version one for
07:06 - each project so you can only have one in
07:08 - one project so I'm just going to be
07:10 - using database 1 here and you can see it
07:13 - says database set up and ready to go and
07:15 - now we can continue and you get a
07:17 - database ID which I will blur out and
07:19 - you have the possibility to empty the
07:23 - database so you can click this button at
07:25 - any point and it will remove all current
07:28 - users from that database and all that
07:31 - data it will completely empty it out so
07:34 - be careful with this option so I'll just
07:36 - empty mine right now in case I have
07:39 - something on that and you might get a an
07:41 - argument exception but it did empty it
07:44 - out I've gotten those don't know why
07:46 - it's happening but it is working so
07:49 - let's just close this down here so I
07:52 - don't have to play it for the entire
07:53 - video and what we can do now is we can
07:56 - go and find the demo scene under this
07:59 - c-sharp demo and this is frankly not a
08:02 - pretty scene if we double click to open
08:03 - it up but it does have some really cool
08:07 - things in here mainly under the menu
08:09 - control object it has this a DC demo
08:13 - menu control c-sharp script and this is
08:16 - basically just an example of how to use
08:19 - the API provided by the asset provided
08:23 - by the dll's that allows you to register
08:27 - users login get and send data to the
08:32 - database and it actually does work right
08:36 - off the bat so if we were to use this UI
08:38 - right here right now and see you hit
08:41 - play here and it tells you that you need
08:42 - to do the window thing first which we
08:44 - have done then we are able to try and
08:48 - log in so if I do something like test 1
08:51 - 2 3 and
08:52 - do the same for the password here and
08:54 - hit login it should say that there is no
08:56 - user at the moment username not found
08:59 - then we can register it all register
09:01 - again test one two three I'll do the
09:03 - same down here with the password and the
09:06 - confirm password and I'll register it'll
09:09 - take a moment to register the user and
09:11 - you can see that I'm now logged in and
09:13 - I'm able to send some data and get some
09:16 - data and the sending and getting data
09:18 - will not be looking at today we'll be
09:20 - focusing on the login menu itself so I'm
09:23 - now able to log out and then I'm able to
09:26 - log back in here so test one two three
09:29 - login and I'm now a registered user so I
09:31 - get back in here
09:33 - cool so what we'll be doing is we'll
09:36 - start by just using this demo script and
09:39 - we'll maybe edit it and we'll definitely
09:41 - edit it at a later point maybe even
09:43 - create our own if you want to create
09:45 - your own again the readme it's awesome
09:47 - everything is in there but I thought
09:49 - that we would just spider spice up this
09:51 - interface to make it fit our game a bit
09:54 - bedroom so what we'll do is we'll use
09:56 - this as a base so let's just duplicate
09:58 - this to keep the original and we'll call
10:01 - this one r1 actually let's just call
10:05 - this one log in there and we'll put this
10:10 - down with our other scenes and close
10:13 - database control folder here collapse
10:15 - that and then double click on that to
10:17 - make sure that you have that open you
10:19 - can see that up here and now we need to
10:21 - do a bunch of UI editing good so let's
10:25 - take a look at what we have under your
10:27 - canvas the first thing is our background
10:29 - and I thought we were just for
10:31 - consistency sake find the same
10:33 - background color as on our lobby here so
10:35 - let's find the background go to image
10:38 - copy the hex color go to login again go
10:41 - into canvas background and then copy the
10:43 - hex color in there so we'll get the same
10:46 - thing and the first thing that we are
10:49 - looking at here is the login menu and I
10:52 - just want to delete the important object
10:55 - here just the notice up here it's not
10:57 - important for us and then let's open up
11:00 - the login here and see what we have in
11:03 - here so we have a title we
11:06 - have some input fields with a few
11:09 - description are texts as well we have
11:12 - this text error which is basically just
11:14 - space for an error message if it if
11:18 - there are any errors that could be user
11:21 - not found or blank fields or stuff like
11:25 - that and then we have two buttons a
11:27 - locking and a register so let's just go
11:29 - ahead and actually disable this entire
11:33 - object for now and let's create our own
11:36 - so let's go right click create empty and
11:39 - let's scale this empty up so let's click
11:43 - and drag in one of the corners and hit
11:46 - down all or hold down alt to scale in
11:50 - both axes at once and we'll have it sit
11:53 - somewhere like there and let's make this
11:55 - a arm and it's going to be a vertical
11:58 - layout group as that will position
12:01 - things for us and we'll also call this
12:04 - log in here that's the new log in and we
12:07 - don't want to a force expand on the
12:10 - height and then we want to add a new
12:12 - element here which is going to be an
12:14 - input field and we want to drag that out
12:16 - and back in to have it snap correctly
12:19 - let's add component and then we are
12:22 - going to go layout element and let's
12:24 - select a preferred height of let's say
12:28 - 30 that works and everything else looks
12:31 - pretty good let's just rename this to
12:33 - user name and you can go input field or
12:37 - something I'm just going to call it user
12:38 - name and have the placeholder be user
12:42 - name and then a dot dot dot because that
12:44 - looks super cool and then what we will
12:48 - do is we will go to login and have this
12:51 - are aligned by the middle Center and I
12:57 - actually already like that a lot we'll
12:59 - also have the spacing be something like
13:01 - ten pixels so that when we make another
13:03 - element now there's a bit of distance
13:05 - between them so just duplicate that by
13:07 - hitting ctrl G or command D if you're on
13:09 - a Mac and this is going to be the
13:10 - password and we're going to change the
13:13 - placeholder text as well to password dot
13:17 - dot dot
13:19 - then we need two buttons we need one for
13:21 - register and one for login so let's
13:23 - right click on here go and let's
13:27 - actually make another empty object for
13:29 - this and I'll show you why this is cool
13:32 - in a second and let's make this a
13:34 - horizontal layout group so we can have
13:37 - the 2 buttons side by side down here and
13:40 - let's create another UI button undo that
13:43 - and let's drag it out and drag it back
13:46 - in something like that and let's add a
13:49 - component to this which is also going to
13:51 - be a layout element with a preferred
13:53 - height of 35 and let's go here and
13:59 - disabled child force expand on the
14:02 - height and you can see now that this is
14:04 - 35 tall and we can make this the let's
14:08 - make this the login button
14:10 - so login actually let's just add a
14:14 - button here so we are very clear about
14:16 - what's going on and this is going to say
14:18 - login cool and then we can duplicate
14:23 - that and call this the register register
14:27 - button and we'll edit the text on this
14:31 - as well so register like that and we can
14:35 - add a bit of spacing between them
14:37 - something like 5 pixels should be fine
14:39 - and you can see that see that we now
14:41 - have two input fields and two buttons
14:43 - and the last thing that we need to
14:45 - create is on the text object that will
14:48 - display any error messages if there is
14:51 - some so let's just rename this one two
14:54 - buttons and let's go right click on our
14:58 - login go UI text and let's find this
15:02 - text object it's up here again move it
15:05 - out move it back in it's kind of knowing
15:07 - you have to do that but you do and let's
15:10 - change the color here to some kind of
15:12 - red and I want don't want this to be too
15:15 - crazy but I do want it to be visible and
15:17 - clear that this is an error and let's
15:20 - make this italic just to make that super
15:23 - clear and let's just fill this in as
15:27 - error text and let's name it the same so
15:33 - texts and I think that is pretty much
15:37 - all we need to do for the login screen
15:39 - so now we need to we can just delete the
15:41 - previous login screen again you can go
15:43 - not by deleting everything as long as we
15:46 - have a copy here to use as reference and
15:48 - then we can select our menu control and
15:51 - I want to drag this to the very top and
15:53 - you can see we now have some missing
15:54 - fields so the first one is our login
15:57 - object itself that is the parent object
15:59 - there we go then we have a login input
16:02 - login username that is our input field
16:05 - username and our input field password
16:08 - and then we have the login error there
16:10 - which is just going to be the error text
16:12 - actually let me just rename that to
16:16 - login error text that's fine and that
16:20 - should be it and now we are actually
16:23 - already able to play that and we won't
16:26 - get any errors however our buttons won't
16:28 - work so we need to go in to our buttons
16:31 - find our login button
16:32 - I had an on click event drag in our menu
16:35 - control and then if you go on the
16:37 - function and find this script here and
16:39 - the naming on that script is a bit crazy
16:41 - but you will be able to find it we can
16:43 - go under login and you want this to be
16:45 - prefixed with login because it's under
16:47 - the locking menu and then login again so
16:51 - under the login we want to find the
16:53 - login button and that will make sure to
16:56 - call the appropriate function for when
16:59 - we want to login and then we'll do the
17:02 - same with the register button so add an
17:04 - on-click event drag in the game object
17:06 - and then go to login register button and
17:10 - that should actually be it so now we are
17:13 - able to use this UI here if we hit play
17:16 - and you won't get any errors and if I
17:18 - just hit login we'll get a field blank
17:21 - notice here and if I use test one two
17:23 - three and then on test one two three and
17:26 - hit login ah it should actually work and
17:29 - you can see transitions on to the next C
17:31 - so that is completely armed that is
17:35 - actually perfect so the next thing that
17:38 - we want to create is the loading screen
17:41 - as we just saw it so the loading screen
17:43 - here is currently very yellow and we
17:45 - don't want it to
17:46 - Yello at all so that's going and find
17:49 - the different elements here first off we
17:51 - have a text object
17:52 - I just want to bump down the size on
17:54 - this I think it's way too much let's go
17:56 - 24 and let's Center this on the vertical
18:02 - axis and let's also change the image
18:05 - here I definitely want to have them in
18:07 - the image here but I want to change it
18:09 - and make sure the scale is 1 1 1 so we
18:12 - only scale using the pixels and let's
18:15 - actually drag it out from the circle
18:17 - object and you can see this has a demo
18:20 - loading rotate script which basically
18:22 - just rotates on the image over time
18:25 - let's take that's actually copy this
18:28 - component remove the circle object and
18:31 - then I'll paste it onto the image
18:33 - instead here so let's paste component as
18:36 - new and that's going to be fine let's
18:38 - change this to positive 360 so we'll do
18:44 - a full rotation in one second I believe
18:46 - and let's change the source image on to
18:49 - use and if we just ctrl ctrl scroll
18:53 - you'll be able to see all of it the
18:55 - button reset that we get from our
18:57 - standard assets cross form cross
19:00 - platform input I think this works great
19:02 - as a loading icon so we'll just use that
19:06 - and sit native size and then we can just
19:08 - resize it here so I will also set the
19:11 - loading text to use a white color
19:14 - something like that and we can position
19:17 - it here in the center of the screen I
19:20 - think we're getting there
19:22 - actually I want that to be a lot smaller
19:24 - and of course you should play around
19:29 - with this more than I do however that
19:33 - looks fine to me for now at least
19:36 - that is totally usable so we'll just
19:38 - have those be in there and the
19:42 - references should still be set up just
19:45 - fine so that should now be a loading
19:47 - screen and we can just hit play here and
19:49 - it doesn't matter which one of these
19:50 - that you have enabled at the beginning
19:53 - it will go ahead and our
19:58 - configured properly and hit login here
20:00 - and you can see that the login our
20:03 - loading screen is not working properly
20:04 - so that's perfect
20:06 - I just noticed under our login here that
20:08 - we want to find our password input field
20:11 - and we want to go down here and change
20:13 - the content content type to password so
20:17 - that whatever we type in is invisible so
20:20 - that it will just be showing these stars
20:24 - there instead so that's perfect and we
20:28 - can disable the login screen and work on
20:30 - the register screen so you can see that
20:32 - this is all also kind of a UI mess but
20:36 - that's fine it's very easy for us to
20:37 - edit so let's use our current login
20:40 - screen as a base to work off so let's
20:42 - duplicate that that's called this one
20:44 - register as well let's enable it and
20:48 - basically we just need to add another
20:51 - field
20:51 - so let's duplicate the password field
20:53 - here and let's rename this to the
20:57 - confirm password and we'll change the
21:02 - placeholder here as well to confirm
21:04 - password dot dot dot cool and the
21:12 - buttons now should be register and back
21:16 - to note navigate back to the our login
21:19 - screen so we'll have a register element
21:22 - over here and then we'll have this be
21:24 - the back button so back button and we'll
21:29 - change the text on this to back and that
21:31 - should actually bid we also need a
21:34 - register arrow text and that is pretty
21:39 - much all we need to change however of
21:41 - course we need to set up the correct
21:43 - references so let's now delete the
21:44 - register pre our object that comes with
21:49 - the scene and let's set up our own here
21:52 - so first we need to set up the button on
21:55 - click events here so whit now on this
21:58 - shouldn't call login login button now
22:02 - this should call register back button
22:05 - and the register button should call
22:07 - register register button
22:10 - cool and that should be it and then we
22:12 - can choose our menu control we need to
22:16 - drag in the register parent object we
22:18 - need to drag in the register user name
22:21 - we need to drag in the register password
22:25 - and the register confirm password and
22:29 - then finally the register error so here
22:31 - the register error text and that should
22:35 - all be working out so if we hit play it
22:37 - will go to the login screen we can hit
22:39 - register we can go back so that's
22:41 - working hit register again and let's
22:43 - make a new user here that's called this
22:45 - on the odd test user and let's just do
22:50 - test user actually test user and test
22:54 - user and let's hit register it's going
22:57 - to load a little bit and it's going to
22:59 - log us in as test users so that is
23:02 - indeed working as well so the last thing
23:07 - that we need to change here is the
23:08 - actual locked in screen what gets
23:10 - displayed when we are logged in and of
23:12 - course we don't want the locked in
23:14 - screen we want to transition onto a
23:17 - lobby where we can join games and all
23:20 - that stuff but for now because we are
23:22 - just are kind of looking at our login
23:26 - system and our user system as an
23:29 - isolated entity and then we'll plug it
23:32 - into the game later let's just have the
23:35 - locking system in here and just have it
23:37 - display the most unnecessary information
23:40 - such as our username and a logout button
23:43 - so we'll just keep those two things so
23:46 - that's actually for this one just go in
23:48 - and edit it directly and what I want to
23:51 - do is I want to delete these two panels
23:52 - there are not needed for what we are
23:55 - doing so just delete those two lets on
23:58 - and let's delete the sent data button
24:02 - let's delete the umm let's see here so
24:06 - let's go through let's delete the title
24:08 - let's delete the info let's keep that
24:12 - locked in s and the username so text
24:15 - info 1 and 2 let's keep those let's
24:17 - delete text info 3 and text info 5
24:20 - however we do want to keep text info
24:24 - for or else it will throw an error
24:26 - because this is referenced in menu
24:28 - control you can see it says text info
24:30 - for here so let's just go ahead and go
24:32 - ahead and disable this for the moment to
24:34 - avoid errors but to not have it clutter
24:37 - up the screen let's also find our input
24:39 - data here we can know that is also used
24:42 - let's just disable that as well the text
24:45 - error that's the same thing that's the
24:47 - lead or disable it and then we can
24:49 - remove the get data button so now we
24:51 - only have locked in s and then the
24:53 - username and a logout button and we'll
24:56 - delete the logout button and create that
24:57 - on our own so let's go UI button and
25:00 - let's I call this the I log out button
25:04 - and we just change the text on this to
25:08 - actually I'll write sign out here that
25:11 - is the new black and we can change the
25:14 - height of this button to select the
25:17 - button 2:35 to be consistent with our
25:20 - height and just drag it down a bit
25:23 - something like there that looks fine and
25:25 - then let's change of course the color of
25:27 - a lock in s let's also make this a lot
25:30 - smaller let's do something like maybe on
25:33 - 20 Center that on the vertical axis
25:37 - let's make it snap to the right here and
25:40 - let's just move that over scale that
25:43 - over so it snaps to the about the center
25:46 - of a button there and then let's find
25:49 - our user name here which is text info
25:51 - too and let's make that completely wide
25:54 - as well actually let's make this a bit
25:57 - more of a gray to really make our user
26:01 - name stand out and we can maybe even
26:02 - make this bold so it's very clear that
26:05 - this is an important piece of
26:06 - information and we can move this over
26:09 - just a tad as well and actually take
26:12 - both both of these and move them over
26:14 - just a tiny bit something like that so
26:17 - it's kind of centered and on that is all
26:20 - we need to do so now we can just rename
26:22 - this to locked in as text and this is
26:28 - the username text and that is pretty
26:32 - much all so now we can go to menu
26:34 - control and everything should still
26:38 - set up right there so let's now hit save
26:41 - and let's hit play and see if our system
26:44 - works so we know that we can register
26:47 - and all of that but now we can login as
26:50 - either test 1 2 3 or test users which
26:53 - are the two different users that we have
26:55 - registered and I'm just going to log in
26:57 - as test 1 2 3 so I'm going to write that
27:01 - both in the username and the password
27:03 - you can of course have a password that
27:05 - is different from the username which is
27:07 - definitely preferred then we can hit
27:10 - login here it's going to use our cool
27:12 - loading screen and it's going to say
27:14 - logged in as test 1 2 3 and then in some
27:18 - of the next videos what I will show what
27:21 - we will do there is we will create some
27:23 - data that will be able to persist
27:26 - between game sessions so between the
27:29 - scenes when you can log off you can sign
27:32 - back in at a later time
27:33 - and you will still have your progress in
27:35 - the game saved on the database guy's
27:40 - servers so that is super cool I think
27:43 - this plugins in is awesome for people
27:47 - who just want to get that game working
27:49 - and try some of this stuff out but maybe
27:52 - aren't PHP or my sequel expert so yeah
27:56 - that's pretty much all I wanted to show
27:58 - in this video I hope you thought that
27:59 - this was exciting I definitely did and
28:01 - without further ado thanks for watching
28:03 - and I'll see you in the next video thank
28:06 - you so much to all of the awesome
28:07 - patreon supporters who donated in July
28:09 - and a special thanks to vixen famous own
28:12 - Andrew K and locks game TV these videos
28:15 - wouldn't be possible without you

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to this video and creating a multiplayer FPS in unity today we are going to be creating a user account system with a login menu that means when our player opens up the game you will be able to register an account or use an already existing account to log in and each account will then have some kind of data associated to it so will be able to store stuff like kill count how many deaths the player has on a level maybe even some weapon unlocks but depending on what you want to do with your game now when it comes to doing these kind of databases especially when they are hosted there are a bunch of different ways of doing it some very complicated and some fairly easy and we're going to be focusing on the fairly easy today so we this is by no means a tutorial on how to set up a huge database with lots of control that is super secure but I will get into your options in just a second I also want to mention that if you haven't seen the last video we set up a super cool looking arena so if you want to have that part of your game you should click the screen now to check that out in case you had in case you missed it so without further ado let's dive right into today's video so you can see that I'm in fact not here in unity I'm here in chrome and I'm looking at the web version of the asset store on an asset called database control and this is the free version so the free version of this has been out for quite a while and let me first explain the very classic way of doing this sort of stuff and that is creating your own database using some software such as MySQL or my sequel depending on how you want to pronounce that and then hooking that up to some kind of web programming language such as PHP is very commonly used and on that has some programming aspects that does require some knowledge there and that's not the thing that we are going to be going with here and then you need to then host that database on your own or using some kind of hosting service that you you simply buy some server space you can of course build your own server that is also a hold on the field and when it comes to these databases it's a lot about managing them how large they are do we need server space how quick is this and also a lot of worries about security and um it's really a whole world and you can of course get into that stuff and if you want to build the next World of Warcraft you definitely have to but I find that this asset for what we are going to be doing actually is really really cool so what this basically does if you import this into unity is that they create a database for you they hosted on their own servers and they allow you to create a bunch of users actually they are they state that you can create an unlimited amount of users but that is of course only a theoretical limit and you can for each user you can associate a username a password and then you have a text variable and which is basically just more a stream and that then you might think well I want to have all kinds of stuff register to user I want to have kill count deaths pounds I want a weapon unlocks all that and you might be able you might limit yourself a little bit but you are actually able to save quite a few things in the text variable because when you think about it a lot of this data can be converted to text and you can have a bunch of different things in this a string that you then on pull out of it are using your own syntax you can separate different pieces of them of data with your own symbols and then simply find them in the string so there are ways of using this to store it on more data now I will put a disclaimer here this is by no means a safe way of doing it and they even stayed this in the readme it has absolutely no security so if security and stability is very pardon and if you want to get your game out to a lot of usage and not just use this as a fun project well then actually you're in luck because uh the same guy just released data based control Pro and I mean really just released it it's like an hour ago when recording this video and that means I haven't used this but I followed him on the forum and basically this delivers some more security some more edit ability in the database you can have more data fields in there you can see it says here secure and reliable again I don't I haven't tested this myself because it's so new but I wanted to mention this as an option so that is what we're going to be going with the data base control free here explore your options or just get into the to the fun part with me right away so let's get started with that so you can see in unity here we have our scene and we will just be leaving this now we're not going to be using it right away let's go into a lobby instead and shift into 2d mode here and focus in on our canvas and Cole I think we are ready for import here so let's go back on the browser that's it opening unity launch application and of course I will have a download link available to you in the description and then we can hit a download and I've already done that so I'm just going to hit import here and it will store everything in one single folder so you don't need to click off anything and hit import and basically it will import super quickly because it's pretty much only a few text files and a DLL or something so it's a very small file and we can clear the console here and you can see that we now have a new folder called database control and this comes with a readme that is very useful and actually quite easy to read so I definitely are recommend that you scroll through this if you have any questions there's also a way to contact the guy and yeah there's also a setup guide here so if anything changes from my video consult the readme cool so basically what he recommends you to do is to begin by going to window and then selecting database control free and you can see here that mine is currently loading and you can see that I've already set up my database if it says you haven't created the database yet simply hit create database and it should do that on its own I'm going to select that I want to use database 1 you get the possibility to have two databases using the free version one for each project so you can only have one in one project so I'm just going to be using database 1 here and you can see it says database set up and ready to go and now we can continue and you get a database ID which I will blur out and you have the possibility to empty the database so you can click this button at any point and it will remove all current users from that database and all that data it will completely empty it out so be careful with this option so I'll just empty mine right now in case I have something on that and you might get a an argument exception but it did empty it out I've gotten those don't know why it's happening but it is working so let's just close this down here so I don't have to play it for the entire video and what we can do now is we can go and find the demo scene under this csharp demo and this is frankly not a pretty scene if we double click to open it up but it does have some really cool things in here mainly under the menu control object it has this a DC demo menu control csharp script and this is basically just an example of how to use the API provided by the asset provided by the dll's that allows you to register users login get and send data to the database and it actually does work right off the bat so if we were to use this UI right here right now and see you hit play here and it tells you that you need to do the window thing first which we have done then we are able to try and log in so if I do something like test 1 2 3 and do the same for the password here and hit login it should say that there is no user at the moment username not found then we can register it all register again test one two three I'll do the same down here with the password and the confirm password and I'll register it'll take a moment to register the user and you can see that I'm now logged in and I'm able to send some data and get some data and the sending and getting data will not be looking at today we'll be focusing on the login menu itself so I'm now able to log out and then I'm able to log back in here so test one two three login and I'm now a registered user so I get back in here cool so what we'll be doing is we'll start by just using this demo script and we'll maybe edit it and we'll definitely edit it at a later point maybe even create our own if you want to create your own again the readme it's awesome everything is in there but I thought that we would just spider spice up this interface to make it fit our game a bit bedroom so what we'll do is we'll use this as a base so let's just duplicate this to keep the original and we'll call this one r1 actually let's just call this one log in there and we'll put this down with our other scenes and close database control folder here collapse that and then double click on that to make sure that you have that open you can see that up here and now we need to do a bunch of UI editing good so let's take a look at what we have under your canvas the first thing is our background and I thought we were just for consistency sake find the same background color as on our lobby here so let's find the background go to image copy the hex color go to login again go into canvas background and then copy the hex color in there so we'll get the same thing and the first thing that we are looking at here is the login menu and I just want to delete the important object here just the notice up here it's not important for us and then let's open up the login here and see what we have in here so we have a title we have some input fields with a few description are texts as well we have this text error which is basically just space for an error message if it if there are any errors that could be user not found or blank fields or stuff like that and then we have two buttons a locking and a register so let's just go ahead and actually disable this entire object for now and let's create our own so let's go right click create empty and let's scale this empty up so let's click and drag in one of the corners and hit down all or hold down alt to scale in both axes at once and we'll have it sit somewhere like there and let's make this a arm and it's going to be a vertical layout group as that will position things for us and we'll also call this log in here that's the new log in and we don't want to a force expand on the height and then we want to add a new element here which is going to be an input field and we want to drag that out and back in to have it snap correctly let's add component and then we are going to go layout element and let's select a preferred height of let's say 30 that works and everything else looks pretty good let's just rename this to user name and you can go input field or something I'm just going to call it user name and have the placeholder be user name and then a dot dot dot because that looks super cool and then what we will do is we will go to login and have this are aligned by the middle Center and I actually already like that a lot we'll also have the spacing be something like ten pixels so that when we make another element now there's a bit of distance between them so just duplicate that by hitting ctrl G or command D if you're on a Mac and this is going to be the password and we're going to change the placeholder text as well to password dot dot dot then we need two buttons we need one for register and one for login so let's right click on here go and let's actually make another empty object for this and I'll show you why this is cool in a second and let's make this a horizontal layout group so we can have the 2 buttons side by side down here and let's create another UI button undo that and let's drag it out and drag it back in something like that and let's add a component to this which is also going to be a layout element with a preferred height of 35 and let's go here and disabled child force expand on the height and you can see now that this is 35 tall and we can make this the let's make this the login button so login actually let's just add a button here so we are very clear about what's going on and this is going to say login cool and then we can duplicate that and call this the register register button and we'll edit the text on this as well so register like that and we can add a bit of spacing between them something like 5 pixels should be fine and you can see that see that we now have two input fields and two buttons and the last thing that we need to create is on the text object that will display any error messages if there is some so let's just rename this one two buttons and let's go right click on our login go UI text and let's find this text object it's up here again move it out move it back in it's kind of knowing you have to do that but you do and let's change the color here to some kind of red and I want don't want this to be too crazy but I do want it to be visible and clear that this is an error and let's make this italic just to make that super clear and let's just fill this in as error text and let's name it the same so texts and I think that is pretty much all we need to do for the login screen so now we need to we can just delete the previous login screen again you can go not by deleting everything as long as we have a copy here to use as reference and then we can select our menu control and I want to drag this to the very top and you can see we now have some missing fields so the first one is our login object itself that is the parent object there we go then we have a login input login username that is our input field username and our input field password and then we have the login error there which is just going to be the error text actually let me just rename that to login error text that's fine and that should be it and now we are actually already able to play that and we won't get any errors however our buttons won't work so we need to go in to our buttons find our login button I had an on click event drag in our menu control and then if you go on the function and find this script here and the naming on that script is a bit crazy but you will be able to find it we can go under login and you want this to be prefixed with login because it's under the locking menu and then login again so under the login we want to find the login button and that will make sure to call the appropriate function for when we want to login and then we'll do the same with the register button so add an onclick event drag in the game object and then go to login register button and that should actually be it so now we are able to use this UI here if we hit play and you won't get any errors and if I just hit login we'll get a field blank notice here and if I use test one two three and then on test one two three and hit login ah it should actually work and you can see transitions on to the next C so that is completely armed that is actually perfect so the next thing that we want to create is the loading screen as we just saw it so the loading screen here is currently very yellow and we don't want it to Yello at all so that's going and find the different elements here first off we have a text object I just want to bump down the size on this I think it's way too much let's go 24 and let's Center this on the vertical axis and let's also change the image here I definitely want to have them in the image here but I want to change it and make sure the scale is 1 1 1 so we only scale using the pixels and let's actually drag it out from the circle object and you can see this has a demo loading rotate script which basically just rotates on the image over time let's take that's actually copy this component remove the circle object and then I'll paste it onto the image instead here so let's paste component as new and that's going to be fine let's change this to positive 360 so we'll do a full rotation in one second I believe and let's change the source image on to use and if we just ctrl ctrl scroll you'll be able to see all of it the button reset that we get from our standard assets cross form cross platform input I think this works great as a loading icon so we'll just use that and sit native size and then we can just resize it here so I will also set the loading text to use a white color something like that and we can position it here in the center of the screen I think we're getting there actually I want that to be a lot smaller and of course you should play around with this more than I do however that looks fine to me for now at least that is totally usable so we'll just have those be in there and the references should still be set up just fine so that should now be a loading screen and we can just hit play here and it doesn't matter which one of these that you have enabled at the beginning it will go ahead and our configured properly and hit login here and you can see that the login our loading screen is not working properly so that's perfect I just noticed under our login here that we want to find our password input field and we want to go down here and change the content content type to password so that whatever we type in is invisible so that it will just be showing these stars there instead so that's perfect and we can disable the login screen and work on the register screen so you can see that this is all also kind of a UI mess but that's fine it's very easy for us to edit so let's use our current login screen as a base to work off so let's duplicate that that's called this one register as well let's enable it and basically we just need to add another field so let's duplicate the password field here and let's rename this to the confirm password and we'll change the placeholder here as well to confirm password dot dot dot cool and the buttons now should be register and back to note navigate back to the our login screen so we'll have a register element over here and then we'll have this be the back button so back button and we'll change the text on this to back and that should actually bid we also need a register arrow text and that is pretty much all we need to change however of course we need to set up the correct references so let's now delete the register pre our object that comes with the scene and let's set up our own here so first we need to set up the button on click events here so whit now on this shouldn't call login login button now this should call register back button and the register button should call register register button cool and that should be it and then we can choose our menu control we need to drag in the register parent object we need to drag in the register user name we need to drag in the register password and the register confirm password and then finally the register error so here the register error text and that should all be working out so if we hit play it will go to the login screen we can hit register we can go back so that's working hit register again and let's make a new user here that's called this on the odd test user and let's just do test user actually test user and test user and let's hit register it's going to load a little bit and it's going to log us in as test users so that is indeed working as well so the last thing that we need to change here is the actual locked in screen what gets displayed when we are logged in and of course we don't want the locked in screen we want to transition onto a lobby where we can join games and all that stuff but for now because we are just are kind of looking at our login system and our user system as an isolated entity and then we'll plug it into the game later let's just have the locking system in here and just have it display the most unnecessary information such as our username and a logout button so we'll just keep those two things so that's actually for this one just go in and edit it directly and what I want to do is I want to delete these two panels there are not needed for what we are doing so just delete those two lets on and let's delete the sent data button let's delete the umm let's see here so let's go through let's delete the title let's delete the info let's keep that locked in s and the username so text info 1 and 2 let's keep those let's delete text info 3 and text info 5 however we do want to keep text info for or else it will throw an error because this is referenced in menu control you can see it says text info for here so let's just go ahead and go ahead and disable this for the moment to avoid errors but to not have it clutter up the screen let's also find our input data here we can know that is also used let's just disable that as well the text error that's the same thing that's the lead or disable it and then we can remove the get data button so now we only have locked in s and then the username and a logout button and we'll delete the logout button and create that on our own so let's go UI button and let's I call this the I log out button and we just change the text on this to actually I'll write sign out here that is the new black and we can change the height of this button to select the button 235 to be consistent with our height and just drag it down a bit something like there that looks fine and then let's change of course the color of a lock in s let's also make this a lot smaller let's do something like maybe on 20 Center that on the vertical axis let's make it snap to the right here and let's just move that over scale that over so it snaps to the about the center of a button there and then let's find our user name here which is text info too and let's make that completely wide as well actually let's make this a bit more of a gray to really make our user name stand out and we can maybe even make this bold so it's very clear that this is an important piece of information and we can move this over just a tad as well and actually take both both of these and move them over just a tiny bit something like that so it's kind of centered and on that is all we need to do so now we can just rename this to locked in as text and this is the username text and that is pretty much all so now we can go to menu control and everything should still set up right there so let's now hit save and let's hit play and see if our system works so we know that we can register and all of that but now we can login as either test 1 2 3 or test users which are the two different users that we have registered and I'm just going to log in as test 1 2 3 so I'm going to write that both in the username and the password you can of course have a password that is different from the username which is definitely preferred then we can hit login here it's going to use our cool loading screen and it's going to say logged in as test 1 2 3 and then in some of the next videos what I will show what we will do there is we will create some data that will be able to persist between game sessions so between the scenes when you can log off you can sign back in at a later time and you will still have your progress in the game saved on the database guy's servers so that is super cool I think this plugins in is awesome for people who just want to get that game working and try some of this stuff out but maybe aren't PHP or my sequel expert so yeah that's pretty much all I wanted to show in this video I hope you thought that this was exciting I definitely did and without further ado thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video thank you so much to all of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in July and a special thanks to vixen famous own Andrew K and locks game TV these videos wouldn't be possible without you
