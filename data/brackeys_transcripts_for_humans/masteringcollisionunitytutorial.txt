00:02 - hello one will come to the mastering
00:05 - Coalition tutorial done by practice I am
00:08 - the CEO of practice and in this tutorial
00:11 - we are going to take a look at the
00:13 - different aspects of coalition inside of
00:16 - unity and in game development in general
00:19 - and how you can achieve really nice
00:22 - physics and coalition effects without
00:26 - being too harsh on your computer so
00:29 - we're going to take a look at the
00:30 - different methods and yeah it's going to
00:34 - be awesome so for this tutorial I have
00:36 - prepared a lot of stuff I have switched
00:40 - my window layout to the wide because I
00:45 - want to show you a whole lot of stuff
00:47 - that I've set up so all right we here in
00:51 - my mastering collision scene and the
00:54 - first thing we are going to take a look
00:56 - at is this and this is basically just a
01:01 - half sphere which I have extruded out
01:04 - and a ball that should fall upon it
01:07 - let's say that we want to have a game
01:09 - mechanic where this ball simply falls
01:13 - into this half sphere well if we just
01:19 - simply take this half speed it's fear
01:22 - imported into unity and create a sphere
01:26 - which we then apply a rigidbody the
01:30 - effect will look something like this the
01:34 - sphere Falls but it doesn't collide with
01:38 - the half sphere so I'm if we take a look
01:42 - at what components are attached to the
01:44 - different objects I'll just zoom in on
01:47 - the sphere here this fear has a
01:50 - rigidbody component this means that it
01:54 - will interact with different objects in
01:57 - the scene and different laws of physics
02:00 - for example the gravity which we can
02:03 - enable and disable here there are also
02:06 - other settings like mass drag
02:10 - angular drag and some constraints which
02:14 - will lock the the positioning and
02:19 - rotation of the sphere in different axes
02:24 - we ain't going to go into too much
02:27 - detail with this since this is not a
02:30 - physics tutorial this is more of a
02:33 - collision so alright so we have the
02:38 - rigidbody attached and of course we also
02:40 - have the sphere Collider because if we
02:43 - disable this it will simply fold through
02:47 - everything it won't be able to collide
02:48 - with anything so the collider is what
02:53 - decides is its like the shape of the
02:57 - object that will collide and the
03:01 - rigidbody is what makes it actually
03:03 - interact in the physics space so once we
03:08 - have so this ball is actually working
03:11 - correctly those are something wrong with
03:14 - our health a half sphere and this is
03:17 - because we haven't attached a Collider
03:20 - if we go ahead and click the add
03:24 - component and then physics we can attach
03:27 - different colliders let's try with a box
03:29 - Collider this creates a box around a
03:33 - sphere let's go ahead and play the game
03:36 - let's drag out the game view so we can
03:39 - see both the scene and the game view the
03:43 - ball in deeds hits the house fear but
03:46 - it's it only rolls off the surface so
03:50 - this Collider simply isn't detailed
03:53 - enough I'll go ahead and disable this
03:57 - one because I've made a right version a
04:00 - working version and let's see what's
04:04 - different so if we go over here in the
04:07 - right-hand side we can see that I have
04:08 - attached another kind of component this
04:12 - Collider is called a mesh Collider the
04:15 - mesh Collider will take the vertices
04:18 - from the real mesh which means the stuff
04:22 - you actually see in the scene and make a
04:26 - Collider of it this can be very taxing
04:29 - on your computer if you have many
04:32 - objects with mesh colliders and that if
04:34 - the objects are very detailed so this
04:37 - will get more and more advanced for the
04:40 - computer to calculate with more the more
04:43 - vertices you have but this is a way to
04:49 - actually achieve the kind of collision
04:52 - we have here so let's go ahead and hit
04:54 - play and see if it works the ball
04:58 - collides and it rolls into this century
05:01 - of our sphere just like it would in real
05:03 - life so that's basically how you would
05:08 - do complex collision in a moment we'll
05:12 - also take a look at how to achieve
05:14 - somewhat the same effect but making it a
05:18 - lot less taxing on the computer there's
05:22 - one more way to do this instead of just
05:25 - hitting the add component than physics
05:28 - and then importing the mesh Collider and
05:30 - choosing which one you could also simply
05:34 - go to where your imported the mesh so
05:38 - let's click the half sphere under the
05:42 - import settings there's a box called
05:44 - generate colliders and this will
05:46 - automatically generate may attach this
05:50 - mesh Collider to the object so for now
05:53 - let's go ahead and disable this section
05:56 - one and move on to section two
05:59 - I'll just reposition the camera so we
06:04 - can take a look at section two now we
06:09 - have quite a few things going on here we
06:12 - have some different boxes some different
06:16 - planes which are
06:18 - rigidbody boxes will then collide with
06:22 - let's take a look at how this works with
06:26 - the setup we have notice the
06:31 - reference they are set in the exact same
06:35 - position in the sack same rotation with
06:38 - the exact same size of a plane all the
06:42 - planes have box colliders attached all
06:44 - of these cubes are exactly the same they
06:48 - all have a rigidbody and a box Collider
06:51 - and then of course they are using the
06:53 - gravity though there's something
06:56 - different with these other than just the
06:58 - color these different boxes are using
07:03 - what is called a physics material you
07:06 - can insert a physics material once it's
07:09 - created under the Box Collider or just
07:13 - the collider in general right here under
07:16 - the material in this case I've inserted
07:20 - a ice material this means that this
07:26 - plane will from now on interact just
07:29 - like ice so when I hit the play button
07:31 - we can see that our box collides and
07:35 - then just slides down because ice is
07:38 - very slippery if we move on to the next
07:41 - one I've attached a metal physics
07:45 - material so this will interact just like
07:48 - metal no bounciness no slipperiness and
07:52 - the box just rolls off it and the last
07:57 - one I've attached the bouncy bouncy
08:01 - physics material so when we hit play the
08:05 - cube jumps off just like with the
08:07 - trampoline and this gives a very large
08:10 - control over the way that rigid bodies
08:14 - will interact with static objects or
08:16 - other rigid bodies so let's take a look
08:21 - at how you can create these kind of
08:24 - physics materials first of all if you
08:28 - just want to play around with it and get
08:30 - started it's a good idea to observe some
08:32 - already created physics material so
08:37 - let's download the standard assets
08:40 - physics material right click on the
08:42 - project pane hit the import package
08:45 - and here we can hit the physic materials
08:49 - this will make this folder appear under
08:53 - the standard assets I've just gone out
08:55 - and dragged it out so we can play with
08:57 - it right here on the in this folder you
09:01 - will find quite a few physics materials
09:03 - your frowned and find a bouncy one the
09:06 - one I used on the pink a nice one the
09:10 - one I used on the first one a metal one
09:13 - the one I used in the metal and then a
09:16 - wrapper and then wood now if we select
09:20 - for example the bouncy physics material
09:22 - we have quite a few things to change the
09:26 - bounciness is set to one this means that
09:29 - it will be as bouncy as can be if we
09:33 - change the if we drag this down a bit
09:36 - maybe at 0.25 let's see what happens so
09:41 - the cube does bounce a little bit more
09:43 - than normal but not all the way let's
09:46 - make it 0.5 you can see more bouncing
09:50 - there starts to appear and so on you can
09:52 - also adjust stuff like friction combine
09:56 - friction compound binds bounciness the
10:00 - direction of the friction and a lot of
10:03 - other variables I won't go into too much
10:05 - detail but have fun play around with it
10:09 - you can't basically you can't do
10:12 - anything wrong but it is a nice addition
10:15 - to the ordinary collision system so for
10:20 - now let's go ahead and disable this
10:22 - section alright I maybe forgot to tell
10:26 - you how do you create a physics material
10:28 - on your own you can simply go to the
10:31 - project pane hit the create and then
10:35 - physic material let's enable the last
10:41 - section I've made here it is and this is
10:45 - a model I very simple box model I
10:48 - created inside of Maya and this is
10:52 - pretty low poly though it could have
10:55 - been even simpler and you
10:58 - it could already it could always be more
11:04 - detailed so keep in mind that the
11:06 - methods we're going to be using here are
11:08 - for more detailed objects where the mesh
11:11 - Collider is simply too taxing on the
11:14 - computer first I have a example with
11:18 - collision gone wrong let's go ahead and
11:21 - hit play maybe just reposition the
11:24 - camera so you can have a look at what's
11:29 - happening hit the play button hmm that
11:37 - doesn't seem right this should be
11:39 - falling more to the left and a little
11:41 - forwards let's take a look look at what
11:45 - have gone wrong the collider we have
11:49 - attached to this game object
11:51 - it's a box Collider it's not detailed
11:54 - enough so we could instead attach the
11:58 - mesh Collider this would give beautiful
12:01 - collision though this could again be
12:03 - very taxing if this object was more
12:06 - detailed and had a lot of vertices and
12:08 - maybe round shapes let's go ahead and
12:11 - disable this and take a look at what I
12:13 - have done instead so here you can see a
12:17 - very detailed Collider that pretty much
12:21 - covers the whole object let's go ahead
12:24 - and just see if this works by hitting
12:26 - play indeed the weapon or whatever this
12:32 - is collides beautifully with the floor
12:36 - this is because I have made a series of
12:41 - ordinary colliders and combined them to
12:45 - create a nice working collider shape
12:49 - which is still not too taxing on the
12:52 - computer so let's go ahead and focus on
12:55 - the weird shape down here and if we
13:00 - expand this I have created a empty game
13:03 - object called colliders and under this
13:07 - I've parented all the different
13:10 - colliders I've created and this is just
13:12 - empty game objects with box colliders
13:15 - attached to them and together they
13:19 - create a whole shape around a model this
13:25 - could also be done with create by
13:27 - creating a series of other kinds of
13:29 - colliders you could make empty game
13:32 - objects storing colliders like the
13:37 - sphere Collider or the capsule Collider
13:40 - so on making your own colliders is a
13:44 - good way to still get nice physic
13:47 - interaction without without the computer
13:51 - having to do a lot of work so that's
13:54 - basically it for the mastering collision
13:58 - tutorial I hope this was helpful to you
14:00 - this is an introduction to collision
14:04 - though it covers pretty much all aspects
14:07 - of creating collision inside of unity
14:09 - and thank you for watching I'll see you
14:13 - in the next video
14:16 - you

hello one will come to the mastering Coalition tutorial done by practice I am the CEO of practice and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at the different aspects of coalition inside of unity and in game development in general and how you can achieve really nice physics and coalition effects without being too harsh on your computer so we're going to take a look at the different methods and yeah it's going to be awesome so for this tutorial I have prepared a lot of stuff I have switched my window layout to the wide because I want to show you a whole lot of stuff that I've set up so all right we here in my mastering collision scene and the first thing we are going to take a look at is this and this is basically just a half sphere which I have extruded out and a ball that should fall upon it let's say that we want to have a game mechanic where this ball simply falls into this half sphere well if we just simply take this half speed it's fear imported into unity and create a sphere which we then apply a rigidbody the effect will look something like this the sphere Falls but it doesn't collide with the half sphere so I'm if we take a look at what components are attached to the different objects I'll just zoom in on the sphere here this fear has a rigidbody component this means that it will interact with different objects in the scene and different laws of physics for example the gravity which we can enable and disable here there are also other settings like mass drag angular drag and some constraints which will lock the the positioning and rotation of the sphere in different axes we ain't going to go into too much detail with this since this is not a physics tutorial this is more of a collision so alright so we have the rigidbody attached and of course we also have the sphere Collider because if we disable this it will simply fold through everything it won't be able to collide with anything so the collider is what decides is its like the shape of the object that will collide and the rigidbody is what makes it actually interact in the physics space so once we have so this ball is actually working correctly those are something wrong with our health a half sphere and this is because we haven't attached a Collider if we go ahead and click the add component and then physics we can attach different colliders let's try with a box Collider this creates a box around a sphere let's go ahead and play the game let's drag out the game view so we can see both the scene and the game view the ball in deeds hits the house fear but it's it only rolls off the surface so this Collider simply isn't detailed enough I'll go ahead and disable this one because I've made a right version a working version and let's see what's different so if we go over here in the righthand side we can see that I have attached another kind of component this Collider is called a mesh Collider the mesh Collider will take the vertices from the real mesh which means the stuff you actually see in the scene and make a Collider of it this can be very taxing on your computer if you have many objects with mesh colliders and that if the objects are very detailed so this will get more and more advanced for the computer to calculate with more the more vertices you have but this is a way to actually achieve the kind of collision we have here so let's go ahead and hit play and see if it works the ball collides and it rolls into this century of our sphere just like it would in real life so that's basically how you would do complex collision in a moment we'll also take a look at how to achieve somewhat the same effect but making it a lot less taxing on the computer there's one more way to do this instead of just hitting the add component than physics and then importing the mesh Collider and choosing which one you could also simply go to where your imported the mesh so let's click the half sphere under the import settings there's a box called generate colliders and this will automatically generate may attach this mesh Collider to the object so for now let's go ahead and disable this section one and move on to section two I'll just reposition the camera so we can take a look at section two now we have quite a few things going on here we have some different boxes some different planes which are rigidbody boxes will then collide with let's take a look at how this works with the setup we have notice the reference they are set in the exact same position in the sack same rotation with the exact same size of a plane all the planes have box colliders attached all of these cubes are exactly the same they all have a rigidbody and a box Collider and then of course they are using the gravity though there's something different with these other than just the color these different boxes are using what is called a physics material you can insert a physics material once it's created under the Box Collider or just the collider in general right here under the material in this case I've inserted a ice material this means that this plane will from now on interact just like ice so when I hit the play button we can see that our box collides and then just slides down because ice is very slippery if we move on to the next one I've attached a metal physics material so this will interact just like metal no bounciness no slipperiness and the box just rolls off it and the last one I've attached the bouncy bouncy physics material so when we hit play the cube jumps off just like with the trampoline and this gives a very large control over the way that rigid bodies will interact with static objects or other rigid bodies so let's take a look at how you can create these kind of physics materials first of all if you just want to play
