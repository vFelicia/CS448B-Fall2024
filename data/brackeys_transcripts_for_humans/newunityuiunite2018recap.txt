00:00 - you night 2018 kicked off last week and
00:02 - man am i excited about some of the new
00:04 - features in this video we'll take a look
00:06 - at the biggest and most awesome changes
00:08 - that will be happening in unity in the
00:10 - near future with that said let's jump
00:12 - right into it and let's start small at
00:15 - least that's what unity did when they
00:17 - showed their improvements when it comes
00:18 - to deploying on really lightweight
00:20 - platforms such as messaging apps this
00:23 - might not sound like a big achievement
00:24 - but applying on a platform like this
00:27 - requires an extremely light build size
00:29 - and with the help of VCS it looks like
00:31 - unity has managed to compress the
00:32 - runtime to only 72 kilobytes which is
00:35 - just crazy small so I guess at least
00:40 - when it comes to gaming platforms moving
00:42 - on The Book of the Dead demo project is
00:44 - out and available for download and
00:45 - person is super excited to start playing
00:48 - around with it during the keynote unity
00:50 - also announced a new project they're
00:51 - working on called Mars the mixed and
00:54 - augmented reality studio Mars is a unity
00:57 - extension that as the name suggests
00:59 - allows you to create AR applications in
01:02 - unity an example of this could be using
01:04 - real-life objects as part of your game
01:06 - level they also did a live demo showing
01:08 - off the tools but as it sometimes
01:10 - happens with live demos it didn't really
01:13 - go according to plan on second try
01:20 - however they did get it working but I do
01:22 - think that issues like these speak to
01:25 - the fact that the general state of AR is
01:27 - still very early with that said I must
01:29 - admit that I was quite impressed with
01:31 - the facial tracking even with the live
01:33 - demo running in real time on stage the
01:35 - tracking seemed to hold up very well
01:37 - next up unity also gave some new
01:39 - information on nested prefabs apparently
01:41 - nested prefab is only part of a whole
01:44 - new prefab workflow this includes prefab
01:46 - mode prefab variants and of course
01:49 - nested prefabs you can definitely expect
01:51 - to see some content on this soon now
01:53 - what if you could create your game
01:56 - without worrying about setting up
01:59 - complicated animation rules creating
02:02 - transitions manually or creating nested
02:04 - state machines in answering this
02:06 - question
02:07 - unity is bringing machine learning into
02:09 - the world of animation
02:10 - with kinematic ax a new experimental
02:12 - package coming to unity later this year
02:15 - this system is able to figure out which
02:16 - animations to play based on player input
02:19 - and the player's position in the
02:21 - environment kinematic ekam binds
02:22 - fragments of the different animations
02:24 - you feed it to create seamless and
02:26 - dynamic motion in real-time they showed
02:29 - it off using some mocap data and I was
02:31 - actually really impressed with how
02:32 - smoothly it ran this is something that I
02:34 - definitely was not expecting but it's
02:36 - really interesting
02:37 - and now something unity has never done
02:40 - before changed their editor design the
02:44 - changes aren't huge but it definitely
02:45 - has a more modern flat UI also most of
02:48 - the icons of being changed it won't
02:50 - interfere with your workflow but it's
02:52 - definitely noticeable especially if
02:54 - you've been playing around in unity
02:55 - first long as I have and is it just me
02:57 - or did the free editor skin get even
03:00 - brighter finally you need to teach the
03:05 - new node based video effects editor a
03:06 - bit more still not much concrete
03:08 - information about the feature I'm just
03:10 - waiting impatiently to get my hands on
03:12 - it they did however mention that GPU
03:14 - particles will be part of it so that is
03:16 - definitely cool also following tradition
03:18 - unite contained a road map talk of the
03:20 - features that are coming to unity in
03:22 - this somewhat near future let me see how
03:24 - many of my favorites I can mention in
03:26 - under 40 seconds all right here we go
03:29 - new unified settings window and unified
03:31 - user Preferences window template games
03:32 - for networking starting with the FPS
03:34 - archetype shader graph support for HDR P
03:36 - starting in 2018 point two and in point
03:38 - three we will have note grouping as well
03:40 - round-tripping workflow with FBX export
03:42 - makes integration with maya maya LT and
03:44 - 3ds max much more convenient core
03:46 - terrain updates in 2018 point three
03:48 - include custom brushes better
03:49 - performance more script ability and more
03:52 - for 2d we get the brand-new 2d sprite
03:53 - shape tool in 2018 point two and point
03:56 - three will bring multi sprite support to
03:57 - character animation finally hexagonal
03:59 - tile is going to be a thing in 2018
04:01 - point two and in 2018 point three so is
04:03 - isometric tiles and to be honest this is
04:06 - just a snippet of all the cool stuff
04:08 - that were mentioned in the road map so
04:10 - to sum up lots of awesome improvements
04:12 - coming soon I'm a bit disappointed that
04:14 - many of these features aren't live as a
04:16 - preview just yet but again I guess we'll
04:18 - just have to be patient well of course
04:20 - try to cover each of these features as
04:22 - they are released on that thanks
04:24 - watching and I will see you in the next
04:25 - video thanks out the awesome patreon
04:27 - supporters who donated in June and
04:29 - especially thanks to Michael Neely
04:31 - Clinton fence Keira odd I mean Kuzco
04:32 - cheetah 3d Alexander player Tommy Kwan
04:35 - infinity PBR hand soft tune technophobe
04:37 - Jeff Olsen
04:38 - Sybok mummy Liotta set thanks along G
04:40 - Schneider Dennis Sullivan John Burkhart
04:42 - Superman the great Thomas body
04:44 - durkheim Scarface lemare five-car
04:45 - Jackson cool Swedish key Oh breezy James
04:48 - P team of whole debauch Larry tweed now
04:50 - Kiyosaki adrian has been approved cat
04:52 - Gregor appears Sweden Sweden of Erasmus
