00:02 - hello one number come to the 23rd
00:06 - tutorial in our survival game series in
00:08 - this one we are going to be taking a
00:10 - look at expanding our level so importing
00:14 - a lot of different models and assets and
00:18 - taking a look at how the the game will
00:21 - actually look and so I haven't figured
00:24 - out the title for this video yet but
00:26 - that's what we are going to do so
00:29 - everything we're going to be using in
00:31 - this video was made by a guy named Sam
00:35 - mean if I'm pronouncing that correctly
00:37 - really cool dude so I recommend you look
00:42 - him up if you're looking for any kind of
00:44 - nice and free assets on their Facebook
00:47 - page called 7 xf studios um if you're
00:52 - going to type in the URL and so you can
00:55 - see that he makes really cool looking
00:58 - models for example this one and if we
01:01 - just scroll up you can see that you can
01:03 - just type 7 xf space games so credit to
01:07 - him and especially considering how young
01:10 - he is I've also been told that he will
01:13 - model of things really cheap anyways
01:17 - moving on the tutorial that was the
01:19 - crediting shoutout pads now we are going
01:22 - to get actually actually get on with it
01:24 - so let's open up the survival asset pack
01:27 - which you will need for this unless
01:29 - you're going to be using your own models
01:31 - and then go to the import section and
01:34 - you can see that I have cleaned things
01:37 - up a bit the one we are going to be
01:39 - focusing on today is the start area so
01:42 - that's what we are going to be making so
01:45 - you can just go ahead and double click
01:46 - on that to see the different models
01:49 - organized in folders and so here is a
01:54 - really well done drawing of how the
01:57 - level will kind of look so keep in mind
02:01 - that I have trained a lot to make this
02:04 - drawing really um but anyway so I hope
02:10 - you're enjoying the skills here but on
02:12 - this
02:13 - how it's going to look so basically
02:15 - we're going to have the spawn here with
02:17 - like it's going to be like a basic camp
02:19 - so we're going to have a tent a make
02:22 - campfire and it's going to lead down
02:25 - with a road is going to lead down to the
02:28 - gate which is going to allow the plate
02:32 - to move on to the next area and that
02:34 - that's not something we're going to be
02:36 - creating today we have plenty of things
02:38 - that's neaten that needs to be done here
02:40 - and keep in mind this is just thoughts
02:43 - so we might not include everything but
02:46 - I'm thinking that over here we are going
02:47 - to have some like basic enemies to get
02:50 - the players started maybe we're going to
02:53 - make a quest system of some sort and
02:56 - then the hardened enemies are going to
02:58 - be down by the gate so that the player
03:01 - will have to level up before he can
03:03 - advance and so we have a river that runs
03:05 - through and maybe some kind of bus or
03:08 - hard map over here which will drop
03:11 - something on more valuable to the play
03:15 - and then we have a dungeon if we decide
03:18 - to go into a dungeon system at some
03:20 - point we'll see but that's just so you
03:23 - have an idea of what we're going to be
03:24 - making and this video will probably be
03:27 - split up into several parts but let's
03:31 - see about that so since this is a this
03:35 - is not perfectly square I have split it
03:39 - up into two squares so we're going to be
03:41 - making this terrain first and then
03:42 - focusing on this over here and that's
03:46 - because if you stretch out the terrain
03:47 - in unity by changing the resolution
03:51 - everything your paint will be stretched
03:53 - too and so things will start looking
03:55 - really weird so this is just a reference
03:58 - and now moving on again so the first
04:02 - thing we're going to be implementing is
04:05 - the camp fire so this run i really like
04:08 - and so if we go ahead and click into a
04:11 - camp fire folder we have two textures we
04:15 - have for the stone base and the actual
04:17 - locks of wood so that the to diffuse
04:21 - textures I'll actually just go ahead and
04:23 - rename that so
04:25 - we don't have the underscores just like
04:29 - it that way and then we have the
04:31 - campfire plenary file is so if you're
04:34 - using blender I recommend you just
04:35 - import using that and then we have the
04:37 - campfire FBX if you're not a blender
04:40 - user so you can just use that I'm going
04:44 - to export input this with blender if you
04:46 - don't have blender again I recommend you
04:48 - to just download it its usual it's very
04:51 - useful to have so dragged as always I've
04:55 - opened up unity and actually before we
04:59 - go ahead and drag it in let's just make
05:01 - sure that we can see things a little bit
05:03 - better because now this is set to night
05:06 - by default because of our time of day
05:08 - and so I think we should change that
05:10 - default value to be daylight so click on
05:15 - our target time of day and I'll also set
05:17 - down the speed so something like 600 and
05:21 - then we can go under that to our Sun so
05:25 - the Sun there and make sure this is set
05:28 - to pivot up in the corner it not century
05:31 - because then we're going to be rotating
05:33 - and shading around the moon so set that
05:36 - to pivot and then we can just make sure
05:38 - that the Sun is at a bit of an angle so
05:42 - it looks cool maybe even have the Sun
05:47 - come on so something like that and like
05:51 - that looks really good and we can also
05:54 - go ahead and change the time of day
05:57 - amount so this slider value here what it
06:00 - starts out with we can change that to
06:02 - something like 0.4 so now when we play
06:06 - the game you can see that it's daytime
06:11 - right when we played I'm actually going
06:14 - to do 0.3 instead and see if this is
06:18 - better yeah so like we have the Sun
06:21 - rising Ladouceur 0.35 so cool so now
06:28 - that we have a a pretty basic setting
06:30 - for that we can move on with the
06:32 - tutorial so undo our imports
06:37 - there we are going to just quickly
06:39 - organize this as it is organized in our
06:43 - imports in the assets pack so we are
06:47 - going to split this up into several
06:48 - folders so create a new folder call this
06:51 - weapons dragged in the yeah actually
06:58 - let's split this up too so create a new
07:00 - folder and then make this a sword have
07:05 - the sword and the sword texture and drag
07:07 - them in their new folder mace drag the
07:14 - mace and the UV text under there and
07:17 - then drag this these two folders to the
07:20 - weapons folders under the weapons folder
07:23 - so and let's then make one for the doors
07:27 - so folder door and yeah just go ahead
07:32 - and drag that in there perfect so now
07:35 - let's create actually let's not create
07:38 - the start area folder yet let's just
07:41 - experiment with it there so we don't
07:43 - have to like navigate a million of
07:45 - folders now go under the campfire fold
07:48 - again I know this is just a lot of
07:50 - browsing around but that's just how it
07:52 - is when you're making level design and
07:54 - again this tutorial is made because it
07:57 - has been requested so many times by you
07:59 - guys so let's take the campfire the
08:04 - large diffuse and the stone base diffuse
08:07 - and just drag them into unity under the
08:10 - imports folder you can see it importing
08:12 - and that we have it so we can take the
08:16 - campfire just maybe take a quick look at
08:20 - some of the settings here so we have the
08:24 - scale factory set to zero point to set
08:29 - one that might be good materials we want
08:33 - to import them normals import calculate
08:35 - we have no Rick so going to Rick and say
08:38 - none and hit apply to that and then to
08:43 - the mate animations
08:44 - uncheck import animation and so we
08:48 - should be good to go so if we just zoom
08:50 - in
08:51 - I'll play you here so you can get closer
08:53 - to the center of I scene then we can
08:57 - just take the campfire and drag it in
09:00 - there and I don't know about the scale
09:04 - yet it doesn't seem too bad but let's
09:07 - actually go ahead and now implement our
09:11 - textures on there so under the campfire
09:14 - you can see it has two objects a
09:16 - cylinder and is cylinder and the first
09:20 - one we're just going to rename to
09:23 - campfire locks and the other one is
09:28 - going to be campfire base and select the
09:35 - locks drag on the locks defuse and
09:38 - change the main color to completely
09:40 - white then do the same with the campfire
09:44 - base drag on the campfire the stone base
09:47 - diffuse and change it to completely
09:49 - white and now we can see that we have a
09:52 - nice looking fireplace so let's just
09:56 - drag it in there so we have it standing
10:00 - there and also let's go ahead and
10:02 - disable this these house walls since
10:05 - we're not really going to be using them
10:07 - for now and also the lamp if I can find
10:11 - it there so disable that so now it just
10:14 - looks a lot cleaner and let's take the
10:17 - house piece too and disable that and
10:19 - this one the test plate we can just go
10:22 - ahead and delete that so move our
10:25 - players so select our player and watch
10:27 - out whenever you select the player don't
10:30 - just click on him because then it will
10:32 - only select the graphics so when we
10:34 - start moving him the the other parts of
10:37 - the player will stay so so they'll
10:39 - select the entire play then drag him
10:42 - down and then drag him over to where you
10:46 - want him to be so let's see how this
10:48 - looks in game so at play and yeah the
10:52 - shading and the size is nice it might be
10:55 - a little too big so we can just select
10:57 - it in the scene at f/2 Center on it and
11:01 - then you should just be able to scale it
11:03 - down without moving
11:04 - because the anger point is set to pivot
11:07 - so something like that that might be too
11:10 - small actually not too bad maybe up a
11:17 - little bit so but again that's something
11:20 - you can set and decide for completely on
11:24 - your own you could also go ahead and
11:25 - drag this in to make it a prefab but I'm
11:27 - just going to make it let it be for now
11:29 - now let's create a new folder in our
11:31 - imports and call this fire place or
11:36 - campfire so stick to that and then
11:40 - select the model and the two textures
11:43 - and drag them in alright so moving on go
11:48 - to the start area folder in our survival
11:51 - assets and now let's go and find the one
11:55 - that says maybe ten Drake will go with
11:59 - that and if I just compare open this up
12:04 - in blender you can see what we have
12:05 - going on here so this is not an actual
12:08 - tent this is just the rake of it so like
12:11 - we have the different poles going across
12:14 - and such so this is just the skeleton
12:17 - and then we're going to be adding the
12:19 - cloth of this tent later on and I just
12:23 - thought I wanted to close it off these
12:25 - end pieces but you can go ahead and
12:28 - delete them that's why I've made them a
12:30 - separate object so let's just go ahead
12:34 - and select the ten Drake and the ten
12:36 - Drake diffuse and drag them into unity
12:39 - and unity will start importing now let's
12:43 - lend it select the ten Drake scale facts
12:46 - are set to one just looking good so
12:49 - let's go on to Rick say like none apply
12:53 - repeating myself go to animation uncheck
12:56 - import animation hit apply and there we
13:01 - have it so we can just go ahead and drag
13:02 - that in also and this size doesn't seem
13:06 - too bad I have hit F to focus on it and
13:10 - then let's expand this and I can see
13:15 - that this cylinder
13:18 - right here I think we can just go ahead
13:20 - and delete that yeah that's just an
13:23 - empty game object so the cylinder
13:26 - 0:03 you can just delete that that was
13:29 - just made for making it easier to model
13:32 - then we can have select the planes here
13:35 - drag on the ten drag the fierce change
13:38 - it to white and so now we should the
13:43 - share material
13:44 - which means that whenever each we change
13:46 - these plates it will also change the
13:51 - cylinders here so I'll just go ahead and
13:55 - delete the planes but that's completely
13:57 - up to you
13:58 - again so in another video we are going
14:01 - to be adding cloth to simulate the
14:04 - effects here so that we can complete our
14:08 - tent but for now we're just going to
14:09 - leave the rig so like that and that's
14:13 - actually rename the cylinder here to
14:17 - skeleton suite now let's move on so
14:24 - right click create folder and call this
14:27 - tent and then just select the ten rig
14:32 - and the ten Drake diffuse and drag it on
14:34 - the tent so save and let's go back and
14:39 - see what we can implement else so we
14:42 - have some stones which we could spread
14:45 - out we also have a street lamp so let's
14:48 - go ahead and maybe play around with that
14:50 - so go under the street lamp folder
14:52 - select the blend file select the street
14:56 - lamp cover diffuse the street lamp and
14:59 - the street lamp class diffuse now drag
15:05 - those into unity it will start importing
15:09 - select the street lamp model uncheck
15:13 - import animation wise they even
15:16 - animation I don't know and check that
15:19 - apply Rick none and we should be good to
15:24 - go subtract that in and this is maybe to
15:28 - back let's see if we just
15:31 - go over to that for me it seems to be
15:35 - way too back so we can just go ahead and
15:37 - either select it in the project pane and
15:41 - scale it down so change the scale factor
15:43 - or scale it down in in-game let's set
15:47 - try to set the scale factor to 0.5 and
15:50 - see how this looks this looks better to
15:55 - me and then we can maybe adjust the rest
15:57 - in games to make it a little bigger than
15:59 - that I don't want this to be like a big
16:02 - really big pole this looks pretty good
16:06 - and remember right now none of these
16:09 - models have actual texture or actual
16:12 - Collider is attached so you can just
16:14 - walk right through but we are going to
16:17 - add that later so now we can select the
16:21 - streetlamp go to the first cube and call
16:25 - this street lamp base so like this one
16:34 - and call this street lamp cover and I
16:43 - can see I'm missing eighty or so correct
16:46 - that and then select the cube zero zero
16:48 - one and actually that's the street lamp
16:51 - cover so we'll make change this just
16:54 - read lamp glass and then have the cube
16:58 - zero zero one be a street lamp cover so
17:08 - select the base and change the color to
17:11 - completely white drag on the street lamp
17:14 - diffuse select the cover change it to
17:18 - completely white drag on the street lamp
17:21 - cover and the straight length right a
17:24 - glass completely white and drag on the
17:27 - according texture so now we should see a
17:31 - nice-looking lamp here I of course you
17:36 - can always go ahead and play around with
17:37 - the settings for example I recommend
17:39 - that under the street lamp glass you
17:42 - change this from diffuse to something
17:44 - like on
17:45 - lid to make it look like it's actually
17:48 - glowing or maybe even self-illuminated
17:53 - diffuse that looks even better to me so
17:59 - that's really how this should look then
18:02 - let's go ahead and maybe add a add a
18:07 - light to this so you can go into unity
18:10 - and add a unity light so go on the game
18:13 - object create other and then point light
18:17 - drag it under our glass and then zero
18:22 - out the position so it now it should
18:24 - snap to the glass it doesn't snap
18:28 - exactly so let's move it over a bit to
18:33 - make sure it's inside and you can see
18:39 - the light coming onto the ground will
18:42 - change the color of the light to
18:44 - something a little bit more yellow just
18:48 - a tint and yeah this looks good maybe
18:52 - change the radius bump that up a bit and
18:55 - then the intensity a bit down so that
18:57 - something like 0.5 and now when we go in
19:00 - game because we have let the slider be
19:05 - we can make this night and see how it
19:09 - lights things up I think that looks
19:12 - pretty cool I'll actually go ahead and
19:15 - bump up the intensity even more so stop
19:19 - playing and like and then make it set it
19:23 - back to one maybe so when we go to night
19:28 - fall yeah it really lights things up
19:31 - this looks good and of course you can
19:34 - add the halo effect and such which are
19:37 - showed in the tutorial showing how to
19:40 - make lamps glow so apply some of the
19:45 - different techniques this is really
19:47 - about playing around with things and
19:49 - making it how you want it to be and all
19:52 - of these models are feel free to use
19:55 - them both commercially and
19:56 - non-commercially so that means
19:59 - anyway so let's rename this to street
20:02 - lamp light and collapse that and
20:08 - collapse that let's make a new folder
20:11 - call this street lamp and drag on the
20:16 - street lamp the street lamp cover yeah
20:18 - all the textures and drag them on there
20:21 - sweet now let's go back into the start
20:25 - area and see if there's any more we
20:27 - would like to implement right now maybe
20:30 - we should have a look at the fence so
20:33 - here we can go under the blend file and
20:37 - you can see that there are many
20:40 - different as one so let's just rename
20:43 - this to blender actually and you can see
20:47 - that we both have the ordinary fence so
20:49 - this is straight one and we also have
20:51 - different curvy fences so that if you
20:54 - would like the fence to follow a road
20:56 - you could use these on so there are
20:59 - large curves and slight curves to either
21:01 - side and for now I'm just going to use
21:05 - the ordinary fence or what let's see
21:08 - actually we might try with some curvy
21:12 - ones to follow this round now we'll just
21:14 - go with the ordinary front fence so
21:17 - let's open it up to see how it looks and
21:19 - I can see the texture is acting a little
21:22 - weird but you get the idea so let's drag
21:24 - this into unity and then go back to the
21:32 - fence texture year so let's just rename
21:34 - this to fence diffuse and all these
21:38 - renaming and stuff will probably already
21:40 - be done when you get the pack so just
21:43 - drag that into and we can see that this
21:45 - is working so select defense go on the
21:48 - rig none apply animation uncheck import
21:54 - animation apply and then you can drag
21:58 - this in hit F to focus on it and this is
22:01 - just a single game object so go into
22:04 - defensive material make this completely
22:06 - wide and then drag in defense diffuse we
22:11 - can see that this is look
22:12 - really nice so and this is also made so
22:16 - that it tiles perfectly which means that
22:19 - if you want like a really long fence you
22:21 - can just go ahead and duplicate it by
22:23 - hitting ctrl D or command D if you're on
22:26 - a Mac and then just dragging it over
22:29 - holding the ctrl key to make it snap and
22:33 - so we can just do this out in infinity
22:37 - so that it will tile nicely and there
22:41 - might be some problems with the lighting
22:43 - but it shouldn't be something that's
22:45 - really really noticeable so yeah that's
22:50 - it and you can of course always open
22:53 - this up in blender and make it snap
22:54 - yourself and make it into one object
22:56 - because that is a little more efficient
23:00 - when it comes to and being and not being
23:03 - too harsh on the computer so it's really
23:06 - it's really easier for unity to
23:08 - calculate one object and stiff it
23:11 - instead of a row of them even though
23:13 - it's exactly the same result so you
23:16 - could go ahead and do that but to make
23:19 - it easy you're just going to go with
23:20 - this solution for now so let's drag this
23:24 - over and maybe rotate it a bit and so we
23:28 - can have it sitting there and right now
23:31 - I'm just trying to get all the assets
23:33 - down on the terrain to see to scale them
23:37 - properly and get all of the the textures
23:41 - in there and the property set and so we
23:43 - can later on start making a new looking
23:47 - terrain and I'll probably time-lapse
23:50 - that and talk a blip a bit about of how
23:53 - I would design the level and how these
23:55 - should be used so on let's go ahead and
23:58 - make a folder for these called fence
24:03 - actually let's just make this fences so
24:06 - we can have all of the other fences in
24:08 - there too and so and let's go ahead and
24:14 - hit play oops not what's in the scene
24:19 - view so in the game view hit play walk
24:22 - over to it and this is maybe a bit
24:26 - small no that's fine let's just leave it
24:29 - there the rest of the models are not
24:32 - some I'm going to be implementing right
24:34 - now they are really nice though we have
24:37 - some we have a boat and we have it's not
24:43 - there right now but I should also import
24:46 - the bridge we have a really nice looking
24:49 - Chinese bridge so that will all be
24:52 - implemented once we get the the borders
24:57 - set up so the river that will run across
24:59 - so I think in the next video what I'll
25:03 - be doing is I'm going to be time lapsing
25:05 - me creating some terrain and talking
25:08 - over how I went about it and then I'm
25:11 - going to slow down the parts well where
25:13 - I import the assets so that you can see
25:15 - exactly what I'm doing so cool now let's
25:19 - just get on with this tutorial so let's
25:21 - add some colliders so I'll save this and
25:25 - the fire for the fireplace is something
25:28 - we're also going to be creating in a
25:30 - upcoming tutorial so we have a lot of
25:32 - tutorials coming up on the visual side
25:34 - now let's select the streetlamp and add
25:38 - a cool idea for this so let's just I
25:43 - don't know how detailed we want this to
25:45 - be let's see if we can reach the actual
25:48 - lamp okay we can we can jump up there so
25:55 - let's make a series of colliders that
25:57 - will make sure we can't collide with it
25:59 - and to know more about how we could add
26:03 - colliders to this you can watch our
26:06 - tutorial on mastering collision okay so
26:10 - let's go ahead and hit a game object -
26:14 - create empty and let's call this street
26:18 - lamp colliders colliders plural and drag
26:27 - that onto the street lamp and let's send
26:30 - you out the position so it should be
26:33 - based right down here and now let's add
26:36 - add some more empty game object sir
26:40 - create MT and drag it on there there and
26:45 - street lamp collider zero one and so on
26:52 - you so you can just make a lot of
26:54 - colliders - so let's make this a box
26:57 - Collider and drag it over and scale it
27:01 - up and so you get the idea so this is
27:04 - really just about fitting the model as
27:07 - good as you can without exaggerating I
27:11 - like little detail that's really not
27:14 - necessary and it's also something that
27:16 - will make it harder for the computer to
27:20 - calculate so really more detail than
27:23 - this is not needed so let's make it
27:27 - longer like that and maybe a little
27:30 - bigger to fit the base here so let's
27:34 - make it a little wider there and that's
27:39 - actually looking good so let's go ahead
27:41 - and duplicate that rename this to C Row
27:43 - two and scale this differently so we can
27:47 - have it moved up a bit and for example
27:52 - here I'm not going to make the one that
27:53 - goes across instead I'm just going to
27:56 - move make one big Collider that will
28:00 - take care of this entire pod right here
28:04 - so like that and then make it a bit
28:07 - smaller on that side that will take care
28:11 - of most of most of the collision use so
28:14 - if we just drag this down a bit move it
28:18 - over like that and then maybe yeah let's
28:24 - go ahead and make a separate Collider
28:26 - for the lamp too and then hit the add
28:31 - component out yeah it's already advanced
28:33 - or we can just scale it down move it
28:36 - over down to the lamp and I think it
28:40 - fits nicely so now let's try and hit
28:45 - play run over to the post here so you
28:49 - can see that really collides nicely so I
28:53 - can
28:54 - up there at least it stops me from doing
28:57 - it and yeah that's detailed enough for
28:59 - me you can always go ahead and fill
29:02 - around with it even more and if you
29:05 - really want the coalition to be 100
29:07 - percent perfect which I really do not
29:09 - recommend is then you can add a
29:13 - component under physics called mesh
29:16 - Collider which will simply make a
29:18 - Collider that that follows the mesh so
29:22 - the greater the graphics but again that
29:25 - is very taxing and so now just quickly
29:31 - speed the video up here so I'll just
29:34 - leave you a bit while I make the
29:37 - colliders for the other models so see in
29:40 - a sec
30:02 - all right so I'm back and I hope you
30:05 - enjoyed the little spit-up footage part
30:07 - there so this is what I got working so
30:10 - if we click on the fence you can see
30:12 - I've just attached a box Collider
30:14 - directly and it looks pretty nice if we
30:18 - look over you on the streetlamp you got
30:21 - that already so the ten Drake
30:23 - I haven't attached any colliders here
30:25 - since we're going to be messing around
30:27 - with clasp cloth physics and so we're
30:30 - going to need a more advanced Collider
30:32 - structure there so we'll just leave that
30:34 - be and under the campfire we have a
30:37 - large box Collider and then a smaller
30:39 - one down here for the base and so when
30:42 - we hit play now you should see some
30:46 - pretty nice collision going on there and
30:49 - for the fence and for the lamp and so
30:58 - that is pretty much it guys so you hope
31:00 - you enjoyed the video and hopefully it
31:04 - wasn't too repetitive and in the next
31:07 - one we are probably going to be taking a
31:09 - look at advanced expanding that's rain
31:12 - and making use of these so we're going
31:15 - to get creative with that so uh that's
31:19 - basically it I hope you enjoyed the
31:20 - video and I'll see you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

hello one number come to the 23rd tutorial in our survival game series in this one we are going to be taking a look at expanding our level so importing a lot of different models and assets and taking a look at how the the game will actually look and so I haven't figured out the title for this video yet but that's what we are going to do so everything we're going to be using in this video was made by a guy named Sam mean if I'm pronouncing that correctly really cool dude so I recommend you look him up if you're looking for any kind of nice and free assets on their Facebook page called 7 xf studios um if you're going to type in the URL and so you can see that he makes really cool looking models for example this one and if we just scroll up you can see that you can just type 7 xf space games so credit to him and especially considering how young he is I've also been told that he will model of things really cheap anyways moving on the tutorial that was the crediting shoutout pads now we are going to get actually actually get on with it so let's open up the survival asset pack which you will need for this unless you're going to be using your own models and then go to the import section and you can see that I have cleaned things up a bit the one we are going to be focusing on today is the start area so that's what we are going to be making so you can just go ahead and double click on that to see the different models organized in folders and so here is a really well done drawing of how the level will kind of look so keep in mind that I have trained a lot to make this drawing really um but anyway so I hope you're enjoying the skills here but on this how it's going to look so basically we're going to have the spawn here with like it's going to be like a basic camp so we're going to have a tent a make campfire and it's going to lead down with a road is going to lead down to the gate which is going to allow the plate to move on to the next area and that that's not something we're going to be creating today we have plenty of things that's neaten that needs to be done here and keep in mind this is just thoughts so we might not include everything but I'm thinking that over here we are going to have some like basic enemies to get the players started maybe we're going to make a quest system of some sort and then the hardened enemies are going to be down by the gate so that the player will have to level up before he can advance and so we have a river that runs through and maybe some kind of bus or hard map over here which will drop something on more valuable to the play and then we have a dungeon if we decide to go into a dungeon system at some point we'll see but that's just so you have an idea of what we're going to be making and this video will probably be split up into several parts but let's see about that so since this is a this is not perfectly square I have split it up into two squares so we're going to be making this terrain first and then focusing on this over here and that's because if you stretch out the terrain in unity by changing the resolution everything your paint will be stretched too and so things will start looking really weird so this is just a reference and now moving on again so the first thing we're going to be implementing is the camp fire so this run i really like and so if we go ahead and click into a camp fire folder we have two textures we have for the stone base and the actual locks of wood so that the to diffuse textures I'll actually just go ahead and rename that so we don't have the underscores just like it that way and then we have the campfire plenary file is so if you're using blender I recommend you just import using that and then we have the campfire FBX if you're not a blender user so you can just use that I'm going to export input this with blender if you don't have blender again I recommend you to just download it its usual it's very useful to have so dragged as always I've opened up unity and actually before we go ahead and drag it in let's just make sure that we can see things a little bit better because now this is set to night by default because of our time of day and so I think we should change that default value to be daylight so click on our target time of day and I'll also set down the speed so something like 600 and then we can go under that to our Sun so the Sun there and make sure this is set to pivot up in the corner it not century because then we're going to be rotating and shading around the moon so set that to pivot and then we can just make sure that the Sun is at a bit of an angle so it looks cool maybe even have the Sun come on so something like that and like that looks really good and we can also go ahead and change the time of day amount so this slider value here what it starts out with we can change that to something like 0.4 so now when we play the game you can see that it's daytime right when we played I'm actually going to do 0.3 instead and see if this is better yeah so like we have the Sun rising Ladouceur 0.35 so cool so now that we have a a pretty basic setting for that we can move on with the tutorial so undo our imports there we are going to just quickly organize this as it is organized in our imports in the assets pack so we are going to split this up into several folders so create a new folder call this weapons dragged in the yeah actually let's split this up too so create a new folder and then make this a sword have the sword and the sword texture and drag them in their new folder mace drag the mace and the UV text under there and then drag this these two folders to the weapons folders under the weapons folder so and let's then make one for the doors so folder door and yeah just go ahead and drag that in there perfect so now let's create actually let's not create the start area folder yet let's just experiment with it there so we don't have to like navigate a million of folders now go under the campfire fold again I know this is just a lot of browsing around but that's just how it is when you're making level design and again this tutorial is made because it has been requested so many times by you guys so let's take the campfire the large diffuse and the stone base diffuse and just drag them into unity under the imports folder you can see it importing and that we have it so we can take the campfire just maybe take a quick look at some of the settings here so we have the scale factory set to zero point to set one that might be good materials we want to import them normals import calculate we have no Rick so going to Rick and say none and hit apply to that and then to the mate animations uncheck import animation and so we should be good to go so if we just zoom in I'll play you here so you can get closer to the center of I scene then we can just take the campfire and drag it in there and I don't know about the scale yet it doesn't seem too bad but let's actually go ahead and now implement our textures on there so under the campfire you can see it has two objects a cylinder and is cylinder and the first one we're just going to rename to campfire locks and the other one is going to be campfire base and select the locks drag on the locks defuse and change the main color to completely white then do the same with the campfire base drag on the campfire the stone base diffuse and change it to completely white and now we can see that we have a nice looking fireplace so let's just drag it in there so we have it standing there and also let's go ahead and disable this these house walls since we're not really going to be using them for now and also the lamp if I can find it there so disable that so now it just looks a lot cleaner and let's take the house piece too and disable that and this one the test plate we can just go ahead and delete that so move our players so select our player and watch out whenever you select the player don't just click on him because then it will only select the graphics so when we start moving him the the other parts of the player will stay so so they'll select the entire play then drag him down and then drag him over to where you want him to be so let's see how this looks in game so at play and yeah the shading and the size is nice it might be a little too big so we can just select it in the scene at f/2 Center on it and then you should just be able to scale it down without moving because the anger point is set to pivot so something like that that might be too small actually not too bad maybe up a little bit so but again that's something you can set and decide for completely on your own you could also go ahead and drag this in to make it a prefab but I'm just going to make it let it be for now now let's create a new folder in our imports and call this fire place or campfire so stick to that and then select the model and the two textures and drag them in alright so moving on go to the start area folder in our survival assets and now let's go and find the one that says maybe ten Drake will go with that and if I just compare open this up in blender you can see what we have going on here so this is not an actual tent this is just the rake of it so like we have the different poles going across and such so this is just the skeleton and then we're going to be adding the cloth of this tent later on and I just thought I wanted to close it off these end pieces but you can go ahead and delete them that's why I've made them a separate object so let's just go ahead and select the ten Drake and the ten Drake diffuse and drag them into unity and unity will start importing now let's lend it select the ten Drake scale facts are set to one just looking good so let's go on to Rick say like none apply repeating myself go to animation uncheck import animation hit apply and there we have it so we can just go ahead and drag that in also and this size doesn't seem too bad I have hit F to focus on it and then let's expand this and I can see that this cylinder right here I think we can just go ahead and delete that yeah that's just an empty game object so the cylinder 003 you can just delete that that was just made for making it easier to model then we can have select the planes here drag on the ten drag the fierce change it to white and so now we should the share material which means that whenever each we change these plates it will also change the cylinders here so I'll just go ahead and delete the planes but that's completely up to you again so in another video we are going to be adding cloth to simulate the effects here so that we can complete our tent but for now we're just going to leave the rig so like that and that's actually rename the cylinder here to skeleton suite now let's move on so right click create folder and call this tent and then just select the ten rig and the ten Drake diffuse and drag it on the tent so save and let's go back and see what we can implement else so we have some stones which we could spread out we also have a street lamp so let's go ahead and maybe play around with that so go under the street lamp folder select the blend file select the street lamp cover diffuse the street lamp and the street lamp class diffuse now drag those into unity it will start importing select the street lamp model uncheck import animation wise they even animation I don't know and check that apply Rick none and we should be good to go subtract that in and this is maybe to back let's see if we just go over to that for me it seems to be way too back so we can just go ahead and either select it in the project pane and scale it down so change the scale factor or scale it down in ingame let's set try to set the scale factor to 0.5 and see how this looks this looks better to me and then we can maybe adjust the rest in games to make it a little bigger than that I don't want this to be like a big really big pole this looks pretty good and remember right now none of these models have actual texture or actual Collider is attached so you can just walk right through but we are going to add that later so now we can select the streetlamp go to the first cube and call this street lamp base so like this one and call this street lamp cover and I can see I'm missing eighty or so correct that and then select the cube zero zero one and actually that's the street lamp cover so we'll make change this just read lamp glass and then have the cube zero zero one be a street lamp cover so select the base and change the color to completely white drag on the street lamp diffuse select the cover change it to completely white drag on the street lamp cover and the straight length right a glass completely white and drag on the according texture so now we should see a nicelooking lamp here I of course you can always go ahead and play around with the settings for example I recommend that under the street lamp glass you change this from diffuse to something like on lid to make it look like it's actually glowing or maybe even selfilluminated diffuse that looks even better to me so that's really how this should look then let's go ahead and maybe add a add a light to this so you can go into unity and add a unity light so go on the game object create other and then point light drag it under our glass and then zero out the position so it now it should snap to the glass it doesn't snap exactly so let's move it over a bit to make sure it's inside and you can see the light coming onto the ground will change the color of the light to something a little bit more yellow just a tint and yeah this looks good maybe change the radius bump that up a bit and then the intensity a bit down so that something like 0.5 and now when we go in game because we have let the slider be we can make this night and see how it lights things up I think that looks pretty cool I'll actually go ahead and bump up the intensity even more so stop playing and like and then make it set it back to one maybe so when we go to night fall yeah it really lights things up this looks good and of course you can add the halo effect and such which are showed in the tutorial showing how to make lamps glow so apply some of the different techniques this is really about playing around with things and making it how you want it to be and all of these models are feel free to use them both commercially and noncommercially so that means anyway so let's rename this to street lamp light and collapse that and collapse that let's make a new folder call this street lamp and drag on the street lamp the street lamp cover yeah all the textures and drag them on there sweet now let's go back into the start area and see if there's any more we would like to implement right now maybe we should have a look at the fence so here we can go under the blend file and you can see that there are many different as one so let's just rename this to blender actually and you can see that we both have the ordinary fence so this is straight one and we also have different curvy fences so that if you would like the fence to follow a road you could use these on so there are large curves and slight curves to either side and for now I'm just going to use the ordinary fence or what let's see actually we might try with some curvy ones to follow this round now we'll just go with the ordinary front fence so let's open it up to see how it looks and I can see the texture is acting a little weird but you get the idea so let's drag this into unity and then go back to the fence texture year so let's just rename this to fence diffuse and all these renaming and stuff will probably already be done when you get the pack so just drag that into and we can see that this is working so select defense go on the rig none apply animation uncheck import animation apply and then you can drag this in hit F to focus on it and this is just a single game object so go into defensive material make this completely wide and then drag in defense diffuse we can see that this is look really nice so and this is also made so that it tiles perfectly which means that if you want like a really long fence you can just go ahead and duplicate it by hitting ctrl D or command D if you're on a Mac and then just dragging it over holding the ctrl key to make it snap and so we can just do this out in infinity so that it will tile nicely and there might be some problems with the lighting but it shouldn't be something that's really really noticeable so yeah that's it and you can of course always open this up in blender and make it snap yourself and make it into one object because that is a little more efficient when it comes to and being and not being too harsh on the computer so it's really it's really easier for unity to calculate one object and stiff it instead of a row of them even though it's exactly the same result so you could go ahead and do that but to make it easy you're just going to go with this solution for now so let's drag this over and maybe rotate it a bit and so we can have it sitting there and right now I'm just trying to get all the assets down on the terrain to see to scale them properly and get all of the the textures in there and the property set and so we can later on start making a new looking terrain and I'll probably timelapse that and talk a blip a bit about of how I would design the level and how these should be used so on let's go ahead and make a folder for these called fence actually let's just make this fences so we can have all of the other fences in there too and so and let's go ahead and hit play oops not what's in the scene view so in the game view hit play walk over to it and this is maybe a bit small no that's fine let's just leave it there the rest of the models are not some I'm going to be implementing right now they are really nice though we have some we have a boat and we have it's not there right now but I should also import the bridge we have a really nice looking Chinese bridge so that will all be implemented once we get the the borders set up so the river that will run across so I think in the next video what I'll be doing is I'm going to be time lapsing me creating some terrain and talking over how I went about it and then I'm going to slow down the parts well where I import the assets so that you can see exactly what I'm doing so cool now let's just get on with this tutorial so let's add some colliders so I'll save this and the fire for the fireplace is something we're also going to be creating in a upcoming tutorial so we have a lot of tutorials coming up on the visual side now let's select the streetlamp and add a cool idea for this so let's just I don't know how detailed we want this to be let's see if we can reach the actual lamp okay we can we can jump up there so let's make a series of colliders that will make sure we can't collide with it and to know more about how we could add colliders to this you can watch our tutorial on mastering collision okay so let's go ahead and hit a game object create empty and let's call this street lamp colliders colliders plural and drag that onto the street lamp and let's send you out the position so it should be based right down here and now let's add add some more empty game object sir create MT and drag it on there there and street lamp collider zero one and so on you so you can just make a lot of colliders so let's make this a box Collider and drag it over and scale it up and so you get the idea so this is really just about fitting the model as good as you can without exaggerating I like little detail that's really not necessary and it's also something that will make it harder for the computer to calculate so really more detail than this is not needed so let's make it longer like that and maybe a little bigger to fit the base here so let's make it a little wider there and that's actually looking good so let's go ahead and duplicate that rename this to C Row two and scale this differently so we can have it moved up a bit and for example here I'm not going to make the one that goes across instead I'm just going to move make one big Collider that will take care of this entire pod right here so like that and then make it a bit smaller on that side that will take care of most of most of the collision use so if we just drag this down a bit move it over like that and then maybe yeah let's go ahead and make a separate Collider for the lamp too and then hit the add component out yeah it's already advanced or we can just scale it down move it over down to the lamp and I think it fits nicely so now let's try and hit play run over to the post here so you can see that really collides nicely so I can up there at least it stops me from doing it and yeah that's detailed enough for me you can always go ahead and fill around with it even more and if you really want the coalition to be 100 percent perfect which I really do not recommend is then you can add a component under physics called mesh Collider which will simply make a Collider that that follows the mesh so the greater the graphics but again that is very taxing and so now just quickly speed the video up here so I'll just leave you a bit while I make the colliders for the other models so see in a sec all right so I'm back and I hope you enjoyed the little spitup footage part there so this is what I got working so if we click on the fence you can see I've just attached a box Collider directly and it looks pretty nice if we look over you on the streetlamp you got that already so the ten Drake I haven't attached any colliders here since we're going to be messing around with clasp cloth physics and so we're going to need a more advanced Collider structure there so we'll just leave that be and under the campfire we have a large box Collider and then a smaller one down here for the base and so when we hit play now you should see some pretty nice collision going on there and for the fence and for the lamp and so that is pretty much it guys so you hope you enjoyed the video and hopefully it wasn't too repetitive and in the next one we are probably going to be taking a look at advanced expanding that's rain and making use of these so we're going to get creative with that so uh that's basically it I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll see you in the next one
