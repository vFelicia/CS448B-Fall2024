00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to this video in
00:05 - creating a multiplayer FPS in unity
00:07 - today we are going to be creating a
00:08 - pause menu that will allow us to leave
00:11 - the room we're currently in so we will
00:13 - disconnect from the server also we'll be
00:15 - upgrading the entire project 25.4 fixing
00:19 - a bunch of issues that we were having
00:21 - before that you might not have noticed
00:23 - but that I ran into when trying to
00:26 - prepare for this video so I tried to
00:28 - make some functionality for
00:30 - disconnecting from a room and unity gave
00:33 - me a bunch of errors even for the
00:35 - simplest of stuff stuff like
00:36 - disconnecting from some kind of server
00:39 - and then connecting back in if you
00:41 - weren't the host in the first place and
00:42 - it would just throw an error it simply
00:45 - wouldn't work and I went on to the
00:47 - forums and people were getting mad and
00:49 - it was all kind of crazy and then I
00:51 - updated and everything is solved thank
00:55 - you so that will be working something
00:58 - that more advanced like whose migration
01:01 - is not something we'll be looking at
01:02 - today because it's actually not
01:04 - supported yet using the Unity matchmaker
01:06 - but when it is we will definitely have a
01:09 - look at it so without further ado let's
01:12 - dive right into today's video so you can
01:15 - see that I'm here in a unity 5.4 and
01:18 - right off the bat you will get some
01:20 - errors that's because unity has made
01:22 - some API changes so let's just go ahead
01:24 - and double click on the first error here
01:26 - and it will take us here and what I have
01:29 - used here to figure out kind of what how
01:31 - to write things is a very useful little
01:33 - guide unity has made in that
01:35 - documentation so you can search for that
01:37 - or input the URL here I will try and
01:40 - remember and put it in the description
01:41 - and I'm simply under working in unity
01:44 - upgrade guides and then upgrading to
01:46 - unity 5.4 under the API changes and it
01:50 - basically states how things were on
01:52 - before 5.4 and how they are now so it
01:56 - allows you to very quickly just add some
01:58 - things to a code you can see here that
02:00 - before we use the network ID and then we
02:03 - input it an empty string and then a
02:05 - callback method now we just need to do a
02:08 - bunch more into strings and to see ropes
02:11 - so if we go in here on
02:13 - the matchmaker dot this is list matches
02:17 - I wanted to find the joint match down
02:19 - here so we put in the network ID we put
02:22 - in an empty string there another empty
02:26 - string another interesting 0 and then 0
02:29 - and you can of course read what these
02:31 - variables are doing here so that should
02:34 - work now also match description and it
02:37 - also states this in the guide is now
02:39 - called
02:39 - match info snapshot don't ask me why
02:44 - they would change it to such a name but
02:46 - they have so just change that all over
02:49 - mmm
02:50 - cool then we don't use then we find the
02:55 - match maker list matches and this has
02:57 - changed as well so let's go in here and
02:59 - search for list matches and we can see
03:03 - that this now takes in a trooper a MIDI
03:06 - parameter and a 0 and then 0 so we'll
03:09 - just do comma true comma zero comma zero
03:13 - and again you can read what that does
03:15 - right here and then the callback method
03:18 - has changed we don't use the lit list
03:22 - match response anymore instead instead
03:25 - we use a pool whether or not it was a
03:27 - success we use a string with the
03:33 - extended info so string extended info
03:37 - and finally a list of matching phone app
03:41 - shots so a list of match info snapshots
03:45 - which we are just going to call match
03:47 - list and then of course here we check if
03:51 - match list is equal to null well we also
03:54 - want to check now and you might be able
03:56 - to get away with only doing this but I'm
03:58 - just going to leave both in if it wasn't
04:01 - a success well then we couldn't get the
04:03 - room this time we returned great and
04:06 - down here for each match info snapshot
04:09 - match in match list there we go we don't
04:13 - need that matches and then we set up the
04:18 - match here and that is the match info
04:22 - snapshot and the join room I think
04:24 - that's correct but we need to go in and
04:26 - edit this
04:27 - method here so if we go down here and
04:29 - lower into unity and find the room list
04:33 - item we can go ahead and double click on
04:35 - that and we need to change this to a
04:37 - match info snapshot duplicate that over
04:41 - there and over there and now we should
04:44 - stop getting errors from those two
04:47 - scripts and then we only have to change
04:49 - one thing inside of our host game script
04:51 - so double click on that and that is the
04:53 - actual create match method here and
04:56 - again we'll just reference our manual
04:59 - and if we find the create match there so
05:05 - before it was this short now it is of
05:07 - course longer so two more strings and
05:10 - two more integers so we'll put on string
05:14 - a string and integer an integer and that
05:19 - should indeed be working and I think I
05:23 - think that was it so if we go back into
05:26 - unity here you can see that we are now
05:28 - error-free whoa we weren't error-free
05:31 - but I actually got rid of them I think
05:35 - what that was is that I got some weird
05:39 - error messages that simply disappeared
05:44 - when I restarted unity and it looks like
05:47 - this might have been the same so when we
05:50 - are not getting getting any sticky
05:51 - sticky errors it's simply most of the
05:54 - time just an edited thing on that unity
05:57 - just well it's not important to us and
05:59 - they will take care of it so things are
06:02 - working now so that's great
06:03 - and we can go ahead and actually expand
06:05 - upon our game so what I want to do is I
06:08 - want to go into our main level and
06:10 - basically in here when we play what we
06:13 - do is we instantiate a prefab called
06:16 - player UI and this is where I want to
06:18 - add our actual pause menu so if we go
06:21 - and drag our player UI in here so we can
06:23 - edit it and then go on to UI and panel
06:27 - and just reset this and make sure it
06:30 - scales to the entire screen I'm going to
06:32 - remove the background here and I'm going
06:34 - to tin this our black so that it will
06:37 - kind of wash out the background so we
06:39 - can have some
06:40 - we're elements on top of this I'm going
06:44 - to rename this to the pause menu and
06:47 - then let's right-click on that go on the
06:50 - UI and add a button and this button is
06:53 - of course going to be the leave room
06:55 - button so let's make this very dramatic
06:57 - let's make it very red and let's go
07:01 - under your text here and call this leave
07:03 - room let's bump up the size to something
07:07 - like 20 maybe let's make it white and
07:12 - let's make it bold something like that I
07:16 - mean it's not the prettiest thing in the
07:18 - world but it gets the job done you can
07:21 - try and maybe actually I like it
07:24 - complete the square there or do I know I
07:28 - don't so this is fine and again you
07:30 - should play around more with these UI
07:32 - elements I just don't have time for it
07:35 - here so this is our leave room button
07:37 - and that's perfect so now we can go
07:40 - ahead and add a new component to this
07:42 - and this is going to be the pause game
07:44 - script or it pause pause menu and this
07:49 - will take care of everything related to
07:51 - the pause menu such as the leave room
07:53 - button and I'm just going to double
07:55 - click this to open it up in Visual
07:56 - Studio just so we have it here and you
07:59 - can see all of these warnings are
08:00 - related to the cross-platform
08:02 - input of the standard asset spec they're
08:05 - really non important so we can just go
08:07 - ahead and hit clear and then on side
08:11 - inside of a play UI if we double click
08:13 - that what I want to do here is I want to
08:15 - be able to toggle on and off our pass
08:18 - menu by using the Escape key so undo our
08:21 - update method we will check if input dot
08:25 - get key down and the key that we want to
08:29 - check for is the key code dot escape so
08:34 - if we've pressed the escape key we want
08:36 - to toggle on the pause menu let's now
08:43 - create a function for this so void
08:45 - charcoal pause menu
08:50 - and we need of course the reference to a
08:53 - pause menu so we're going to make this a
08:54 - serialize filled and this is going to be
08:56 - of type game object and we're going to
08:58 - call it pause menu so we can reference
09:01 - this in the inspector and then we say
09:03 - pause menu dot set active and we want it
09:07 - the active state to be the opposite of
09:09 - what it currently is so if it's on we
09:12 - want it off if it's off we want it on
09:13 - and therefore we can simply use pause
09:16 - menu dot active self to get the current
09:20 - active state of the object cool so that
09:24 - will enable and disable it what I also
09:26 - want to do is have some kind of static
09:29 - variable that is easily accessible
09:31 - accessible from within the other scripts
09:34 - that will allow us to easily check if
09:36 - the upgrade or if the pause menu is
09:39 - enabled well then we don't want to be
09:42 - able to shoot we don't want to be able
09:43 - to move or look around stuff like that
09:46 - we can simply use this static variable
09:49 - inside of other scripts so if we go into
09:51 - the pass menu here I'm just going to
09:53 - make a public static bowl code is on and
10:01 - we'll just default that to false and
10:03 - then inside of our player UI we can set
10:06 - pass menu dot is on equal to the new
10:13 - state of our pass menu there we go and
10:17 - we can also make sure that pass menu
10:19 - that is on is set to false in the start
10:25 - method oops so pause menu oops
10:33 - pause menu dot is on equals false when
10:38 - we are starting your game cool so this
10:42 - won't disable anything but it will
10:45 - toggle on and off the pause menu so if
10:48 - we just toggle that off from the
10:50 - beginning and hit up and of course drag
10:53 - it in there hit apply and delete that
10:56 - and then we go into our save that go
11:01 - into our lobby
11:03 - and host a new game and this is just
11:05 - going to be a test hit create room and
11:08 - then hit escape nothing happens and why
11:13 - is this so if we find our player UI here
11:16 - we have the pause menu and for some
11:21 - reason it's not toggling and that's
11:24 - because we want it to be the opposite of
11:26 - its current active self so of course
11:29 - that makes more sense so let's try and
11:32 - hit a play here you can see the room
11:34 - hasn't been cleaned up yet but it will
11:36 - in a moment that's my phone going off so
11:38 - just just a moment
11:40 - whoops sorry about that too many things
11:42 - happening at once so we can go ahead and
11:44 - create a new room here just call it room
11:48 - and now when we hit escape you can see
11:51 - that it pops up and when you hit escape
11:53 - again it disappears cool and so what we
11:56 - want to do now is make sure that we
11:58 - don't move when it pops up and that we
12:01 - don't shoot while it's popped up so to
12:04 - do this we find our player prefab and we
12:07 - find I'll play a shoot script and we go
12:10 - in here under our update method and add
12:12 - a little if statement we simply say if
12:15 - pause menu dot is on well then we can
12:19 - simply return then we don't want to do
12:21 - anything with the shooting mechanics and
12:24 - we can go in and do the same thing with
12:27 - our player controller so if we go into a
12:29 - player controller under the update
12:31 - method right in the beginning if pause
12:33 - menu dot is on then we return and that
12:38 - should actually be all we need to do
12:40 - here so if we hit play again
12:42 - and create a new room here so test room
12:48 - create room and hit escape you can see
12:51 - that we cannot move or shoot and if I
12:56 - toggle it back off we can move and
12:58 - shooting it so that's perfect so the
13:00 - next thing that we want to do is make
13:02 - our a leave room button actually do
13:05 - something and we do this from within the
13:07 - pause menu script so if we double click
13:09 - here we're going to make a new method
13:12 - here a public board called leave room
13:16 - and all this is pretty much going to do
13:19 - is call some functions on the network
13:21 - manager so in order to do that we need
13:24 - to be using unity engine dot networking
13:28 - and it would be a good idea to store a
13:32 - temporary reference to our network
13:35 - manager so let's go up here and make a
13:38 - private network manager and let's just
13:42 - call this well we could just call it
13:46 - network manager let's just do that we
13:48 - could also just call it nm for short
13:50 - let's do the full name here network
13:52 - manager there we go and then inside of
13:55 - our start method is where we will set
13:57 - network manager equal to network manager
14:00 - dot singleton cool and this is just an
14:06 - easier way of writing things out so our
14:08 - code down here won't get very long and
14:11 - then a network manager dot match maker
14:15 - dot drop connection so we want to tell
14:19 - on matchmaker
14:20 - that it should drop the connection to
14:22 - this client and we do that by using
14:26 - network manager dot match info and we
14:30 - want to get multiple things from this
14:32 - match info so that story that so let's
14:34 - make a match or a match info dot let me
14:40 - just see the type of this match info
14:42 - here so this is a match info yon so what
14:47 - we need to do up here is say using unity
14:50 - engine done networking dot match and now
14:54 - we should be able to store a match info
14:56 - here exactly and just call this match
15:00 - info and set that equal to network
15:02 - manager dot match info and then here we
15:05 - can say match info network ID match info
15:10 - dot node ID and then finally a callback
15:14 - method or zero and then a callback
15:17 - method and they've gone ahead and
15:19 - created one of these a default one in
15:23 - five point four so what we'll say is
15:25 - network manager dot on draw
15:30 - connection there we go and unity will
15:34 - take care of the rest and then all we
15:37 - want to do is simply on the network
15:39 - manager called stop we'll stop host and
15:44 - even though we are the client it works
15:47 - fine to just call the stop host method
15:49 - you cannot get away with just calling
15:52 - the stop client it will not clean up the
15:54 - scene properly so just call the stop
15:56 - host and of course we are going to have
15:59 - to change this if we want to do the host
16:01 - migration at a later point but fine now
16:04 - this is going to work so that if you are
16:06 - joining a room hosted by another player
16:09 - and quitting that you can rejoin if
16:12 - you're quitting as a host everyone will
16:15 - get thrown out of the room and it will
16:17 - get cleaned up so if we say that and hit
16:22 - back into unity make sure we are arrow
16:25 - three error free we should be able to
16:29 - actually see this working however one
16:32 - thing that we do need to do is go under
16:35 - prefabs find our player UI drag it in
16:38 - here and make sure that our live roof
16:41 - room button has an on click event that
16:45 - references our past menu and that calls
16:48 - the leave room method and now just hit
16:51 - apply on that and we can delete it again
16:54 - from the scene and it should be working
16:57 - so let's try and build this client into
17:00 - a separate one so we can see it working
17:02 - with another player and this should open
17:06 - up and you can see the new mate with
17:07 - unity intro screen here and I'm going to
17:10 - hit play on this one I'm going to make a
17:14 - test room hit create room you can see it
17:18 - joins on this client then I'm going to
17:21 - go in here and hit refresh and you can
17:24 - see it says my test room is right here
17:26 - so I'm going to click test room it's
17:28 - going to say joining and it's going to
17:31 - join right in in a second there we go so
17:34 - we've now joined the room and
17:36 - established the connection between these
17:37 - two players and we could do this even
17:39 - though they were on two separate
17:41 - computers on two differ
17:43 - in connect internet connections and even
17:45 - cross country and all that it works and
17:48 - you don't have to setup any firewall you
17:50 - don't have to do any of all that stuff
17:52 - cool and what we want to do now is of
17:55 - course drop this connection once again
17:57 - I'm going to escape leave room and you
18:01 - can see it disappears from over here and
18:03 - we've dropped the connection over here
18:05 - and you can see again it is completely
18:07 - gone then we can go back in here hit
18:10 - refresh you can see the room is still
18:12 - there and we can now click it and rejoin
18:15 - and this was the thing that I was having
18:17 - problems with when testing it out before
18:20 - five point four and a lot of other
18:22 - people we're having the same issue but
18:25 - now you can see we can easily rejoin and
18:27 - I'm just going to show you now what
18:29 - happens if I escape or if I leave the
18:32 - room over here on the host I'm going to
18:35 - say leave room and you can see we get
18:37 - kicked out here and we get kicked out
18:39 - here as well and you can still see the
18:42 - test room in here but that's because
18:43 - unity takes about 30 seconds for the
18:47 - room to destroy itself where it keeps
18:51 - checking if there's any players in there
18:53 - and if there isn't at the end of those
18:55 - 30 seconds it's going to destroy the
18:57 - room from the queue and it's not
18:59 - happened yet but it will happen in a
19:01 - moment the problem with this is with
19:04 - retry and reconnect to the room before
19:08 - it's been destroyed while there is no
19:10 - host then it's just going to connect
19:13 - infinitely or you're going to get an
19:15 - error and that's super annoying and
19:17 - there are really great ways to get
19:20 - around this there are ways to get around
19:22 - this I think we're not going to mess
19:24 - with that yet because it's kind of it's
19:28 - not really a net case but it's not
19:30 - something that is really important for
19:31 - functionality and if unity is going to
19:33 - fix this soon anyways that's not much of
19:36 - a reason for us to write all kinds of
19:38 - code you can see it's it's gone now so
19:40 - that's where I'm going to leave you
19:42 - today I hope you found this kind of
19:45 - interesting I hope that we can soon
19:47 - continue to more advanced networking
19:49 - concepts and yeah thanks for watching
19:51 - this video and I'll see you in the next
19:53 - one thank you so much to all of the
19:55 - awesome patrons
19:56 - Porter's who donated in July and a
19:58 - special thanks to vixen famous own
20:00 - Andrew K and Lux game TV these videos
20:03 - wouldn't be possible without you

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to this video in creating a multiplayer FPS in unity today we are going to be creating a pause menu that will allow us to leave the room we're currently in so we will disconnect from the server also we'll be upgrading the entire project 25.4 fixing a bunch of issues that we were having before that you might not have noticed but that I ran into when trying to prepare for this video so I tried to make some functionality for disconnecting from a room and unity gave me a bunch of errors even for the simplest of stuff stuff like disconnecting from some kind of server and then connecting back in if you weren't the host in the first place and it would just throw an error it simply wouldn't work and I went on to the forums and people were getting mad and it was all kind of crazy and then I updated and everything is solved thank you so that will be working something that more advanced like whose migration is not something we'll be looking at today because it's actually not supported yet using the Unity matchmaker but when it is we will definitely have a look at it so without further ado let's dive right into today's video so you can see that I'm here in a unity 5.4 and right off the bat you will get some errors that's because unity has made some API changes so let's just go ahead and double click on the first error here and it will take us here and what I have used here to figure out kind of what how to write things is a very useful little guide unity has made in that documentation so you can search for that or input the URL here I will try and remember and put it in the description and I'm simply under working in unity upgrade guides and then upgrading to unity 5.4 under the API changes and it basically states how things were on before 5.4 and how they are now so it allows you to very quickly just add some things to a code you can see here that before we use the network ID and then we input it an empty string and then a callback method now we just need to do a bunch more into strings and to see ropes so if we go in here on the matchmaker dot this is list matches I wanted to find the joint match down here so we put in the network ID we put in an empty string there another empty string another interesting 0 and then 0 and you can of course read what these variables are doing here so that should work now also match description and it also states this in the guide is now called match info snapshot don't ask me why they would change it to such a name but they have so just change that all over mmm cool then we don't use then we find the match maker list matches and this has changed as well so let's go in here and search for list matches and we can see that this now takes in a trooper a MIDI parameter and a 0 and then 0 so we'll just do comma true comma zero comma zero and again you can read what that does right here and then the callback method has changed we don't use the lit list match response anymore instead instead we use a pool whether or not it was a success we use a string with the extended info so string extended info and finally a list of matching phone app shots so a list of match info snapshots which we are just going to call match list and then of course here we check if match list is equal to null well we also want to check now and you might be able to get away with only doing this but I'm just going to leave both in if it wasn't a success well then we couldn't get the room this time we returned great and down here for each match info snapshot match in match list there we go we don't need that matches and then we set up the match here and that is the match info snapshot and the join room I think that's correct but we need to go in and edit this method here so if we go down here and lower into unity and find the room list item we can go ahead and double click on that and we need to change this to a match info snapshot duplicate that over there and over there and now we should stop getting errors from those two scripts and then we only have to change one thing inside of our host game script so double click on that and that is the actual create match method here and again we'll just reference our manual and if we find the create match there so before it was this short now it is of course longer so two more strings and two more integers so we'll put on string a string and integer an integer and that should indeed be working and I think I think that was it so if we go back into unity here you can see that we are now errorfree whoa we weren't errorfree but I actually got rid of them I think what that was is that I got some weird error messages that simply disappeared when I restarted unity and it looks like this might have been the same so when we are not getting getting any sticky sticky errors it's simply most of the time just an edited thing on that unity just well it's not important to us and they will take care of it so things are working now so that's great and we can go ahead and actually expand upon our game so what I want to do is I want to go into our main level and basically in here when we play what we do is we instantiate a prefab called player UI and this is where I want to add our actual pause menu so if we go and drag our player UI in here so we can edit it and then go on to UI and panel and just reset this and make sure it scales to the entire screen I'm going to remove the background here and I'm going to tin this our black so that it will kind of wash out the background so we can have some we're elements on top of this I'm going to rename this to the pause menu and then let's rightclick on that go on the UI and add a button and this button is of course going to be the leave room button so let's make this very dramatic let's make it very red and let's go under your text here and call this leave room let's bump up the size to something like 20 maybe let's make it white and let's make it bold something like that I mean it's not the prettiest thing in the world but it gets the job done you can try and maybe actually I like it complete the square there or do I know I don't so this is fine and again you should play around more with these UI elements I just don't have time for it here so this is our leave room button and that's perfect so now we can go ahead and add a new component to this and this is going to be the pause game script or it pause pause menu and this will take care of everything related to the pause menu such as the leave room button and I'm just going to double click this to open it up in Visual Studio just so we have it here and you can see all of these warnings are related to the crossplatform input of the standard asset spec they're really non important so we can just go ahead and hit clear and then on side inside of a play UI if we double click that what I want to do here is I want to be able to toggle on and off our pass menu by using the Escape key so undo our update method we will check if input dot get key down and the key that we want to check for is the key code dot escape so if we've pressed the escape key we want to toggle on the pause menu let's now create a function for this so void charcoal pause menu and we need of course the reference to a pause menu so we're going to make this a serialize filled and this is going to be of type game object and we're going to call it pause menu so we can reference this in the inspector and then we say pause menu dot set active and we want it the active state to be the opposite of what it currently is so if it's on we want it off if it's off we want it on and therefore we can simply use pause menu dot active self to get the current active state of the object cool so that will enable and disable it what I also want to do is have some kind of static variable that is easily accessible accessible from within the other scripts that will allow us to easily check if the upgrade or if the pause menu is enabled well then we don't want to be able to shoot we don't want to be able to move or look around stuff like that we can simply use this static variable inside of other scripts so if we go into the pass menu here I'm just going to make a public static bowl code is on and we'll just default that to false and then inside of our player UI we can set pass menu dot is on equal to the new state of our pass menu there we go and we can also make sure that pass menu that is on is set to false in the start method oops so pause menu oops pause menu dot is on equals false when we are starting your game cool so this won't disable anything but it will toggle on and off the pause menu so if we just toggle that off from the beginning and hit up and of course drag it in there hit apply and delete that and then we go into our save that go into our lobby and host a new game and this is just going to be a test hit create room and then hit escape nothing happens and why is this so if we find our player UI here we have the pause menu and for some reason it's not toggling and that's because we want it to be the opposite of its current active self so of course that makes more sense so let's try and hit a play here you can see the room hasn't been cleaned up yet but it will in a moment that's my phone going off so just just a moment whoops sorry about that too many things happening at once so we can go ahead and create a new room here just call it room and now when we hit escape you can see that it pops up and when you hit escape again it disappears cool and so what we want to do now is make sure that we don't move when it pops up and that we don't shoot while it's popped up so to do this we find our player prefab and we find I'll play a shoot script and we go in here under our update method and add a little if statement we simply say if pause menu dot is on well then we can simply return then we don't want to do anything with the shooting mechanics and we can go in and do the same thing with our player controller so if we go into a player controller under the update method right in the beginning if pause menu dot is on then we return and that should actually be all we need to do here so if we hit play again and create a new room here so test room create room and hit escape you can see that we cannot move or shoot and if I toggle it back off we can move and shooting it so that's perfect so the next thing that we want to do is make our a leave room button actually do something and we do this from within the pause menu script so if we double click here we're going to make a new method here a public board called leave room and all this is pretty much going to do is call some functions on the network manager so in order to do that we need to be using unity engine dot networking and it would be a good idea to store a temporary reference to our network manager so let's go up here and make a private network manager and let's just call this well we could just call it network manager let's just do that we could also just call it nm for short let's do the full name here network manager there we go and then inside of our start method is where we will set network manager equal to network manager dot singleton cool and this is just an easier way of writing things out so our code down here won't get very long and then a network manager dot match maker dot drop connection so we want to tell on matchmaker that it should drop the connection to this client and we do that by using network manager dot match info and we want to get multiple things from this match info so that story that so let's make a match or a match info dot let me just see the type of this match info here so this is a match info yon so what we need to do up here is say using unity engine done networking dot match and now we should be able to store a match info here exactly and just call this match info and set that equal to network manager dot match info and then here we can say match info network ID match info dot node ID and then finally a callback method or zero and then a callback method and they've gone ahead and created one of these a default one in five point four so what we'll say is network manager dot on draw connection there we go and unity will take care of the rest and then all we want to do is simply on the network manager called stop we'll stop host and even though we are the client it works fine to just call the stop host method you cannot get away with just calling the stop client it will not clean up the scene properly so just call the stop host and of course we are going to have to change this if we want to do the host migration at a later point but fine now this is going to work so that if you are joining a room hosted by another player and quitting that you can rejoin if you're quitting as a host everyone will get thrown out of the room and it will get cleaned up so if we say that and hit back into unity make sure we are arrow three error free we should be able to actually see this working however one thing that we do need to do is go under prefabs find our player UI drag it in here and make sure that our live roof room button has an on click event that references our past menu and that calls the leave room method and now just hit apply on that and we can delete it again from the scene and it should be working so let's try and build this client into a separate one so we can see it working with another player and this should open up and you can see the new mate with unity intro screen here and I'm going to hit play on this one I'm going to make a test room hit create room you can see it joins on this client then I'm going to go in here and hit refresh and you can see it says my test room is right here so I'm going to click test room it's going to say joining and it's going to join right in in a second there we go so we've now joined the room and established the connection between these two players and we could do this even though they were on two separate computers on two differ in connect internet connections and even cross country and all that it works and you don't have to setup any firewall you don't have to do any of all that stuff cool and what we want to do now is of course drop this connection once again I'm going to escape leave room and you can see it disappears from over here and we've dropped the connection over here and you can see again it is completely gone then we can go back in here hit refresh you can see the room is still there and we can now click it and rejoin and this was the thing that I was having problems with when testing it out before five point four and a lot of other people we're having the same issue but now you can see we can easily rejoin and I'm just going to show you now what happens if I escape or if I leave the room over here on the host I'm going to say leave room and you can see we get kicked out here and we get kicked out here as well and you can still see the test room in here but that's because unity takes about 30 seconds for the room to destroy itself where it keeps checking if there's any players in there and if there isn't at the end of those 30 seconds it's going to destroy the room from the queue and it's not happened yet but it will happen in a moment the problem with this is with retry and reconnect to the room before it's been destroyed while there is no host then it's just going to connect infinitely or you're going to get an error and that's super annoying and there are really great ways to get around this there are ways to get around this I think we're not going to mess with that yet because it's kind of it's not really a net case but it's not something that is really important for functionality and if unity is going to fix this soon anyways that's not much of a reason for us to write all kinds of code you can see it's it's gone now so that's where I'm going to leave you today I hope you found this kind of interesting I hope that we can soon continue to more advanced networking concepts and yeah thanks for watching this video and I'll see you in the next one thank you so much to all of the awesome patrons Porter's who donated in July and a special thanks to vixen famous own Andrew K and Lux game TV these videos wouldn't be possible without you
