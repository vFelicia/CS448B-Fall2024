00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:04 - this video on creating a tower defense
00:06 - game in unity today we are going to be
00:07 - creating a level selector so some kind
00:10 - of menu that will display the amount of
00:12 - levels that we have in our game and then
00:14 - the user can click on them to go to that
00:16 - level we still don't transition between
00:18 - levels so if you complete one level it
00:20 - won't actually take you to the next one
00:22 - that's something we'll add in a future
00:24 - video and also all of these um levels
00:27 - are unlocked immediately we still have
00:29 - to do some way of maybe unlocking levels
00:31 - as we go that could be something really
00:33 - fun to add and of course we also need
00:35 - more levels but I thought we would start
00:37 - with the level selector and then work
00:39 - from there so let's just jump right into
00:41 - unity and what I want to do is just base
00:44 - this off one of the already existing
00:46 - scenes that we have whoops don't want to
00:48 - save this one and I thought we would
00:50 - just work off the main menu because it
00:52 - has this background and that feels nice
00:55 - and also we only have the scene fader
00:57 - and not a lot else in here so let's just
01:00 - duplicate the main menu and let's rename
01:02 - this to level
01:04 - selector and or select or whatever I'm
01:06 - just going to do level select actually
01:09 - and uh let's double click on level
01:11 - select so you can see that's the one
01:12 - that's opened up now and we want to
01:15 - delete pretty much everything in here we
01:16 - want to remove the standard turret we
01:18 - want to uh remove well we can actually
01:21 - keep this background here to use as a
01:24 - background for our UI and then just
01:26 - build our UI on top of that or we could
01:28 - have a flat color that's totally to you
01:30 - I think I'm just going to leave it in
01:31 - here and uh just remove the main menu uh
01:35 - object so that we don't have the
01:36 - functionality for our main menu in our
01:38 - level select uh
01:40 - script cool so now we can just save that
01:42 - and we can go ahead and start building
01:44 - the UI so let's right click create UI
01:47 - canvas and we want to rename this to
01:49 - something like UI Canvas OR overlay
01:52 - canvas something like that I think we
01:54 - want to change the UI scale mode to
01:56 - scale with screen size so that when we
01:58 - scale this up our UI is going to scale
02:00 - with it and um I don't want to
02:03 - necessarily select Pixel Perfect let's
02:06 - just go under the UI canvas in the scene
02:08 - view here focus on it so we can get a
02:10 - good view and make sure you're in 2D
02:11 - mode and let's right click go UI and
02:14 - let's start by maybe creating some kind
02:16 - of text that is going to say select
02:21 - level and uh we want to change this to a
02:24 - robotto maybe even the thin one and we
02:26 - definitely want to scale this up quite a
02:28 - bit I also want to Anchor it to the
02:31 - bottom here so the bottom left and let's
02:35 - bump up the font size here so we can
02:37 - actually see this in the game want to
02:39 - change the color here to White and we
02:41 - can maybe also add a shadow but for now
02:43 - we'll just leave it as is and then we'll
02:45 - see if that's necessary uh later so I
02:48 - think this already looks just fine and
02:50 - uh we can maybe just move this up a tiny
02:52 - bit to make room for our actual UI so
02:55 - this is going to be our title and then
02:57 - we can go here and go UI and then
03:00 - panel and I want to create kind of a a
03:03 - panel uh for all of our level buttons to
03:07 - be in so let's just uh make sure this
03:09 - doesn't stretch with the scene I wanted
03:11 - instead to just be centered or anchored
03:14 - in the middle so just click there no
03:16 - holding down Al or anything and we can
03:18 - simply just scale this whole thing down
03:20 - so I wanted to scale down on the Y here
03:24 - want it to go kind of far down something
03:26 - like that and I want it to be about the
03:28 - same size or have the same starting
03:31 - point as our text so something like that
03:34 - looks fine for now and remember we can
03:36 - always tweak this later what I also want
03:39 - to do is definitely change the color to
03:41 - a black color and we can see what that
03:43 - looks like in the game and I actually
03:45 - want to bump down the alpha even more so
03:47 - something like that I think that looks
03:49 - quite decent and uh it's definitely um
03:53 - usable so this here is going to be our
03:57 - levels and uh this is the actual
04:00 - background for our levels I also want to
04:03 - have an object that is responsible for
04:05 - laying out all of our level buttons so
04:07 - some kind of grid I also want to have
04:10 - another object that's responsible for
04:12 - allowing us to scroll through levels so
04:14 - let's say we have more levels that we
04:16 - can show on the screen I want to use a
04:18 - scroll Rec so that we can um actually
04:20 - scroll through and we'll also add a
04:22 - scroll bar over here for displaying the
04:24 - rest of them so um this is our
04:27 - background so now we can go ahead and
04:28 - create a new um empty object under that
04:32 - background and we can just reset that
04:34 - and we also want this to we actually we
04:37 - want this to scale with our parent
04:40 - object so we'll just um you know hold
04:42 - down alt here and click in the bottom
04:45 - right and this here is going to be kind
04:48 - of our
04:50 - scroll uh our scroll rect and uh we can
04:54 - Jo maybe just give it a tiny bit on the
04:58 - left here so like 20
05:00 - on the left top right and bottom just so
05:03 - we kind of separate it out from our
05:05 - background I think that's going to look
05:06 - pretty nice and um then we can go ahead
05:09 - and create a new empty object under that
05:12 - as well and this here is going to be our
05:15 - actual Grid or we could also just call
05:17 - it the content so um we'll have to link
05:21 - all of these up in a moment and it's
05:22 - kind of confusing that you have to
05:23 - create the hierarchy in this way but
05:25 - after having done it a few times you're
05:27 - going to get used to it and yeah it's
05:29 - with every as with everything else in
05:31 - unity they have their standards of doing
05:33 - things and on you once you get used to
05:35 - them uh it shouldn't really be an issue
05:38 - so what we can do now is maybe um create
05:41 - a bottom uh button for our content so
05:44 - let's just size it up here and this is
05:46 - going to be automatically sizing to fit
05:48 - our content so that's why I don't really
05:50 - care about the size here I just wanted
05:52 - to make it a bit larger so that we can
05:54 - see our button that we now are going to
05:57 - create and uh let's just just make this
06:00 - say 100 by a 100 and uh actually that
06:04 - doesn't matter because what we'll go
06:06 - ahead and do right away is add a grid
06:08 - layout to this content so we'll go in
06:11 - here and we'll say we want a grid layout
06:13 - group and that now allows us if we
06:16 - duplicate this spot in here I'm just
06:18 - going to make a bunch of them you can
06:20 - see that it automatically lays them out
06:23 - so that's a really really handy feature
06:25 - in un and what we'll do is we'll um just
06:29 - again and anchor this to scale with our
06:31 - scroll W just to see how that looks and
06:34 - you can see that already looks pretty
06:36 - nice and what we can do is maybe keep
06:38 - the cell size at 100 but definitely add
06:41 - some spacing so I want something like
06:43 - maybe 13 on the X maybe a bit less I do
06:47 - want there to be another row so maybe 11
06:51 - on the X there and let's do the same
06:53 - thing on the Y so that already looks
06:57 - quite decent and what we can then do to
06:59 - our content here is we can add a um
07:02 - content size fitter and what this will
07:06 - do and it will only do it in just a
07:07 - second is it will automatically resize
07:10 - this object to fit of the button so in
07:13 - our case it would resize to fit like
07:16 - this and then if we uh remove the buttom
07:19 - button here uh it would automatically
07:22 - just bump up here so that's really
07:24 - really handy because our scroll R will
07:28 - um Orient this content here um and uh
07:32 - depending on the size of the content so
07:34 - if the content is larger than the size
07:36 - of our scroll R it's going to uh of
07:38 - course allow us to scroll through that
07:41 - so it's really really neat that we can
07:42 - get our content to resize to uh fit the
07:45 - actual size of all of the buttons
07:47 - together so in order to make it do this
07:50 - first off I want to take the Anchor
07:52 - Point here and bump it up to one on the
07:54 - Y just to make sure that it will Orient
07:57 - itself from the bottom um
07:59 - um Cent or from the upper Center so that
08:02 - it will scale in this way and not scale
08:05 - and both down and up at the same time oh
08:09 - and unity is messing around here I think
08:11 - uh the unity UI system is really really
08:15 - awesome but sometimes you just get weird
08:17 - Behavior Like These Warnings here and
08:19 - they're not actually dangerous because
08:21 - they won't actually do anything inside
08:24 - of the game but you can see just how
08:26 - much they're messing everything up right
08:28 - now so let's just disable our content
08:29 - size fitter Let's uh try and scale this
08:32 - up and you can see Unity is just going
08:34 - completely crazy here so I might have to
08:37 - restart and it's a really really
08:39 - annoying thing that this is happening I
08:41 - I really hope they're working on it it
08:43 - looks like it kind of stopped Ming up
08:45 - there cool so yeah it's just unity's UI
08:49 - system what are you going to do so what
08:51 - we can do now that we've anchored it up
08:53 - here is reenable the content size fitter
08:56 - and on the vertical fit we now want to
08:59 - put preferred size and you can see now
09:02 - that it automatically rescales so if we
09:04 - delete this one it's going to snap up
09:06 - there indeed it does cool so that's
09:09 - already working so what we want to do
09:11 - now is of course go in and make these
09:13 - buttons a bit more interesting and to do
09:16 - that um let's just remove all of them
09:18 - except for one and let's rename this to
09:21 - something like level button and um we
09:25 - can definitely mess around with some of
09:27 - these settings um the first thing that I
09:28 - want do is change the text object here
09:32 - to not say button I wanted to say the
09:34 - number of our level so this is going to
09:36 - be our first level and we can go in here
09:38 - and bump up the font size quite a bit
09:41 - and also want to change that to robotto
09:43 - thin I like that look something like
09:46 - that looks pretty good already actually
09:48 - and you can definitely just use white
09:50 - and black in here but I also thought it
09:52 - could be fun if we maybe uh tinted this
09:54 - uh button here in uh in some kind of
09:57 - color but it might just be
10:00 - yeah it it doesn't look better I think
10:02 - we should just stick to the very
10:03 - minimalist theme but as always I really
10:06 - recommend that you spend some time on it
10:08 - play around with it get it to look
10:10 - exactly the way that you want it to so
10:13 - I'm also going to go into our level
10:14 - button here and add a
10:17 - shadow and just to give it a tiny bit of
10:22 - a 3D feel here to make it stand out and
10:25 - I'm definitely going to decrease the
10:27 - alpha on that that channel so you can
10:29 - see that looks uh a little better it
10:32 - just gives a tiny more detail so it
10:34 - doesn't look too simple and dumb so yeah
10:38 - I I really like that and one thing we
10:40 - can also do uh is maybe change the hover
10:43 - animation and click but we can do that
10:45 - in a second so now let's turn turn this
10:48 - button here into a prefab by going under
10:50 - the prefabs folder and dragging it in
10:53 - there and now we can just freely
10:55 - duplicate it as many times as we want
10:58 - because now when we change of course our
11:00 - level button down here uh they are all
11:02 - going to update so that's really handy
11:05 - and I thought we could um maybe just see
11:09 - how this looks when we hit play at
11:10 - moment so um you can see that they are
11:12 - currently extending Beyond uh the um
11:16 - confines of our scroll wct and we aren't
11:18 - actually able to drag them anywhere we
11:20 - can click on them but nothing will
11:21 - happen and also um you can see that it
11:25 - doesn't cut off here we want some kind
11:27 - of masking to happen so that they won't
11:30 - just well uh be shown in places that
11:33 - they shouldn't be shown so that's maybe
11:36 - the first thing that we should add is go
11:38 - to a scroll right here and add a Syle
11:41 - mask and we can make this a wrecked um
11:44 - mask 2D just to make it simply Square um
11:48 - and you can see that just cuts
11:49 - everything off that is without the
11:51 - confines of the scroll re scroll wck so
11:55 - you can see there it cuts everything off
11:56 - here it's just a very very simple effect
11:59 - but it looks quite cool and then what we
12:01 - can do is add some actual scrolling so
12:04 - if we go to a scroll R and add a well
12:07 - you guessed it a scroll wck uh we should
12:10 - be able to now drag in our content and
12:14 - uh for the viewport that's going to be
12:16 - the same as the scroll Rec component so
12:18 - we'll just drag in our scroll re here
12:21 - and everything else we should be able to
12:22 - leave as is we might want to disable
12:25 - horizontal scrolling because we only
12:27 - want to do that on the vertical so now
12:29 - you should see that when we go in here
12:31 - we should be able to click and drag on
12:34 - these buttons and you can even see how
12:35 - smooth that feels so a really really
12:38 - simple uh and easy to make effect and we
12:41 - can still click on all the buttons to
12:43 - activate them so that's really cool and
12:46 - you can even see a bit of hover
12:47 - animation in there so the next thing
12:50 - that I wanted to do was maybe spice off
12:52 - our spice up our hover animation a tiny
12:55 - bit because I think the ending looks a
12:57 - bit boring so luckily in some of the
13:00 - earlier videos we created this cool
13:02 - hover animation for our buttons and we
13:04 - can just go ahead and reuse that so all
13:06 - we need to do is go to transition and of
13:08 - course I've selected our prefab to
13:10 - change all of them at the same time so
13:12 - go to transition and select animation
13:15 - and we want to turn off navigation and
13:18 - under um and we want to go down and hit
13:21 - add component and add in an animator and
13:24 - this is where we created the controller
13:26 - from earlier called button
13:29 - and this is basically a very very simple
13:32 - uh controller all it does is it has a
13:35 - normal um animation with a scale of 111
13:40 - then it has a highlighted animation U
13:42 - with a scale of 1.05 and we also have a
13:46 - tiny bit of hover animation in there so
13:48 - you can see that it actually does a bit
13:50 - of pulsating but you can just put a
13:52 - single key frame here for the uh
13:55 - 1.05 and we do the same thing when we
13:58 - press it so we wanted to go back to
14:01 - 111 cool so yeah that's pretty much all
14:04 - that is so you can quickly recreate that
14:06 - or go back and watch the earlier videos
14:08 - if you want to see how we did that so
14:09 - you can see already that that looks just
14:12 - much much better and feels much smoother
14:15 - much smoother
14:16 - cool so um next up what we can do is uh
14:21 - link these buttons so that they will
14:24 - actually transition to a new level
14:26 - because currently nothing happens when
14:28 - we click condom and in order to do that
14:31 - let's go ahead and create a script that
14:33 - we want to act as the central place for
14:36 - doing logic when it comes to selecting
14:38 - different levels in the beginning it's
14:40 - just going to have a very simple public
14:42 - method called something like uh select
14:44 - or load that takes in the name of the
14:46 - level that we want to load and then we
14:48 - tell the scene fader to fade into that
14:51 - level um but in the future it can handle
14:54 - stuff like looking at what levels are
14:57 - locked and showing a locked graphic
14:59 - checking if you can actually play that
15:01 - level it could also dynamically load all
15:04 - of the levels that you have available
15:06 - from an array or something and put them
15:08 - in here so you don't have to add a new
15:10 - button every time you make a new level
15:12 - it can do a lot of stuff but for now
15:14 - we'll just have it be really really
15:15 - simple so let's create an empty object
15:18 - let's reset the transform and let's call
15:20 - it a level
15:22 - selector and we can go in here and add
15:24 - component level
15:27 - selector and we can double click on that
15:30 - to open it up in visual studio and
15:33 - that's actually the first scripting
15:34 - we're going to do for this video so I'm
15:37 - excited I'm just going to have a sip of
15:39 - water there awesome so what we can do in
15:41 - here is just remove system do
15:43 - Collections and system. collections.
15:45 - generic we're not going to be using
15:47 - those and we'll go in here and create a
15:49 - public
15:51 - void called let's just call it select
15:54 - actually and the function is going to
15:57 - take in a string with the level name
16:00 - that we want to select or the name of
16:02 - the level that we want to select and um
16:05 - we could just go in here and use uh
16:07 - Unity engine. scen manager do um load
16:11 - level and then uh load the level
16:14 - directly but let's just utilize the fact
16:17 - that we do have some functionality for
16:19 - fading between scenes so in our case we
16:22 - want to get a reference to our scene
16:24 - fader and we can just call this fader
16:27 - and then we can use fader do Fade 2 and
16:31 - then put in the level name here so
16:34 - that's just going to look a bit nicer
16:36 - and now all we need to do is find our
16:38 - level selector and drag in our scene
16:41 - fader into the fader um field there and
16:44 - we can maybe just drag up our level
16:46 - selector to organize that at the top so
16:49 - now we can go into our different buttons
16:52 - and believe it or not that was all the
16:53 - scripting that we needed to do for this
16:55 - video so we can go into our first button
16:57 - for example we can can go down here and
16:59 - add an on click event and all we need to
17:02 - do is drag in the level selector go on
17:05 - uh the level selector script and select
17:08 - choose select and the uh and we get a
17:12 - string here that we can input and the
17:14 - level that we want to load is something
17:15 - like level one and we can do the same
17:18 - one for the second one except for this
17:20 - one we want to change the text to two
17:23 - and we want to go in and add an on click
17:25 - event drag in our level selector go on
17:28 - the level selector script and choose
17:31 - select and let's input now level two so
17:35 - it's really really really simple and we
17:37 - can maybe just delete all of the
17:39 - remaining levels so that we don't have
17:41 - some that will not work uh they were
17:43 - just for testing and uh what we can do
17:47 - now is create these levels so we
17:49 - currently have our main level let's
17:51 - rename this one to level one and uh if
17:55 - we duplicate this level it will aut
17:57 - automatically Ally name it level two and
18:00 - if we now just jump into level two I
18:02 - thought we would just quickly change
18:04 - something about this level so that we
18:06 - can easily see that um it's different so
18:10 - for this level let's just go in and
18:12 - change our start lives from one to 10 so
18:16 - on level one our start lives are going
18:18 - to be one and on level two our start
18:21 - lives is going to be 10 so uh that
18:25 - should just give us a clear idea of what
18:27 - level we're currently on so now if we go
18:29 - back into our select level hit play we
18:33 - should be able to go to level
18:35 - one and indeed it says one lives here
18:39 - and if we then restart here and select
18:42 - level two it's going to go to level two
18:46 - no and here we get an error and that's
18:48 - because we haven't added level two to
18:50 - the build settings and this is something
18:52 - you need to do for all scenes just you
18:54 - need to drag them under the build
18:56 - settings so let's go to build settings
18:58 - and let's drag in level two let's also
19:01 - drag in level select because we're going
19:03 - to be transitioning to that in just a
19:05 - moment so I'm just going to drag it up
19:07 - here but the order really doesn't matter
19:09 - for us so we can hit save again hit play
19:12 - and transy select level two now and it's
19:15 - going to transition and it's going to
19:16 - say 10 lives so now we you can just go
19:19 - completely nuts create as many levels as
19:22 - you want to and add them in here and uh
19:25 - yeah you're going to have a lot of
19:26 - replay value so that's awesome
19:29 - of course we also want to have a way of
19:31 - going to or transitioning to this level
19:33 - select level scene um and we want to do
19:37 - that from our main menu so I thought
19:38 - when we hit play here instead of just
19:40 - playing from level one let's just load
19:43 - up the level select and then the user
19:45 - can choose for himself what he wants to
19:46 - play so let's under our main menu
19:48 - instead of uh having our main level as
19:51 - the level to load let's go in here and
19:54 - have level select so now when you go and
19:57 - hit play you start start at the main
19:58 - menu you hit play it transitions to our
20:02 - level select and then you can uh choose
20:05 - either one or two I'm going to select
20:07 - two and it transitions uh further and
20:09 - you can even go back here if you're at
20:11 - Escape go to the menu hit play again we
20:15 - can select maybe level one this time and
20:17 - it's going to go in there instead so you
20:19 - can see how nicely these scenes are tied
20:22 - together the last thing that I wanted to
20:25 - show you is under our level select and
20:28 - what I wanted to do was just add a very
20:30 - simple scroll bar in case you don't like
20:33 - this uh dragging around of the objects I
20:37 - kind of like it but maybe it's not too
20:39 - intuitive if people have never really
20:40 - seen it before I mean on phones it's
20:43 - it's really common but doing it with a
20:45 - mouse is not really standard so what
20:48 - we'll do instead is go in and uh let's
20:50 - just create a bunch of test buttons here
20:53 - so let's just duplicate this one a bunch
20:55 - of
20:55 - times and let's also go under our
20:59 - levels this main object which has our
21:02 - background let's go UI and then create a
21:05 - scroll
21:07 - bar and of course this is currently
21:09 - centered to the horizontal a axis so
21:12 - let's go down here and change from uh
21:15 - the direction from left to right and
21:17 - then instead have it be bottom to top
21:20 - and it's going to automatically rescale
21:22 - it here and then what we can do is maybe
21:25 - move it over here somewhere there looks
21:28 - just fine we can also scale it up like
21:32 - that I think that looks a lot better and
21:34 - of course we need to reference this so
21:36 - we need to go into our scroll rect and
21:38 - drag our scroll bar into the vertical
21:41 - scroll bar field and now you can see it
21:43 - repositions itself and resizes itself in
21:47 - such a way that it will fit on our
21:51 - content and when we then scroll to the
21:52 - bottom here you can see our content
21:54 - Scrolls up and even we can still drag
21:57 - like this
21:58 - and it's just going to uh move the
22:01 - scroll bar so they are both interl and
22:04 - will uh interact with each other so
22:06 - that's awesome and we can even make our
22:08 - scroll bar a bit prettier because I yeah
22:12 - this is not too good and we can maybe
22:14 - take our this is our background so we
22:17 - can take that and make it kind of black
22:19 - and very very
22:21 - transparent something like that just
22:23 - very seethrough and then we can find our
22:27 - sliding area and then the handle and we
22:29 - can change the color on this also to be
22:32 - black but um add a bit more of opacity
22:36 - to that one so now we should be able to
22:39 - hit play and you can see that looks just
22:42 - a little bit better I think and we can
22:43 - also even use our scroll wheel uh to U
22:46 - change it so that's awesome and
22:48 - everything is working we can go ahead
22:50 - and delete all of our buttons here and
22:53 - you can see that when it's not needed
22:54 - it's just going to be this um uh this um
23:00 - what should we call it uniformly colored
23:02 - bar that you can really interact with
23:04 - you can of course add a script if you
23:06 - want it to fade out when it's not needed
23:08 - but I like it being there like this so
23:11 - that was pretty much all I wanted to
23:14 - show you in this video I hope you
23:16 - enjoyed it let me know what you want to
23:17 - see next I want to do more with levels
23:20 - definitely have some kind of way of
23:22 - transitioning to a new level once you've
23:24 - U mastered the uh the previous one and
23:27 - also Al some way of unlocking levels
23:30 - which will give us a handy way of
23:31 - talking about uh saving data inside of
23:34 - unity so I thought that's pretty
23:36 - exciting but of course let me know if
23:38 - I'm going off on a tangent and no no one
23:41 - really wants to see this so yeah thanks
23:43 - for watching and I will see you in the
23:45 - next video thanks to all the awesome
23:47 - patreon supporters who donated in

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to this video on creating a tower defense game in unity today we are going to be creating a level selector so some kind of menu that will display the amount of levels that we have in our game and then the user can click on them to go to that level we still don't transition between levels so if you complete one level it won't actually take you to the next one that's something we'll add in a future video and also all of these um levels are unlocked immediately we still have to do some way of maybe unlocking levels as we go that could be something really fun to add and of course we also need more levels but I thought we would start with the level selector and then work from there so let's just jump right into unity and what I want to do is just base this off one of the already existing scenes that we have whoops don't want to save this one and I thought we would just work off the main menu because it has this background and that feels nice and also we only have the scene fader and not a lot else in here so let's just duplicate the main menu and let's rename this to level selector and or select or whatever I'm just going to do level select actually and uh let's double click on level select so you can see that's the one that's opened up now and we want to delete pretty much everything in here we want to remove the standard turret we want to uh remove well we can actually keep this background here to use as a background for our UI and then just build our UI on top of that or we could have a flat color that's totally to you I think I'm just going to leave it in here and uh just remove the main menu uh object so that we don't have the functionality for our main menu in our level select uh script cool so now we can just save that and we can go ahead and start building the UI so let's right click create UI canvas and we want to rename this to something like UI Canvas OR overlay canvas something like that I think we want to change the UI scale mode to scale with screen size so that when we scale this up our UI is going to scale with it and um I don't want to necessarily select Pixel Perfect let's just go under the UI canvas in the scene view here focus on it so we can get a good view and make sure you're in 2D mode and let's right click go UI and let's start by maybe creating some kind of text that is going to say select level and uh we want to change this to a robotto maybe even the thin one and we definitely want to scale this up quite a bit I also want to Anchor it to the bottom here so the bottom left and let's bump up the font size here so we can actually see this in the game want to change the color here to White and we can maybe also add a shadow but for now we'll just leave it as is and then we'll see if that's necessary uh later so I think this already looks just fine and uh we can maybe just move this up a tiny bit to make room for our actual UI so this is going to be our title and then we can go here and go UI and then panel and I want to create kind of a a panel uh for all of our level buttons to be in so let's just uh make sure this doesn't stretch with the scene I wanted instead to just be centered or anchored in the middle so just click there no holding down Al or anything and we can simply just scale this whole thing down so I wanted to scale down on the Y here want it to go kind of far down something like that and I want it to be about the same size or have the same starting point as our text so something like that looks fine for now and remember we can always tweak this later what I also want to do is definitely change the color to a black color and we can see what that looks like in the game and I actually want to bump down the alpha even more so something like that I think that looks quite decent and uh it's definitely um usable so this here is going to be our levels and uh this is the actual background for our levels I also want to have an object that is responsible for laying out all of our level buttons so some kind of grid I also want to have another object that's responsible for allowing us to scroll through levels so let's say we have more levels that we can show on the screen I want to use a scroll Rec so that we can um actually scroll through and we'll also add a scroll bar over here for displaying the rest of them so um this is our background so now we can go ahead and create a new um empty object under that background and we can just reset that and we also want this to we actually we want this to scale with our parent object so we'll just um you know hold down alt here and click in the bottom right and this here is going to be kind of our scroll uh our scroll rect and uh we can Jo maybe just give it a tiny bit on the left here so like 20 on the left top right and bottom just so we kind of separate it out from our background I think that's going to look pretty nice and um then we can go ahead and create a new empty object under that as well and this here is going to be our actual Grid or we could also just call it the content so um we'll have to link all of these up in a moment and it's kind of confusing that you have to create the hierarchy in this way but after having done it a few times you're going to get used to it and yeah it's with every as with everything else in unity they have their standards of doing things and on you once you get used to them uh it shouldn't really be an issue so what we can do now is maybe um create a bottom uh button for our content so let's just size it up here and this is going to be automatically sizing to fit our content so that's why I don't really care about the size here I just wanted to make it a bit larger so that we can see our button that we now are going to create and uh let's just just make this say 100 by a 100 and uh actually that doesn't matter because what we'll go ahead and do right away is add a grid layout to this content so we'll go in here and we'll say we want a grid layout group and that now allows us if we duplicate this spot in here I'm just going to make a bunch of them you can see that it automatically lays them out so that's a really really handy feature in un and what we'll do is we'll um just again and anchor this to scale with our scroll W just to see how that looks and you can see that already looks pretty nice and what we can do is maybe keep the cell size at 100 but definitely add some spacing so I want something like maybe 13 on the X maybe a bit less I do want there to be another row so maybe 11 on the X there and let's do the same thing on the Y so that already looks quite decent and what we can then do to our content here is we can add a um content size fitter and what this will do and it will only do it in just a second is it will automatically resize this object to fit of the button so in our case it would resize to fit like this and then if we uh remove the buttom button here uh it would automatically just bump up here so that's really really handy because our scroll R will um Orient this content here um and uh depending on the size of the content so if the content is larger than the size of our scroll R it's going to uh of course allow us to scroll through that so it's really really neat that we can get our content to resize to uh fit the actual size of all of the buttons together so in order to make it do this first off I want to take the Anchor Point here and bump it up to one on the Y just to make sure that it will Orient itself from the bottom um um Cent or from the upper Center so that it will scale in this way and not scale and both down and up at the same time oh and unity is messing around here I think uh the unity UI system is really really awesome but sometimes you just get weird Behavior Like These Warnings here and they're not actually dangerous because they won't actually do anything inside of the game but you can see just how much they're messing everything up right now so let's just disable our content size fitter Let's uh try and scale this up and you can see Unity is just going completely crazy here so I might have to restart and it's a really really annoying thing that this is happening I I really hope they're working on it it looks like it kind of stopped Ming up there cool so yeah it's just unity's UI system what are you going to do so what we can do now that we've anchored it up here is reenable the content size fitter and on the vertical fit we now want to put preferred size and you can see now that it automatically rescales so if we delete this one it's going to snap up there indeed it does cool so that's already working so what we want to do now is of course go in and make these buttons a bit more interesting and to do that um let's just remove all of them except for one and let's rename this to something like level button and um we can definitely mess around with some of these settings um the first thing that I want do is change the text object here to not say button I wanted to say the number of our level so this is going to be our first level and we can go in here and bump up the font size quite a bit and also want to change that to robotto thin I like that look something like that looks pretty good already actually and you can definitely just use white and black in here but I also thought it could be fun if we maybe uh tinted this uh button here in uh in some kind of color but it might just be yeah it it doesn't look better I think we should just stick to the very minimalist theme but as always I really recommend that you spend some time on it play around with it get it to look exactly the way that you want it to so I'm also going to go into our level button here and add a shadow and just to give it a tiny bit of a 3D feel here to make it stand out and I'm definitely going to decrease the alpha on that that channel so you can see that looks uh a little better it just gives a tiny more detail so it doesn't look too simple and dumb so yeah I I really like that and one thing we can also do uh is maybe change the hover animation and click but we can do that in a second so now let's turn turn this button here into a prefab by going under the prefabs folder and dragging it in there and now we can just freely duplicate it as many times as we want because now when we change of course our level button down here uh they are all going to update so that's really handy and I thought we could um maybe just see how this looks when we hit play at moment so um you can see that they are currently extending Beyond uh the um confines of our scroll wct and we aren't actually able to drag them anywhere we can click on them but nothing will happen and also um you can see that it doesn't cut off here we want some kind of masking to happen so that they won't just well uh be shown in places that they shouldn't be shown so that's maybe the first thing that we should add is go to a scroll right here and add a Syle mask and we can make this a wrecked um mask 2D just to make it simply Square um and you can see that just cuts everything off that is without the confines of the scroll re scroll wck so you can see there it cuts everything off here it's just a very very simple effect but it looks quite cool and then what we can do is add some actual scrolling so if we go to a scroll R and add a well you guessed it a scroll wck uh we should be able to now drag in our content and uh for the viewport that's going to be the same as the scroll Rec component so we'll just drag in our scroll re here and everything else we should be able to leave as is we might want to disable horizontal scrolling because we only want to do that on the vertical so now you should see that when we go in here we should be able to click and drag on these buttons and you can even see how smooth that feels so a really really simple uh and easy to make effect and we can still click on all the buttons to activate them so that's really cool and you can even see a bit of hover animation in there so the next thing that I wanted to do was maybe spice off our spice up our hover animation a tiny bit because I think the ending looks a bit boring so luckily in some of the earlier videos we created this cool hover animation for our buttons and we can just go ahead and reuse that so all we need to do is go to transition and of course I've selected our prefab to change all of them at the same time so go to transition and select animation and we want to turn off navigation and under um and we want to go down and hit add component and add in an animator and this is where we created the controller from earlier called button and this is basically a very very simple uh controller all it does is it has a normal um animation with a scale of 111 then it has a highlighted animation U with a scale of 1.05 and we also have a tiny bit of hover animation in there so you can see that it actually does a bit of pulsating but you can just put a single key frame here for the uh 1.05 and we do the same thing when we press it so we wanted to go back to 111 cool so yeah that's pretty much all that is so you can quickly recreate that or go back and watch the earlier videos if you want to see how we did that so you can see already that that looks just much much better and feels much smoother much smoother cool so um next up what we can do is uh link these buttons so that they will actually transition to a new level because currently nothing happens when we click condom and in order to do that let's go ahead and create a script that we want to act as the central place for doing logic when it comes to selecting different levels in the beginning it's just going to have a very simple public method called something like uh select or load that takes in the name of the level that we want to load and then we tell the scene fader to fade into that level um but in the future it can handle stuff like looking at what levels are locked and showing a locked graphic checking if you can actually play that level it could also dynamically load all of the levels that you have available from an array or something and put them in here so you don't have to add a new button every time you make a new level it can do a lot of stuff but for now we'll just have it be really really simple so let's create an empty object let's reset the transform and let's call it a level selector and we can go in here and add component level selector and we can double click on that to open it up in visual studio and that's actually the first scripting we're going to do for this video so I'm excited I'm just going to have a sip of water there awesome so what we can do in here is just remove system do Collections and system. collections. generic we're not going to be using those and we'll go in here and create a public void called let's just call it select actually and the function is going to take in a string with the level name that we want to select or the name of the level that we want to select and um we could just go in here and use uh Unity engine. scen manager do um load level and then uh load the level directly but let's just utilize the fact that we do have some functionality for fading between scenes so in our case we want to get a reference to our scene fader and we can just call this fader and then we can use fader do Fade 2 and then put in the level name here so that's just going to look a bit nicer and now all we need to do is find our level selector and drag in our scene fader into the fader um field there and we can maybe just drag up our level selector to organize that at the top so now we can go into our different buttons and believe it or not that was all the scripting that we needed to do for this video so we can go into our first button for example we can can go down here and add an on click event and all we need to do is drag in the level selector go on uh the level selector script and select choose select and the uh and we get a string here that we can input and the level that we want to load is something like level one and we can do the same one for the second one except for this one we want to change the text to two and we want to go in and add an on click event drag in our level selector go on the level selector script and choose select and let's input now level two so it's really really really simple and we can maybe just delete all of the remaining levels so that we don't have some that will not work uh they were just for testing and uh what we can do now is create these levels so we currently have our main level let's rename this one to level one and uh if we duplicate this level it will aut automatically Ally name it level two and if we now just jump into level two I thought we would just quickly change something about this level so that we can easily see that um it's different so for this level let's just go in and change our start lives from one to 10 so on level one our start lives are going to be one and on level two our start lives is going to be 10 so uh that should just give us a clear idea of what level we're currently on so now if we go back into our select level hit play we should be able to go to level one and indeed it says one lives here and if we then restart here and select level two it's going to go to level two no and here we get an error and that's because we haven't added level two to the build settings and this is something you need to do for all scenes just you need to drag them under the build settings so let's go to build settings and let's drag in level two let's also drag in level select because we're going to be transitioning to that in just a moment so I'm just going to drag it up here but the order really doesn't matter for us so we can hit save again hit play and transy select level two now and it's going to transition and it's going to say 10 lives so now we you can just go completely nuts create as many levels as you want to and add them in here and uh yeah you're going to have a lot of replay value so that's awesome of course we also want to have a way of going to or transitioning to this level select level scene um and we want to do that from our main menu so I thought when we hit play here instead of just playing from level one let's just load up the level select and then the user can choose for himself what he wants to play so let's under our main menu instead of uh having our main level as the level to load let's go in here and have level select so now when you go and hit play you start start at the main menu you hit play it transitions to our level select and then you can uh choose either one or two I'm going to select two and it transitions uh further and you can even go back here if you're at Escape go to the menu hit play again we can select maybe level one this time and it's going to go in there instead so you can see how nicely these scenes are tied together the last thing that I wanted to show you is under our level select and what I wanted to do was just add a very simple scroll bar in case you don't like this uh dragging around of the objects I kind of like it but maybe it's not too intuitive if people have never really seen it before I mean on phones it's it's really common but doing it with a mouse is not really standard so what we'll do instead is go in and uh let's just create a bunch of test buttons here so let's just duplicate this one a bunch of times and let's also go under our levels this main object which has our background let's go UI and then create a scroll bar and of course this is currently centered to the horizontal a axis so let's go down here and change from uh the direction from left to right and then instead have it be bottom to top and it's going to automatically rescale it here and then what we can do is maybe move it over here somewhere there looks just fine we can also scale it up like that I think that looks a lot better and of course we need to reference this so we need to go into our scroll rect and drag our scroll bar into the vertical scroll bar field and now you can see it repositions itself and resizes itself in such a way that it will fit on our content and when we then scroll to the bottom here you can see our content Scrolls up and even we can still drag like this and it's just going to uh move the scroll bar so they are both interl and will uh interact with each other so that's awesome and we can even make our scroll bar a bit prettier because I yeah this is not too good and we can maybe take our this is our background so we can take that and make it kind of black and very very transparent something like that just very seethrough and then we can find our sliding area and then the handle and we can change the color on this also to be black but um add a bit more of opacity to that one so now we should be able to hit play and you can see that looks just a little bit better I think and we can also even use our scroll wheel uh to U change it so that's awesome and everything is working we can go ahead and delete all of our buttons here and you can see that when it's not needed it's just going to be this um uh this um what should we call it uniformly colored bar that you can really interact with you can of course add a script if you want it to fade out when it's not needed but I like it being there like this so that was pretty much all I wanted to show you in this video I hope you enjoyed it let me know what you want to see next I want to do more with levels definitely have some kind of way of transitioning to a new level once you've U mastered the uh the previous one and also Al some way of unlocking levels which will give us a handy way of talking about uh saving data inside of unity so I thought that's pretty exciting but of course let me know if I'm going off on a tangent and no no one really wants to see this so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to all the awesome patreon supporters who donated in November and a special thanks to Sultan Al Sharif F marifi James Kell hound and Robert bonam
