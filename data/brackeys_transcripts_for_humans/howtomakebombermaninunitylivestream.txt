00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to this live
00:02 - stream tutorial in this video we are
00:04 - going to be creating a replica of
00:06 - bomberman inside of unity and it's going
00:09 - to look something like this once we're
00:12 - done so if I go ahead and hit play here
00:14 - we should be able to use our mouse and
00:17 - ignore this error it has something to do
00:19 - with the editor not the game I should be
00:21 - able to use on the mouse here to click
00:23 - and place bombs on different tiles and
00:26 - the bombs will then recognize where it's
00:28 - placed and create an explosion so that
00:30 - it doesn't overlap with the walls that
00:33 - it cannot destroy but it should also go
00:35 - ahead and dynamically destroy the
00:37 - elements that it can destroy so just
00:39 - like in the original Bomberman game and
00:42 - it should be really easy for you to go
00:44 - in and add a character controller here
00:46 - that goes around and places bombs
00:49 - instead of using the mouse because our
00:52 - entire environment is actually set up
00:54 - using the unity town map system so we
00:57 - are basically just modifying that at
00:59 - runtime and as you can see we do have a
01:02 - Collider in here so all of the wall
01:04 - elements and all of the destroyable
01:08 - elements here should have colliders and
01:11 - so right away if you go ahead and place
01:13 - a rigidbody in here in fact we can go
01:16 - ahead and try that but it's just try
01:17 - creating the rigidbody in here at
01:19 - runtime this is probably gonna go wrong
01:21 - but I'm just gonna do it anyway so I'm
01:23 - gonna create a 2d object sprite here and
01:26 - I'm just gonna select some kind of
01:27 - sprite let's just do a bomb whoops
01:32 - everything is not working there we go
01:34 - and we can move up the bomb here which I
01:36 - now called W let's just call it bomb and
01:39 - we place it at the top and we add a
01:43 - Collider to it so we're going to do a
01:46 - circle Collider we should actually be
01:49 - able to see this collide with our
01:51 - environment and this is not tested guys
01:54 - that I hope this will work but we're
01:55 - going to add a 2d rigidbody and there
01:57 - you go as you can see it kind of lands
01:59 - on the floor here and as you can see it
02:01 - kind of falls down and yeah so
02:03 - everything is set to work up with
02:04 - collide work with colliders and if we go
02:07 - ahead and say destroy part of the
02:08 - environment here you can see these
02:11 - colliders get removed okay that example
02:14 - it turned out way better than I thought
02:16 - it would so about that
02:18 - but yeah so let's don't dive right into
02:21 - the tutorial also towards the end we'll
02:23 - do a Q&A so make sure you to watch the
02:25 - video all the way through because we're
02:27 - going to be answering questions at the
02:29 - end like we always do so now we can go
02:33 - file open project because I've actually
02:35 - gone ahead and prepared kind of a
02:37 - starter project the reason why is I
02:39 - wanted to just include all the sprites
02:42 - I'm going to be using to have all the
02:45 - tiles set up appropriately also because
02:49 - I'm using rule tiles and I'm going to
02:51 - show you what this is in a second and
02:53 - I'm going to refer you to a video as
02:55 - well as a place where you can download
02:57 - this started project so don't worry you
02:59 - can learn all about it there's no black
03:01 - magic in this it's just for convenience
03:03 - I've gone ahead and created this project
03:05 - as you can see I already have mine
03:07 - sitting on my computer here but if you
03:10 - want to download it yourself I do have a
03:13 - link for that and for the people
03:15 - watching on YouTube there will of course
03:17 - be a link in the description and to the
03:20 - people watching on twitch I have a link
03:22 - that you can check out in the chat right
03:24 - there and I would ask the admins to go
03:28 - ahead and copy it and have it ready if
03:30 - people ask at a later point because I'm
03:32 - not going to be able to focus on pasting
03:34 - that in different places but yeah there
03:37 - is a link to the started project and
03:39 - this is what the started project looks
03:41 - like as you can see we just have a
03:44 - completely empty scene there's nothing
03:47 - in here other than a main camera but I
03:49 - also have a tile palette set up called
03:51 - Bomberman and if this window isn't open
03:54 - for you you can always go window and
03:55 - select tile palette and that should open
03:58 - it up and in here I've configured a few
04:01 - different tasks and you can see those
04:02 - under the tiles folder right here we
04:05 - have the wall tile that's that one right
04:07 - here just a static tile with a sink
04:11 - single sprite we have the destructible
04:14 - that's that one right here the same
04:16 - thing just a simple tile with a single
04:19 - sprite and then we have the dirt and
04:21 - wall filler and these are more
04:23 - complicated as you can see because these
04:25 - are what we call rule tars
04:27 - this allows these allow us to set up
04:30 - rules for how our tiles should look
04:32 - depending on how we paint with them
04:34 - depending on what tasks are nearby and
04:37 - this allows us to really easily paint
04:39 - good-looking environments where the
04:41 - tiles correspond to each other I've
04:44 - talked about how to set up tiles and how
04:46 - you can get rule tiles because it's not
04:49 - um included with unity by default and
04:52 - all that stuff and how to use tile Maps
04:54 - in general in a video I just created
04:56 - called tile Maps and unity so if you
04:59 - want to learn more about how to paint
05:01 - with tile maps and set all that stuff up
05:03 - I would definitely recommend you check
05:05 - out that video of course also have a
05:08 - link to that in the description so with
05:11 - that we can actually go out and create a
05:13 - tile map now so in order to create a
05:15 - tile map we go to the hierarchy we
05:17 - right-click we go to the object and we
05:19 - select tile map and this creates a grid
05:22 - where we can configure the size of the
05:23 - grid as well as a tile map object and as
05:27 - I've explained in the video I did a tile
05:30 - map is basically like a layer in
05:32 - Photoshop so we can go ahead and paint
05:35 - stuff onto a tile map and we can create
05:37 - multiple tile maps and layer them on top
05:39 - of each other if we want to have depth
05:43 - sort of say in our tabs so this tile map
05:47 - we can actually go ahead and paint on
05:49 - two right away we do that by selecting
05:51 - the brush tool here and hitting B we
05:53 - want to select the appropriate palettes
05:55 - here I only have one called the
05:56 - Bomberman which is included in the
05:58 - project and I'm gonna go ahead and
06:00 - select say the dirt here to the left now
06:04 - as you can see this is a rule tile and
06:07 - this means that if I go ahead and paint
06:09 - with it you can see that it
06:10 - automatically chooses a sprite that is
06:13 - appropriate for the position or for the
06:17 - on tile depending on the nearby tiles so
06:21 - that's pretty cool instead of us having
06:23 - to go in and select a corner like this
06:25 - I'd select a filler and all that stuff
06:28 - that you would normally do in order to
06:29 - create kind of corresponding tasks so
06:33 - we'll go ahead and use this to sketch
06:35 - out our level and I'm gonna make this
06:37 - fairly wide here something along these
06:39 - lines and I'm actually just going
06:41 - to make it completely square is this
06:45 - completely square this is not completely
06:47 - square this is completely square I
06:49 - believe there we go
06:51 - I'm going to hit G in order to fill out
06:53 - the entire thing there we go and and
06:57 - click with my mouse and then switch back
06:59 - to be in order to change back to brush
07:02 - mode I'm just going to make sure that
07:04 - the size of this is correct so if we
07:06 - imagine that we have walls all the way
07:09 - round here and we then go ahead and
07:11 - place one two three four wall pieces and
07:15 - then we have another wall so this is the
07:17 - correct size of the level that I want to
07:19 - make then we can select the wall filler
07:21 - this one here and I'm just gonna fill
07:24 - out with this all the way round here I'm
07:28 - actually going to do ain't no other
07:30 - patch add that just so that it isn't
07:34 - completely empty around our level so if
07:36 - we go ahead and look in the game view
07:37 - whoa for some reason our main camera is
07:41 - a bit zoomed in here and it isn't really
07:44 - positioned in a way that I'd like so I'm
07:47 - just going to take the main camera I'm
07:48 - going to move it over here by 0.5 on the
07:54 - X in order to be exact I'm also just
07:56 - going to change the size of the camera
07:58 - here in order to kind of zoom it out and
08:01 - we can also move it down by 0.5 or
08:03 - negative point 5 on the Y here just to
08:08 - Center it on our level and that actually
08:11 - looks pretty decent I'm actually going
08:13 - to zoom it in a bit more something
08:16 - around there um we can definitely go in
08:19 - here and add more wall filler in order
08:22 - to make sure that no matter what screen
08:26 - size we use that we are going to fill
08:31 - everything out with sprites so that it
08:34 - doesn't look weird angle Ichi there we
08:36 - go so now we should see that our level
08:39 - looks just fine and this is kind of the
08:41 - background of a level this is kind of
08:43 - what we want everything else to be
08:45 - painting painted on top of so we can go
08:48 - ahead and select our tile map and rename
08:50 - it to tile map underscore and I'm gonna
08:52 - call this background
08:55 - and because this is a background we are
08:57 - going to set the ordering layer for our
08:59 - talib render 2-1 so now it's going to be
09:02 - drawn underneath everything else now we
09:05 - can right click on a grid sirico 2d
09:08 - object and select tile map again and
09:10 - we've now created another layer and this
09:13 - one is going to be time app underscore
09:15 - gameplay this is where all avoid
09:17 - gameplay tiles the ones that actually
09:19 - affect our players are going to be and
09:22 - this is of course the destructible
09:24 - environment and the walls so let's start
09:27 - by painting some walls here I'm still I
09:30 - still have the brush selected but do
09:32 - note that you don't need to select the
09:34 - time app in the hierarchy instead you
09:36 - need to go under active tile map and
09:39 - choose the one that you want to paint to
09:40 - so I'm gonna change this to tile map
09:42 - game play select the wall and now I
09:46 - should be able to paint with the wall so
09:48 - I'm gonna go ahead and paint some walls
09:51 - whoops and if you missed and miss click
09:54 - or something you can always hold down
09:56 - shift in order to remove there we go and
09:59 - I'm gonna place in all of the walls
10:03 - inside of our level square here and
10:06 - there we go this now looks like a
10:08 - completely typical Bomberman level cool
10:12 - so now we've actually kind of created
10:15 - the whole base for our game this is how
10:19 - incredibly simple it can be to create
10:21 - levels using this tile map system the
10:25 - next thing that we want to do is make
10:26 - sure that all of our levels are sort or
10:28 - all of the elements in our level are
10:31 - sort of interactable in other words we
10:33 - want to add colliders to each of these
10:36 - wall pieces so that if we go ahead and
10:39 - create say a player character he will be
10:42 - able to collide with them so let's go
10:45 - ahead and hit add component and in here
10:48 - we're going to create a tile map
10:49 - Collider 2d and as you can see this goes
10:53 - ahead and actually creates you can see
10:55 - it out or outlines each one of these
10:59 - elements with a green line and this is
11:01 - of course a Collider you can also see it
11:04 - creates lines between each one of these
11:07 - elements and that's because it's
11:09 - creating a box Collider for each element
11:12 - which is not very performant so instead
11:15 - what we want to do is actually go in
11:18 - here and add another component that will
11:21 - automatically combine all these
11:24 - colliders in an effective way and this
11:27 - is what we call a I've actually forgot
11:30 - forgotten what it's called here let's go
11:33 - into physics 2d and it select the scene
11:38 - here composite Collider yes so the
11:40 - composite Collider 2d and this
11:43 - automatically creates a rigidbody and
11:45 - this doesn't mean that we need our tile
11:47 - map in to move in any way we can simply
11:49 - set the body type to static and now it
11:51 - really is as F or is as if the rigid
11:57 - body wasn't there it's not going to
11:59 - apply any forces or anything it knows
12:01 - this object is not going to move and
12:03 - then we can go to the Tom F Collider and
12:05 - we can hit used by composite and right
12:08 - away you can see all the green lines
12:11 - between the different parts disappear
12:13 - and we now have one uniform line going
12:16 - all the way around for the wall tiles
12:20 - that are next to each other and this is
12:22 - actually happening at runtime so if at
12:25 - runtime we were to change our tile map
12:27 - our composite Collider will change the
12:30 - way that it generates really cool and
12:33 - this also means that we can go ahead and
12:35 - now paint more elements so if we want to
12:37 - paint with the destructive tile here we
12:40 - can actually just go in here and as you
12:41 - can see right away the collider update
12:44 - so I'm just gonna paint a bunch of
12:47 - destructible elements in here so that we
12:51 - can see it working later and it will
12:53 - look really cool and I'm just gonna
12:55 - scatter these throughout this is not
12:58 - really about creating an interesting
12:59 - level as much as it is a demo but there
13:03 - we go we now have some elements in here
13:05 - and as you can see the collider again
13:08 - has updated for all of these one thing
13:11 - that you do need to know about when
13:13 - creating our Collider is for your tile
13:15 - map is that you need to set up what sort
13:18 - of Collider you want each town to have
13:21 - so if we go to our say
13:23 - wall here we can actually change the
13:25 - collider type of our wall and as you can
13:28 - see I've set mine to grid if you select
13:31 - none
13:31 - no colliders are going to be generated
13:34 - for this element and as you can see if I
13:36 - select it now all of the wall elements
13:38 - are ignored by our Collider this is
13:40 - definitely not what we want
13:41 - if you select sprite it's going to
13:44 - generate a Collider based on the sprite
13:46 - so for example for this destroyed wall
13:50 - part here or this destructible part it's
13:52 - actually going to generate a Collider
13:54 - that goes around all the details of the
13:56 - sprite we don't want that we simply want
13:59 - a square Collider and so we choose grid
14:02 - this simply creates a Collider that is
14:05 - completely Square and it's the same size
14:07 - as the grid element and this is what I
14:09 - want for both the wall and the
14:10 - destructible and then for the dirt and
14:13 - the wall filler not that we have are
14:16 - applying any colliders on these elements
14:18 - because they are on the background but I
14:20 - do definitely want to go ahead and
14:22 - simply set those to none I don't want
14:24 - any collision on these elements
14:26 - whatsoever so that's how you can
14:29 - configure it for individual tiles so now
14:32 - that we have set up our environment in
14:34 - the way that we want it's time to start
14:37 - actually doing things through script and
14:40 - the first thing that we want to do is
14:42 - being able to spawn in bombs
14:45 - so let's actually create a bomb to do
14:48 - that we'll go under the sprites here and
14:50 - let's take the bomb that is included in
14:54 - the project and let's drag it right into
14:56 - our scene ash oops something weird
15:02 - happened there created a material game a
15:06 - bit kind of disappeared did it make a
15:10 - tile out of it that was weird
15:13 - I have no idea what just happened
15:19 - do any of you guys it seems that the
15:21 - tile map renderer for some reason took
15:23 - on the material created for the bomb
15:26 - here okay so we are probably just gonna
15:29 - go ahead answer the experts default for
15:31 - that one and everything is back to
15:32 - normal that was very weird I have no
15:35 - idea what happened but instead
15:37 - of dragging it in here we can probably
15:39 - just drag it into the heart yes okay so
15:42 - now I created our bomb and we can see it
15:45 - in our game we also want to make sure
15:46 - that our bomb is always overlaid on top
15:48 - of our gameplay layers so let's go ahead
15:51 - and set the order in layer two one here
15:53 - then we can actually move our element
15:55 - here whoops I'm going to switch into 2d
15:58 - mode here and just that's place it at
16:01 - the center of our scene here this is
16:02 - kind of how it's going to look like or
16:04 - go to look it's this is kind of how it's
16:07 - going to look like when we create a bomb
16:09 - and the main thing that we want to
16:12 - happen for this bomb is that after a
16:15 - little while we of course want it to
16:17 - explode so we're going to have some kind
16:19 - of explosion component on our bomb
16:22 - but let's create that later for now
16:23 - let's just take this bomb and turn it
16:25 - into a prefab so let's create a folder
16:27 - inside of our project for prefabs and
16:29 - let's drag it right in there
16:33 - there we go so now we can remove it from
16:36 - our scene and we can go ahead and create
16:39 - a bomb spawner so let's right-click in
16:42 - our hierarchy create an empty object and
16:44 - this is where we'll put a bomb spawner
16:46 - let's reset the transform and call it
16:48 - bomb spawner and then we can add
16:51 - component and we're going to create a
16:53 - bomb spawner script of type C sharp and
16:56 - let's say create an ADD and now we can
16:58 - double click this to open it up in
16:59 - Visual Studio and while it's waiting or
17:04 - booting up here I'm just gonna have a
17:06 - look at the chat to see if everything is
17:08 - working looks like it that's awesome and
17:13 - yeah let's just go ahead and continue
17:15 - with the video that so the first thing
17:17 - that we want is because we are going to
17:20 - be working with Tom Maps we're going to
17:22 - be using unity engine dot tar maps you
17:27 - always always want to do this when you
17:30 - want to use tar or work with tar maps in
17:33 - scripting in unity we can however delete
17:36 - the two top namespaces there we're not
17:39 - going to be using those we can also
17:41 - remove the start function we won't be
17:43 - using that either but what we want is a
17:46 - reference to our tile map game play
17:49 - layer the reason why is that
17:51 - we go ahead and create a bomb let's say
17:55 - that we go ahead and unit is lagging out
17:59 - here so let's say that we go ahead and
18:01 - click and want to place a bomb right in
18:03 - the middle here on this tab we don't
18:06 - want the bomb to actually appear right
18:07 - where our mouse clicked that way if we
18:10 - click that in the corner here it would
18:11 - actually overlay some of the other tiles
18:13 - no we want we want it to snap to the
18:16 - center of the town that we clicked on so
18:18 - even though we click in the corner of
18:20 - the tile it should snap right to the
18:21 - center to do this we of course need a
18:24 - reference to a tile map in order to
18:25 - determine where the center of the given
18:27 - tile is so let's create a public tile
18:30 - map and this is going to be our tile map
18:34 - we can just call it bad we're also going
18:37 - to want a public game object which is
18:40 - going to be of course a reference to our
18:42 - bomb prefab what we want to actually
18:45 - spawn then inside of our update mode
18:47 - let's check if we get a mouse button
18:50 - down so if we get a mouse button press
18:52 - to do that we use input dot get mouse
18:56 - button down and the mouse button that we
18:59 - want to check for is just the left mouse
19:01 - button which is index of zero so if we
19:05 - press our left mouse button well um
19:07 - actually I just need to rearrange
19:08 - something on my other screen here one
19:10 - second okay cool so um if we press our
19:14 - mouse button we want to go ahead and
19:16 - first of all get the position that we
19:19 - pressed so we can use camera dot Maine
19:23 - dot screen to world point in order to
19:28 - convert input dot mouse position into
19:32 - world coordinates so input that Mouse
19:33 - position gives us the position of our
19:35 - mouse in screen coordinates which is the
19:38 - amount of pixels on the X and the y from
19:42 - the I think it's upper right upper left
19:45 - corner but it could be lower left corner
19:46 - but I'm pretty sure its upper left
19:48 - corner and we convert that into a well
19:51 - position by using this function then we
19:54 - can store this position as a vector
19:56 - three so we'll create a vector three
19:57 - call it world position and set it equal
20:00 - to that then we want to go ahead and
20:03 - take this world position and couldn't
20:05 - into a cell in other words what tile and
20:09 - we referred to a tile on a grid as a
20:12 - cell
20:13 - so what cell did we press well to do
20:17 - that we used another handy function
20:19 - called tile map dot world to sell this
20:23 - takes just in our ordinary world
20:25 - position and converts it to a cell
20:28 - position and a cell position is actually
20:31 - also stored oops my phone going off now
20:33 - a cell physician is actually also stored
20:36 - as a vector3 but not a normal vector
20:40 - three so we can go ahead and write back
20:42 - the three here and call it sale and set
20:44 - it equal to our map dot world to sell
20:48 - but the cell here is can actually okay
20:53 - can be stored in a vector three but what
20:55 - we normally use here is a vector three
20:57 - int and the reason why is that cells or
21:01 - cell numbers are always referred to in
21:04 - whole numbers in integers we cannot have
21:07 - a half cell so this using this data type
21:12 - here is simply faster it's simply easier
21:14 - to store because we don't need to store
21:17 - decimal places for each of the three
21:19 - numbers they all integers that's the
21:21 - only difference here and finally we need
21:24 - to get the center position of the cell
21:26 - so now we've determined on our grid here
21:28 - on our grid that we have which cell on
21:34 - this grid did we press and now we need
21:36 - to find say we press the center here now
21:39 - we need to find the center position of
21:41 - this cell and to do that we simply need
21:44 - to go tile map dot get cell center world
21:48 - and here we input again a position of
21:51 - the cell so this cell here and this is
21:54 - going to again be a vector3 and for this
21:57 - we of course want to have decimal places
21:59 - so it's going to be a normal vector
22:00 - three and we'll call this the cell
22:02 - center position all right so now we've
22:07 - chewed through kind of all the
22:08 - calculations that we need to do first
22:10 - converting from our screen space which
22:14 - is where our mouse position is to a
22:16 - world position that's what we do here
22:19 - then converting from a well position to
22:21 - a cell defining the right cell then
22:24 - converting from the cell to the center
22:27 - well position of that cell and finally
22:29 - we can go ahead and instantiate our bond
22:31 - so we can instantiate a bond prefab add
22:34 - these cells Center position with no
22:37 - rotation so catonian dot identity and if
22:40 - we now say this and go into unity and
22:43 - hit play we should see that we have no
22:48 - errors fingers crossed
22:50 - okay so I clicked play twice so it
22:53 - actually unplayed but now if I click OK
22:57 - I know that we're gonna get an error now
22:59 - because we didn't actually refer it to
23:01 - the bomb prefab so there we go but it is
23:04 - working I promise you so we can go back
23:07 - into a bond spawner we need to reference
23:09 - first of all our tile map which is going
23:11 - to be Tama up gameplay and then under
23:14 - prefabs we're going to reference or bomb
23:16 - prefab there we go and if we now it play
23:19 - I am try and place a bomb yes so you can
23:24 - see no matter where I press on some of
23:26 - these tiles a bomb is actually going to
23:28 - be pressed of course it doesn't explode
23:29 - yet but that is kind of an introduction
23:32 - to working with some of these positions
23:33 - when it comes to toss how do you place
23:37 - game objects on tiles how do you kind of
23:39 - refactor some of these positional data
23:42 - so yeah that I think that was a pretty
23:44 - important thing to learn when working
23:47 - with on tile Maps you will also note
23:49 - that we can place bombs on pretty much
23:51 - all tiles in our entire tile map so
23:54 - we're not really doing any checking to
23:56 - see if the place is bomb compatible and
23:59 - you could definitely do that but I don't
24:02 - think it's important here because the
24:03 - only thing that's going to be placing
24:05 - bombs is your character and he's never
24:07 - going to be able to move to these
24:09 - locations so yeah you might do that if
24:12 - you want to go all in but I don't think
24:15 - it's necessarily something you need to
24:18 - do cool so now that we are placing bombs
24:22 - in the right positions it's time to go
24:23 - ahead and make these bombs explode and
24:26 - of course in order to make them explode
24:29 - we need to have some kind of a countdown
24:30 - timer but right before we create that
24:32 - I'm just going
24:33 - have a look in the chat here and see if
24:35 - I'm still streaming or if I'm just
24:36 - talking to myself okay so things things
24:40 - are going good
24:41 - awesome the next thing that we will do
24:45 - is create a bomb script so we'll go to
24:47 - our prefabs bomb and we'll create
24:50 - another component here and this is going
24:52 - to be the bomb script oops
24:56 - bomb and will it create an ad and we'll
24:59 - double click it to open it up in Visual
25:01 - Studio and this is definitely going to
25:03 - be this simplest script that we'll be
25:05 - riding today the only thing that we want
25:07 - to do is replace the start method with
25:10 - some kind of public float which we'll
25:13 - call our countdown and will default this
25:16 - to say two seconds then inside our
25:18 - update method so every frame we want to
25:21 - go ahead and reduce our countdown by
25:23 - time.deltatime in other words each
25:27 - second we're going to reduce a countdown
25:29 - variable by one and so this is going to
25:32 - count down for two seconds and we can go
25:35 - ahead and check if countdown gues
25:38 - reaches zero or goes below zero well
25:42 - then we actually want to go ahead and
25:44 - explode but before we do that we
25:48 - actually need some way of having the
25:51 - bomb explode so right now let's just
25:53 - write a debugger lock saying boom as
25:58 - well as a destroy call oops
26:02 - I did not improve the correct symbol
26:05 - there as well as a destroy hold that is
26:08 - going to remove this game object so
26:10 - right after we say boom in the console
26:13 - we're going to destroy the bomb game
26:15 - object and it's going to be no more cool
26:18 - so let's say that and let's make sure
26:20 - that it's applied to a prefab and
26:22 - everything and that we get no errors yes
26:28 - and then we can hit play and now we
26:31 - should be able to see that if I click
26:34 - wait two seconds it says boom and the
26:37 - bomb is gone perfect so now we have the
26:41 - kind of timing of the bombs are
26:43 - perfected and the only thing
26:45 - left really now is creating the actual
26:48 - map destroy a script and I'm just gonna
26:52 - go ahead and place this on the grid but
26:54 - you can really place it anywhere that
26:56 - you'd like let's call it map destroyer
26:59 - destroy your and let's say create an ad
27:03 - and it's double-click it to open it up
27:05 - and this is going to be a bit longer
27:08 - this script but it's not necessarily
27:10 - going to be more complicated than what
27:12 - we've already done so the first thing
27:16 - that we want to do is get rid of both of
27:18 - functions we're not going to be using
27:19 - any of the default unity functions we'll
27:22 - also go ahead and use unity engine you
27:26 - guessed it dart tar maps and finally
27:31 - we're going to get a reference a public
27:33 - tile map to a tunnel and we can just go
27:38 - ahead and call that town map as well
27:40 - because we are going to be modifying our
27:42 - gameplay tile map so we need a reference
27:44 - to our gameplay tile map and now we need
27:48 - a couple of functions let's create a
27:51 - public void which we'll call explode and
27:55 - this is going to take in a vector two
27:58 - with the position where we want to
28:02 - explode and this is going to be a
28:05 - position in world coordinates so we
28:08 - could also just call this world pause
28:10 - just to be a tiny more tiny bit more
28:14 - specific that's probably a good idea and
28:16 - the first thing that we want to go and
28:18 - do is convert this world position that
28:21 - gets inputted into this function into a
28:25 - cell the cell of the origin of the
28:28 - explosion so we'll create so we'll use
28:31 - tile map dot world to sell in order to
28:34 - find the right cell will input the world
28:37 - position that was passed in and we'll go
28:40 - ahead and store this as again a vector3
28:42 - int called the origin cell which just
28:47 - looks or sounds so incredibly cold
28:51 - origins cell it sounds like something
28:53 - taken right out of the matrix we've
28:55 - achieved the origin cell and we're ready
28:57 - to proceed all right
28:59 - okay that's probably the most nerdiest
29:01 - thing I've said today but it will
29:02 - continue so with this origin cell we
29:05 - need to go ahead and of course explode
29:07 - the cell that the bomb is on but we also
29:10 - want to explode the I'm gonna go ahead
29:13 - and show you this we of course going to
29:16 - explode the cell that the bomb gets
29:18 - placed on but we also want to explode
29:20 - the two cells above this bomb the two
29:23 - cells to the right of this bomb two to
29:26 - the two down and two to the left so
29:30 - let's create a function for exploding a
29:33 - particular cell and then simply call
29:35 - that function with a tiny bit of offset
29:38 - from the origin cell so one one offset
29:41 - on the X to offset on the x one offset
29:43 - on the y to offset on the Y and so on so
29:45 - let's go ahead and create a public
29:47 - another function in here this doesn't
29:49 - need to be public we can just call it
29:51 - make it of a void private void
29:55 - call it explode cell and this is of
29:59 - course going to take in the cell that we
30:01 - want to explore it so a vector3 int
30:03 - called sale and here we go ahead and
30:10 - explode your appropriate cell and the
30:13 - way that we want to do this is first to
30:15 - convert this position or this cell
30:18 - number into an actual top so we need to
30:23 - figure out the data of the cell that
30:26 - this that we're trying to explode so to
30:31 - 'try to achieve the town with a certain
30:34 - cell index what we do is use tom ab get
30:38 - tau and here we feed it simply the cell
30:43 - so simply the position of the top we
30:46 - also need to make sure to convert this
30:48 - because by default this is going to give
30:51 - us what is called a table base so this
30:54 - is going to give us a tall base and a
30:57 - table base is basically just the class
31:00 - that all tile types derive from so by
31:04 - default right now unity just comes with
31:06 - a single tile that derived from tower
31:09 - base and that's just called tau it's the
31:12 - basic table it has the
31:13 - stride a collider that's pretty much it
31:16 - and you can place it in your tile map
31:17 - but I think with time unity is going to
31:19 - be adding multiple kinds of tasks such
31:22 - as ruler tiles which I've included in
31:25 - this project here and you can get from
31:27 - from a github repository that unity has
31:30 - made animated tasks terrain tiles all
31:34 - that kind of stuff as well as you can
31:37 - also create your own tiles that derive
31:39 - from tile base so that's all good but
31:43 - Todd base doesn't actually give us a lot
31:47 - of information about the tile in fact
31:49 - the only thing that it gives us is kind
31:50 - of just a name and the ability to get
31:53 - some more data but that's all very
31:54 - complicated instead what we want to do
31:57 - is actually retrieve the top so we want
32:00 - to be more specific and say hey we just
32:02 - we don't just want to get any tile
32:04 - deriving from tile base we want to only
32:07 - get a top as in the tile that we've gone
32:11 - ahead and created here the destructible
32:12 - and wall this is not gonna work for rule
32:15 - tile because rule tiles are also derived
32:17 - from tile base but their rule tiles not
32:20 - just tasks I know this is very confusing
32:22 - but we want to get the destructible and
32:25 - wall tiles and so we want to be specific
32:28 - that we want to get a tower and so we
32:30 - can actually specify that right here we
32:32 - want to get a tile of the type tile and
32:36 - if you wanted to get a rule tile you can
32:37 - get a ton of the tithe rule tile so this
32:42 - is where you specify what you want to
32:43 - get so we want to get a towel
32:45 - and we'll call it tile and it's going to
32:47 - be of type tile tile tile tile so now
32:55 - that we've gotten the towel at the right
32:57 - position what we want to do is do some
33:01 - checking on this we want to check is
33:03 - this a wall tile in which case we want
33:05 - to stop the explosion right there is
33:07 - this a destructible tile in which case
33:10 - we want to go ahead and well destroy it
33:12 - and we can even check if the towel
33:15 - simply doesn't exist so in order to do
33:19 - that what we want to do is simply go up
33:22 - here and create a few references we want
33:25 - to create a reference to the
33:28 - destructible tile as well as the wall
33:31 - tile so that we can compare the tile
33:33 - that we want to explode to those two and
33:35 - check if they're the same so here we can
33:37 - create a public towel and we'll call
33:40 - this all tile as well as a public tile
33:44 - that will call destructible tile and
33:48 - then down here we can simply check if
33:50 - the town that we're looking at so if
33:52 - tile is equal to wall tile well then we
33:57 - don't want to do anything because we
33:58 - cannot destroy walls so we simply going
34:01 - to return out of the function we also
34:03 - check if the tile is equal to a
34:05 - destructible tile in which case we are
34:09 - going to go ahead and actually change
34:11 - the tile to remove or in actually we're
34:15 - not just going to change it we're going
34:17 - to remove the top I'm going to show you
34:19 - how to do that in a second
34:21 - then finally if it's not a wall tile but
34:25 - if it's a destructible tile or there is
34:27 - no tile well then we want to go ahead
34:29 - and create an explosion on the top and
34:34 - then we can simply empty function so
34:38 - this is how we would kind of construct
34:40 - it this is how we can get a towel and
34:42 - find out what tile we're working with
34:44 - and in the case that we want to destroy
34:47 - the tile what we do is using tile map
34:52 - dot set tile and this is pretty much the
34:56 - equivalent of the function up here here
34:58 - we get a towel at the certain position
35:00 - here we set a towel at a certain
35:02 - position at first we give it the
35:03 - position so cell and then we give it the
35:07 - new tile that we wanted to be so here we
35:09 - could set it to a wall tile if we wanted
35:11 - to we could set it to a destructible
35:13 - tile any other tile if you reference it
35:15 - or we could simply set it to null in
35:18 - order to remove it and that's what we
35:20 - want to do here so if we say this we
35:25 - should actually be able to call this
35:27 - function and let's actually just try and
35:29 - do that so for now we can maybe just
35:32 - call it on the origin cell so up here we
35:34 - can say explode cell and we just want to
35:37 - explode our origin cell if we now save
35:40 - this and
35:41 - and we select our grid and under our map
35:46 - destroyer we should get to three fields
35:48 - here the first one is we need to
35:50 - reference our town map gameplay the
35:52 - second is we want a reference to a wall
35:54 - tile as well as the destructible tile
35:56 - and if we now play we should see that if
36:01 - I place a palm here right on top of some
36:06 - dirt it should remove that dirt don't
36:10 - know why it didn't remove that dirt oh
36:11 - because we also need to of course call
36:13 - this function I'm being stupid so we
36:16 - actually also need to go into our bomb
36:18 - and instead of just debug dead logging
36:21 - boom we need to call this explode
36:24 - function and for now we can just use
36:27 - find object of type map destroyer in
36:31 - order to get a reference to this script
36:34 - and then simply use dot explode and then
36:38 - we'll give it our current position so
36:40 - transform dot position of course I would
36:44 - recommend you to use a singleton here
36:46 - instead I've shown you how to create
36:48 - very simple singleton patterns before if
36:50 - you want to know more about what
36:51 - Singleton's are I love also have a link
36:54 - for that in the description if you're
36:55 - watching on YouTube but it's basically
36:57 - just a more efficient way of getting a
36:59 - reference to a script that is only that
37:02 - only exists once inside the scene and
37:05 - it's a very complicated sentence but
37:07 - basically it just is more performant
37:09 - than this line of code right here so I
37:13 - would recommend you add that but this is
37:15 - not what the video is about so we're
37:17 - just going to do it this way and find
37:18 - the object each time so now we called
37:21 - explode on the map destroyer every time
37:24 - our bomb is ready to explode if we save
37:28 - that and hit play we should now be able
37:32 - to do this thing that I was trying to do
37:33 - before which is place a bomb on top of
37:36 - some destructible piece of environment
37:38 - and it should remove it if we pray place
37:41 - it on some dirt nothing happens and if
37:44 - we place it on a wall nothing happens so
37:47 - it only destroys destructible tiles
37:49 - that's because inside of our function in
37:52 - the map Destroyer it checks if the tile
37:54 - is
37:55 - distractible town and if it is it
37:57 - removes it so it says something about
38:00 - this working let's also go ahead and
38:02 - create an explosion each time just to
38:04 - make this more visible and it I think
38:06 - it's going to help us when we try and
38:08 - explode more cells so to create an
38:11 - explosion we really just need a
38:13 - reference to a prefab that we can spawn
38:16 - in and we can go ahead and create that
38:18 - here so we'll create a public game
38:19 - object and we'll call it explosion
38:22 - prefab and then down here when we want
38:26 - to create the explosion we first want to
38:29 - change the cell here to a world position
38:33 - so we can use Tom app dot cell to world
38:38 - and we'll give it our cell here and then
38:42 - we can we actually also need to offset
38:45 - this a little bit and before we use this
38:49 - let me find it here this gets tells
38:52 - Center world and I think we need to use
38:54 - that also here actually instead so let's
38:56 - use dot get cell Center world yes yes
39:04 - this is what we need to use and here we
39:06 - simply input this cell cool that's the
39:10 - right function because this will get the
39:12 - center of the cell and this is where we
39:14 - want to instantiate our explosion so
39:16 - this is going to be a victor three that
39:18 - will called
39:19 - position what's that equal to the result
39:22 - there and then we can instantiate an
39:24 - explosion prefab add the position with
39:27 - no rotation so quaternion identity let's
39:31 - save that go into unity select our grid
39:35 - wait for it to refresh here there we go
39:40 - now we can drag in a prefab but of
39:43 - course we need to create this explosion
39:45 - prefab and I've gone ahead and imported
39:47 - some sprites for the explosion here as
39:50 - well by the way all these sprites here
39:52 - the dirt explosion and mold are also
39:55 - included in some of the unity example
39:57 - scene so they are created by unity so in
40:01 - here we can go to the sprite editor and
40:03 - as you can see it's automatically laid
40:06 - out all the individuals rights
40:08 - for this explosion so whoops and if we
40:13 - close this right editor we can see each
40:15 - of them here and in order to make an
40:18 - animation out of these we simply need to
40:20 - select all them by holding down shift
40:22 - and drag them into our hierarchy and
40:25 - this is going to prompt us to create an
40:27 - animation let's create a new folder for
40:29 - this which we'll call animation and
40:32 - let's call it the explosion animation
40:36 - let's save and now it creates this
40:40 - explosion on this course zero object
40:42 - we're simply going to rename this to
40:44 - explosion there we go and if we go into
40:49 - the animation window we can go window
40:51 - and image animation there we go we can
40:57 - now scrub through and see the animation
41:00 - asset place and we can just hit play
41:02 - here if you want to preview it in real
41:04 - time so now we have an animation I just
41:07 - want to make sure that at the end here
41:09 - we add a final key frame that gets rid
41:11 - of the smoke so that when it plays all
41:13 - the way through it disappears so I'm
41:15 - just gonna hit record here go place it
41:19 - right at the end of our animation and go
41:22 - ahead and set the sprite to none and so
41:25 - now it should insert so that if we play
41:27 - through the animation and it ends here
41:29 - there we go it's gone and finally we can
41:32 - go under the animation here and select
41:34 - the clip explosion on our arm there we
41:38 - go explosion and we want to disable loop
41:40 - time so now our animation won't loop it
41:43 - will just play once and then it won't be
41:46 - visible anymore so now we have our
41:48 - explosion and we can actually go out and
41:51 - make a prefab out of this as well and we
41:54 - can remove it from our scene and now if
41:57 - we go under our grid and drag in our
42:00 - explosion prefab that we just created
42:02 - hit play and place it place a bomb
42:08 - somewhere in our scene we should see
42:09 - there we go
42:10 - we now have an explosion effect and of
42:13 - course it's currently only right on top
42:15 - of the bomb but we can simply go ahead
42:17 - and call the same explode so function
42:21 - just like we do
42:22 - and then simply offset it to the up to
42:26 - the right to the left and down in order
42:28 - to create more explosions of the same
42:29 - kind and we can do this really easily
42:32 - but first I just want to have a look at
42:35 - the chat here to see how everyone is
42:38 - doing looks good I hope I hope you guys
42:41 - are able to to follow along I know this
42:44 - down video is kind of all over the place
42:46 - right now but the Talmud system is all
42:48 - new and interesting and I thought I
42:50 - would cover it as much as possible
42:54 - really don't mind it if if you aren't
42:59 - able to follow along with with
43:00 - everything you'll learn with time this
43:02 - is really just an introduction but yeah
43:05 - it looks like everything is good in the
43:07 - chat so we can go ahead and continue and
43:10 - so I wanted to go ahead and call the
43:13 - explode cell here and then simply offset
43:15 - it to go up and to the right and down
43:17 - and to the left and to do this we can
43:19 - simply copy this experts a call and then
43:23 - simply add a tiny
43:26 - offset on to our origin cell position so
43:30 - we'll do plus new vector3 int and here
43:35 - we can then offset it on the x y&z so
43:39 - and of course first we want to go ahead
43:42 - and offset it by 1 on the X 0 on the Y
43:46 - and 0 on the Z and we can go ahead and
43:49 - copy this a bunch of times so then we
43:53 - want to go to on the X then we want to
43:58 - go 0 on the X and 1 on the y then we
44:02 - want to go 0 on the X and 2 on the Y and
44:07 - you're kind of getting the system here
44:09 - however we don't want to offset it on
44:11 - the Z because we're not really working
44:13 - with depth in that way instead what we
44:15 - want to do is offset it by negative 1
44:17 - and negative 2 on the X and then do the
44:21 - same thing on the Y here so negative 1
44:25 - on the Y and negative 2 on the Y in
44:28 - other words plus 1 plus 1 on the Y plus
44:33 - 1 plus 2 on the X negative 1
44:36 - negative 2 on the Y negative 2 1
44:39 - negative 2 on the X so that's how we are
44:41 - getting this pattern and we should now
44:44 - see actually that if we just say this
44:47 - and go in and play and place a bomb it
44:50 - should work right off the bat so if we
44:52 - place a bomb here now we get this lovely
44:55 - explosion effect it removes the part of
44:57 - the environment that we want whoops I
45:00 - shouldn't place it on top of that but
45:01 - you can see it working the only problem
45:03 - with this is that if we place it
45:05 - somewhere where it should actually be
45:07 - blocked by a wall say here you can see
45:11 - that the explosion doesn't actually
45:13 - trigger on the wall but it goes through
45:16 - to the other side and this is of course
45:20 - not something we want you want walls to
45:22 - be able to accept like an explosion so
45:26 - how do we do that well we can actually
45:28 - do it fairly simply we can do it by
45:31 - using a return type to this function in
45:34 - other words instead of returning nothing
45:36 - we'll go ahead and return a ball and
45:39 - this pool is going to indicate it's
45:43 - going to indicate whether or not on the
45:46 - explosion was blocked by a wall so in
45:50 - the case that we hit a wall tile we're
45:53 - going to return false because the
45:56 - explosion didn't happen here and so we
45:58 - don't want it to continue in the case
46:01 - that we didn't in other words we reach
46:03 - this point in the code we're going to
46:05 - return true because the explosion did
46:08 - happen and we didn't hit a wall and so
46:10 - we want the explosion to continue so
46:12 - this pool here is just do we want to
46:15 - continue our explosion in the given
46:17 - direction and we can then use that up
46:19 - here so this actually gives a ball now
46:21 - we can use collect it in or we can store
46:25 - it as a pool variable called should
46:28 - continue and set it equal like that and
46:33 - then we can use an if statement but we
46:35 - don't actually need to store each one of
46:37 - them in a variable instead we can simply
46:39 - do a if statement and then wrap the
46:42 - explosion in that and I know it looks
46:45 - kind of confusing but this actually does
46:47 - the same thing so right here we are
46:48 - calling the
46:50 - load cell and we're saying that if it
46:53 - returns true well then we want to go
46:55 - ahead and explode the next cell in the
46:57 - same direction and we want to go ahead
47:00 - and do that for each given direction so
47:02 - if explode cell on the Y here it's true
47:07 - well then we want to explode this second
47:09 - cell on the Y and we just go through and
47:12 - do this for each one of them so if
47:14 - whoops don't want to manually write this
47:16 - when you can do that if explode cell on
47:20 - negative x here we'll want to explode
47:24 - the second one and if explode cell on
47:26 - the first negative Y well then we want
47:31 - to explode this second cell on the
47:33 - negative Y there we go and that should
47:37 - actually do all of the appropriate
47:40 - checking for us of course you could use
47:42 - Ray casts and colliders and complicate
47:44 - yourself in all kinds of ways but this
47:46 - does the exact same thing and sometimes
47:48 - this is what you have to do if you're
47:49 - used to working with unity and kind of
47:52 - thinking about these problems in an
47:54 - abstract three-dimensional ways such as
47:56 - we need to determine if something is
47:58 - blocking this explosion we send out a
48:00 - ray to determine this much of this stuff
48:03 - can be avoided if you just take a step
48:05 - back and look at the problem and say
48:08 - well everything is on a grid and that
48:11 - just simply simplifies so many things so
48:14 - here we got away by using not using ray
48:17 - casts and simply writing out of some of
48:19 - this code and it's actually very
48:21 - effective because we're only returning a
48:24 - boolean here so it shouldn't really cost
48:26 - too much
48:27 - performance-wise yeah as you can see I'm
48:30 - pretty satisfied with this piece of
48:31 - course so let's go ahead and hit play
48:35 - and now we should see that if we place
48:38 - it say here it should get blocked here
48:41 - and indeed it does if we place it
48:43 - between two walls the explosion doesn't
48:46 - go through and that's actually the end
48:48 - of what I wanted to show you we can now
48:50 - place bombs all over the place and they
48:53 - should interact appropriately you can
48:55 - also see that the bomb right now doesn't
48:58 - trigger if an explosion hits it you can
49:00 - have some bombs trigger other bombs it's
49:02 - that if that
49:03 - something you want we can also just
49:05 - change the order so it doesn't look bad
49:07 - as it does right now so in here the palm
49:10 - county has an ordering layer of one
49:12 - let's go ahead and set the explosions
49:14 - over in the year two three so now the
49:15 - explosion overlays all of the objects
49:18 - and we should see that if we placed two
49:20 - bombs next to each other it looks a bit
49:22 - better when they explode so yeah that's
49:25 - just a tiny fix really from here it's up
49:27 - to you to go ahead and add some kind of
49:29 - character controller and you can you
49:31 - make him rigidbody enabled because
49:33 - everything is set up to work with
49:34 - colliders it's about adding power-ups we
49:38 - have a video on YouTube that we did
49:42 - recently on creating power-ups for games
49:44 - so if that's something you want to add
49:46 - to your game definitely check out that
49:48 - video and if you have any more questions
49:50 - about tile maps I also did a video
49:53 - specifically on creating and modifying
49:55 - tar maps unity and creating your own
49:57 - custom tiles importing tile sets so if
50:00 - you want to use your own sprites and not
50:01 - my example project here definitely check
50:04 - out that video as well so I think that's
50:06 - pretty much all the video shoutouts that
50:07 - I could think of right now and yeah I
50:10 - hope you guys enjoyed this video I think
50:12 - it was a pretty exciting little project
50:14 - to make and it's something that I've
50:16 - been wanting to do ever since I heard
50:17 - unity was working on a tile map system I
50:19 - thought Bomberman this will be the bomb
50:22 - no pun intended
50:24 - so um cool yeah that's pretty much the
50:27 - end of the road for the tutorial I think
50:31 - we are ready to go to the Q&A so hello
50:36 - everyone in chat I am all ready to do
50:39 - more talking luckily I've got some water
50:44 - with me and at this point you are or
50:47 - completely free la can't talk anymore
50:51 - feel free at this point to ask questions
50:54 - I will do my best to answer them
50:56 - anything at all try and avoid duplicate
51:00 - questions twine about try and avoid ants
51:03 - spamming them in fact don't spam at all
51:07 - but yeah just ask away
51:11 - I'm here cool so I'm gonna take it to
51:14 - the water
51:17 - and all of you guys have some questions
51:19 - for me they can be technical
51:21 - non-technical personal why are you using
51:26 - Victor 3 and instead of Victor - int
51:29 - that's a good question the reason why is
51:31 - that inside of the art or using the time
51:37 - app API things actually come back with
51:40 - the C position as well and I think this
51:42 - has to do with ordering for different
51:44 - tasks on the same layer I think you are
51:45 - able to do something along those lines
51:47 - I'm not completely sure but for some
51:50 - reason it does return a vector3 and with
51:52 - the Z position in our example everything
51:54 - is at zero so I'm sure that you could
51:56 - use vector to end and it would
51:58 - automatically convert it to that just
52:01 - didn't see a reason - how should I start
52:04 - at learning low poly modeling in blender
52:06 - well actually do have a tutorial series
52:09 - on creating a low poly model that is
52:12 - came ready in blender so you can check
52:14 - that out but really it's just about
52:16 - start starting to create some of these
52:18 - things just downloading blender open it
52:23 - up being complete idiot and don't know
52:26 - where anything is and just take it from
52:29 - there it's about practice really but
52:31 - there are some really good blender
52:33 - tutorials online not only this series
52:35 - that I did
52:37 - hey Braga's do have some good links
52:39 - about the API of unity networking sorry
52:44 - not off the top of my head know what is
52:46 - your call and using interfaces in a
52:48 - unity game I use them for some of my
52:52 - games
52:53 - I think interfaces for me is for I
52:59 - should wear this differently I normally
53:01 - only use interfaces very rarely and the
53:05 - reason why is that when I make a game
53:09 - most of the time it's smaller projects
53:11 - and it's game jam projects or tutorial
53:13 - projects and in those it's not often
53:15 - that I need the functionality of
53:16 - interfaces because most of what
53:19 - interfaces are used for our writing
53:22 - solid code especially if you have a
53:25 - large code base or if you're working
53:27 - multiple people on a project
53:29 - often doesn't make sense if you're
53:30 - trying to do something as quickly as
53:31 - possible and so I don't often use them
53:33 - but they can be really really useful
53:35 - they can also be a trap so they're great
53:39 - if you know what you're doing
53:41 - would you like to create a video
53:43 - tutorial on photon multiplayer maybe at
53:45 - some point I heard photon is great are
53:48 - you going to make a chess game in the
53:50 - next live stream because I think it's an
53:51 - easy thing to make chess could be fun
53:55 - I've never thought of it as easy but I
53:59 - guess with this time app system it
54:01 - wouldn't be that hard that's actually a
54:04 - very good idea I will write it down no
54:09 - promises but I'll write it out do you
54:11 - make an Android tutorial I try not to
54:13 - make platform-specific tutorials too
54:14 - much do publish games
54:16 - I don't publish finished games no I do
54:18 - create smaller projects for tutorials
54:20 - and game jams if you want to check out
54:22 - my games you can go to the aloo Matar a
54:24 - website or just search for brekkie
54:26 - student diary and they should appear how
54:29 - about footprint tutorial that could
54:30 - definitely be exciting creating some
54:32 - kind of custom shader for that could be
54:33 - fun they're going to make some Android
54:35 - tutor again same thing as before can you
54:38 - make a bazooka to talk Wow
54:40 - bazookas could be cool I really want to
54:42 - do that I don't think I think it's a bit
54:46 - too close to something I've done before
54:47 - I've created a tutorial on creating
54:49 - grenades in unity that actually destroys
54:51 - part of the environment so I think you
54:55 - could check that out and then simply
54:57 - instead of having a grenade model just
55:00 - have a missile model that just threw a
55:05 - shoot through the level with some
55:06 - particles and something I've pretty much
55:08 - the same thing do you have any idea to
55:13 - do tutorials on an open-world game no
55:17 - that is simply too complex and requires
55:19 - way too much asset creation will you do
55:23 - some tutorials and databases if I was
55:25 - better at databases I probably would
55:27 - however I mean anything can they depends
55:30 - on if you mean local and network
55:31 - databases anything networked is
55:33 - something I suck at local database is
55:36 - there a bunch of stuff that you can do
55:37 - there with JSON and XML or scriptable
55:41 - objects I will
55:42 - have a tutorial on scriptable objects
55:43 - that I suggest to check out if you want
55:44 - to create a local database or just easy
55:48 - way of storing or creating data objects
55:54 - in unity you can check out my scribble
55:56 - objects video but networks probably not
55:59 - right now can you do some advanced 2d
56:01 - tutorials I don't know about you guys
56:05 - but I thought this was fairly advanced I
56:07 - know that there's a lot more that you
56:09 - can do with the Tal map system but it's
56:12 - probably just because I've never used it
56:13 - before but I was researching this and I
56:16 - was confused at some points mostly with
56:19 - the relationship between tiles and and
56:22 - how you're supposed to go about
56:23 - everything but yeah but I would love to
56:27 - do some more advanced stuff at some
56:28 - point do you have any idea to make basic
56:31 - copy protection for unity games nope
56:33 - sorry why gravity not working with
56:36 - animated component if you're over I
56:41 - don't know this this completely depends
56:44 - on the setup of your project but if you
56:46 - are overriding positions of a game
56:48 - object then physics aren't going to work
56:52 - you can physics enable your animation so
56:56 - that physics get applied on top of your
56:58 - animations you shouldn't be modifying
57:00 - the brute position of your object
57:02 - anyways through animation that is my
57:05 - answer
57:06 - can you do a 2d tutorial in the style of
57:08 - Castle Crashers don't starve slash don't
57:11 - starve where there is some depth not
57:17 - completely sure what you mean but those
57:19 - games are awesome and I could maybe do
57:22 - something along those lines
57:24 - yeah what is the best way to make in
57:28 - this run and spawned objects pose yes
57:31 - object pools are basically made for
57:35 - endless runners they are the best
57:37 - example of where you could use object
57:39 - pools so definitely check out my new
57:41 - video on object pooling yay and if you
57:44 - want to learn about some of the other
57:47 - stuff on creating it this runner check
57:49 - out the how to making video game series
57:50 - which shows that can you test our games
57:54 - we
57:55 - actually talking about doing a
57:56 - livestream earlier today after Ludum
58:00 - dare a where I play your games an entire
58:02 - livestream reserved for Christians and
58:05 - answers and just having fun and playing
58:07 - some of the games that you guys create
58:09 - that is something that I really want to
58:11 - do so I'll try to make Ori to set that
58:16 - up only if you guys want to see it if
58:19 - you let me know actually right now is
58:21 - that something you would like to see
58:22 - where we just take some time an hour or
58:24 - so where we sit down and chill and you
58:27 - guys send me some of the games that you
58:29 - make and I can maybe give some feedback
58:31 - and try them out and suck at them live
58:33 - and embarrass myself go cry in the
58:35 - corner now that I think about it it
58:38 - sounds great
58:40 - do you want to create a shaded tutorial
58:43 - series
58:43 - yes especially with the new shader graph
58:45 - I've never been a technical artist per
58:49 - se and so my shader writing knowledge is
58:52 - limited and you know some stuff but not
58:55 - all of it definitely and I would love to
58:58 - cover the new shader graph because
59:00 - they're going to I think it's going to
59:01 - be pretty much the standard standard of
59:04 - how people are going to make be making
59:06 - shaders in unity soon yeah I don't see a
59:10 - lot of people scripting their own
59:14 - shaders with this new tall vegetation
59:20 - and realistic environment on unity and
59:22 - that's something that could be really
59:23 - interested doing something some of this
59:26 - photogrammetry stuff in unity showing
59:28 - off stuff like mega scans or doing a
59:33 - video one on PBR and and some of those
59:35 - rendering techniques but a lot of this
59:38 - stuff is happening to unity right now
59:40 - especially with the scriptable render
59:41 - pipeline so I wouldn't want to go too
59:43 - much into detail before we know kind of
59:46 - how it's RP is going to turn out and how
59:49 - the new graphics workflow and unity is
59:51 - going to be things are still kind of
59:54 - unknown because things are in early beta
59:56 - and so um do you have any
60:01 - recommendations for someone someone
60:04 - wanting to study in Denmark coming from
60:06 - Portugal
60:09 - recommendations yeah I think what I
60:15 - would probably do is is try and go to
60:18 - people in order to make friends because
60:21 - we Danes we tend to kind of not be too
60:24 - good at being the ones that has the
60:27 - incentive to you know actually go and
60:30 - talk to people we tend to kind of shield
60:32 - ourselves and only talk to the ones that
60:34 - we know I know when you talk to
60:35 - ourselves if we are weird like I am and
60:37 - then but but really most people if you
60:40 - just come and talk to them they enjoy it
60:43 - we do enjoy it we just don't do it I
60:46 - don't know why so that would probably be
60:48 - the main thing is just go and talk to
60:51 - people that way you're going to have
60:53 - friends because otherwise yeah and go to
60:57 - social events try and find some mom some
61:01 - circles of people that you think could
61:04 - be like-minded I think that's probably
61:07 - the main thing moving to another country
61:08 - is try and build a network what do you
61:13 - recommend for learning more about
61:14 - shaders right now there are of course a
61:19 - bunch of good resources for shader
61:21 - writing I would mostly recommend stuff
61:25 - like cat like so cat like coding Ellen's
61:28 - Taccone and making stuff look good on
61:32 - YouTube there was some I three can you
61:36 - make us a turtle for survival games I
61:38 - already have a huge series on creating a
61:41 - survival game in unity guys come on
61:42 - it's like 35 videos long or something
61:45 - but and I'm not gonna touch it anymore
61:47 - I'm sorry it's it's too old it's
61:49 - outdated and I think it's more exciting
61:51 - to do different kind of projects you can
61:53 - go watch that to get some inspiration at
61:55 - least I'm sorry that it's old and in
61:57 - JavaScript but yeah but really a
62:02 - survival game is in much way in many
62:07 - ways the same as kind of it kind of a
62:09 - mix between a first-person shooter and
62:12 - an RPG so you can check out my
62:15 - multiplayer first tutorial and my RPG
62:18 - tutorial and try and combine the two in
62:21 - a way that
62:22 - sex that would probably be my
62:24 - recommendation what games to play
62:26 - yourself I play a lot of games I don't
62:28 - have time to play them but I try and
62:31 - play a lot of games this is what I
62:33 - should say so right now or for a long
62:38 - time now my big passion has been csgo
62:41 - Counter Strike global Offensive it's
62:43 - just so fun and I often I'm kind of a
62:47 - social game and most of the time when I
62:48 - play it with friends and it's such a fun
62:50 - competitive game so we play that a lot
62:52 - historically I've played a huge amount
62:55 - of World of Warcraft
62:56 - what if I was able to take all the hours
62:58 - that I put into World of Warcraft and
63:00 - put them into a actually useful skill I
63:02 - would be the world's best guitarist but
63:07 - yeah those are two that I've spent a lot
63:10 - of time on but I also try and play
63:13 - smaller games I just replayed a super
63:17 - meatboy which was really fun I haven't
63:19 - played that for a very long time and
63:22 - recently I played all the way through
63:24 - Ori and the blind forest which is such a
63:28 - good game I couldn't recommend it enough
63:30 - and I'm looking so much forward to full
63:31 - of the wisps on this the second one and
63:34 - also I just picked up the new Dragon
63:37 - Ball game
63:38 - fighter is with the Z that's that's
63:43 - really really fun actually it's it's the
63:45 - best one in a while I think and I really
63:47 - love the way that they've shifted to
63:49 - kind of a locked 2.5 T perspective much
63:54 - in the same way that the old fighting
63:56 - games like Street Fighter work because I
63:58 - thought before the 3d element didn't
64:01 - really work for me I liked it to be kind
64:03 - of simple and it is now and it's just
64:05 - yeah incredibly fun and competitive so
64:07 - check that out which one is better pixel
64:10 - art or low poly 3d completely depends on
64:13 - the game that's the pretty much all
64:16 - there is to say
64:18 - are there going to be any more blender
64:20 - tutorials if you guys want them is there
64:25 - something similar to C++ custom header
64:27 - files in unity c-sharp
64:35 - No
64:37 - can you make a video about game
64:39 - optimization some best practices that
64:41 - would be really fun and it's something
64:43 - that I've had on my list for a long time
64:48 - it's something yeah yeah I would love to
64:53 - do like top five performance or
64:55 - optimization tips and unity and just
64:58 - delve into some different things that
65:00 - normally can be can be apply or some
65:05 - techniques that can normally be applied
65:07 - to most projects in order to make them
65:09 - run better that would definitely be fun
65:11 - one of the big ones is of course object
65:13 - pooling that I just covered in a
65:14 - separate video
65:15 - but also just kind of naming some of
65:17 - these things yeah I would love to do
65:20 - that why don't you apply for a job at
65:22 - unity because I don't really want to
65:25 - work at unity not that it doesn't seem
65:27 - like a great place to work but because I
65:29 - really want to keep doing this and this
65:30 - is really fun and I like the
65:32 - independence so being able to do this at
65:37 - home with some awesome people like
65:40 - Sophie and Thomas is it's really just
65:42 - the biggest gift so yeah why not use a
65:45 - for loop for the explosions in the
65:46 - bomberman tutorial I don't that's
65:53 - probably some way to do that but I don't
65:56 - really see it being simpler because we
65:59 - have to offset them in different ways
66:02 - yeah yeah I know so those of you guys
66:07 - talking about a discord server there is
66:09 - an unofficial discord created by some
66:12 - guys from the forum that is really
66:13 - awesome and we are talking about kind of
66:15 - promoting it some more so if you guys
66:17 - want to hang out and do some real-time
66:18 - chat with the game development community
66:20 - definitely go there I'm sure that the
66:23 - awesome admins will put a link in the
66:26 - chat right now that would be great just
66:29 - yeah a lot of awesome developers there
66:32 - all right so I think they're going to be
66:34 - wrapping up questions now because my
66:36 - throat is getting sore and I do have
66:38 - more stuff to do on today unfortunately
66:41 - work awaits
66:43 - but yeah so final questions and we'll go
66:46 - and wrap this up so do you have a team
66:49 - development or do you do it solo we are
66:51 - three people I of course do all the
66:54 - recording stuff as you can see but we
66:58 - also have Thomas and which is our main
67:01 - video editor he does most are close to
67:05 - all of our video editing and he's become
67:07 - really really good at it I hope you guys
67:10 - recognize that as well the videos
67:12 - require way more editing now especially
67:15 - the ones that are pre-scripted with
67:16 - b-roll and everything so he pretty much
67:19 - does all that and then we have Sophia
67:21 - which does all the video planning she's
67:23 - also used to do a bunch of editing and
67:25 - has been doing that for very long time
67:28 - now but yes she does all the planning
67:31 - she sets up sponsorship deals stuff like
67:35 - that I don't know if you guys have
67:37 - noticed it but we have been having a few
67:40 - sponsors lately and she's able to fund
67:42 - find really good one once it's always
67:45 - tech related we had some sponsorships
67:48 - with with udemy with unity with
67:52 - Skillshare and yeah more coming so
67:55 - that's really awesome and and yes it
67:58 - just kind of you know makes Thomas and I
68:00 - follow the schedule so everything with
68:05 - you know crumble and and yes um
68:08 - sometimes they also soufiane Thomas also
68:11 - held in in scripting videos so yeah we
68:14 - have three people at at the moment and
68:16 - which is really fun because doing
68:18 - something alone is fun doing it with
68:20 - friends even more fun can you do a
68:24 - website game tutorial maybe at some
68:28 - point can you make a tutorial an RTS
68:31 - game with a simple I I've talked about
68:37 - RTS before it's too complicated I do
68:39 - want to go ahead and create some kind of
68:44 - RTS related videos because some of the
68:46 - things are interesting but creating an
68:47 - entire RTS game is way too complicated
68:49 - for a Totoro series turn-based castle
68:51 - game that sounds really fun have you
68:53 - ever thought of doing a 2d top-down
68:55 - shooter I have done one it was fun it's
68:58 - called waving coming it's on my
69:00 - github so if you want to check it out
69:01 - it's there I hate spamming please tell
69:03 - me how to market games free and paid I
69:09 - actually have no idea my way of
69:11 - marketing my game when I was making
69:13 - games and thought it that I wanted to be
69:15 - a game developer was creating a YouTube
69:17 - channel and doing tutorials so I don't
69:19 - the the tutorial part turned out pretty
69:22 - well the game part not so much so and
69:24 - now I'm here so I wouldn't really know
69:26 - too much about that but it's really
69:28 - about figuring out where is your
69:30 - audience and trying to tap into those to
69:33 - the streams available for that audience
69:36 - so in my case I thought my audience
69:38 - because my game was about making games
69:40 - thought would be game developers and so
69:42 - I thought I would try and tap into unity
69:45 - users and with the turtles so that's
69:48 - kind of how I got rolling so that's my
69:50 - thought process at least why Facebook
69:53 - post Twitter but not Instagram because I
69:55 - just don't use Instagram I don't know
69:57 - how it works I've never used it it's
69:59 - good
70:01 - did you create any games with mechanics
70:03 - like in these sim series not really can
70:06 - you make a meditation tutorial and unity
70:08 - yes that would be fun
70:09 - will you make it to turn on mobile game
70:11 - controls I try not to do too much
70:12 - platform specific stuff but maybe mobile
70:16 - game controls could be fun there are a
70:18 - lot of great also free assets for that
70:23 - can you make an advanced 2d platformer
70:25 - character controller not right now it's
70:28 - not on the roadmap they're a bunch of
70:29 - stuff in the asset store check that out
70:31 - do you plan to do a video about the new
70:33 - co-op job system and entities components
70:35 - they seem to be awesome if I'm able to
70:37 - figure them out if they when they come
70:39 - out yes
70:41 - otherwise I might just leave that to
70:43 - your Kim so yeah okay can you make a
70:47 - tutorial to create portal I have a
70:48 - portal 2 tutorial on the YouTube I'm
70:51 - creating this called portal effect not
70:53 - the entire game but I'm sure you can
70:54 - figure something out based on that
70:55 - slowstar send real-time displacement
70:57 - tutorial that sounds fun a lot of
70:59 - graphic stuff guys I would love to do
71:00 - some more graphic stuff especially with
71:02 - the new shader editor and I think we are
71:05 - going to close it here alright questions
71:09 - are up we are closing it it's a wrap
71:11 - guys
71:12 - no more Christian
71:14 - being answered yes my voice is getting
71:16 - sore it's too much cold ah that's pretty
71:23 - much it
71:23 - that was the live stream guys hope you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to this live stream tutorial in this video we are going to be creating a replica of bomberman inside of unity and it's going to look something like this once we're done so if I go ahead and hit play here we should be able to use our mouse and ignore this error it has something to do with the editor not the game I should be able to use on the mouse here to click and place bombs on different tiles and the bombs will then recognize where it's placed and create an explosion so that it doesn't overlap with the walls that it cannot destroy but it should also go ahead and dynamically destroy the elements that it can destroy so just like in the original Bomberman game and it should be really easy for you to go in and add a character controller here that goes around and places bombs instead of using the mouse because our entire environment is actually set up using the unity town map system so we are basically just modifying that at runtime and as you can see we do have a Collider in here so all of the wall elements and all of the destroyable elements here should have colliders and so right away if you go ahead and place a rigidbody in here in fact we can go ahead and try that but it's just try creating the rigidbody in here at runtime this is probably gonna go wrong but I'm just gonna do it anyway so I'm gonna create a 2d object sprite here and I'm just gonna select some kind of sprite let's just do a bomb whoops everything is not working there we go and we can move up the bomb here which I now called W let's just call it bomb and we place it at the top and we add a Collider to it so we're going to do a circle Collider we should actually be able to see this collide with our environment and this is not tested guys that I hope this will work but we're going to add a 2d rigidbody and there you go as you can see it kind of lands on the floor here and as you can see it kind of falls down and yeah so everything is set to work up with collide work with colliders and if we go ahead and say destroy part of the environment here you can see these colliders get removed okay that example it turned out way better than I thought it would so about that but yeah so let's don't dive right into the tutorial also towards the end we'll do a Q&A so make sure you to watch the video all the way through because we're going to be answering questions at the end like we always do so now we can go file open project because I've actually gone ahead and prepared kind of a starter project the reason why is I wanted to just include all the sprites I'm going to be using to have all the tiles set up appropriately also because I'm using rule tiles and I'm going to show you what this is in a second and I'm going to refer you to a video as well as a place where you can download this started project so don't worry you can learn all about it there's no black magic in this it's just for convenience I've gone ahead and created this project as you can see I already have mine sitting on my computer here but if you want to download it yourself I do have a link for that and for the people watching on YouTube there will of course be a link in the description and to the people watching on twitch I have a link that you can check out in the chat right there and I would ask the admins to go ahead and copy it and have it ready if people ask at a later point because I'm not going to be able to focus on pasting that in different places but yeah there is a link to the started project and this is what the started project looks like as you can see we just have a completely empty scene there's nothing in here other than a main camera but I also have a tile palette set up called Bomberman and if this window isn't open for you you can always go window and select tile palette and that should open it up and in here I've configured a few different tasks and you can see those under the tiles folder right here we have the wall tile that's that one right here just a static tile with a sink single sprite we have the destructible that's that one right here the same thing just a simple tile with a single sprite and then we have the dirt and wall filler and these are more complicated as you can see because these are what we call rule tars this allows these allow us to set up rules for how our tiles should look depending on how we paint with them depending on what tasks are nearby and this allows us to really easily paint goodlooking environments where the tiles correspond to each other I've talked about how to set up tiles and how you can get rule tiles because it's not um included with unity by default and all that stuff and how to use tile Maps in general in a video I just created called tile Maps and unity so if you want to learn more about how to paint with tile maps and set all that stuff up I would definitely recommend you check out that video of course also have a link to that in the description so with that we can actually go out and create a tile map now so in order to create a tile map we go to the hierarchy we rightclick we go to the object and we select tile map and this creates a grid where we can configure the size of the grid as well as a tile map object and as I've explained in the video I did a tile map is basically like a layer in Photoshop so we can go ahead and paint stuff onto a tile map and we can create multiple tile maps and layer them on top of each other if we want to have depth sort of say in our tabs so this tile map we can actually go ahead and paint on two right away we do that by selecting the brush tool here and hitting B we want to select the appropriate palettes here I only have one called the Bomberman which is included in the project and I'm gonna go ahead and select say the dirt here to the left now as you can see this is a rule tile and this means that if I go ahead and paint with it you can see that it automatically chooses a sprite that is appropriate for the position or for the on tile depending on the nearby tiles so that's pretty cool instead of us having to go in and select a corner like this I'd select a filler and all that stuff that you would normally do in order to create kind of corresponding tasks so we'll go ahead and use this to sketch out our level and I'm gonna make this fairly wide here something along these lines and I'm actually just going to make it completely square is this completely square this is not completely square this is completely square I believe there we go I'm going to hit G in order to fill out the entire thing there we go and and click with my mouse and then switch back to be in order to change back to brush mode I'm just going to make sure that the size of this is correct so if we imagine that we have walls all the way round here and we then go ahead and place one two three four wall pieces and then we have another wall so this is the correct size of the level that I want to make then we can select the wall filler this one here and I'm just gonna fill out with this all the way round here I'm actually going to do ain't no other patch add that just so that it isn't completely empty around our level so if we go ahead and look in the game view whoa for some reason our main camera is a bit zoomed in here and it isn't really positioned in a way that I'd like so I'm just going to take the main camera I'm going to move it over here by 0.5 on the X in order to be exact I'm also just going to change the size of the camera here in order to kind of zoom it out and we can also move it down by 0.5 or negative point 5 on the Y here just to Center it on our level and that actually looks pretty decent I'm actually going to zoom it in a bit more something around there um we can definitely go in here and add more wall filler in order to make sure that no matter what screen size we use that we are going to fill everything out with sprites so that it doesn't look weird angle Ichi there we go so now we should see that our level looks just fine and this is kind of the background of a level this is kind of what we want everything else to be painting painted on top of so we can go ahead and select our tile map and rename it to tile map underscore and I'm gonna call this background and because this is a background we are going to set the ordering layer for our talib render 21 so now it's going to be drawn underneath everything else now we can right click on a grid sirico 2d object and select tile map again and we've now created another layer and this one is going to be time app underscore gameplay this is where all avoid gameplay tiles the ones that actually affect our players are going to be and this is of course the destructible environment and the walls so let's start by painting some walls here I'm still I still have the brush selected but do note that you don't need to select the time app in the hierarchy instead you need to go under active tile map and choose the one that you want to paint to so I'm gonna change this to tile map game play select the wall and now I should be able to paint with the wall so I'm gonna go ahead and paint some walls whoops and if you missed and miss click or something you can always hold down shift in order to remove there we go and I'm gonna place in all of the walls inside of our level square here and there we go this now looks like a completely typical Bomberman level cool so now we've actually kind of created the whole base for our game this is how incredibly simple it can be to create levels using this tile map system the next thing that we want to do is make sure that all of our levels are sort or all of the elements in our level are sort of interactable in other words we want to add colliders to each of these wall pieces so that if we go ahead and create say a player character he will be able to collide with them so let's go ahead and hit add component and in here we're going to create a tile map Collider 2d and as you can see this goes ahead and actually creates you can see it out or outlines each one of these elements with a green line and this is of course a Collider you can also see it creates lines between each one of these elements and that's because it's creating a box Collider for each element which is not very performant so instead what we want to do is actually go in here and add another component that will automatically combine all these colliders in an effective way and this is what we call a I've actually forgot forgotten what it's called here let's go into physics 2d and it select the scene here composite Collider yes so the composite Collider 2d and this automatically creates a rigidbody and this doesn't mean that we need our tile map in to move in any way we can simply set the body type to static and now it really is as F or is as if the rigid body wasn't there it's not going to apply any forces or anything it knows this object is not going to move and then we can go to the Tom F Collider and we can hit used by composite and right away you can see all the green lines between the different parts disappear and we now have one uniform line going all the way around for the wall tiles that are next to each other and this is actually happening at runtime so if at runtime we were to change our tile map our composite Collider will change the way that it generates really cool and this also means that we can go ahead and now paint more elements so if we want to paint with the destructive tile here we can actually just go in here and as you can see right away the collider update so I'm just gonna paint a bunch of destructible elements in here so that we can see it working later and it will look really cool and I'm just gonna scatter these throughout this is not really about creating an interesting level as much as it is a demo but there we go we now have some elements in here and as you can see the collider again has updated for all of these one thing that you do need to know about when creating our Collider is for your tile map is that you need to set up what sort of Collider you want each town to have so if we go to our say wall here we can actually change the collider type of our wall and as you can see I've set mine to grid if you select none no colliders are going to be generated for this element and as you can see if I select it now all of the wall elements are ignored by our Collider this is definitely not what we want if you select sprite it's going to generate a Collider based on the sprite so for example for this destroyed wall part here or this destructible part it's actually going to generate a Collider that goes around all the details of the sprite we don't want that we simply want a square Collider and so we choose grid this simply creates a Collider that is completely Square and it's the same size as the grid element and this is what I want for both the wall and the destructible and then for the dirt and the wall filler not that we have are applying any colliders on these elements because they are on the background but I do definitely want to go ahead and simply set those to none I don't want any collision on these elements whatsoever so that's how you can configure it for individual tiles so now that we have set up our environment in the way that we want it's time to start actually doing things through script and the first thing that we want to do is being able to spawn in bombs so let's actually create a bomb to do that we'll go under the sprites here and let's take the bomb that is included in the project and let's drag it right into our scene ash oops something weird happened there created a material game a bit kind of disappeared did it make a tile out of it that was weird I have no idea what just happened do any of you guys it seems that the tile map renderer for some reason took on the material created for the bomb here okay so we are probably just gonna go ahead answer the experts default for that one and everything is back to normal that was very weird I have no idea what happened but instead of dragging it in here we can probably just drag it into the heart yes okay so now I created our bomb and we can see it in our game we also want to make sure that our bomb is always overlaid on top of our gameplay layers so let's go ahead and set the order in layer two one here then we can actually move our element here whoops I'm going to switch into 2d mode here and just that's place it at the center of our scene here this is kind of how it's going to look like or go to look it's this is kind of how it's going to look like when we create a bomb and the main thing that we want to happen for this bomb is that after a little while we of course want it to explode so we're going to have some kind of explosion component on our bomb but let's create that later for now let's just take this bomb and turn it into a prefab so let's create a folder inside of our project for prefabs and let's drag it right in there there we go so now we can remove it from our scene and we can go ahead and create a bomb spawner so let's rightclick in our hierarchy create an empty object and this is where we'll put a bomb spawner let's reset the transform and call it bomb spawner and then we can add component and we're going to create a bomb spawner script of type C sharp and let's say create an ADD and now we can double click this to open it up in Visual Studio and while it's waiting or booting up here I'm just gonna have a look at the chat to see if everything is working looks like it that's awesome and yeah let's just go ahead and continue with the video that so the first thing that we want is because we are going to be working with Tom Maps we're going to be using unity engine dot tar maps you always always want to do this when you want to use tar or work with tar maps in scripting in unity we can however delete the two top namespaces there we're not going to be using those we can also remove the start function we won't be using that either but what we want is a reference to our tile map game play layer the reason why is that we go ahead and create a bomb let's say that we go ahead and unit is lagging out here so let's say that we go ahead and click and want to place a bomb right in the middle here on this tab we don't want the bomb to actually appear right where our mouse clicked that way if we click that in the corner here it would actually overlay some of the other tiles no we want we want it to snap to the center of the town that we clicked on so even though we click in the corner of the tile it should snap right to the center to do this we of course need a reference to a tile map in order to determine where the center of the given tile is so let's create a public tile map and this is going to be our tile map we can just call it bad we're also going to want a public game object which is going to be of course a reference to our bomb prefab what we want to actually spawn then inside of our update mode let's check if we get a mouse button down so if we get a mouse button press to do that we use input dot get mouse button down and the mouse button that we want to check for is just the left mouse button which is index of zero so if we press our left mouse button well um actually I just need to rearrange something on my other screen here one second okay cool so um if we press our mouse button we want to go ahead and first of all get the position that we pressed so we can use camera dot Maine dot screen to world point in order to convert input dot mouse position into world coordinates so input that Mouse position gives us the position of our mouse in screen coordinates which is the amount of pixels on the X and the y from the I think it's upper right upper left corner but it could be lower left corner but I'm pretty sure its upper left corner and we convert that into a well position by using this function then we can store this position as a vector three so we'll create a vector three call it world position and set it equal to that then we want to go ahead and take this world position and couldn't into a cell in other words what tile and we referred to a tile on a grid as a cell so what cell did we press well to do that we used another handy function called tile map dot world to sell this takes just in our ordinary world position and converts it to a cell position and a cell position is actually also stored oops my phone going off now a cell physician is actually also stored as a vector3 but not a normal vector three so we can go ahead and write back the three here and call it sale and set it equal to our map dot world to sell but the cell here is can actually okay can be stored in a vector three but what we normally use here is a vector three int and the reason why is that cells or cell numbers are always referred to in whole numbers in integers we cannot have a half cell so this using this data type here is simply faster it's simply easier to store because we don't need to store decimal places for each of the three numbers they all integers that's the only difference here and finally we need to get the center position of the cell so now we've determined on our grid here on our grid that we have which cell on this grid did we press and now we need to find say we press the center here now we need to find the center position of this cell and to do that we simply need to go tile map dot get cell center world and here we input again a position of the cell so this cell here and this is going to again be a vector3 and for this we of course want to have decimal places so it's going to be a normal vector three and we'll call this the cell center position all right so now we've chewed through kind of all the calculations that we need to do first converting from our screen space which is where our mouse position is to a world position that's what we do here then converting from a well position to a cell defining the right cell then converting from the cell to the center well position of that cell and finally we can go ahead and instantiate our bond so we can instantiate a bond prefab add these cells Center position with no rotation so catonian dot identity and if we now say this and go into unity and hit play we should see that we have no errors fingers crossed okay so I clicked play twice so it actually unplayed but now if I click OK I know that we're gonna get an error now because we didn't actually refer it to the bomb prefab so there we go but it is working I promise you so we can go back into a bond spawner we need to reference first of all our tile map which is going to be Tama up gameplay and then under prefabs we're going to reference or bomb prefab there we go and if we now it play I am try and place a bomb yes so you can see no matter where I press on some of these tiles a bomb is actually going to be pressed of course it doesn't explode yet but that is kind of an introduction to working with some of these positions when it comes to toss how do you place game objects on tiles how do you kind of refactor some of these positional data so yeah that I think that was a pretty important thing to learn when working with on tile Maps you will also note that we can place bombs on pretty much all tiles in our entire tile map so we're not really doing any checking to see if the place is bomb compatible and you could definitely do that but I don't think it's important here because the only thing that's going to be placing bombs is your character and he's never going to be able to move to these locations so yeah you might do that if you want to go all in but I don't think it's necessarily something you need to do cool so now that we are placing bombs in the right positions it's time to go ahead and make these bombs explode and of course in order to make them explode we need to have some kind of a countdown timer but right before we create that I'm just going have a look in the chat here and see if I'm still streaming or if I'm just talking to myself okay so things things are going good awesome the next thing that we will do is create a bomb script so we'll go to our prefabs bomb and we'll create another component here and this is going to be the bomb script oops bomb and will it create an ad and we'll double click it to open it up in Visual Studio and this is definitely going to be this simplest script that we'll be riding today the only thing that we want to do is replace the start method with some kind of public float which we'll call our countdown and will default this to say two seconds then inside our update method so every frame we want to go ahead and reduce our countdown by time.deltatime in other words each second we're going to reduce a countdown variable by one and so this is going to count down for two seconds and we can go ahead and check if countdown gues reaches zero or goes below zero well then we actually want to go ahead and explode but before we do that we actually need some way of having the bomb explode so right now let's just write a debugger lock saying boom as well as a destroy call oops I did not improve the correct symbol there as well as a destroy hold that is going to remove this game object so right after we say boom in the console we're going to destroy the bomb game object and it's going to be no more cool so let's say that and let's make sure that it's applied to a prefab and everything and that we get no errors yes and then we can hit play and now we should be able to see that if I click wait two seconds it says boom and the bomb is gone perfect so now we have the kind of timing of the bombs are perfected and the only thing left really now is creating the actual map destroy a script and I'm just gonna go ahead and place this on the grid but you can really place it anywhere that you'd like let's call it map destroyer destroy your and let's say create an ad and it's doubleclick it to open it up and this is going to be a bit longer this script but it's not necessarily going to be more complicated than what we've already done so the first thing that we want to do is get rid of both of functions we're not going to be using any of the default unity functions we'll also go ahead and use unity engine you guessed it dart tar maps and finally we're going to get a reference a public tile map to a tunnel and we can just go ahead and call that town map as well because we are going to be modifying our gameplay tile map so we need a reference to our gameplay tile map and now we need a couple of functions let's create a public void which we'll call explode and this is going to take in a vector two with the position where we want to explode and this is going to be a position in world coordinates so we could also just call this world pause just to be a tiny more tiny bit more specific that's probably a good idea and the first thing that we want to go and do is convert this world position that gets inputted into this function into a cell the cell of the origin of the explosion so we'll create so we'll use tile map dot world to sell in order to find the right cell will input the world position that was passed in and we'll go ahead and store this as again a vector3 int called the origin cell which just looks or sounds so incredibly cold origins cell it sounds like something taken right out of the matrix we've achieved the origin cell and we're ready to proceed all right okay that's probably the most nerdiest thing I've said today but it will continue so with this origin cell we need to go ahead and of course explode the cell that the bomb is on but we also want to explode the I'm gonna go ahead and show you this we of course going to explode the cell that the bomb gets placed on but we also want to explode the two cells above this bomb the two cells to the right of this bomb two to the two down and two to the left so let's create a function for exploding a particular cell and then simply call that function with a tiny bit of offset from the origin cell so one one offset on the X to offset on the x one offset on the y to offset on the Y and so on so let's go ahead and create a public another function in here this doesn't need to be public we can just call it make it of a void private void call it explode cell and this is of course going to take in the cell that we want to explore it so a vector3 int called sale and here we go ahead and explode your appropriate cell and the way that we want to do this is first to convert this position or this cell number into an actual top so we need to figure out the data of the cell that this that we're trying to explode so to 'try to achieve the town with a certain cell index what we do is use tom ab get tau and here we feed it simply the cell so simply the position of the top we also need to make sure to convert this because by default this is going to give us what is called a table base so this is going to give us a tall base and a table base is basically just the class that all tile types derive from so by default right now unity just comes with a single tile that derived from tower base and that's just called tau it's the basic table it has the stride a collider that's pretty much it and you can place it in your tile map but I think with time unity is going to be adding multiple kinds of tasks such as ruler tiles which I've included in this project here and you can get from from a github repository that unity has made animated tasks terrain tiles all that kind of stuff as well as you can also create your own tiles that derive from tile base so that's all good but Todd base doesn't actually give us a lot of information about the tile in fact the only thing that it gives us is kind of just a name and the ability to get some more data but that's all very complicated instead what we want to do is actually retrieve the top so we want to be more specific and say hey we just we don't just want to get any tile deriving from tile base we want to only get a top as in the tile that we've gone ahead and created here the destructible and wall this is not gonna work for rule tile because rule tiles are also derived from tile base but their rule tiles not just tasks I know this is very confusing but we want to get the destructible and wall tiles and so we want to be specific that we want to get a tower and so we can actually specify that right here we want to get a tile of the type tile and if you wanted to get a rule tile you can get a ton of the tithe rule tile so this is where you specify what you want to get so we want to get a towel and we'll call it tile and it's going to be of type tile tile tile tile so now that we've gotten the towel at the right position what we want to do is do some checking on this we want to check is this a wall tile in which case we want to stop the explosion right there is this a destructible tile in which case we want to go ahead and well destroy it and we can even check if the towel simply doesn't exist so in order to do that what we want to do is simply go up here and create a few references we want to create a reference to the destructible tile as well as the wall tile so that we can compare the tile that we want to explode to those two and check if they're the same so here we can create a public towel and we'll call this all tile as well as a public tile that will call destructible tile and then down here we can simply check if the town that we're looking at so if tile is equal to wall tile well then we don't want to do anything because we cannot destroy walls so we simply going to return out of the function we also check if the tile is equal to a destructible tile in which case we are going to go ahead and actually change the tile to remove or in actually we're not just going to change it we're going to remove the top I'm going to show you how to do that in a second then finally if it's not a wall tile but if it's a destructible tile or there is no tile well then we want to go ahead and create an explosion on the top and then we can simply empty function so this is how we would kind of construct it this is how we can get a towel and find out what tile we're working with and in the case that we want to destroy the tile what we do is using tile map dot set tile and this is pretty much the equivalent of the function up here here we get a towel at the certain position here we set a towel at a certain position at first we give it the position so cell and then we give it the new tile that we wanted to be so here we could set it to a wall tile if we wanted to we could set it to a destructible tile any other tile if you reference it or we could simply set it to null in order to remove it and that's what we want to do here so if we say this we should actually be able to call this function and let's actually just try and do that so for now we can maybe just call it on the origin cell so up here we can say explode cell and we just want to explode our origin cell if we now save this and and we select our grid and under our map destroyer we should get to three fields here the first one is we need to reference our town map gameplay the second is we want a reference to a wall tile as well as the destructible tile and if we now play we should see that if I place a palm here right on top of some dirt it should remove that dirt don't know why it didn't remove that dirt oh because we also need to of course call this function I'm being stupid so we actually also need to go into our bomb and instead of just debug dead logging boom we need to call this explode function and for now we can just use find object of type map destroyer in order to get a reference to this script and then simply use dot explode and then we'll give it our current position so transform dot position of course I would recommend you to use a singleton here instead I've shown you how to create very simple singleton patterns before if you want to know more about what Singleton's are I love also have a link for that in the description if you're watching on YouTube but it's basically just a more efficient way of getting a reference to a script that is only that only exists once inside the scene and it's a very complicated sentence but basically it just is more performant than this line of code right here so I would recommend you add that but this is not what the video is about so we're just going to do it this way and find the object each time so now we called explode on the map destroyer every time our bomb is ready to explode if we save that and hit play we should now be able to do this thing that I was trying to do before which is place a bomb on top of some destructible piece of environment and it should remove it if we pray place it on some dirt nothing happens and if we place it on a wall nothing happens so it only destroys destructible tiles that's because inside of our function in the map Destroyer it checks if the tile is distractible town and if it is it removes it so it says something about this working let's also go ahead and create an explosion each time just to make this more visible and it I think it's going to help us when we try and explode more cells so to create an explosion we really just need a reference to a prefab that we can spawn in and we can go ahead and create that here so we'll create a public game object and we'll call it explosion prefab and then down here when we want to create the explosion we first want to change the cell here to a world position so we can use Tom app dot cell to world and we'll give it our cell here and then we can we actually also need to offset this a little bit and before we use this let me find it here this gets tells Center world and I think we need to use that also here actually instead so let's use dot get cell Center world yes yes this is what we need to use and here we simply input this cell cool that's the right function because this will get the center of the cell and this is where we want to instantiate our explosion so this is going to be a victor three that will called position what's that equal to the result there and then we can instantiate an explosion prefab add the position with no rotation so quaternion identity let's save that go into unity select our grid wait for it to refresh here there we go now we can drag in a prefab but of course we need to create this explosion prefab and I've gone ahead and imported some sprites for the explosion here as well by the way all these sprites here the dirt explosion and mold are also included in some of the unity example scene so they are created by unity so in here we can go to the sprite editor and as you can see it's automatically laid out all the individuals rights for this explosion so whoops and if we close this right editor we can see each of them here and in order to make an animation out of these we simply need to select all them by holding down shift and drag them into our hierarchy and this is going to prompt us to create an animation let's create a new folder for this which we'll call animation and let's call it the explosion animation let's save and now it creates this explosion on this course zero object we're simply going to rename this to explosion there we go and if we go into the animation window we can go window and image animation there we go we can now scrub through and see the animation asset place and we can just hit play here if you want to preview it in real time so now we have an animation I just want to make sure that at the end here we add a final key frame that gets rid of the smoke so that when it plays all the way through it disappears so I'm just gonna hit record here go place it right at the end of our animation and go ahead and set the sprite to none and so now it should insert so that if we play through the animation and it ends here there we go it's gone and finally we can go under the animation here and select the clip explosion on our arm there we go explosion and we want to disable loop time so now our animation won't loop it will just play once and then it won't be visible anymore so now we have our explosion and we can actually go out and make a prefab out of this as well and we can remove it from our scene and now if we go under our grid and drag in our explosion prefab that we just created hit play and place it place a bomb somewhere in our scene we should see there we go we now have an explosion effect and of course it's currently only right on top of the bomb but we can simply go ahead and call the same explode so function just like we do and then simply offset it to the up to the right to the left and down in order to create more explosions of the same kind and we can do this really easily but first I just want to have a look at the chat here to see how everyone is doing looks good I hope I hope you guys are able to to follow along I know this down video is kind of all over the place right now but the Talmud system is all new and interesting and I thought I would cover it as much as possible really don't mind it if if you aren't able to follow along with with everything you'll learn with time this is really just an introduction but yeah it looks like everything is good in the chat so we can go ahead and continue and so I wanted to go ahead and call the explode cell here and then simply offset it to go up and to the right and down and to the left and to do this we can simply copy this experts a call and then simply add a tiny offset on to our origin cell position so we'll do plus new vector3 int and here we can then offset it on the x y&z so and of course first we want to go ahead and offset it by 1 on the X 0 on the Y and 0 on the Z and we can go ahead and copy this a bunch of times so then we want to go to on the X then we want to go 0 on the X and 1 on the y then we want to go 0 on the X and 2 on the Y and you're kind of getting the system here however we don't want to offset it on the Z because we're not really working with depth in that way instead what we want to do is offset it by negative 1 and negative 2 on the X and then do the same thing on the Y here so negative 1 on the Y and negative 2 on the Y in other words plus 1 plus 1 on the Y plus 1 plus 2 on the X negative 1 negative 2 on the Y negative 2 1 negative 2 on the X so that's how we are getting this pattern and we should now see actually that if we just say this and go in and play and place a bomb it should work right off the bat so if we place a bomb here now we get this lovely explosion effect it removes the part of the environment that we want whoops I shouldn't place it on top of that but you can see it working the only problem with this is that if we place it somewhere where it should actually be blocked by a wall say here you can see that the explosion doesn't actually trigger on the wall but it goes through to the other side and this is of course not something we want you want walls to be able to accept like an explosion so how do we do that well we can actually do it fairly simply we can do it by using a return type to this function in other words instead of returning nothing we'll go ahead and return a ball and this pool is going to indicate it's going to indicate whether or not on the explosion was blocked by a wall so in the case that we hit a wall tile we're going to return false because the explosion didn't happen here and so we don't want it to continue in the case that we didn't in other words we reach this point in the code we're going to return true because the explosion did happen and we didn't hit a wall and so we want the explosion to continue so this pool here is just do we want to continue our explosion in the given direction and we can then use that up here so this actually gives a ball now we can use collect it in or we can store it as a pool variable called should continue and set it equal like that and then we can use an if statement but we don't actually need to store each one of them in a variable instead we can simply do a if statement and then wrap the explosion in that and I know it looks kind of confusing but this actually does the same thing so right here we are calling the load cell and we're saying that if it returns true well then we want to go ahead and explode the next cell in the same direction and we want to go ahead and do that for each given direction so if explode cell on the Y here it's true well then we want to explode this second cell on the Y and we just go through and do this for each one of them so if whoops don't want to manually write this when you can do that if explode cell on negative x here we'll want to explode the second one and if explode cell on the first negative Y well then we want to explode this second cell on the negative Y there we go and that should actually do all of the appropriate checking for us of course you could use Ray casts and colliders and complicate yourself in all kinds of ways but this does the exact same thing and sometimes this is what you have to do if you're used to working with unity and kind of thinking about these problems in an abstract threedimensional ways such as we need to determine if something is blocking this explosion we send out a ray to determine this much of this stuff can be avoided if you just take a step back and look at the problem and say well everything is on a grid and that just simply simplifies so many things so here we got away by using not using ray casts and simply writing out of some of this code and it's actually very effective because we're only returning a boolean here so it shouldn't really cost too much performancewise yeah as you can see I'm pretty satisfied with this piece of course so let's go ahead and hit play and now we should see that if we place it say here it should get blocked here and indeed it does if we place it between two walls the explosion doesn't go through and that's actually the end of what I wanted to show you we can now place bombs all over the place and they should interact appropriately you can also see that the bomb right now doesn't trigger if an explosion hits it you can have some bombs trigger other bombs it's that if that something you want we can also just change the order so it doesn't look bad as it does right now so in here the palm county has an ordering layer of one let's go ahead and set the explosions over in the year two three so now the explosion overlays all of the objects and we should see that if we placed two bombs next to each other it looks a bit better when they explode so yeah that's just a tiny fix really from here it's up to you to go ahead and add some kind of character controller and you can you make him rigidbody enabled because everything is set up to work with colliders it's about adding powerups we have a video on YouTube that we did recently on creating powerups for games so if that's something you want to add to your game definitely check out that video and if you have any more questions about tile maps I also did a video specifically on creating and modifying tar maps unity and creating your own custom tiles importing tile sets so if you want to use your own sprites and not my example project here definitely check out that video as well so I think that's pretty much all the video shoutouts that I could think of right now and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video I think it was a pretty exciting little project to make and it's something that I've been wanting to do ever since I heard unity was working on a tile map system I thought Bomberman this will be the bomb no pun intended so um cool yeah that's pretty much the end of the road for the tutorial I think we are ready to go to the Q&A so hello everyone in chat I am all ready to do more talking luckily I've got some water with me and at this point you are or completely free la can't talk anymore feel free at this point to ask questions I will do my best to answer them anything at all try and avoid duplicate questions twine about try and avoid ants spamming them in fact don't spam at all but yeah just ask away I'm here cool so I'm gonna take it to the water and all of you guys have some questions for me they can be technical nontechnical personal why are you using Victor 3 and instead of Victor int that's a good question the reason why is that inside of the art or using the time app API things actually come back with the C position as well and I think this has to do with ordering for different tasks on the same layer I think you are able to do something along those lines I'm not completely sure but for some reason it does return a vector3 and with the Z position in our example everything is at zero so I'm sure that you could use vector to end and it would automatically convert it to that just didn't see a reason how should I start at learning low poly modeling in blender well actually do have a tutorial series on creating a low poly model that is came ready in blender so you can check that out but really it's just about start starting to create some of these things just downloading blender open it up being complete idiot and don't know where anything is and just take it from there it's about practice really but there are some really good blender tutorials online not only this series that I did hey Braga's do have some good links about the API of unity networking sorry not off the top of my head know what is your call and using interfaces in a unity game I use them for some of my games I think interfaces for me is for I should wear this differently I normally only use interfaces very rarely and the reason why is that when I make a game most of the time it's smaller projects and it's game jam projects or tutorial projects and in those it's not often that I need the functionality of interfaces because most of what interfaces are used for our writing solid code especially if you have a large code base or if you're working multiple people on a project often doesn't make sense if you're trying to do something as quickly as possible and so I don't often use them but they can be really really useful they can also be a trap so they're great if you know what you're doing would you like to create a video tutorial on photon multiplayer maybe at some point I heard photon is great are you going to make a chess game in the next live stream because I think it's an easy thing to make chess could be fun I've never thought of it as easy but I guess with this time app system it wouldn't be that hard that's actually a very good idea I will write it down no promises but I'll write it out do you make an Android tutorial I try not to make platformspecific tutorials too much do publish games I don't publish finished games no I do create smaller projects for tutorials and game jams if you want to check out my games you can go to the aloo Matar a website or just search for brekkie student diary and they should appear how about footprint tutorial that could definitely be exciting creating some kind of custom shader for that could be fun they're going to make some Android tutor again same thing as before can you make a bazooka to talk Wow bazookas could be cool I really want to do that I don't think I think it's a bit too close to something I've done before I've created a tutorial on creating grenades in unity that actually destroys part of the environment so I think you could check that out and then simply instead of having a grenade model just have a missile model that just threw a shoot through the level with some particles and something I've pretty much the same thing do you have any idea to do tutorials on an openworld game no that is simply too complex and requires way too much asset creation will you do some tutorials and databases if I was better at databases I probably would however I mean anything can they depends on if you mean local and network databases anything networked is something I suck at local database is there a bunch of stuff that you can do there with JSON and XML or scriptable objects I will have a tutorial on scriptable objects that I suggest to check out if you want to create a local database or just easy way of storing or creating data objects in unity you can check out my scribble objects video but networks probably not right now can you do some advanced 2d tutorials I don't know about you guys but I thought this was fairly advanced I know that there's a lot more that you can do with the Tal map system but it's probably just because I've never used it before but I was researching this and I was confused at some points mostly with the relationship between tiles and and how you're supposed to go about everything but yeah but I would love to do some more advanced stuff at some point do you have any idea to make basic copy protection for unity games nope sorry why gravity not working with animated component if you're over I don't know this this completely depends on the setup of your project but if you are overriding positions of a game object then physics aren't going to work you can physics enable your animation so that physics get applied on top of your animations you shouldn't be modifying the brute position of your object anyways through animation that is my answer can you do a 2d tutorial in the style of Castle Crashers don't starve slash don't starve where there is some depth not completely sure what you mean but those games are awesome and I could maybe do something along those lines yeah what is the best way to make in this run and spawned objects pose yes object pools are basically made for endless runners they are the best example of where you could use object pools so definitely check out my new video on object pooling yay and if you want to learn about some of the other stuff on creating it this runner check out the how to making video game series which shows that can you test our games we actually talking about doing a livestream earlier today after Ludum dare a where I play your games an entire livestream reserved for Christians and answers and just having fun and playing some of the games that you guys create that is something that I really want to do so I'll try to make Ori to set that up only if you guys want to see it if you let me know actually right now is that something you would like to see where we just take some time an hour or so where we sit down and chill and you guys send me some of the games that you make and I can maybe give some feedback and try them out and suck at them live and embarrass myself go cry in the corner now that I think about it it sounds great do you want to create a shaded tutorial series yes especially with the new shader graph I've never been a technical artist per se and so my shader writing knowledge is limited and you know some stuff but not all of it definitely and I would love to cover the new shader graph because they're going to I think it's going to be pretty much the standard standard of how people are going to make be making shaders in unity soon yeah I don't see a lot of people scripting their own shaders with this new tall vegetation and realistic environment on unity and that's something that could be really interested doing something some of this photogrammetry stuff in unity showing off stuff like mega scans or doing a video one on PBR and and some of those rendering techniques but a lot of this stuff is happening to unity right now especially with the scriptable render pipeline so I wouldn't want to go too much into detail before we know kind of how it's RP is going to turn out and how the new graphics workflow and unity is going to be things are still kind of unknown because things are in early beta and so um do you have any recommendations for someone someone wanting to study in Denmark coming from Portugal recommendations yeah I think what I would probably do is is try and go to people in order to make friends because we Danes we tend to kind of not be too good at being the ones that has the incentive to you know actually go and talk to people we tend to kind of shield ourselves and only talk to the ones that we know I know when you talk to ourselves if we are weird like I am and then but but really most people if you just come and talk to them they enjoy it we do enjoy it we just don't do it I don't know why so that would probably be the main thing is just go and talk to people that way you're going to have friends because otherwise yeah and go to social events try and find some mom some circles of people that you think could be likeminded I think that's probably the main thing moving to another country is try and build a network what do you recommend for learning more about shaders right now there are of course a bunch of good resources for shader writing I would mostly recommend stuff like cat like so cat like coding Ellen's Taccone and making stuff look good on YouTube there was some I three can you make us a turtle for survival games I already have a huge series on creating a survival game in unity guys come on it's like 35 videos long or something but and I'm not gonna touch it anymore I'm sorry it's it's too old it's outdated and I think it's more exciting to do different kind of projects you can go watch that to get some inspiration at least I'm sorry that it's old and in JavaScript but yeah but really a survival game is in much way in many ways the same as kind of it kind of a mix between a firstperson shooter and an RPG so you can check out my multiplayer first tutorial and my RPG tutorial and try and combine the two in a way that sex that would probably be my recommendation what games to play yourself I play a lot of games I don't have time to play them but I try and play a lot of games this is what I should say so right now or for a long time now my big passion has been csgo Counter Strike global Offensive it's just so fun and I often I'm kind of a social game and most of the time when I play it with friends and it's such a fun competitive game so we play that a lot historically I've played a huge amount of World of Warcraft what if I was able to take all the hours that I put into World of Warcraft and put them into a actually useful skill I would be the world's best guitarist but yeah those are two that I've spent a lot of time on but I also try and play smaller games I just replayed a super meatboy which was really fun I haven't played that for a very long time and recently I played all the way through Ori and the blind forest which is such a good game I couldn't recommend it enough and I'm looking so much forward to full of the wisps on this the second one and also I just picked up the new Dragon Ball game fighter is with the Z that's that's really really fun actually it's it's the best one in a while I think and I really love the way that they've shifted to kind of a locked 2.5 T perspective much in the same way that the old fighting games like Street Fighter work because I thought before the 3d element didn't really work for me I liked it to be kind of simple and it is now and it's just yeah incredibly fun and competitive so check that out which one is better pixel art or low poly 3d completely depends on the game that's the pretty much all there is to say are there going to be any more blender tutorials if you guys want them is there something similar to C++ custom header files in unity csharp No can you make a video about game optimization some best practices that would be really fun and it's something that I've had on my list for a long time it's something yeah yeah I would love to do like top five performance or optimization tips and unity and just delve into some different things that normally can be can be apply or some techniques that can normally be applied to most projects in order to make them run better that would definitely be fun one of the big ones is of course object pooling that I just covered in a separate video but also just kind of naming some of these things yeah I would love to do that why don't you apply for a job at unity because I don't really want to work at unity not that it doesn't seem like a great place to work but because I really want to keep doing this and this is really fun and I like the independence so being able to do this at home with some awesome people like Sophie and Thomas is it's really just the biggest gift so yeah why not use a for loop for the explosions in the bomberman tutorial I don't that's probably some way to do that but I don't really see it being simpler because we have to offset them in different ways yeah yeah I know so those of you guys talking about a discord server there is an unofficial discord created by some guys from the forum that is really awesome and we are talking about kind of promoting it some more so if you guys want to hang out and do some realtime chat with the game development community definitely go there I'm sure that the awesome admins will put a link in the chat right now that would be great just yeah a lot of awesome developers there all right so I think they're going to be wrapping up questions now because my throat is getting sore and I do have more stuff to do on today unfortunately work awaits but yeah so final questions and we'll go and wrap this up so do you have a team development or do you do it solo we are three people I of course do all the recording stuff as you can see but we also have Thomas and which is our main video editor he does most are close to all of our video editing and he's become really really good at it I hope you guys recognize that as well the videos require way more editing now especially the ones that are prescripted with broll and everything so he pretty much does all that and then we have Sophia which does all the video planning she's also used to do a bunch of editing and has been doing that for very long time now but yes she does all the planning she sets up sponsorship deals stuff like that I don't know if you guys have noticed it but we have been having a few sponsors lately and she's able to fund find really good one once it's always tech related we had some sponsorships with with udemy with unity with Skillshare and yeah more coming so that's really awesome and and yes it just kind of you know makes Thomas and I follow the schedule so everything with you know crumble and and yes um sometimes they also soufiane Thomas also held in in scripting videos so yeah we have three people at at the moment and which is really fun because doing something alone is fun doing it with friends even more fun can you do a website game tutorial maybe at some point can you make a tutorial an RTS game with a simple I I've talked about RTS before it's too complicated I do want to go ahead and create some kind of RTS related videos because some of the things are interesting but creating an entire RTS game is way too complicated for a Totoro series turnbased castle game that sounds really fun have you ever thought of doing a 2d topdown shooter I have done one it was fun it's called waving coming it's on my github so if you want to check it out it's there I hate spamming please tell me how to market games free and paid I actually have no idea my way of marketing my game when I was making games and thought it that I wanted to be a game developer was creating a YouTube channel and doing tutorials so I don't the the tutorial part turned out pretty well the game part not so much so and now I'm here so I wouldn't really know too much about that but it's really about figuring out where is your audience and trying to tap into those to the streams available for that audience so in my case I thought my audience because my game was about making games thought would be game developers and so I thought I would try and tap into unity users and with the turtles so that's kind of how I got rolling so that's my thought process at least why Facebook post Twitter but not Instagram because I just don't use Instagram I don't know how it works I've never used it it's good did you create any games with mechanics like in these sim series not really can you make a meditation tutorial and unity yes that would be fun will you make it to turn on mobile game controls I try not to do too much platform specific stuff but maybe mobile game controls could be fun there are a lot of great also free assets for that can you make an advanced 2d platformer character controller not right now it's not on the roadmap they're a bunch of stuff in the asset store check that out do you plan to do a video about the new coop job system and entities components they seem to be awesome if I'm able to figure them out if they when they come out yes otherwise I might just leave that to your Kim so yeah okay can you make a tutorial to create portal I have a portal 2 tutorial on the YouTube I'm creating this called portal effect not the entire game but I'm sure you can figure something out based on that slowstar send realtime displacement tutorial that sounds fun a lot of graphic stuff guys I would love to do some more graphic stuff especially with the new shader editor and I think we are going to close it here alright questions are up we are closing it it's a wrap guys no more Christian being answered yes my voice is getting sore it's too much cold ah that's pretty much it that was the live stream guys hope you enjoyed it um all of that I just want to say thank you so much for
