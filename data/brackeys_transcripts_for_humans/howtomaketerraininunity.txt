With timestamps:

00:00 - one of the most fun parts about creating
00:01 - levels for a game is making your own
00:03 - terrain luckily unity has tools designed
00:05 - specifically to sculpt paint and detail
00:08 - terrain within the unity editor and
00:10 - these tools have recently been updated
00:11 - with a lot more features now we're
00:13 - making this video fairly early on in the
00:15 - development process of these features
00:17 - since we think it's a nice way for you
00:18 - guys to try out the tools and help
00:20 - improve on them in fact after we did a
00:22 - video on the new input system we talked
00:24 - to some folks at Unity and they've
00:26 - really taken a lot of the feedback from
00:27 - the comments section and are already
00:29 - implementing a lot of it into the next
00:31 - version which is just super cool so
00:33 - without further ado let's start making
00:35 - some terrain also this video is
00:37 - sponsored by unity now let's get to it
00:39 - so first of all you need to make sure
00:40 - that you're using unity 2019 point 1.5
00:43 - or later now with that we can go to
00:45 - window and open up the package manager
00:48 - here we need to make sure that we have
00:50 - all packages selected and go under
00:52 - advanced and select show preview
00:54 - packages at the time of recording this
00:56 - video the terrain system is still in
00:58 - preview and we should be able to search
01:00 - for it here and find terrain tolls as
01:03 - you can see I'm using version 1.1 point
01:05 - 4 now let's go ahead and install this
01:08 - unity is going to import the package and
01:10 - that's pretty much all the setup we need
01:12 - to do however unity has also created a
01:14 - package on the asset store with some
01:16 - sample terrain assets in fact that's
01:18 - what they're linking to right here now
01:21 - I'm not gonna click this instead I'm
01:22 - just going to go directly to the asset
01:24 - store tab remember you can always find
01:26 - this under window asset store and I'm
01:28 - simply going to search for the terrain
01:30 - sample assets the package right here as
01:33 - you can see it's free I'm simply going
01:35 - to download that and the cool thing
01:37 - about this pack is that it features more
01:39 - brushes that you can use while sculpting
01:41 - and painting as well as some cool sample
01:43 - textures that we can try out now let's
01:46 - hit import and import again and we are
01:48 - now completely set up as you can see in
01:51 - our assets here we now have a folder
01:52 - called samples with all of the terrain
01:55 - tools including brush textures terrain
01:57 - brushes layers and so on super cool so
02:01 - now it's time to create a new terrain
02:03 - and we can do this really quickly by
02:05 - simply right-clicking a hierarchy going
02:07 - 3d object and selecting terrain and
02:10 - right away this is going to spawn in a
02:12 - huge piece of terrain into our scene now
02:16 - I'm just gonna go ahead and disable the
02:17 - example assets in our sample scene here
02:19 - since we're not gonna be needing them so
02:21 - that is one way to very quickly create
02:23 - terrain however there is another way if
02:26 - we delete this piece of terrain and
02:28 - instead go to window terrain we can use
02:32 - the terrain toolbox and the terrain
02:35 - toolbox is a new window that allows us
02:36 - to easily set up terrains with specific
02:39 - settings change settings on multiple
02:41 - existing terrains at once and just
02:43 - overall smooth out the process of
02:45 - working with terrain so I'm simply going
02:47 - to take this and dark it next to the
02:49 - inspector over here as you can see we
02:51 - have some parameters here for the width
02:52 - length and height of our terrain you can
02:54 - set these to whatever you want I'm just
02:56 - gonna leave these as is and remember
02:58 - everything can be changed later so let's
03:01 - go ahead and hit create and as you can
03:03 - see right away it creates the terrain
03:04 - within our scene I'm gonna go back to
03:06 - the inspector here and let's have a look
03:08 - at what has happened here so if we go to
03:10 - a project first of all we now have a
03:11 - terrain folder and within this we have a
03:14 - terrain data object this stores all the
03:16 - information about our terrain such as
03:18 - where there are hills and slopes and
03:20 - what textures we apply you can also see
03:23 - that it's gone out and created an object
03:24 - in the hierarchy in fact it's both
03:26 - created a two-ring group and within this
03:28 - a terrain object this object has two
03:31 - components the terrain component which
03:33 - is used to configure our terrain and
03:35 - used to change our sculpting and
03:36 - painting settings as well as a two-ring
03:39 - Collider which creates a Collider so
03:41 - that physics objects will interact with
03:42 - our terrain so at this point we are
03:45 - ready to start sculpting our terrain I
03:47 - really recommend that when you're
03:48 - working with your terrain you go to the
03:50 - top of the scene here and make sure to
03:52 - disable fog so you can see everything
03:54 - clearly and that you also go to lighting
03:55 - and make sure that auto generate light
03:57 - Maps is turned off so with that let's
04:00 - get painting so the first thing that you
04:01 - want to do is go ahead and select the
04:03 - paint terrain tool here and with that
04:05 - selected we get a bunch of options first
04:08 - of all we want to make sure that we have
04:09 - raise or lower terrain selected here we
04:11 - can choose between all of the different
04:13 - brushes that we can use I'm just gonna
04:15 - choose an ordinary soft brush and if I
04:17 - just hover over my terrain now and try
04:19 - and press we can see that I can start
04:22 - sculpting to the right here you can
04:24 - change brush settings such as strength
04:26 - and
04:26 - sighs or you can do so using shortcuts
04:28 - the shortcut for strength is a so if I
04:31 - hold down a here I can adjust how much
04:33 - strength
04:33 - I want to apply with my brush in other
04:35 - words how much do I want to sculpt the
04:37 - terrain by holding down my mouse I can
04:40 - also adjust the size of my brush by
04:41 - holding down s and simply dragging here
04:44 - now I have a much larger brush and can
04:46 - make much larger changes to the terrain
04:49 - let's try out a bit more of an
04:50 - interesting brush here and if we hold
04:52 - down D we can also rotate it in any way
04:55 - that we'd like you can see just how easy
04:57 - it is to add in detail with brushes like
04:59 - these and of course all these shortcuts
05:01 - can be changed using this shortcut
05:03 - editor another cool thing is that if we
05:05 - hold down ctrl we can invert which
05:08 - allows us to lower it the terrain I'm
05:10 - gonna go ahead and reduce the size of my
05:11 - brush here and if we go ahead and change
05:13 - the spacing we can change how much
05:15 - distance we want between each individual
05:17 - brushstroke we can also use scattering
05:20 - to add random scatter to our brush which
05:22 - can lead to some pretty interesting
05:23 - effects now all of this is just by
05:26 - raising and lowering the terrain we also
05:28 - have other paint modes here such as set
05:30 - height which allows us to set the
05:32 - terrain to a certain height down here we
05:34 - can see the height that we're setting to
05:35 - let's try and change this to something
05:37 - like 90 let's do a soft brush let's
05:40 - increase the size of this brush as you
05:42 - can see we're now setting everything
05:43 - that we paint to this height really cool
05:46 - we also have another mode called smooth
05:48 - height this can also be accessed from
05:50 - other tools by simply holding shift
05:52 - because it's something that you use
05:54 - fairly frequently and it simply allows
05:56 - us to well smooth out parts of our
05:59 - terrain now this here is pretty extreme
06:01 - we can of course adjust the brush
06:02 - strength as with anything else to reduce
06:05 - the impact but it will definitely smooth
06:07 - out the terrain really cool
06:09 - another cool mode is undo sculpt and
06:11 - it's called
06:12 - noise and as the name suggests this
06:14 - simply allows us to paint noise onto our
06:17 - terrain we can go ahead and adjust
06:19 - settings for the noise down here most
06:22 - importantly we can adjust the scale of
06:24 - our noise let's translate it to
06:25 - something like 20 by 20 by 20 and as you
06:28 - can see I can now start to paint in this
06:31 - noise on top of our terrain this really
06:34 - easily allows us to add cool detail to
06:37 - our terrain especially if we go ahead
06:39 - and ink
06:39 - the strength of it you can see just how
06:41 - easy it is to create interesting results
06:44 - in fact under these modes you have a lot
06:46 - of really cool options to achieve
06:48 - certain effects so just add life to your
06:50 - terrain for example under sculpt here we
06:52 - also have the bridge mode which allows
06:54 - us to control click on a start point
06:57 - let's choose this one and then click on
06:59 - another place of our terrain to create a
07:01 - bridge across it this is super easy for
07:04 - creating world bridges or roads and can
07:07 - lead to some really interesting effects
07:09 - another cool thing is Terrace which as
07:12 - the name suggests will divide our
07:13 - terrain into terraces or layers when
07:17 - adjust the terrace count in order to
07:19 - change the appearance of this effect but
07:21 - it's definitely really handy if this is
07:22 - the look you're going for there are also
07:24 - some really cool brushes called erosion
07:26 - brushes you can see there's hydraulic
07:28 - thermal and wind I'm gonna select
07:30 - hydraulic here which erodes the terrain
07:32 - according to fluid simulation you can of
07:34 - course change some settings about that
07:36 - simulation down here but if I just go
07:38 - ahead and paint you can see how this is
07:40 - kind of smoothing and flattening out the
07:42 - terrain just like it would be if it was
07:44 - exposed to water over a longer period of
07:47 - time really cool and this is just some
07:50 - of the modes honestly there are so many
07:52 - more that I definitely recommend you
07:53 - play around with now if you're working
07:55 - on the terrain and realized some of your
07:56 - settings are off well you can always go
07:59 - to the last card tab here which is the
08:01 - terrain settings you can adjust a bunch
08:04 - of different things including our mesh
08:06 - resolution again the width length and
08:08 - height of our terrain and in fact one
08:11 - thing that I recommend is scaling your
08:13 - terrain to be larger while working on it
08:16 - in fact I've found bumping up your
08:17 - resolution on the width length and
08:19 - height to over 2000 while working on the
08:21 - terrain is really really nice and then
08:23 - you can always go ahead and decrease it
08:25 - later and it will still keep a lot of
08:27 - the detail remember if you need to
08:29 - adjust settings on multiple terrains you
08:31 - can always use the terrain toolbox to do
08:33 - that you don't have to go to each one
08:34 - individually now another cool thing
08:36 - about the terrain system is that it
08:38 - allows us to string together multiple
08:40 - terrain tasks this is cool because you
08:43 - don't always want your terrain to be
08:44 - completely square so if we go to the
08:47 - first button here we can create neighbor
08:49 - terrains and we do this simply by
08:52 - clicking and I
08:53 - you can see the really cool thing about
08:55 - this is that height data is going to
08:57 - transfer seamlessly onto the terrain in
09:00 - fact we can go ahead and create neighbor
09:02 - terrains on all sides here and if we go
09:05 - in here we can now start to paint across
09:08 - all of these different terrains so if
09:10 - you're just going and race and lower the
09:12 - terrain you can see that I can do so on
09:14 - multiple terrains at once awesome now
09:18 - for this to work you need to make sure
09:19 - that all of your terrains are sharing
09:22 - the same group ID as you can see all of
09:24 - these terrains have a grouping ID of
09:27 - zero and they also all need to have the
09:30 - same resolution just a heads up so I'm
09:33 - gonna go ahead and delete all these new
09:34 - terrains here and just try and focus on
09:37 - this thing of one so the next part of
09:39 - the process is painting and we also do
09:42 - that of course using the paintbrush but
09:44 - we need to change the mode to paint
09:47 - texture and when painting onto terrain
09:49 - we are working with what is called
09:51 - terrain layers and as you can see
09:53 - currently there are no layers here so
09:55 - let's go ahead and hit edit terrain
09:56 - layers and here we can either create a
09:58 - layer or add an existing layer let's try
10:01 - and create one this is going to open up
10:03 - a panel where we can select a texture
10:05 - I'm just gonna go it and select a symbol
10:07 - of dirt texture this is from the terrain
10:09 - samples pack I'm gonna double click on
10:11 - it and right away you can see that it's
10:13 - added this texture as a terrain layer
10:14 - you also see that we now have an object
10:17 - in a project called new layer let's go
10:19 - ahead and call this one dirt layer and
10:21 - in here we have settings such as the
10:24 - diffuse map we can also input a normal
10:26 - map so I'm gonna go ahead and input the
10:28 - dirt normal here as well as a mask map
10:30 - where I'm gonna put the third mask we're
10:33 - gonna just stuff like metallic Ness and
10:35 - smoothness in here and you can see it
10:37 - applies to our entire terrain and of
10:39 - course also texture tiling and if we
10:41 - zoom in we can see that the texture is
10:44 - actually here it's just being tiled a
10:46 - whole bunch so we can go ahead and of
10:48 - course adjust the tile size here to kind
10:51 - of change that around but of course
10:54 - right now we only have a single layer
10:56 - let's go ahead and add some more so I'm
10:58 - gonna hit add layer here and I'm gonna
11:00 - select some of the ones that are already
11:01 - in this sample assets I'm gonna select
11:03 - rock I'm also going to add a sand
11:06 - lair Squealer let's add some snow and
11:10 - some moss and at this point we're ready
11:12 - to just start painting so I'm gonna
11:15 - increase the size of my brush here you
11:17 - can play around with the opacity and I'm
11:19 - gonna start adding rock to my mountains
11:22 - I'm also going to add some moss in here
11:24 - just kind of scatter it around again
11:27 - guys this is not gonna be pretty just
11:29 - showing off the tools I'm gonna add a
11:31 - tiny bit of screen here let's add some
11:34 - sand along the sides don't ask me why
11:36 - this end on the top and finally we're
11:38 - gonna paint in some snow just a tiny bit
11:41 - at the top of these slopes here in fact
11:43 - I'm gonna go ahead and use a different
11:44 - brush so that we can kind of scatter
11:46 - this around again not going for any
11:48 - awards here and there you go it's that
11:50 - easy to start sculpting and painting it
11:53 - terrain with these tools as you also
11:55 - mentioned that the unity environment
11:56 - team is working on a brush pack for
11:58 - texturing that is scheduled for 2019
12:00 - point two so we'll have more cool
12:02 - brushes and I know I haven't touched on
12:04 - these two icons here they are for
12:07 - painting trees and foliage onto your
12:09 - terrain now this is for another video
12:11 - just know that the option is here and
12:13 - that it works very similar to painting
12:14 - textures and finally I just want to show
12:17 - you one of my favorite features which is
12:19 - the ability to create a terrain from a
12:21 - height map now if you don't know what a
12:23 - height map is I have an example of it
12:26 - right here as you can see it's a
12:27 - black-and-white image that stores height
12:29 - information white parts are high black
12:33 - parts are low and there are a lot of
12:36 - free height maps online I would
12:38 - definitely recommend just doing a quick
12:39 - search for height map and just by going
12:41 - to images you can see just how many are
12:43 - readily available here now the format of
12:46 - your heart map needs to be dot raw you
12:48 - can use a photo editing software like
12:50 - Photoshop or to export this raw in
12:52 - case you find a JPEG or PNG or any other
12:55 - format in Photoshop it's as easy as
12:57 - going file save as and selecting
13:00 - Photoshop wrong in fact I've gone it and
13:02 - prepared a height map draw right here
13:04 - let's simply drag this into unity to
13:07 - import it we then go to the terrain
13:09 - toolbox let's create a new terrain but
13:11 - let's do so by importing a height map so
13:14 - I'm gonna check this checkbox right here
13:16 - I'm gonna select a height map file
13:17 - simply clicking this I'm gonna browse to
13:20 - the height
13:20 - unless you can see we can change the
13:22 - height resolution this doesn't have to
13:24 - be the same as the height map you can
13:25 - make it a greater resolution if you want
13:27 - I'm just gonna keep it at 512 we can
13:29 - then remap our height map in any way
13:31 - that we'd like I'm just gonna make it
13:33 - less tall here so I'm going to decrease
13:34 - the max we also need to make sure that
13:36 - we aren't creating this in the same
13:38 - grouping ID as our previous terrain so
13:40 - I'm gonna set this to 1 and let's now
13:42 - try and hit create and as you can see
13:44 - it's going to spawn this right on top
13:46 - but we've now created a terrain based on
13:49 - that height map and I think it looks
13:51 - really really cool and hard maps are
13:54 - just really great to use they are really
13:56 - easy to get inspired by and just gives
13:58 - you a really solid base to work off of
14:00 - finally what you've created the terrain
14:02 - that you'd like simply go back into
14:04 - lighting and re-enable Auto generate and
14:06 - it's then going to generate a light map
14:08 - for your terrain awesome that's pretty

Cleaned transcript:

one of the most fun parts about creating levels for a game is making your own terrain luckily unity has tools designed specifically to sculpt paint and detail terrain within the unity editor and these tools have recently been updated with a lot more features now we're making this video fairly early on in the development process of these features since we think it's a nice way for you guys to try out the tools and help improve on them in fact after we did a video on the new input system we talked to some folks at Unity and they've really taken a lot of the feedback from the comments section and are already implementing a lot of it into the next version which is just super cool so without further ado let's start making some terrain also this video is sponsored by unity now let's get to it so first of all you need to make sure that you're using unity 2019 point 1.5 or later now with that we can go to window and open up the package manager here we need to make sure that we have all packages selected and go under advanced and select show preview packages at the time of recording this video the terrain system is still in preview and we should be able to search for it here and find terrain tolls as you can see I'm using version 1.1 point 4 now let's go ahead and install this unity is going to import the package and that's pretty much all the setup we need to do however unity has also created a package on the asset store with some sample terrain assets in fact that's what they're linking to right here now I'm not gonna click this instead I'm just going to go directly to the asset store tab remember you can always find this under window asset store and I'm simply going to search for the terrain sample assets the package right here as you can see it's free I'm simply going to download that and the cool thing about this pack is that it features more brushes that you can use while sculpting and painting as well as some cool sample textures that we can try out now let's hit import and import again and we are now completely set up as you can see in our assets here we now have a folder called samples with all of the terrain tools including brush textures terrain brushes layers and so on super cool so now it's time to create a new terrain and we can do this really quickly by simply rightclicking a hierarchy going 3d object and selecting terrain and right away this is going to spawn in a huge piece of terrain into our scene now I'm just gonna go ahead and disable the example assets in our sample scene here since we're not gonna be needing them so that is one way to very quickly create terrain however there is another way if we delete this piece of terrain and instead go to window terrain we can use the terrain toolbox and the terrain toolbox is a new window that allows us to easily set up terrains with specific settings change settings on multiple existing terrains at once and just overall smooth out the process of working with terrain so I'm simply going to take this and dark it next to the inspector over here as you can see we have some parameters here for the width length and height of our terrain you can set these to whatever you want I'm just gonna leave these as is and remember everything can be changed later so let's go ahead and hit create and as you can see right away it creates the terrain within our scene I'm gonna go back to the inspector here and let's have a look at what has happened here so if we go to a project first of all we now have a terrain folder and within this we have a terrain data object this stores all the information about our terrain such as where there are hills and slopes and what textures we apply you can also see that it's gone out and created an object in the hierarchy in fact it's both created a tworing group and within this a terrain object this object has two components the terrain component which is used to configure our terrain and used to change our sculpting and painting settings as well as a tworing Collider which creates a Collider so that physics objects will interact with our terrain so at this point we are ready to start sculpting our terrain I really recommend that when you're working with your terrain you go to the top of the scene here and make sure to disable fog so you can see everything clearly and that you also go to lighting and make sure that auto generate light Maps is turned off so with that let's get painting so the first thing that you want to do is go ahead and select the paint terrain tool here and with that selected we get a bunch of options first of all we want to make sure that we have raise or lower terrain selected here we can choose between all of the different brushes that we can use I'm just gonna choose an ordinary soft brush and if I just hover over my terrain now and try and press we can see that I can start sculpting to the right here you can change brush settings such as strength and sighs or you can do so using shortcuts the shortcut for strength is a so if I hold down a here I can adjust how much strength I want to apply with my brush in other words how much do I want to sculpt the terrain by holding down my mouse I can also adjust the size of my brush by holding down s and simply dragging here now I have a much larger brush and can make much larger changes to the terrain let's try out a bit more of an interesting brush here and if we hold down D we can also rotate it in any way that we'd like you can see just how easy it is to add in detail with brushes like these and of course all these shortcuts can be changed using this shortcut editor another cool thing is that if we hold down ctrl we can invert which allows us to lower it the terrain I'm gonna go ahead and reduce the size of my brush here and if we go ahead and change the spacing we can change how much distance we want between each individual brushstroke we can also use scattering to add random scatter to our brush which can lead to some pretty interesting effects now all of this is just by raising and lowering the terrain we also have other paint modes here such as set height which allows us to set the terrain to a certain height down here we can see the height that we're setting to let's try and change this to something like 90 let's do a soft brush let's increase the size of this brush as you can see we're now setting everything that we paint to this height really cool we also have another mode called smooth height this can also be accessed from other tools by simply holding shift because it's something that you use fairly frequently and it simply allows us to well smooth out parts of our terrain now this here is pretty extreme we can of course adjust the brush strength as with anything else to reduce the impact but it will definitely smooth out the terrain really cool another cool mode is undo sculpt and it's called noise and as the name suggests this simply allows us to paint noise onto our terrain we can go ahead and adjust settings for the noise down here most importantly we can adjust the scale of our noise let's translate it to something like 20 by 20 by 20 and as you can see I can now start to paint in this noise on top of our terrain this really easily allows us to add cool detail to our terrain especially if we go ahead and ink the strength of it you can see just how easy it is to create interesting results in fact under these modes you have a lot of really cool options to achieve certain effects so just add life to your terrain for example under sculpt here we also have the bridge mode which allows us to control click on a start point let's choose this one and then click on another place of our terrain to create a bridge across it this is super easy for creating world bridges or roads and can lead to some really interesting effects another cool thing is Terrace which as the name suggests will divide our terrain into terraces or layers when adjust the terrace count in order to change the appearance of this effect but it's definitely really handy if this is the look you're going for there are also some really cool brushes called erosion brushes you can see there's hydraulic thermal and wind I'm gonna select hydraulic here which erodes the terrain according to fluid simulation you can of course change some settings about that simulation down here but if I just go ahead and paint you can see how this is kind of smoothing and flattening out the terrain just like it would be if it was exposed to water over a longer period of time really cool and this is just some of the modes honestly there are so many more that I definitely recommend you play around with now if you're working on the terrain and realized some of your settings are off well you can always go to the last card tab here which is the terrain settings you can adjust a bunch of different things including our mesh resolution again the width length and height of our terrain and in fact one thing that I recommend is scaling your terrain to be larger while working on it in fact I've found bumping up your resolution on the width length and height to over 2000 while working on the terrain is really really nice and then you can always go ahead and decrease it later and it will still keep a lot of the detail remember if you need to adjust settings on multiple terrains you can always use the terrain toolbox to do that you don't have to go to each one individually now another cool thing about the terrain system is that it allows us to string together multiple terrain tasks this is cool because you don't always want your terrain to be completely square so if we go to the first button here we can create neighbor terrains and we do this simply by clicking and I you can see the really cool thing about this is that height data is going to transfer seamlessly onto the terrain in fact we can go ahead and create neighbor terrains on all sides here and if we go in here we can now start to paint across all of these different terrains so if you're just going and race and lower the terrain you can see that I can do so on multiple terrains at once awesome now for this to work you need to make sure that all of your terrains are sharing the same group ID as you can see all of these terrains have a grouping ID of zero and they also all need to have the same resolution just a heads up so I'm gonna go ahead and delete all these new terrains here and just try and focus on this thing of one so the next part of the process is painting and we also do that of course using the paintbrush but we need to change the mode to paint texture and when painting onto terrain we are working with what is called terrain layers and as you can see currently there are no layers here so let's go ahead and hit edit terrain layers and here we can either create a layer or add an existing layer let's try and create one this is going to open up a panel where we can select a texture I'm just gonna go it and select a symbol of dirt texture this is from the terrain samples pack I'm gonna double click on it and right away you can see that it's added this texture as a terrain layer you also see that we now have an object in a project called new layer let's go ahead and call this one dirt layer and in here we have settings such as the diffuse map we can also input a normal map so I'm gonna go ahead and input the dirt normal here as well as a mask map where I'm gonna put the third mask we're gonna just stuff like metallic Ness and smoothness in here and you can see it applies to our entire terrain and of course also texture tiling and if we zoom in we can see that the texture is actually here it's just being tiled a whole bunch so we can go ahead and of course adjust the tile size here to kind of change that around but of course right now we only have a single layer let's go ahead and add some more so I'm gonna hit add layer here and I'm gonna select some of the ones that are already in this sample assets I'm gonna select rock I'm also going to add a sand lair Squealer let's add some snow and some moss and at this point we're ready to just start painting so I'm gonna increase the size of my brush here you can play around with the opacity and I'm gonna start adding rock to my mountains I'm also going to add some moss in here just kind of scatter it around again guys this is not gonna be pretty just showing off the tools I'm gonna add a tiny bit of screen here let's add some sand along the sides don't ask me why this end on the top and finally we're gonna paint in some snow just a tiny bit at the top of these slopes here in fact I'm gonna go ahead and use a different brush so that we can kind of scatter this around again not going for any awards here and there you go it's that easy to start sculpting and painting it terrain with these tools as you also mentioned that the unity environment team is working on a brush pack for texturing that is scheduled for 2019 point two so we'll have more cool brushes and I know I haven't touched on these two icons here they are for painting trees and foliage onto your terrain now this is for another video just know that the option is here and that it works very similar to painting textures and finally I just want to show you one of my favorite features which is the ability to create a terrain from a height map now if you don't know what a height map is I have an example of it right here as you can see it's a blackandwhite image that stores height information white parts are high black parts are low and there are a lot of free height maps online I would definitely recommend just doing a quick search for height map and just by going to images you can see just how many are readily available here now the format of your heart map needs to be dot raw you can use a photo editing software like Photoshop or to export this raw in case you find a JPEG or PNG or any other format in Photoshop it's as easy as going file save as and selecting Photoshop wrong in fact I've gone it and prepared a height map draw right here let's simply drag this into unity to import it we then go to the terrain toolbox let's create a new terrain but let's do so by importing a height map so I'm gonna check this checkbox right here I'm gonna select a height map file simply clicking this I'm gonna browse to the height unless you can see we can change the height resolution this doesn't have to be the same as the height map you can make it a greater resolution if you want I'm just gonna keep it at 512 we can then remap our height map in any way that we'd like I'm just gonna make it less tall here so I'm going to decrease the max we also need to make sure that we aren't creating this in the same grouping ID as our previous terrain so I'm gonna set this to 1 and let's now try and hit create and as you can see it's going to spawn this right on top but we've now created a terrain based on that height map and I think it looks really really cool and hard maps are just really great to use they are really easy to get inspired by and just gives you a really solid base to work off of finally what you've created the terrain that you'd like simply go back into lighting and reenable Auto generate and it's then going to generate a light map for your terrain awesome that's pretty much it for
