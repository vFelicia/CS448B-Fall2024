00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:04 - this video in creating a tower defense
00:06 - game in unity today we are going to be
00:07 - creating a main menu for our game a lot
00:09 - of you guys have asked for this so now
00:11 - we're going to do it so let me just jump
00:14 - right into Unity here and basically what
00:16 - I wanted to do was kind of make our menu
00:18 - feel 3D so we'll uh have some kind of
00:22 - turret as the um main element for our
00:25 - menu and then we'll Place some UI around
00:27 - that turret that uh is actually active
00:30 - in the 3D scene so if we just go ahead
00:33 - and duplicate our main scene here and
00:35 - rename this to main menu and actually I
00:39 - want to rename the main scene to main
00:41 - level instead then we can double click
00:44 - to open up the main menu you can see
00:46 - that up here and we can go ahead and get
00:49 - rid of a lot of this stuff we pretty
00:50 - much want to delete everything except
00:53 - for the main camera the directional
00:55 - light the environment and I believe that
00:58 - was pretty much it so for all of the
01:00 - other stuff we'll just go ahead and hit
01:02 - delete and you can see that cleans
01:04 - everything out and inside of our envir
01:06 - in our environment you want to take a
01:09 - ground plane and move that out and just
01:11 - delete all of the rest so now we just
01:13 - have this empty level with some of the
01:15 - same settings that we used for our main
01:17 - level then what we can do is we can kind
01:20 - of find a subject for our scene so let's
01:23 - go under prefabs and let's take say the
01:25 - standard turret and use this um uh by
01:29 - simply dragging it into the Hier key and
01:32 - let's reset the transform on it to
01:34 - center it on our level here let's also
01:37 - move it down so I believe it's .5 in
01:41 - order to place it directly on the ground
01:43 - that is correct and what we can do then
01:45 - is kind of position this where we want
01:48 - it to be in our picture so somewhere
01:51 - around here and then a really really
01:53 - neat trick is you can take the main
01:55 - camera and you can snap it to the
01:57 - current view of our scene by simply
01:59 - selecting it and going to the scene and
02:01 - hitting control shift F and that's
02:03 - command shift F if you're on the Mac and
02:06 - you can see it just snaps over there and
02:08 - I might want to move it just a tiny bit
02:10 - to the left here so I'm just going to do
02:12 - that by middle Mouse dragging and you
02:14 - can see that it now just snaps over so
02:17 - this makes it much easier to position
02:19 - the camera in a cool and interesting way
02:22 - than U moving up the transform which is
02:24 - up here so next up is kind of adjusting
02:27 - our Skybox here because that doesn't
02:29 - look too great right now what we'll do
02:32 - instead is we'll change this to a solid
02:34 - color and then we'll have the color be
02:37 - whatever the ending color out here is
02:39 - and that is going to ensure that we have
02:41 - a nice smooth transition from the um
02:45 - actual ground plane here uh to the
02:47 - Skybox it's a very neat little effect
02:50 - that looks uh super cool because it
02:52 - creates this feeling of an endless empty
02:54 - space uh but it's so so simple so we can
02:57 - just take uh choose the color pick here
03:00 - and choose the color at the very edge
03:02 - and you can see the effect that this
03:04 - gives us kind of a uh really uh
03:07 - huge environment with pretty much
03:10 - nothing in it uh so yeah I really like
03:13 - this and then of course you can do stuff
03:15 - like ajust the turret to how you want it
03:17 - you can uh take the um directional light
03:20 - here and you can rotate it around if
03:22 - you're not satisfied with where the sun
03:25 - is shining and uh stuff like that but I
03:28 - actually think that um everything is in
03:30 - a pretty nice place already and that we
03:32 - don't need to do a lot to change this so
03:35 - next up is kind of adding some some UI
03:38 - elements to our scene and also I wanted
03:40 - to throw in here that we're currently
03:42 - using these graphics for turrets uh but
03:45 - I actually have uh some plans to maybe
03:47 - switch some of this stuff out with some
03:49 - more advanced Graphics down the line so
03:52 - that's going to be really exciting but
03:53 - for now we'll be using this guy and we
03:55 - can use pretty much anything for this
03:57 - because what we're going to do is we're
03:58 - going to take our standard turret and
04:00 - we're going to remove the turret script
04:02 - and we're also going to kind of um break
04:05 - this as a prefab uh connection so this
04:08 - is currently still linked to a prefab
04:10 - down here and we don't want it uh to um
04:13 - be linked that way because we want to U
04:15 - remove a firepoint we want to get rid of
04:18 - this component and so we'll just go
04:20 - under object and or game object and
04:23 - select break prefab instance and and now
04:26 - it's not connected in any way and so we
04:28 - can go ahead and delete the the
04:30 - firepoint and uh everything else uh can
04:32 - just be left as is so what we'll then do
04:36 - is uh go in um and I'll Place some UI
04:39 - stuff so let's go ahead and create a new
04:41 - canvas for this so let's go UI whoops
04:44 - not particle system UI and then just
04:46 - text that's going to create a new text
04:48 - object in this huge canvas and uh let's
04:52 - just make sure that this text object
04:53 - scales with our canvas and let's also
04:56 - set the font size to something like 80
04:59 - and let's change the text here to say
05:03 - play then we can take our font and
05:05 - change that to
05:07 - robotto let's do robotto medium and
05:11 - let's change the color to white and we
05:14 - can maybe also add a bit of a shadow so
05:16 - let's just go Shadow here let's um turn
05:19 - that down a tiny bit and let's do two
05:22 - and -2 just to kind of give it a bit of
05:24 - an outline um so yeah all of the other
05:27 - settings we can pretty much leave as is
05:30 - except for one thing and that is
05:32 - currently our canvas is size to uh the
05:35 - uh size of our screen instead we want
05:37 - this to be wall space and remember we've
05:39 - done wall space canvases before and the
05:41 - thing about those is you of course have
05:43 - to adjust this to kind of fit the size
05:45 - of our text but we also have to go in
05:48 - here and adjust the scale because it's
05:50 - currently huge compared to a standard
05:52 - tur you can see here just how much we
05:55 - actually have to zoom out so what we'll
05:57 - do is go and find our scale here and put
05:59 - that at say
06:02 - 0.004 and I played around with this
06:04 - earlier and found that this was a value
06:06 - that worked pretty great so we're just
06:08 - going to at least begin with that let's
06:11 - put our position at zero and our Y at
06:13 - zero and that should place it inside of
06:16 - our turret so now we can just move this
06:18 - up and we can simply drag this um over
06:22 - if we want it to stay down here and I
06:24 - think actually we want one of our
06:26 - elements to be here maybe the quit
06:28 - button and then we can have play sit on
06:30 - top of the turret itself so let's take
06:32 - our play here now and rotate this by
06:36 - 90° and let's make sure that it sits
06:39 - pretty much on top of our turret which
06:42 - it looks like it does but it doesn't
06:44 - look too great from this angle so let's
06:46 - now move it down a bit and also drag it
06:49 - over uh to something like there uh it
06:52 - just looks nicer over in this
06:55 - view something like that cool and one we
06:59 - then need to do is of course turn this
07:01 - into a button so let's just rename the
07:03 - canvas here to something like top turret
07:08 - canvas and the text here to play button
07:12 - and currently this is only a text object
07:14 - so let's just add a new component button
07:16 - and the cool thing about adding a button
07:18 - component to a text object is that Unity
07:20 - will just go ahead and set everything up
07:22 - for you so uh right away and this is
07:24 - another thing we have to do we have to
07:26 - remove the camera controller on the
07:27 - camera so it doesn't snap to another
07:29 - location right away we should be able to
07:32 - click it and you can see that something
07:33 - happen so it's already turned into a
07:35 - button so all we really need to do now
07:38 - is just uh adjust some settings we can
07:40 - add an on click event which we'll create
07:42 - in a second but we can also maybe um
07:45 - change the animation here so currently
07:47 - we're just tining the color of the
07:49 - object what I want to do instead is
07:51 - utilize the fact that in the last video
07:54 - we created a much nicer hover animation
07:57 - uh by scaling the size of our UI so or a
08:00 - UI element so let's go and choose
08:02 - animation here and uh for navigation we
08:05 - want none and we could go ahead and
08:07 - autogenerate the animation and then go
08:09 - down into the animation tab here and
08:11 - edit them to create our own unique
08:13 - animation or we could just use the
08:15 - animation that we created in the last
08:17 - video so let's just go and hit add
08:19 - component add an animator and as the
08:21 - controller here we want to select the
08:23 - button controller that we previously
08:25 - created and remember the only special
08:27 - thing about this is that it has a a
08:30 - normal animation which has a scale of
08:32 - 111 a highlighted animation which has a
08:35 - scale of 1.05 and it actually also
08:38 - animates a tiny bit but you don't have
08:40 - to put that in there and then we have
08:42 - the Pressed which goes back to
08:44 - 111 and it's all that this is so now
08:47 - when we go in and hit play u we can see
08:49 - that it does this nice hover animation
08:52 - and when we click it it goes and becomes
08:56 - small very
08:57 - quickly cool so so um I believe that's
09:00 - all we really want to set up for on this
09:03 - object we could actually make make it a
09:06 - tiny bit bigger let's just try and see
09:09 - what happens should we just size up this
09:12 - canvas a tiny bit and um maybe increase
09:16 - the size of our text let's just try it
09:19 - out just for fun so let's take our text
09:23 - object here and increase the font size
09:24 - to say 100 and I actually like that a
09:27 - bit better because this is our play
09:29 - button and it's what we want our users
09:31 - to interact with right away I think it's
09:34 - okay to make this really really
09:36 - big so yeah something like that looks
09:41 - nice over here and that's the primary
09:42 - focus and then what we can do is um
09:45 - maybe duplicate this top turret canvas
09:47 - and we can then um rotate this by 0°
09:52 - really so we want to just snap that back
09:55 - and we can move it over here and I want
09:57 - this to be a lot uh smaller and o want
09:59 - to snap it over with an uh a z position
10:02 - of zero and uh I want this to say quit
10:06 - so this is going to be our uh Barrel
10:09 - canvas and it's going to just have a
10:12 - quit button whoops quit
10:15 - Buton and uh the font size here should
10:18 - be something like 80 actually we should
10:21 - make it less we should make it all the
10:23 - way down to say um 40 almost we don't
10:27 - want people to in check with this
10:28 - element and um we could put something
10:31 - like a robot light robotto light or even
10:35 - thin in here I think actually the thin
10:38 - works pretty well so let's just try that
10:41 - out and let's s back to 2D here and
10:43 - let's resize our canvas so we don't have
10:46 - this huge unnecessary canvas and we can
10:48 - move the entire thing over so that it
10:51 - sits on top of the barrel and then of
10:53 - course we'll have to put uh quit in here
10:57 - as the text and I think that already
11:00 - looks pretty decent I mean we can of
11:02 - course uh spend some time getting the
11:05 - positioning and feel of this uh exactly
11:08 - right but it should already be working
11:10 - and you can see that just the way that
11:12 - we set up our play to have this hover
11:13 - animation our quid Buon button does as
11:17 - well so really the only thing that's
11:19 - left is kind of hooking up these buttons
11:21 - to a script that will uh actually call
11:24 - or that has some functions that we can
11:26 - call from the buttons uh for playing the
11:30 - game which means transitioning to the
11:32 - main level scene or quitting which means
11:35 - just calling application. quit which
11:37 - will close down the
11:38 - build so um but actually what I want to
11:42 - do is also make this feel a bit more 3D
11:47 - because right now we could have really
11:48 - just hand painted this and I think we
11:50 - should re utilize the fact that we just
11:52 - built a 3D scene for our main menu and a
11:56 - way that we could do this is um by
11:58 - having the the turret here rotate um a
12:02 - little bit to uh kind of give the
12:04 - impression that it's aiming back and
12:06 - forth and this will uh of course we will
12:08 - have our UI elements follow the uh
12:11 - rotation of our turet I think that could
12:12 - look pretty cool also one thing that I
12:15 - might want to do is move our camera in a
12:17 - little closer but actually I kind of
12:20 - like that it's a bit distant so we'll
12:21 - just keep it this way for now so let's
12:24 - begin by hooking up our UI elements and
12:26 - then I'll show you I'll show you how we
12:28 - can do that rotation thing so um in
12:31 - order to uh kind of create some of the
12:33 - functionality around these buttons um
12:35 - what we could do is just create an empty
12:38 - object and reset the transform and I'm
12:39 - sorry for the noise here that's my cat
12:41 - playing around with um my water so um I
12:44 - will rename this to say main
12:49 - menu and we'll put that at the top and
12:52 - we'll just add a component here that is
12:54 - called main menu then let's double click
12:57 - this to open it up in uh visual studio
13:00 - and I'm just going to have a sip of
13:01 - water while we do
13:04 - that cool and um basically what I want
13:08 - to do is just create two very very
13:10 - simple public functions in here I want a
13:12 - public void called uh
13:15 - play and a public void a public
13:20 - void called um let's say whoops that's
13:25 - another cat stepping on the keyboard
13:27 - this is going crazy I should really lock
13:28 - those out of the room while do these
13:30 - videos they're pretty much in every
13:32 - single one I think it's a bit exciting
13:34 - for them uh so public void I'm going to
13:36 - call this one
13:37 - quit and uh basically what we'll do is
13:41 - um just throw a debug.log statement for
13:43 - now so we'll just say um play and we'll
13:48 - say um
13:50 - quit cool and then we'll go inside of
13:53 - unity and we'll find our top turret
13:56 - canvas which is our play button We'll
13:58 - add add an on click event so uh close
14:01 - all of this down and then under the
14:02 - button We'll add an on click event and
14:05 - we'll reference our main menu go down
14:07 - under the main menu script and call play
14:10 - and we'll do the exact same thing for
14:12 - our Barrel canvas so again here on the
14:14 - button add on click reference the menu
14:17 - go under the main menu script and call
14:20 - quit so now when we have play we should
14:22 - see in the console here that ignoring
14:24 - these uh Stupid errors when we hit play
14:28 - it says play and when we hit quit it
14:30 - says quit cool so all we really need to
14:33 - do now is just add a tiny bit of
14:35 - functionality so we'll be importing
14:37 - Unity engine. scene Management in order
14:40 - to load a new scene and we'll do that by
14:42 - going scene manager. load scene and then
14:45 - the um string or the name of that scene
14:49 - which is going to be main level but
14:51 - instead of hardcoding this in Let's uh
14:53 - make this editable inside the inspector
14:55 - so let's just create a public string
14:57 - which is going to be our level to load
15:01 - and we'll set that equal to main level
15:03 - by default and instead of putting in a
15:05 - string here we'll put level to load and
15:08 - in terms of quitting out of the
15:09 - application let's actually put a debug
15:12 - log statement in here saying something
15:13 - like exiting
15:16 - exitting and then we'll put in
15:19 - application. quit call that's all we
15:22 - need to do that is going to close down
15:24 - the application whether on Mac or on
15:26 - Windows it's going to just exit out and
15:29 - the reason why I'm putting exiting in
15:31 - here is because that's actually not
15:33 - visible in the inspector so or in the
15:35 - editor when we call application. quit in
15:37 - the editor absolutely nothing happens so
15:40 - it's just to let ourselves know that we
15:42 - pressed the quit button cool so now we
15:45 - can just go in here and we can hit play
15:47 - and we should see also under the main
15:49 - menu that we now have a level to load
15:50 - variable and we can hit quit and it's
15:53 - going to say exiting and we can hit play
15:55 - and it's going to transition to the next
15:57 - level where we can play
16:00 - awesome so that's really really easy and
16:02 - because we now have multiple levels in
16:04 - here what we want to do is go to file
16:06 - build settings and we want to make sure
16:08 - that we have our main level added here
16:10 - and that we also have our main menu and
16:13 - that our main menu is set up to uh be
16:16 - before the main level with a smaller
16:19 - build index that means that it will be
16:21 - loaded first so now when we start up the
16:23 - game if we were to build this we would
16:25 - see our main main menu and then we would
16:28 - use that trend
17:29 - parent them to that object just drag
17:32 - them in to make them Childs of that
17:34 - object and now when we rotate that the
17:36 - UI elements are rotating as well and you
17:39 - can create a script to control this you
17:41 - could have enemies go by and this one
17:43 - follow it that could be pretty fun or we
17:46 - could just go in here and create a very
17:48 - simple animation select the correct
17:50 - object the parts to rotate object hit
17:52 - create go on the animation and we'll
17:55 - call this one the turret menu um
17:59 - anim and all we really want to do here
18:02 - is have the first key frame kind of over
18:05 - here maybe we still want to be able to
18:08 - see and and click on our play button and
18:11 - then have the next animation which is
18:13 - going to be like 4 seconds in be around
18:18 - say
18:20 - here something around there and then
18:24 - again after 8 seconds we'll go back to
18:26 - this
18:27 - place there go so just copy the initial
18:30 - key frames and let's also smooth this
18:32 - out by going and selecting all of the
18:34 - key frames and selecting flat so now
18:37 - when we hit play whoops play from the
18:40 - beginning here you can see that we have
18:42 - this nice and slow aiming animation and
18:45 - it's enough that you can easily still
18:47 - click on the buttons but it just adds a
18:49 - bit of fun and interactivity into our
18:52 - main level or our main menu and really
18:55 - utilizes the fact that we are are uh we
18:58 - have have implemented this menu in 3D so
19:02 - that was pretty much all I wanted to
19:03 - show you this is the final result I hope
19:06 - you enjoyed this video let me know what
19:08 - you want to see next of course I have
19:09 - some ideas but still I could use more
19:12 - and uh yeah thanks for all of the kind
19:13 - feedback I'm really enjoying making
19:15 - these videos and without further Ado I
19:17 - will see you in the next one thanks to

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to this video in creating a tower defense game in unity today we are going to be creating a main menu for our game a lot of you guys have asked for this so now we're going to do it so let me just jump right into Unity here and basically what I wanted to do was kind of make our menu feel 3D so we'll uh have some kind of turret as the um main element for our menu and then we'll Place some UI around that turret that uh is actually active in the 3D scene so if we just go ahead and duplicate our main scene here and rename this to main menu and actually I want to rename the main scene to main level instead then we can double click to open up the main menu you can see that up here and we can go ahead and get rid of a lot of this stuff we pretty much want to delete everything except for the main camera the directional light the environment and I believe that was pretty much it so for all of the other stuff we'll just go ahead and hit delete and you can see that cleans everything out and inside of our envir in our environment you want to take a ground plane and move that out and just delete all of the rest so now we just have this empty level with some of the same settings that we used for our main level then what we can do is we can kind of find a subject for our scene so let's go under prefabs and let's take say the standard turret and use this um uh by simply dragging it into the Hier key and let's reset the transform on it to center it on our level here let's also move it down so I believe it's .5 in order to place it directly on the ground that is correct and what we can do then is kind of position this where we want it to be in our picture so somewhere around here and then a really really neat trick is you can take the main camera and you can snap it to the current view of our scene by simply selecting it and going to the scene and hitting control shift F and that's command shift F if you're on the Mac and you can see it just snaps over there and I might want to move it just a tiny bit to the left here so I'm just going to do that by middle Mouse dragging and you can see that it now just snaps over so this makes it much easier to position the camera in a cool and interesting way than U moving up the transform which is up here so next up is kind of adjusting our Skybox here because that doesn't look too great right now what we'll do instead is we'll change this to a solid color and then we'll have the color be whatever the ending color out here is and that is going to ensure that we have a nice smooth transition from the um actual ground plane here uh to the Skybox it's a very neat little effect that looks uh super cool because it creates this feeling of an endless empty space uh but it's so so simple so we can just take uh choose the color pick here and choose the color at the very edge and you can see the effect that this gives us kind of a uh really uh huge environment with pretty much nothing in it uh so yeah I really like this and then of course you can do stuff like ajust the turret to how you want it you can uh take the um directional light here and you can rotate it around if you're not satisfied with where the sun is shining and uh stuff like that but I actually think that um everything is in a pretty nice place already and that we don't need to do a lot to change this so next up is kind of adding some some UI elements to our scene and also I wanted to throw in here that we're currently using these graphics for turrets uh but I actually have uh some plans to maybe switch some of this stuff out with some more advanced Graphics down the line so that's going to be really exciting but for now we'll be using this guy and we can use pretty much anything for this because what we're going to do is we're going to take our standard turret and we're going to remove the turret script and we're also going to kind of um break this as a prefab uh connection so this is currently still linked to a prefab down here and we don't want it uh to um be linked that way because we want to U remove a firepoint we want to get rid of this component and so we'll just go under object and or game object and select break prefab instance and and now it's not connected in any way and so we can go ahead and delete the the firepoint and uh everything else uh can just be left as is so what we'll then do is uh go in um and I'll Place some UI stuff so let's go ahead and create a new canvas for this so let's go UI whoops not particle system UI and then just text that's going to create a new text object in this huge canvas and uh let's just make sure that this text object scales with our canvas and let's also set the font size to something like 80 and let's change the text here to say play then we can take our font and change that to robotto let's do robotto medium and let's change the color to white and we can maybe also add a bit of a shadow so let's just go Shadow here let's um turn that down a tiny bit and let's do two and 2 just to kind of give it a bit of an outline um so yeah all of the other settings we can pretty much leave as is except for one thing and that is currently our canvas is size to uh the uh size of our screen instead we want this to be wall space and remember we've done wall space canvases before and the thing about those is you of course have to adjust this to kind of fit the size of our text but we also have to go in here and adjust the scale because it's currently huge compared to a standard tur you can see here just how much we actually have to zoom out so what we'll do is go and find our scale here and put that at say 0.004 and I played around with this earlier and found that this was a value that worked pretty great so we're just going to at least begin with that let's put our position at zero and our Y at zero and that should place it inside of our turret so now we can just move this up and we can simply drag this um over if we want it to stay down here and I think actually we want one of our elements to be here maybe the quit button and then we can have play sit on top of the turret itself so let's take our play here now and rotate this by 90° and let's make sure that it sits pretty much on top of our turret which it looks like it does but it doesn't look too great from this angle so let's now move it down a bit and also drag it over uh to something like there uh it just looks nicer over in this view something like that cool and one we then need to do is of course turn this into a button so let's just rename the canvas here to something like top turret canvas and the text here to play button and currently this is only a text object so let's just add a new component button and the cool thing about adding a button component to a text object is that Unity will just go ahead and set everything up for you so uh right away and this is another thing we have to do we have to remove the camera controller on the camera so it doesn't snap to another location right away we should be able to click it and you can see that something happen so it's already turned into a button so all we really need to do now is just uh adjust some settings we can add an on click event which we'll create in a second but we can also maybe um change the animation here so currently we're just tining the color of the object what I want to do instead is utilize the fact that in the last video we created a much nicer hover animation uh by scaling the size of our UI so or a UI element so let's go and choose animation here and uh for navigation we want none and we could go ahead and autogenerate the animation and then go down into the animation tab here and edit them to create our own unique animation or we could just use the animation that we created in the last video so let's just go and hit add component add an animator and as the controller here we want to select the button controller that we previously created and remember the only special thing about this is that it has a a normal animation which has a scale of 111 a highlighted animation which has a scale of 1.05 and it actually also animates a tiny bit but you don't have to put that in there and then we have the Pressed which goes back to 111 and it's all that this is so now when we go in and hit play u we can see that it does this nice hover animation and when we click it it goes and becomes small very quickly cool so so um I believe that's all we really want to set up for on this object we could actually make make it a tiny bit bigger let's just try and see what happens should we just size up this canvas a tiny bit and um maybe increase the size of our text let's just try it out just for fun so let's take our text object here and increase the font size to say 100 and I actually like that a bit better because this is our play button and it's what we want our users to interact with right away I think it's okay to make this really really big so yeah something like that looks nice over here and that's the primary focus and then what we can do is um maybe duplicate this top turret canvas and we can then um rotate this by 0° really so we want to just snap that back and we can move it over here and I want this to be a lot uh smaller and o want to snap it over with an uh a z position of zero and uh I want this to say quit so this is going to be our uh Barrel canvas and it's going to just have a quit button whoops quit Buton and uh the font size here should be something like 80 actually we should make it less we should make it all the way down to say um 40 almost we don't want people to in check with this element and um we could put something like a robot light robotto light or even thin in here I think actually the thin works pretty well so let's just try that out and let's s back to 2D here and let's resize our canvas so we don't have this huge unnecessary canvas and we can move the entire thing over so that it sits on top of the barrel and then of course we'll have to put uh quit in here as the text and I think that already looks pretty decent I mean we can of course uh spend some time getting the positioning and feel of this uh exactly right but it should already be working and you can see that just the way that we set up our play to have this hover animation our quid Buon button does as well so really the only thing that's left is kind of hooking up these buttons to a script that will uh actually call or that has some functions that we can call from the buttons uh for playing the game which means transitioning to the main level scene or quitting which means just calling application. quit which will close down the build so um but actually what I want to do is also make this feel a bit more 3D because right now we could have really just hand painted this and I think we should re utilize the fact that we just built a 3D scene for our main menu and a way that we could do this is um by having the the turret here rotate um a little bit to uh kind of give the impression that it's aiming back and forth and this will uh of course we will have our UI elements follow the uh rotation of our turet I think that could look pretty cool also one thing that I might want to do is move our camera in a little closer but actually I kind of like that it's a bit distant so we'll just keep it this way for now so let's begin by hooking up our UI elements and then I'll show you I'll show you how we can do that rotation thing so um in order to uh kind of create some of the functionality around these buttons um what we could do is just create an empty object and reset the transform and I'm sorry for the noise here that's my cat playing around with um my water so um I will rename this to say main menu and we'll put that at the top and we'll just add a component here that is called main menu then let's double click this to open it up in uh visual studio and I'm just going to have a sip of water while we do that cool and um basically what I want to do is just create two very very simple public functions in here I want a public void called uh play and a public void a public void called um let's say whoops that's another cat stepping on the keyboard this is going crazy I should really lock those out of the room while do these videos they're pretty much in every single one I think it's a bit exciting for them uh so public void I'm going to call this one quit and uh basically what we'll do is um just throw a debug.log statement for now so we'll just say um play and we'll say um quit cool and then we'll go inside of unity and we'll find our top turret canvas which is our play button We'll add add an on click event so uh close all of this down and then under the button We'll add an on click event and we'll reference our main menu go down under the main menu script and call play and we'll do the exact same thing for our Barrel canvas so again here on the button add on click reference the menu go under the main menu script and call quit so now when we have play we should see in the console here that ignoring these uh Stupid errors when we hit play it says play and when we hit quit it says quit cool so all we really need to do now is just add a tiny bit of functionality so we'll be importing Unity engine. scene Management in order to load a new scene and we'll do that by going scene manager. load scene and then the um string or the name of that scene which is going to be main level but instead of hardcoding this in Let's uh make this editable inside the inspector so let's just create a public string which is going to be our level to load and we'll set that equal to main level by default and instead of putting in a string here we'll put level to load and in terms of quitting out of the application let's actually put a debug log statement in here saying something like exiting exitting and then we'll put in application. quit call that's all we need to do that is going to close down the application whether on Mac or on Windows it's going to just exit out and the reason why I'm putting exiting in here is because that's actually not visible in the inspector so or in the editor when we call application. quit in the editor absolutely nothing happens so it's just to let ourselves know that we pressed the quit button cool so now we can just go in here and we can hit play and we should see also under the main menu that we now have a level to load variable and we can hit quit and it's going to say exiting and we can hit play and it's going to transition to the next level where we can play awesome so that's really really easy and because we now have multiple levels in here what we want to do is go to file build settings and we want to make sure that we have our main level added here and that we also have our main menu and that our main menu is set up to uh be before the main level with a smaller build index that means that it will be loaded first so now when we start up the game if we were to build this we would see our main main menu and then we would use that trend parent them to that object just drag them in to make them Childs of that object and now when we rotate that the UI elements are rotating as well and you can create a script to control this you could have enemies go by and this one follow it that could be pretty fun or we could just go in here and create a very simple animation select the correct object the parts to rotate object hit create go on the animation and we'll call this one the turret menu um anim and all we really want to do here is have the first key frame kind of over here maybe we still want to be able to see and and click on our play button and then have the next animation which is going to be like 4 seconds in be around say here something around there and then again after 8 seconds we'll go back to this place there go so just copy the initial key frames and let's also smooth this out by going and selecting all of the key frames and selecting flat so now when we hit play whoops play from the beginning here you can see that we have this nice and slow aiming animation and it's enough that you can easily still click on the buttons but it just adds a bit of fun and interactivity into our main level or our main menu and really utilizes the fact that we are are uh we have have implemented this menu in 3D so that was pretty much all I wanted to show you this is the final result I hope you enjoyed this video let me know what you want to see next of course I have some ideas but still I could use more and uh yeah thanks for all of the kind feedback I'm really enjoying making these videos and without further Ado I will see you in the next one thanks to all the awesome patreon supporters who donated in October and special thanks to Sultan elative fa of marifi and James Kell Hound become a supporter at patreon.com reies
