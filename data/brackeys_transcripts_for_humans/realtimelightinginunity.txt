With timestamps:

00:00 - in a previous video we created this
00:01 - scene using the progressive light mapper
00:03 - now big lighting is great because it's
00:05 - very performant and allows for very
00:07 - detailed lighting but if you want your
00:09 - objects and lights to move around you of
00:11 - course need your lining to update to
00:13 - these changes luckily unity has a bunch
00:15 - of tools for creating real-time lighting
00:17 - so today we'll have a look at these
00:18 - tools and how to use them you can always
00:20 - jump to the timestamps on the screen now
00:22 - if there's any particular feature you're
00:23 - interested in this video is sponsored by
00:25 - the unity asset store and IBM IBM Watson
00:28 - unity SDK enables you to integrate
00:30 - powerful artificial intelligence in your
00:33 - unity applications with Watson Unity SDK
00:35 - now in the asset store you can configure
00:36 - games and projects to understand speech
00:39 - talk with users and understand the
00:41 - intent of a user in natural language the
00:43 - services include speech to text text to
00:45 - speech dialogue translation a natural
00:47 - language classification and are
00:49 - accessible directly within the Unity
00:50 - environment so get started simply
00:52 - download and try out the IBM Watson
00:54 - unity SDK for free on the asset store
00:56 - also check out the short series from IBM
00:58 - which provides an overview of all the
01:00 - core features of the Watson Unity SDK
01:02 - and with that let's get into the video
01:04 - so I've set up this example scene here
01:06 - and as you can see the lighting is
01:07 - currently very boring the colors are
01:10 - washed out there's only a single light
01:12 - in here and it's just using completely
01:14 - standard settings by the way if you want
01:16 - to get your hands on the same
01:18 - environment that I'm using you can
01:19 - simply download it off of dev assets all
01:22 - the assets are pay what you want and of
01:23 - course have a link to them in the
01:25 - description now before we start messing
01:27 - around with lights in our scene we want
01:29 - to make sure to set up all the
01:30 - appropriate settings
01:31 - the first one is configuring our color
01:33 - space to do this we go edit project
01:36 - settings and player and here we change
01:38 - the color space from gamma to linear as
01:41 - you can see right away this darkens our
01:43 - scene but it also adds way more color
01:45 - depth we also want to go to our camera
01:48 - and make sure we have allow HDR enabled
01:51 - for the rendering path we have two
01:53 - options for word and deferred I've
01:56 - talked about the rendering path HDR and
01:58 - the color space in another video on
02:00 - getting good graphics in unity so if you
02:03 - want to know what all this stuff means I
02:05 - definitely suggest checking out that
02:06 - video but for now just note that I
02:08 - expect to have a lot of real-time lights
02:10 - in my scene and whenever that's the case
02:12 - you're probably best off going
02:13 - deferred finally we can edit our quality
02:16 - settings by going edit project settings
02:18 - and selecting quality and the main thing
02:20 - that we want to do here is up the pixel
02:22 - light count this is basically a way to
02:24 - limit the amount of light calculations
02:26 - that we need to do so in order to
02:28 - display all the lights in our scene we
02:30 - definitely want to amp this up to say 20
02:32 - if you want you can also fine-tune the
02:34 - shadow quality but I'm just going to
02:36 - leave this at high resolution so now
02:38 - we've set up all the right settings but
02:40 - one more thing that I like to do before
02:42 - actually lining my scene is adding
02:44 - post-processing to my camera and that's
02:47 - because in order to utilize all the data
02:48 - captured by our camera whenever HDR is
02:51 - enabled we need to use a post-processing
02:53 - effect called the tone mapper again if
02:55 - you want to learn more about this stuff
02:57 - check out my video on good graphics in
02:58 - unity for now we can just go and open
03:00 - the asset store he will search for
03:02 - post-processing we'll want to select the
03:05 - post-processing stack and import it when
03:08 - you're done you should see a folder in
03:09 - your project called post-processing then
03:11 - we need to add a component to our main
03:13 - camera and the component is called
03:15 - post-processing behavior this will apply
03:17 - the effects to our camera and this takes
03:19 - in a post-processing profile this is
03:21 - basically just an object that stores all
03:23 - of our effect settings let's go to the
03:25 - project right click go create
03:27 - post-processing profile we'll call this
03:30 - CC for color correction we'll select our
03:32 - camera and drag in our CC object and now
03:35 - when we select it we can see all the
03:37 - different effects that we can now apply
03:38 - to our camera and the main one that I
03:40 - always make sure to check before adding
03:43 - lighting to my scene is color grading
03:45 - the reason why is that under the color
03:47 - grading you can see we have options for
03:49 - tone mapping and now here comes a matter
03:51 - of preference some people like to use
03:53 - the neutral tone mapper and then do all
03:56 - the color correction afterwards but I've
03:58 - recently been really fond of the filmic
04:00 - tone mapper as you can see really
04:02 - darkens our scene and adds a lot of
04:04 - contrast but in my opinion it also gives
04:07 - it this really cool filmic look just to
04:09 - make it a tiny bit brighter I'm also
04:11 - going to go to the post exposure and add
04:13 - 0.4 so now that we've set up our most
04:16 - basic color grading we're ready to start
04:18 - lighting our scene I'm gonna go window
04:20 - lighting and then settings and this is
04:23 - going to open up the lighting window as
04:25 - you can see we have a bunch of diff
04:27 - settings in here but we're actually
04:29 - going to ignore most of them we're only
04:31 - going to focus on the first two modules
04:33 - on the real-time lighting you just want
04:35 - to make sure to check real-time global
04:37 - illumination and under the environment
04:39 - we have a few settings that we can play
04:41 - around with the first one is the skybox
04:43 - material here we can of course change
04:45 - the skybox that surrounds our
04:47 - environment and the cool thing about
04:48 - unities real-time lighting solution is
04:50 - that unity will now automatically apply
04:53 - lining to our scene depending on the
04:55 - skybox that we have applied this is what
04:58 - we refer to as environment lighting as
05:00 - you can see the source is currently set
05:02 - to skybox and I have an intensity
05:04 - multiply here and you can see as I
05:06 - increase this just how much it makes our
05:08 - environment blend in with the skybox so
05:11 - whenever you're lighting an outdoor
05:13 - scene I really recommend spending a lot
05:15 - of time finding the right skybox you can
05:17 - always go to the asset store and search
05:19 - for skybox and there are actually a lot
05:22 - of really great ones here and many of
05:24 - these are actually free one that I
05:26 - really like is to free HDR sky now as
05:29 - you can see if I add this to my project
05:31 - switch to the scene view here and go and
05:34 - change the skybox material I'm just
05:36 - going to change to the skybox day this
05:38 - immediately impacts the lighting of our
05:41 - environment and if I switch to sunset
05:43 - you can clearly see how the intensity
05:46 - and color of the light changes but for
05:48 - now I'm just gonna switch back to the
05:50 - default skybox I'm gonna set the
05:52 - intensity multiplier to 1 and we can
05:54 - actually go in here and change from
05:55 - skybox to gradient this allows us to
05:58 - create our own custom lighting gradient
06:00 - from the sky color to the color around
06:03 - the equator and the ground or if you
06:06 - just want to apply a flat color you can
06:08 - do that as well whenever I'm lighting an
06:10 - indoor scene I always make sure to set
06:12 - the color to a complete blank but this
06:15 - scene is not indoors so I'm gonna change
06:16 - it back to Sky box and set the intensity
06:18 - to around - so now it's finally time to
06:22 - start adding actual light emitters into
06:24 - our scene I'm gonna get rid of my
06:26 - directional light here and show you how
06:28 - this is done
06:28 - try the light tourist scene with simply
06:30 - right click in the hierarchy go light
06:32 - and here we can select from three
06:33 - different real-time lights directional
06:35 - light point light and spotlight the
06:38 - directional light applies light from a
06:40 - given
06:41 - direction you can see if we add this to
06:42 - a scene it applies to all the objects
06:45 - within it it actually doesn't matter
06:47 - where it's placed the only thing that
06:49 - matters is how we rotate it as you can
06:52 - see right away there are no shadows we
06:54 - need to enable these manually so we'll
06:57 - go into the shadow type and here we can
06:59 - select either hard or soft shadows hard
07:01 - shadows of course always completely hide
07:04 - where soft shadows are kind of more
07:06 - realistically blurred out of it
07:08 - now we can position our direction of
07:10 - light where we want it to be
07:11 - I'd like it to kind of come from the
07:13 - left hand side here we can also change
07:16 - the color of a light I'm gonna make mine
07:18 - a tiny bit warmer by tinting it Orange
07:20 - as well as the intensity of the light
07:22 - one technique that I often like to apply
07:24 - when using directional light is what we
07:26 - refer to as two point lighting this is
07:28 - where we have a main light I'm gonna
07:30 - rename this to main light that is the
07:33 - main source of lighting in our scene
07:35 - this illuminates our subject from the
07:37 - front then a bit to one of these sides
07:39 - on top of the main light we also apply
07:41 - what is called a rim light I'm gonna
07:44 - rename this one to rim light and now
07:46 - this light comes from the back kind of
07:48 - pointing in the opposite direction of
07:50 - the main light now for this light we
07:52 - probably want to decrease the intensity
07:54 - a bit and what we often do is tint the
07:56 - rim light a blue tone again this helps
07:59 - it contrast with the main light
08:01 - currently this effect is very subtle but
08:03 - it's also supposed to be we can't go
08:06 - ahead and bump up the intensity a tiny
08:07 - bit though so now that we have our main
08:09 - directional lights in here it's time to
08:12 - make our scene feel more alive by adding
08:14 - point lights again we wanna right click
08:17 - in the hierarchy code light and select
08:19 - point light and just like directional
08:21 - lights emit light in a certain direction
08:22 - point lights emit light from a certain
08:25 - point so if we reset the transform on
08:28 - this and drag it into a visible part of
08:30 - our environment we can immediately see
08:32 - that it starts applying light to this
08:34 - part of the environment the intensity
08:36 - might be a bit too low here so we'll
08:38 - bump up the intensity to say 2 and we
08:40 - can also adjust the range of our light
08:43 - you can either do that by dragging on
08:45 - the sphere or changing it in the
08:47 - inspector I'm gonna set mine to around
08:48 - 20 so as you can see this immediately
08:50 - gives a very cool effect especially if
08:53 - we go in here and
08:54 - at shadows however if you have a lot of
08:57 - point lights in your scene having all of
08:58 - them rendered shadows can be quite
09:00 - performance intensive so I definitely
09:02 - recommend that you keep this at a
09:04 - minimum but for now I'm just gonna set
09:06 - this to hard shadows and as you can see
09:08 - this immediately looks super cool now
09:10 - I'm gonna go through the scene here and
09:12 - add a bunch of point lights with varying
09:14 - color I find that for fantasy
09:16 - environments like this one it's really
09:18 - important to play around with different
09:19 - vibrant colors so I'll see you in a bit
09:23 - [Music]
09:31 - so as you can see that helped quite a
09:34 - bit the scene feels way more interesting
09:37 - and less flat now I also think that we
09:39 - might have exaggerated the amount of
09:41 - light that we need from the directional
09:43 - lights so I'm gonna go into my main
09:45 - light here and decrease the intensity a
09:47 - bit I'd rather have the point light take
09:49 - over and make it feel like most of the
09:51 - light is coming from the environment
09:52 - itself now I don't think it's needed for
09:54 - this environment but we do have a third
09:56 - type of real-time light I'm of course
09:58 - talking about the spotlight the
10:00 - spotlight is fairly self-explanatory it
10:03 - allows you to create spotlights within
10:05 - the scene I found that I actually very
10:07 - rarely use this light but it can be
10:09 - really nice for highlighting certain
10:10 - parts of a scene or of course for
10:12 - creating stuff like flashlights say we
10:14 - wanted to really emphasize these two
10:16 - skeletons a way to do that would be put
10:19 - a spotlight right on top of them maybe
10:22 - move it a bit closer you can play with
10:24 - the range of the light here as well the
10:26 - spot angle and then increase the
10:28 - intensity and we can of course also add
10:30 - some shadows and as you can see it
10:32 - really helps our skeleton pop but for
10:34 - now I'm just going to delete it now the
10:36 - last type of light that I want to add is
10:39 - actually not a real-time light however
10:41 - I'll show you a few tricks for making it
10:43 - look like it is what I'm referring to is
10:45 - what we call emissive materials so I
10:48 - would really like this doorway to light
10:50 - up this way it could kind of act like a
10:52 - focal point for the scene but how do we
10:54 - do this using lights all the lights that
10:57 - we've seen so far to emit light onto the
10:59 - surroundings but they aren't actually
11:01 - visible themselves how do we create an
11:04 - actually visible light but to do that we
11:06 - first need to create the object
11:08 - for our light if you want to make a lamp
11:10 - you can go inside of blender or any
11:12 - other 3d modeling program and model out
11:14 - the lamp in our case we just want a flat
11:17 - doorway so I'm just gonna use a plane
11:19 - we'll right-click in the higher Kiko 3d
11:21 - object and select plane and it's gonna
11:23 - create a flat plane inside of the game
11:25 - I'm gonna rotate this by 90 degrees so
11:27 - it's pointing directly forward I'm also
11:29 - going to slice it down I place it in our
11:32 - doorframe
11:33 - once we're satisfied with the placement
11:34 - of our plane we want to go ahead and add
11:36 - an emissive material to it to view this
11:39 - we'll right click in the project go
11:40 - create material and we'll call this
11:42 - material glow we'll select the plane and
11:45 - drag our glow material onto it and now
11:47 - we can pretty much leave all the
11:49 - settings as is here the only thing that
11:51 - we want to do is go ahead and check
11:53 - emission here we can define a color for
11:55 - our mission I want to make this a light
11:57 - blue and I've actually prepared a color
11:59 - beforehand you can go ahead and copy it
12:01 - if you want to I also want to bump up
12:03 - the intensity of the emission which we
12:05 - control over here so I'm gonna set that
12:07 - to 5 and as you can see our object now
12:10 - looks very bright but it doesn't have
12:13 - that glow light effect and it's still
12:16 - not influencing the rest of our
12:17 - environment well for the first problem
12:19 - we can fix that using a post-processing
12:22 - effect so remember earlier when we added
12:24 - some color grading well we can actually
12:26 - go in here and add some glow as well we
12:30 - refer to this setting as bloom and as
12:32 - you can see right away when I check it
12:34 - there's really no doubt that it's
12:36 - working we can go in here and we can
12:38 - adjust the threshold this is how bright
12:40 - something needs to be in order for us to
12:42 - apply a glow to it I'm just gonna set
12:44 - this to something like 2 then we can
12:46 - also adjust the intensity as well as the
12:48 - radius of the glow now I don't want this
12:51 - to take over the entire scene but I
12:52 - definitely want it to be there so that
12:54 - was pretty easy but it's still not
12:56 - really applying light to the rest of our
12:59 - environment and the reason why is that
13:00 - unity won't actually apply light from
13:03 - emissive materials in real time you need
13:05 - to bake your scene in order for this to
13:07 - happen but we can fake it to do this I'm
13:11 - simply going to use a few point lights
13:13 - so let's take one of the point lights
13:14 - from our scene and duplicate it let's
13:16 - move it close to the doorway and let's
13:19 - simply tend it in the light blue color
13:22 - you can see right away it looks like the
13:24 - light is actually coming from the door
13:26 - it's that easy no one is ever going to
13:29 - notice that we're actually using a point
13:31 - light to do this and you don't even
13:33 - necessarily need to put it right on top
13:35 - of the door of course this might give
13:37 - really nice shadows but I like it more
13:39 - out here why it's actually lighting up a
13:41 - larger part of the scene so once we're
13:44 - satisfied with all the lights I'm gonna
13:45 - right click in the Harkey hit create
13:47 - empty object and I'm gonna rename this
13:49 - to lights and then I'm gonna select all
13:51 - my lights and drag them in there and
13:53 - I've actually placed my environment on a
13:56 - turntable so if I go ahead and hit play
13:59 - the entire environment is going to
14:01 - rotate now of course we want our lights
14:03 - to rotate with it so I'm just gonna take
14:05 - my lights here and parent them to the
14:08 - turntable and now we can see our entire
14:10 - scene rotating and updating in real time
14:13 - and the final thing that I always add to
14:15 - my scenes which are lighted in real time
14:18 - is a third post-processing effect now
14:21 - this one is a nice one let's select our
14:24 - CC layer and let's go to the top and
14:26 - check ambient occlusion and right away
14:29 - this might not do much but we can play
14:31 - around with the radius and the intensity
14:34 - in order to really help at detail to our
14:37 - lighting ambient occlusion is basically
14:40 - just the shattering that happens when
14:42 - two surfaces meet you can see this if I
14:44 - enable and disable it that every time we
14:47 - have a sharp angle between some surfaces
14:50 - ambient occlusion gets applied of course
14:53 - play around with this effect to make it
14:54 - suit your scene but I definitely
14:56 - recommend adding it that's pretty much
14:58 - all of my real-time lighting tips for
15:00 - unity from here recommend you to play
15:02 - around with different lighting setups
15:04 - different lighting settings
15:05 - post-processing effects and of course
15:07 - trying to tweak these settings to make
15:09 - everything as performant as possible and
15:11 - of course make sure to have fun that's

Cleaned transcript:

in a previous video we created this scene using the progressive light mapper now big lighting is great because it's very performant and allows for very detailed lighting but if you want your objects and lights to move around you of course need your lining to update to these changes luckily unity has a bunch of tools for creating realtime lighting so today we'll have a look at these tools and how to use them you can always jump to the timestamps on the screen now if there's any particular feature you're interested in this video is sponsored by the unity asset store and IBM IBM Watson unity SDK enables you to integrate powerful artificial intelligence in your unity applications with Watson Unity SDK now in the asset store you can configure games and projects to understand speech talk with users and understand the intent of a user in natural language the services include speech to text text to speech dialogue translation a natural language classification and are accessible directly within the Unity environment so get started simply download and try out the IBM Watson unity SDK for free on the asset store also check out the short series from IBM which provides an overview of all the core features of the Watson Unity SDK and with that let's get into the video so I've set up this example scene here and as you can see the lighting is currently very boring the colors are washed out there's only a single light in here and it's just using completely standard settings by the way if you want to get your hands on the same environment that I'm using you can simply download it off of dev assets all the assets are pay what you want and of course have a link to them in the description now before we start messing around with lights in our scene we want to make sure to set up all the appropriate settings the first one is configuring our color space to do this we go edit project settings and player and here we change the color space from gamma to linear as you can see right away this darkens our scene but it also adds way more color depth we also want to go to our camera and make sure we have allow HDR enabled for the rendering path we have two options for word and deferred I've talked about the rendering path HDR and the color space in another video on getting good graphics in unity so if you want to know what all this stuff means I definitely suggest checking out that video but for now just note that I expect to have a lot of realtime lights in my scene and whenever that's the case you're probably best off going deferred finally we can edit our quality settings by going edit project settings and selecting quality and the main thing that we want to do here is up the pixel light count this is basically a way to limit the amount of light calculations that we need to do so in order to display all the lights in our scene we definitely want to amp this up to say 20 if you want you can also finetune the shadow quality but I'm just going to leave this at high resolution so now we've set up all the right settings but one more thing that I like to do before actually lining my scene is adding postprocessing to my camera and that's because in order to utilize all the data captured by our camera whenever HDR is enabled we need to use a postprocessing effect called the tone mapper again if you want to learn more about this stuff check out my video on good graphics in unity for now we can just go and open the asset store he will search for postprocessing we'll want to select the postprocessing stack and import it when you're done you should see a folder in your project called postprocessing then we need to add a component to our main camera and the component is called postprocessing behavior this will apply the effects to our camera and this takes in a postprocessing profile this is basically just an object that stores all of our effect settings let's go to the project right click go create postprocessing profile we'll call this CC for color correction we'll select our camera and drag in our CC object and now when we select it we can see all the different effects that we can now apply to our camera and the main one that I always make sure to check before adding lighting to my scene is color grading the reason why is that under the color grading you can see we have options for tone mapping and now here comes a matter of preference some people like to use the neutral tone mapper and then do all the color correction afterwards but I've recently been really fond of the filmic tone mapper as you can see really darkens our scene and adds a lot of contrast but in my opinion it also gives it this really cool filmic look just to make it a tiny bit brighter I'm also going to go to the post exposure and add 0.4 so now that we've set up our most basic color grading we're ready to start lighting our scene I'm gonna go window lighting and then settings and this is going to open up the lighting window as you can see we have a bunch of diff settings in here but we're actually going to ignore most of them we're only going to focus on the first two modules on the realtime lighting you just want to make sure to check realtime global illumination and under the environment we have a few settings that we can play around with the first one is the skybox material here we can of course change the skybox that surrounds our environment and the cool thing about unities realtime lighting solution is that unity will now automatically apply lining to our scene depending on the skybox that we have applied this is what we refer to as environment lighting as you can see the source is currently set to skybox and I have an intensity multiply here and you can see as I increase this just how much it makes our environment blend in with the skybox so whenever you're lighting an outdoor scene I really recommend spending a lot of time finding the right skybox you can always go to the asset store and search for skybox and there are actually a lot of really great ones here and many of these are actually free one that I really like is to free HDR sky now as you can see if I add this to my project switch to the scene view here and go and change the skybox material I'm just going to change to the skybox day this immediately impacts the lighting of our environment and if I switch to sunset you can clearly see how the intensity and color of the light changes but for now I'm just gonna switch back to the default skybox I'm gonna set the intensity multiplier to 1 and we can actually go in here and change from skybox to gradient this allows us to create our own custom lighting gradient from the sky color to the color around the equator and the ground or if you just want to apply a flat color you can do that as well whenever I'm lighting an indoor scene I always make sure to set the color to a complete blank but this scene is not indoors so I'm gonna change it back to Sky box and set the intensity to around so now it's finally time to start adding actual light emitters into our scene I'm gonna get rid of my directional light here and show you how this is done try the light tourist scene with simply right click in the hierarchy go light and here we can select from three different realtime lights directional light point light and spotlight the directional light applies light from a given direction you can see if we add this to a scene it applies to all the objects within it it actually doesn't matter where it's placed the only thing that matters is how we rotate it as you can see right away there are no shadows we need to enable these manually so we'll go into the shadow type and here we can select either hard or soft shadows hard shadows of course always completely hide where soft shadows are kind of more realistically blurred out of it now we can position our direction of light where we want it to be I'd like it to kind of come from the left hand side here we can also change the color of a light I'm gonna make mine a tiny bit warmer by tinting it Orange as well as the intensity of the light one technique that I often like to apply when using directional light is what we refer to as two point lighting this is where we have a main light I'm gonna rename this to main light that is the main source of lighting in our scene this illuminates our subject from the front then a bit to one of these sides on top of the main light we also apply what is called a rim light I'm gonna rename this one to rim light and now this light comes from the back kind of pointing in the opposite direction of the main light now for this light we probably want to decrease the intensity a bit and what we often do is tint the rim light a blue tone again this helps it contrast with the main light currently this effect is very subtle but it's also supposed to be we can't go ahead and bump up the intensity a tiny bit though so now that we have our main directional lights in here it's time to make our scene feel more alive by adding point lights again we wanna right click in the hierarchy code light and select point light and just like directional lights emit light in a certain direction point lights emit light from a certain point so if we reset the transform on this and drag it into a visible part of our environment we can immediately see that it starts applying light to this part of the environment the intensity might be a bit too low here so we'll bump up the intensity to say 2 and we can also adjust the range of our light you can either do that by dragging on the sphere or changing it in the inspector I'm gonna set mine to around 20 so as you can see this immediately gives a very cool effect especially if we go in here and at shadows however if you have a lot of point lights in your scene having all of them rendered shadows can be quite performance intensive so I definitely recommend that you keep this at a minimum but for now I'm just gonna set this to hard shadows and as you can see this immediately looks super cool now I'm gonna go through the scene here and add a bunch of point lights with varying color I find that for fantasy environments like this one it's really important to play around with different vibrant colors so I'll see you in a bit so as you can see that helped quite a bit the scene feels way more interesting and less flat now I also think that we might have exaggerated the amount of light that we need from the directional lights so I'm gonna go into my main light here and decrease the intensity a bit I'd rather have the point light take over and make it feel like most of the light is coming from the environment itself now I don't think it's needed for this environment but we do have a third type of realtime light I'm of course talking about the spotlight the spotlight is fairly selfexplanatory it allows you to create spotlights within the scene I found that I actually very rarely use this light but it can be really nice for highlighting certain parts of a scene or of course for creating stuff like flashlights say we wanted to really emphasize these two skeletons a way to do that would be put a spotlight right on top of them maybe move it a bit closer you can play with the range of the light here as well the spot angle and then increase the intensity and we can of course also add some shadows and as you can see it really helps our skeleton pop but for now I'm just going to delete it now the last type of light that I want to add is actually not a realtime light however I'll show you a few tricks for making it look like it is what I'm referring to is what we call emissive materials so I would really like this doorway to light up this way it could kind of act like a focal point for the scene but how do we do this using lights all the lights that we've seen so far to emit light onto the surroundings but they aren't actually visible themselves how do we create an actually visible light but to do that we first need to create the object for our light if you want to make a lamp you can go inside of blender or any other 3d modeling program and model out the lamp in our case we just want a flat doorway so I'm just gonna use a plane we'll rightclick in the higher Kiko 3d object and select plane and it's gonna create a flat plane inside of the game I'm gonna rotate this by 90 degrees so it's pointing directly forward I'm also going to slice it down I place it in our doorframe once we're satisfied with the placement of our plane we want to go ahead and add an emissive material to it to view this we'll right click in the project go create material and we'll call this material glow we'll select the plane and drag our glow material onto it and now we can pretty much leave all the settings as is here the only thing that we want to do is go ahead and check emission here we can define a color for our mission I want to make this a light blue and I've actually prepared a color beforehand you can go ahead and copy it if you want to I also want to bump up the intensity of the emission which we control over here so I'm gonna set that to 5 and as you can see our object now looks very bright but it doesn't have that glow light effect and it's still not influencing the rest of our environment well for the first problem we can fix that using a postprocessing effect so remember earlier when we added some color grading well we can actually go in here and add some glow as well we refer to this setting as bloom and as you can see right away when I check it there's really no doubt that it's working we can go in here and we can adjust the threshold this is how bright something needs to be in order for us to apply a glow to it I'm just gonna set this to something like 2 then we can also adjust the intensity as well as the radius of the glow now I don't want this to take over the entire scene but I definitely want it to be there so that was pretty easy but it's still not really applying light to the rest of our environment and the reason why is that unity won't actually apply light from emissive materials in real time you need to bake your scene in order for this to happen but we can fake it to do this I'm simply going to use a few point lights so let's take one of the point lights from our scene and duplicate it let's move it close to the doorway and let's simply tend it in the light blue color you can see right away it looks like the light is actually coming from the door it's that easy no one is ever going to notice that we're actually using a point light to do this and you don't even necessarily need to put it right on top of the door of course this might give really nice shadows but I like it more out here why it's actually lighting up a larger part of the scene so once we're satisfied with all the lights I'm gonna right click in the Harkey hit create empty object and I'm gonna rename this to lights and then I'm gonna select all my lights and drag them in there and I've actually placed my environment on a turntable so if I go ahead and hit play the entire environment is going to rotate now of course we want our lights to rotate with it so I'm just gonna take my lights here and parent them to the turntable and now we can see our entire scene rotating and updating in real time and the final thing that I always add to my scenes which are lighted in real time is a third postprocessing effect now this one is a nice one let's select our CC layer and let's go to the top and check ambient occlusion and right away this might not do much but we can play around with the radius and the intensity in order to really help at detail to our lighting ambient occlusion is basically just the shattering that happens when two surfaces meet you can see this if I enable and disable it that every time we have a sharp angle between some surfaces ambient occlusion gets applied of course play around with this effect to make it suit your scene but I definitely recommend adding it that's pretty much all of my realtime lighting tips for unity from here recommend you to play around with different lighting setups different lighting settings postprocessing effects and of course trying to tweak these settings to make everything as performant as possible and of course make sure to have fun that's pretty much it for this video make
