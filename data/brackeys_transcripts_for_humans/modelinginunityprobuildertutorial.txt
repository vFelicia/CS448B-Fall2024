00:00 - so pro builder has been acquired by
00:01 - unity and it's now free for everyone to
00:03 - use
00:03 - prova there is an amazing tool for
00:05 - quickly modeling assets and levels
00:07 - within the unity editor and I personally
00:09 - think it's really great for prototyping
00:11 - you can make some incredibly beautiful
00:13 - things using pro builder
00:15 - well I can't what other people can and
00:21 - let's no doubt it's a really useful tool
00:23 - so let's jump right into it also special
00:25 - thanks to Patrick McKinney Diego
00:27 - infinity PBR and your I Omar for their
00:29 - support on patreon so before we can
00:31 - start using pro builder we need to
00:33 - include it in our project as of
00:34 - recording this video the pro builder
00:36 - tools aren't part of unity by default
00:38 - instead we have to go to the asset store
00:40 - to download it I'll of course have a
00:42 - link for this in the description once
00:44 - it's downloaded you should see a pro
00:46 - core folder in your project now we can
00:48 - go to the top under tools go under Pro
00:50 - builder and let's open up the pro
00:52 - builder window and this is going to open
00:54 - up a new window with a bunch of icons if
00:57 - we right-click on the blank space here
00:59 - we can choose between icon mode or text
01:01 - mode this is really just a matter of
01:03 - preference
01:04 - I often switch between them when I'm
01:06 - looking for a particular setting but
01:08 - most of the time I spend in icon mode
01:10 - now I'm using Pro builder together with
01:12 - pro grids to easily snap everything to
01:15 - the grid and that's also why you seen
01:16 - the green gridlines here it's totally
01:18 - optional but if you want to set that up
01:20 - as well I suggest you check out our
01:21 - video on programs and now we're pretty
01:23 - much ready to get started
01:25 - so the first tool that I want to show is
01:26 - the polygon shape tool if we click this
01:29 - we can quickly draw out a shape I'm
01:31 - certainly gonna press my mouse button in
01:33 - order to insert some points and I'll
01:35 - draw out a nice space for our level here
01:38 - once you're satisfied simply close out
01:39 - the shape and we then use our mouse to
01:41 - control the height of the extrusion I
01:43 - think about two units seems fine we can
01:46 - always go in and adjust afterwards and
01:49 - once you're happy hit enter this
01:51 - completes our shape and it's now an
01:52 - object that we can move around the scene
01:54 - so that's how you can easily get started
01:56 - with creating objects in Pro builder but
01:59 - pro builder is also great for modifying
02:01 - objects after the fact at the very top
02:03 - here we have four different icons these
02:05 - are basically our selection modes
02:07 - currently we're in object mode so we
02:09 - select an entire object at a time we can
02:12 - also switch to vertex
02:13 - selection this allows us to select
02:15 - individual vertices and you'll notice
02:17 - that we can easily move these around
02:19 - using the default unity move tool I'm
02:21 - just gonna undo that we also have a
02:23 - selection move for edges these are the
02:25 - lines that connect between vertices as
02:27 - well as faces beside these surfaces that
02:30 - fill out our geometry so in my case here
02:33 - I'm gonna select the face at the bottom
02:35 - I'm then gonna switch to the scale tool
02:37 - by hitting R and if I just go ahead and
02:39 - scale this up you can see what happens
02:41 - it kind of stretches out our model this
02:43 - is fine in some cases but what I want is
02:45 - to create some extra geometry underneath
02:47 - our current platform to do that I hold
02:49 - down shift and then scale and you can
02:51 - see that we are now creating an extra
02:53 - surface underneath we then choose the
02:55 - right size for this and then gonna
02:57 - switch to the move tool and again I'm
02:59 - gonna hold down shift and move in order
03:02 - to extrude out the surface I'm gonna
03:04 - make this two units wide as well again
03:07 - I'm gonna switch to the scale tool hold
03:09 - down shift and extrude inwards in order
03:12 - to kind of form a pillar and don't worry
03:14 - about the glitching here that's just
03:15 - because the lighting is currently
03:17 - calculating and finally I'm gonna switch
03:19 - back to the move tool hold down shift
03:21 - and move it down in order to extrude out
03:23 - a pillar so now we kind of have a
03:25 - platform standing on top of a pillar and
03:28 - it's kind of resembling a watch tower if
03:31 - we want it we could easily go in here
03:32 - and add extra detail for example we
03:35 - could switch to at selection and in
03:37 - order to quick select the entire ring
03:38 - that goes around our pillar we can
03:41 - simply double click and now we could try
03:43 - moving this down a little I think that
03:45 - looks pretty cool in order to better see
03:47 - what we're looking at I'm just gonna
03:48 - take our directional light and just
03:51 - decrease the intensity to something like
03:52 - point eight now depending on what mode
03:54 - we're currently in and what we have
03:56 - selected we're going to see different
03:57 - icons in our pro builder window and you
04:00 - might find that these are pretty
04:01 - overwhelming in the beginning luckily
04:03 - they are color-coded in order to make it
04:05 - easier to find the setting you're
04:07 - looking for if we select the top face of
04:09 - our model here we can use all the red
04:12 - icons in order to change the geometry
04:14 - say we wanted to add a bevel we'd click
04:17 - the icon right here and voila we've now
04:20 - created a bevel all the way around our
04:22 - surface right next to the bevel we have
04:24 - a button that will subdivide the surface
04:26 - we can also flip the face
04:27 - normal as well as detached faces all the
04:30 - tools that are marked with blue have to
04:32 - do with selection the ones that I use
04:34 - the most here is the ability to grow and
04:36 - shrink your selection this is the gross
04:39 - selection button and this shrink
04:41 - selection button lets switch into object
04:44 - mode and here we can use all the green
04:46 - buttons to affect our entire object we
04:49 - could for example mirror objects and
04:51 - notice that this is one of the settings
04:52 - that has a little cog here which means
04:55 - that we can change some options on the
04:57 - setting by simply holding down alt and
04:59 - clicking and here we could for example
05:01 - change what access we want to mirror on
05:03 - I'm just gonna delete that
05:05 - another handy setting is that we can
05:07 - actually take our model and export it
05:09 - using this button right here if you hold
05:12 - down alt we get to choose what format we
05:15 - want and a bunch of other settings this
05:17 - is super useful for great boxing and
05:19 - prototyping a level because you can lay
05:21 - out your level and see if it place nice
05:23 - and once you're satisfied you can take
05:25 - your pro builder level and bring it into
05:27 - an actual 3d modeling software and there
05:29 - you can replace objects and add detail
05:31 - to make it look much better and then
05:33 - simply bring it back into unity and
05:35 - finally the orange color at the top is
05:38 - for all of the editors this is where we
05:40 - created our new polygon shape and that's
05:42 - actually another way to create objects
05:44 - which is really powerful and that's
05:47 - using this shape generator it's the
05:49 - first button in the top left and if we
05:51 - click this we now get a new window as
05:53 - well as a preview of the object that
05:55 - we're currently generating I'm just
05:57 - gonna go and move up our preview here so
05:59 - we can actually see it and this allows
06:01 - us to easily generate a bunch of
06:03 - different shapes if we go to the shape
06:05 - selector we can change from cube to
06:07 - prism their options for doors pipes
06:11 - cones arches and one that I use all the
06:16 - time which is extremely useful is it has
06:19 - a stayer generator this tool is just
06:22 - amazing I want to go ahead and get rid
06:24 - of the curvature so I'm gonna set that
06:26 - to zero I'm also going to move it over
06:29 - and move it down a bit I'm gonna rotate
06:31 - it by about 90 degrees and so it's
06:34 - nicely centered I'm gonna leave the
06:36 - width at around to that set the height
06:38 - to two as well and I think actually does
06:41 - the
06:41 - we'll be fine and around too as well if
06:44 - we want to adjust the amount of steps we
06:46 - can simply change that here I think I'm
06:48 - gonna add in a few more steps here once
06:50 - you're satisfied with all of your
06:51 - options simply hit build pro builder
06:54 - generates the object and it's now like
06:56 - any other that we can see in our scene
06:58 - if we go and close this window we can
07:00 - maybe add a tiny bit more geometry to
07:03 - our level I'm gonna open up the polygon
07:05 - shape tool and I'm just quickly gonna
07:07 - draw something out I definitely like the
07:09 - look of that so I'm gonna go ahead and
07:11 - create another stair for this I'm gonna
07:13 - select the stair tool I'm gonna move up
07:15 - the stair place it where I want it and
07:17 - this one I want to add curvature to so
07:20 - I'm gonna set the curvature to around 90
07:22 - I'm gonna rotate it move it over let's
07:25 - change the height to one and I actually
07:28 - think that looks pretty nice and then
07:30 - I'm gonna hit build stair and I hope
07:32 - that you're starting to see just how
07:33 - easy it is to quickly create levels with
07:36 - this tall now once we're satisfied with
07:38 - our model its of course nice to be able
07:40 - to add some colors and materials to it
07:43 - to do that let's open up the material
07:45 - editor here we can drag in all the
07:47 - materials that we want to be able to
07:49 - apply to our models this of course the
07:51 - default prototype one which is the one
07:53 - that's currently applied I've also
07:54 - created two materials beforehand a blue
07:57 - material and a red material and if you
08:00 - want to create your own simply right
08:01 - click go create material we can call
08:04 - this one green material and you can
08:07 - pretty much use any settings that you'd
08:09 - like here probably also have some
08:11 - shaders that you can use the default
08:13 - shader simply use the standard vertex
08:15 - color you can choose a texture I'm just
08:18 - gonna go with the default grid box here
08:20 - and we can maybe tinted a green color
08:22 - and now we can simply drag it into the
08:24 - material editor just like all the others
08:26 - then to apply a material to one of our
08:28 - objects we simply select it so I'm gonna
08:30 - select the topmost object here and you
08:33 - can see the shortcuts that are mapped to
08:35 - the different materials right here so in
08:37 - my case I'm gonna press alt for in order
08:39 - to apply the green material and there we
08:41 - go for the stairs here I'm gonna add a
08:44 - blue material and if we only want to add
08:46 - colors to a certain part of an object
08:49 - well then we simply select the object we
08:51 - go into face mode and I'm gonna select
08:54 - all the faces around
08:55 - the edge of this tower here and then we
08:57 - simply press the material that we want
08:59 - so I'm gonna select a red material for
09:01 - this one and there we go
09:04 - now I'm just using simple colors to
09:05 - illustrate the concept here but you can
09:07 - add as much detail as you want to your
09:09 - materials if you want to use metallic
09:11 - maps and normal maps and height maps you
09:13 - can simply use the standard shader also
09:15 - sometimes it's nice to be able to
09:16 - manually edit you reads on an object
09:19 - luckily pro builder actually comes with
09:21 - a UV editor as well let's select our top
09:24 - object here and hit F to focus on it we
09:27 - then open up the UV editor here this is
09:29 - a nother window and here we can actually
09:31 - see the UVs that make up our object say
09:35 - we wanted to change the UVs on the top
09:37 - surface here well we can simply move it
09:39 - over scale it up and rotate it just as
09:43 - you would in the normal unity editor in
09:46 - fact if you wanted to create a custom
09:48 - texture specifically for this object we
09:50 - can press the small camera button here
09:52 - in order to render out or you v's so
09:55 - that we can paint on top of them in our
09:56 - texturing software pretty cool oh and
09:59 - did I mention that right away our
10:01 - objects should actually already have
10:03 - colliders I'm just gonna add a quick
10:05 - rigidbody to our scene here and if I now
10:08 - hit play we can see that the ball
10:10 - collides with our environment yay that's
10:15 - pretty much it for this video on pro
10:16 - builder I expect a lot of these features
10:18 - and you want to go through some changes
10:20 - now that it's part of the unity
10:21 - ecosystem so stay tuned for that
10:23 - also I'm pleased to announce that we now
10:25 - have an official breakfast discord
10:27 - server it was created by some awesome

Cleaned transcript:

so pro builder has been acquired by unity and it's now free for everyone to use prova there is an amazing tool for quickly modeling assets and levels within the unity editor and I personally think it's really great for prototyping you can make some incredibly beautiful things using pro builder well I can't what other people can and let's no doubt it's a really useful tool so let's jump right into it also special thanks to Patrick McKinney Diego infinity PBR and your I Omar for their support on patreon so before we can start using pro builder we need to include it in our project as of recording this video the pro builder tools aren't part of unity by default instead we have to go to the asset store to download it I'll of course have a link for this in the description once it's downloaded you should see a pro core folder in your project now we can go to the top under tools go under Pro builder and let's open up the pro builder window and this is going to open up a new window with a bunch of icons if we rightclick on the blank space here we can choose between icon mode or text mode this is really just a matter of preference I often switch between them when I'm looking for a particular setting but most of the time I spend in icon mode now I'm using Pro builder together with pro grids to easily snap everything to the grid and that's also why you seen the green gridlines here it's totally optional but if you want to set that up as well I suggest you check out our video on programs and now we're pretty much ready to get started so the first tool that I want to show is the polygon shape tool if we click this we can quickly draw out a shape I'm certainly gonna press my mouse button in order to insert some points and I'll draw out a nice space for our level here once you're satisfied simply close out the shape and we then use our mouse to control the height of the extrusion I think about two units seems fine we can always go in and adjust afterwards and once you're happy hit enter this completes our shape and it's now an object that we can move around the scene so that's how you can easily get started with creating objects in Pro builder but pro builder is also great for modifying objects after the fact at the very top here we have four different icons these are basically our selection modes currently we're in object mode so we select an entire object at a time we can also switch to vertex selection this allows us to select individual vertices and you'll notice that we can easily move these around using the default unity move tool I'm just gonna undo that we also have a selection move for edges these are the lines that connect between vertices as well as faces beside these surfaces that fill out our geometry so in my case here I'm gonna select the face at the bottom I'm then gonna switch to the scale tool by hitting R and if I just go ahead and scale this up you can see what happens it kind of stretches out our model this is fine in some cases but what I want is to create some extra geometry underneath our current platform to do that I hold down shift and then scale and you can see that we are now creating an extra surface underneath we then choose the right size for this and then gonna switch to the move tool and again I'm gonna hold down shift and move in order to extrude out the surface I'm gonna make this two units wide as well again I'm gonna switch to the scale tool hold down shift and extrude inwards in order to kind of form a pillar and don't worry about the glitching here that's just because the lighting is currently calculating and finally I'm gonna switch back to the move tool hold down shift and move it down in order to extrude out a pillar so now we kind of have a platform standing on top of a pillar and it's kind of resembling a watch tower if we want it we could easily go in here and add extra detail for example we could switch to at selection and in order to quick select the entire ring that goes around our pillar we can simply double click and now we could try moving this down a little I think that looks pretty cool in order to better see what we're looking at I'm just gonna take our directional light and just decrease the intensity to something like point eight now depending on what mode we're currently in and what we have selected we're going to see different icons in our pro builder window and you might find that these are pretty overwhelming in the beginning luckily they are colorcoded in order to make it easier to find the setting you're looking for if we select the top

nice to be able to add some colors and materials to it to do that let's open up the material editor here we can drag in all the materials that we want to be able to apply to our models this of course the default prototype one which is the one that's currently applied I've also created two materials beforehand a blue material and a red material and if you want to create your own simply right click go create material we can call this one green material and you can pretty much use any settings that you'd like here probably also have some shaders that you can use the default shader simply use the standard vertex color you can choose a texture I'm just gonna go with the default grid box here and we can maybe tinted a green color and now we can simply drag it into the material editor just like
