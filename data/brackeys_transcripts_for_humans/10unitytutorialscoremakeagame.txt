00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - video number 10 in make a game a cool
00:08 - series on making a video game in unity
00:11 - so today we are going to be U making the
00:14 - score system uh for our players so every
00:18 - time we pick up a coin we are going to
00:20 - see some DUI on the screen it's not
00:23 - going to be fancy but it's going to be
00:24 - there that will display the score so
00:27 - let's just go ahead and dig right into
00:29 - it so as always I've opened up
00:32 - unity and uh what we're going to do now
00:35 - is we're going to first off select our
00:38 - coin and uh now you know what let's uh
00:41 - there because there are two parts to
00:43 - this process the first is uh of course
00:47 - the coin we have to uh to actually
00:50 - change a variable um but it's a good
00:53 - idea to stall this variable not on the
00:55 - coin itself because we will have
00:58 - multiple coins spread out the entire
01:01 - scene and so instead we could just make
01:04 - an uh Master game object that will have
01:08 - this variable and that will also take
01:10 - care of the dii uh and then we can just
01:13 - access that variable and change that so
01:16 - that's what we're going to do so first
01:19 - off let's make this master object so
01:22 - let's go under game object and hit
01:24 - create empty or press control shift and
01:27 - that's of course command shift n if
01:29 - you're on a Mac
01:30 - and let's go ahead and call this
01:32 - underscore GM and again the reason why I
01:35 - put an underscore is so that it will
01:37 - stay on top of the
01:40 - hierarchy let's just position all of
01:42 - this uh by 0000 Z that's just general
01:46 - good practice and let's go ahead and add
01:48 - a new component new script of type
01:51 - JavaScript and let's call this game uh
01:57 - Master hit create an ad and let's double
02:00 - click it to open it up in mono
02:05 - develop there we go oops this is just
02:09 - some of our previous script so if I zoom
02:11 - in on this we can go ahead and get
02:13 - started so first off we of course want a
02:17 - variable and this variable is going to
02:19 - be
02:21 - VAR uh and then we're going to call it
02:24 - uh current score um it's I'm just going
02:28 - to call it this because we might also
02:30 - want like a high score a master score
02:33 - okay let's call this a current score
02:36 - like this and let's going make this
02:40 - equal to first off it's an integer and
02:43 - let's make it equal to zero by default
02:47 - and uh what we can go ahead and do is we
02:49 - can make this into a variable we can
02:51 - access from other scripts and we do this
02:54 - by typing static in front of VAR so it's
02:58 - a static variable meaning that we can
03:00 - access it from all
03:03 - scripts uh cool so that's basically all
03:05 - we're going to do in here uh what we
03:08 - would do next is we are going to change
03:09 - this function to on GUI because every uh
03:14 - guy element is made in the on GUI
03:16 - function but I'm going to go ahead and
03:18 - talk about the uh guy system in a sec
03:22 - first off let's just make this variable
03:24 - actually change so uh you will notice
03:28 - that we can't see see this in the
03:31 - inspector so what we can just simply do
03:34 - is um go ahead and make a function uh
03:38 - that will uh allow us to see it in the
03:40 - inspector because static variables are
03:44 - invisible and we would like to just know
03:46 - if it's changing so to easily display it
03:50 - let's just make a normal variable that
03:52 - will that will be shown in the inspector
03:54 - and make it equal to the current Spore
03:57 - uh variable so let's just call this
04:00 - uh test and make it default to zero and
04:04 - then in the function update we'll just
04:06 - say test equals current score and round
04:10 - it off and now we should see a variable
04:13 - here that is zero by default try
04:17 - again uh wait for it to pop up we should
04:22 - see it in just a sec it's having trouble
04:25 - showing H and I can't select other
04:28 - objects it looks like I might need to
04:32 - quickly restart Unity because something
04:34 - has gone horribly wrong with the
04:36 - inspector here let's just yeah I'm just
04:41 - quickly going to reopen up
04:44 - Unity so give this a reboot I'm sorry
04:48 - but if this is enough I
04:51 - it's I don't want to cut it out so let's
04:55 - see if it's working now and select our
04:57 - GM and there it was so so we have the
05:00 - variable now uh I don't know why it
05:02 - acted so weird uh and I don't know why I
05:05 - can't dock it over here as I wanted to
05:09 - we can go under the layout and just uh
05:11 - select default great so now that
05:14 - everything is back to normal let's just
05:17 - go ahead and see uh what this variable
05:20 - does right now it simply stays zero no
05:23 - matter what we do because we need to
05:25 - find our coin and double click the coin
05:27 - pickup script and in here we need to
05:29 - change the
05:31 - score so uh we can see that we first off
05:35 - add this effect then we tell the effect
05:37 - to destroy after 3 seconds and then we
05:40 - destroy the game object and we've even
05:43 - added a add coin counter here debug.log
05:46 - so we know that this is where we need to
05:48 - do it in our code so let's just delete
05:50 - that and now we can go ahead and make
05:52 - the coin counting so it's very simple uh
05:56 - first off you give the name of the
05:58 - script that the variable is is stored in
06:00 - and remember we can only do this because
06:02 - we've made it a static variable so
06:05 - that's called game master then we say
06:08 - dot and then we can just uh type in the
06:11 - variable name which is current
06:14 - score and then we can set it to
06:17 - something uh but we won't just set it to
06:19 - a fixed value we want it to be one more
06:22 - than before so therefore we do plus
06:25 - equals say plus equals
06:30 - oops uh which will add on the number
06:33 - right after it onto its current value
06:36 - and then we do one because we only want
06:37 - to add one you can you could make coins
06:41 - that are worth let's say uh 10 scores if
06:44 - it's a huge coin that's hard to get or
06:47 - if it has another color or something uh
06:49 - and then what you simply want to do is
06:50 - you want to make a variable called um
06:53 - let's say coin value and make this
06:56 - default to one and then you can change
06:58 - the it in the uh inspector and instead
07:01 - of one here we'll just do
07:04 - coin value actually that's just leave
07:07 - that in that's handy to know if we want
07:09 - to make cool powerups or something great
07:12 - so let's see if it's
07:14 - working so what we can do is we can
07:17 - select our GM and now observe our test
07:20 - variable to see if it changes and it
07:23 - certainly does it changes to one so now
07:26 - that we know that this is working we can
07:28 - go ahead and delete our test we can
07:31 - delete the function update and we can
07:33 - make our first
07:34 - GUI now uh GUI is a pretty serious
07:38 - discussion in uh in unity uh basically
07:41 - Unity have been promising a new uh guy
07:45 - uh layout system something for so long
07:49 - as I can
07:50 - remember um but it should hopefully be
07:54 - done in the near future uh but the
07:58 - specifics we really don't know and the
08:01 - reason why everyone are so longing for
08:03 - this is that the current system is well
08:06 - to say it out clearly really bad uh so
08:10 - basically there are several ways to do
08:13 - uh DUI as this you can do it completely
08:15 - through scripting which is what we are
08:17 - going to do because this is the uh
08:19 - quickest and easiest way you can also do
08:22 - it using uh an ingame thing that unitive
08:26 - made called uh it's the if I see if I
08:29 - can even find it it's thei dii texture
08:33 - that's not really a viable option either
08:35 - and uh gu is just hard on the
08:38 - computer uh though if you are willing to
08:41 - pay for uh good DUI there is a plugin
08:45 - called n GUI that's just nggi like this
08:50 - on the unity asset store and it is a
08:52 - little expensive but it's in insanely uh
08:55 - well done and most professionals use it
08:58 - around the world uh and it's the same
09:00 - guy who made this plugin who is
09:01 - currently working on the solution for uh
09:04 - for Unity but until all of this gets
09:07 - cleared out let's just use the good old
09:09 - uh GUI system so in the function on uh
09:14 - GUI where all the guy code gets called
09:18 - let's type uh
09:20 - DUI dot let's do a
09:22 - label and uh we can see that a label
09:25 - first off wants a position then it wants
09:29 - some text so what we can do is we can
09:32 - first off get it uh give it the position
09:35 - so let's do uh new
09:39 - rect like this and open this up so new
09:43 - rectangle and in here we want to do uh
09:48 - screen do
09:51 - height and uh let's do
09:54 - times
09:58 - 0.5 comma
10:00 - screen.
10:02 - width uh you could also just do divided
10:05 - by two that's up to you and let's close
10:08 - this off and then comma and then the
10:10 - string name and this is just going to be
10:13 - uh
10:14 - score and uh then close it off and end
10:18 - it up with the parentheses or a
10:20 - semicolon of course so now when we try
10:23 - to hit play we get some errors uh first
10:26 - off we can see that I've spelled height
10:28 - wrong
10:29 - that's
10:30 - annoying uh
10:32 - height like that and let's see if this
10:36 - works right so uh it says that it
10:39 - doesn't match the argument list and uh
10:43 - this is
10:44 - because uh we need to use ai. box of
10:48 - course uh so we make a new
10:51 - rectangle and uh in here we also need to
10:54 - declare the sizes so we need to do let's
10:58 - try 200 by 200 at
11:01 - first uh so now it should be working and
11:04 - yes it is and before uh let me just show
11:08 - you what it looks like and then explain
11:10 - the code so now we can see the score is
11:12 - down here and it's in a very weird
11:15 - position and let me explain what's going
11:18 - on so basically first off we uh say to
11:22 - uh make a new rectangle first the
11:24 - position on the X so this actually needs
11:28 - to be with wi then the position on the Y
11:32 - so this needs to be height and then the
11:36 - uh size on the X and then the size on
11:39 - the Y and using screen do width we can
11:43 - make it in the center by simply saying
11:45 - that we uh we start in the left hand
11:48 - corner then we go all the way to the
11:50 - right with uh our screen width and then
11:53 - we just take half of that so that's in
11:56 - the center so I'm just going to do
11:58 - divide it by two here because I get
12:00 - distracted and uh it does the same with
12:02 - the height and this way it should now be
12:06 - in the complete Center so if we hit play
12:10 - it's not really and why is this well
12:14 - Unity orients itself using the top left
12:17 - corner so what's currently in in in the
12:21 - uh in the centry is the top left corner
12:24 - of our GUI element but we want the
12:27 - middle of the GUI element to be in um in
12:31 - the middle uh and this is this is
12:33 - logical so what we can simply do is we
12:35 - can subtract half the width and half the
12:39 - height and so uh the middle of our DU
12:42 - element will be in the actual
12:45 - middle um but before we do this it's
12:48 - easy to just make these into variables
12:50 - so we can change them inside of unity
12:53 - and don't have to go back into the
12:55 - script all the time so let's just make
12:57 - these into some variables so uh we want
13:00 - them to be in the center of the screen
13:02 - uh on the width but I want the score to
13:04 - be just a bit from the top of the uh the
13:08 - screen so we don't want this screen.
13:11 - height instead uh let's make a variable
13:13 - for that so let's call this um y offset
13:18 - let's call it offset
13:20 - Y and let's just make this a float equal
13:25 - to let's try 40 by default now we can go
13:29 - in here and just type offset y then uh
13:34 - on the X we are going to do another
13:37 - variable and we're going to call this
13:39 - VAR size X of type float and this is
13:45 - going to be equal to about 800 then
13:47 - we're going to do V size y also of type
13:51 - float and this is going to be equal to
13:54 - let's say
13:56 - 40 now if we save this of course we need
14:00 - to copy in our actual variables so size
14:03 - X and size y we can go into unity and we
14:08 - can see all of these properties appear
14:11 - and we can change them in here but you
14:14 - will notice it's still not centered
14:16 - we'll take care of this in just a sec
14:18 - this is just to get a general idea
14:20 - remember that whenever you tweak
14:22 - something it while in play mode the
14:25 - changes will disappear as soon as you
14:27 - stop playing so either you have to note
14:30 - them there is a handy pluging on the
14:32 - Ence store to uh or just remember them
14:36 - so I'll try to make the Y something like
14:40 - 20 uh
14:42 - 25 25 is pretty good and the Y is
14:46 - probably fine because we want to add in
14:48 - some uh
14:51 - some numbers too we could do something
14:54 - like 90 instead actually we can go all
14:57 - the way to 80 I I think that's fine so
15:00 - 80 or 90 and uh the offset y I'm pretty
15:03 - satisfied with that so 80 and 25 so stop
15:08 - playing and change this to 80 and this
15:11 - to
15:13 - 25 uh now we can go in here and we can
15:16 - just use these variable to subtract from
15:19 - so on the screen. width we can simply
15:21 - say minus and then we can do size
15:27 - X and then divide it by two and now when
15:32 - we save this and hit play the score is
15:36 - in the exact Century because we have
15:39 - subtracted half of our x
15:43 - value now let's make uh this actually
15:46 - show our score because right now it just
15:48 - said says score so let's make uh it
15:51 - score colon and then a space and then
15:55 - outside of these parentheses you need to
15:58 - say plus current
16:01 - score and if you don't want it to say
16:04 - anything but only display the number you
16:06 - have to have these two parentheses but
16:09 - without anything in between so you still
16:11 - have to leave them there but I wanted to
16:13 - say the
16:14 - score so now we hit play and it says
16:16 - score zero when we roll into our ball it
16:19 - says score one and we have a beautiful
16:21 - label there to display the score so
16:24 - that's basically it for this video I
16:26 - hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you the
16:28 - next
16:29 - [Music]
16:39 - one

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to video number 10 in make a game a cool series on making a video game in unity so today we are going to be U making the score system uh for our players so every time we pick up a coin we are going to see some DUI on the screen it's not going to be fancy but it's going to be there that will display the score so let's just go ahead and dig right into it so as always I've opened up unity and uh what we're going to do now is we're going to first off select our coin and uh now you know what let's uh there because there are two parts to this process the first is uh of course the coin we have to uh to actually change a variable um but it's a good idea to stall this variable not on the coin itself because we will have multiple coins spread out the entire scene and so instead we could just make an uh Master game object that will have this variable and that will also take care of the dii uh and then we can just access that variable and change that so that's what we're going to do so first off let's make this master object so let's go under game object and hit create empty or press control shift and that's of course command shift n if you're on a Mac and let's go ahead and call this underscore GM and again the reason why I put an underscore is so that it will stay on top of the hierarchy let's just position all of this uh by 0000 Z that's just general good practice and let's go ahead and add a new component new script of type JavaScript and let's call this game uh Master hit create an ad and let's double click it to open it up in mono develop there we go oops this is just some of our previous script so if I zoom in on this we can go ahead and get started so first off we of course want a variable and this variable is going to be VAR uh and then we're going to call it uh current score um it's I'm just going to call it this because we might also want like a high score a master score okay let's call this a current score like this and let's going make this equal to first off it's an integer and let's make it equal to zero by default and uh what we can go ahead and do is we can make this into a variable we can access from other scripts and we do this by typing static in front of VAR so it's a static variable meaning that we can access it from all scripts uh cool so that's basically all we're going to do in here uh what we would do next is we are going to change this function to on GUI because every uh guy element is made in the on GUI function but I'm going to go ahead and talk about the uh guy system in a sec first off let's just make this variable actually change so uh you will notice that we can't see see this in the inspector so what we can just simply do is um go ahead and make a function uh that will uh allow us to see it in the inspector because static variables are invisible and we would like to just know if it's changing so to easily display it let's just make a normal variable that will that will be shown in the inspector and make it equal to the current Spore uh variable so let's just call this uh test and make it default to zero and then in the function update we'll just say test equals current score and round it off and now we should see a variable here that is zero by default try again uh wait for it to pop up we should see it in just a sec it's having trouble showing H and I can't select other objects it looks like I might need to quickly restart Unity because something has gone horribly wrong with the inspector here let's just yeah I'm just quickly going to reopen up Unity so give this a reboot I'm sorry but if this is enough I it's I don't want to cut it out so let's see if it's working now and select our GM and there it was so so we have the variable now uh I don't know why it acted so weird uh and I don't know why I can't dock it over here as I wanted to we can go under the layout and just uh select default great so now that everything is back to normal let's just go ahead and see uh what this variable does right now it simply stays zero no matter what we do because we need to find our coin and double click the coin pickup script and in here we need to change the score so uh we can see that we first off add this effect then we tell the effect to destroy after 3 seconds and then we destroy the game object and we've even added a add coin counter here debug.log so we know that this is where we need to do it in our code so let's just delete that and now we can go ahead and make the coin counting so it's very simple uh first off you give the name of the script that the variable is is stored in and remember we can only do this because we've made it a static variable so that's called game master then we say dot and then we can just uh type in the variable name which is current score and then we can set it to something uh but we won't just set it to a fixed value we want it to be one more than before so therefore we do plus equals say plus equals oops uh which will add on the number right after it onto its current value and then we do one because we only want to add one you can you could make coins that are worth let's say uh 10 scores if it's a huge coin that's hard to get or if it has another color or something uh and then what you simply want to do is you want to make a variable called um let's say coin value and make this default to one and then you can change the it in the uh inspector and instead of one here we'll just do coin value actually that's just leave that in that's handy to know if we want to make cool powerups or something great so let's see if it's working so what we can do is we can select our GM and now observe our test variable to see if it changes and it certainly does it changes to one so now that we know that this is working we can go ahead and delete our test we can delete the function update and we can make our first GUI now uh GUI is a pretty serious discussion in uh in unity uh basically Unity have been promising a new uh guy uh layout system something for so long as I can remember um but it should hopefully be done in the near future uh but the specifics we really don't know and the reason why everyone are so longing for this is that the current system is well to say it out clearly really bad uh so basically there are several ways to do uh DUI as this you can do it completely through scripting which is what we are going to do because this is the uh quickest and easiest way you can also do it using uh an ingame thing that unitive made called uh it's the if I see

the position so let's do uh new rect like this and open this up so new rectangle and in here we want to do uh screen do height and uh let's do times 0.5 comma screen. width uh you could also just do divided by two that's up to you and let's close this off and then comma and then the string name and this is just going to be uh score and uh then close it off and end it up with the parentheses or a semicolon of course so now when we try to hit play we get some errors uh first off we can see that I've spelled height wrong that's annoying uh height like that and let's see if this works right so uh

do let's try 200 by 200 at first uh so now it should be working and yes it is and before uh let me just show you what it looks like and then explain the code so now we can see the score is down here and it's in a very weird position and let me explain what's going on so basically first off we uh say to uh make a new rectangle first the position on the X so this actually needs to be with wi then the position on the Y so this needs to be height and then the uh size on the X and then the size on the Y and using screen do width we can make it in the center by simply saying that we uh we start in the left hand corner then we go all the way to the right with uh our screen width and then we just take half of that so that's in the center so I'm just going to do divide it by two here because I get distracted and uh it does the same with the height and this way it should now be in the complete Center so if we hit play it's not really and why is this well Unity orients itself using the top left corner so what's currently in in in the uh in the centry is the top left corner of our GUI element but we want the middle of the GUI element to be in um in the middle uh and this is this is logical so what we can simply do is we can subtract half the width and half the height and so uh the middle of our DU element will be in the actual middle um but before we do this it's easy to just make these into variables so we can change them inside of unity and don't have to go back into the script all the time so let's just make these into some variables so uh we want them to be in the center of the screen uh on the width but I want the score to be just a bit from the top of the uh the screen so we don't want this screen. height instead uh let's make a variable for that so let's call this um y offset let's call it offset Y and let's just make this a float equal to let's try 40 by default now we can go in here and just type offset y then uh on the X we are going to do another variable and we're going to call this VAR size X of type float and this is going to be equal to about 800 then we're going to do V size y also of type float and this is going to be equal to let's say 40 now if we save this of course we need to copy in our actual variables so size X and size y we can go into unity and we can see all of these properties appear and we can change them in here but you will notice it's still not centered we'll take care of this in just a sec this is just to get a general idea remember that whenever you tweak something it while in play mode the changes will disappear as soon as you stop playing so either you have to note them there is a handy pluging on the Ence store to uh or just remember them so I'll try to make the Y something like 20 uh 25 25 is pretty good and the Y is probably fine because we want to add in some uh some numbers too we could do something like 90 instead actually we can go all the way to 80 I I think that's fine so 80 or 90 and uh the offset y I'm pretty satisfied with that so 80 and 25 so stop playing and change this to 80 and this to 25 uh now we can go in here and we can just use these variable to subtract from so on the screen. width we can simply say minus and then we can do size X and then divide it by two and now when we save this and hit play the score is in the exact Century because we have subtracted half of our x value now let's make uh this actually show our score because right now it just said says score so let's make uh it score colon and then a space and then outside of these parentheses you need to say plus current score and if you don't want it to say anything but only display the number you have to have these two parentheses but without anything in between so you still have to leave them there but I wanted to say the score so now we hit play and it says score zero when we roll into our ball it says score one and we have a beautiful label there to display the score so that's basically it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you the next one
