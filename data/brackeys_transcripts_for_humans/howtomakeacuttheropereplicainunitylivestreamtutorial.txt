00:00 - hello everyone welcome to this video on
00:01 - creating a rope cut the rope replica
00:04 - this is a livestream tutorial
00:06 - hence the failures are going to be
00:08 - during the way and the game that we're
00:11 - going to be making looks something like
00:13 - on this if I go ahead and hit play here
00:15 - you can see that we have these different
00:17 - anger points and from each anger points
00:19 - to the weight in the center we have
00:22 - ropes and we can go ahead and cut these
00:24 - and you can see the physics changing in
00:27 - order to adapt to that and we can use
00:29 - this to create different levels with
00:32 - different puzzles so if you've never
00:34 - played cut the rope before the idea is
00:36 - to arm control this weight around the
00:40 - screen in order to pick up coins and
00:42 - eventually land in the frogs mouth to
00:45 - feed him and that can be done of course
00:48 - by manipulating these ropes so that's
00:50 - what we'll be making today we'll be
00:52 - focusing only on the rope and rope
00:54 - cutting part because I find that the
00:56 - hardest part and most essential to the
00:58 - game and the way that I have it set up
01:00 - here is we have on each rope a rope GNU
01:03 - radio script that where we can control
01:05 - the amount of links that we want and we
01:07 - have a hook or a link prefab we have a
01:10 - reference to the weight and the hook and
01:12 - then once we play it goes in and
01:14 - generate all of the parts that make up
01:16 - our chain and each one of these are
01:19 - using hinge joints in order to be
01:21 - connected to the previous one in the
01:23 - chain so that's kind of the setup that
01:25 - we have here and I don't think that we
01:27 - need to talk anymore about it let's just
01:30 - go ahead and create a new project and
01:32 - get on with it and also if you want to
01:35 - download everything for yourself there
01:36 - will be a link in the description once
01:38 - this airs on YouTube that points to a
01:40 - github where the entire project is there
01:42 - sprites scripts everything so you can
01:45 - always check that out if if you miss
01:47 - something so let's go file new projects
01:51 - and let's call this cut the rope rip the
01:57 - camp and let's change this to a 2d
01:59 - project they create project that I'm
02:01 - going to have a sip of water while it's
02:02 - loading out and I'm going to be using
02:05 - five point six point O the newest
02:07 - version currently is five point six
02:09 - point one shouldn't make a difference
02:10 - whatsoever so now we in here
02:13 - a new empty project let me begin by just
02:15 - saving my scene as let's just call it
02:18 - main just because I save all the time
02:20 - and it's going to pop up by either way
02:22 - and it's also bringing a few sprites
02:24 - here so I have my sprites as Photoshop
02:26 - files in this folder I have a background
02:28 - a hook a link and a weight and if we go
02:32 - ahead and drag all of these inside of
02:34 - unity we can see what they look like so
02:37 - here they are and let's begin by just
02:39 - taking our background into our scene
02:41 - let's also scale this up a bit let's do
02:44 - one point one on the X&Y just so that
02:47 - when we maximize our game we can we can
02:51 - see the entire background without it
02:53 - cutting off cool so that's our
02:55 - background and let's just go ahead and
02:56 - create a sorting layer for this it's
02:58 - called that storing their background
03:00 - move it to the top and let's now make
03:03 - sure that it uses that sorting layer
03:05 - just to make sure that every sprite that
03:07 - we're going to be creating is on top of
03:09 - that background cool and yes just want
03:14 - to check the viewer count there
03:15 - everything's looking good so now let's
03:17 - go ahead and bring in a hook so let's
03:20 - take our hook hook sprite here and this
03:24 - is going to be on the place from where
03:26 - or on chain is going to be anchored and
03:28 - the first thing that we want to create
03:31 - on our hook here or place is a few
03:34 - components we want first of all a sprite
03:36 - renderer we already have that we then
03:38 - want a rigidbody 2d and we're going to
03:41 - set this to kinematic because we don't
03:43 - want our hook to ever change position
03:46 - during our game it's just going to be
03:47 - stationary at the point of creation so
03:51 - that's all good then what we can do is
03:53 - maybe rename this to rope instead then
03:56 - under the rope let's go ahead and add a
03:58 - link sprite so we can see our link here
04:01 - now let's go ahead and reset the
04:03 - transform on that and we can then maybe
04:06 - move it down here so we can have a good
04:08 - look at it
04:09 - and here we want to go ahead and add a
04:11 - few components so the first component we
04:13 - want to add is a rigidbody 2d
04:15 - and this one is not going to be
04:17 - kinematic this one is going to be
04:19 - dynamic because we wanted to move
04:21 - according to on the physics system while
04:25 - the game is running and right now
04:26 - if we hit play it's just going to fall
04:28 - down because gravity is being applied
04:30 - the next thing I want to do shoes maybe
04:33 - up the mass of this object a tiny bit
04:35 - let's put it at around five that's what
04:37 - my testing found to be pretty good and
04:41 - let's also add some linear drag if you
04:43 - don't know then your drag is basically
04:44 - air resistance so it just means that
04:46 - it's going to slow down at some point if
04:49 - unless other forces are applied we also
04:53 - want to amp above the angular drag to
04:56 - say point one I found that to be a
04:57 - pretty good value so now what we can do
05:00 - is go and add a new component and the
05:02 - component we want to add now is the
05:04 - hinge joint 2d oh and this is what we'll
05:09 - be using for each part of our chain and
05:13 - this the cool thing about the hinge
05:15 - joint 2d is that it pretty much does
05:17 - everything we need for us so what we do
05:21 - here is basically connect a rigidbody
05:23 - and this is going to be the rigidbody of
05:26 - the previous part of the chain so in our
05:29 - case that would be the hook itself and
05:31 - so we would go ahead and connect the
05:33 - hook itself there but for the other
05:36 - links if we have more links in our chain
05:39 - here it's going to be the rigidbody
05:40 - right before it so we simply need to
05:43 - change these together by connecting the
05:45 - rigid bodies and then we also need to
05:47 - make sure that our anchors are correctly
05:50 - configured and to do that we want to
05:52 - check off auto-configure connected anger
05:55 - and instead going through and define one
05:57 - bar set up so make sure that whoops we
05:59 - don't want to use motor make sure that
06:00 - everything is 0 0 0 and then undo
06:04 - connected anger under the Y we want to
06:08 - go ahead and set that to minus 0.3 so
06:11 - negative 0.3 is a good starting point
06:15 - for the distance between your between
06:18 - your links in the chain and that's what
06:20 - we specify here it's the distance
06:22 - between each link and I'm going to show
06:25 - you what it looks like if you adjust
06:27 - this later but first we have to kind of
06:29 - get our chain generated in order to
06:32 - actually see what these things are doing
06:34 - so I'm just going to view a few steps
06:35 - here setting up some settings and then
06:37 - we can play around with them later
06:39 - so that is what we want I'll link to do
06:42 - and we can take this link now and turn
06:45 - it into a prefab so let's just drag it
06:47 - down to the project panel here and let's
06:49 - now remove it from our theme what we
06:52 - also want to do is go ahead and actually
06:54 - have a link that works in pretty much
06:57 - the same way but isn't a prefab so
06:59 - actually I just changed my mind let's go
07:01 - ahead and remove the prefab here and
07:03 - let's have let's duplicate this and the
07:07 - first one here we're going to call the
07:09 - hook and the second one here we're going
07:11 - to call the link and now we can take the
07:13 - link and drag down here to make it in to
07:16 - a prefab mental leave it and the reason
07:18 - for this is that we actually need a link
07:21 - element at the very beginning of our
07:24 - chain that is going to sit on top of our
07:28 - anger and it's going to behave in a tiny
07:31 - bit different way than all of the other
07:33 - links the reason for this is that I
07:35 - found when creating a chain the first
07:37 - element in India in the chain was acting
07:41 - weird until I found out that if you
07:44 - place an element of the chain on top of
07:46 - the anger point the chain suddenly had a
07:49 - more realistic field so that's what
07:51 - we're doing here we have the anchor and
07:52 - we have the first part of a chain called
07:55 - the hook at the very start or at least
07:59 - on top of each other and so now what we
08:02 - can do is take this hook here and we can
08:04 - connect the rope meaning the anchor
08:07 - point to the connected rigidbody so I'm
08:09 - dragging in the rope there and now when
08:12 - we play nothing which should happen okay
08:15 - so it's just there it's just stationary
08:16 - but really what's going on here is that
08:18 - our hook is connected to that anger
08:21 - point and what I also want to do is
08:23 - simply remove the sprite renderer at
08:25 - least disable it because we don't want
08:27 - this to be drawn so we now have an
08:30 - anchor a hook and a link prefab now all
08:35 - we need to do is go inside of our arm or
08:38 - create a component on a rope here a
08:40 - script that will generate all of the
08:43 - necessary links and add them up and hook
08:46 - them together so let's go in here and
08:48 - create a rope component it's going to be
08:51 - a c-sharp script let's say create an
08:53 - and let's double click this to open it
08:55 - up in visual studio and meanwhile I'm
08:57 - just going to have a look in the chat to
08:58 - see if everything is going I good yes
09:01 - everything's good it's awesome and yeah
09:05 - so inside a visual studio now we don't
09:08 - need any of the system data collection
09:09 - stuff so let's remove those will also be
09:11 - removing at least our update method we
09:14 - will be using start and at the top here
09:17 - let's go ahead and create a few
09:19 - variables the first one is a reference
09:22 - to our hook because we need on this the
09:26 - second element in our chain to be
09:28 - connected to the hook a third element in
09:30 - the chain will be connected to the
09:32 - second element and so on so we need a
09:34 - reference to the hook let's go in here
09:36 - and create a public and we don't need
09:38 - this to be of type game object instead
09:40 - we can make it of type hinge joint 2d
09:42 - and we'll call that hook we'll also
09:45 - create a public game object and this is
09:48 - going to be the link prefab so each link
09:51 - in our chain will be spawned using this
09:52 - prefab so let's call it link prefab and
09:56 - finally we'll have a public integer
09:59 - which is going to be the amount of links
10:01 - in our chain so let's just call this
10:03 - links and set it equal to I don't know
10:05 - seven by default then inside of our
10:09 - start method we can go ahead and call
10:11 - another method double begin creating in
10:14 - a sec called something like generate
10:16 - rope and let's make that now void
10:20 - generate rope and the first thing that
10:26 - we want to do here is loop through all
10:28 - of our links so for each link we want to
10:31 - go ahead and create one using our
10:34 - instantiate so let's write for int I
10:36 - equals 0 and we want to keep going as
10:40 - long as I is less is less than links and
10:44 - each time we go through we want to add
10:46 - one on to I so we want to increment by
10:49 - one so for these seven links we want to
10:53 - go ahead and generate a part of the rope
10:56 - to do that we'll call instantiate and
10:59 - the prefab that we want to instantiate
11:00 - is the link free fat and we want to
11:03 - parent it to our current rope object so
11:06 - as the parent will simply insert
11:10 - transform meaning our ropes transform
11:14 - cool so now we should see that when we
11:17 - hit play oh of course we need to
11:20 - reference this so let's drag in our hook
11:23 - here and let's drag in our link prefab
11:26 - and now when we hit play we should see
11:29 - that voila it spawns seven links however
11:33 - they are currently just sitting at the
11:34 - center of our scene and they aren't
11:36 - really configured in any way actually
11:38 - the hinge joint is on trying to get them
11:41 - as close to the center of our scene as
11:42 - possible and that's because we haven't
11:45 - connected any rigid bodies so in order
11:47 - to do that we first off need a reference
11:50 - to the link prefab that we just spawned
11:53 - to do that let's create a game object
11:55 - here let's call it our link and set it
11:58 - equal equal to our instantiated prefab
12:01 - we can then our get components on the
12:04 - link more specifically we want to get
12:06 - the hinge joint 2d on that link let's
12:09 - just call this joint by going link get
12:13 - component and the component that we want
12:16 - to get here is hinge joint to be called
12:21 - so now we have a reference to the hinge
12:23 - joint 2d on the generated link however
12:26 - we need to also of course go joint dot
12:30 - and then it's called connected rigid
12:34 - connected body there we go so we need to
12:37 - set the rigidbody they connect the rigid
12:39 - body of that joint equal to the previous
12:42 - rigid body in our chain now the first
12:46 - time we run through this that's going to
12:48 - be the hook the second time it's going
12:51 - to be the second element the third time
12:54 - it's going to be the third element and
12:56 - so on so we really need to go in here
13:00 - create a rigidbody 2d and let's just
13:06 - call this the previous RB and we're
13:09 - going to default this to be the hook ah
13:12 - wait okay so we need the hooks
13:16 - let's change this to game object and
13:18 - let's do dot getcomponent here because
13:20 - we need the rigid body of our hook here
13:23 - alright that's better and actually I
13:27 - think it's even cleaner if we just make
13:30 - our hook a rigidbody2d I think we can go
13:33 - ahead and do that so we don't need to
13:34 - use any getcomponent so the first time
13:37 - we run through previous rigid bodies is
13:40 - going to be equal to our hook and so
13:42 - when we set the connected body off by
13:44 - joint we set it equal to the hook
13:46 - directly then after that we can set
13:49 - previous rigid body equal to the rigid
13:53 - body of the joint that we're currently
13:55 - looking at so we'll go link get
13:57 - component of type rigidbody 2d and so
14:01 - each time we go through it's going to
14:03 - set the previous rigidbody equal to the
14:06 - connected rigidbody the connected
14:08 - rigidbody equal to the previous
14:10 - rigidbody
14:10 - and it's then going to update the
14:12 - previous rigidbody so this is going to
14:15 - run seven times and set up seven
14:16 - connection links let's try and see if
14:19 - that works and let's just make sure that
14:21 - we don't need to update anything here
14:24 - yeah okay so we need to drag in the hook
14:26 - again because we changed the type so now
14:29 - when we hit play
14:32 - voila yes things are indeed working
14:37 - however are connected anger is down here
14:40 - for some reason not working but you can
14:43 - see that we now have links where nope
14:46 - nope not working not working at all so
14:51 - what did we do wrong here previous rigid
14:54 - body equals link does get component with
14:57 - your body while am I missing guys equal
15:08 - to th should be equal to hook here
15:10 - should be a good to the link or the
15:13 - rigid body of the current link
15:14 - I believe that's fine am I missing
15:19 - something hmm
15:22 - so the first time our rigid body should
15:25 - it be equal to the hook because we want
15:27 - the first
15:29 - rid your body or the first link in our
15:31 - chain to be connected to the hook
15:33 - the next link should be connected to arm
15:36 - the first link and so the first time
15:39 - it's going to run through it's going to
15:40 - set joint are connected oh there we go
15:43 - yeah alright this should be previous
15:47 - with your body there we go thank you
15:49 - and yes the chat is now calling me
15:52 - stupid thanks guys so of course we did
15:57 - not want this to be equal to hook every
15:59 - time instead we want this to be equal to
16:01 - the previous rigid body in the chain
16:03 - cool so now we can go and hit play and
16:06 - hopefully this time there we go so the
16:09 - first one here is connected to the rope
16:11 - the second one is connected to the hook
16:14 - and now each link element in the chain
16:17 - is connected to the previous one so this
16:18 - one is connected to that one this one is
16:21 - connected to that one and it keeps going
16:24 - that's super cool because what we can
16:26 - now do if we just go ahead and select
16:28 - all of these links here we can go into
16:31 - our connected anger and set that equal
16:33 - to minus 0.3 on the Y and voila we have
16:37 - a chain cool so let's just do that
16:40 - inside of our link on a prefab here we
16:42 - can simply go and set the connected
16:44 - anchor to negative point 3 on the Y and
16:47 - now when we play by default it's just
16:50 - going to work so that's awesome and we
16:52 - can actually go in here and manipulate
16:54 - these elements if I take the last link
16:56 - in the chain here and move that around
16:58 - you can see the chain updating in real
17:01 - time and they might have some weird
17:03 - behavior and yes that is to be expected
17:06 - considering just how easy easily we set
17:09 - this up but it is working and especially
17:12 - when we add something heavy towards the
17:15 - end of the chain here this is going to
17:17 - look fairly realistic also if you don't
17:20 - want this to be kind of comprised of a
17:23 - bunch of individual links what you could
17:25 - do is use a line renderer to draw lines
17:28 - between each of these points that would
17:30 - actually make that look quite a bit more
17:32 - like rope but I'm going for the clear
17:35 - minimalistic style here so yeah this is
17:38 - what would you
17:39 - all right so thanks for helping me debug
17:42 - that so I think it's time for a sip of
17:45 - water just so I don't get too dried out
17:50 - in the throat and let me see if
17:52 - everything is working other than people
17:55 - really spamming a lot about my stupidity
17:58 - before everything is looking good so the
18:02 - next thing that we want to do is connect
18:04 - our weight at the end of the chain and
18:07 - if we have multiple chains well then we
18:09 - want to connect multiple boy then we
18:13 - want to connect all of them to the same
18:15 - weight to do that we first off have to
18:18 - go ahead and add the weight so let's
18:20 - drag in the weights right here and what
18:22 - I'm going to do is simply add a
18:23 - component this is going to be a
18:25 - rigidbody2d and this is going to be
18:28 - dynamic because we wanted to be
18:29 - simulated in our physics space we also
18:33 - want a mass of say 8 they learn your
18:36 - drag of say 0.1 and an angular drag of
18:39 - say point 1 as well now when we hit play
18:42 - we should see that that just Falls right
18:45 - away now what we could do if we try and
18:48 - hit play now is we could add a hinge
18:51 - joint to our weight here I pause the
18:55 - game just to be able to do this we could
18:57 - then connect the last part of a link to
19:01 - that hinge drawing and we can set the
19:03 - connected anchor anchor by disabling
19:05 - Auto configure here to the same negative
19:08 - 0.3 on the Y and now you should see the
19:12 - Walla or chain is connected to our
19:15 - weight so that is actually all we need
19:17 - to do through script is at runtime add a
19:20 - hinge joint for each rope that we find
19:23 - and connect the last part of that rope
19:26 - so to do that let's go ahead and create
19:29 - a script that sits on the weight and
19:31 - let's just call it the weight script and
19:33 - let's double click that to open it up in
19:36 - visual studio and in here let's create a
19:39 - method that does exactly that so let's
19:41 - go ahead and delete the two using tags
19:43 - at the top delete our to default methods
19:46 - let's create a public we want this to be
19:48 - public because we actually want our
19:50 - ropes to access our weight in order to
19:53 - do
19:53 - this and we could make it a public void
19:56 - called say on set or maybe connect rope
20:02 - end there we go
20:07 - and we of course want to pass something
20:09 - in here and the thing that we want to
20:11 - pass in is a rigidbody2d that is going
20:14 - to be the end rigidbody
20:16 - so let's just call it in our B so this
20:20 - is of course the rigidbody component of
20:23 - the last part of our chain so that would
20:26 - be this one so what we can now do is
20:30 - using this in rigidbody we could go
20:32 - ahead and call add component on the game
20:35 - object in order to add a hinge joint 2d
20:38 - and yes we do want a hinge joint for
20:41 - each rope in our scenes or if we have
20:43 - four ropes we want four hinge joints
20:45 - that are affecting the weight in each
20:48 - their direction with each their force so
20:51 - um each time we call this we want to add
20:53 - a hinge joint and we can store this in a
20:56 - variable so it's of course going to be
20:58 - of type hinge joint 2d we can call it
21:01 - joint
21:02 - and set it equal to our new component we
21:04 - can then access our joint and what we
21:07 - want to of course change here is the
21:09 - connected body we want to set that equal
21:11 - to the end of our chain which we will
21:15 - make sure to pass in here as an argument
21:17 - and we can also set up some other
21:19 - properties here so we want to go join
21:21 - anchor and we want to set this to vector
21:24 - 2.0 so we want that to be zero zero on
21:27 - both the X axes remember that our hinge
21:30 - joint here on our weight should be zero
21:33 - zero on the anchor zero on the X
21:36 - connected angry and then minus 0.3 on
21:39 - the Y connected Angra actually we could
21:42 - maybe give it a bit more room on our
21:44 - weight in particular because it's a bit
21:46 - bigger than the rest of the links but
21:49 - we'll have a look at that in a second so
21:50 - now we can go join dot and then it's
21:54 - connected anchor and this we can set
21:57 - equal to a new vector to where the first
22:00 - part our x-axis is zero and the second
22:04 - point our y-axis
22:06 - is our going to say be negative 0.3 or
22:10 - we could make this a big a bit bigger we
22:13 - could also make it into a variable that
22:14 - we can easily configure let's do that so
22:16 - let's make a public float here and this
22:18 - is going to be our on say distance from
22:22 - chain or distance from chain and
22:26 - something like that I like to be very
22:29 - specific in my naming of these variables
22:32 - even though they might have ridiculously
22:34 - long names that I'm never going to get
22:37 - forget what
22:37 - what does so that's the best part and
22:40 - let's say that equal to actually let's
22:43 - just try something like point six of
22:46 - course negative point six but if we just
22:48 - say point stakes here then we can put
22:51 - negative distance from chain and there I
22:54 - think that's cleaner when we now save
22:56 - this and then go into the rope we of
22:58 - course need to call it and we only need
23:00 - to call this on the very last link and
23:04 - so what we do is we check if I live our
23:08 - value that what the index of the element
23:12 - that we're currently looking at is less
23:15 - than links it means that or links minus
23:19 - one actually so if the element we're
23:22 - currently looking at the index of the
23:24 - element we're currently looking at which
23:25 - is first going to be 0 then 1 then 2 all
23:28 - the way up to 6 is less than links minus
23:32 - 1 so it's going to be true for all links
23:35 - except the last one because 0 or 0 is
23:39 - less than 6 1 is less than 6 2 is less
23:43 - than 6
23:44 - except for 6 and so the very last
23:47 - element here whoops the very last
23:53 - element here arm is going to not meet
23:57 - this requirement and so it's going to
23:59 - call the else statement instead so for
24:02 - all of these links until the last one we
24:05 - are going to set our previous rigid body
24:07 - equal to the current rigid body and for
24:10 - the last one only we'll go ahead and say
24:14 - arm
24:16 - find our weight we could either do that
24:19 - using find object of type or we could go
24:22 - in here and actually create a reference
24:24 - with which I think we're going to do is
24:26 - let's create a public weight and let's
24:30 - call this one weight and then down here
24:32 - we simply go weight dot arm
24:36 - connect rope end and we pass it in our
24:40 - link getcomponent rigidbody2d so whoops
24:46 - rigidbody2d so the rigid body of the
24:50 - link that we just set up boom
24:53 - all right so now that when now when we
24:55 - generate our rope we're going to go
24:57 - through generate all the link parts for
24:59 - the standard ones we're just going to
25:00 - set them up by connecting them to each
25:02 - other and then for the last one we're
25:04 - going to call connect rope end on the
25:07 - weight and we're going to pass in the
25:08 - rigid body then on the weight we'll go
25:10 - ahead and link that rigid body as the
25:14 - connected body on a weights joint
25:18 - instead of all of our settings there so
25:21 - now when we hit play or at least when we
25:23 - go into unity and select our rope drag
25:26 - in our weight and then hit play we
25:29 - should see okay so that's quite a bit of
25:33 - distance it's kind of unexpected amount
25:37 - of distance try point three on that see
25:41 - what that looks like I don't know what's
25:44 - giving us rich this much trouble oh I
25:47 - know why so under our joint we of course
25:49 - also need to make sure to set our
25:52 - anchors and what is it anchor
25:55 - auto-configure connected anchor to false
25:58 - we does we did that manually on all the
26:01 - other components here we need to do it
26:03 - through script so just make sure to say
26:06 - that defaults or unity is going to try
26:08 - and calculate some stuff for you and we
26:10 - don't want it to do that let's now set
26:12 - our distance from chain and back to 0.6
26:14 - and hit play and yay our chain is
26:18 - working and now it's actually really
26:20 - really easy to just go in here and add
26:24 - more ropes with simply duplicate our
26:26 - rope we move it over and we bump or
26:29 - we increase or lower the amount of links
26:32 - so this is a bit further away so let's
26:33 - give it more links let's try 12 for that
26:36 - one and it's going to be more than
26:38 - climbing and there you go and so now we
26:41 - can actually start having a look at
26:44 - cutting these ropes and let me show you
26:47 - how easy this is in fact all we need to
26:50 - do is go in select a certain part of the
26:53 - rope let's say this one and in order to
26:56 - cut the rope we simply delete it there
26:59 - we go and now we have rope swinging and
27:02 - it's cutting and everything is great
27:03 - hallelujah I just I love this effect so
27:08 - much because something about ropes feel
27:11 - really math intensive and they can be
27:14 - can be but unity just makes it so easy
27:17 - with hinge joints and it's just also fun
27:21 - because it feels so organic you never
27:23 - really know how a rope is going to act
27:24 - at least not these ones because they're
27:26 - weird so on yeah
27:28 - and the chest success as well that's
27:31 - good
27:32 - cool so now let's go ahead and cut up
27:34 - our chains to do that we need to
27:36 - register whether or not we hit them with
27:39 - our mouse to do that we'll need a
27:41 - Collider on the link so that we can cast
27:44 - out a raise to find out if we hit the
27:45 - collider let's go and find each part of
27:48 - our link here which is generated from
27:50 - this prefab and here we can go ahead and
27:52 - create a new circle Collider 2d and for
27:56 - the circle Collider let's just move this
27:59 - into the scene so we can see what's
28:00 - going on I want to increase the radius a
28:02 - little bit make it a tiny bit bigger
28:04 - than it needs to be I think that's good
28:07 - and let's not now hit or mark it as a
28:11 - trigger and then hit apply now we can
28:14 - remove this from our scene and we should
28:17 - now see that when you hit play and go
28:20 - into a scene here and select all of our
28:23 - links they all have our colliders so
28:27 - that's perfect what we can then do is go
28:29 - and create a new script let's set this
28:32 - on a separate object an empty object
28:33 - reset the transform in that and let's
28:36 - call this empty object something like
28:40 - hmm rope cutter
28:42 - I wanted to call it knife but I thought
28:45 - I might get flagged on you choose
28:47 - something for doing that let's move this
28:50 - to the top and let's add a component
28:53 - called rope cutter again c-sharp create
28:56 - net all that jazz let's double click it
28:58 - to open it up in visual studio and now
29:01 - on this one let's go ahead and delete
29:04 - the two using text as always let's
29:07 - delete these dark method we don't need
29:09 - that but we actually need the update for
29:11 - this one and what we want to do inside
29:14 - of our update is check if input get
29:18 - Mouse down don't get mouse button and
29:22 - the button that we want to check for is
29:24 - 0 meanness meaning left mouse button so
29:30 - 0 is left mouse button 1 is middle Mouse
29:32 - and 2 is right click or is it 1 right
29:36 - click - mailmouse I shouldn't be
29:38 - teaching that if I don't even remember
29:40 - myself let's check the docs so umm 0 is
29:45 - definitely left-click so if we click the
29:47 - left mouse button but then we want to go
29:49 - ahead and fire out a rave to check
29:51 - whether or not we hit a part of the
29:54 - chain where we're currently clicking to
29:57 - do that we first off need to get a ray
30:00 - cast hit 2d and let's just call this hit
30:05 - and it's going to store all the
30:06 - information about our ray and we'll set
30:09 - this equal to physics 2d got ray cast
30:12 - and we want to cast out a ray using
30:15 - camera main dot and this is going to be
30:20 - screen to world point and we want to get
30:25 - the world point of our mouse position so
30:28 - we'll go in put that mouse position and
30:30 - we then want to say comma vector 2.0 yes
30:37 - so basically what we're doing here is we
30:40 - are spawning a ray at the point of our
30:43 - mouse position so at on the z axis
30:46 - that's going to be 0 and then it's going
30:48 - to be wherever we click with our mouse
30:51 - and we don't actually want this raid to
30:53 - go anywhere and that's why we write
30:54 - vector to that 0 here
30:56 - we simply use the Ray kind of SA point
30:58 - is there anything that collides with the
31:00 - rate at this given point because we
31:02 - don't need to do any shooting with
31:04 - longer Ray's we just need to check at
31:06 - the point of impact so that's why we
31:09 - write it this way and we can then go
31:10 - ahead and check if hit dot Collider it's
31:14 - not equal to null so we if we've
31:16 - actually hit something well then we can
31:19 - check if hit dot tag whoops
31:22 - hit Collider tag it's equal to let's
31:26 - call it link we'll go ahead and create
31:28 - that tag in a second
31:29 - well then we've hit a certain part of a
31:31 - chain we've hit a link and we can go in
31:33 - here and destroy our hitch Collider game
31:37 - object you can destroy that link and
31:39 - that's going to cut up a room and that's
31:41 - all we need to do that's everything so
31:43 - now we can go inside of unity and we can
31:46 - find our link and we can go in here and
31:50 - add a tag the tag that we want to add
31:52 - here is linked and then for our link we
31:58 - can make sure to assign that tag you
32:01 - could go ahead and assign it to the hook
32:02 - as well if you want to be able to cut
32:04 - ropes at the very top here where the
32:07 - anchor is but I don't think that's
32:09 - needed I think it's better if we can
32:11 - only cut a rope along on the places that
32:14 - we can actually see it what I also want
32:16 - to do is make sure that this hook is
32:18 - always the need okay so it it's not too
32:22 - important for the hook here actually
32:24 - because it doesn't have a spare in it
32:25 - right but I want to make sure that our
32:26 - links it's always drawn underneath
32:29 - everything else let's go in here and
32:31 - change the audio layer to negative one
32:33 - let's also make sure that our weight is
32:36 - always drawn on top so let's change the
32:38 - order in layer two plus one cool so now
32:42 - when we hit play and if we go and try
32:46 - and click one of these links yes we have
32:49 - slicing so now we can cut the ropes any
32:52 - way that we want to and if you find that
32:54 - sometimes is misses when you try and cut
32:57 - a rope simply go into one of the links
32:59 - here and increase the radius to
33:00 - something say point I don't know point
33:04 - one eight it's going to be plenty I
33:06 - think far I taste and that should make
33:09 - sure that you can just kind of
33:10 - drag your mouse across and it's going to
33:12 - remove one link each time now we go
33:14 - that's pretty much all we needed for
33:16 - this game from here you can go and
33:18 - create levels by simply moving around
33:21 - ropes and using the building scene
33:25 - switching tools in order to switch
33:26 - between them you can add collectables
33:29 - that are rewarded whenever they get hit
33:33 - by the weight that's simply adding a
33:35 - Collider to the weight and then adding
33:38 - some kind of trigger to the collectible
33:40 - and then having something accrue once
33:42 - you do that and then also have some way
33:44 - of maybe put a frog in there to check if
33:48 - the ball reaches the end and if it does
33:51 - put up some kind of in screen that
33:53 - displays a score all this stuff is
33:55 - something I feel we've covered in in
33:57 - other videos another live stream so it's
33:59 - something that you should be able to
34:00 - pretty easily apply to this one so now
34:04 - you can just go ahead and go nuts I mean
34:07 - this is super fun and if you want to say
34:10 - remove the entire chain and not just cut
34:12 - it where we do what you can do is go in
34:15 - here and you can destroy instead of
34:18 - destroying hit collided our game object
34:21 - with them to destroy hit cool or it hit
34:24 - that transform dot parent that's the
34:26 - entire rope dart game object so we send
34:29 - we call destroy on that instead and
34:34 - whoops let me just try and save that and
34:37 - now when we play and try and slice a
34:40 - rope it's just going to get rid of the
34:42 - entire room oh and that also deletes the
34:44 - anchor but if you want you can just go
34:46 - ahead and leave the anger as a separate
34:48 - object or some kind of parent object and
34:51 - then have it delete everything else it's
34:54 - totally up to you what you could also do
34:55 - is go in here and kind of do both so in
34:59 - the very beginning here it's going to
35:02 - destroy only the arm the part of the
35:06 - chain that we hit and then after say two
35:09 - seconds it's going to destroy the entire
35:11 - rope and then you can have it fade out
35:13 - using some kind of alpha animation so
35:16 - that's what they do in the original game
35:18 - I know is is everything actually
35:20 - disappears after a second or so but you
35:24 - can
35:24 - actually see on the rope being cut so
35:27 - it's it's totally up to you you could
35:29 - also go ahead and remove all masts on
35:31 - the chain so that after it's being cut
35:34 - it doesn't have any physical influence
35:36 - on on the weight itself there's lots of
35:41 - stuff you can do so I feel that's pretty
35:42 - much everything that we needed to cover
35:45 - in this video I just want to go ahead
35:48 - and try and create really really large
35:50 - chain let's see we can select this one
35:56 - let's try and create something with
35:58 - forty links see what happens oh now
36:01 - that's chaotic it actually works I was
36:04 - I'm surprised to see that this doesn't
36:06 - break in some way but I it actually
36:09 - behaves pretty well well it's so cool
36:13 - let's zoom out with the camera here
36:15 - let's see our huge chain working and
36:17 - nevermind the background all that's
36:20 - awesome I'm a huge fan of this you can
36:23 - now take the chain here let's drag it up
36:25 - here and see what happens
36:26 - look at it go oh that's so cool and we
36:31 - can splice this up in any way that we
36:33 - want to okay so as you can see there's
36:37 - plenty of fun to be had with this so I
36:39 - hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial part
36:41 - of this our video now we're going to
36:43 - switch over to a Q&A format so if you
36:46 - guys have any questions whatsoever write
36:51 - them to me in the chat and I will do my
36:54 - best to answer and also we'll have a
36:56 - look at some blue blue team Diaries
36:57 - stuff in just a second here so that's
37:00 - awesome so let me just switch over to
37:03 - chat format there we go and now you
37:07 - should be able to see the chat as well
37:09 - and let me start reading some questions
37:13 - here do I have a college degree no I do
37:16 - not please make a complete level with it
37:19 - I am sorry that's all we're going to be
37:20 - doing today but I will have the project
37:23 - file for you if you want to get it for
37:25 - yourself let me see couldn't you just
37:27 - disable them yeah of course you can
37:29 - disable them as well if you don't want
37:31 - to remove them completely that would be
37:34 - I would recommend putting some kind of
37:36 - animation that fades out the Alpha
37:38 - channel that would look pretty cool and
37:41 - in general I would probably recommend
37:43 - using a line renderer but if you want to
37:45 - learn more about line renderer so you
37:46 - should check out our I think the a few
37:52 - months ago but we did a live stream on
37:55 - kind of doing a acting to cool also
37:59 - called curve fever on replica and that's
38:04 - pretty cool so that that's using the new
38:06 - unity line renderer from five point six
38:09 - five point five I don't exactly remember
38:12 - when it was introduced but it's a lot
38:14 - better and you should be able to fairly
38:16 - easily apply it here simply have each
38:18 - game object act as a point in the line
38:20 - renderer and and which it should look
38:21 - cool I'm from Denmark how long have you
38:25 - been working on games I've been creating
38:27 - games pretty much my entire life or at
38:30 - least the live voice at least trying to
38:32 - but I've been working professionally
38:35 - with games since I started this channel
38:37 - very much which is five years ago
38:39 - something like that then maybe a year or
38:43 - two before that trying to kind of get
38:46 - into the whole thing but the channel
38:48 - here and I have pretty much grown
38:50 - together how did you learn programming
38:54 - that world oh thank you after all the
38:58 - mistakes I just made I made you think a
39:00 - program well well that's that's awesome
39:02 - you guys are too generous I I learn
39:05 - programming are from mostly unity
39:07 - tutorials back then it was well it
39:11 - depends on what you mean programming
39:12 - I've learned many different programming
39:15 - languages in both web and and other
39:19 - runtime languages and if you if you're
39:23 - talking about game development mostly in
39:26 - unity then it was YouTube tutorials and
39:28 - it's also my preferred work a way of
39:30 - learning back then it was tomato twinks
39:32 - that helped me get started how did you
39:36 - make the camera follow script and
39:37 - shrinking plan and I do not want to talk
39:39 - about that check out the source code
39:41 - it's it's on the Ludum dare a page and
39:44 - you can you can see for yourself it's
39:46 - not pretty
39:48 - do you have some secret knowledge as
39:51 - well a little bit I'm not a good see
39:53 - let's watch programmer but I can read
39:54 - most C++ codes because some of it gets
39:57 - really hairy but I feel I know my way
40:00 - around the language wouldn't be
40:02 - comfortable getting a job having to
40:05 - write C++ code but on a hobby level it's
40:09 - fine I guess
40:13 - let's see have I finished the university
40:16 - haven't even started so no I don't plan
40:20 - to go to university not at least not for
40:23 - now I'm having too much fun with this
40:25 - and I find that I can can do much more
40:30 - creative stuff this way and if I went to
40:32 - university so let's see can you actually
40:38 - make a living from mobile games you can
40:41 - but it's super tough the mobile game
40:44 - industry has kind of changed in the
40:47 - beginning when everyone was first
40:49 - getting into the app market it was
40:51 - really if you got an app on the App
40:53 - Store and if you got just a tiny bit
40:55 - featured you could make a lot of money
40:58 - on that that time is long long gone
41:01 - there are so many competing apps
41:03 - especially games now that cracking that
41:06 - market is just the most difficult thing
41:08 - ever you can definitely make a living
41:11 - creating games but you need contacts or
41:15 - you need budget and you need to create
41:17 - many games not just one having being
41:20 - able to live off of one game is rare
41:22 - just telling your heart is it still
41:25 - super fun though and I recommend you do
41:27 - it the source code you posted under is
41:31 - not working for me I'm sorry I don't
41:36 - know why that would be pretty sure I
41:38 - tested it it worked for me before then
41:40 - I'm using JUnit II 5.6 so I think you
41:43 - should make sure that you're using the
41:45 - same version I haven't heard any other
41:48 - complaints that it wasn't working so
41:49 - yeah I'm sorry I can't really
41:50 - troubleshoot that with you right now how
41:53 - do you get assets for games dev assets
41:56 - of course if you go to dev assets calm
41:58 - you can download free high quality asset
42:00 - packs
42:01 - pay what you want so you can choose the
42:03 - price and that means a minimum of price
42:05 - of zero but definitely awesome if you
42:09 - want to help support me in the artists
42:11 - that's a good place you and the asset
42:13 - store is a great place and yeah those
42:16 - are probably the two biggest ones that I
42:19 - can think of this let's see here isn't
42:25 - it extensive to live in Copenhagen yes
42:27 - Copenhagen this is an expensive city so
42:30 - yeah it is and not really much to say
42:35 - about that Copenhagen is just overall
42:38 - expensive do you code your own shaders
42:42 - do you think unity should implement a
42:44 - material node inspector like unreal
42:45 - engines so arm I do sometimes delve into
42:51 - the world of shader programming when I
42:53 - do it not pretty
42:55 - I've done a few successful shaders
42:57 - mostly I do it following some kind of
42:59 - tutorial but I feel now that I mostly do
43:03 - it out of habit because I'm not
43:04 - comfortable writing shaders but most of
43:07 - the time and I can do it without however
43:11 - especially since unity updated to the
43:13 - new standard shader there are some
43:16 - things that I haven't really rubbed my
43:17 - head around mostly because I get to do
43:20 - it so rarely but I think it's really fun
43:23 - to do I think that's really something
43:25 - really gratifying about creating code
43:27 - that directly affects graphics that's
43:29 - really fun and that's just so much
43:31 - creative stuff you can do which with
43:33 - shaders so I don't know why I haven't
43:36 - gotten into it more it's probably just
43:37 - because um you guys haven't been asking
43:40 - for it on the channel and most of what I
43:42 - do with unity is is for the channel in
43:45 - terms of grading a node editor that
43:48 - would be the coolest thing ever but then
43:50 - again there are some really good assets
43:52 - out there such as shader Forge that
43:55 - allow you to do that so as long as there
43:57 - is a method and this time there there is
43:59 - I don't think it should be that top
44:01 - priority at the moment definitely not I
44:03 - think the standard shader suits 99% of
44:07 - of what you need to do with with shaders
44:10 - I did pick up blender recently though ah
44:13 - got plenty I did start using blender
44:16 - again recently because I wanted to
44:17 - prepare for the series and also because
44:19 - I just think blender so so fun and I
44:21 - mean their node editor is just amazing
44:23 - so it is hard not to get envious of that
44:26 - but I really mean it's it's it's more of
44:32 - a fun thing than it's something that's
44:33 - really needed um thank you for the
44:41 - compliments by the way guys what
44:44 - programming language would you recommend
44:46 - for a beginner depends on what you want
44:48 - to do I would always recommend the
44:49 - programming language that gets you or
44:52 - that allows you to do what you want to
44:54 - do the quickest because I think the most
44:56 - important thing for beginners is
44:57 - capturing their interest and showing
44:59 - them that programming is not books and
45:02 - it's not API programming is creative and
45:05 - it's something that allows you to make
45:06 - something and so I would always say if
45:09 - you want to make a webpage start with
45:11 - HTML you can get something up and
45:13 - running right away if you want to make
45:15 - something sciency or if you want to make
45:18 - automated tasks or anything like that
45:20 - start with Python if you want to make
45:23 - games maybe start with unity or maybe
45:26 - not maybe start with something easier
45:29 - like JavaScript or um like regular
45:32 - JavaScript not unity script or maybe
45:35 - game maker so totally depends on what
45:37 - you want to do but I do believe that
45:39 - unity is a great tool for showing how
45:41 - creative you can be with always
45:42 - programming I am 20 years old ah why
45:47 - unity over unreal no particular reason
45:49 - because I don't really favor unity over
45:51 - unreal okay that's a lie I do favor
45:56 - unity over and rely on quite a few
45:58 - things but I think that whenever it
46:00 - comes to what engineer should choose it
46:02 - totally depends on what game you want to
46:03 - make so unity over unreal is just a
46:06 - matter of me thinking that unity fits
46:08 - the types of games that I make most of
46:10 - the time I've never actually embarked
46:12 - upon a project where I thought one wheel
46:14 - would be a better guess especially
46:15 - because most of the stuff that I do is
46:17 - done by me alone when it comes to game
46:22 - projects and if I had a bigger team I
46:24 - would probably say otherwise
46:27 - what's your favorite game have one will
46:30 - Duvall craft counter-strike I can know
46:32 - one of the big tiles I think um exactly
46:36 - unity and unreal both have their good
46:38 - and bad points let's let's tell you
46:40 - right let's see for a web developer and
46:45 - designer mainly using javascript CSS
46:47 - HTML sometimes PHP which is the best
46:49 - program to start making games I'd like
46:52 - to make some simple but fun games in my
46:54 - spare time unity I know I can use chaos
46:57 - and unity to yeah I think if you have
46:59 - experience with web development pick up
47:02 - unity I think game maker is probably the
47:05 - big contester when it comes to quickly
47:08 - getting into making games using some
47:10 - kind of a engine with an interface not
47:12 - that you want to go the riot route of
47:14 - clips or anything like that but I would
47:18 - always recommend picking up unity then
47:20 - just because javascript is going to be
47:22 - very familiar to you and allows you to
47:24 - not so much focus on language but more
47:26 - focus on what's unity specific what does
47:28 - it mean making a game also kind of get
47:31 - you in the groove of managing assets and
47:34 - setting up scenes and levels and what
47:37 - all these different dials mean without
47:39 - the big overhead so yeah I would suggest
47:42 - you in any video definitely um let's see
47:48 - am I ever going to do a gaming stream at
47:51 - least the stream that isn't tutorial
47:52 - related maybe for this stream I actually
47:54 - thought about creating or making an
47:56 - entire stream where I only play Ludum
47:59 - dare games that you guys have made or
48:01 - other games that you might want me to
48:03 - play and that could be super fun to do I
48:05 - want to play what you make and see what
48:08 - you are able to do especially maybe if
48:10 - the game was inspired by a tutorial of
48:13 - mine that would be I mean it's always
48:15 - awesome to see the what you put out
48:18 - there it's actually maybe helping
48:19 - someone so that could be really fun to
48:23 - do and with that let's play some games
48:27 - let's do it so I'm going to jump on
48:34 - let's see here let's change the layout
48:36 - again they are just changing guys
48:39 - so let's go to LG Jem calm and I am
48:46 - going to log in here and I'm going to do
48:49 - that off screen um and I don't remember
48:54 - the login well I did it's great so here
48:59 - the note if you don't know Ludum dare I
49:02 - say game development competition where
49:04 - you get 48 hours to create a game from
49:06 - scratch using only self-made assets and
49:08 - it's super fun look that's me
49:11 - Hey haha that's so cool I didn't know
49:14 - that these were showing up in on the
49:17 - Ludum dare a side that's fun huh anyway
49:22 - it's a 48 hours way that you get to make
49:26 - a game from scratch using some kind of
49:28 - theme and the theme this time was small
49:32 - world and I made a game called shrinking
49:34 - planet and it looks like this and it
49:38 - allows you to drive around the small
49:41 - planet while trying to avoid meteors and
49:44 - I found this fire icon and it's gotta be
49:46 - super cool and you can go ahead and
49:49 - download it I'm just going to throw a
49:50 - link in the description here to those
49:52 - who want to check that out you can play
49:55 - it in the web browser let's just
49:56 - actually try and maybe have a quick play
49:59 - here and let me see if I can get some
50:03 - desktop all your working I think I think
50:07 - maybe that it's streaming the audio but
50:10 - I really have no idea let's try and hit
50:13 - play here and it does black in the
50:14 - beginning a tiny bit in whoops in the
50:18 - browser here and you can also see the
50:19 - grass shader is nearly as nice in the
50:22 - browser I don't know why I played in a
50:24 - nice browser I think I already have it
50:26 - installed actually fit through this
50:29 - write shrinking planet no no yes maybe
50:40 - shrinking planet bilks windows x86 there
50:45 - we go cool it's booting up now yeah I
50:50 - wanted to show you guys to grass shader
50:51 - it's the best part it's
50:53 - year I made it using a tutorial by Ellen
50:55 - Saucony you can see how much better that
50:57 - looks now so I have no idea if audio is
51:01 - coming through let me know is that
51:02 - that's working if not it's not too
51:04 - important just wanted to maybe get that
51:08 - set up soon because some of the games I
51:10 - thought this dude and I really had
51:12 - really nice audio that I thought should
51:14 - be showcased if not you can always watch
51:18 - my video on kind of behind the scenes
51:20 - stuff so I did a a not so much a
51:23 - post-mortem but more of a making us
51:25 - video on this particular game it's it's
51:27 - up now on the YouTube channel go check
51:29 - that out and the cool thing is look how
51:34 - well we did guys tada
51:38 - we were number one in theme yes
51:41 - celebration and the white balance on my
51:43 - camera is the love I feel eighty eight
51:45 - eighty HD today hyper it's probably
51:49 - because I've had to do so much boring
51:51 - work so this week I'm pretty excited to
51:54 - to be doing some live streaming and we
51:57 - we got number eight in graphics and um
52:01 - numbers 13 overall so I'm super happy
52:04 - about this I mean it's a huge
52:06 - improvement from my last submission
52:08 - first of all and it's also just getting
52:10 - number one in a category it's so cool
52:16 - ah so I was really really excited about
52:19 - this um I think some of the judgments
52:22 - here are not really fair I don't think
52:26 - necessarily that I did that well in
52:29 - innovation and I definitely think um
52:34 - that my humor rating should have been
52:40 - lower as well because I had no jokes in
52:42 - there whatsoever so I I think some of
52:46 - these are a bit too good but I'm happy
52:51 - about it I shouldn't complain but yeah
52:53 - so and and the feedback that you guys
52:56 - left was just awesome I mean look at all
52:58 - these comments and a lot of really good
53:01 - feedback as well
53:02 - I spoke to Sebastian as well he also
53:03 - left a comment here Sebastian leg if you
53:05 - know him personally
53:07 - - BRR he did a he had some really nice
53:10 - feedback I think one of the main
53:12 - problems with this game it was also
53:14 - something that I wanted to add but
53:16 - simply hadn't didn't have the time is
53:18 - the fact that you can just drive
53:20 - straight and then not get hit by meteors
53:23 - for 10 20 seconds that's the problem I
53:26 - should have some kind of targeting that
53:28 - sometimes put a meteor in front of the
53:30 - players or he has to react that would
53:32 - make it a lot better also feel that
53:34 - sometimes it's a bit too fast paced and
53:36 - it feels unfair when you simply aren't
53:39 - able to dodge a media or even though you
53:41 - were trying your hardest so it's also
53:44 - something that I should have a look at
53:45 - but overall I was really happy with the
53:48 - submission and if you didn't watch the
53:50 - last stream
53:51 - ah Sophia my lovely fiancee um did a
53:56 - game as well called me 'dom so look at
54:00 - this so here you go that was her first
54:03 - Ludum dare a submission and she did well
54:06 - as well for first submission she got a
54:08 - number 66 in humor that's pretty cool I
54:11 - also really liked her interpretation of
54:13 - the team actually thought that 120
54:16 - wasn't enough for that because her theme
54:19 - interpretation is awesome I think pretty
54:22 - much everyone did something with small
54:23 - planets including myself and I don't
54:26 - really think it's fair that I got more
54:28 - in theme but but alright it's I guess
54:32 - it's the voting system so shouldn't
54:34 - complain but you can check that out as
54:36 - well
54:36 - I'll leave a link in the chat if you
54:39 - want to go play that as well so yeah
54:42 - guys um if you have a little diary
54:44 - submission that you want me to play or a
54:46 - game that you made using one of my
54:48 - tutorials keep it a little diary here in
54:50 - the beginning maybe definitely through
54:53 - it in the in the description I want to
54:55 - check it out this one here called
54:57 - battlehex it sounds cool oh no this
55:02 - looks complicated yes let's try it out
55:05 - and oh you didn't get enough ratings hmm
55:10 - one rating tsys I'm sorry download the
55:15 - game on your chair let's do that
55:19 - dddd oh it's a WebGL perfect those are
55:23 - the best points I'm just gonna add it to
55:26 - the water while it's loading okay so the
55:35 - goal is to either remove all enemy pawns
55:38 - or find the chest with gold this game is
55:41 - meant to be played with two players on
55:42 - one screen oh do you want to join in
55:48 - awesome
55:50 - I've no idea what to do we should be two
55:57 - players and I don't know how this is
56:00 - what's going on okay I think this is you
56:05 - now it's some kind of I have no idea to
56:09 - tell us what to do here come Jane let's
56:18 - sit closer okay I guess I'll try to
56:23 - press over you oh okay so you can I
56:28 - think you should place units down here
56:31 - but you can only place at the beginning
56:33 - so it's like it's like chess all right
56:37 - and I guess the bluest water in the
56:39 - ground is grass I think you should hit
56:43 - okay now without knowing anything let's
56:45 - click to choose a pond and child to move
56:47 - to right click and drag or vast keys to
56:50 - move the camera all right
56:51 - so I can choose a pawn now oh let's see
56:54 - and it's about getting the gold I think
57:00 - okay my turn
57:02 - yeah I'm going aggressively for the gold
57:06 - when you start you have to play three
57:08 - punch on the first row of the board and
57:09 - then click ok button right top right
57:12 - corner this will start a gaming reason
57:14 - and then to attack an enemy spawn I open
57:16 - the chest you have to strike backwards
57:19 - okay yes I'll do that
57:24 - okay this is going to be easy we place a
57:27 - chest sometimes you know sparring on the
57:32 - channel good yeah I'm going to be used
57:39 - to this one I'm sorry can i huh you have
57:44 - to strike backwards well so you have to
57:47 - get in front of it I don't I want to do
57:50 - this can I can I do this now
57:52 - nope how do I get the cold yes yes I did
58:05 - it boom
58:07 - one zero no no - no - my chest so I
58:18 - think some some things that are really
58:20 - working for this game are the overall
58:23 - feel of the movement I mean the controls
58:25 - are snappy and it's clear to see where
58:27 - the where the units eye on what's going
58:29 - on I don't necessarily need thing that
58:31 - you need to be able to control the
58:33 - camera I think maybe just a more
58:34 - top-down view would be fine
58:36 - kind of like and chest you don't really
58:38 - see the ability to move the camera there
58:39 - also the music is working one thing that
58:43 - I do find a bit weird is kind of reading
58:49 - how the environment affect the decision
58:52 - you make I find right now it's mostly
58:56 - maybe because I'm not too good at it
58:58 - just a matter of racing to the nearest
59:00 - chest and I don't see many layers of
59:04 - strategy I don't really see how the
59:06 - colors of the board affect your okay so
59:09 - that's pretty annoying okay so that's
59:13 - actually really annoying um so yeah
59:16 - overall cool game yeah shouldn't have
59:21 - done that I'm gonna get you now
59:28 - okay and game over got the gold yes
59:36 - thanks for joining in it okay cool so
59:40 - I'm going to put back the black screen
59:42 - but everything still works Cole I'm
59:46 - going to close down the game here if you
59:49 - guys have any more games I would love to
59:50 - try them out just throw a link in in the
59:53 - chat and we'll have look also I will
59:56 - readjust the white balance on my camera
59:59 - here because it's it's bad it's really
60:03 - red let's see if we can make that better
60:06 - that's a bit better good enough
60:10 - so yeah throw me links let me see you
60:14 - guys had a bunch of links last time so I
60:16 - hope that you guys throw me something
60:19 - this time as well I just have to update
60:20 - my chat here as well because it's it's
60:23 - for some reason is just stuck cold so
60:26 - toniest tony has a game as well it's
60:29 - called what's it called miniature
60:32 - adventure oh that's cool so you didn't
60:36 - get enough ratings of flood it was a
60:37 - huge problem with duda at this time no
60:41 - one was getting ratings and it's because
60:43 - the rating system got out so so late and
60:46 - yeah everything just got pushed pushed
60:48 - back but okay so this looks like
60:51 - something on that I can figure out how
60:54 - to do made in a in Gia's with my custom
60:57 - engine that's cool man
60:58 - next to begin all right I'm in bored
61:03 - hell yeah loving the music already
61:06 - failing but loving the music I don't
61:08 - know if you guys are able to hear this
61:09 - music but it's awesome
61:11 - oh you get made smaller oh it's so cool
61:17 - right God's the spikes which I said to
61:24 - do
61:25 - Jesus okay can do this this is your own
61:31 - engine that's awesome
61:32 - well I'm loving this and so here
61:35 - everything's smaller well that's really
61:38 - cool
61:38 - one thing I would probably do for this
61:40 - is I'll make sure to swim in the camera
61:43 - a bit more once the our player gets
61:45 - small I find it's a bit too far away
61:47 - maybe in order to be able to see all the
61:50 - action but I really like the shrinking
61:53 - mechanic also one thing that you can do
61:55 - is maybe interpolate between the two
61:57 - sizes because right now it just
61:59 - instantly gets small it would be cool if
62:01 - it kind of gradually zoomed in instead
62:03 - but these are just small smaller points
62:08 - okay so we're going down oh oh well
62:14 - that's so cool
62:15 - ah I think I failed
62:19 - yeah I've got oh yes but the music is
62:25 - perfect I feel like if the Leno is
62:26 - superhero something oh ok so that felt
62:31 - unfair there you go pretty much have to
62:34 - make sure that always lands on the top
62:37 - one there it's not nice dying and not
62:41 - really feeling that you have a stay in Y
62:45 - trends one more time
62:47 - okay this time I'll get it stand there
62:50 - go here go there oh I have to go to the
62:54 - other side Jesus okay we do the case
62:57 - [Music]
63:01 - stand here now go here and there we go
63:04 - yes perfect level complete Oh No that
63:09 - doesn't look right
63:10 - Oh see I have to go to the other side
63:13 - here this is super cool time racing and
63:18 - with your minute yourself ah to be fast
63:23 - no not gonna make it I just made it all
63:26 - it's so cold
63:29 - okay so this are these these levels is
63:34 - falling levels ah the worst I can never
63:40 - do it
63:41 - my reactionary skills of way too bad for
63:44 - this so anyway I don't know have to do
63:48 - it ah see not gonna happen
63:52 - feel old when I get these levels yep
63:58 - this is why I'm giving up awesome game
64:00 - man really enjoying it
64:02 - I think the graphics are nice
64:04 - minimalistic they do what they should
64:06 - and yeah oh well good game well done
64:11 - let's see let's see if there are any
64:17 - other links here to try out we may be a
64:22 - trial run one more didn't get much most
64:26 - votes so that you can play tennis again
64:28 - it's my first interest I hope you
64:29 - enjoyed all right we'll check it out
64:32 - asteroid shooter oh that looks cool I
64:36 - believe I saw this actually on there
64:41 - download there we go and just wait for
64:46 - this turn on download and install see so
64:50 - this is a game by ah oh where is it
64:56 - Mick well L mm
65:00 - final build yes please let's just put
65:03 - this on the desktop clean up in a sec
65:06 - okay so this is probably going to be the
65:08 - last game guys then we'll wrap up the
65:10 - stream because also have to kind of
65:12 - process all of the footage and upload
65:14 - stuff to github and such but it I had a
65:16 - blast that's for sure so let's try and
65:18 - coconut asteroid chew here let's do a
65:22 - windowed one here too and small new size
65:26 - choose that one yes that's perfect play
65:33 - see what this is about
65:36 - play game arrow keys to control alright
65:40 - you can do that oh yes okay I get it
65:45 - right away okay so the controls here
65:48 - really nice it's really it's actually
65:55 - fairly easy to hit the asteroid to think
65:58 - something about the speed is well
66:00 - balanced really like are the exploding
66:05 - graphics as well really really simple
66:07 - particles but they do that job and now
66:10 - we get big asteroids it's a good thing
66:12 - that you have health bars in here what
66:13 - you could also do is maybe just have the
66:15 - asteroids shrink instead each time you
66:18 - hit them that way it gets more and more
66:20 - difficult the more you play or on the
66:24 - morass the more you hit the asteroid
66:25 - kind of have chunks follow them I really
66:28 - like how you have the asteroid split up
66:29 - into multiple ones that's kind of adds
66:31 - another layer but I think you could do
66:33 - that with helps us walk maybe but ya
66:37 - don't know why this didn't we'd get that
66:39 - much many votes this is an awesome game
66:41 - as well oh no you're perfect so I mean a
66:47 - simple thing that you could add on this
66:49 - type of game I joined game over it's
66:54 - some kind of upgrade menu I think this
66:56 - is one of those games that could really
66:58 - keep people hooked if you get a way to
67:00 - upgrade your planet up get more guns in
67:03 - there get health upgrades shields
67:06 - automatic turret turrets nuclear bombs
67:09 - that kind of destroy everything on the
67:11 - screen stuff like that you could also
67:13 - have it so that you
67:14 - shoot up grapes around the screen so if
67:16 - you just take your time maybe a few
67:18 - seconds to shoot something on the screen
67:19 - that business asteroid in return you get
67:21 - some kind of bonus powerup so that's
67:24 - something that I would probably add
67:26 - there but really well done so I believe
67:30 - that is all that we are going to do
67:33 - today so that's pretty much the end of
67:35 - the livestream guys I hope you enjoyed
67:37 - it I really did as always and yeah if
67:41 - you want to watch this live stream it

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to this video on creating a rope cut the rope replica this is a livestream tutorial hence the failures are going to be during the way and the game that we're going to be making looks something like on this if I go ahead and hit play here you can see that we have these different anger points and from each anger points to the weight in the center we have ropes and we can go ahead and cut these and you can see the physics changing in order to adapt to that and we can use this to create different levels with different puzzles so if you've never played cut the rope before the idea is to arm control this weight around the screen in order to pick up coins and eventually land in the frogs mouth to feed him and that can be done of course by manipulating these ropes so that's what we'll be making today we'll be focusing only on the rope and rope cutting part because I find that the hardest part and most essential to the game and the way that I have it set up here is we have on each rope a rope GNU radio script that where we can control the amount of links that we want and we have a hook or a link prefab we have a reference to the weight and the hook and then once we play it goes in and generate all of the parts that make up our chain and each one of these are using hinge joints in order to be connected to the previous one in the chain so that's kind of the setup that we have here and I don't think that we need to talk anymore about it let's just go ahead and create a new project and get on with it and also if you want to download everything for yourself there will be a link in the description once this airs on YouTube that points to a github where the entire project is there sprites scripts everything so you can always check that out if if you miss something so let's go file new projects and let's call this cut the rope rip the camp and let's change this to a 2d project they create project that I'm going to have a sip of water while it's loading out and I'm going to be using five point six point O the newest version currently is five point six point one shouldn't make a difference whatsoever so now we in here a new empty project let me begin by just saving my scene as let's just call it main just because I save all the time and it's going to pop up by either way and it's also bringing a few sprites here so I have my sprites as Photoshop files in this folder I have a background a hook a link and a weight and if we go ahead and drag all of these inside of unity we can see what they look like so here they are and let's begin by just taking our background into our scene let's also scale this up a bit let's do one point one on the X&Y just so that when we maximize our game we can we can see the entire background without it cutting off cool so that's our background and let's just go ahead and create a sorting layer for this it's called that storing their background move it to the top and let's now make sure that it uses that sorting layer just to make sure that every sprite that we're going to be creating is on top of that background cool and yes just want to check the viewer count there everything's looking good so now let's go ahead and bring in a hook so let's take our hook hook sprite here and this is going to be on the place from where or on chain is going to be anchored and the first thing that we want to create on our hook here or place is a few components we want first of all a sprite renderer we already have that we then want a rigidbody 2d and we're going to set this to kinematic because we don't want our hook to ever change position during our game it's just going to be stationary at the point of creation so that's all good then what we can do is maybe rename this to rope instead then under the rope let's go ahead and add a link sprite so we can see our link here now let's go ahead and reset the transform on that and we can then maybe move it down here so we can have a good look at it and here we want to go ahead and add a few components so the first component we want to add is a rigidbody 2d and this one is not going to be kinematic this one is going to be dynamic because we wanted to move according to on the physics system while the game is running and right now if we hit play it's just going to fall down because gravity is being applied the next thing I want to do shoes maybe up the mass of this object a tiny bit let's put it at around five that's what my testing found to be pretty good and let's also add some linear drag if you don't know then your drag is basically air resistance so it just means that it's going to slow down at some point if unless other forces are applied we also want to amp above the angular drag to say point one I found that to be a pretty good value so now what we can do is go and add a new component and the component we want to add now is the hinge joint 2d oh and this is what we'll be using for each part of our chain and this the cool thing about the hinge joint 2d is that it pretty much does everything we need for us so what we do here is basically connect a rigidbody and this is going to be the rigidbody of the previous part of the chain so in our case that would be the hook itself and so we would go ahead and connect the hook itself there but for the other links if we have more links in our chain here it's going to be the rigidbody right before it so we simply need to change these together by connecting the rigid bodies and then we also need to make sure that our anchors are correctly configured and to do that we want to check off autoconfigure connected anger and instead going through and define one bar set up so make sure that whoops we don't want to use motor make sure that everything is 0 0 0 and then undo connected anger under the Y we want to go ahead and set that to minus 0.3 so negative 0.3 is a good starting point for the distance between your between your links in the chain and that's what we specify here it's the distance between each link and I'm going to show you what it looks like if you adjust this later but first we have to kind of get our chain generated in order to actually see what these things are doing so I'm just going to view a few steps here setting up some settings and then we can play around with them later so that is what we want I'll link to do and we can take this link now and turn it into a prefab so let's just drag it down to the project panel here and let's now remove it from our theme what we also want to do is go ahead and actually have a link that works in pretty much the same way but isn't a prefab so actually I just changed my mind let's go ahead and remove the prefab here and let's have let's duplicate this and the first one here we're going to call the hook and the second one here we're going to call the link and now we can take the link and drag down here to make it in to a prefab mental leave it and the reason for this is that we actually need a link element at the very beginning of our chain that is going to sit on top of our anger and it's going to behave in a tiny bit different way than all of the other links the reason for this is that I found when creating a chain the first element in India in the chain was acting weird until I found out that if you place an element of the chain on top of the anger point the chain suddenly had a more realistic field so that's what we're doing here we have the anchor and we have the first part of a chain called the hook at the very start or at least on top of each other and so now what we can do is take this hook here and we can connect the rope meaning the anchor point to the connected rigidbody so I'm dragging in the rope there and now when we play nothing which should happen okay so it's just there it's just stationary but really what's going on here is that our hook is connected to that anger point and what I also want to do is simply remove the sprite renderer at least disable it because we don't want this to be drawn so we now have an anchor a hook and a link prefab now all we need to do is go inside of our arm or create a component on a rope here a script that will generate all of the necessary links and add them up and hook them together so let's go in here and create a rope component it's going to be a csharp script let's say create an and let's double click this to open it up in visual studio and meanwhile I'm just going to have a look in the chat to see if everything is going I good yes everything's good it's awesome and yeah so inside a visual studio now we don't need any of the system data collection stuff so let's remove those will also be removing at least our update method we will be using start and at the top here let's go ahead and create a few variables the first one is a reference to our hook because we need on this the second element in our chain to be connected to the hook a third element in the chain will be connected to the second element and so on so we need a reference to the hook let's go in here and create a public and we don't need this to be of type game object instead we can make it of type hinge joint 2d and we'll call that hook we'll also create a public game object and this is going to be the link prefab so each link in our chain will be spawned using this prefab so let's call it link prefab and finally we'll have a public integer which is going to be the amount of links in our chain so let's just call this links and set it equal to I don't know seven by default then inside of our start method we can go ahead and call another method double begin creating in a sec called something like generate rope and let's make that now void generate rope and the first thing that we want to do here is loop through all of our links so for each link we want to go ahead and create one using our instantiate so let's write for int I equals 0 and we want to keep going as long as I is less is less than links and each time we go through we want to add one on to I so we want to increment by one so for these seven links we want to go ahead and generate a part of the rope to do that we'll call instantiate and the prefab that we want to instantiate is the link free fat and we want to parent it to our current rope object so as the parent will simply insert transform meaning our ropes transform cool so now we should see that when we hit play oh of course we need to reference this so let's drag in our hook here and let's drag in our link prefab and now when we hit play we should see that voila it spawns seven links however they are currently just sitting at the center of our scene and they aren't really configured in any way actually the hinge joint is on trying to get them as close to the center of our scene as possible and that's because we haven't connected any rigid bodies so in order to do that we first off need a reference to the link prefab that we just spawned to do that let's create a game object here let's call it our link and set it equal equal to our instantiated prefab we can then our get components on the link more specifically we want to get the hinge joint 2d on that link let's just call this joint by going link get component and the component that we want to get here is hinge joint to be called so now we have a reference to the hinge joint 2d on the generated link however we need to also of course go joint dot and then it's called connected rigid connected body there we go so we need to set the rigidbody they connect the rigid body of that joint equal to the previous rigid body in our chain now the first time we run through this that's going to be the hook the second time it's going to be the second element the third time it's going to be the third element and so on so we really need to go in here create a rigidbody 2d and let's just call this the previous RB and we're going to default this to be the hook ah wait okay so we need the hooks let's change this to game object and let's do dot getcomponent here because we need the rigid body of our hook here alright that's better and actually I think it's even cleaner if we just make our hook a rigidbody2d I think we can go ahead and do that so we don't need to use any getcomponent so the first time we run through previous rigid bodies is going to be equal to our hook and so when we set the connected body off by joint we set it equal to the hook directly then after that we can set previous rigid body equal to the rigid body of the joint that we're currently looking at so we'll go link get component of type rigidbody 2d and so each time we go through it's going to set the previous rigidbody equal to the connected rigidbody the connected rigidbody equal to the previous rigidbody and it's then going to update the previous rigidbody so this is going to run seven times and set up seven connection links let's try and see if that works and let's just make sure that we don't need to update anything here yeah okay so we need to drag in the hook again because we changed the type so now when we hit play voila yes things are indeed working however are connected anger is down here for some reason not working but you can see that we now have links where nope nope not working not working at all so what did we do wrong here previous rigid body equals link does get component with your body while am I missing guys equal to th should be equal to hook here should be a good to the link or the rigid body of the current link I believe that's fine am I missing something hmm so the first time our rigid body should it be equal to the hook because we want the first rid your body or the first link in our chain to be connected to the hook the next link should be connected to arm the first link and so the first time it's going to run through it's going to set joint are connected oh there we go yeah alright this should be previous with your body there we go thank you and yes the chat is now calling me stupid thanks guys so of course we did not want this to be equal to hook every time instead we want this to be equal to the previous rigid body in the chain cool so now we can go and hit play and hopefully this time there we go so the first one here is connected to the rope the second one is connected to the hook and now each link element in the chain is connected to the previous one so this one is connected to that one this one is connected to that one and it keeps going that's super cool because what we can now do if we just go ahead and select all of these links here we can go into our connected anger and set that equal to minus 0.3 on the Y and voila we have a chain cool so let's just do that inside of our link on a prefab here we can simply go and set the connected anchor to negative point 3 on the Y and now when we play by default it's just going to work so that's awesome and we can actually go in here and manipulate these elements if I take the last link in the chain here and move that around you can see the chain updating in real time and they might have some weird behavior and yes that is to be expected considering just how easy easily we set this up but it is working and especially when we add something heavy towards the end of the chain here this is going to look fairly realistic also if you don't want this to be kind of comprised of a bunch of individual links what you could do is use a line renderer to draw lines between each of these points that would actually make that look quite a bit more like rope but I'm going for the clear minimalistic style here so yeah this is what would you all right so thanks for helping me debug that so I think it's time for a sip of water just so I don't get too dried out in the throat and let me see if everything is working other than people really spamming a lot about my stupidity before everything is looking good so the next thing that we want to do is connect our weight at the end of the chain and if we have multiple chains well then we want to connect multiple boy then we want to connect all of them to the same weight to do that we first off have to go ahead and add the weight so let's drag in the weights right here and what I'm going to do is simply add a component this is going to be a rigidbody2d and this is going to be dynamic because we wanted to be simulated in our physics space we also want a mass of say 8 they learn your drag of say 0.1 and an angular drag of say point 1 as well now when we hit play we should see that that just Falls right away now what we could do if we try and hit play now is we could add a hinge joint to our weight here I pause the game just to be able to do this we could then connect the last part of a link to that hinge drawing and we can set the connected anchor anchor by disabling Auto configure here to the same negative 0.3 on the Y and now you should see the Walla or chain is connected to our weight so that is actually all we need to do through script is at runtime add a hinge joint for each rope that we find and connect the last part of that rope so to do that let's go ahead and create a script that sits on the weight and let's just call it the weight script and let's double click that to open it up in visual studio and in here let's create a method that does exactly that so let's go ahead and delete the two using tags at the top delete our to default methods let's create a public we want this to be public because we actually want our ropes to access our weight in order to do this and we could make it a public void called say on set or maybe connect rope end there we go and we of course want to pass something in here and the thing that we want to pass in is a rigidbody2d that is going to be the end rigidbody so let's just call it in our B so this is of course the rigidbody component of the last part of our chain so that would be this one so what we can now do is using this in rigidbody we could go ahead and call add component on the game object in order to add a hinge joint 2d and yes we do want a hinge joint for each rope in our scenes or if we have four ropes we want four hinge joints that are affecting the weight in each their direction with each their force so um each time we call this we want to add a hinge joint and we can store this in a variable so it's of course going to be of type hinge joint 2d we can call it joint and set it equal to our new component we can then access our joint and what we want to of course change here is the connected body we want to set that equal to the end of our chain which we will make sure to pass in here as an argument and we can also set up some other properties here so we want to go join anchor and we want to set this to vector 2.0 so we want that to be zero zero on both the X axes remember that our hinge joint here on our weight should be zero zero on the anchor zero on the X connected angry and then minus 0.3 on the Y connected Angra actually we could maybe give it a bit more room on our weight in particular because it's a bit bigger than the rest of the links but we'll have a look at that in a second so now we can go join dot and then it's connected anchor and this we can set equal to a new vector to where the first part our xaxis is zero and the second point our yaxis is our going to say be negative 0.3 or we could make this a big a bit bigger we could also make it into a variable that we can easily configure let's do that so let's make a public float here and this is going to be our on say distance from chain or distance from chain and something like that I like to be very specific in my naming of these variables even though they might have ridiculously long names that I'm never going to get forget what what does so that's the best part and let's say that equal to actually let's just try something like point six of course negative point six but if we just say point stakes here then we can put negative distance from chain and there I think that's cleaner when we now save this and then go into the rope we of course need to call it and we only need to call this on the very last link and so what we do is we check if I live our value that what the index of the element that we're currently looking at is less than links it means that or links minus one actually so if the element we're currently looking at the index of the element we're currently looking at which is first going to be 0 then 1 then 2 all the way up to 6 is less than links minus 1 so it's going to be true for all links except the last one because 0 or 0 is less than 6 1 is less than 6 2 is less than 6 except for 6 and so the very last element here whoops the very last element here arm is going to not meet this requirement and so it's going to call the else statement instead so for all of these links until the last one we are going to set our previous rigid body equal to the current rigid body and for the last one only we'll go ahead and say arm find our weight we could either do that using find object of type or we could go in here and actually create a reference with which I think we're going to do is let's create a public weight and let's call this one weight and then down here we simply go weight dot arm connect rope end and we pass it in our link getcomponent rigidbody2d so whoops rigidbody2d so the rigid body of the link that we just set up boom all right so now that when now when we generate our rope we're going to go through generate all the link parts for the standard ones we're just going to set them up by connecting them to each other and then for the last one we're going to call connect rope end on the weight and we're going to pass in the rigid body then on the weight we'll go ahead and link that rigid body as the connected body on a weights joint instead of all of our settings there so now when we hit play or at least when we go into unity and select our rope drag in our weight and then hit play we should see okay so that's quite a bit of distance it's kind of unexpected amount of distance try point three on that see what that looks like I don't know what's giving us rich this much trouble oh I know why so under our joint we of course also need to make sure to set our anchors and what is it anchor autoconfigure connected anchor to false we does we did that manually on all the other components here we need to do it through script so just make sure to say that defaults or unity is going to try and calculate some stuff for you and we don't want it to do that let's now set our distance from chain and back to 0.6 and hit play and yay our chain is working and now it's actually really really easy to just go in here and add more ropes with simply duplicate our rope we move it over and we bump or we increase or lower the amount of links so this is a bit further away so let's give it more links let's try 12 for that one and it's going to be more than climbing and there you go and so now we can actually start having a look at cutting these ropes and let me show you how easy this is in fact all we need to do is go in select a certain part of the rope let's say this one and in order to cut the rope we simply delete it there we go and now we have rope swinging and it's cutting and everything is great hallelujah I just I love this effect so much because something about ropes feel really math intensive and they can be can be but unity just makes it so easy with hinge joints and it's just also fun because it feels so organic you never really know how a rope is going to act at least not these ones because they're weird so on yeah and the chest success as well that's good cool so now let's go ahead and cut up our chains to do that we need to register whether or not we hit them with our mouse to do that we'll need a Collider on the link so that we can cast out a raise to find out if we hit the collider let's go and find each part of our link here which is generated from this prefab and here we can go ahead and create a new circle Collider 2d and for the circle Collider let's just move this into the scene so we can see what's going on I want to increase the radius a little bit make it a tiny bit bigger than it needs to be I think that's good and let's not now hit or mark it as a trigger and then hit apply now we can remove this from our scene and we should now see that when you hit play and go into a scene here and select all of our links they all have our colliders so that's perfect what we can then do is go and create a new script let's set this on a separate object an empty object reset the transform in that and let's call this empty object something like hmm rope cutter I wanted to call it knife but I thought I might get flagged on you choose something for doing that let's move this to the top and let's add a component called rope cutter again csharp create net all that jazz let's double click it to open it up in visual studio and now on this one let's go ahead and delete the two using text as always let's delete these dark method we don't need that but we actually need the update for this one and what we want to do inside of our update is check if input get Mouse down don't get mouse button and the button that we want to check for is 0 meanness meaning left mouse button so 0 is left mouse button 1 is middle Mouse and 2 is right click or is it 1 right click mailmouse I shouldn't be teaching that if I don't even remember myself let's check the docs so umm 0 is definitely leftclick so if we click the left mouse button but then we want to go ahead and fire out a rave to check whether or not we hit a part of the chain where we're currently clicking to do that we first off need to get a ray cast hit 2d and let's just call this hit and it's going to store all the information about our ray and we'll set this equal to physics 2d got ray cast and we want to cast out a ray using camera main dot and this is going to be screen to world point and we want to get the world point of our mouse position so we'll go in put that mouse position and we then want to say comma vector 2.0 yes so basically what we're doing here is we are spawning a ray at the point of our mouse position so at on the z axis that's going to be 0 and then it's going to be wherever we click with our mouse and we don't actually want this raid to go anywhere and that's why we write vector to that 0 here we simply use the Ray kind of SA point is there anything that collides with the rate at this given point because we don't need to do any shooting with longer Ray's we just need to check at the point of impact so that's why we write it this way and we can then go ahead and check if hit dot Collider it's not equal to null so we if we've actually hit something well then we can check if hit dot tag whoops hit Collider tag it's equal to let's call it link we'll go ahead and create that tag in a second well then we've hit a certain part of a chain we've hit a link and we can go in here and destroy our hitch Collider game object you can destroy that link and that's going to cut up a room and that's all we need to do that's everything so now we can go inside of unity and we can find our link and we can go in here and add a tag the tag that we want to add here is linked and then for our link we can make sure to assign that tag you could go ahead and assign it to the hook as well if you want to be able to cut ropes at the very top here where the anchor is but I don't think that's needed I think it's better if we can only cut a rope along on the places that we can actually see it what I also want to do is make sure that this hook is always the need okay so it it's not too important for the hook here actually because it doesn't have a spare in it right but I want to make sure that our links it's always drawn underneath everything else let's go in here and change the audio layer to negative one let's also make sure that our weight is always drawn on top so let's change the order in layer two plus one cool so now when we hit play and if we go and try and click one of these links yes we have slicing so now we can cut the ropes any way that we want to and if you find that sometimes is misses when you try and cut a rope simply go into one of the links here and increase the radius to something say point I don't know point one eight it's going to be plenty I think far I taste and that should make sure that you can just kind of drag your mouse across and it's going to remove one link each time now we go that's pretty much all we needed for this game from here you can go and create levels by simply moving around ropes and using the building scene switching tools in order to switch between them you can add collectables that are rewarded whenever they get hit by the weight that's simply adding a Collider to the weight and then adding some kind of trigger to the collectible and then having something accrue once you do that and then also have some way of maybe put a frog in there to check if the ball reaches the end and if it does put up some kind of in screen that displays a score all this stuff is something I feel we've covered in in other videos another live stream so it's something that you should be able to pretty easily apply to this one so now you can just go ahead and go nuts I mean this is super fun and if you want to say remove the entire chain and not just cut it where we do what you can do is go in here and you can destroy instead of destroying hit collided our game object with them to destroy hit cool or it hit that transform dot parent that's the entire rope dart game object so we send we call destroy on that instead and whoops let me just try and save that and now when we play and try and slice a rope it's just going to get rid of the entire room oh and that also deletes the anchor but if you want you can just go ahead and leave the anger as a separate object or some kind of parent object and then have it delete everything else it's totally up to you what you could also do is go in here and kind of do both so in the very beginning here it's going to destroy only the arm the part of the chain that we hit and then after say two seconds it's going to destroy the entire rope and then you can have it fade out using some kind of alpha animation so that's what they do in the original game I know is is everything actually disappears after a second or so but you can actually see on the rope being cut so it's it's totally up to you you could also go ahead and remove all masts on the chain so that after it's being cut it doesn't have any physical influence on on the weight itself there's lots of stuff you can do so I feel that's pretty much everything that we needed to cover in this video I just want to go ahead and try and create really really large chain let's see we can select this one let's try and create something with forty links see what happens oh now that's chaotic it actually works I was I'm surprised to see that this doesn't break in some way but I it actually behaves pretty well well it's so cool let's zoom out with the camera here let's see our huge chain working and nevermind the background all that's awesome I'm a huge fan of this you can now take the chain here let's drag it up here and see what happens look at it go oh that's so cool and we can splice this up in any way that we want to okay so as you can see there's plenty of fun to be had with this so I hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial part of this our video now we're going to switch over to a Q&A format so if you guys have any questions whatsoever write them to me in the chat and I will do my best to answer and also we'll have a look at some blue blue team Diaries stuff in just a second here so that's awesome so let me just switch over to chat format there we go and now you should be able to see the chat as well and let me start reading some questions here do I have a college degree no I do not please make a complete level with it I am sorry that's all we're going to be doing today but I will have the project file for you if you want to get it for yourself let me see couldn't you just disable them yeah of course you can disable them as well if you don't want to remove them completely that would be I would recommend putting some kind of animation that fades out the Alpha channel that would look pretty cool and in general I would probably recommend using a line renderer but if you want to learn more about line renderer so you should check out our I think the a few months ago but we did a live stream on kind of doing a acting to cool also called curve fever on replica and that's pretty cool so that that's using the new unity line renderer from five point six five point five I don't exactly remember when it was introduced but it's a lot better and you should be able to fairly easily apply it here simply have each game object act as a point in the line renderer and and which it should look cool I'm from Denmark how long have you been working on games I've been creating games pretty much my entire life or at least the live voice at least trying to but I've been working professionally with games since I started this channel very much which is five years ago something like that then maybe a year or two before that trying to kind of get into the whole thing but the channel here and I have pretty much grown together how did you learn programming that world oh thank you after all the mistakes I just made I made you think a program well well that's that's awesome you guys are too generous I I learn programming are from mostly unity tutorials back then it was well it depends on what you mean programming I've learned many different programming languages in both web and and other runtime languages and if you if you're talking about game development mostly in unity then it was YouTube tutorials and it's also my preferred work a way of learning back then it was tomato twinks that helped me get started how did you make the camera follow script and shrinking plan and I do not want to talk about that check out the source code it's it's on the Ludum dare a page and you can you can see for yourself it's not pretty do you have some secret knowledge as well a little bit I'm not a good see let's watch programmer but I can read most C++ codes because some of it gets really hairy but I feel I know my way around the language wouldn't be comfortable getting a job having to write C++ code but on a hobby level it's fine I guess let's see have I finished the university haven't even started so no I don't plan to go to university not at least not for now I'm having too much fun with this and I find that I can can do much more creative stuff this way and if I went to university so let's see can you actually make a living from mobile games you can but it's super tough the mobile game industry has kind of changed in the beginning when everyone was first getting into the app market it was really if you got an app on the App Store and if you got just a tiny bit featured you could make a lot of money on that that time is long long gone there are so many competing apps especially games now that cracking that market is just the most difficult thing ever you can definitely make a living creating games but you need contacts or you need budget and you need to create many games not just one having being able to live off of one game is rare just telling your heart is it still super fun though and I recommend you do it the source code you posted under is not working for me I'm sorry I don't know why that would be pretty sure I tested it it worked for me before then I'm using JUnit II 5.6 so I think you should make sure that you're using the same version I haven't heard any other complaints that it wasn't working so yeah I'm sorry I can't really troubleshoot that with you right now how do you get assets for games dev assets of course if you go to dev assets calm you can download free high quality asset packs pay what you want so you can choose the price and that means a minimum of price of zero but definitely awesome if you want to help support me in the artists that's a good place you and the asset store is a great place and yeah those are probably the two biggest ones that I can think of this let's see here isn't it extensive to live in Copenhagen yes Copenhagen this is an expensive city so yeah it is and not really much to say about that Copenhagen is just overall expensive do you code your own shaders do you think unity should implement a material node inspector like unreal engines so arm I do sometimes delve into the world of shader programming when I do it not pretty I've done a few successful shaders mostly I do it following some kind of tutorial but I feel now that I mostly do it out of habit because I'm not comfortable writing shaders but most of the time and I can do it without however especially since unity updated to the new standard shader there are some things that I haven't really rubbed my head around mostly because I get to do it so rarely but I think it's really fun to do I think that's really something really gratifying about creating code that directly affects graphics that's really fun and that's just so much creative stuff you can do which with shaders so I don't know why I haven't gotten into it more it's probably just because um you guys haven't been asking for it on the channel and most of what I do with unity is is for the channel in terms of grading a node editor that would be the coolest thing ever but then again there are some really good assets out there such as shader Forge that allow you to do that so as long as there is a method and this time there there is I don't think it should be that top priority at the moment definitely not I think the standard shader suits 99% of of what you need to do with with shaders I did pick up blender recently though ah got plenty I did start using blender again recently because I wanted to prepare for the series and also because I just think blender so so fun and I mean their node editor is just amazing so it is hard not to get envious of that but I really mean it's it's it's more of a fun thing than it's something that's really needed um thank you for the compliments by the way guys what programming language would you recommend for a beginner depends on what you want to do I would always recommend the programming language that gets you or that allows you to do what you want to do the quickest because I think the most important thing for beginners is capturing their interest and showing them that programming is not books and it's not API programming is creative and it's something that allows you to make something and so I would always say if you want to make a webpage start with HTML you can get something up and running right away if you want to make something sciency or if you want to make automated tasks or anything like that start with Python if you want to make games maybe start with unity or maybe not maybe start with something easier like JavaScript or um like regular JavaScript not unity script or maybe game maker so totally depends on what you want to do but I do believe that unity is a great tool for showing how creative you can be with always programming I am 20 years old ah why unity over unreal no particular reason because I don't really favor unity over unreal okay that's a lie I do favor unity over and rely on quite a few things but I think that whenever it comes to what engineer should choose it totally depends on what game you want to make so unity over unreal is just a matter of me thinking that unity fits the types of games that I make most of the time I've never actually embarked upon a project where I thought one wheel would be a better guess especially because most of the stuff that I do is done by me alone when it comes to game projects and if I had a bigger team I would probably say otherwise what's your favorite game have one will Duvall craft counterstrike I can know one of the big tiles I think um exactly unity and unreal both have their good and bad points let's let's tell you right let's see for a web developer and designer mainly using javascript CSS HTML sometimes PHP which is the best program to start making games I'd like to make some simple but fun games in my spare time unity I know I can use chaos and unity to yeah I think if you have experience with web development pick up unity I think game maker is probably the big contester when it comes to quickly getting into making games using some kind of a engine with an interface not that you want to go the riot route of clips or anything like that but I would always recommend picking up unity then just because javascript is going to be very familiar to you and allows you to not so much focus on language but more focus on what's unity specific what does it mean making a game also kind of get you in the groove of managing assets and setting up scenes and levels and what all these different dials mean without the big overhead so yeah I would suggest you in any video definitely um let's see am I ever going to do a gaming stream at least the stream that isn't tutorial related maybe for this stream I actually thought about creating or making an entire stream where I only play Ludum dare games that you guys have made or other games that you might want me to play and that could be super fun to do I want to play what you make and see what you are able to do especially maybe if the game was inspired by a tutorial of mine that would be I mean it's always awesome to see the what you put out there it's actually maybe helping someone so that could be really fun to do and with that let's play some games let's do it so I'm going to jump on let's see here let's change the layout again they are just changing guys so let's go to LG Jem calm and I am going to log in here and I'm going to do that off screen um and I don't remember the login well I did it's great so here the note if you don't know Ludum dare I say game development competition where you get 48 hours to create a game from scratch using only selfmade assets and it's super fun look that's me Hey haha that's so cool I didn't know that these were showing up in on the Ludum dare a side that's fun huh anyway it's a 48 hours way that you get to make a game from scratch using some kind of theme and the theme this time was small world and I made a game called shrinking planet and it looks like this and it allows you to drive around the small planet while trying to avoid meteors and I found this fire icon and it's gotta be super cool and you can go ahead and download it I'm just going to throw a link in the description here to those who want to check that out you can play it in the web browser let's just actually try and maybe have a quick play here and let me see if I can get some desktop all your working I think I think maybe that it's streaming the audio but I really have no idea let's try and hit play here and it does black in the beginning a tiny bit in whoops in the browser here and you can also see the grass shader is nearly as nice in the browser I don't know why I played in a nice browser I think I already have it installed actually fit through this write shrinking planet no no yes maybe shrinking planet bilks windows x86 there we go cool it's booting up now yeah I wanted to show you guys to grass shader it's the best part it's year I made it using a tutorial by Ellen Saucony you can see how much better that looks now so I have no idea if audio is coming through let me know is that that's working if not it's not too important just wanted to maybe get that set up soon because some of the games I thought this dude and I really had really nice audio that I thought should be showcased if not you can always watch my video on kind of behind the scenes stuff so I did a a not so much a postmortem but more of a making us video on this particular game it's it's up now on the YouTube channel go check that out and the cool thing is look how well we did guys tada we were number one in theme yes celebration and the white balance on my camera is the love I feel eighty eight eighty HD today hyper it's probably because I've had to do so much boring work so this week I'm pretty excited to to be doing some live streaming and we we got number eight in graphics and um numbers 13 overall so I'm super happy about this I mean it's a huge improvement from my last submission first of all and it's also just getting number one in a category it's so cool ah so I was really really excited about this um I think some of the judgments here are not really fair I don't think necessarily that I did that well in innovation and I definitely think um that my humor rating should have been lower as well because I had no jokes in there whatsoever so I I think some of these are a bit too good but I'm happy about it I shouldn't complain but yeah so and and the feedback that you guys left was just awesome I mean look at all these comments and a lot of really good feedback as well I spoke to Sebastian as well he also left a comment here Sebastian leg if you know him personally BRR he did a he had some really nice feedback I think one of the main problems with this game it was also something that I wanted to add but simply hadn't didn't have the time is the fact that you can just drive straight and then not get hit by meteors for 10 20 seconds that's the problem I should have some kind of targeting that sometimes put a meteor in front of the players or he has to react that would make it a lot better also feel that sometimes it's a bit too fast paced and it feels unfair when you simply aren't able to dodge a media or even though you were trying your hardest so it's also something that I should have a look at but overall I was really happy with the submission and if you didn't watch the last stream ah Sophia my lovely fiancee um did a game as well called me 'dom so look at this so here you go that was her first Ludum dare a submission and she did well as well for first submission she got a number 66 in humor that's pretty cool I also really liked her interpretation of the team actually thought that 120 wasn't enough for that because her theme interpretation is awesome I think pretty much everyone did something with small planets including myself and I don't really think it's fair that I got more in theme but but alright it's I guess it's the voting system so shouldn't complain but you can check that out as well I'll leave a link in the chat if you want to go play that as well so yeah guys um if you have a little diary submission that you want me to play or a game that you made using one of my tutorials keep it a little diary here in the beginning maybe definitely through it in the in the description I want to check it out this one here called battlehex it sounds cool oh no this looks complicated yes let's try it out and oh you didn't get enough ratings hmm one rating tsys I'm sorry download the game on your chair let's do that dddd oh it's a WebGL perfect those are the best points I'm just gonna add it to the water while it's loading okay so the goal is to either remove all enemy pawns or find the chest with gold this game is meant to be played with two players on one screen oh do you want to join in awesome I've no idea what to do we should be two players and I don't know how this is what's going on okay I think this is you now it's some kind of I have no idea to tell us what to do here come Jane let's sit closer okay I guess I'll try to press over you oh okay so you can I think you should place units down here but you can only place at the beginning so it's like it's like chess all right and I guess the bluest water in the ground is grass I think you should hit okay now without knowing anything let's click to choose a pond and child to move to right click and drag or vast keys to move the camera all right so I can choose a pawn now oh let's see and it's about getting the gold I think okay my turn yeah I'm going aggressively for the gold when you start you have to play three punch on the first row of the board and then click ok button right top right corner this will start a gaming reason and then to attack an enemy spawn I open the chest you have to strike backwards okay yes I'll do that okay this is going to be easy we place a chest sometimes you know sparring on the channel good yeah I'm going to be used to this one I'm sorry can i huh you have to strike backwards well so you have to get in front of it I don't I want to do this can I can I do this now nope how do I get the cold yes yes I did it boom one zero no no no my chest so I think some some things that are really working for this game are the overall feel of the movement I mean the controls are snappy and it's clear to see where the where the units eye on what's going on I don't necessarily need thing that you need to be able to control the camera I think maybe just a more topdown view would be fine kind of like and chest you don't really see the ability to move the camera there also the music is working one thing that I do find a bit weird is kind of reading how the environment affect the decision you make I find right now it's mostly maybe because I'm not too good at it just a matter of racing to the nearest chest and I don't see many layers of strategy I don't really see how the colors of the board affect your okay so that's pretty annoying okay so that's actually really annoying um so yeah overall cool game yeah shouldn't have done that I'm gonna get you now okay and game over got the gold yes thanks for joining in it okay cool so I'm going to put back the black screen but everything still works Cole I'm going to close down the game here if you guys have any more games I would love to try them out just throw a link in in the chat and we'll have look also I will readjust the white balance on my camera here because it's it's bad it's really red let's see if we can make that better that's a bit better good enough so yeah throw me links let me see you guys had a bunch of links last time so I hope that you guys throw me something this time as well I just have to update my chat here as well because it's it's for some reason is just stuck cold so toniest tony has a game as well it's called what's it called miniature adventure oh that's cool so you didn't get enough ratings of flood it was a huge problem with duda at this time no one was getting ratings and it's because the rating system got out so so late and yeah everything just got pushed pushed back but okay so this looks like something on that I can figure out how to do made in a in Gia's with my custom engine that's cool man next to begin all right I'm in bored hell yeah loving the music already failing but loving the music I don't know if you guys are able to hear this music but it's awesome oh you get made smaller oh it's so cool right God's the spikes which I said to do Jesus okay can do this this is your own engine that's awesome well I'm loving this and so here everything's smaller well that's really cool one thing I would probably do for this is I'll make sure to swim in the camera a bit more once the our player gets small I find it's a bit too far away maybe in order to be able to see all the action but I really like the shrinking mechanic also one thing that you can do is maybe interpolate between the two sizes because right now it just instantly gets small it would be cool if it kind of gradually zoomed in instead but these are just small smaller points okay so we're going down oh oh well that's so cool ah I think I failed yeah I've got oh yes but the music is perfect I feel like if the Leno is superhero something oh ok so that felt unfair there you go pretty much have to make sure that always lands on the top one there it's not nice dying and not really feeling that you have a stay in Y trends one more time okay this time I'll get it stand there go here go there oh I have to go to the other side Jesus okay we do the case stand here now go here and there we go yes perfect level complete Oh No that doesn't look right Oh see I have to go to the other side here this is super cool time racing and with your minute yourself ah to be fast no not gonna make it I just made it all it's so cold okay so this are these these levels is falling levels ah the worst I can never do it my reactionary skills of way too bad for this so anyway I don't know have to do it ah see not gonna happen feel old when I get these levels yep this is why I'm giving up awesome game man really enjoying it I think the graphics are nice minimalistic they do what they should and yeah oh well good game well done let's see let's see if there are any other links here to try out we may be a trial run one more didn't get much most votes so that you can play tennis again it's my first interest I hope you enjoyed all right we'll check it out asteroid shooter oh that looks cool I believe I saw this actually on there download there we go and just wait for this turn on download and install see so this is a game by ah oh where is it Mick well L mm final build yes please let's just put this on the desktop clean up in a sec okay so this is probably going to be the last game guys then we'll wrap up the stream because also have to kind of process all of the footage and upload stuff to github and such but it I had a blast that's for sure so let's try and coconut asteroid chew here let's do a windowed one here too and small new size choose that one yes that's perfect play see what this is about play game arrow keys to control alright you can do that oh yes okay I get it right away okay so the controls here really nice it's really it's actually fairly easy to hit the asteroid to think something about the speed is well balanced really like are the exploding graphics as well really really simple particles but they do that job and now we get big asteroids it's a good thing that you have health bars in here what you could also do is maybe just have the asteroids shrink instead each time you hit them that way it gets more and more difficult the more you play or on the morass the more you hit the asteroid kind of have chunks follow them I really like how you have the asteroid split up into multiple ones that's kind of adds another layer but I think you could do that with helps us walk maybe but ya don't know why this didn't we'd get that much many votes this is an awesome game as well oh no you're perfect so I mean a simple thing that you could add on this type of game I joined game over it's some kind of upgrade menu I think this is one of those games that could really keep people hooked if you get a way to upgrade your planet up get more guns in there get health upgrades shields automatic turret turrets nuclear bombs that kind of destroy everything on the screen stuff like that you could also have it so that you shoot up grapes around the screen so if you just take your time maybe a few seconds to shoot something on the screen that business asteroid in return you get some kind of bonus powerup so that's something that I would probably add there but really well done so I believe that is all that we are going to do today so that's pretty much the end of the livestream guys I hope you enjoyed it I really did as always and yeah if you want to watch this live stream it will be up later on YouTube along with the github project so you can download everything
