00:04 - I've been thinking of something that I
00:06 - could say to try and break the ice but I
00:09 - think I'll just go ahead and do
00:16 - it all right now that's out of the way
00:18 - hello everyone it's been a while I hope
00:20 - you've all been well the last time we
00:22 - uploaded a video was over 3 years ago
00:25 - and I think it's safe to say that a lot
00:27 - has happened since then both in the
00:29 - world and in The Game Dev industry
00:31 - personally I've been taking a break from
00:33 - video games and to be honest I wasn't
00:35 - really planning on making any new videos
00:37 - anytime soon I think for a while that
00:40 - some of the harsh realities of the video
00:41 - game industry had taken away some of the
00:43 - joy that I used to feel when making
00:45 - games from the lack of unionization in
00:48 - Tria to the real challenge of keeping an
00:50 - indie game Studio afloat I think there's
00:53 - an ever increasing pressure on
00:55 - developers as someone who started in the
00:57 - Game Dev space very young with simple
00:59 - and probably naive ideas of what it
01:01 - means to make video games these reties
01:04 - simply took it out of me for a while but
01:06 - recently that changed a bit not because
01:09 - I discovered some cure that will
01:10 - magically make these issues disappear
01:13 - because unfortunately I haven't and they
01:15 - won't but simply because I saw something
01:18 - that made me excited about making games
01:20 - again in fact you could say that it's
01:22 - been a game Cher pun intended and I know
01:25 - that a lot of you feel the same I'm of
01:27 - course talking about open source let me
01:29 - explain I've long been a huge fan of
01:32 - blender if you don't know blender is an
01:34 - incredibly powerful and now very popular
01:36 - 3D Graphics tool it has capabilities in
01:39 - modeling sculpting UV mapping hugely
01:42 - powerful rendering and the list just
01:44 - goes on and the thing about blender is
01:47 - that it's 100% free
02:04 - when I started using blender it was
02:05 - still pretty small and not even close to
02:08 - comparing to the mighty industry
02:10 - standard Autodesk Suite but since then
02:12 - it has become a huge contender in the
02:14 - world of 3D Graphics preferred by many
02:17 - professionals as well but how can
02:18 - something that is free ever compete with
02:21 - a hugely complicated software suite that
02:23 - cost thousands of dollars in
02:25 - subscription fees well at least part of
02:27 - the answer is that blender is what we
02:28 - call free and open Source software also
02:31 - known as Foss this means that instead of
02:33 - a company owning and controlling the
02:35 - software with a private codebase the
02:37 - software is publicly owned and has a
02:40 - public and open code base that anyone
02:42 - can access and contribute to if you
02:44 - don't like something about the software
02:46 - or you would like to add a feature to it
02:48 - you can simply download a copy of it and
02:50 - modify it to suit your needs and then if
02:52 - you like the result you can reupload it
02:54 - to see if other people would find it
02:55 - useful too perhaps merging your changes
02:58 - into the main program one of the great
03:00 - benefits of this is that it helps ensure
03:02 - that the software development is driven
03:04 - by the needs of the people who use it
03:06 - it's a hugely Democratic way of
03:08 - organizing development on top of this
03:10 - open source makes it possible to utilize
03:12 - volunteer work and donations to fund
03:14 - development this means that the software
03:16 - is free from ties to any single entity
03:19 - and makes it possible for anyone to use
03:21 - it without having to pay subscription
03:22 - fees or owing Away part of their revenue
03:25 - and open source is actually not as niche
03:27 - as you might think Linux for example
03:29 - went from a small hobbyist tool in the
03:31 - early '90s to powering Enterprise server
03:34 - systems also so many of the completely
03:37 - mainstream products of our time are
03:39 - built on top of Linux such as software
03:41 - for cars televisions and all Android
03:43 - phones it also Powers most of the
03:46 - internet and the world stock exchanges
03:48 - so open source is already an integral
03:51 - part of the digital world we live in
03:52 - today now I mentioned that I started
03:54 - making games when I was still very young
03:57 - but looking back it feels like the
03:58 - industry was as well in just the past
04:01 - decade thirdparty engines like unity and
04:03 - unreal have become huge and Industry
04:05 - standard a big difference from before
04:07 - where game studios would develop and use
04:09 - their own in-house engines also Indie
04:12 - development has gone from something that
04:14 - very few people even knew about to a
04:16 - huge Community where hobbyists and
04:18 - professionals alike publish successful
04:20 - game titles largely because of how
04:22 - accessible these third party Indians
04:24 - have become and the game industry as a
04:26 - whole has become the largest
04:28 - entertainment industry in the world
04:29 - World far surpassing music and movies
04:32 - put together now this is a lot of change
04:35 - and not in a lot of time and while huge
04:38 - growth like this of course creates
04:39 - issues I think it's important to
04:41 - remember that it also brings a lot of
04:43 - positives perhaps most importantly
04:45 - making games has never been more
04:47 - accessible than it is now and also large
04:49 - open source projects like a modern game
04:52 - engine require a lot of manpower to
04:54 - develop something that wouldn't have
04:55 - been possible with the small Game Dev
04:57 - communities of just 10 years ago in in
04:59 - fact just before taking a break from
05:01 - gamedev I was aware of a few open-
05:03 - Source initiatives but I didn't think
05:05 - that they were viable alternatives to
05:07 - commercial engines but holy wow A lot
05:10 - has happened since to convince me
05:11 - otherwise and huge props to the Game Dev
05:14 - Community for making that happen first
05:16 - of all a bunch of new engines have
05:18 - popped up and just like with blender
05:20 - previously Niche software is starting to
05:22 - gain massive followings with many
05:24 - contributing their time and donating to
05:26 - hire full-time developers the largest
05:29 - example of this this being Gau gdau is a
05:32 - free and fully open- Source game engine
05:34 - that a lot of developers have recently
05:35 - turned to and the timing really couldn't
05:37 - be better for this gdau has actually
05:39 - been around for a while but in March
05:41 - last year gdau 4 was released which was
05:44 - a huge rewrite of the engine in my eyes
05:46 - making it a great choice for a lot of
05:48 - game projects and of course Gau is now
05:50 - riding on a wave of new users developers
05:54 - and a huge influx of donations to the
05:56 - Gau Development Fund I've been turning
05:58 - around with it for the past few few
05:59 - months and I've been well loving it
06:02 - while many parts of the engan of course
06:04 - have a ways to go it is overall much
06:06 - further than I was expecting and perhaps
06:08 - more importantly for me it forced me to
06:10 - learn new things and reminded me of why
06:12 - I fell in love with making games in the
06:14 - first place now as for the title of this
06:16 - video I'm of course in no position to
06:19 - predict the future of the huge industry
06:21 - that now is game development but I do
06:24 - think that part of making that future
06:26 - the best that it can be is to realize
06:28 - just that game development is huge now
06:31 - and while this of course brings a lot of
06:33 - negatives it also means that there are
06:35 - more game developers than ever before
06:37 - who all share a love for the same thing
06:39 - and that perhaps a part of this future
06:42 - is software that is open source
06:44 - democratically owned and Community
06:46 - funded now I want to be totally clear
06:48 - here I'm by no means encouraging you to
06:51 - stop using third party engines like
06:53 - Unity Onre or game maker nor am I saying
06:56 - that you should all use Kau or any other
06:58 - open source engine for for that matter
07:00 - I've been using Unity for many years and
07:02 - made well over 400 videos on it so it's
07:05 - safe to say that I like the software in
07:07 - the end the game engine is a tool and
07:09 - you have to use the tool that is right
07:10 - for you and your project all I hope to
07:13 - do with this video is to inform you that
07:14 - there are many engines out there and
07:16 - hopefully to inspire you to think of the
07:18 - possibilities of what can be achieved
07:20 - through different ways of organizing
07:22 - software at GDC last year one of the
07:24 - co-founders of the Gau engine Juan netki
07:27 - gave a talk titled Gau as an open open
07:29 - ecosystem with a lot of sharp
07:31 - observations about open source in The
07:33 - Game Dev industry it goes into detail
07:35 - about how open source can be beneficial
07:37 - for the industry as a whole and I highly
07:39 - recommend you check it out so in the
07:42 - spirit of Open Source we'll be releasing
07:44 - some new videos on Gau I've been hard at
07:47 - work learning the engine and while I'm
07:48 - no expert yet and things are a bit
07:50 - different this time around there's no
07:52 - team there are no Patron supporters we
07:54 - aren't in an office in fact we're
07:56 - recording this from our home
08:00 - I with the help of Sophia have done our
08:02 - best to create a couple of videos on the
08:04 - most essential parts of gdau the first
08:06 - video will be a Mega tutorial on making
08:09 - your very first gaming gdau and should
08:11 - be out next week the second one will be
08:13 - a complete overview of the GD script
08:15 - language and will be out within a month
08:17 - we really can't wait to share them with
08:19 - you and we thought that since so many
08:21 - things are different this time around we
08:23 - might as well try something new so the
08:25 - new videos will be in Danish
08:37 - [Music]
08:48 - hello everyone and Welcome to our first
08:50 - video on Gau

Cleaned transcript:

I've been thinking of something that I could say to try and break the ice but I think I'll just go ahead and do it all right now that's out of the way hello everyone it's been a while I hope you've
