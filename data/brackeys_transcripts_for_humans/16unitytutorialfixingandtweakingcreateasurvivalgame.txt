00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to the 16th
00:06 - video in our survival game series done
00:08 - by brackets I am the CEO of trackies and
00:11 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:13 - at all of the borrowing stuff we're
00:15 - gonna take a look at tweaking different
00:18 - mistakes and fixing some stuff so I know
00:22 - it's not that exciting but it has to be
00:25 - done in the next video I promise we are
00:28 - going to take a look at scripting door
00:30 - functionality to a logic so we can have
00:32 - stuff that opens up and also we will
00:37 - implement some GUI to tell the player
00:40 - which buttons he needs to press in order
00:42 - to open it so that's really exciting and
00:46 - it's on its way I promise now as always
00:51 - I've opened up unity and the first thing
00:54 - I want to take a look at is that here
00:58 - under the scripts folder i've gone ahead
01:00 - and dragged the advanced AI from the
01:02 - last tutorial under the scripts folder
01:06 - also i have renamed the raycast shooting
01:10 - with capitals and the weapon switching
01:12 - with capitals and also the spending
01:15 - Crouch from the sprinting tutorial and
01:18 - the crouching tutorial I've gone ahead
01:21 - and drag that into our game also and you
01:25 - can just go ahead and watch the two
01:27 - videos if you want to learn how this was
01:29 - made
01:30 - and it's also included in the assets
01:32 - pack and so that's really awesome in the
01:36 - spinning video we take a look at making
01:38 - the sprinting and in the crouching we
01:40 - take a look at making the crouching and
01:42 - also merging the two so on that's how
01:45 - they work now let's go back to the
01:49 - assets folder and we can go ahead and
01:52 - delete this sprinting and crouching
01:54 - folder here it's the one I used for
01:57 - making the tutorial and yeah awesome so
02:02 - let's go ahead and dive into the first
02:06 - fix I want to select the player and drag
02:12 - in the sprinting
02:13 - ouch there we go and when we had play
02:19 - the game starts playing and when I press
02:22 - see he crouches and when I hold down
02:25 - shift he will sprint so that's working
02:29 - and now let's go ahead and fix the
02:32 - crosshair because you might not have
02:36 - noticed it but the crosshair isn't
02:38 - exactly in the center of the scene it's
02:41 - a little far to the right and a little
02:44 - of fine upwards so if we go ahead and
02:49 - select it we can make sure that it's
02:51 - centered so under the GUI texture under
02:56 - the pixel inset you can see that the x
02:58 - and y are set to zero and now if I you
03:02 - might therefore you might wonder why
03:05 - isn't it centered it's because these two
03:09 - values define the position of the anchor
03:15 - point and the anchor point of the GUI it
03:20 - doesn't have to be in the center with
03:24 - this GUI it is in the lower left-hand
03:30 - corner and so this right here is the
03:34 - center and to fix this we can take the
03:39 - width and the height of the object and
03:41 - divide it by 2 so we get half of the
03:45 - width and half of the height and then
03:49 - subtracted in the x and y values so if I
03:52 - write minus 8 in the X and minus 8 in Y
03:59 - we will now have the GUI centered in the
04:03 - screen so that's it for the GUI now
04:09 - let's move the enemy out of the way
04:12 - because we are not really in the need of
04:14 - an enemy right now so let's just move
04:17 - him over there
04:18 - and the final thing I want to fix in
04:21 - this video is the audio because until
04:25 - now we have had the friendly
04:27 - music playing in the town and the enemy
04:30 - territory playing in another audio zone
04:34 - over here by the enemy and these two
04:38 - audio files are as mentioned earlier not
04:41 - at all good for gaming and game creation
04:44 - they are too long and too large so they
04:51 - are really not optimized for what we're
04:53 - doing here so for now I just want to
04:55 - disable this they will still be included
04:58 - in the Aztecs asset pack so you can
05:00 - include them in your game if you want to
05:03 - though I'm not going to use them here at
05:07 - least not for now so I'll just disable
05:09 - the audio zone optional optimized - and
05:13 - I'll go into the audio zone optimized
05:16 - one and here I want to actually keep the
05:19 - audio zone though I want to change the
05:21 - auto clip audio clip because the
05:24 - friendly music is not something I want
05:26 - to use though I have found another piece
05:29 - of audio right here with an ambient
05:33 - sound of a town which we can use until
05:36 - we actually make all of the different
05:39 - little sounds around the town so let me
05:43 - just go ahead and play this so you can
05:46 - have a listen but first I have to enable
05:49 - my my speakers um so it gives me one
05:53 - second okay so I got my speaker's
05:56 - working and now let's have a listen keep
06:00 - in mind that this should only work as a
06:02 - background layer not something that
06:05 - should really stand out
06:15 - so you can hear some wind blowing you
06:18 - can use some people in the background
06:20 - and you can hear some parrots peeping so
06:25 - on that's basically it for the audio
06:27 - file let's just implement this by
06:29 - selecting the audio sound and then
06:32 - dragging in the sound ambience and one
06:37 - more thing if we go ahead and hit play
06:39 - now we can hear the town but it won't
06:45 - pan whenever we change our direction and
06:49 - where we look so let's go ahead and make
06:54 - sure that we can actually hear this by
06:57 - adjusting the pan level so let's make
07:03 - sure that the pan level is somewhat up
07:06 - there we can try to put it at max put it
07:09 - at 100
07:11 - and this will really give you some
07:14 - panning though I don't know if that's
07:18 - what you want you can get to decide that
07:21 - on your own one thing for sure though is
07:24 - that I want to pimp down the volume
07:26 - quite a bit so that it's only in the
07:32 - background awesome so that was basically
07:36 - it for this video I know it wasn't so
07:39 - exciting it's a little weak though all
07:41 - of this done hat all of this stuff had
07:44 - to be done next one we are going to take
07:47 - a look at making some doors open and
07:50 - close I hope you enjoyed the video and
07:52 - I'll see you in the next one

hello everyone and welcome to the 16th video in our survival game series done by brackets I am the CEO of trackies and in this video we're going to take a look at all of the borrowing stuff we're gonna take a look at tweaking different mistakes and fixing some stuff so I know it's not that exciting but it has to be done in the next video I promise we are going to take a look at scripting door functionality to a logic so we can have stuff that opens up and also we will implement some GUI to tell the player which buttons he needs to press in order to open it so that's really exciting and it's on its way I promise now as always I've opened up unity and the first thing I want to take a look at is that here under the scripts folder i've gone ahead and dragged the advanced AI from the last tutorial under the scripts folder also i have renamed the raycast shooting with capitals and the weapon switching with capitals and also the spending Crouch from the sprinting tutorial and the crouching tutorial I've gone ahead and drag that into our game also and you can just go ahead and watch the two videos if you want to learn how this was made and it's also included in the assets pack and so that's really awesome in the spinning video we take a look at making the sprinting and in the crouching we take a look at making the crouching and also merging the two so on that's how they work now let's go back to the assets folder and we can go ahead and delete this sprinting and crouching folder here it's the one I used for making the tutorial and yeah awesome so let's go ahead and dive into the first fix I want to select the player and drag in the sprinting ouch there we go and when we had play the game starts playing and when I press see he crouches and when I hold down shift he will sprint so that's working and now let's go ahead and fix the crosshair because you might not have noticed it but the crosshair isn't exactly in the center of the scene it's a little far to the right and a little of fine upwards so if we go ahead and select it we can make sure that it's centered so under the GUI texture under the pixel inset you can see that the x and y are set to zero and
