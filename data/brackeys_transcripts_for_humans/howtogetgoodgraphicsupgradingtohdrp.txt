With timestamps:

00:00 - so a while back we did a video on how to
00:01 - get good-looking Graphics in unity but
00:04 - since then there's been some major
00:05 - changes to how we work with Graphics in
00:07 - unity and at the center of these changes
00:09 - is a brand new rendering engine it's
00:12 - called the scriptable render pipeline or
00:14 - SRP for short SRP allows us to either
00:17 - choose a pre-made rendering pipeline
00:19 - provided by unity or to write our own C
00:22 - code to customize how things are
00:23 - rendered because SRP is so modular it
00:26 - can both be used for games that should
00:27 - run on lower-end devices and for games
00:29 - that Target AAA Hardware in this video
00:32 - we'll be working with hdrp or the
00:34 - highdefinition render pipeline we use
00:36 - hdrp whenever we want to achieve optimal
00:39 - rendering quality so in this video we'll
00:41 - turn this horrible looking scene into
00:43 - this just using hdrp also this video is
00:46 - sponsored by unity now before we get
00:48 - into it we've been working on some new
00:50 - designs for line of code and they are
00:53 - finally here woohoo
00:55 - wooho we work together with Blackthorn
00:58 - prod who is just an amazing art artist
01:00 - and game developer to create these four
01:02 - cool looking shirts I think my personal
01:04 - favorite is the hard one it's just so
01:06 - cute but that is not all we also have
01:08 - this really cool new design by Thea and
01:11 - a new game Jam one in collaboration with
01:13 - mm and on top of that we've gotten a lot
01:15 - of requests to bring these designs onto
01:17 - female fitted shirts so we've of course
01:20 - gone ahead and done that as well so
01:22 - simply visit lineof code. and use the
01:24 - coupon code shirt me up to get 10% off
01:27 - for the first week also if you're like
01:29 - me and absolutely love everything that
01:31 - black thornn Pro does he does have his
01:33 - own YouTube channel and it's even on em
01:36 - me with some beginner courses also
01:38 - before we get started special thanks to
01:39 - Jack jubert Andrew Keno John Shannon and
01:42 - infinity PPR for their support on Patron
01:44 - all right let's jump into the video so
01:46 - as you can see I've gone ahead and set
01:47 - up this simple example scene in here we
01:50 - have some models from the Mayan timble
01:52 - pack I'll of course have a link to where
01:53 - you can download these in the
01:54 - description I've also gone ahead and set
01:56 - up a few lights we have two directional
01:58 - lights as well as a few Point lights
02:00 - scattered around the scene and finally
02:02 - we have this door light which is just an
02:04 - emissive material also if I go ahead and
02:06 - hit play you will notice that the
02:09 - camera what the also if you go ahead and
02:11 - hit play you will notice that the camera
02:13 - rotates around our scene that's because
02:15 - I've gone ahead and created a turntable
02:17 - object here that has a script on it that
02:19 - will simply rotate the camera over time
02:21 - but of course currently our scene is
02:23 - looking really Bland so let's go ahead
02:26 - and modify it to make it look better the
02:28 - first thing we want to do is make sure
02:29 - that we have the hdrp package installed
02:32 - so we'll go to window and open up the
02:35 - package manager and as you can see I
02:37 - already have the high definition render
02:39 - pipeline here if you don't see it on the
02:40 - list make sure to go under Advanced and
02:42 - check Show preview packages simply find
02:45 - the package and install and updated I'm
02:48 - using version 4.9 and with that we're
02:51 - ready to start setting up hdrp and the
02:54 - first thing that we need to do is
02:55 - creating a render pipeline asset so
02:58 - we'll go to the project and right click
03:00 - we'll go create let's go under rendering
03:03 - and select high definition render
03:05 - pipeline asset let's just call this hdrp
03:08 - and with this asset selected we will get
03:10 - a bunch of rendering settings more
03:13 - specifically we get to choose what
03:14 - features we want to include in our
03:16 - render pipeline in here we have options
03:19 - for screen space ambient occlusion
03:21 - subsurface scattering volumetrics and so
03:24 - on for now we'll just leave these as is
03:26 - we then need to assign or render
03:28 - pipeline asset to our project to do that
03:30 - we'll go edit project settings and go
03:33 - under graphics and here you can see we
03:35 - have an empty slot for a render pipeline
03:37 - asset so let's go ahead and drag in our
03:40 - new asset and voila our project is now
03:43 - using hdrp however if we look in the
03:45 - game view we can see that we still have
03:47 - a few steps to go the first thing that
03:49 - we need to do is go to player go under
03:52 - other settings and rendering and here
03:55 - will change the color space from gamma
03:57 - to linear the color space determines the
04:00 - math used by unity when mixing colors in
04:02 - lighting calculations or reading values
04:05 - from textures changing the color space
04:07 - can have a drastic effect on the realism
04:09 - of your game a big advantage of using a
04:11 - linear color space is that the color
04:13 - supplied to shaders will brighten
04:15 - linearly as light intensity increases
04:17 - with the alternative gamma color space
04:19 - brightness will quickly begin to turn to
04:21 - wide as values go up which often leads
04:23 - to a very washed out looks so in other
04:25 - words for more lighting Fidelity we
04:26 - choose linear color space of course we
04:29 - can't really see has changed yet because
04:30 - all of our materials are currently
04:32 - appearing in this weird purple color the
04:35 - reason for this is that we need to
04:36 - update our materials to use an hdrp
04:38 - Shader so let's close down our project
04:41 - settings and let's find one of the
04:42 - materials in our scene I have a folder
04:45 - with mine here and I'm just going to
04:46 - select one of them and as you can see
04:48 - it's currently set to use the standard
04:50 - Shader so let's click on this let's go
04:52 - under hdrp and let's choose the lit
04:55 - Shader and right away we can see that
04:57 - all objects with this material assigned
04:59 - appear in our scene you could of course
05:01 - go through all materials in your project
05:03 - and update them one by one but if you
05:06 - have hundreds of materials that might
05:07 - take quite a bit of time luckily Unity
05:10 - has put in an option for exactly this if
05:13 - we go to edit render pipeline there's an
05:16 - option here to upgrade project materials
05:18 - to high definition materials let's
05:20 - simply click that let's hit proceed and
05:22 - voila it's gone ahead and change the
05:24 - Shader for each one of our materials
05:26 - awesome so the next step is to update
05:28 - all live to look good with hdrp so I'll
05:32 - go ahead and navigate to my lights here
05:34 - and let's go ahead and first disable all
05:36 - lights except our main light if we
05:39 - select this light we get a bunch of
05:40 - settings that allows us to configure it
05:42 - I'm going to go ahead and set the
05:43 - intensity of the light to three locks
05:45 - and I'll leave all the other settings as
05:47 - is now we can reenable all of our other
05:50 - lights and you'll see that we get this
05:52 - error in the console it says that
05:54 - Cascade Shadow atlasing has failed only
05:57 - one directional light can cast Shadows
05:59 - added time and this is a rule for hdrp
06:02 - but currently I have two directional
06:04 - lights the main light and the rim light
06:07 - and the rim light is also set to cast
06:09 - Shadows so I'm going to select it and go
06:12 - to shadows and simply disable Shadow
06:15 - Maps if we then clear our console we can
06:17 - see that the aror disappears and we now
06:20 - also have nice looking shadows in our
06:22 - scene I'll set the intensity of this
06:23 - light to three locks as well I'm also
06:25 - going to select all of our Point lights
06:28 - and set their intensity to 2,000 Lumen
06:31 - that definitely helps and brightens up
06:32 - the scene a lot so once we're happy with
06:34 - our lights we are ready to start
06:36 - configuring scene settings and to do
06:38 - this with hdrp we basically create an
06:41 - object with a volume settings component
06:44 - so inside of our hierarchy let's go
06:45 - create let's go under rendering and
06:47 - let's select the scene settings as you
06:50 - can see this creates an object called
06:51 - scene settings with a volume component
06:54 - and this component has a bunch of
06:56 - different settings let's go through this
06:58 - one by one so the first one is our HD
07:01 - Shadow settings this is of course
07:03 - responsible for showing high quality
07:05 - Shadows the main thing that we can
07:06 - modify here is the max distance which
07:09 - defines how far away we want to draw
07:11 - Shadows you can see if I set this to
07:13 - something like 40 it's only going to
07:15 - draw Shadows up to 40 units and then
07:18 - stop I'm just going to leave mine at 500
07:21 - next up we have the visual environment
07:23 - and this is where we choose two key
07:25 - Parts about our scene we choose what
07:28 - kind of Sky we want to use and what kind
07:30 - of fog we want to use as you can see if
07:33 - I disable this we just get a completely
07:35 - black environment with no fog or sky so
07:38 - for the Skype we have three different
07:40 - types we have a procedural sky this is
07:43 - generated to fit the scene and reacts to
07:46 - lighting changes in our scene this is
07:48 - the one that we're going to be using we
07:50 - also have an hdri sky this allows us to
07:53 - specify an hdri map which is basically
07:56 - just a very large texture for your sky
07:59 - finally we have gradient Sky which
08:01 - allows us to create a sky based on three
08:03 - colors so for now we'll leave this at
08:05 - procedural sky and you'll notice that we
08:07 - also have this procedur Sky module here
08:10 - where if we open this we can configure
08:12 - settings for our Sky I'm going to go
08:14 - ahead and disable the sun disc since I
08:16 - don't want any sun appearing in my
08:18 - environment we can also adjust the sky
08:20 - tint we could for example tinted red or
08:23 - any other color that you'd like I'd
08:25 - actually like to tint mine a tiny bit
08:27 - red we can adjust the ground color here
08:30 - let's for example make that blue we also
08:32 - have an option for exposure and so on so
08:35 - once you're happy with your Sky we can
08:36 - collapse this and next up is the fog
08:39 - type here we can choose between the
08:41 - default exponential fog we also have a
08:44 - linear fog and something exclusive to
08:47 - hdrp which is the volumetric fog this
08:50 - one is super cool let's go ahead and
08:52 - choose this right away you can see that
08:54 - our scene becomes black that's because
08:57 - we need to go ahead and remove our
08:59 - exponential fog here and instead we want
09:01 - to add another component override and
09:04 - here we choose the volumetric fog and
09:07 - for this we'll go ahead and change the
09:09 - base fog distance so I'm going to select
09:11 - that here and let's go ahead and update
09:13 - it to something like 80 we can also go
09:15 - in here and change the base height let's
09:18 - set that to one and the mean height
09:20 - let's set that to
09:22 - 4.5 and as you can see we are now seeing
09:25 - volumetric Lighting in our scene each
09:28 - one of our Point lights are now visible
09:31 - from within our scene you can see their
09:33 - Origins and if we go into the scene view
09:35 - we can see that really clearly around
09:37 - each point light we are seeing the light
09:39 - react to the fog in our scene and we can
09:42 - even start to see God Ray like shadows
09:45 - in our environment really really cool
09:48 - and just like with anything else we can
09:50 - of course change the color of this so if
09:52 - we go to the single scattering albo here
09:55 - we can even adjust the color of our fog
09:59 - so I'm going to set mine to this bluish
10:01 - color here I just think that looks
10:03 - really cool so the next thing that we
10:05 - can configure is our quality settings to
10:08 - do this we'll go to edit we'll open up
10:10 - our project settings once again we'll go
10:12 - under quality and here we have some
10:14 - different quality levels let's go ahead
10:16 - and bump this one up to ultra and you
10:18 - can see the most important thing that
10:20 - changed here was that our textures
10:22 - started to look much better that's
10:24 - because our texture quality is now set
10:26 - to full resolution and isotropic
10:28 - textures is now set to forced on which
10:30 - compared to per texture will avoid read
10:33 - stretching and blurring for your
10:35 - textures so that already looks much
10:37 - better the final big thing that we can
10:39 - add to our scene to really help tie
10:41 - everything together is of course post
10:43 - processing to add post processing to our
10:45 - scene we'll go to the hierarchy let's
10:47 - right click and create an empty object
10:49 - let's just reset the Transformer on this
10:51 - and let's call it post processing and
10:55 - here we want to add a post process
10:58 - volume
10:59 - let's set this to Global to make it
11:01 - affect our entire scene and we'll also
11:03 - go ahead and add a new profile where we
11:06 - can add effects to our volume in order
11:08 - to enable postprocessing we also need to
11:10 - find our camera and on here we need to
11:12 - add a postprocess layer component and on
11:15 - this component we need to choose what
11:17 - layers to search for postprocessing in
11:20 - so by default this is set to default
11:22 - let's go ahead and add a new layer
11:24 - called post processing let's select our
11:28 - post processing object and assign it
11:30 - this layer and let's go to our main
11:31 - camera and choose this layer also when
11:34 - we already have the main camera selected
11:37 - we can go ahead and add some
11:38 - anti-aliasing so anti-aliasing is the
11:41 - process of reducing Jagged edges it adds
11:44 - interpolation to try and smooth out
11:46 - stair step like lines and we have
11:49 - multiple modes to choose for this which
11:51 - one to choose depends on the result
11:53 - you're after I really recommend you
11:55 - experiment with these for your game in
11:57 - my case here I'm going to go ahead and
11:58 - select smaa and now if we go to our
12:01 - postprocessing object we can start
12:03 - adding effects so on this volume we can
12:06 - add all kinds of postprocessing effects
12:08 - to change the appearance of our game I'm
12:10 - not going to go in depth with each of
12:11 - these effects in this video but I'd love
12:13 - to do a dedicated video on it in the
12:15 - future but there's definitely one effect
12:17 - that I'd like to add here and that is
12:19 - color grading because one thing that is
12:21 - important to understand is the tone
12:24 - mapper so when using hdrp our cameras
12:27 - are automatically rendering in HD r or
12:29 - high dynamic range HDR allows us to
12:32 - store color data with much greater
12:33 - Precision which means that we won't lose
12:36 - detail in very bright or dark areas in
12:38 - other words bright things can be really
12:40 - bright dark things can be really dark
12:43 - and the details can be seen in both
12:45 - however we still have to Define how all
12:47 - this extra color data should be
12:48 - displayed on screen this is where tone
12:51 - mapping comes in we can either choose to
12:53 - configure the tone MPP ourselves or
12:55 - choose from a preset to do that we go
12:58 - under tone m mapping here enable that
13:00 - and as you can see there are two presets
13:02 - here and custom the neutral tone mapper
13:05 - as the name suggests gives a very
13:07 - neutral look with minimal impact on
13:09 - color Hue and saturation the aces tone
13:12 - mapper is more filmic and will produce a
13:15 - much more contrasted look as you can see
13:17 - here in my case here I'm going to go
13:19 - ahead and set it to Asus since I really
13:21 - like the look that this gives are seen
13:23 - I'm also going to go under tone and set
13:26 - the post exposure to one just to
13:29 - brighten the scene up a bit the next
13:30 - effect that I'd like to add is a bloom
13:33 - so I'm going to go under here and add a
13:35 - bloom postprocessing effect I'm also
13:37 - going to go in here and increase the
13:39 - intensity and as you can see this is
13:40 - going to add glow to Bright areas this
13:43 - is especially important for our emissive
13:46 - material if we go under the lights here
13:48 - and select the door light as you can see
13:50 - I have this glow material applied and
13:53 - under emission here we can configure the
13:55 - intensity of this emission so I'm going
13:57 - to go ahead and increase this and I'm
13:59 - also going to Tin it in a cool color
14:02 - like blue of course this is currently
14:04 - way too strong so let's go to our
14:06 - postprocessing and decrease the
14:07 - intensity there we go I think that looks
14:10 - really cool also think this thing could
14:12 - use a Viet so I'm going to go and add
14:15 - that as well again I'm going to override
14:17 - the intensity here and increase that a
14:19 - bit and finally because our scene is
14:22 - moving let's go in and add some motion
14:24 - blur and I think the default settings
14:26 - will work fine for this so if we now hit
14:29 - play we can see that we have a much much
14:31 - nicer looking scene and it's just by
14:34 - changing a few settings in unity awesome
14:37 - finally a really cool thing that I want
14:38 - to show you is the render pipeline debug
14:40 - window so if you go to window analysis
14:44 - and choose render pipeline debug we get
14:46 - this new separate window and we can use
14:49 - this to display all kinds of really cool
14:50 - information about lighting materials and
14:52 - rendering if for example we go under
14:54 - lighting here you can see that we have
14:56 - an option called lighting debug mode if
14:58 - if I go in here and change this to
15:00 - diffused lighting it's only going to
15:02 - show the diffused lighting happening in
15:04 - our scene we can do the same thing for
15:07 - specular lighting and many more if we
15:09 - set this To None we can also go in and
15:12 - override properties for our materials we
15:15 - could for example override the albo for
15:17 - all of our materials which means that we
15:19 - can just give all our materials a single
15:21 - color this is really cool because if we
15:22 - choose a neutral color like gray here we
15:24 - can see how lighting is affecting our
15:27 - scene without having to look at all the
15:29 - textures in fact we can also override
15:31 - other properties like smoothness if we
15:34 - want to see how our scene looks when
15:36 - it's really shiny I don't know when you
15:38 - would use this one but it's really cool
15:40 - so I definitely recommend that you check
15:41 - in with this debug window while you're
15:43 - building your scene to make sure that
15:45 - everything is looking good that's pretty
15:46 - much it for this video of course there
15:48 - is so much more to hdrp than what can be
15:51 - crammed into a single video from
15:53 - subsurface scattering to Reflections but
15:55 - hopefully you should now have a place to
15:57 - start exploring and and if you want to
15:59 - learn more about hdrp we'll of course
16:00 - have a link for that in the description
16:02 - also make sure to check out line of code
16:04 - and all the new cool designs simply

Cleaned transcript:

so a while back we did a video on how to get goodlooking Graphics in unity but since then there's been some major changes to how we work with Graphics in unity and at the center of these changes is a brand new rendering engine it's called the scriptable render pipeline or SRP for short SRP allows us to either choose a premade rendering pipeline provided by unity or to write our own C code to customize how things are rendered because SRP is so modular it can both be used for games that should run on lowerend devices and for games that Target AAA Hardware in this video we'll be working with hdrp or the highdefinition render pipeline we use hdrp whenever we want to achieve optimal rendering quality so in this video we'll turn this horrible looking scene into this just using hdrp also this video is sponsored by unity now before we get into it we've been working on some new designs for line of code and they are finally here woohoo wooho we work together with Blackthorn prod who is just an amazing art artist and game developer to create these four cool looking shirts I think my personal favorite is the hard one it's just so cute but that is not all we also have this really cool new design by Thea and a new game Jam one in collaboration with mm and on top of that we've gotten a lot of requests to bring these designs onto female fitted shirts so we've of course gone ahead and done that as well so simply visit lineof code. and use the coupon code shirt me up to get 10% off for the first week also if you're like me and absolutely love everything that black thornn Pro does he does have his own YouTube channel and it's even on em me with some beginner courses also before we get started special thanks to Jack jubert Andrew Keno John Shannon and infinity PPR for their support on Patron all right let's jump into the video so as you can see I've gone ahead and set up this simple example scene in here we have some models from the Mayan timble pack I'll of course have a link to where you can download these in the description I've also gone ahead and set up a few lights we have two directional lights as well as a few Point lights scattered around the scene and finally we have this door light which is just an emissive material also if I go ahead and hit play you will notice that the camera what the also if you go ahead and hit play you will notice that the camera rotates around our scene that's because I've gone ahead and created a turntable object here that has a script on it that will simply rotate the camera over time but of course currently our scene is looking really Bland so let's go ahead and modify it to make it look better the first thing we want to do is make sure that we have the hdrp package installed so we'll go to window and open up the package manager and as you can see I already have the high definition render pipeline here if you don't see it on the list make sure to go under Advanced and check Show preview packages simply find the package and install and updated I'm using version 4.9 and with that we're ready to start setting up hdrp and the first thing that we need to do is creating a render pipeline asset so we'll go to the project and right click we'll go create let's go under rendering and select high definition render pipeline asset let's just call this hdrp and with this asset selected we will get a bunch of rendering settings more specifically we get to choose what features we want to include in our render pipeline in here we have options for screen space ambient occlusion subsurface scattering volumetrics and so on for now we'll just leave these as is we then need to assign or render pipeline asset to our project to do that we'll go edit project settings and go under graphics and here you can see we have an empty slot for a render pipeline asset so let's go ahead and drag in our new asset and voila our project is now using hdrp however if we look in the game view we can see that we still have a few steps to go the first thing that we need to do is go to player go under other settings and rendering and here will change the color space from gamma to linear the color space determines the math used by unity when mixing colors in lighting calculations or reading values from textures changing the color space can have a drastic effect on the realism of your game a big advantage of using a linear color space is that the color supplied to shaders will brighten linearly as light intensity increases with the alternative gamma color space brightness will quickly begin to turn to wide as values go up which often leads to a very washed out looks so in other words for more lighting Fidelity we choose linear color space of course we can't really see has changed yet because all of our materials are currently appearing in this weird purple color the reason for this is that we need to update our materials to use an hdrp Shader so let's close down our project settings and let's find one of the materials in our scene I have a folder with mine here and I'm just going to select one of them and as you can see it's currently set to use the standard Shader so let's click on this let's go under hdrp and let's choose the lit Shader and right away we can see that all objects with this material assigned appear in our scene you could of course go through all materials in your project and update them one by one but if you have hundreds of materials that might take quite a bit of time luckily Unity has put in an option for exactly this if we go to edit render pipeline there's an option here to upgrade project materials to high definition materials let's simply click that let's hit proceed and voila it's gone ahead and change the Shader for each one of our materials awesome so the next step is to update all live to look good with hdrp so I'll go ahead and navigate to my lights here and let's go ahead and first disable all lights except our main light if we select this light we get a bunch of settings that allows us to configure it I'm going to go ahead and set the intensity of the light to three locks and I'll leave all the other settings as is now we can reenable all of our other lights and you'll see that we get this error in the console it says that Cascade Shadow atlasing has failed only one directional light can cast Shadows added time and this is a rule for hdrp but currently I have two directional lights the main light and the rim light and the rim light is also set to cast Shadows so I'm going to select it and go to shadows and simply disable Shadow Maps if we then clear our console we can see that the aror disappears and we now also have nice looking shadows in our scene I'll set the intensity of this light to three locks as well I'm also going to select all of our Point lights and set their intensity to 2,000 Lumen that definitely helps and brightens up the scene a lot so once we're happy with our lights we are ready to start configuring scene settings and to do this with hdrp we basically create an object with a volume settings component so inside of our hierarchy let's go create let's go under rendering and let's select the scene settings as you can see this creates an object called scene settings with a volume component and this component has a bunch of different settings let's go through this one by one so the first one is our HD Shadow settings this is of course responsible for showing high quality Shadows the main thing that we can modify here is the max distance which defines how far away we want to draw Shadows you can see if I set this to something like 40 it's only going to draw Shadows up to 40 units and then stop I'm just going to leave mine at 500 next up we have the visual environment and this is where we choose two key Parts about our scene we choose what kind of Sky we want to use and what kind of fog we want to use as you can see if I disable this we just get a completely black environment with no fog or sky so for the Skype we have three different types we have a procedural sky this is generated to fit the scene and reacts to lighting changes in our scene this is the one that we're going to be using we also have an hdri sky this allows us to specify an hdri map which is basically just a very large texture for your sky finally we have gradient Sky which allows us to create a sky based on three colors so for now we'll leave this at procedural sky and you'll notice that we also have this procedur Sky module here where if we open this we can configure settings for our Sky I'm going to go ahead and disable the sun disc since I don't want any sun appearing in my environment we can also adjust the sky tint we could for example tinted red or any other color that you'd like I'd actually like to tint mine a tiny bit red we can adjust the ground color here let's for example make that blue we also have an option for exposure and so on so once you're happy with your Sky we can collapse this and next up is the fog type here we can choose between the default exponential fog we also have a linear fog and something exclusive to hdrp which is the volumetric fog this one is super cool let's go ahead and choose this right away you can see that our scene becomes black that's because we need to go ahead and remove our exponential fog here and instead we want to add another component override and here we choose the volumetric fog and for this we'll go ahead and change the base fog distance so I'm going to select that here and let's go ahead and update it to something like 80 we can also go in here and change the base height let's set that to one and the mean height let's set that to 4.5 and as you can see we are now seeing volumetric Lighting in our scene each one of our Point lights are now visible from within our scene you can see their Origins and if we go into the scene view we can see that really clearly around each point light we are seeing the light react to the fog in our scene and we can even start to see God Ray like shadows in our environment really really cool and just like with anything else we can of course change the color of this so if we go to the single scattering albo here we can even adjust the color of our fog so I'm going to set mine to this bluish color here I just think that looks really cool so the next thing that we can configure is our quality settings to do this we'll go to edit we'll open up our project settings once again we'll go under quality and here we have some different quality levels let's go ahead and bump this one up to ultra and you can see the most important thing that changed here was that our textures started to look much better that's because our texture quality is now set to full resolution and isotropic textures is now set to forced on which compared to per texture will avoid read stretching and blurring for your textures so that already looks much better the final big thing that we can add to our scene to really help tie everything together is of course post processing to add post processing to our scene we'll go to the hierarchy let's right click and create an empty object let's just reset the Transformer on this and let's call it post processing and here we want to add a post process volume let's set this to Global to make it affect our entire scene and we'll also go ahead and add a new profile where we can add effects to our volume in order to enable postprocessing we also need to find our camera and on here we need to add a postprocess layer component and on this component we need to choose what layers to search for postprocessing in so by default this is set to default let's go ahead and add a new layer called post processing let's select our post processing object and assign it this layer and let's go to our main camera and choose this layer also when we already have the main camera selected we can go ahead and add some antialiasing so antialiasing is the process of reducing Jagged edges it adds interpolation to try and smooth out stair step like lines and we have multiple modes to choose for this which one to choose depends on the result you're after I really recommend you experiment with these for your game in my case here I'm going to go ahead and select smaa and now if we go to our postprocessing object we can start adding effects so on this volume we can add all kinds of postprocessing effects to change the appearance of our game I'm not going to go in depth with each of these effects in this video but I'd love to do a dedicated video on it in the future but there's definitely one effect that I'd like to add here and that is color grading because one thing that is important to understand is the tone mapper so when using hdrp our cameras are automatically rendering in HD r or high dynamic range HDR allows us to store color data with much greater Precision which means that we won't lose detail in very bright or dark areas in other words bright things can be really bright dark things can be really dark and the details can be seen in both however we still have to Define how all this extra color data should be displayed on screen this is where tone mapping comes in we can either choose to configure the tone MPP ourselves or choose from a preset to do that we go under tone m mapping here enable that and as you can see there are two presets here and custom the neutral tone mapper as the name suggests gives a very neutral look with minimal impact on color Hue and saturation the aces tone mapper is more filmic and will produce a much more contrasted look as you can see here in my case here I'm going to go ahead and set it to Asus since I really like the look that this gives are seen I'm also going to go under tone and set the post exposure to one just to brighten the scene up a bit the next effect that I'd like to add is a bloom so I'm going to go under here and add a bloom postprocessing effect I'm also going to go in here and increase the intensity and as you can see this is going to add glow to Bright areas this is especially important for our emissive material if we go under the lights here and select the door light as you can see I have this glow material applied and under emission here we can configure the intensity of this emission so I'm going to go ahead and increase this and I'm also going to Tin it in a cool color like blue of course this is currently way too strong so let's go to our postprocessing and decrease the intensity there we go I think that looks really cool also think this thing could use a Viet so I'm going to go and add that as well again I'm going to override the intensity here and increase that a bit and finally because our scene is moving let's go in and add some motion blur and I think the default settings will work fine for this so if we now hit play we can see that we have a much much nicer looking scene and it's just by changing a few settings in unity awesome finally a really cool thing that I want to show you is the render pipeline debug window so if you go to window analysis and choose render pipeline debug we get this new separate window and we can use this to display all kinds of really cool information about lighting materials and rendering if for example we go under lighting here you can see that we have an option called lighting debug mode if if I go in here and change this to diffused lighting it's only going to show the diffused lighting happening in our scene we can do the same thing for specular lighting and many more if we set this To None we can also go in and override properties for our materials we could for example override the albo for all of our materials which means that we can just give all our materials a single color this is really cool because if we choose a neutral color like gray here we can see how lighting is affecting our scene without having to look at all the textures in fact we can also override other properties like smoothness if we want to see how our scene looks when it's really shiny I don't know when you would use this one but it's really cool so I definitely recommend that you check in with this debug window while you're building your scene to make sure that everything is looking good that's pretty much it for this video of course there is so much more to hdrp than what can be crammed into a single video from subsurface scattering to Reflections but hopefully you should now have a place to start exploring and and if you want to learn more about hdrp
