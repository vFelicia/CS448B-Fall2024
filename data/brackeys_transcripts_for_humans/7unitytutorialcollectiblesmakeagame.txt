00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - part seven in make a game a cool series
00:09 - on making a video game in unity so
00:12 - basically you should be seeing two
00:14 - things on your screen right now first of
00:16 - which is my Twitter username that's
00:19 - brey's tweet please go ahead and tweet
00:21 - to me if you make something cool using
00:24 - these tutorials so if you've used them
00:26 - in any way please tweet pictures or a
00:30 - download link and there's a chance you
00:32 - might be featured in the next video so
00:34 - I'll start featuring projects and you'll
00:37 - also you're also seeing a preview of
00:40 - what we're going to be making which is
00:41 - pickups or collectible items in this
00:44 - case we're going to be making a coin so
00:47 - we're going to do a little bit of
00:48 - scripting and a bit of visual stuff also
00:51 - so it's half half cool so let's just get
00:54 - started as always I've opened up unity
00:57 - and uh first off let's create the
01:00 - pickups and the visual side of it so
01:02 - let's go to game object create other and
01:07 - select
01:08 - sphere and we should see it appearing
01:11 - here but let's just Center it in our
01:12 - project so we know where it is so 0 0
01:16 - 0 in the transform then move it up here
01:21 - and move it to the side just so we have
01:22 - a good look of what's going on also if
01:26 - if you don't see any Shadows or lighting
01:28 - uh go up and click this sun here in the
01:31 - um top of the scene view uh to get the
01:34 - lighting turned on um because what we're
01:37 - going to be do doing is we're going to
01:39 - be making this look really shiny and
01:42 - that means it will not be affected uh
01:46 - that means that if our light is not that
01:48 - powerful it should still be shining
01:50 - somewhat so we are going to be using
01:53 - lights let's rename this bowl to
01:57 - coin and uh let's first off changed the
02:00 - shape of it just a bit so let's uh scale
02:04 - it
02:05 - down on the
02:08 - xais to something like 0.3 I'll just
02:13 - make it 0.3 exactly so you can follow
02:15 - along and we can all already start
02:18 - seeing it looking more like a coin and
02:21 - uh what we'll do now is we will delete
02:23 - the sphere collider so right click on
02:25 - this and hit remove component and
02:28 - basically what will happen now if we hit
02:30 - this is we go right through it uh and
02:33 - that's not really something we want we
02:35 - want it to disappear as soon as we hit
02:37 - it so we're going to add a new collider
02:40 - we're going to press add component
02:43 - physics and then box collider and you
02:46 - might be thinking well this is not a box
02:49 - but uh the type of collision we're going
02:51 - to be doing here is simply checking
02:53 - whether not our ball has collected the
02:55 - coin and that does not require any more
02:58 - complicated of a shape than the Box um
03:01 - simply because we can't roll in the Z
03:04 - Direction and well yeah there's not much
03:07 - of a difference between the shape of the
03:10 - coin and the shape of the
03:12 - Box uh but yeah it should have adjusted
03:15 - the box for us so it fits else you can
03:17 - go ahead and adjust the center and the
03:19 - size properties one thing we have to
03:21 - remember to do and this is a crucial
03:23 - step is to check the is trigger because
03:26 - if we just go ahead and play now we will
03:29 - collide with with it and that's not
03:31 - something we want we just want to be
03:32 - able to check whether or not our ball
03:35 - has entered the coin and that is done by
03:38 - checking the is trigger so now that we
03:41 - have the is trigger enabled um we can
03:44 - start creating a script but before we do
03:46 - so let's just make this look a little
03:49 - more awesome so go down to the project
03:52 - pane right click hit create and then
03:56 - material so we're going to be making a
03:57 - new material and remember in one of the
03:59 - the last videos I explained what a
04:01 - material are what a texture are and a
04:03 - material is what contains stuff like
04:06 - textures and shaders so it's
04:08 - um you normally have just one material
04:11 - for each object but you can have more uh
04:14 - this one is just going to have a single
04:16 - one and we're going to call this let's
04:18 - say
04:19 - glow
04:21 - glowing and it won't actually be glowing
04:23 - but we'll make it look like it we're
04:25 - going to fake the effect a little bit um
04:28 - and uh what we're going to do is simply
04:30 - just change the melon color to something
04:32 - a little more dark I always do this
04:34 - because when I then drag it onto the
04:36 - coin we can see it changing like this
04:40 - okay but this is not what we want so B
04:42 - basically select the material in the
04:45 - project pane you can also select it
04:47 - under the coin but then you're going to
04:49 - have all the stuff in the way so I don't
04:52 - recommend that just select it in the
04:53 - project Pane and what we're going to be
04:56 - doing first is changing the Shader
04:58 - because no matter how bright we we make
05:00 - this or red or yellow or whatever it
05:02 - doesn't really look that glowing and
05:06 - interesting because this side is really
05:08 - dark and uh what we're going to do to
05:10 - change this is we're going to change the
05:12 - Shader we could change it to something
05:14 - like a specula so we can add a little
05:16 - bit of glow on this side here um and
05:19 - that helps definitely but this side is
05:21 - still way too dark in my opinion so what
05:24 - we're going to do is we're instead going
05:26 - to go down to
05:28 - self-illuminated and then select diffuse
05:31 - self-illuminated means that this um
05:34 - object even though it's in the shade
05:36 - will still have light because it's
05:37 - Illuminating itself and uh you can also
05:41 - have this uh emit light onto other
05:45 - objects but you will have to bake that
05:47 - meaning uh that we have to go through
05:50 - this whole process of making sure this
05:53 - object doesn't move and then making a
05:55 - texture out of it and oing with objects
05:58 - and such it's not something something we
05:59 - want to do for this game for sure
06:01 - because it's so simple so what we're
06:03 - going to do instead is we're going to
06:04 - add a light to it in a moment uh but
06:07 - basically that means that we can leave
06:09 - the illumination map off we can leave
06:12 - the emission uh light MPP as is and uh
06:16 - you can add a texture if you want some
06:18 - texture in there I don't think it's
06:19 - needed uh basically we can just adjust
06:22 - the uh color of this until we get a look
06:25 - just right I want it to be really yellow
06:28 - uh like this and maybe a little more
06:30 - orange like that so we get a little bit
06:33 - of a shaded effect so this side is
06:35 - darker but it's not much and now I think
06:38 - it actually looks pretty fine but as we
06:41 - can see it's not shining onto other the
06:43 - objects so to achieve that this let's
06:46 - add a light and Center it on the coin to
06:49 - do this go to game object create other
06:53 - and then point
06:54 - light let's rename this to coin light
07:00 - drag it onto the
07:02 - coin and then Center the position
07:06 - variables and now you might be thinking
07:09 - why does this Center on the coin and not
07:11 - the center of the scene when its
07:13 - transform is 0 0 0 and that's because
07:16 - whenever we drag an object onto another
07:19 - one we do what is called parenting it so
07:22 - if we take a closer look at what I did
07:25 - to parented up in the hierarchy I
07:27 - selected the coin light and I dragged it
07:30 - onto the coin see that right now the
07:33 - position variables are 2.6 *
07:37 - 1.2 this is because it's 2.6 in the X
07:42 - and 1.2 in the Y so if we go ahead and
07:44 - censer this now it will be in the center
07:46 - of the
07:47 - scene though if we go ahead and drag
07:50 - this on the coin it will be 0 Z and
07:54 - that's because it's now oriented through
07:56 - the coin so if it's 0 0 it will be in
07:59 - the center of the coin that's something
08:02 - uh that confuses a lot of people but
08:04 - it's worth uh
08:07 - noticing cool now that we have this in
08:09 - the center of the coin let's just play a
08:11 - little bit around with its light
08:13 - properties I think it's emitting a
08:16 - pretty beautiful amount of light uh it
08:18 - might be just a bit too much uh but
08:21 - we're definitely going to change the
08:22 - color just a bit and whenever you're
08:24 - changing the color of light watch out it
08:27 - doesn't get too much I think this is too
08:29 - much uh will make it a little more wiish
08:32 - so about half of half the way between
08:37 - wide and completely saturated and then
08:40 - yeah the orange
08:42 - color and we can just bump down the
08:45 - intensity just a bit to something like
08:48 - 0.7 let's try that
08:51 - 0.7 and I think this looks pretty
08:53 - awesome and now when we play the game we
08:56 - can see the light affecting our ball and
08:58 - it's
09:00 - surroundings cool uh what we can also do
09:03 - is add an animation to this coin but I
09:07 - think we're going to do that in a later
09:08 - video since I want to take good time
09:11 - explaining the animated
09:13 - window uh we also going to have a cool
09:16 - particle effect uh whenever the ball
09:19 - picks up the coin but in that is again
09:22 - for another video uh so in this one
09:24 - we're just going to make it
09:27 - disappear cool now let's finally create
09:30 - the script so select the coin not the
09:32 - coin light hit add component new script
09:36 - and let's call this
09:40 - coin actually let's do coin
09:43 - pickup there hit create an ad double
09:47 - click it to open it up in mono develop
09:50 - and we're just going to wait for it to
09:52 - open
09:57 - up there there we go well basically now
10:01 - we have to use a function that will
10:04 - trigger whenever our ball
10:06 - ENT uh our trigger collider so to do
10:10 - this Unity has made a function for us
10:13 - which functions perfectly we this is
10:16 - called ont trigger enter so instead of
10:19 - update we can just get rid of the
10:21 - function start instead of update we're
10:23 - going to type on
10:26 - trigger enter
10:29 - this will be called whenever something
10:32 - enters the trigger on our ball or our
10:35 - coin so basically what we want to do now
10:38 - is we want to check what has entered
10:41 - because if our coin is colliding with
10:44 - the ground this could just be called all
10:46 - the time so instead we want to check if
10:49 - it is actually our ball collecting the
10:51 - coin to do this we have to tell Unity
10:54 - that we want information out of this
10:56 - Collis and we do that by first off
10:59 - naming our information I'll just call it
11:02 - info this is done in the
11:05 - parenthesis uh then we want to specify a
11:08 - type of information and that's going to
11:10 - be of type
11:13 - collider this is just something you have
11:15 - to remember it's not something that I
11:18 - expect you to understand right away
11:20 - since it's a little weird this
11:22 - information gathering and
11:25 - such uh but basically what we're doing
11:27 - is we're saying if something ERS tell
11:30 - tell us more about what has entered and
11:33 - call this information info then we want
11:36 - to check if info. name is actually equal
11:40 - to our ball so if info. name is equal to
11:47 - and then what did we we just called it
11:49 - ball so if info. name is equal to
11:54 - ball and then we can go ahead and open
11:56 - up some bracket
11:57 - keys and let's just go ahead and check
12:00 - if this code works and we can do this by
12:03 - using a
12:04 - debug.log
12:06 - and then open up parenthesis and say uh
12:11 - coin picked
12:14 - up you can type whatever you want here
12:17 - but basically debug. logs are used to
12:20 - check if code is working so if we go
12:23 - under the console window down here and
12:26 - now play the game we should see coin
12:29 - picked up whenever we picked up pick up
12:32 - this coin so if we roll in here you can
12:35 - see it says coin picked up that's just
12:38 - what we want but right now we're
12:40 - checking for a name we could also be
12:43 - even more con convenient and check for a
12:45 - tag if our let's say our game has
12:48 - multiple players who should all be able
12:50 - to pick up this coin it's better to use
12:53 - tag so we'll use info. tag and then it
12:58 - needs to be able to uh check for player
13:02 - save this and hit into
13:05 - Unity this is not going to work right
13:07 - away we can just check this by clearing
13:10 - the error here or pressing clear and
13:12 - play and then
13:13 - playing so if we play once more
13:16 - here nothing happens when we enter the
13:20 - coin that's because we actually have to
13:22 - tag our ball you do this by selecting it
13:27 - and going to the inspector where says
13:29 - tag here we can just select the player
13:32 - if you want another tag hit add tag and
13:35 - add it to the list then go under the
13:38 - ball and assign it I'm just going to go
13:41 - with player since the ball is actually
13:43 - our player now we can see that this is
13:47 - all looking right and we have tagged our
13:50 - player so let's select the console
13:52 - window and have a go at it and see if it
13:55 - works it
13:57 - does great so so now we don't really
14:00 - just want the console to say coin picked
14:02 - up we want something to actually happen
14:05 - first off we want the game object uh to
14:08 - be destroyed so destroy and then in the
14:13 - parenthesis here type game
14:15 - object with a small
14:18 - G that's important so uh whenever we do
14:22 - this destroy the destroy function is
14:25 - obviously used to destroy things but
14:27 - game object when we just type it like
14:29 - this means that it's the uh object the
14:32 - script is sitting on that will be
14:34 - destroyed so that means our coin if we
14:37 - go ahead and test this oops try
14:40 - again hit
14:42 - play and uh roll into our
14:46 - coin H okay I'm back Unity was having
14:50 - some problems but uh it's gone now I
14:53 - restarted it so let's hit play and uh
14:56 - now we can simply roll into our coin and
14:59 - the coin disappears and also the coin
15:01 - lights because it's it's parented to the
15:04 - coin so that disappears with
15:07 - it great uh but uh that that's basically
15:10 - it for the simple part of the script we
15:13 - could also add a coun that gets bigger
15:16 - and bigger whenever we pick up a coin so
15:19 - we can keep track of how many coins we
15:22 - have picked up we'll go ahead and do
15:24 - this in a later video in a separate
15:26 - script uh but basically to remember um
15:30 - to make us remember that we need to do
15:32 - this right before we destroy the game
15:34 - object let's put in the debug.log
15:38 - saying that uh we should add some
15:41 - functionality here let's just say add
15:45 - coin
15:49 - counter
15:52 - here this is great if you multiple
15:55 - people working on a project or just for
15:57 - remembering things you need to add so
16:00 - now when we hit play the coin disappears
16:03 - and it says add coin counter here that's
16:06 - basically it for this video guys I hope
16:09 - you enjoyed it and I really look forward
16:11 - to seeing what you have made using the
16:13 - tutorials again the um if if you want to
16:16 - tweet to me do it at brais tweet again
16:20 - brais tweet thank you for watching the
16:23 - video and I'll see you in the next
16:26 - [Music]
16:27 - one
16:32 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to part seven in make a game a cool series on making a video game in unity so basically you should be seeing two things on your screen right now first of which is my Twitter username that's brey's tweet please go ahead and tweet to me if you make something cool using these tutorials so if you've used them in any way please tweet pictures or a download link and there's a chance you might be featured in the next video so I'll start featuring projects and you'll also you're also seeing a preview of what we're going to be making which is pickups or collectible items in this case we're going to be making a coin so we're going to do a little bit of scripting and a bit of visual stuff also so it's half half cool so let's just get started as always I've opened up unity and uh first off let's create the pickups and the visual side of it so let's go to game object create other and select sphere and we should see it appearing here but let's just Center it in our project so we know where it is so 0 0 0 in the transform then move it up here and move it to the side just so we have a good look of what's going on also if if you don't see any Shadows or lighting uh go up and click this sun here in the um top of the scene view uh to get the lighting turned on um because what we're going to be do doing is we're going to be making this look really shiny and that means it will not be affected uh that means that if our light is not that powerful it should still be shining somewhat so we are going to be using lights let's rename this bowl to coin and uh let's first off changed the shape of it just a bit so let's uh scale it down on the xais to something like 0.3 I'll just make it 0.3 exactly so you can follow along and we can all already start seeing it looking more like a coin and uh what we'll do now is we will delete the sphere collider so right click on this and hit remove component and basically what will happen now if we hit this is we go right through it uh and that's not really something we want we want it to disappear as soon as we hit it so we're going to add a new collider we're going to press add component physics and then box collider and you might be thinking well this is not a box but uh the type of collision we're going to be doing here is simply checking whether not our ball has collected the coin and that does not require any more complicated of a shape than the Box um simply because we can't roll in the Z Direction and well yeah there's not much of a difference between the shape of the coin and the shape of the Box uh but yeah it should have adjusted the box for us so it fits else you can go ahead and adjust the center and the size properties one thing we have to remember to do and this is a crucial step is to check the is trigger because if we just go ahead and play now we will collide with with it and that's not something we want we just want to be able to check whether or not our ball has entered the coin and that is done by checking the is trigger so now that we have the is trigger enabled um we can start creating a script but before we do so let's just make this look a little more awesome so go down to the project pane right click hit create and then material so we're going to be making a new material and remember in one of the the last videos I explained what a material are what a texture are and a material is what contains stuff like textures and shaders so it's um you normally have just one material for each object but you can have more uh this one is just going to have a single one and we're going to call this let's say glow glowing and it won't actually be glowing but we'll make it look like it we're going to fake the effect a little bit um and uh what we're going to do is simply just change the melon color to something a little more dark I always do this because when I then drag it onto the coin we can see it changing like this okay but this is not what we want so B basically select the material in the project pane you can also select it under the coin but then you're going to have all the stuff in the way so I don't recommend that just select it in the project Pane and what we're going to be doing first is changing the Shader because no matter how bright we we make this or red or yellow or whatever it doesn't really look that glowing and interesting because this side is really dark and uh what we're going to do to change this is we're going to change the Shader we could change it to something like a specula so we can add a little bit of glow on this side here um and that helps definitely but this side is still way too dark in my opinion so what we're going to do is we're instead going to go down to selfilluminated and then select diffuse selfilluminated means that this um object even though it's in the shade will still have light because it's Illuminating itself and uh you can also have this uh emit light onto other objects but you will have to bake that meaning uh that we have to go through this whole process of making sure this object doesn't move and then making a texture out of it and oing with objects and such it's not something something we want to do for this game for sure because it's so simple so what we're going to do instead is we're going to add a light to it in a moment uh but basically that means that we can leave the illumination map off we can leave the emission uh light MPP as is and uh you can add a texture if you want some texture in there I don't think it's needed uh basically we can just adjust the uh color of this until we get a look just right I want it to be really yellow uh like this and maybe a little more orange like that so we get a little bit of a shaded effect so this side is darker but it's not much and now I think it actually looks pretty fine but as we can see it's not shining onto other the objects so to achieve that this let's add a light and Center it on the coin to do this go to game object create other and then point light let's rename this to coin light drag it onto the coin and then Center the position variables and now you might be thinking why does this Center on the coin and not the center of the scene when its transform is 0 0 0 and that's because whenever we drag an object onto another one we do what is called parenting it so if we take a closer look at what I did to parented up in the hierarchy I selected the coin light and I dragged it onto the coin see that right now the position variables are 2.6 * 1.2 this is because it's 2.6 in the X and 1.2 in the Y so if we go ahead and censer this now it will be in the center of the scene though if we go ahead and drag this on the coin it will be 0 Z and that's because it's now oriented through the coin so if it's 0 0 it will be in the center of the coin that's something uh that confuses a lot of people but it's worth uh noticing cool now that we have this in the center of the coin let's just play a little bit around with its light properties I think it's emitting a pretty beautiful amount of light uh it might be just a bit too much uh but we're definitely going to change the color just a bit and whenever you're changing the color of light watch out it doesn't get too much I think this is too much uh will make it a little more wiish so about half of half the way between wide and completely saturated and then yeah the orange color and we can just bump down the intensity just a bit to something like 0.7 let's try that 0.7 and I think this looks pretty awesome and now when we play the game we can see the light affecting our ball and it's surroundings cool uh what we can also do is add an animation to this coin but I think we're going to do that in a later video since I want to take good time explaining the animated window uh we also going to have a cool particle effect uh whenever the ball picks up the coin but in that is again for another video uh so in this one we're just going to make it disappear cool now let's finally create the script so select the coin not the coin light hit add component new script and let's call this coin actually let's do coin pickup there hit create an ad double click it to open it up in mono develop and we're just going to wait for it to open up there there we go well basically now we have to use a function that will trigger whenever our ball ENT uh our trigger collider so to do this Unity has made a function for us which functions perfectly we this is called ont trigger enter so instead of update we can just get rid of the function start instead of update we're going to type on trigger enter this will be called whenever something enters the trigger on our ball or our coin so basically what we want to do now is we want to check what has entered because if our coin is colliding with the ground this could just be called all the time so instead we want to check if it is actually our ball collecting the coin to do this we have to tell Unity that we want information out of this Collis and we do that by first off naming our information I'll just call it info this is done in the parenthesis uh then we want to specify a type of information and that's going to be of type collider this is just something you have to remember it's not something that I expect you to understand right away since it's a little weird this information gathering and such uh but basically what we're doing is we're saying if something ERS tell tell us more about what has entered and call this information info then we want to check if info. name is actually equal to our ball so if info. name is equal to and then what did we we just called it ball so if info. name is equal to ball and then we can go ahead and open up some bracket keys and let's just go ahead and check if this code works and we can do this by using a debug.log and then open up parenthesis and say uh coin picked up you can type whatever you want here but basically debug. logs are used to check if code is working so if we go under the console window down here and now play the game we should see coin picked up whenever we picked up pick up this coin so if we roll in here you can see it says coin picked up that's just what we want but right now we're checking for a name we could also be even more con convenient and check for a tag if our let's say our game has multiple players who should all be able to pick up this coin it's better to use tag so we'll use info. tag and then it needs to be able to uh check for player save this and hit into Unity this is not going to work right away we can just check this by clearing the error here or pressing clear and play and then playing so if we play once more here nothing happens when we enter the coin that's because we actually have to tag our ball you do this by selecting it and going to the inspector where says tag here we can just select the player if you want another tag hit add tag and add it to the list then go under the ball and assign it I'm just going to go with player since the ball is actually our player now we can see that this is all looking right and we have tagged our player so let's select the console window and have a go at it and see if it works it does great so so now we don't really just want the console to say coin picked up we want something to actually happen first off we want the game object uh to be destroyed so destroy and then in the parenthesis here type game object with a small G that's important so uh whenever we do this destroy the destroy function is obviously used to destroy things but game object when we just type it like this means that it's the uh object the script is sitting on that will be destroyed so that means our coin if we go ahead and test this oops try again hit play and uh roll into our coin H okay I'm back Unity was having some problems but uh it's gone now I restarted it so let's hit play and uh now we can simply roll into our coin and the coin disappears and also the coin lights because it's it's parented to the coin so that disappears with it great uh but uh that that's basically it for the simple part of the script we could also add a coun that gets bigger and bigger whenever we pick up a coin so we can keep track of how many coins we have picked up we'll go ahead and do this in a later video in a separate script uh but basically to remember um to make us remember that we need to do this right before we destroy the game object let's put in the debug.log saying that uh we should add some functionality here let's just say add coin counter here this is great if you multiple people working on a project or just for remembering things you need to add so now when we hit play the coin disappears and it says add coin counter here that's basically it for this video guys I hope you enjoyed it and I really look forward to seeing what you have made using the tutorials again the um if if you want to tweet to me do it at brais tweet again brais tweet thank you for watching the video and I'll see you in the next one
