With timestamps:

00:00 - in this video we'll learn how to create
00:01 - pixel art in Photoshop we'll have a look
00:03 - at what tools to use and how to best
00:04 - configure Photoshop to suit your pixel
00:06 - needs special thanks to Han soft tune
00:07 - Zhu diamond and our Minoru C for their
00:09 - support on patreon and with that let's
00:12 - get painting so first we want to set up
00:13 - a canvas and configure it for pixel art
00:15 - to create a new canvas we'll go file new
00:17 - we'll give it a name say pixel art we'll
00:20 - change the unit to pixels and of course
00:23 - this is going to depend on the
00:24 - dimensions of what you want to make but
00:26 - remember we can always change this later
00:27 - I'm just gonna set mine to 45 40 let's
00:30 - set the resolution to 72 and we can
00:33 - leave all the other settings as is
00:35 - let's hit create and we now have a new
00:37 - although fairly tiny canvas to zoom in
00:39 - on it let's hold down alt and scroll
00:41 - there we go our canvas is of course
00:43 - completely empty that's fine
00:45 - but we don't have any indication of
00:47 - where we can paint pixels that's why we
00:49 - want to set up a grid first we want to
00:51 - go to view show then select grid and you
00:54 - might see some grid lines here but
00:55 - chances that they are way too big so
00:57 - change this will go edit preferences I
01:00 - will select guides grid and slices here
01:02 - under the grid section we can configure
01:04 - the lines first you want a grid line
01:06 - every one and then instead of inches
01:08 - that select pixels and you can see it
01:10 - already updating in the background you
01:12 - also see that each pixel is currently
01:14 - subdivided by 4 we really don't need
01:16 - that information so let's go to
01:17 - subdivisions and change that to 1 then
01:20 - you can set any color that you'd like
01:21 - here I like the light gray you can even
01:24 - go in and change the line type when
01:26 - we're happy with this we want to go
01:27 - under general and here we see a setting
01:29 - called image interpolation by default
01:32 - this is set to bicubic automatic this
01:34 - might sound pretty scary but really all
01:36 - this does is choose the technique that
01:37 - we want to use when scaling an image and
01:40 - by default this is set to try and smooth
01:42 - out lines but when working with pixel
01:44 - art we always want hard edges so let's
01:46 - go and change this technique to nearest
01:48 - neighbor and weensy it also says
01:50 - preserve hard edges so now when we scale
01:52 - up our pixel art it won't become weird
01:54 - and blurred let's select ok and that's
01:57 - pretty much all of the settings that we
01:58 - need to configure for our canvas now we
02:00 - can go to the bottom right and create a
02:02 - new layer I'm just going to rename this
02:03 - layer to character and now we're
02:05 - actually ready to start painting and
02:07 - this is where a lot of Photoshop users
02:09 - often go wrong because normally in
02:11 - Photoshop you paint with the brush tool
02:13 - that's the
02:13 - over here you can also press B in order
02:15 - to quick select it but notice what
02:17 - happens if I try and paint with this we
02:19 - get this very smooth and blurred outline
02:21 - of course sometimes this is the effect
02:23 - that you're going for but again most of
02:25 - the time we want to paint with hard
02:26 - edges so let's undo this by pressing
02:28 - ctrl Z let's go to our brush tool and
02:31 - hold down this time you will now notice
02:33 - another tool here called the pencil tool
02:35 - now if we use this to draw the same line
02:37 - you can see that we get this very hard
02:39 - edge awesome just like with the brush
02:41 - tool we can always right click to change
02:43 - the size of our brush and to make it
02:44 - quicker to switch between sizes we can
02:46 - go and click on the tiny cog here and
02:48 - select basic brushes it's then going to
02:51 - ask you if you want to replace the
02:52 - current brushes with the basic brushes
02:54 - here we want to select ok you can now
02:56 - see that we can quickly click on the
02:57 - size that we want to use
02:59 - I mostly paint one pixel at a time so
03:01 - I'm gonna select the first one now we're
03:02 - gonna start placing pixels however a
03:04 - common thing to do before painting is
03:05 - choosing a cold color palette for this
03:08 - we'll use the color window at the top
03:09 - here we can double click on the top
03:10 - color in order to choose a color that we
03:12 - like and that's really two ways that we
03:14 - can save this one way is to hit add to
03:16 - swatches we then give it a name and
03:18 - press ok if we then go to the swatches
03:20 - palette and scroll to the bottom we can
03:22 - see or a new color but personally I like
03:23 - to have it within my canvas so I
03:25 - normally just paint the pixel in the
03:27 - color that I'd like a really good place
03:28 - to find cool color schemes is by going
03:30 - to color Adobe comm you can choose a
03:33 - primary color and it will then
03:34 - automatically generate colors to go with
03:36 - it we can switch between the way that it
03:38 - generates these colors over here or we
03:40 - could just rely on what other people
03:41 - have done before us to do that we're
03:43 - going to explore and you can see a bunch
03:45 - of different color schemes that you can
03:46 - choose from you can save these to your
03:48 - creative cloud account now I really like
03:50 - this sunset camping one I can press
03:51 - download and log in with my Adobe ID or
03:54 - I can just press the title and we now
03:55 - hover over each color to see the color
03:57 - code for my project I just want to use
03:59 - three symbol colors red black and white
04:01 - of course I can actually see the white
04:03 - right now to change that I'll go to my
04:05 - background layer I'll double click it to
04:06 - unlock it and give it a name I'm just
04:08 - gonna call it BG I'll then go to the
04:10 - left here and hold down on the gradient
04:12 - tool instead I want to get the paint
04:14 - bucket tool you can also just press G
04:16 - then we can select the color that we
04:17 - want our background to be I'm just gonna
04:19 - choose some kind of gray
04:20 - let's press in the middle of our canvas
04:22 - so now we have a more suitable
04:23 - background color and at this point I'll
04:25 - just select my character level
04:26 - speed to choose my pencil tool and I can
04:28 - start painting away to choose one of my
04:30 - colors I'll simply hold down alt and
04:32 - click on it if you make a mistake along
04:37 - the way and you want to erase it we
04:39 - simply need to use the eraser tool
04:41 - that's that one over here or we can
04:43 - simply press E if you then right-click
04:45 - we can of course change the size to 1
04:47 - but you can see if I start to erase here
04:48 - it does so gradually that's because just
04:51 - like our brush and pencil our eraser has
04:53 - two modes if you go to the top we can
04:55 - change the mode from brush to pencil and
04:57 - now we can erase the parts that we don't
04:59 - want so I'm just gonna fill in some more
05:00 - colors here alright so he's starting to
05:05 - come together but I still need to fill
05:07 - in these blank spaces with white to do
05:09 - that I'll hold down alt and press on my
05:11 - white color I'll then switched to the
05:12 - paint bucket tool by pressing G you can
05:15 - see if I try and fill out this hole now
05:16 - that our white will bleed on to
05:18 - surrounding pixels that's definitely not
05:20 - something we want of course it does this
05:22 - to try and avoid pixelation and ragged
05:24 - lines but in pixel art that's all we
05:26 - want
05:26 - so we'll go up to the top here and
05:28 - disable anti-alias now you can see that
05:30 - I can fill out all the spaces without it
05:32 - bleeding on to the surroundings you
05:33 - might also notice that the grid lines
05:35 - are suddenly very sharp that's because
05:37 - if we go to view show you can see that
05:39 - we have our grid enabled but the pixel
05:41 - grid is also enabled this grid enables
05:43 - whenever you soo-min close enough to an
05:45 - image and I personally don't like this
05:47 - so I'm just gonna disable it of course
05:49 - we can also disable our normal grid if
05:51 - you want to see your artwork without it
05:52 - I think that looks pretty good I'm not
05:54 - so sure that I like the red color though
05:56 - luckily just like with a normal image we
05:58 - can apply adjustments to our pixel art
06:00 - so I can simply go into the hue and
06:01 - saturation here and bump up the
06:03 - saturation I think that looks a lot
06:06 - better I mean then select this layer
06:07 - hold down shift and select our character
06:09 - as well let's then right click and hit
06:10 - merge layers to apply those changes when
06:13 - working on pixel art you often want to
06:14 - zoom in really far and it can be easy to
06:16 - lose track of your overall image
06:18 - therefore I like to go to window arrange
06:20 - and select new window for it pixel art
06:23 - this creates a second window showing our
06:24 - canvas right now it's hidden up here but
06:26 - if we click and drag we can place it
06:28 - anywhere in our interface I'm just gonna
06:30 - take mine here and place it over here
06:32 - and we now control the zoom level on
06:34 - this canvas individually and we now see
06:36 - changes in both windows as they occur
06:38 - finally when you're done with
06:39 - artwork we can press control 1 this will
06:42 - preview the canvas at a one-to-one pixel
06:43 - ratio of course for pixel art this makes
06:46 - it really really small that's fine if
06:47 - you want to export it to a game engine
06:49 - you want the images to be as small as
06:51 - possible because you don't want to use
06:53 - up any extra space but if you want to
06:54 - share this online or send it to your
06:56 - friends we probably want to make it a
06:57 - bit bigger
06:58 - first let's zoom in with a grid enable
07:00 - we'll press C in order to bring up the
07:02 - crop tool and we can now crop our canvas
07:04 - to fit our artwork when you're happy
07:06 - with the crop simply press Enter we now
07:08 - disable our gridlines again if you want
07:10 - you can disable the background to make
07:11 - it transparent I'm just gonna leave it
07:13 - on then to size up our image we'll go
07:15 - image image size here we can choose the
07:17 - new dimensions I'm gonna select pixels
07:19 - and a width and height of about 256 you
07:23 - will notice that this blows out our
07:24 - image quite a bit
07:25 - that's because Photoshop once again is
07:27 - trying to mess with us on the resembling
07:29 - we want to change it from automatic to
07:31 - that's right nearest neighbour and voila
07:32 - it's super crisp let's hit OK and our
07:35 - image is now really large again we can
07:37 - press ctrl 1 to view it in one-to-one
07:39 - that's a lot easier to see if we now
07:41 - want to export our image we can go file
07:43 - save as I'm gonna put mine on my desktop
07:46 - you can either save it as a Photoshop
07:47 - file if you want to keep the layers we
07:49 - can save it as a JPEG for a standard
07:51 - image that we can easily share do note
07:53 - that JPEG doesn't include transparent
07:55 - backgrounds if you want transparency you
07:57 - need to select PNG I'm just gonna choose
07:59 - jpg hit save set the quality to maximum
08:02 - and hit OK and now on my desktop we can
08:04 - see this pixel art JPEG image yay at
08:07 - this point it's all up to you to get
08:08 - creative and have fun that's pretty much
08:10 - it for this video I hope you found it
08:12 - useful most of the videos on this
08:13 - channel are focused around game
08:14 - development if you want to try making
08:16 - your own games I suggest starting here
08:18 - on that thanks for watching and I will

in this video we'll learn how to create pixel art in Photoshop we'll have a look at what tools to use and how to best configure Photoshop to suit your pixel needs special thanks to Han soft tune Zhu diamond and our Minoru C for their support on patreon and with that let's get painting so first we want to set up a canvas and configure it for pixel art to create a new canvas we'll go file new we'll give it a name say pixel art we'll change the unit to pixels and of course this is going to depend on the dimensions of what you want to make but remember we can always change this later I'm just
