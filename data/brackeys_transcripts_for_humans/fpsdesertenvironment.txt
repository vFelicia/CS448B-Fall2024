00:56 - to download as a zip file and when you
00:58 - unzip it you should get this folder
01:00 - inside that we have the models folder
01:02 - which contains all the individual FBX
01:05 - models as well as textures in case
01:07 - you're using unity I recommend your
01:09 - double clicking on the desert
01:10 - environment unity package this is going
01:12 - to set up and import everything
01:13 - including an example scene into Yanagi
01:16 - so you can check out all the elements
01:17 - that makes this pack it does include a
01:19 - few things from the standard assets
01:21 - folder so if you don't have that already
01:22 - it's going to import it
01:23 - let's hit input
01:26 - and you can see it created a desert
01:29 - environment folder inside this we have
01:30 - some stuff for the example seen all of
01:32 - our models neatly categorized and most
01:34 - importantly a prefabs folder which
01:36 - contains all these different props and
01:37 - models with material textures and
01:39 - colliders already set up I'm just going
01:41 - to go ahead and open the example scene
01:43 - here and right away we get this
01:44 - beautiful looking scene and if we go
01:46 - ahead and hit play we can see all the
01:47 - different moving parts in our scene we
01:49 - have a nice moving camera script we have
01:51 - the leaves of the trees here blowing in
01:53 - the wind we have some lights particle
01:55 - effects both for the fire and for the
01:57 - dust blowing by if we dump into the
01:59 - scene view here we can have a closer
02:00 - look at all of the different models
02:03 - again if you want to add a particular
02:04 - model to your scenes when you go into
02:06 - the desert environment go to prefabs
02:08 - find them all you want in my case I'm
02:10 - just going to take the generator here
02:11 - and simply drag it into the scene you
02:13 - can see that because we're using a PBR
02:15 - workflow everything is just going to
02:16 - blend right out the gate because
02:18 - everything is so detailed and set up to
02:19 - scale we should be able to just import a
02:21 - first-person controller I'm just going
02:23 - to go import package and then characters
02:25 - we can instantly go under the characters
02:27 - folder go on the first person character
02:29 - and drag one of these prefabs in I'm
02:31 - just going to take the rigidbody FPS
02:33 - controller here drag it in I'm also
02:35 - going to just move them up and rotate
02:37 - them a bit then replace the current
02:39 - camera with our main camera from this
02:41 - scene because this already has some
02:43 - nice-looking settings so just delete the
02:45 - old one
02:45 - make sure to reference the new one and
02:47 - on our camera I'm just going to disable
02:49 - depth of field we'll also just reset the
02:52 - transform of our camera and move it up
02:53 - say 0.6 and finally I'm just going to
02:56 - set our field of view to something like
02:57 - 60 and when we now hit play we should be
02:59 - able to move around the scene you can
03:01 - see some of the objects even have rigid
03:02 - bodies on them pretty cool right
