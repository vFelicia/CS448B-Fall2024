00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to the 24th
00:06 - video in our Survival game series done
00:08 - by Braes I am the CEO of Braes and in
00:11 - this video we're going to take a look at
00:13 - expanding on our time of day script to
00:16 - allow us to change the color of the
00:18 - water so it can fit in with the time of
00:21 - day so uh when it's night we're going to
00:24 - have like a dark water not that
00:27 - saturated and when it's bright uh or
00:30 - daytime we're going to have bright and
00:33 - uh colorful
00:34 - water so uh if we open up Unity you can
00:39 - see that a lot of things has changed
00:41 - here wow um I am currently working on a
00:46 - video where I do some time lapsing and
00:49 - then slow down uh certain parts of the
00:52 - video to show you what I've done here
00:54 - but basically I've just made a new
00:57 - terrain and uh don't worry every thing
01:00 - will be shown in the video it's going to
01:01 - be called uh Survival game level design
01:05 - uh 01 I think um so but I have sculpted
01:10 - and painted a new terrain uh I've added
01:13 - some water uh from the standard assets
01:17 - pack I've also made a path and I've
01:21 - included some of the uh different
01:24 - objects uh that we uh imported in the
01:27 - last tutorial so I've put some of them
01:30 - together and Chang them up a bit and
01:32 - I've also added some particles and some
01:34 - lights and some colliders here and there
01:37 - and so uh everything I've done here will
01:41 - again be explained in a future video so
01:45 - that's going to be really really awesome
01:48 - but for now let's just take a look at
01:50 - how it it looks so hit
01:54 - play and we can see it looks much better
01:57 - now we have much more detail we actually
02:00 - uh are starting to see a level uh
02:04 - shape uh type deal going on here uh so
02:07 - if we walk down to the water and and
02:09 - this is of course not the finished
02:11 - result uh the the level design video is
02:15 - probably going to be a whole series uh
02:17 - showing how I'm uh what I'm doing to
02:21 - expand on the level so if we walk down
02:23 - to the water uh right now it's it isn't
02:26 - looking too bad keep in mind that this
02:28 - is done with the free version of unity
02:31 - and so the water will never get to look
02:34 - really really awesome but uh we can make
02:37 - it look more awesome than this because
02:39 - if we change the slider to nighttime and
02:41 - look at the water it's almost like it's
02:44 - glowing and that's not really something
02:47 - we want and if we change it to like
02:51 - midday we can see that the water is then
02:54 - too dark so uh I just had to go uh with
02:57 - a property in between there so now let's
03:00 - actually modify our time of day script
03:03 - to allow us to change the color of the
03:07 - water so now let's go ahead and double
03:09 - click on our time of day
03:11 - script and so now let's go ahead and
03:13 - change this so um let me just bring my
03:17 - copy of this up on the other screen so I
03:19 - can see what we're doing okay
03:22 - so uh at the botton of the variable
03:25 - declaration here I want to create
03:27 - several new variables but first of I
03:30 - just want to type out some quick
03:31 - comments saying that this was added in
03:36 - tutorial
03:39 - number
03:42 - 24 it
03:46 - allows uh for
03:48 - changing the
03:50 - color that
03:52 - reflects
03:54 - of a water
03:58 - object and and just one more comment
04:01 - saying that
04:03 - uncheck include
04:06 - water if you are not
04:10 - interested in using this so basically
04:15 - what we're going to do now is we're
04:16 - going to create a variable that will
04:18 - store uh our water game object we are
04:21 - going to create a variable that will
04:23 - allow the user to decide or or rather
04:26 - you guys uh to decide whether not you
04:30 - want to actually use this feature so you
04:32 - can enable and disable it and uh then
04:35 - we're going to create two variables one
04:37 - that would will Define the W night color
04:40 - and one that will Define the W day so
04:43 - now let's go ahead and just do that so
04:45 - VAR v
04:48 - v uh game
04:52 - objects and so myON another one
04:56 - called uh include
04:58 - water
05:02 - it's going to be equal to false by
05:05 - default so you have to enable this
05:06 - feature as we will get a null reference
05:09 - if we haven't uh assigned anything to
05:11 - the game object and so it will just give
05:14 - us a bunch of Errors so uh the user or
05:17 - you guys have to decide whether not you
05:20 - want to use this before you assign
05:22 - stuff uh then we're going to have one
05:24 - called water KN which is going to be a
05:27 - type color and then a order day which is
05:31 - also going to be a type
05:34 - color so now save this out and now we
05:37 - should be able to go back into unity and
05:41 - see some variables appearing at the
05:43 - button here so we have the Warrior game
05:45 - object we have a checkbox if we want to
05:47 - include the water and we have then two
05:50 - color properties which you can just
05:52 - click and set or use the uh Color Picker
05:56 - here to choose anything from the
05:58 - scene
06:00 - so uh let's actually go ahead and set
06:03 - this up so let's drag in the start area
06:07 - water here so that's just the warrior
06:09 - object and of course you can make
06:12 - multiple of these variables and just
06:13 - assign it to all of them if you have if
06:15 - you have more than one uh uh water place
06:19 - or C or whatever uh so time of day and
06:24 - then drag in the start area water to the
06:27 - water variable hit the include water
06:30 - and uh now let's change the water night
06:33 - night to completely black and the water
06:36 - day to something
06:38 - like a bright blue I would say so
06:41 - something like
06:42 - that and again you can just go ahead and
06:45 - change uh change it to whatever you want
06:47 - uh that's completely up to
06:49 - you now let's go down to where uh
06:54 - actually let's go
06:57 - down to right under the sun. color
07:01 - equals color. lope and make some space
07:05 - and let's
07:07 - type uh let's actually com uh copy these
07:10 - comments down also so just so we're
07:14 - completely clear that people are
07:16 - understanding this and so
07:19 - if uh include
07:24 - water is equal to
07:28 - true
07:30 - then we want to do something
07:32 - here
07:35 - oops get a hold of the bracket keys
07:38 - there we go and what we want to happen
07:41 - is we want to take our
07:43 - water do
07:45 - renderer so the one that stores stuff
07:47 - like materials shaders and so on do
07:51 - material we want to access the material
07:54 - and we want to set a color for it so set
07:58 - color
08:00 - and then open up a parentheses and this
08:03 - is where we're going to access a Shader
08:06 - property and we have never talked about
08:09 - uh shaders and and scripting custom
08:11 - shaders and so on before but basically
08:14 - what a Shader property is is um it's a
08:20 - uh it's a variable for the Shader
08:23 - basically so it uh just like we can have
08:27 - um a checkbox and color stuff going on
08:31 - here we can have a property in a Shader
08:35 - called for example color or um blend
08:40 - amount
08:41 - reflectivity amount uh transparency and
08:45 - so on so uh we are simply going to type
08:47 - start
08:49 - parentheses and then
08:51 - underscore
08:53 - Horizon
08:56 - color comma and now we want want to set
08:59 - it so this is what it's called for the
09:02 - Shader that basic water uses and uh we
09:05 - can go ahead and find this inside of
09:07 - unit so we can go under our assets our
09:10 - day night no on our standard assets and
09:14 - this is where I have imported the uh
09:16 - water by press right clicking hitting
09:19 - import package and then water basic and
09:23 - if we import the water Pro we can see if
09:26 - this uses the same kind of Shader so if
09:29 - we just hit import on
09:34 - that and wait for it to import
09:38 - correctly should see it being done in a
09:41 - sec um so I really recommend that if
09:44 - this is not working for you you go ahead
09:46 - and check whether or not the property is
09:49 - called the same so if we go under the
09:50 - water basic select the day uh daylight
09:53 - symbol water we can see that it is using
09:56 - the water symbol shape
10:00 - and so under sources and under shaders
10:02 - we can see here the effects were symbol
10:06 - and there's a uh a category here called
10:10 - properties and the first one is indeed
10:12 - called Horizon color and we can see that
10:16 - it's a type color so if we go back uh we
10:21 - can see that the nighttime uh symbol
10:24 - water uses the same one and we can also
10:27 - see that if we go under our Pro
10:30 - and hit the daylight water it uses the
10:33 - effects water so if we go under sources
10:36 - here under shaders hit the effects water
10:41 - it is here called the let's see Horizon
10:45 - color there so that's also called
10:48 - Horizon color and uh we also have the
10:52 - water for and so on so you can go ahead
10:55 - and find it by doing this so go under do
10:57 - the different kinds of water here and
11:01 - changing that
11:02 - up so here I don't know if it's called
11:06 - Horizon but uh you can I'm sure you can
11:09 - find it on your
11:12 - own so let's delete out the water
11:16 - Pro go back to the water
11:20 - basic go under our time of day and now
11:23 - let's just uh finish the script up so
11:26 - Horizon
11:28 - color comma color.
11:34 - Lop parentheses water night comma water
11:42 - day comma slider 2 *
11:48 - 2 -
11:51 - 0.2 end up the parentheses and end with
11:54 - the
11:55 - semicolon so I won't go into too much
11:58 - detail here here but basically this line
12:01 - allows the color to lurp or fade between
12:05 - the water night and the water Day based
12:07 - on our slider
12:09 - values so now if we go in back into
12:13 - Unity hit the play
12:17 - button I can see we have an error so
12:20 - let's check that
12:21 - out vo base editor this is something to
12:25 - do with the word Pro which we en we
12:29 - import it so let's just go ahead and
12:30 - delete the editor version there too so
12:35 - go under the editor hit delete that so
12:40 - now that that's done we should be able
12:42 - to play the
12:44 - game indeed we are and if we walk down
12:47 - to the
12:49 - water and maybe change the speed
12:52 - variable of our time of day so go under
12:54 - our time of day and change this to
12:56 - something like 30 so we can see changing
12:58 - quickly
13:01 - you can see that the color of the water
13:03 - now fits the day much more nicely and
13:07 - everything Blends together it's not like
13:09 - it's shining and um and glowing so
13:14 - that's pretty much it for this video
13:16 - guys I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see
13:18 - you in the next
13:28 - one yeah

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to the 24th video in our Survival game series done by Braes I am the CEO of Braes and in this video we're going to take a look at expanding on our time of day script to allow us to change the color of the water so it can fit in with the time of day so uh when it's night we're going to have like a dark water not that saturated and when it's bright uh or daytime we're going to have bright and uh colorful water so uh if we open up Unity you can see that a lot of things has changed here wow um I am currently working on a video where I do some time lapsing and then slow down uh certain parts of the video to show you what I've done here but basically I've just made a new terrain and uh don't worry every thing will be shown in the video it's going to be called uh Survival game level design uh 01 I think um so but I have sculpted and painted a new terrain uh I've added some water uh from the standard assets pack I've also made a path and I've included some of the uh different objects uh that we uh imported in the last tutorial so I've put some of them together and Chang them up a bit and I've also added some particles and some lights and some colliders here and there and so uh everything I've done here will again be explained in a future video so that's going to be really really awesome but for now let's just take a look at how it it looks so hit play and we can see it looks much better now we have much more detail we actually uh are starting to see a level uh shape uh type deal going on here uh so if we walk down to the water and and this is of course not the finished result uh the the level design video is probably going to be a whole series uh showing how I'm uh what I'm doing to expand on the level so if we walk down to the water uh right now it's it isn't looking too bad keep in mind that this is done with the free version of unity and so the water will never get to look really really awesome but uh we can make it look more awesome than this because if we change the slider to nighttime and look at the water it's almost like it's glowing and that's not really something we want and if we change it to like midday we can see that the water is then too dark so uh I just had to go uh with a property in between there so now let's actually modify our time of day script to allow us to change the color of the water so now let's go ahead and double click on our time of day script and so now let's go ahead and change this so um let me just bring my copy of this up on the other screen so I can see what we're doing okay so uh at the botton of the variable declaration here I want to create several new variables but first of I just want to type out some quick comments saying that this was added in tutorial number 24 it allows uh for changing the color that reflects of a water object and and just one more comment saying that uncheck include water if you are not interested in using this so basically what we're going to do now is we're going to create a variable that will store uh our water game object we are going to create a variable that will allow the user to decide or or rather you guys uh to decide whether not you want to actually use this feature so you can enable and disable it and uh then we're going to create two variables one that would will Define the W night color and one that will Define the W day so now let's go ahead and just do that so VAR v v uh game objects and so myON another one called uh include water it's going to be equal to false by default so you have to enable this feature as we will get a null reference if we haven't uh assigned anything to the game object and so it will just give us a bunch of Errors so uh the user or you guys have to decide whether not you want to use this before you assign stuff uh then we're going to have one called water KN which is going to be a type color and then a order day which is also going to be a type color so now save this out and now we should be able to go back into unity and see some variables appearing at the button here so we have the Warrior game object we have a checkbox if we want to include the water and we have then two color properties which you can just click and set or use the uh Color Picker here to choose anything from the scene so uh let's actually go ahead and set this up so let's drag in the start area water here so that's just the warrior object and of course you can make multiple of these variables and just assign it to all of them if you have if you have more than one uh uh water place or C or whatever uh so time of day and then drag in the start area water to the water variable hit the include water and uh now let's change the water night night to completely black and the water day to something like a bright blue I would say so something like that and again you can just go ahead and change uh change it to whatever you want uh that's completely up to you now let's go down to where uh actually let's go down to right under the sun. color equals color. lope and make some space and let's type uh let's actually com uh copy these comments down also so just so we're completely clear that people are understanding this and so if uh include water is equal to true then we want to do something here oops get a hold of the bracket keys there we go and what we want to happen is we want to take our water do renderer so the one that stores stuff like materials shaders and so on do material we want to access the material and we want to set a color for it so set color and then open up a parentheses and this is where we're going to access a Shader property and we have never talked about uh shaders and and scripting custom shaders and so on before but basically what a Shader property is is um it's a uh it's a variable for the Shader basically so it uh just like we can have um a checkbox and color stuff going on here we can have a property in a Shader called for example color or um blend amount reflectivity amount uh transparency and so on so uh we are simply going to type start parentheses and then underscore Horizon color comma and now we want want to set it so this is what it's called for the Shader that basic water uses and uh we can go ahead and find this inside of unit so we can go under our assets our day night no on our standard assets and this is where I have imported the uh water by press right clicking hitting import package and then water basic and if we import the water Pro we can see if this uses the same kind of Shader so if we just hit import on that and wait for it to import correctly should see it being done in a sec um so I really recommend that if this is not working for you you go ahead and check whether or not the property is called the same so if we go under the water basic select the day uh daylight symbol water we can see that it is using the water symbol shape and so under sources and under shaders we can see here the effects were symbol and there's a uh a category here called properties and the first one is indeed called Horizon color and we can see that it's a type color so if we go back uh we can see that the nighttime uh symbol water uses the same one and we can also see that if we go under our Pro and hit the daylight water it uses the effects water so if we go under sources here under shaders hit the effects water it is here called the let's see Horizon color there so that's also called Horizon color and uh we also have the water for and so on so you can go ahead and find it by doing this so go under do the different kinds of water here and changing that up so here I don't know if it's called Horizon but uh you can I'm sure you can find it on your own so let's delete out the water Pro go back to the water basic go under our time of day and now let's just uh finish the script up so Horizon color comma color. Lop parentheses water night comma water day comma slider 2 * 2 0.2 end up the parentheses and end with the semicolon so I won't go into too much detail here here but basically this line allows the color to lurp or fade between the water night and the water Day based on our slider values so now if we go in back into Unity hit the play button I can see we have an error so let's check that out vo base editor this is something to do with the word Pro which we en we import it so let's just go ahead and delete the editor version there too so go under the editor hit delete that so now that that's done we should be able to play the game indeed we are and if we walk down to the water and maybe change the speed variable of our time of day so go under our time of day and change this to something like 30 so we can see changing quickly you can see that the color of the water now fits the day much more nicely and everything Blends together it's not like it's shining and um and glowing so that's pretty much it for this video guys I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one yeah
