00:00 - getting around unity is normally fairly
00:01 - easy however I found that knowing just a
00:04 - few shortcuts can really speed up
00:05 - development and open up for some handy
00:07 - features that aren't part of the UI so
00:10 - here are all the unity shortcuts that
00:11 - you need to know but first this video is
00:14 - sponsored by a skill share skill share
00:15 - is an online learning community with
00:17 - more than 19 thousand quality classes on
00:19 - design game development tech and more if
00:22 - for example you want to learn how to use
00:23 - game maker there's this awesome course
00:25 - on creating an RPG in game maker studio
00:27 - 2 throughout the course you'll be
00:29 - implementing stuff like tile sets a
00:31 - player and enemy and loot a premium
00:34 - skill share membership gives you
00:35 - unlimited access to all classes for less
00:37 - than $10 a month so to get started
00:39 - simply click the link in the description
00:41 - and the first 500 people will receive
00:43 - their first two months phone in $0.99
00:45 - all right back to the video let's begin
00:47 - by quickly getting scene navigation out
00:49 - of the way these are old left mouse to
00:51 - orbit old mill mouse to drag an old
00:53 - right mouse or scroll to assume I
00:56 - realize most of you probably know that
00:57 - already but it has to be sent you can
00:59 - also press f to focus on an object which
01:02 - is crazy useful and if the object is
01:04 - moving you can press F twice to follow
01:06 - it around now moving on to tools you can
01:09 - of course switch between the different
01:10 - transformation tools using shortcuts
01:12 - these are arranged neatly at the top of
01:15 - the keyboard and go q for hand tool W
01:17 - for move
01:18 - if rotate and R for scale you can access
01:21 - the rect tool using T and the new
01:23 - unified manipulation tool using Y
01:26 - personally I don't really use this tool
01:28 - as I've just gotten so used to switching
01:30 - between move rotate and scale myself by
01:32 - holding down ctrl together with these
01:34 - tools you can snap to the grid and
01:36 - holding down the V key you will snap to
01:39 - vertices and a lot of people don't know
01:41 - this but you can actually use Z and X to
01:44 - toggle between pivot modes and local
01:47 - versus world space so that's pretty cool
01:49 - in terms of playing the game you can
01:51 - press control P to toggle in and out of
01:53 - play mode and use control shift P to
01:56 - pause at any point also remember
01:58 - whenever we use ctrl on Windows that is
02:01 - command on a Mac if you want to you can
02:03 - also use ctrl alt P to go forward frame
02:06 - by frame if you want to play our game as
02:08 - a standalone we can press control shift
02:10 - B to bring up the build
02:12 - or just control be to quickly build and
02:15 - run the game as for editing objects you
02:17 - can use the usual commands for
02:19 - copy-paste and cut and on top of that
02:21 - you can use control D to duplicate and
02:24 - the Delete key to remove to search for a
02:27 - particular object use ctrl F inside the
02:29 - window you want to search in and if you
02:31 - just want to select all objects in the
02:33 - scene
02:33 - simply press ctrl a for all now all of
02:36 - that isn't very exciting but you can
02:38 - also create game objects using shortcuts
02:41 - to create an empty game object we use
02:43 - ctrl shift n + alt shift then to do the
02:46 - same but as a child of the selected game
02:49 - object we can also align an object with
02:51 - our current view using ctrl shift F is
02:53 - this all the time when trying to find
02:55 - nice camera angles simply find a good
02:57 - angle in the scene view select the
02:59 - camera and align with view it's awesome
03:02 - finally if you make a mistake during
03:04 - development you can always undo using
03:06 - ctrl Z and this is actually the only
03:08 - command that I know of that is different
03:10 - for mac and windows but to redo we use
03:13 - ctrl Y on Windows and command shift Z on
03:17 - Mac don't ask me why you can also use
03:19 - keyboard shortcuts to change the editor
03:22 - you can actually open editor windows by
03:24 - pressing ctrl + the corresponding number
03:27 - key to see a list of all the shortcuts
03:29 - simply go to the window tab and they
03:31 - should appear and maybe more importantly
03:33 - you can also maximize or minimize
03:35 - windows by whoring over a window and
03:37 - hitting shift space I use this all the
03:40 - time for focusing on a particular part
03:42 - of the editor and finally I just want to
03:44 - mention that we can of course press ctrl
03:46 - n to create a new scene ctrl s to save
03:48 - the current scene and ctrl shift s to
03:50 - save as and that pretty much concludes
03:52 - the list of keyboard shortcuts that I
03:54 - use when making games in unity hope you
03:56 - remember them I've created this unity
