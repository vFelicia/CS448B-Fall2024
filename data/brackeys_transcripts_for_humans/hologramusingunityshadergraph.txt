00:00 - a really cool effect that is used pretty
00:01 - often in both games and movies is the
00:04 - hologram in this video we'll have a look
00:06 - at how to create this effect in unity
00:08 - using shader graph towards the end we
00:10 - should have something like this and
00:12 - that's with pretty much anything that we
00:13 - make in shader graph we can really
00:14 - easily tweak it to make different
00:16 - results and yes we are using this lovely
00:18 - monkey again you could say that I am
00:20 - bananas for this model
00:26 - alright enough monkeying around let's
00:29 - get into the video also special thanks
00:31 - to Michael Neely Clinton fans Kira vo
00:33 - Infiniti PBR cheetah 3d and Alex and the
00:36 - player for their support on patron and
00:37 - with that let's get to it so we're here
00:40 - in the same symbol scene as always all
00:42 - we have is a camera two lights a bit of
00:45 - post processing as well as this monkey
00:48 - model and on this monkey of course we
00:50 - have a material that just uses standard
00:53 - settings so let's go ahead and create a
00:55 - new shader that's right-clicking the
00:57 - project go create let's go under shader
00:59 - and select PPR graph we'll name it
01:01 - something like hologram let's double
01:04 - click it to open it up in shader graph
01:05 - and I'm just going to maximize the you
01:07 - window here I'm also going to take the
01:08 - preview and dark it to the right and
01:11 - it's also move over a bit and now we're
01:13 - ready to start sculpting our shader and
01:15 - the first thing that I want to do is
01:17 - just be able to control the base color
01:19 - of our hologram right now we can do that
01:21 - here in the albedo channel but let's
01:23 - just go ahead and create a property for
01:25 - this so we'll go to the plus sign select
01:27 - color and we'll call this base color I'm
01:30 - gonna go ahead and pick some kind of
01:32 - color let's just try out a light green
01:35 - maybe and that's then take this property
01:37 - and plug it right into the albedo
01:39 - Channel and we can now see that our
01:41 - object is green next we want to use a
01:43 - texture to control the transparency of
01:46 - our object to do that we of course need
01:48 - to specify a texture so we're go ahead
01:50 - and create another property this time of
01:52 - type texture and we'll call it something
01:54 - like hologram texture and we can go
01:57 - ahead and choose a default texture here
01:59 - I've prepared two textures beforehand a
02:01 - hologram lines cool and a hologram lines
02:04 - simple I've discussed like the cool one
02:06 - right away but I'm gonna show you how
02:08 - different textures can affect the look
02:10 - of our hologram later and just to give
02:12 - you an idea of what these textures look
02:14 - like we can have a look at them here so
02:16 - the simple one is basically just a bunch
02:18 - of gradients stacked on top of each
02:21 - other this is super simple to create in
02:23 - a program like Photoshop we could even
02:25 - create this procedurally but it's just
02:27 - easier to supply a texture the second
02:29 - one is pretty much the same thing but
02:31 - I've gone ahead and made way more lines
02:33 - and I've also taken logic gradients and
02:36 - overlaid them on top this creates a much
02:38 - more complicated
02:39 - texture but I think it also makes the
02:41 - hologram look a lot cooler so jumping
02:44 - back into shadowgraph
02:45 - we are now ready to start using this
02:47 - texture if we just drag it into a
02:49 - workspace here we really just want to
02:51 - plug it directly into the alpha channel
02:53 - of our PBR node however remember we
02:56 - can't actually do this because the Alpha
02:59 - Channel takes in a different type than a
03:00 - texture so we first have to convert our
03:03 - texture and we do this using a sample
03:05 - texture node so to take the output of
03:07 - our texture we'll search for a sample
03:09 - texture there we go we can now see the
03:11 - texture being displayed here and we can
03:14 - finally take this and input it into our
03:16 - alpha now we won't see anything
03:18 - happening on our object just yet but
03:20 - that's because we need to change the
03:22 - surface from opaque to transparent and
03:24 - voila this already kind of starts to
03:27 - look like a hologram we can also
03:29 - right-click on a preview and choose a
03:31 - custom mesh and I'm just gonna select
03:32 - our monkey here just so we get a better
03:34 - idea of what this looks like so as we
03:37 - can see right now our texture is kind of
03:38 - being overlaid on top of the UV of our
03:41 - monkey and that's what we want for
03:43 - almost all textures we want a certain
03:45 - part of the texture to correspond to a
03:47 - certain part of our model however in our
03:49 - case we really just want these lines to
03:51 - kind of scroll down a monkey not
03:54 - relative to the model but relative to
03:56 - our view luckily we can change the UVs
03:59 - that our sample texture uses to do this
04:02 - we'll go ahead and create another node
04:04 - will search for tiling and offset and
04:07 - here we have a bunch of control over our
04:09 - URIs we can tile them we can offset them
04:11 - and we can do something pretty cool that
04:13 - I'll show you in a sec so let's just
04:15 - link this up to the UVs of our sample
04:16 - texture and let's now take the input
04:18 - you've ease of our tiling and offset
04:20 - node here and let's plug in a screen
04:23 - position and right away we can see that
04:25 - our hologram lines change to now be
04:28 - overlaid kind of from the perspective of
04:30 - our screen and they're not wrapping
04:32 - around the sides of our model pretty
04:35 - cool we can go ahead and minimize this
04:37 - view here we really don't need that and
04:39 - drag it over we and also controlled the
04:41 - tiling of our texture here so if we
04:42 - wanted to tile it on the Y for example
04:45 - we can do that and I think it would be
04:47 - pretty neat if we could control this
04:49 - from within the editor so let's go ahead
04:51 - and create a vector to
04:53 - let's call it a hologram texture tiling
04:56 - let's just set the X to 1 and the Y to
05:00 - something like 3 the same numbers we
05:02 - have here let's drag it into a workspace
05:04 - and let's hook that up to the tiling
05:06 - input channel and now here comes the
05:08 - cool part because just like we
05:10 - controlled the tiling we can of course
05:12 - also control the offset and if you go
05:14 - ahead and offset on the Y we can
05:16 - actually see that we kind of have this
05:18 - effect where our lines are scrolling
05:20 - down our model and instead of setting
05:23 - this manually we can have this change
05:25 - over time so we'll go ahead and create a
05:28 - time node here we can take the current
05:30 - time of our game and if we just plug it
05:32 - directly into the offset we can see that
05:34 - the lines are scrolling right away of
05:37 - course it would be nice if we could
05:38 - control the speed of this so we'll go
05:40 - ahead and remove this connection and
05:42 - just create a quick multiply node in
05:44 - between so we'll create a multiply here
05:47 - and that will go from time into the
05:49 - offset and we don't want to multiply by
05:52 - two we want to be able to control this
05:54 - speed up here so we'll go ahead and
05:56 - create a vector one we'll call this the
05:58 - scroll speed let's set it to something
06:01 - like point 1 by default drag it down
06:03 - here and let's plug that right into the
06:06 - second channel off our multiply node and
06:08 - now we can see that we have these nice
06:10 - scrolling lines that are slowly moving
06:12 - down our monkey pretty darn cool
06:15 - I'm just gonna reorganize the notes a
06:18 - tiny bit here just to try and keep
06:19 - everything nicely tied together and that
06:22 - is kind of the first part of our effect
06:24 - in fact we could stop here if we just
06:26 - save this jump into unity and select our
06:29 - monkey material we're going to shader
06:31 - and graphs and select our hologram we
06:34 - can see that already it actually looks
06:36 - quite decent and if we play we should
06:38 - see that the texture is indeed animating
06:41 - and if you just want a very kind of
06:43 - low-key hologram effect this could be it
06:46 - we'd go ahead and change the base color
06:48 - to say a light blue and you can see that
06:51 - we can easily control the look of our
06:53 - hologram this way also if we go ahead
06:55 - and select a different texture for
06:56 - example if we select these simple
06:58 - hologram lines we can very easily change
07:00 - the look of a hologram pretty
07:01 - drastically so I definitely recommend
07:03 - that you try and create your own
07:05 - textures and see
07:06 - what comes out on the other end so I'm
07:08 - just gonna change this back to the cool
07:10 - lines and let's try and kind of beef
07:12 - this effect up by adding some glowy
07:14 - parts so one thing that I really think
07:16 - could benefit this effect is a tiny bit
07:18 - of friend L let's open up a hologram and
07:20 - maximize it let's just go to the top
07:23 - here and we'll create a simple color
07:25 - node we'll change the mode to HDR so
07:28 - that we can make it glow I'm just gonna
07:30 - select some kind of pretty bright orange
07:32 - here and for the intensity I'm gonna set
07:34 - this all the way to something like four
07:36 - or five we can then also create a final
07:38 - node so we will create it for now effect
07:40 - and again we need to move this up a bit
07:42 - more and we've used this effect before
07:44 - in the introduction video and you can
07:46 - see that it just creates this cool
07:48 - radial ramp we can change the power here
07:50 - to modify the effect I'm just gonna set
07:52 - that to something like three let's then
07:54 - multiply this with our color so we'll
07:56 - output this into a multiply node and
07:59 - we'll also put the other one and we
08:01 - should get something like this we then
08:03 - take the final output here and drag it
08:06 - into the emission flood of our PBR
08:08 - master node and this looks pretty weird
08:10 - in the preview because it's not
08:12 - necessarily set up for HDR but if we go
08:14 - ahead and save this asset and have a
08:16 - look at it in our scene this is actually
08:19 - really bright so we can go in here and
08:20 - it's actually create the ability for us
08:22 - to modify this from within the editor so
08:25 - that's right click on the color node and
08:27 - it's converted to a property and so it
08:28 - pops up in our blackboard and we can go
08:30 - ahead and rename this to something like
08:32 - for nail color and there we go and let's
08:36 - now modify this to have a much lower
08:38 - intensity so we'll just set it to one
08:40 - for now and let's save the asset and
08:42 - that looks much nicer actually I think
08:45 - one might be a bit too small but luckily
08:47 - we can now adjust it from in here
08:49 - I'm just gonna try setting it to
08:51 - something like three so right away I
08:53 - think that helps our hologram pop a lot
08:54 - more and also think it helps bring out
08:56 - kind of the 3d feel of our object so
08:58 - that it's not completely flat but
09:00 - there's definitely still more that we
09:02 - can do with this if we go back to our
09:04 - shader I want to try and use these lines
09:06 - to add some emission as well in fact
09:09 - let's try taking the output of our
09:11 - sample texture here and we still want to
09:13 - feed this into the Alpha but let's
09:15 - create another output
09:16 - we're going to plug this into another
09:18 - node and I
09:19 - on a one- note here which is simply
09:21 - going to take the texture and invert it
09:23 - and then take the output of this and
09:25 - multiply it together with our base color
09:27 - let's create a multiply node here and
09:31 - let's also take our base color and drag
09:33 - it into the output and I want this to go
09:36 - into the emission as well so let's go
09:38 - ahead and add these two emissions
09:40 - together let's remove this connection
09:42 - here and instead we can maybe take this
09:44 - entire branch here and move it out a
09:47 - tiny bit just to create some more room
09:48 - we now take the output off our for
09:51 - another fact feed it into an add node
09:53 - take the output from here and feed it
09:55 - into our secondary input and we can now
09:57 - see that the two are kind of overlaid on
09:59 - top of each other
10:00 - finally let's go from this add node here
10:02 - and it's feed that into our emission on
10:05 - the PPR master if we say that and
10:07 - preview it inside of unity I think it
10:10 - actually looks a lot nicer for me at
10:13 - least
10:13 - using the emission for some of the lines
10:15 - as well makes it feel like the hologram
10:17 - is actually part of a scene and it makes
10:20 - the hologram look much brighter and
10:21 - vibrant of course it completely depends
10:23 - on the look that you're going for I'm
10:25 - also going to go in here and definitely
10:27 - give our Fornell a tiny bit more
10:29 - intensity and now if we had play I think
10:31 - a hologram looks super cool and that's
10:34 - pretty much all I did for the effect
10:35 - shown in the intro the only thing that I
10:37 - added on top was a tiny bit of
10:39 - flickering light and making that it's
10:41 - actually pretty easy let me just quickly
10:43 - show you how it could be done
10:49 - [Music]
10:53 - [Applause]
10:59 - [Music]
11:02 - so this is pretty much how all I did was
11:05 - create a time note and feed that into
11:07 - the seed channel of a random range this
11:10 - means that every frame we get a random
11:11 - number between 0 and 1 which creates
11:14 - this crazy flickering I then used a
11:16 - comparison node to see if this
11:18 - flickering is greater than point 9 and
11:20 - it's not really drawing the UI properly
11:22 - for me here right now but we can choose
11:24 - here whether or not we want to check if
11:26 - it's equal less or greater and of course
11:28 - Cho is greater here and this plugs
11:30 - directly into a branch node and it says
11:32 - if it is greater than 0.9 we're going to
11:34 - output a value of 1 and otherwise we're
11:36 - going to output a value of 0.8 just so
11:39 - are flickering won't be too crazy and
11:40 - this outputs into a multiply node where
11:43 - we multiply it together with our
11:44 - original emission and this of course
11:46 - feeds into the emission channel of our
11:48 - master node so if we say that and play
11:50 - that inside of unity we can see that our
11:53 - hologram kind of flickers every once in
11:55 - a while I might have gone a bit
11:56 - overboard with the effect here but I
11:57 - wanted to show you how that looks like
11:59 - you can of course fine tune the effect
12:01 - and the values to your liking yay

Cleaned transcript:

a really cool effect that is used pretty often in both games and movies is the hologram in this video we'll have a look at how to create this effect in unity using shader graph towards the end we should have something like this and that's with pretty much anything that we make in shader graph we can really easily tweak it to make different results and yes we are using this lovely monkey again you could say that I am bananas for this model alright enough monkeying around let's get into the video also special thanks to Michael Neely Clinton fans Kira vo Infiniti PBR cheetah 3d and Alex and the player for their support on patron and with that let's get to it so we're here in the same symbol scene as always all we have is a camera two lights a bit of post processing as well as this monkey model and on this monkey of course we have a material that just uses standard settings so let's go ahead and create a new shader that's rightclicking the project go create let's go under shader and select PPR graph we'll name it something like hologram let's double click it to open it up in shader graph and I'm just going to maximize the you window here I'm also going to take the preview and dark it to the right and it's also move over a bit and now we're ready to start sculpting our shader and the first thing that I want to do is just be able to control the base color of our hologram right now we can do that here in the albedo channel but let's just go ahead and create a property for this so we'll go to the plus sign select color and we'll call this base color I'm gonna go ahead and pick some kind of color let's just try out a light green maybe and that's then take this property and plug it right into the albedo Channel and we can now see that our object is green next we want to use a texture to control the transparency of our object to do that we of course need to specify a texture so we're go ahead and create another property this time of type texture and we'll call it something like hologram texture and we can go ahead and choose a default texture here I've prepared two textures beforehand a hologram lines cool and a hologram lines simple I've discussed like the cool one right away but I'm gonna show you how different textures can affect the look of our hologram later and just to give you an idea of what these textures look like we can have a look at them here so the simple one is basically just a bunch of gradients stacked on top of each other this is super simple to create in a program like Photoshop we could even create this procedurally but it's just easier to supply a texture the second one is pretty much the same thing but I've gone ahead and made way more lines and I've also taken logic gradients and overlaid them on top this creates a much more complicated texture but I think it also makes the hologram look a lot cooler so jumping back into shadowgraph we are now ready to start using this texture if we just drag it into a workspace here we really just want to plug it directly into the alpha channel of our PBR node however remember we can't actually do this because the Alpha Channel takes in a different type than a texture so we first have to convert our texture and we do this using a sample texture node so to take the output of our texture we'll search for a sample texture there we go we can now see the texture being displayed here and we can finally take this and input it into our alpha now we won't see anything happening on our object just yet but that's because we need to change the surface from opaque to transparent and voila this already kind of starts to look like a hologram we can also rightclick on a preview and choose a custom mesh and I'm just gonna select our monkey here just so we get a better idea of what this looks like so as we can see right now our texture is kind of being overlaid on top of the UV of our monkey and that's what we want for almost all textures we want a certain part of the texture to correspond to a certain part of our model however in our case we really just want these lines to kind of scroll down a monkey not relative to the model but relative to our view luckily we can change the UVs that our sample texture uses to do this we'll go ahead and create another node will search for tiling and offset and here we have a bunch of control over our URIs we can tile them we can offset them and we can do something pretty cool that I'll show you in a sec so let's just link this up to the UVs of our sample texture and let's now take the input you've ease of our tiling and offset node here and let's plug in a screen position and right away we can see that our hologram lines change to now be overlaid kind of from the perspective of our screen and they're not wrapping around the sides of our model pretty cool we can go ahead and minimize this view here we really don't need that and drag it over we and also controlled the tiling of our texture here so if we wanted to tile it on the Y for example we can do that and I think it would be pretty neat if we could control this from within the editor so let's go ahead and create a vector to let's call it a hologram texture tiling let's just set the X to 1 and the Y to something like 3 the same numbers we have here let's drag it into a workspace and let's hook that up to the tiling input channel and now here comes the cool part because just like we controlled the tiling we can of course also control the offset and if you go ahead and offset on the Y we can actually see that we kind of have this effect where our lines are scrolling down our model and instead of setting this manually we can have this change over time so we'll go ahead and create a time node here we can take the current time of our game and if we just plug it directly into the offset we can see that the lines are scrolling right away of course it would be nice if we could control the speed of this so we'll go ahead and remove this connection and just create a quick multiply node in between so we'll create a multiply here and that will go from time into the offset and we don't want to multiply by two we want to be able to control this speed up here so we'll go ahead and create a vector one we'll call this the scroll speed let's set it to something like point 1 by default drag it down here and let's plug that right into the second channel off our multiply node and now we can see that we have these nice scrolling lines that are slowly moving down our monkey pretty darn cool I'm just gonna reorganize the notes a tiny bit here just to try and keep everything nicely tied together and that is kind of the first part of our effect in fact we could stop here if we just save this jump into unity and select our monkey material we're going to shader and graphs and select our hologram we can see that already it actually looks quite decent and if we play we should see that the texture is indeed animating and if you just want a very kind of lowkey hologram effect this could be it we'd go ahead and change the base color to say a light blue and you can see that we can easily control the look of our hologram this way also if we go ahead and select a different texture for example if we select these simple hologram lines we can very easily change the look of a hologram pretty drastically so I definitely recommend that you try and create your own textures and see what comes out on the other end so I'm just gonna change this back to the cool lines and let's try and kind of beef this effect up by adding some glowy parts so one thing that I really think could benefit this effect is a tiny bit of friend L let's open up a hologram and maximize it let's just go to the top here and we'll create a simple color node we'll change the mode to HDR so that we can make it glow I'm just gonna select some kind of pretty bright orange here and for the intensity I'm gonna set this all the way to something like four or five we can then also create a final node so we will create it for now effect and again we need to move this up a bit more and we've used this effect before in the introduction video and you can see that it just creates this cool radial ramp we can change the power here to modify the effect I'm just gonna set that to something like three let's then multiply this with our color so we'll output this into a multiply node and we'll also put the other one and we should get something like this we then take the final output here and drag it into the emission flood of our PBR master node and this looks pretty weird in the preview because it's not necessarily set up for HDR but if we go ahead and save this asset and have a look at it in our scene this is actually really bright so we can go in here and it's actually create the ability for us to modify this from within the editor so that's right click on the color node and it's converted to a property and so it pops up in our blackboard and we can go ahead and rename this to something like for nail color and there we go and let's now modify this to have a much lower intensity so we'll just set it to one for now and let's save the asset and that looks much nicer actually I think one might be a bit too small but luckily we can now adjust it from in here I'm just gonna try setting it to something like three so right away I think that helps our hologram pop a lot more and also think it helps bring out kind of the 3d feel of our object so that it's not completely flat but there's definitely still more that we can do with this if we go back to our shader I want to try and use these lines to add some emission as well in fact let's try taking the output of our sample texture here and we still want to feed this into the Alpha but let's create another output we're going to plug this into another node and I on a one note here which is simply going to take the texture and invert it and then take the output of this and multiply it together with our base color let's create a multiply node here and let's also take our base color and drag it into the output and I want this to go into the emission as well so let's go ahead and add these two emissions together let's remove this connection here and instead we can maybe take this entire branch here and move it out a tiny bit just to create some more room we now take the output off our for another fact feed it into an add node take the output from here and feed it into our secondary input and we can now see that the two are kind of overlaid on top of each other finally let's go from this add node here and it's feed that into our emission on the PPR master if we say that and preview it inside of unity I think it actually looks a lot nicer for me at least using the emission for some of the lines as well makes it feel like the hologram is actually part of a scene and it makes the hologram look much brighter and vibrant of course it completely depends on the look that you're going for I'm also going to go in here and definitely give our Fornell a tiny bit more intensity and now if we had play I think a hologram looks super cool and that's pretty much all I did for the effect shown in the intro the only thing that I added on top was a tiny bit of flickering light and making that it's actually pretty easy let me just quickly show you how it could be done so this is pretty much how all I did was create a time note and feed that into the seed channel of a random range this means that every frame we get a random number between 0 and 1 which creates this crazy flickering I then used a comparison node to see if this flickering is greater than point 9 and it's not really drawing the UI properly for me here right now but we can choose here whether or not we want to check if it's equal less or greater and of course Cho is greater here and this plugs directly into a branch node and it says if it is greater than 0.9 we're going to output a value of 1 and otherwise we're going to output a value of 0.8 just so are flickering won't be too crazy and this outputs into a multiply node where we multiply it together with our original emission and this of course feeds into the emission channel of our master node so if we say that and play that inside of unity we can see that our hologram kind of flickers every once in a while I might have gone a bit overboard with the effect here but I wanted to show you how that looks like you can of course fine tune the effect and the values to your liking yay let's pretty much it for this
