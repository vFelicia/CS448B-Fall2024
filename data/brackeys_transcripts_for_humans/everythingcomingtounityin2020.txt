With timestamps:

00:00 - - So your night Copenhagen
just got wrapped up
00:02 - and that means that Unity
held their official keynote
00:04 - as well as a roadmap talk on
their plans for the future.
00:07 - Luckily, we got to participate.
00:09 - So here's, what's coming to Unity in 2020,
00:12 - but first this video is
sponsored by Zenva Academy.
00:15 - If you've ever thought
about creating an RPG,
00:17 - I really recommend you go
check out their RPG Academy.
00:20 - Featuring 13 complete courses
containing 29 hours of
00:23 - on-demand content.
00:25 - It covers everything from coding basics
00:27 - to customising avatars,
00:28 - turn-based battle systems,
00:30 - map and quest systems
procedurally generated dungeons,
00:33 - and much more.
00:34 - Zenva is as an authorised unity partner
00:36 - and RPG Academy has been
extensively reviewed
00:39 - and authorised by Unity themselves.
00:41 - With a onetime payment,
00:42 - you get access to course videos,
00:43 - project files, PDF notes, offline access,
00:46 - and in course support
by expert instructors.
00:49 - And by using the coupon code
brackeys you get 15% off,
00:52 - simply click the link in the
description to get started.
00:54 - Also, special thanks to InfinityPBR
00:56 - for his support on patron.
00:57 - Now let's start with the Keynote.
00:59 - Here Lucas jumped right into the deep end,
01:01 - by showing off some improvements to DOTS,
01:03 - Specifically, in terms of making it easier
01:05 - to read and code for.
01:07 - Remember, DOTS is just a word for ECS,
01:10 - the C sharp Job System,
and Burst combined.
01:13 - And if you don't understand what that is,
01:15 - that's totally fine.
01:16 - Just remember that
whenever we're saying DOTS,
01:18 - what we're really referring
to is just a new technology
01:21 - that is a new way of thinking
about how to code in Unity
01:24 - that is also insanely much
faster than the old one.
01:28 - After that Yo Kim came on stage
01:29 - for some reason not wearing a pink shirt.
01:32 - Anyway, he started off by
showing some editor improvements
01:35 - that automatically convert game objects
01:37 - to runtime optimised entities.
01:39 - As you can see,
01:40 - we now have a preview
of this in the inspector
01:42 - that updates automatically
01:43 - to any changes that we
make on the game object.
01:45 - He then went on to show
01:46 - an FP assembled project
built on top of DOTS.
01:49 - And I think this was a really big step
01:51 - because it's the first time
that we're seeing a project
01:53 - that nicely combines all these
different engine features,
01:56 - built specifically for DOTS.
01:58 - It's using the new Unity physics,
02:00 - which are made for DOTS,
02:01 - and it's running on the new FPS net code,
02:04 - which is also made for DOTS.
02:06 - According to Yo Kim,
02:07 - the new net code makes it easy
02:08 - to build solid multiplayer FPS games
02:11 - and it has features like
client side prediction,
02:13 - lag compensation, and
interpolation all built in.
02:16 - The project also uses the
new Unity animation package,
02:19 - again, of course, built for DOTS.
02:21 - And notice how they're using IKS
02:23 - to adjust the position of
the feet to the environment.
02:27 - Pretty cool.
02:27 - And the best thing is
that the project is built
02:29 - with the purpose of
being easy to understand.
02:32 - And I think that's really important
02:34 - because I think a lot of
people, myself included,
02:37 - still have many unanswered
questions when it comes to DOTS.
02:40 - And right when it couldn't
get much more exciting,
02:42 - they showed off Live Link.
02:44 - With Live Link you can make
changes to your built games
02:47 - from inside the Unity editor at runtime.
02:50 - This is incredibly useful,
02:52 - and it's going to speed up my
development process so much,
02:55 - especially when working
on multiplayer games
02:57 - where you often have many
clients running at the same time.
03:00 - Now all of this is shipping
as preview packages in 2019.3.
03:04 - They also showed off some of the 2D tools.
03:06 - Now a lot of it we've
definitely seen before.
03:08 - However, I was really excited
to see dynamic 2D shadows.
03:12 - Of course,
03:12 - they in general just showed
a lot of cool stuff coming
03:14 - in the next version of Unity, 2019.3,
03:18 - but I'm going to save most of this
03:19 - for a what's new video,
03:20 - dedicated to going over the new version.
03:22 - In this video, I want to focus
on what we can expect to see
03:25 - in the coming year, because there's a lot.
03:28 - Finally, in the keynote,
03:28 - they of course showed off the continuation
03:30 - of the heretic demo and it
was really, really cool.
03:33 - (dramatic music)
03:41 - Now this year Unity actually took place
03:42 - in our home city, Copenhagen,
03:44 - which meant that we got to take part
03:45 - in all the fun activities and events
03:47 - that Unity were hosting that week.
03:49 - We had some round table
meetings with Unity,
03:51 - which were extremely productive and fun.
03:54 - And we had some dinners
where we got to meet
03:55 - a lot of awesome people.
03:57 - In general, it was just
a lot of fun meeting,
03:59 - other content creators who were there
04:00 - and of course, just hanging
out in the expo hall.
04:03 - And now what we've all been
waiting for the roadmap talk,
04:06 - which did definitely not disappoint.
04:07 - So first of all, the asset pipeline
04:09 - is being rebuilt to be much faster,
04:11 - including on-demand import
04:13 - where assets are imported
only as you need them.
04:16 - This should eliminate
a lot of the load time
04:18 - when opening new projects.
04:19 - I'm just curious to see if
it leads to any wait times
04:22 - in the editor itself.
04:23 - And talking about the editor,
04:24 - we're going to see major
speed improvements in 2020.1.
04:27 - Finally selecting large
quantities of objects
04:30 - will be a breeze.
04:31 - This is something that I
could definitely have used
04:33 - when creating our Unity
stress test videos,
04:35 - so it's nice to see that
it's being worked on.
04:38 - In terms of graphics,
04:39 - 2D light and shadows should
be production ready 20.2
04:42 - with experimental soft
shadows coming in 20.1.
04:45 - Along with that is an eye shadow for HDRP
04:48 - and a deferred renderer for URP.
04:50 - That's right, the
Lightweight Render Pipeline
04:52 - is being renamed to
Universal Render Pipeline.
04:54 - Definitely a more suiting name,
04:55 - considering Unity is working
04:56 - towards making this distended renderer.
04:58 - Sometime in 2020,
05:00 - we will also be getting visual texturing
05:02 - or texture streaming.
05:04 - This is a performance optimization,
05:05 - where Unity takes a high quality texture,
05:08 - chops it up into little bits,
05:10 - and effectively only renders the parts
05:12 - that the player is seeing.
05:13 - Think of it like occlusion
calling for textures,
05:16 - pretty cool.
05:17 - In 2020.1, the audio engine is
also being rebuilt for DOTS,
05:21 - and we will be able to enter prefab mode
05:23 - in the context of the scene.
05:25 - Entities is also becoming
production ready.
05:27 - Why this isn't called DOTS here?
05:29 - I have no idea.
05:30 - And of course you can't
have a roadmap talk
05:32 - without mentioning visual scripting.
05:34 - Luckily we are getting close
with a promise preview in 20.1.
05:38 - It seems to be built with
non-programmers in mind,
05:41 - which I definitely think it should,
05:42 - but it also has support for custom nodes,
05:44 - which the programmer in me really likes.
05:47 - Of course we could talk about
visual scripting forever,
05:49 - and we're definitely going
to be making lots of content
05:51 - on it, but until then,
05:53 - here are some of the
features that we can expect.
05:55 - (gentle upbeat music)
05:57 - In 2019.3, we are also getting
a full editor redesign.
06:01 - I'll definitely be going
into more detail on this
06:03 - in our what's new video,
06:05 - but something that I'm really glad to hear
06:06 - is that Unity has plans
06:08 - for bringing more tools
into the scene view in 2020.
06:11 - This is so incredibly needed
06:13 - in terms of making some of
these creative packages,
06:15 - like terrain, tile map, pro grids,
06:17 - and pro builder feel more
integrated with the editor.
06:20 - And talking about UI,
06:22 - in 2020 Unity is bringing UI elements
06:24 - to the runtime as well.
06:25 - UI elements is a way to build
UI using CSS like styling.
06:30 - It includes a new UI builder,
06:32 - and I definitely see why
this is an improvement
06:34 - for the editor,
06:35 - but I'm really curious as to how
06:36 - this is going to work together
with the current UI system.
06:39 - Are they going to work
alongside each other?
06:41 - When are we going to use what?
06:43 - I don't know, but I'm
pretty excited to find out.
06:45 - (upbeat music)
06:49 - In terms of animation,
06:49 - we are getting a lot of updates in 20.1,
06:52 - including free form animation,
06:54 - which allows you to modify
bone based animation
06:56 - and even edit motion capture data.
06:59 - Basically, it just
looks like a huge update
07:01 - to working with real characters in Unity.
07:03 - On top of that, Kinematica,
07:05 - the AI based animation system
is being released in preview.
07:09 - Moving on, I'm still
excited for a quick search,
07:11 - which is currently available as a package
07:13 - and will hopefully soon be
integrated with the editor.
07:15 - And in 20.1, the package manager
07:17 - can now be used to directly
publish to the asset store.
07:20 - It's nice to see these two
systems start to be merged
07:23 - in a meaningful way.
07:24 - At this point in the roadmap,
07:25 - Will went on to talk about
the environment system,
07:28 - not the terrain system,
the environment system.
07:31 - Now I'm going to be totally honest here
07:32 - and admit that I have
no idea what that is.
07:35 - Neither does anyone else it seems.
07:37 - But apparently it allows
you to build terrain
07:39 - by combining game objects
in a layer like structure.
07:43 - What exactly that means
I'm not totally sure,
07:45 - but I'm definitely intrigued. (laughs)
07:49 - Project Tiny is scheduled for 2020
07:51 - with no specific data insight.
07:52 - However, Unity is working on
bringing 3D to Project Tiny,
07:56 - which is pretty cool.
07:57 - Now a really big feature
07:58 - that is coming already later this year
08:00 - is the Unity Distribution Portal.
08:02 - This basically enables you
to distribute your game
08:05 - to a bunch of different
stories using a single hub,
08:08 - which just sounds like such a
quality of life improvement.
08:11 - And finally, in terms of networking,
08:13 - we are getting DOTSNnetcode in 20.1.
08:16 - DOTS, mh, net code, mh,
networking, oh, multiplayer, yeah.
08:21 - In the beginning, it's a simple framework,
08:23 - mainly focused on server
authoritative architecture,
08:25 - but Unity we'll be expanding on this later
08:27 - to provide other net code solutions
08:29 - for other types of games
like fighting games,
08:32 - strategy games, and so on.
08:33 - What I'm mainly curious
about is first of all,
08:35 - how he sees this going to be to use,
08:37 - and how's this going to be
implemented into the editor?
08:40 - Is it going to be just programming
08:41 - or are we going to see a
component based approach,
08:44 - like we did with Unit
08:45 - for helping people quickly set up,
08:46 - basic multiplayer functionality?
08:48 - I guess time will tell.
08:49 - We can also expect to see
multi-play matchmaking,
08:51 - later this year
08:52 - with flexible matchmaking
for multiplayer GAMES,
08:55 - latency matching as well as backfill.
08:58 - in the first quarter of 2020,
08:59 - they're also adding support
for parties and lobbies,
09:02 - which is great.
09:03 - Now that's pretty much all the features
09:05 - we could squeeze into this video.
09:06 - If you want to learn more,
09:07 - we'll have a link to the keynote,
09:09 - as well as the roadmap
talk in the description.

Cleaned transcript:

So your night Copenhagen just got wrapped up and that means that Unity held their official keynote as well as a roadmap talk on their plans for the future. Luckily, we got to participate. So here's, what's coming to Unity in 2020, but first this video is sponsored by Zenva Academy. If you've ever thought about creating an RPG, I really recommend you go check out their RPG Academy. Featuring 13 complete courses containing 29 hours of ondemand content. It covers everything from coding basics to customising avatars, turnbased battle systems, map and quest systems procedurally generated dungeons, and much more. Zenva is as an authorised unity partner and RPG Academy has been extensively reviewed and authorised by Unity themselves. With a onetime payment, you get access to course videos, project files, PDF notes, offline access, and in course support by expert instructors. And by using the coupon code brackeys you get 15% off, simply click the link in the description to get started. Also, special thanks to InfinityPBR for his support on patron. Now let's start with the Keynote. Here Lucas jumped right into the deep end, by showing off some improvements to DOTS, Specifically, in terms of making it easier to read and code for.
