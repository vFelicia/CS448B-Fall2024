00:27 - over the past few days we've been

00:32 - there are a few that we would like to
00:33 - show in this video so without further
00:35 - ado let's have a look at my favorite
00:37 - games from the second practice game jam
00:38 - but first this video is sponsored by

01:11 - by simply clicking the link in the
01:12 - description and the first 500 people
01:14 - will receive their first two months for
01:16 - free so the theme for the jam was love
01:18 - is blind and I'm really impressed with
01:20 - how many unique games you guys were able
01:22 - to come up with based on this theme take
01:24 - for example the game note to self which
01:26 - is about a person who is so in love that
01:28 - he has literally gone blind and you have
01:30 - to help him get safely to his
01:32 - destination I think this game is cool
01:34 - because instead of controlling a
01:35 - character you are manipulating the world
01:37 - around him and also the menu and
01:39 - cutscenes are just amazing another
01:41 - example of guiding the player on his
01:43 - path to love is my love is blind here
01:46 - you have to guide your love home using
01:47 - your voice
01:50 - gameplay-wise this works by moving the
01:53 - player in the direction of your mouse
01:54 - when clicking however it's not only the
01:56 - player that reacts to your voice also
01:59 - enemies and platforms which means that
02:01 - you suddenly have to plan out when and
02:03 - where to use it the game combines that
02:05 - with some really great audio work and
02:06 - it's just an overall fun experience and
02:08 - talking about audio sightless is a game
02:11 - where you essentially use sound to
02:13 - reveal the world around you things like
02:15 - movement shooting and shouting will
02:16 - enhance your vision but also attract
02:18 - enemies it felt to me like a fusion of
02:21 - superhot and the horror game perception
02:23 - which worked really well the only thing
02:25 - I would change about this game is to
02:27 - make the levels a tiny bit less
02:28 - complicated and the jump puzzles easier
02:30 - since I often found myself getting stuck
02:32 - but after playing white Heights I was
02:35 - starting to think that it might just be
02:36 - my jumping skills that are subpar this
02:39 - is a game by the same guy who made last
02:40 - gleam for the previous gem and man this
02:43 - one blew me away the gameplay is fast
02:45 - paced the music is thrilling and the
02:47 - graphics are as crazy as they are cold
02:50 - and on the subject of crazy have you
02:52 - ever wondered what would happen if you
02:53 - went Sambi fishing with a brain as bait
02:55 - I have but I didn't think I would find
02:57 - the answer here in the pide fishermen of
03:00 - Hamelin your task is to lead all the
03:02 - zombies out of the city your only friend
03:04 - a fishing rod I guess there's not much
03:06 - more to say about that now one of the
03:08 - games that struck me the most is heart
03:10 - bound in this game you help these two
03:12 - robots find love on their endless
03:14 - journey into the unknown and I think
03:16 - that's exactly what the graphics in the
03:18 - game feel like endless the way that the
03:21 - platform's fade into nothingness and the
03:23 - paths that just keeps continuing
03:24 - smoothly from one level to the next
03:26 - makes the world feel large with very few
03:28 - elements the game also begins with an
03:31 - incredibly simple yet effective tutorial
03:33 - in fact I think a lot of the games did a
03:35 - really good job on introducing the game
03:37 - to the player take for example the menu
03:39 - for now I see I think it does two things
03:42 - very well first it helps set the
03:44 - atmosphere of the game but more
03:46 - importantly it teaches the player the
03:48 - main mechanic before the game even
03:50 - starts I really like this detail because
03:52 - menus are often quickly thrown together
03:54 - it should just be a place where you
03:55 - configure settings so it's nice to see
03:57 - this one working so well so if you've
03:59 - ever wondered what a guy madly in love
04:01 - looks like just take a look
04:03 - at the character from why do you love I
04:05 - absolutely love this character and the
04:07 - gameplay is super fun a bit much blood
04:09 - for a love game but to be honest the
04:11 - animations and sound effects are half
04:13 - the fun and I think it was generally
04:15 - really impressed with the amount of work
04:16 - you guys were able to put into graphics
04:18 - and detail the game for you I'll become
04:21 - a hero is a cyclic story based
04:23 - platformer and I just can't believe how
04:26 - much these two guys were able to do in a
04:28 - week's time the game has tons of
04:29 - beautiful sprites cutscenes a menu a
04:32 - very large level a shop with cool items
04:34 - and even a progression system pretty
04:37 - much the only thing for me that gave
04:38 - away that this was a jam game is the
04:40 - fact that the movement felt a bit clunky
04:42 - but still great job guys another game
04:45 - that really caught me off guard was love
04:47 - machine first of all the concept is
04:49 - extremely well done the game is about a
04:51 - machine from outer space that tries to
04:53 - learn how to love and by analyzing human
04:56 - behavior it concludes that we as a
04:58 - species are incredibly fond of violence
05:01 - because of this it starts killing
05:02 - Earthlings to improve its love or level
05:05 - of violence expertise now that's of
05:08 - course a good wordplay but the best
05:10 - wordplay of the jam and perhaps of all
05:12 - time I give to you significant order
05:15 - extremely cute and also followers it's a
05:19 - super fun and very dangerous game if you
05:21 - don't watch out you might end up
05:23 - spending hours just trying to beat your
05:24 - high score it reminds me a lot of cross
05:27 - the road which I have spent so much time
05:28 - on back in the days I really like the
05:31 - idea of getting more and more followers
05:32 - the only problem was I didn't really
05:34 - understand exactly what they were good
05:35 - for except serving as extra lives
05:37 - perhaps implement a bonus based on how
05:40 - many followers she crossed the road with
05:41 - super fun game and man did it feel
05:43 - awesome running through all the cars as
05:45 - ghosts now I am puzzled pun intended by
05:48 - hot Ronin I was by the puzzle game
05:50 - television it is super innovative as you
05:53 - have to turn on and off your vision in
05:55 - order to get past the guards and safely
05:57 - reach your true love at the top of the
05:59 - tower
05:59 - the graphics are what they are but for
06:01 - some reason they kind of grew on me if I
06:03 - were to change one thing it would be the
06:05 - number of steps you are able to take
06:06 - while blind since often you can take
06:08 - more steps than needed to complete the
06:10 - level this would make the game harder
06:11 - and force the player to find the
06:13 - shortest possible path and talking about
06:15 - paths love is blind is a store
06:17 - for princess trying to find the path
06:19 - transitions trial of before it's too
06:21 - late it's as well written as it is drawn
06:24 - and the atmosphere had me captivated
06:26 - from start to end as a reviewer said
06:28 - this one really captured the feeling of
06:29 - blindly stumbling around a dungeon and
06:31 - talking about blindly stumbling around
06:33 - dungeons this next game has exactly
06:35 - nothing to do with that does however
06:37 - have something to do with teamwork all I
06:39 - see is you is the only co-op game we
06:41 - decided to feature it splits the screen
06:43 - into two and the players are forced to
06:45 - guide each other through the level what
06:46 - makes this amazing is that you have to
06:48 - completely rely on your partner's
06:50 - directions since you're totally blind on
06:52 - your half of the screen actually that is
06:54 - kind of like blindly stumbling around
06:56 - the dungeon that transition just kind of
06:58 - wrote itself has checked nice heart
07:00 - Quest is a throwback to old retro
07:02 - platformers and I personally really
07:04 - enjoyed the aesthetic what impressed me
07:05 - about this game was how varied the
07:07 - levels were I've been playing for good
07:09 - while jumping around onto this starry
07:10 - night sky and then suddenly everything
07:12 - was on the ground and claustrophobic
07:14 - super cool I also want to mention the
07:17 - game make a weird heart first of all
07:19 - what second of all yeah that's been much
07:23 - the feeling I had when playing this game
07:25 - the graphics and sounds are really cool
07:27 - and for some reason don't ask me why I
07:29 - was quite amused to in playing this one
07:31 - it's a no rules make what you want a bit
07:33 - type of game another game I had a lot of
07:35 - fun with is bullet heart it's just a
07:37 - very solid bullet hell game clean
07:39 - graphics snappy controls and a mechanic
07:41 - that allows you to slow down the game
07:43 - with the trade-off that you start to see
07:44 - less of the screen one it's also
07:46 - frustratingly hard but in the good way
07:48 - and finally we have the last thing she
07:50 - saw this is a game about a photon making
07:53 - it to someone's eyes while listening to
07:55 - her story it's a symbol and really solid
07:57 - platformer that was challenging but not
07:59 - too hard and the story kept me engaged
08:01 - from start to end and that's pretty much
08:03 - all the games we have time to cover in
08:05 - this video of course there are so many
08:07 - amazing games that we haven't talked
08:08 - about so I definitely encourage you to
