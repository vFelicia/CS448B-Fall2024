00:03 - Hello, everyone and welcome to the first video in make a game a short series where I'm going to cover
00:11 - The basics of making a video game and it's going to be a lot of fun. So this is for you who thought [hmMm]
00:17 - I want to make a game. I've got a cool idea. I want to get into the business it sounds cool anything [like] that
00:25 - You don't need any knowledge to begin out with on the matarese
00:30 - So we'll cover everything and it's going to be a lot of fun. So let's get started [in] [this] video
00:36 - I'll just
00:37 - explain what tool we are going to be using and why and
00:40 - Then I'll move on to showing you where you can get it, and we'll also be starting up a project and just getting the basic
00:48 - Elements in there, so just really really the basics of everything
00:54 - Cool, so first off. We are going to be using unity 3D, or it's not really called 3D by unity and
01:02 - The reason why is that it's a very
01:05 - [well] known, so you're going to be [able] to find lots of documentation [onto] how on how to do several things
01:12 - it's also very beginner friendly and
01:15 - Still a lot of experts and professionals use it because it's fast and it can create
01:22 - Really powerful things in a very short amount of time
01:26 - So it's really the engine of fun if you still want to do a lot and maybe even do some scripting
01:33 - Unity is really really great and lot of it can [be] achieved using visual stuff
01:39 - Cool, so let's go to unity 3D comm then head under the download section
01:46 - hit download
01:48 - [okay], so now we can just go ahead and hit download unity 4.2. It might have changed since this video and
01:55 - We are going to be using the free [version] of unity which is still really powerful
02:01 - But there is also a pro version with the black skin here. Which has more advanced features
02:08 - but for beginners and even intermediate users most likely
02:14 - That's not something you're going to need that bad so hit the download unity 4.2
02:19 - and it will download I already have the have it installed, so let's just close this and
02:25 - I've opened up unity already
02:27 - and this is just a quick preview of what kind of game [you're] going to be making it's a ball rolling game and
02:34 - If we just hit play [here]
02:39 - You can see that. I can roll the ball to each side and the camera will follow and I can jump and
02:47 - That's the basics of what we are going to be making in the next few tutorials
02:51 - We might expand onto that we're definitely going to create some more interesting level design. This is really boring
02:58 - But that's really the basics of the game
03:02 - Okay, so go up to file hit new project and you
03:07 - [might] be prompted to do this when opening unity
03:11 - Then you can select the project location. I'm going to do browse here, and then go into Dropbox
03:18 - I like to store everything in Dropbox so I can keep a backup of my project
03:23 - then make a new folder and call this make a
03:29 - game
03:32 - select that and
03:34 - Now we get to select what packages we want to include
03:38 - these are [other] default packages these contain stuff like a
03:44 - First-Person controller for First-person games which you can just
03:49 - Import into the game and it will work already without any scripting. So these are just packages unity made for us
03:56 - Which we don't have to make on our own
03:58 - [I] have a little more than usual, but that's because I've downloaded some extra from the unity asset store
04:06 - [ok] so right now. We are fine with what we have we have we might
04:12 - Use the physics materials in a future tutorial
04:15 - Along with stuff like sky boxes, but we can always import [these] later. I like to keep the project clean and tight
04:23 - Now let's hit create
04:26 - Now unity is going to load up all of the files running in the background, and this is how it should look
04:33 - We can see that. There are a bunch of different windows
04:36 - I'm just going to go over them [quickly] as I don't want to get this to get too boring
04:41 - First off we have the scene view this is where we can see all objects and navigate around
04:46 - To navigate a route the scene view [I] use the alt button
04:51 - This is really going to do all navigation for you. So if you hold down old we can click and
04:57 - if and drag and we can pan around stuff if we use alt and shift
05:04 - Or holding [cTRL]. Sorry we can drag and
05:08 - if we use the zoom
05:10 - Scroll wheel we can zoom in on things if you find that you get lost in the scene view
05:17 - We can go up to the right hand side and [click] the center of the cube this will change from perspective
05:24 - to iso, and So on
05:26 - If you are not familiar with camera technology you can just [ignore] this
05:33 - Then we have [the] different axes which we can click to quickly snap to side views front views and so on
05:43 - Cool over here on the left hand side. We have the hierarchy this is all this this shows all of the objects in our scene
05:51 - Right now we only have the main camera, and that's just drawing drawing a blue color
05:57 - Then we have the game view and this is where we want to be when we are testing out [our] game
06:03 - Then we have the inspector which shows all [of] the different things you can change
06:08 - Once you have something selected in the hierarchy or the project pane, so that's basically the [settings] tab
06:16 - Then we have failed to load which we are just can ignore
06:20 - Then we have we have the project pane
06:22 - And then here we are going to see all [of] the different things in our project which we can choose to have
06:28 - Inside of this particular scene scenes are like levels so this
06:33 - Stores Data for all the levels and this is from this particular level
06:39 - then we have stuff like the console where you can see error messages if you have made mistakes and scripts and
06:45 - The animator which we are going to ignore for now
06:49 - Cool you can also switch between different kinds of tools over here in the left hand side
06:55 - to get this grid showing you can click on this landscape and
07:00 - Disable it and enable it once. This is enabled the grid will disappear
07:06 - Cool
07:08 - Now let's actually get started creating an object
07:11 - so let's go to game object create other and then let's choose the
07:18 - Cube
07:20 - we can see over here in the right [hand] side on the transform that our cube currently has a
07:28 - position of 3.9 on the x
07:32 - 0.1 on the y, and
07:35 - 5.6 on the Z
07:38 - we want to just zero out this transform, so simply type 0
07:43 - 0 and 0 in those three fields
07:48 - We can also hit f while hovering over the scene view to focus on our Cube
07:55 - This is handy for quickly finding items because we can just [select] them in our hierarchy and then hit f to focus on them
08:04 - Now that the position of our cube is centered. We should be able to see it in the game view
08:10 - It's very boring at the moment then. It's just a square and also. It doesn't have any light applied to it
08:17 - Let's change the scale of this to make [it] more exciting and then apply lights
08:22 - so if we go back [to] the scene view
08:25 - We can change the scale to
08:27 - 10 on the x
08:30 - 1 on the y and 1 on the z
08:34 - We're going to look at it from the side so we don't really want too much going on on the z axis
08:41 - the Blue One and
08:43 - the y is fine with one
08:47 - Now we can add a sphere which is going to be our main character our ball
08:54 - So go to game object
08:56 - create other
08:58 - select sphere
09:00 - now let's zero out the position x y and z and
09:06 - Then just drag it up to rest on top of the Cube
09:11 - Give it a little more than necessary, so [we] assure it won't drop through
09:17 - Now that we have this set up let's rename the objects to stay organized so go over in the hierarchy
09:24 - Right click on the objects and hit rename or select them and go to the inspector
09:29 - over here by this [check] [box]
09:33 - The check box is where we can disable and enable objects?
09:38 - Now let's type out a name. We're going to call this ball. You can call it
09:43 - Whatever you want make sure that you notice that unity is kept sensitive
09:48 - so that you don't leave spaces all around and
09:52 - That you are you are consistent with when you put a capital letter and a small letter
09:59 - Now select the cube hit rename for that also let's call this ground
10:07 - Then our main camera. We can also rename this
10:11 - oops
10:13 - Wrong one the main camera. I'm just going to do main camera, but without the space
10:20 - Now that we have this [setup]. We can go ahead and play our game
10:24 - but nothing will happen
10:27 - So that's not that exciting
10:30 - [still] so let's add a light so we can finally see what's going on this looks all very two-dimensional
10:38 - So go to game object create other
10:41 - point light
10:43 - There are many different types of lights
10:45 - point Lights emit from one single point in space
10:49 - out
10:50 - through this radius also called the range it has different properties like color and
10:58 - intensity which you can feel free to mess around with
11:03 - Shadows are not going to work unless you have the probe
11:06 - They only work for directional lights, and they only work in hard shadows
11:12 - But that's fine to play around with
11:15 - So let's just move this to make it look a little bit eerie so first let's center it
11:21 - So make sure we know where it is in space
11:23 - then let's drag it up and
11:26 - A bit out towards the camera so you can see more what's going on. You can also drag on these [dots] to adjust the range
11:35 - It's a good [idea] to keep it soft and nice looking like this
11:40 - Now that we have that we can also rename
11:44 - That so let's call this light
11:47 - Zero one you're probably going to have many lights in our scene before [we] done
11:53 - so this was the basics of
11:56 - Unity3d
11:57 - [we're] also going to talk about what is a component?
12:00 - what's a game object and of course through some simple scripting to get our ball moving and
12:07 - unfolding, [we're] also going to
12:10 - Expand on the level design and maybe even do something with coins or pickups or something
12:17 - So collectible objects are always fun stay tuned for future videos, and I hope you enjoyed it
12:23 - [I'll] see you in the next video
