00:00 - so while back we did a video on my top
00:02 - ten favorite unity tips well we see the
00:04 - 10 and we ratio by 90 that's right we're
00:08 - kicking off the New Year with 100 cool
00:10 - you needed tips and tricks that
00:11 - hopefully is going to make your life a
00:12 - whole lot easier about 100 bits easier
00:16 - to be exact
00:17 - also a huge thanks to all of you who've
00:19 - been checking out line of code to those
00:21 - of you who don't know we just launched a
00:23 - game dev clothing store and we're just
00:25 - really excited about it so if you
00:26 - haven't checked it out yet head on over
00:28 - to the line of code IO let's of course I
00:30 - think for that in the description all
00:32 - right 100 unity tips here we go so first
00:36 - tip you can change back to the old
00:37 - selection outline by going on the gizmos
00:39 - and turning on selection wire next you
00:41 - can use the pixel perfect camera
00:43 - component to get super crisp pixel art
00:45 - make sure to first install the package
00:46 - in the package manager
00:48 - you can sort sprites based on their
00:49 - y-value by going to the graphics menu in
00:51 - the project settings and setting the
00:53 - transparency sort mode to custom axis
00:55 - and the Y value to one if you want to
00:57 - destroy a game object but would like to
00:59 - wait a few seconds you can insert a
01:01 - delay as a second parameter if you right
01:03 - click on a shader and create a material
01:05 - it will create a material based on that
01:06 - shader and name it accordingly you can
01:08 - use runtime initialization onload method
01:11 - to execute code in your scripts without
01:13 - having to create an empty game object
01:15 - with a mono behavior copy components
01:17 - while in play mode and paste them back
01:19 - when not playing to save changes to
01:21 - randomly get a variable that is either
01:23 - true or false simply use this short
01:25 - statement consider using structs instead
01:27 - of classes when storing just a few
01:29 - variables because they can live in the
01:30 - stack which eliminates garbage
01:32 - collection right the beginning of the
01:33 - statement in your script and double
01:35 - press tab to generate the rest start a
01:37 - quarantine within another co-routine
01:39 - using this code snippet the animation
01:41 - window can be used to animate pretty
01:43 - much everything the cool thing is that
01:44 - this includes parameters in your own
01:47 - custom scripts you can use control a to
01:49 - select everything in the animation
01:50 - window and then F to frame it all you
01:53 - can use C to toggle curve view and K for
01:55 - keyframe in the animator you can reverse
01:57 - an animation by setting the speed to
01:59 - minus 1 when comparing a distance
02:01 - don't use vector three the distance
02:03 - instead subtract the two points and use
02:05 - square magnitude then square the number
02:07 - you want to compare with this saves a
02:09 - square root call which is really slow
02:11 - use text mesh instead of the fall
02:13 - text objects to get way more control and
02:16 - much crisper text at all sizes mark
02:18 - private variables with serialized field
02:20 - to make them appear in the inspector
02:21 - while still being private if you want to
02:23 - hide a public variable without making it
02:25 - private market with hiding the inspector
02:27 - use the formerly serialized as attribute
02:30 - to rename a field without losing its
02:32 - serialized value you can add folder
02:34 - shortcuts into your unity project to
02:35 - easily be able to open folders that you
02:37 - often use focus on an object by
02:40 - selecting it and pressing F first F
02:42 - twice if you want to follow the object
02:43 - around match the game camera to the
02:45 - scene view by selecting the camera in
02:47 - the hierarchy and pressing control shift
02:48 - F when comparing two tags try to avoid
02:51 - the double equals it's more performant
02:53 - to use the compared tag method you can
02:55 - use empty game object as dividers in
02:57 - your hierarchy to help organize your
02:59 - objects if you want to find all objects
03:01 - with a particular component just search
03:03 - for it in the hierarchy in project
03:05 - search
03:06 - t : scene shows only scenes T :
03:09 - textures shows only textures and so on
03:12 - pretty cool for quickly finding objects
03:13 - of a certain type use alt + arrow up and
03:17 - down to quickly move lines without
03:19 - having to copy and paste quickly
03:21 - navigate to the documentation for a
03:22 - component by hitting the book in the
03:24 - upper right corner do you need to know
03:26 - when something changed and how then go
03:28 - to the documentation versions to get
03:30 - links to termination for all previous
03:32 - unity versions hold down alt while
03:34 - expanding an object in the hierarchy to
03:36 - expand all child objects as well the
03:39 - same applies to collapsing unity is
03:41 - completely customizable you can move
03:43 - around windows until you're happy then
03:45 - save your settings as a new layout by
03:47 - going to edit preferences color you can
03:49 - adjust editor colors including the
03:51 - background color of the scene view you
03:53 - can also make the editor change color
03:54 - when playing the game by adjusting the
03:56 - play mode tint this is great so you
03:58 - don't forget that the game is running
03:59 - you can choose what effects to show in
04:01 - the scene view by going under the
04:03 - landscape drop-down at the top want to
04:05 - be able to quickly call a certain
04:06 - function simply use the menu item
04:08 - attribute to assign a function to a new
04:10 - menu item at the top of the unity editor
04:12 - and use the context menu attribute to do
04:14 - the same thing but adding the function
04:16 - to the context menu instead split up
04:19 - your object into layers to easily be
04:20 - able to toggle them on and off in the
04:22 - scene you can also lock layers to avoid
04:24 - accidentally moving objects that you
04:26 - don't want to select
04:27 - when creating layers or tax you can use
04:30 - a slash to create submenus to make it
04:32 - easier to organize your project use
04:34 - project settings player other settings
04:36 - and then scripting defined symbols to
04:38 - add global c-sharp defined to your
04:40 - project these can be used to omit or
04:42 - include code when compiling you can use
04:45 - the color picker to get colors outside
04:47 - of unity itself and copy-paste works on
04:50 - colors use Shift + space to maximize a
04:52 - window use the system that serializable
04:55 - attribute to be able to see an edit
04:56 - classes and structs in the inspector
04:58 - change which layers collide with which
05:01 - by going under physics and changing the
05:03 - collision matrix also this is how
05:05 - different colliders interact when all on
05:07 - the same layer if I had to get something
05:09 - to - down my body this might be it you
05:11 - can do math calculations inside of
05:13 - number fields in the inspector no need
05:15 - to bring out a calculator unity also
05:17 - allows you to lock the inspector this is
05:19 - especially useful if you open a second
05:21 - inspector because it allows you to copy
05:23 - values between two objects really
05:24 - quickly well set the 50 mark I think it
05:28 - was that calls for a sip of water well
05:37 - let's continue the drop down menu at the
05:39 - top of the inspector has a debug mode
05:41 - option when enabled this will display
05:43 - all variables including private ones
05:45 - when you sync debug that lock you can
05:47 - add a game object as a second attribute
05:49 - this will highlight the game object in
05:51 - the scene when clicking on the lock you
05:53 - can use simple styling in debug logs to
05:55 - spider up your console messages
05:56 - sometimes when you have a variable that
05:59 - changes over time it would be great if
06:01 - you could just see it on a graph luckily
06:03 - we can use animation curves to achieve
06:05 - this fairly easily using this code
06:06 - snippet you can quickly add a new script
06:08 - by pressing add component typing the
06:11 - name of the script and hitting Enter
06:12 - twice unity can read save files from
06:15 - programs such as Photoshop or blender
06:17 - and Maya no need to export to another
06:19 - format first to keep individual
06:21 - Photoshop layers when importing into
06:22 - unity simply save as a PSP file instead
06:26 - this does require you to install the PSD
06:28 - importer from the package manager assign
06:30 - gizmos to objects using the inspector
06:33 - choose your own custom gizmos by
06:35 - selecting other enable and disable
06:37 - gizmos categorically from the scene view
06:39 - you can do this for the game view as
06:41 - at the top the code hell plus au plus
06:44 - space plus world creates a lot of
06:46 - strings and memory garbage use string
06:48 - builder for concatenating multiple
06:50 - strings more effectively create your own
06:52 - editor objects using scriptable objects
06:54 - this is great for organizing game data
06:56 - like items or achievements in the
06:58 - Preferences window you can choose what
07:00 - happens when the script changes while
07:01 - playing pretty cool since a lot of the
07:03 - time weird stuff happens when you just
07:04 - continue playing you can easily extend
07:06 - the unity editor to add your own custom
07:08 - windows with tools and overviews we have
07:11 - a video on this I recommend you watch if
07:12 - you've never tried it out it's a lot of
07:14 - fun and if you don't want to create a
07:16 - whole new window you can simply create a
07:17 - custom inspector this way you can change
07:19 - how you display components in the editor
07:21 - to add buttons display more information
07:22 - and so on we of course have a video on
07:25 - that as well you can use the qwe rnt
07:28 - keys to click the swap between tools and
07:30 - you can actually use the rect transform
07:32 - tool to scale 3d objects it's perfect
07:34 - for scaling from bounce instead of
07:36 - around the pivot holding ctrl while
07:38 - moving an object snaps to position to
07:40 - full world units for more snapping
07:42 - options go to edit snap settings hold me
07:44 - to grab and drag objects by their
07:46 - vertices as well snap them to other
07:48 - vertices reduce C sharp compile-time by
07:51 - creating your own managed assemblies
07:52 - right-click in the project select
07:54 - assembly definition and move it to the
07:56 - folder you want now all scripts inside
07:58 - that folder will be compiled to this
07:59 - assembly yield return new waitforseconds
08:01 - one will never stop if time that time
08:04 - scale is set to zero to change this use
08:07 - wait for seconds real time instead you
08:10 - can store references to components that
08:11 - you're going to be using a lot in
08:13 - private variables to save on performance
08:15 - this is called caching never use camera
08:18 - main it literally does this behind the
08:21 - scenes oh the horror
08:22 - if you're using a lot of non-changing
08:24 - strings in your code you can use static
08:26 - read-only string to avoid allocating a
08:28 - bit of memory each time they're quite a
08:30 - few attributes that make your inspector
08:32 - life a lot easier here the ones that I
08:34 - use the most range allows you to create
08:36 - a slider that goes between the min and
08:37 - Max value space adds an empty space
08:40 - hello creates a tiny bit of text tooltip
08:42 - changes the tooltip when hovering over a
08:44 - variable now when visiting the asset
08:46 - store you can do so both using a web
08:48 - browser or from within the editor you
08:50 - can drag and drop one scene onto another
08:52 - to merge them easily duplicate
08:54 - an object by hitting ctrl D we also use
08:57 - the same command to duplicate array
08:58 - items you can use presets to save
09:00 - configurations for your components
09:02 - simply use the sliders in the corner to
09:04 - choose between presets or create a new
09:06 - one to loop over all direct children of
09:08 - an object use this code snippet use
09:11 - transform that set sibling index to
09:13 - change the order of objects in the
09:14 - hierarchy by a script save your current
09:16 - selection by going edit selection and
09:19 - choosing a number you can then load back
09:21 - the selection from the same menu or
09:23 - using the shortcut use regions to create
09:26 - collapsible sections in your code watch
09:28 - out this is a slippery slope that leads
09:30 - to very long scripts you can pause the
09:32 - editor at a specific moment during
09:33 - runtime by setting editor application
09:35 - that is passed to true the frame skip
09:38 - button next to pass can be used to
09:40 - proceed one frame at a time use the game
09:42 - stats window for a quick overview over
09:44 - your game statistics for more in-depth
09:46 - look at performance use the profiler
09:48 - window and you can use this code snippet
09:50 - to measure the execution of a function
09:52 - in the profiler get a closer look at
09:54 - what you are inspecting by
09:55 - right-clicking on the upper part of the
09:57 - preview to undock it and it will then
09:59 - act as any other window need a quick
10:01 - break from your games audio simply hit
10:03 - the mute button in the game view
10:04 - monobehaviour that invoked repeating
10:06 - does not stop repeating on the activated
10:09 - game objects go to window frame debugger
10:11 - to see a breakdown of how each frame is
10:14 - rendered you can also visualize physic
10:16 - shapes using the physics debugger it's
10:18 - great for spotting errors in colliders
10:19 - and finally for tip number 100 don't
10:23 - make an MMORPG
10:25 - seriously don't there you go that's 100
10:29 - unity tips now there are of course a lot
10:31 - more actually I don't think there is I
10:34 - think we covered all of them but I'm
10:36 - sure you guys can think of more so
10:38 - please do share them in the comments and
10:39 - of course don't forget to check out line
10:41 - of code using the link in the
10:42 - description and that thanks for watching
10:44 - and I will see you in the next video
10:46 - let's do outtakes begin

Cleaned transcript:

so while back we did a video on my top ten favorite unity tips well we see the 10 and we ratio by 90 that's right we're kicking off the New Year with 100 cool you needed tips and tricks that hopefully is going to make your life a whole lot easier about 100 bits easier to be exact also a huge thanks to all of you who've been checking out line of code to those of you who don't know we just launched a game dev clothing store and we're just really excited about it so if you haven't checked it out yet head on over to the line of code IO let's of course I think for that in the description all right 100 unity tips here we go so first tip you can change back to the old selection outline by going on the gizmos and turning on selection wire next you can use the pixel perfect camera component to get super crisp pixel art make sure to first install the package in the package manager you can sort sprites based on their yvalue by going to the graphics menu in the project settings and setting the transparency sort mode to custom axis and the Y value to one if you want to destroy a game object but would like to wait a few seconds you can insert a delay as a second parameter if you right click on a shader and create a material it will create a material based on that shader and name it accordingly you can use runtime initialization onload method to execute code in your scripts without having to create an empty game object with a mono behavior copy components while in play mode and paste them back when not playing to save changes to randomly get a variable that is either true or false simply use this short statement consider using structs instead of classes when storing just a few variables because they can live in the stack which eliminates garbage collection right the beginning of the statement in your script and double press tab to generate the rest start a quarantine within another coroutine using this code snippet the animation window can be used to animate pretty much everything the cool thing is that this includes parameters in your own custom scripts you can use control a to select everything in the animation window and then F to frame it all you can use C to toggle curve view and K for keyframe in the animator you can reverse an animation by setting the speed to minus 1 when comparing a distance don't use vector three the distance instead subtract the two points and use square magnitude then square the number you want to compare with this saves a square root call which is really slow use text mesh instead of the fall text objects to get way more control and much crisper text at all sizes mark private variables with serialized field to make them appear in the inspector while still being private if you want to hide a public variable without making it private market with hiding the inspector use the formerly serialized as attribute to rename a field without losing its serialized value you can add folder shortcuts into your unity project to easily be able to open folders that you often use focus on an object by selecting it and pressing F first F twice if you want to follow the object around match the game camera to the scene view by selecting the camera in the hierarchy and pressing control shift F when comparing two tags try to avoid the double equals it's more performant to use the compared tag method you can use empty game object as dividers in your hierarchy to help organize your objects if you want to find all objects with a particular component just search for it in the hierarchy in project search t scene shows only scenes T textures shows only textures and so on pretty cool for quickly finding objects of a certain type use alt + arrow up and down to quickly move lines without having to copy and paste quickly navigate to the documentation for a component by hitting the book in the upper right corner do you need to know when something changed and how then go to the documentation versions to get links to termination for all previous unity versions hold down alt while expanding an object in the hierarchy to expand all child objects as well the same applies to collapsing unity is completely customizable you can move around windows until you're happy then save your settings as a new layout by going to edit preferences color you can adjust editor colors including the background color of the scene view you can also make the editor change color when playing the game by adjusting the play mode tint this is great so you don't forget that the game is running you can choose what effects to show in the
