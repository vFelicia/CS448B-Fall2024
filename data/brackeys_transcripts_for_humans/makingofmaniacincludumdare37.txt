00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to this
00:01 - behind-the-scenes video showing the
00:02 - creation of my entry into the lottery 37
00:05 - combo so those of you who don't know
00:07 - lottery is a game development
00:08 - competition where you get 48 hours to
00:10 - create a game from scratch using only
00:12 - self-made assets some people choose to
00:13 - work in teams they participate in the
00:15 - jam where you get the next two 24 hours
00:17 - however I worked on this game alone so I
00:19 - submitted it to the combo I started
00:21 - working as soon as I woke up the theme
00:23 - had been announced while I was sleeping
00:24 - and so I was excited to find out what I
00:26 - would spend the next two days on the
00:28 - theme was one room
00:29 - I began by sketching out some ideas on
00:31 - the whiteboard my first idea Hey all
00:33 - right
00:34 - my girlfriend's idea was to make a game
00:36 - with the player would fold through a
00:37 - huge pipe and the goal was to avoid
00:39 - obstacles along the way however I
00:41 - thought that the core gameplay was too
00:42 - similar to previous projects of mine
00:44 - also got the idea of creating a
00:46 - programmer simulator where guy would
00:47 - build the programming career sitting on
00:49 - the computer in his bedroom kind of like
00:51 - game dev tycoon this idea had a lot of
00:53 - potential for throwing in some fun jokes
00:54 - and references but I thought it would be
00:56 - too complex to get some actual gameplay
00:58 - going finally I came up with the idea of
01:00 - doing a traditional defender Castle game
01:01 - the main character Bob the maniac is an
01:04 - introvert who is tired of people
01:05 - bothering him all the time so he decides
01:07 - to wipe out the human race all without
01:09 - ever leaving the comfort of this room
01:11 - with this idea in mind it was time to
01:13 - boot up unity I quickly got some enemies
01:15 - walking across the screen I also did a
01:17 - first pass of the shooting mechanic it's
01:18 - not pretty but it worked
01:20 - next up with spawning enemies at first I
01:22 - use the same technique as in my wave
01:23 - spawner tutorial but I found it this way
01:25 - I would have to spend way too much time
01:26 - creating and balancing each individual
01:29 - wave instead I opted to create a pool of
01:31 - enemy types each with a wave start that
01:33 - determines the number of waves before
01:34 - the enemy type starts spawning and with
01:36 - a weight that allow me to make some
01:38 - enemies spawn more frequently than
01:40 - others of course I had to come up with a
01:42 - few algorithms to adjust the amount of
01:44 - enemies and the spawn rate so that the
01:46 - difficulty of each wave would decrease
01:47 - as the player progressed but not doing
01:49 - all this by hand saved a huge amount of
01:51 - time and also made it much easier to
01:53 - adjust difficulty by simply changing
01:55 - some numbers in the algorithm now that
01:57 - the core mechanics were in place it was
01:58 - time to begin working on graphics so I
02:00 - quickly threw together something in
02:02 - Photoshop as the main enemy I created a
02:04 - stick figure and exported every limb as
02:06 - a separate stripe this allowed me to
02:08 - quickly create simple animations inside
02:09 - of unity without having to deal with
02:11 - large sprite sheets Oh
02:13 - and game development is exhausting so
02:15 - remember to eat once in a while at this
02:16 - point it was all about creating more
02:18 - content for the game I programmed the
02:19 - weapon manager that allowed me to swap
02:21 - different weapons in and out at first I
02:23 - made a pistol and Uzi a rifle and a
02:26 - sniper but later I added a bazooka and
02:28 - even a nuke using the same system I made
02:30 - some particle effects to make each hit
02:32 - more impactful and even added in some
02:33 - camera shake for the enemies and made a
02:35 - Humvee the tank and a huge stickman
02:37 - who's a pain to deal with and that was
02:39 - pretty much it for day one for day two I
02:41 - began by redoing the environment a long
02:43 - shower made me realize that some cuter
02:45 - graphics would make the whole thing more
02:46 - enjoyable I also added a custom cursor
02:48 - that would flash red unsuccessful hits
02:50 - it's always a good idea to give the
02:52 - player visual feedback on how he's doing
02:54 - to give the player a sense of
02:55 - progression I added an item shop where
02:57 - you can buy weapons health upgrades and
02:59 - even unlock charts and missile launchers
03:00 - that will automatically kill off
03:02 - incoming enemies as a currency I chose
03:04 - to use insanity because I thought it
03:06 - helped tie the gameplay together with
03:07 - the story and talking about story I
03:09 - needed a good way to display the
03:10 - backstory I'd created for this I made a
03:12 - separate scene that would load before in
03:14 - the main level so avoid just displaying
03:16 - a big chunk of text
03:17 - I made the letters animate in one after
03:19 - the other I think the final result
03:20 - worked pretty well of course make sure
03:22 - to always add a way to skip stuff like
03:23 - this but only a few hours left before
03:25 - the deadline I realized it wouldn't be
03:26 - wise to spend time on a menu so jump
03:29 - right into the audio part I chose to not
03:30 - include music in the game however this
03:32 - was not so much a design decision as it
03:34 - was a way to save some extra time I
03:36 - still had to create a lot of different
03:37 - sounds though I recorded everything
03:39 - through my microphone did a bit of
03:41 - processing and threw it into unity where
03:43 - I created an audio manager to easily
03:45 - play sounds with a bit of variety from
03:47 - different places in my code I always
03:49 - loved adding sound to my game projects
03:50 - because it's the only part one running
03:52 - mindlessly through my apartment banging
03:54 - on everything I can find to see if it
03:55 - sounds cool finally it was time to
03:57 - create the icon at this point I had
03:58 - pretty much exhausted all my creative
04:00 - resources but somehow I managed to throw
04:02 - something together to wrap things up I
04:04 - created a bunch of builds
04:05 - uploaded them to the website along with
04:07 - the description and a few screenshots
04:09 - this is me submitting the game to the
04:11 - site 3 hours after midnight that was
04:13 - pretty much my experience developing
04:14 - maniac Inc I hope you will enjoy playing
04:16 - it there's a link in the description oh
04:18 - and for the next week or so you can vote
04:20 - on games on the Ludum dare website
04:22 - I really recommend just trying out and
04:23 - voting on a bunch of games a lot of them
04:25 - really fun thanks for watching and I
04:27 - will see you in the next video thanks to
04:29 - of the awesome patreon supporters who
04:30 - donated in November and a special thank
