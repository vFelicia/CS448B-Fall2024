00:00 - some man walks into a bar and says have
00:02 - you heard about unities new grid system
00:04 - it's really great especially because the
00:06 - old one was so bad and the bartender
00:08 - goes oh snap so unity recently acquired
00:14 - poly brush and Pro Builder which are two
00:17 - really powerful tools for artists and
00:19 - along the way they also picked up
00:21 - progress procreates is an awesome grid
00:24 - based snapping solution I personally
00:26 - just started using it and I can say that
00:27 - I'm never ever going back
00:29 - pro-gard's makes it extremely easy to
00:31 - quickly sketch out levels place and
00:33 - align objects or just keep your OCD in
00:36 - check so let's have a look at how to use
00:38 - it but first this video is sponsored by
00:40 - Skillshare Skillshare is an online
00:42 - learning community with more than 19
00:44 - thousand quality classes on tech design
00:47 - and more if for example you want to
00:49 - learn how to create a beautiful logo for
00:51 - your game I personally really enjoyed
00:53 - this course on the fundamentals of logo
00:55 - design the tutor Aaron drab Lin is just
00:57 - super fun to learn from Skillshare even
01:00 - has a course specifically on designing a
01:02 - game logo using illustrator a premium
01:05 - Skillshare membership gives you
01:06 - unlimited access to all classes for less
01:08 - than $10 a month so to get started
01:10 - simply click the link in the description
01:12 - and the first 500 people will receive
01:14 - their first two months for only 99 cents
01:17 - alright let's delve right into it to
01:19 - make sure you have Pro Grid installed
01:21 - it's currently hosted on the asset store
01:23 - so we'll go window and select asset
01:25 - store here you can search for
01:27 - appropriate and hit the red button to
01:29 - download and import it will of course
01:31 - have a link for this in the description
01:32 - and right away you should see that in
01:34 - your project window that's a folder
01:36 - called pro core then to enable pro grids
01:39 - and show all the settings we go to tools
01:41 - Pro grids and we open the programs
01:44 - window and right away we can see the
01:46 - visual appearance of our grid changes
01:48 - and we get all these buttons in the
01:50 - upper left hand corner and if I just
01:53 - select my cube here you can see a weird
01:55 - thing happens for some reason the grid
01:58 - changes if I then select the ground the
02:01 - grid changes right back the reason for
02:03 - this is that we currently have a setting
02:05 - enabled that will change the grid for
02:07 - the selected object to disable this
02:09 - we'll go to the left here and click on
02:11 - the lock icon and
02:13 - you can see that we can select any of
02:14 - our objects and the grid will stay the
02:16 - same also make sure to go to the top
02:18 - left and change from Center to pivot if
02:21 - it isn't already and now we can actually
02:24 - start moving our object around the grid
02:27 - and you will see it snaps right in place
02:29 - we can easily change the size of the
02:31 - grid by using this setting at the top in
02:34 - fact we don't even have to touch it we
02:35 - can just use the plus and minus commands
02:38 - in order to change it so this makes it
02:40 - much quicker to adjust how you want your
02:43 - snapping to be if we do click on it
02:45 - however if we get some general snapping
02:47 - settings mainly we can choose whether or
02:49 - not we want to snap when scaling if we
02:51 - enable this and change to our scale tool
02:54 - you can see that our object snaps here
02:56 - as well we can also choose what units to
02:59 - use for our grid most of the time we are
03:01 - going to be using the default meter but
03:03 - really the most important setting here
03:05 - is what is called predictive grid and
03:08 - this is something I noticed right away
03:09 - when I started using it this setting is
03:12 - totally a matter of preference some
03:14 - people love it I really do not let me
03:17 - show you what it does so right now if we
03:20 - move around our cube our grid stays the
03:22 - same because we are kind of viewing it
03:23 - from above but if I go ahead and change
03:26 - my view to kind of a side view you'll
03:28 - see that the great changes as soon as I
03:30 - move the cube and if we go and view it
03:33 - from the other side here and move it we
03:35 - get another grid on this axis and this
03:38 - is what is called the predictive grid we
03:40 - always choose what grid to show manually
03:42 - by selecting either X Y C or a full 3d
03:46 - view if we want to see all of the axes
03:48 - at once but most of the time when I'm
03:51 - building I like to only see the Y grid
03:53 - so I like to go to the top here and
03:56 - simply disable predictive grid and now
03:58 - it doesn't matter where I'm viewing my
04:00 - object from it will always stay the same
04:02 - unless I decide to change it if your
04:05 - grid kind of gets in the way we can
04:07 - always disable it up here now snapping
04:09 - will still be turned on but the grid
04:11 - will be invisible we can just turn it
04:14 - back on but if we wanted to turn off
04:16 - snapping we can do that with the on and
04:18 - off button here turn that often of
04:21 - course now the object is moving smoothly
04:23 - another really useful feature is that we
04:25 - can align objects that
04:27 - on within the grid to the grid by simply
04:29 - pressing a button say if we increase the
04:31 - size of our grid here and move our
04:33 - object kind of outside it and we want to
04:36 - snap it back in place well then we
04:38 - simply use this button right here that
04:39 - snaps all selected objects to the grid
04:41 - and whether the cube snaps right back
04:44 - now I'm gonna decrease the size of our
04:46 - grid again I'm gonna turn snapping back
04:48 - on and I'm gonna move it back up here
04:50 - finally there are actually a bunch of
04:52 - preferences that we can adjust to
04:53 - further configure this tool to that we
04:56 - go to edit preferences and in this
04:58 - window we can go under Pro grates and
05:01 - then we can see we can adjust the color
05:03 - of the different grids as well as the
05:05 - Alpha value here we can also change some
05:07 - of the grid settings as well as change
05:09 - all the different shortcuts if you're
05:11 - unsatisfied with your settings simply
05:12 - hit reset and yes and they will change
05:15 - right back to normal one setting that is
05:17 - pretty important to note is the snap
05:19 - method currently this is set to snap on
05:22 - all axes now what this means is that if
05:25 - we go ahead and select our ground for
05:26 - example which is currently moved
05:28 - underneath our grid and we try and move
05:31 - it over on the X we can see that we can
05:34 - successfully move the ground but it does
05:36 - snap up in place on the Y even though we
05:39 - were only trying to move it on the X
05:41 - this is of course because pro builder
05:43 - tries to keep all the objects aligned
05:45 - with the grid on all axes which in some
05:48 - cases is really great but in this case
05:50 - we want to have our own Y value so if we
05:53 - undo this and change the setting to snap
05:55 - on selected axis and try and do the same
05:58 - you can see that the object now only
05:59 - snaps on the axis that we're currently
06:01 - moving it in and that's pretty much a
06:03 - quick introduction to progress now of
06:06 - course one of the greatest things about
06:07 - this asset is that it works seamlessly
06:09 - with pro builder say we're working with
06:12 - a model inside of pro builder and we
06:14 - want it to snap to the grid well we
06:17 - actually don't need to do any setup we
06:19 - can just go ahead and use it and right
06:21 - away you will see the snapping working
06:23 - this makes it incredibly useful for
06:25 - great boxing and creating levels that
06:28 - are always aligned
06:29 - pretty cool that's pretty much it for
