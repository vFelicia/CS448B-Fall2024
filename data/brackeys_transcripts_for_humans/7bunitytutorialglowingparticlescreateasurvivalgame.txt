00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - and we are back with part two of the
00:07 - seventh episode in our Survival game
00:09 - series done by brais I am the C of brais
00:13 - and now we are going to take a look at
00:16 - creating the particles all right so if
00:19 - you um open up Unity I've already done
00:22 - this um this is the same session uh and
00:25 - you double click on the Imports folder
00:27 - or no I'm sorry back to assets on the
00:30 - the prefabs um what we're going to I am
00:33 - going to be creating is a magical sword
00:37 - so a sword with some kind of um buff on
00:41 - it um some kind of spell on it um you
00:44 - could do this with fire you could do
00:46 - this with ice Buffs you can do it with
00:50 - mystical powers different stuff s
00:53 - swirling around um you can do a a lot of
00:57 - stuff um but um start by dragging it uh
01:01 - dragging it into the scene um so here it
01:04 - is and I've set it up uh correctly and I
01:08 - just need to add some kind of extra
01:11 - graphical element because I think that
01:13 - this by itself is pretty boring um so if
01:17 - you want the uh game to be completely
01:20 - realistic um you you don't need to do
01:23 - this you could make something like a
01:25 - torch with fire on it um you could make
01:29 - uh a flame name thrower you can make
01:31 - everything you want um and if you don't
01:34 - know how to code something you can just
01:36 - write to me uh at YouTube Facebook or
01:39 - Twitter and I'll be answering questions
01:42 - um and maybe even covered in a video
01:45 - okay so um now that we have this sword
01:49 - um let's just position it where it needs
01:52 - to be within the player main camera mely
01:56 - um uh just to be able to see and to view
02:01 - it in the game view also um so we can
02:04 - just track this under our mace or the
02:06 - weapon that you have currently uh put it
02:09 - uh put um
02:11 - selected uh and then just Z out the
02:13 - transform just to get it there um and
02:16 - then drag it out under the m and just
02:20 - click this little button which will
02:23 - disable the Maze and now you can just go
02:26 - ahead and drag it down and rotate it
02:31 - accordingly um this just needs to be
02:36 - like 90 and so now you have a swort that
02:40 - looks all right in the game View and we
02:43 - could go ahead and uh do some stuff with
02:46 - it so um simply go to game object in the
02:50 - top create other and then hit the
02:53 - partical system now we can go ahead and
02:56 - drag this on sword and if we um make the
02:59 - game View a little bit
03:01 - smaller um just so we can still view the
03:04 - sword you can see all kinds of particles
03:08 - racing uh to the top
03:12 - rising and um this does not look like
03:16 - anything we want but um all right so um
03:22 - we need to start tricking some settings
03:25 - so if we uh start by renaming this to
03:30 - we could do sort particles or if you
03:32 - have an idea of what kind of particles
03:35 - you could type sort fire or particles
03:37 - fire whatever you want I'll just do sort
03:40 - particles and over on the right hand
03:43 - side you can now see all the different
03:45 - variables that we are going to tweak oh
03:48 - my God that's a lot um I recommend that
03:52 - you play around with this yourself to
03:54 - get the desired effect um though we are
03:57 - going to take a look at quite a few
03:59 - things okay okay so first of all we want
04:00 - the duration to be yes we could do about
04:03 - five this doesn't really match here
04:04 - because because it's lubing if you want
04:07 - something only to happen in like like
04:09 - instantly or in two seconds one second
04:13 - you can just check um uncheck this
04:16 - looping and it will be just like an
04:18 - explosion so I can show you if I uncheck
04:21 - this and stop and then hit simulate it
04:25 - it simply creates particles for one
04:27 - second and then continue on okay okay so
04:30 - um I'll change this back to five hit the
04:33 - looping and now I'll go down to the um
04:38 - shape and uh I simply want this to only
04:42 - emit from the blade of the sword and now
04:45 - it's emitting on a in a cone uh so this
04:48 - is not what I want I want to change this
04:51 - to
04:53 - box and sorry uh change this to a box
04:57 - and this box is way too huge so I want
05:00 - to just trig these variables
05:04 - down something a little
05:08 - better
05:10 - um watch out by hitting uh with hit
05:13 - hitting F though as I just that um
05:16 - because it will zoom out so you can see
05:19 - every particle um so you might just
05:22 - while you're eding editing this uh hit
05:24 - the stop simulating button um this could
05:28 - be easier for you
05:31 - right so um the width looks all right I
05:35 - might change it down even more to
05:40 - .2 no
05:44 - 0201 I'll go with two it's good to make
05:48 - it a little wider um the
05:51 - Y um okay so um the axes might get
05:55 - screwed up because this is uh local
05:57 - different you can also just go ahead and
06:00 - drag on the particle system itself if
06:02 - you think that typing in the variables
06:05 - is confusing so um if this helps you out
06:09 - you can just go ahead and do that and uh
06:12 - of course position it in the um scene
06:16 - itself to get it
06:19 - right so this looks pretty
06:22 - promising and about that wide again a
06:25 - little wider than you actually than than
06:28 - what the sword this and then drag it
06:31 - down and uh one thing that you should
06:34 - notice now um okay let's just make it a
06:37 - little toiler before I go preaching
06:40 - on
06:42 - um like that this actually fit pretty
06:47 - perfect onto the blade um one thing
06:50 - though this is fine that uh if you want
06:53 - the uh particles to be like stationary
06:55 - so let me show you what I mean by this
06:59 - um so so if I go ahead and just change
07:01 - the size of the particles to
07:04 - 0.1 um this is an all right size and
07:08 - then I go ahead and um change the speed
07:13 - to something really small like
07:17 - 0 um
07:19 - 01 you can see that now the particles
07:22 - are almost stationary and I think that
07:25 - this is pretty boring um but so I want
07:28 - to make make them go up just like fire
07:32 - though when I change the speed to let's
07:35 - say
07:37 - 0.2 this looks pretty natural uh maybe
07:41 - 0.1 then um the particles
07:45 - start um simply collecting here so there
07:49 - are a lot of particles clouding together
07:52 - here and down here we are missing quite
07:54 - a few so what I would simply do even
07:57 - though this seems a little illogical
08:00 - um I would drag this down to make it
08:02 - really small um and then just simply
08:05 - drag the whole system
08:07 - down to just the rout of the
08:11 - weapon and now we can increase the speed
08:14 - and the lifetime as we want it so um I
08:18 - would increase this to about there and
08:21 - now we have a much cooler looking
08:24 - effect um so now now that we have done
08:27 - this um I would go ahead and maybe uh
08:32 - tweak some emission you could go ahead
08:35 - and make it emit more particles or fewer
08:38 - um but I think that 10 is maybe all
08:42 - right um You can also apply gravity so
08:46 - you can make them go up and then down um
08:50 - so you could say that they need to um
08:54 - simply go up at first and then fall down
08:57 - like a waterfall you can do do a lot of
09:00 - different stuff it's um really really a
09:03 - cool tool
09:06 - um to tweak stuff out with um let me
09:10 - just Che what did I screw up here uh so
09:13 - the size the speed needs to be about 2.5
09:19 - 3 4 yes just make five all right so um
09:25 - right now that uh you've probably
09:27 - noticed that when they spawn down here
09:30 - um they don't fade in they just spawn
09:33 - and also they just disappear up here and
09:35 - I think that this effect is um pretty
09:37 - ugly so uh let's change this and we do
09:40 - that by uh checking down here the color
09:43 - by speed so enable this and then you can
09:46 - just uh uncollapse it and then you can
09:50 - hit the uh color function here and now
09:53 - you get what is called the gradient
09:55 - editor and this is basic if You' never
09:57 - seen a gradient Ed to before um this is
10:01 - the beginning of the particle's lifetime
10:04 - and this is the end so it's basically
10:06 - just like a timeline just with color and
10:09 - opacity so um how much what kind of
10:12 - color is it and uh how how well can you
10:15 - see through it so um let's start out by
10:19 - making it all kinds of red um and then
10:25 - uh going to the end and making it more
10:29 - like a orange type
10:31 - feel a little more
10:34 - orange something like
10:38 - this and um it's not changing too
10:44 - much though um so I might go ahead and
10:48 - make this a little less
10:51 - red though it it's changing
10:54 - everything this is pretty weird
10:58 - actually
10:59 - um this should oh this is by speed so uh
11:03 - uncheck the color by speed and then
11:06 - check the color over lifetime now we get
11:08 - the right gradient um so start by making
11:12 - it uh look red and then changing it to
11:18 - Orange something like this this is much
11:20 - better maybe a little wider you
11:25 - can little more
11:27 - right this looks all right I guess um
11:31 - and now you could go ahead and uh click
11:34 - on the little key frames above um and
11:38 - this is the alpha this is the opacity
11:40 - this is how well you can see through so
11:43 - if we just drag this all the way down it
11:45 - will be um simply fading out and uh I
11:48 - guess we want that and if we go ahead
11:51 - and drag the alpha over here so we can
11:54 - determine when it will start to fade out
11:56 - um we could say about already here
12:00 - because then we can make a new one and
12:02 - make it fade in also so drag that Alpha
12:04 - all the way down so now it fades and
12:07 - Fades um we could also make one more
12:11 - here that is um not at all transparent
12:16 - so we have this curve
12:20 - um that we can suddenly start to see how
12:24 - massive the color is and then it fades
12:26 - away but um play around with this uh to
12:30 - get it look looking like you wanted to I
12:33 - think this is pretty cool maybe the red
12:35 - is a little bit too much so we can start
12:38 - changing that um it just
12:41 - makes made a
12:44 - few key frames too
12:46 - much um something like well I guess
12:50 - we'll just leave it at this for now okay
12:54 - so um one thing though right now um the
12:57 - particles don't look look that shiny and
13:00 - um I don't really like the effect of
13:02 - them so what we're going to do is we're
13:04 - going to make a new material and um a
13:08 - material is
13:10 - basically
13:12 - um it's it's what stores a texture and a
13:17 - Shader so um this might not make that
13:21 - much sense but if I go into paint an
13:25 - object has several things that make it
13:29 - uh that that makes it able to be
13:31 - rendered in a
13:33 - scene so um if we have simply a sphere
13:38 - or a box that we want to have rendered
13:41 - in the
13:41 - scene this is our sphere that we want to
13:45 - be
13:47 - rendered in order for this to be
13:49 - rendered it needs quite a few
13:51 - things first of all it needs um to have
13:57 - what it has here this this is simply
13:59 - just an outline this is the mesh this is
14:02 - the model so it need to needs to have a
14:05 - few lines that simply determine um where
14:09 - the computer should draw um
14:14 - surfaces so um it needs this outline
14:18 - this wire
14:20 - frame and uh in a box it would look
14:23 - something like
14:26 - this if you have ever seen a 3D cube
14:30 - before so something like
14:33 - this um so this is just what determines
14:38 - um where it needs to draw faces well
14:40 - that was bad um like this with all the
14:45 - extra um lines so um and once you have
14:50 - that once you have shaped that or have
14:53 - gotten a a program to shape that for you
14:56 - you need um what is called a a
14:59 - material and the materials um store
15:03 - different things so by default a
15:06 - material is just a
15:09 - color it could be black it could be gray
15:12 - it could be white it could be red um so
15:16 - if we have the color
15:18 - red this is the color red in our
15:21 - material um it also needs to store other
15:24 - stuff it stores stuff like a texture and
15:28 - and a
15:30 - Shader and a texture is not just a color
15:34 - this if this uh is if you want more than
15:37 - just one color on a an object this is
15:41 - the detail this could be an image so
15:43 - basically if we wanted to make a wooden
15:46 - plank first of all we would have the
15:49 - lines that make out the
15:54 - plank like
15:56 - this this could create a f
15:59 - fence um so if you had several of these
16:02 - this could create a fence but
16:05 - um first of all you would model it out
16:08 - like this then the computer would start
16:11 - drawing the surfaces using this material
16:15 - so this would make it red if we didn't
16:18 - want it to be completely red though um
16:21 - we could apply a texture which is a
16:24 - image um an image so um this could be a
16:28 - bunch of uh detail this could be um so
16:32 - you have all these lines on it and you
16:34 - have um holes in it um what looks like
16:38 - holes and different colors and um this
16:42 - enables it to be a whole lot more
16:44 - advanced and once you have applied the
16:47 - texture it also needs a Shader and the
16:50 - Shader sounds more complex than it
16:52 - really is the definition of a Shader is
16:55 - how an object interacts with light and
16:58 - and its um environment this is simply
17:02 - how the um object reflects and uh
17:05 - handles lighting so um simply um to to
17:10 - put it simple this could determine
17:12 - whether or not the object is transpar
17:14 - transparent so this of course wouldn't
17:16 - be but a window would have a transparent
17:19 - Shader um some shaders can emit light so
17:22 - if you have a light bulb you want a
17:25 - light emitting
17:27 - Shader something things um is are
17:31 - reflective um what's called a blend is a
17:34 - refle reflective Shader um or um you can
17:38 - have specular on the uh the objects this
17:42 - is a specular Shader um and you can have
17:45 - what's called a Lambert or um in unity
17:49 - um I forget what it's called I think yes
17:52 - a diffuse material uh a diffuse Shader
17:57 - um so this won't create any specular and
17:59 - this is typically what you would use
18:01 - with uh stuff like planks so that's
18:04 - basically um what a material is so this
18:08 - might sound sound complicating uh
18:11 - complicated but it's really not so if we
18:14 - hit don't save and then right click and
18:16 - hit create uh and then open up uh and
18:20 - then material and we could go ahead and
18:23 - just to to simplify this we could call
18:26 - this um maybe wall
18:31 - texture and we could uh over here we
18:34 - choose the Shader so if this needs to be
18:37 - the wall Shader it should probably be
18:40 - diffused because we neither want it to
18:42 - be transparent emitting light or uh nor
18:46 - having uh specular so we could choose a
18:50 - color and maybe we should choose a
18:53 - brownish color and then we could just
18:55 - drag this onto the wall
18:59 - and maybe even select the wall and you
19:01 - can now see that this is the material
19:03 - that it's using but right now this
19:05 - doesn't look that awesome so we could go
19:09 - on to the
19:10 - internet and then just search for um
19:15 - wall texture seamless and this just
19:18 - means that we can um that just a moment
19:24 - I'm just checking that we can tile the
19:26 - texture inside of unity but um you could
19:30 - go ahead and save
19:32 - this and um this is just demonstrative
19:36 - purposes you can go ahead and save this
19:37 - and drag it into Unity as an image file
19:40 - and then just drag it on here as a
19:42 - texture and you can see that now it has
19:44 - texture data applied to it and we can
19:46 - now make the color white to make the
19:48 - texture look nice and we can then
19:50 - determine determine how the texture will
19:54 - tile inside of unity but this is how you
19:57 - do
19:59 - uh this this is how
20:01 - um you handle stuff like this so we
20:05 - would want it to probably look something
20:08 - like this so it's tiled U three times on
20:12 - this axis and only one time on the other
20:15 - we could also do like six here and two
20:18 - here to make it look even better and
20:21 - this is how you apply um detail but
20:23 - we'll be going over this uh later so for
20:26 - now I'll just go ahead and um sorry my
20:29 - phone is ringing um just uh for now
20:32 - we'll just go ahead and make uh
20:36 - this and just delete the um the material
20:40 - and the texture here and you can see
20:43 - that it turns um purple and it just does
20:47 - this when it doesn't have a material
20:49 - applied to it so that we can easily see
20:52 - that it has uh hasn't got
20:54 - one so uh for now we'll we can just um
20:59 - use a default uh Shader or material so
21:02 - add com uh under the mesh renderer
21:05 - materials you can click this to add some
21:07 - one and we can just use the default
21:09 - diffuse all right um so that's that was
21:14 - a uh quick walk through of what a
21:16 - material is right now we need something
21:19 - that looks glowing so right click create
21:21 - and then uh material and then you can
21:24 - call this for additive or glowing and um
21:28 - we can go ahead and change this Shader
21:30 - type to a particle and then additive
21:33 - soft and this will just make it look
21:36 - like it's shining a little bit more um
21:38 - you can play around with this uh if it
21:40 - isn't working for you and then choose
21:42 - the default particles texture and you
21:45 - can see now that it has this fairy kind
21:47 - of look um and we can now go back into
21:50 - the sort particles and then down at the
21:53 - button where it says renderer we can
21:56 - select the material the new material
21:58 - that we've made the additive one and you
22:01 - can see that the um the particles look
22:04 - smaller though but they look better um I
22:09 - think at least uh so we can go ahead and
22:11 - once again increase the size of the
22:14 - particles I'll increase this to 02 and
22:17 - um actually for now I'm pretty satisfied
22:21 - with uh how this sword is looking so we
22:23 - could go ahead and hit play maybe even
22:26 - maximize it and oh um as you can see
22:31 - just when we play it um you can see the
22:33 - particles slowly start emitting if you
22:36 - just want it to be glowing um when you
22:39 - start the game you can uh go to the
22:41 - sword particles and then hit the pre
22:44 - warm so now when you start the game
22:46 - it'll start out uh with the with
22:49 - particles all the way to the top but I
22:51 - think that this is looking pretty cool
22:53 - actually um one thing though if you're
22:55 - creating something like a flamethrower
22:58 - um you would go ahead and check off the
23:00 - the um simulation space you would check
23:03 - this to World instead of local and this
23:06 - means that if you look in the scene view
23:09 - whenever we move the particles doesn't
23:12 - move Withers um this looks silly with
23:16 - stuff like a glowing sword y though so
23:18 - change this back to local so um this is
23:21 - basically it for the uh particles go
23:24 - ahead and hit stop and uh if we select
23:26 - the sword of what a game object you did
23:29 - this on and hit the apply um the sword
23:33 - preset uh prefab now has uh this kind of
23:39 - particle system applied to it so if I
23:40 - drag in a new one you can see that they
23:43 - are both glowing all right so um later
23:46 - on maybe we'll script some kind of buff
23:49 - so it applies more damage or something
23:52 - whenever this is um this is on but uh
23:55 - this was it for now with the uh
23:58 - particles and um I'll see you in the
24:01 - next tutorial thank you for
24:03 - [Music]
24:26 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

and we are back with part two of the seventh episode in our Survival game series done by brais I am the C of brais and now we are going to take a look at creating the particles all right so if you um open up Unity I've already done this um this is the same session uh and you double click on the Imports folder or no I'm sorry back to assets on the the prefabs um what we're going to I am going to be creating is a magical sword so a sword with some kind of um buff on it um some kind of spell on it um you could do this with fire you could do this with ice Buffs you can do it with mystical powers different stuff s swirling around um you can do a a lot of stuff um but um start by dragging it uh dragging it into the scene um so here it is and I've set it up uh correctly and I just need to add some kind of extra graphical element because I think that this by itself is pretty boring um so if you want the uh game to be completely realistic um you you don't need to do this you could make something like a torch with fire on it um you could make uh a flame name thrower you can make everything you want um and if you don't know how to code something you can just write to me uh at YouTube Facebook or Twitter and I'll be answering questions um and maybe even covered in a video okay so um now that we have this sword um let's just position it where it needs to be within the player main camera mely um uh just to be able to see and to view it in the game view also um so we can just track this under our mace or the weapon that you have currently uh put it uh put um selected uh and then just Z out the transform just to get it there um and then drag it out under the m and just click this little button which will disable the Maze and now you can just go ahead and drag it down and rotate it accordingly um this just needs to be like 90 and so now you have a swort that looks all right in the game View and we could go ahead and uh do some stuff with it so um simply go to game object in the top create other and then hit the partical system now we can go ahead and drag this on sword and if we um make the game View a little bit smaller um just so we can still view the sword you can see all kinds of particles racing uh to the top rising and um this does not look like anything we want but um all right so um we need to start tricking some settings so if we uh start by renaming this to we could do sort particles or if you have an idea of what kind of particles you could type sort fire or particles fire whatever you want I'll just do sort particles and over on the right hand side you can now see all the different variables that we are going to tweak oh my God that's a lot um I recommend that you play around with this yourself to get the desired effect um though we are going to take a look at quite a few things okay okay so first of all we want the duration to be yes we could do about five this doesn't really match here because because it's lubing if you want something only to happen in like like instantly or in two seconds one second you can just check um uncheck this looping and it will be just like an explosion so I can show you if I uncheck this and stop and then hit simulate it it simply creates particles for one second and then continue on okay okay so um I'll change this back to five hit the looping and now I'll go down to the um shape and uh I simply want this to only emit from the blade of the sword and now it's emitting on a in a cone uh so this is not what I want I want to change this to box and sorry uh change this to a box and this box is way too huge so I want to just trig these variables down something a little better um watch out by hitting uh with hit hitting F though as I just that um because it will zoom out so you can see every particle um so you might just while you're eding editing this uh hit the stop simulating button um this could be easier for you right so um the width looks all right I might change it down even more to .2 no 0201 I'll go with two it's good to make it a little wider um the Y um okay so um the axes might get screwed up because this is uh local different you can also just go ahead and drag on the particle system itself if you think that typing in the variables is confusing so um if this helps you out you can just go ahead and do that and uh of course position it in the um scene itself to get it right so this looks pretty promising and about that wide again a little wider than you actually than than what the sword this and then drag it down and uh one thing that you should notice now um okay let's just make it a little toiler before I go preaching on um like that this actually fit pretty perfect onto the blade um one thing though this is fine that uh if you want the uh particles to be like stationary so let me show you what I mean by this um so so if I go ahead and just change the size of the particles to 0.1 um this is an all right size and then I go ahead and um change the speed to something really small like 0 um 01 you can see that now the particles are almost stationary and I think that this is pretty boring um but so I want to make make them go up just like fire though when I change the speed to let's say 0.2 this looks pretty natural uh maybe 0.1 then um the particles start um simply collecting here so there are a lot of particles clouding together here and down here we are missing quite a few so what I would simply do even though this seems a little illogical um I would drag this down to make it really small um and then just simply drag the whole system down to just the rout of the weapon and now we can increase the speed and the lifetime as we want it so um I would increase this to about there and now we have a much cooler looking effect um so now now that we have done this um I would go ahead and maybe uh tweak some emission you could go ahead and make it emit more particles or fewer um but I think that 10 is maybe all right um You can also apply gravity so you can make them go up and then down um so you could say that they need to um simply go up at first and then fall down like a waterfall you can do do a lot of different stuff it's um really really a cool tool um to tweak stuff out with um let me just Che what did I screw up here uh so the size the speed needs to be about 2.5 3 4 yes just make five all right so um right now that uh you've probably noticed that when they spawn down here um they don't fade in they just spawn and also they just disappear up here and I think that this effect is um pretty ugly so uh let's change this and we do that by uh checking down here the color by speed so enable this and then you can just uh uncollapse it and then you can hit the uh color function here and now you get what is called the gradient editor and this is basic if You' never seen a gradient Ed to before um this is the beginning of the particle's lifetime and this is the end so it's basically just like a timeline just with color and opacity so um how much what kind of color is it and uh how how well can you see through it so um let's start out by making it all kinds of red um and then uh going to the end and making it more like a orange type feel a little more orange something like this and um it's not changing too much though um so I might go ahead and make this a little less red though it it's changing everything this is pretty weird actually um this should oh this is by speed so uh uncheck the color by speed and then check the color over lifetime now we get the right gradient um so start by making it uh look red and then changing it to Orange something like this this is much better maybe a little wider you can little more right this looks all right I guess um and now you could go ahead and uh click on the little key frames above um and this is the alpha this is the opacity this is how well you can see through so if we just drag this all the way down it will be um simply fading out and uh I guess we want that and if we go ahead and drag the alpha over here so we can determine when it will start to fade out um we could say about already here because then we can make a new one and make it fade in also so drag that Alpha all the way down so now it fades and Fades um we could also make one more here that is um not at all transparent so we have this curve um that we can suddenly start to see how massive the color is and then it fades away but um play around with this uh to get it look looking like you wanted to I think this is pretty cool maybe the red is a little bit too much so we can start changing that um it just makes made a few key frames too much um something like well I guess we'll just leave it at this for now okay so um one thing though right now um the particles don't look look that shiny and um I don't really like the effect of them so what we're going to do is we're going to make a new material and um a material is basically um it's it's what stores a texture and a Shader so um this might not make that much sense but if I go into paint an object has several things that make it uh that that makes it able to be rendered in a scene so um if we have simply a sphere or a box that we want to have rendered in the scene this is our sphere that we want to be rendered in order for this to be rendered it needs quite a few things first of all it needs um to have what it has here this this is simply just an outline this is the mesh this is the model so it need to needs to have a few lines that simply determine um where the computer should draw um surfaces so um it needs this outline this wire frame and uh in a box it would look something like this if you have ever seen a 3D cube before so something like this um so this is just what determines um where it needs to draw faces well that was bad um like this with all the extra um lines so um and once you have that once you have shaped that or have gotten a a program to shape that for you you need um what is called a a material and the materials um store different things so by default a material is just a color it could be black it could be gray it could be white it could be red um so if we have the color red this is the color red in our material um it also needs to store other stuff it stores stuff like a texture and and a Shader and a texture is not just a color this if this uh is if you want more than just one color on a an object this is the detail this could be an image so basically if we wanted to make a wooden plank first of all we would have the lines that make out the plank like this this could create a f fence um so if you had several of these this could create a fence but um first of all you would model it out like this then the computer would start drawing the surfaces using this material so this would make it red if we didn't want it to be completely red though um we could apply a texture which is a image um an image so um this could be a bunch of uh detail this could be um so you have all these lines on it and you have um holes in it um what looks like holes and different colors and um this enables it to be a whole lot more advanced and once you have applied the texture it also needs a Shader and the Shader sounds more complex than it really is the definition of a Shader is how an object interacts with light and and its um environment this is simply how the um object reflects and uh handles lighting so um simply um to to put it simple this could determine whether or not the object is transpar transparent so this of course wouldn't be but a window would have a transparent Shader um some shaders can emit light so if you have a light bulb you want a light emitting Shader something things um is are reflective um what's called a blend is a refle reflective Shader um or um you can have specular on the uh the objects this is a specular Shader um and you can have what's called a Lambert or um in unity um I forget what it's called I think yes a diffuse material uh a diffuse Shader um so this won't create any specular and this is typically what you would use with uh stuff like planks so that's basically um what a material is so this might sound sound complicating uh complicated but it's really not so if we hit don't save and then right click and hit create uh and then open up uh and then material and we could go ahead and just to to simplify this we could call this um maybe wall texture and we could uh over here we choose the Shader so if this needs to be the wall Shader it should probably be diffused because we neither want it to be transparent emitting light or uh nor having uh specular so we could choose a color and maybe we should choose a brownish color and then we could just drag this onto the wall and maybe even select the wall and you can now see that this is the material that it's using but right now this doesn't look that awesome so we could go on to the internet and then just search for um wall texture seamless and this just means that we can um that just a moment I'm just checking that we can tile the texture inside of unity but um you could go ahead and save this and um this is just demonstrative purposes you can go ahead and save this and drag it into Unity as an image file and then just drag it on here as a texture and you can see that now it has texture data applied to it and we can now make the color white to make the texture look nice and we can then determine determine how the texture will tile inside of unity but this is how you do uh this this is how um you handle stuff like this so we would want it to probably look something like this so it's tiled U three times on this axis and only one time on the other we could also do like six here and two here to make it look even better and this is how you apply um detail but we'll be going over this uh later so for now I'll just go ahead and um sorry my phone is ringing um just uh for now we'll just go ahead and make uh this and just delete the um the material and the texture here and you can see that it turns um purple and it just does this when it doesn't have a material applied to it so that we can easily see that it has uh hasn't got one so uh for now we'll we can just um use a default uh Shader or material so add com uh under the mesh renderer materials you can click this to add some one and we can just use the default diffuse all right um so that's that was a uh quick walk through of what a material is right now we need something that looks glowing so right click create and then uh material and then you can call this for additive or glowing and um we can go ahead and change this Shader type to a particle and then additive soft and this will just make it look like it's shining a little bit more um you can play around with this uh if it isn't working for you and then choose the default particles texture and you can see now that it has this fairy kind of look um and we can now go back into the sort particles and then down at the button where it says renderer we can select the material the new material that we've made the additive one and you can see that the um the particles look smaller though but they look better um I think at least uh so we can go ahead and once again increase the size of the particles I'll increase this to 02 and um actually for now I'm pretty satisfied with uh how this sword is looking so we could go ahead and hit play maybe even maximize it and oh um as you can see just when we play it um you can see the particles slowly start emitting if you just want it to be glowing um when you start the game you can uh go to the sword particles and then hit the pre warm so now when you start the game it'll start out uh with the with particles all the way to the top but I think that this is looking pretty cool actually um one thing though if you're creating something like a flamethrower um you would go ahead and check off the the um simulation space you would check this to World instead of local and this means that if you look in the scene view whenever we move the particles doesn't move Withers um this looks silly with stuff like a glowing sword y though so change this back to local so um this is basically it for the uh particles go ahead and hit stop and uh if we select the sword of what a game object you did this on and hit the apply um the sword preset uh prefab now has uh this kind of particle system applied to it so if I drag in a new one you can see that they are both glowing all right so um later on maybe we'll script some kind of buff so it applies more damage or something whenever this is um this is on but uh this was it for now with the uh particles and um I'll see you in the next tutorial thank you for watching he
