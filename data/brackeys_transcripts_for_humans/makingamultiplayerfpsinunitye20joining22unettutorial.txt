With timestamps:

00:00 - so this is the second part on creating
00:01 - our own custom server browser immunity
00:03 - if you haven't seen the first one I
00:05 - suggest you go ahead and do that now by
00:07 - clicking on the screen so what we can
00:09 - then do is we can go ahead and say room
00:10 - list dot add and now we simply want to
00:15 - add our room list item geo so we'll now
00:19 - we have now added it to the list and we
00:22 - will now keep track of it as we go so I
00:26 - believe that's all we need to do for now
00:28 - and if we hit play here of course it's
00:31 - going to say it's not going to do
00:34 - anything because well basically wait
00:36 - wait this is not pretty so what do we
00:39 - have okay so we of course need to set up
00:41 - some of these references here so we'll
00:43 - take our status text and drag it under
00:45 - the status we'll take a room list item
00:48 - prefab and drag that under there and
00:50 - we'll have a room list parent which is
00:53 - going to be our content there we go
00:56 - oh I set all of those up in plane mode
00:58 - so room list item prefab status text and
01:01 - room list parent there we go so now
01:04 - let's hit play and we shouldn't get any
01:06 - errors but we aren't getting any arm
01:10 - getting any servers either because there
01:13 - aren't currently any active and we could
01:15 - of course go ahead and make a case for
01:17 - this in here simply say if maybe we
01:22 - should say down here that if room list
01:26 - dot our count is equal to zero well then
01:31 - we can set status dot text equal to no
01:35 - rooms at the moment and now when we hit
01:42 - play we should see that it goes through
01:44 - all of these steps and it finds all of
01:46 - the matches but it finds out that there
01:50 - are no rooms available at the moment and
01:52 - you can see here that we just need to
01:54 - expand this to make room for the text so
01:57 - if we play here again it says no rooms
01:59 - at the moment so that's fine
02:01 - and we can go ahead and hit refresh and
02:03 - and nothing will happen so that's the
02:05 - next part that is we need to load up
02:07 - this UI here so I'm just going to find
02:11 - our refresh button
02:13 - and undo unclick we can drag in our join
02:16 - our game object up here going to
02:18 - function join game and then find the
02:21 - refresh room list and now when we play
02:24 - you should see it add and searches for
02:28 - rooms and when we hit refresh it does so
02:30 - again and it very quickly says loading
02:33 - up here so that's it so we have feedback
02:36 - on what is currently happening so let's
02:38 - go ahead and test this out by creating a
02:40 - separate client so I'm going to hit ctrl
02:42 - B or command B if you're on a Mac to
02:45 - quickly build a player here and I'm
02:48 - going to just have this sit in a room
02:51 - with a name that we create here so this
02:54 - is our client I'm just going to resize
02:57 - this I'm going to have this sit on my
03:02 - secondary monitor in some kind of game
03:04 - and this is just going to be our awesome
03:07 - game so let's create a room here and I'm
03:10 - going to just drag this over here all
03:12 - it's going to do is sit here in our
03:14 - level and then now when we hit play here
03:18 - you could say see here that it doesn't
03:21 - change the name on the amount of players
03:23 - but it actually pops up and it does so
03:25 - no matter how many time times I refresh
03:29 - so that's super cool and you can also
03:31 - see that our loading object there is to
03:34 - looking kind of fun kind of funky and
03:37 - maybe what we should do is actually go
03:40 - ahead and clear the room list when we
03:43 - are before we refresh here so if we just
03:45 - clear the room list right here I think
03:49 - that will make a bit more sense and I
03:52 - still have the other client working here
03:54 - generally you shouldn't have clients on
03:56 - different versions connect to each other
03:58 - but in this case it's fine so you can
04:00 - see there that it says loading and then
04:02 - it finds the new list so that's much
04:04 - better so cool now that we have this set
04:07 - up we of course again want a way for us
04:10 - to actually join the game and then wait
04:12 - for it to update this text so you can
04:14 - see right now when I click this nothing
04:16 - happens so to do this let's go to a room
04:18 - list item and add a new component and
04:21 - we'll call this one indeed room list
04:24 - item there's no way to further come
04:26 - okay thanks you so let's double click
04:27 - click that to open it up in monodevelop
04:30 - and we need a few things in here we're
04:33 - not going to be using system that
04:34 - collections however so we can remove
04:37 - some of the functions here and the first
04:40 - thing that I want is a way for us from
04:43 - our joint game here to pass in the match
04:46 - that we are currently ahh
04:49 - that this room list item is associated
04:51 - to so that it can set up the name and
04:54 - the amount of players so therefore we
04:57 - need a variable in here that is going to
04:59 - be a private and this is going to be a
05:01 - match description so therefore we need
05:03 - to be using unity engine done networking
05:07 - dot match so a match description and
05:11 - this is just going to be our match you
05:14 - can call this match info whatever you
05:16 - want to and with then we are going to
05:18 - have a public void and this is going to
05:20 - be a set up method and what we want here
05:23 - is to take in as a parameter the match
05:26 - that we have found on your giant game so
05:30 - this is going to be another match
05:32 - description and this is going to be our
05:34 - underscore match and then we can set
05:36 - match equal to underscore match and we
05:39 - can then change the text on this object
05:43 - using match dot and match dot user or
05:49 - its current size and max size that's
05:52 - what it is so if we just save that and
05:55 - hit back into unity we can now maybe
05:58 - actually we need a reference here so we
06:00 - need to make a civilized field and this
06:03 - is going to be a private text and
06:06 - because we're using a text we need to
06:08 - use unity engine dot UI and this is
06:13 - going to be a private text and this is
06:15 - going to be our room list item text we
06:25 - could also just call this the room name
06:26 - text I think that's better so a room
06:29 - name text and what we can do down here
06:32 - is simply set room name dot text room
06:35 - name text dot txt equal to man
06:40 - dot name and then + and I'm just going
06:43 - to have a sip of water here because this
06:47 - tutorial is crazy long so match the name
06:51 - + and then we'll have a parenthesis plus
06:55 - and then match dot current size plus and
07:01 - then a slash or - or whatever slash I
07:05 - think + match dot back size and then +
07:11 - and in in parentheses and I believe that
07:16 - is all we need to do so it's written out
07:18 - like this so this is going to display a
07:20 - match name and then the current amount
07:22 - of players out of how many players there
07:25 - is room for so that's fine that all
07:27 - looks great and we can now try this out
07:30 - as long as of course we remember to call
07:33 - this from our joint game method so have
07:35 - a component sit on the game object that
07:37 - is now done and we can get a reference
07:39 - to this very easily recently do a room
07:44 - list item and we call this on a score
07:47 - room list item and that's what why I
07:49 - wanted to prefix or um put geo at the
07:55 - end of this name and we can now set this
07:57 - equal to K get component room list item
08:01 - there we go and just for you know good
08:06 - practice sake we should error check to
08:08 - see if this is actually there so if room
08:11 - list item is not equal to null excuse me
08:17 - well in that case we want to go room
08:19 - list item dot setup and we want to pass
08:23 - in the match and the match in this cage
08:25 - in this case is match from up here so we
08:29 - just pass in the match there and
08:31 - everything should be good then all we
08:33 - need to do on the room list item is find
08:36 - our text object and drag it in there so
08:42 - let's hit play and you should see it
08:45 - says rule name which is not the name of
08:49 - our room so what is going on here
08:53 - so we are calling the set up and we are
08:59 - setting the text equal to match name
09:02 - here so that should actually be working
09:05 - but for some reason this isn't updating
09:08 - so let me just check we have the room
09:10 - list item here it probably means that
09:13 - the setup method is never called but it
09:18 - should be called so let's just try and
09:21 - see if this setup method is actually
09:23 - cold so let's try and debug that like
09:26 - this and say test let me just check here
09:31 - it says if room list item is not equal
09:34 - to null
09:35 - oh we're using getcomponent here we of
09:37 - course need to use room list item geo
09:43 - dot get component there we go so we can
09:46 - remove this debug block statement and
09:49 - now we are calling it so we want to
09:51 - search for this under the object and not
09:54 - the join game object that this is
09:56 - sitting on so now we should see this
09:58 - working so if we hit play here we can
10:01 - see that it creates a button here and
10:04 - it's called awesome game and that's
10:05 - currently one out of six players man I
10:08 - want to join this but we can't so how do
10:11 - we set up the ability for us to join
10:12 - this game well basically what we can
10:15 - have is a and a function on the room
10:17 - list item that is called by our button
10:21 - here by our on click event and we can
10:24 - just link those up so let's go into our
10:26 - room this item let's have a public void
10:28 - here called join game it's that symbol
10:32 - and what we want to do here is another
10:35 - thing but what we can do is then go on
10:37 - to our our room list item our prefab
10:41 - excuse me again and add a new one click
10:45 - event and drag our room list item into
10:48 - that Grundy function and room list item
10:51 - and select the one called joint game so
10:53 - that is now being called however we now
10:56 - want our joint game to link to what
10:59 - every game that we now want to join so
11:03 - we want that to call a function over
11:05 - here under the joint
11:07 - game script that is that is then aware
11:13 - of what match to join and the way we do
11:18 - this is again we can do then because now
11:21 - we've done that is by setting up a
11:23 - callback function so how do we do this
11:25 - well in a room list item we want to now
11:28 - create a delicate so if I go up here and
11:32 - create a public delicate and this is
11:36 - going to be a void and it very much
11:39 - looks like a function because that's
11:41 - pretty much what it is it's a pointer to
11:43 - a lot of different functions so a public
11:45 - delegate void and in here I'm going to
11:49 - call this the R join and instead of
11:53 - calling this joint game I really think
11:55 - we should call this join room just so
11:57 - we're consistent with our our naming and
11:59 - we should remember to set that up in a
12:01 - in a moment so this is going to be a
12:03 - join room delicate and this is going to
12:08 - take in as an argument a match
12:10 - description called match and we can
12:16 - close that off so this is what our
12:18 - function should look like this is what
12:20 - the function that we want to call should
12:23 - look like then we can create an instance
12:25 - of the this delicate so our public
12:28 - delicate void can now be turned into a
12:30 - public join room delegate which we are
12:33 - going to call will join room delicate
12:37 - like that great okay so we are here this
12:40 - fine actually I think we can go ahead
12:42 - and make this private which would be
12:44 - great and then here in our setup we can
12:46 - pass in a function now that we want to
12:49 - associate to our join room delicate and
12:52 - that function will then be called uh
12:55 - when every this joint room is cold so if
12:58 - that sounds confusing I really
13:00 - understand why let me just type this out
13:02 - and I can explain further so let's go
13:05 - ahead and do this so let's call this a
13:08 - join room delegate and this is going to
13:11 - be cold underscore join room delegate or
13:15 - maybe join room Colback or something
13:18 - like that we don't need to name it Delek
13:20 - it actually let's just call this the
13:22 - join room call Bacchus world and we can
13:27 - go down here and then set join room call
13:31 - back equal to underscore join room call
13:34 - back like that and then under your join
13:37 - room we can say join room call back dot
13:40 - invoke and we can pass in our match from
13:44 - up here okay so what the heck is going
13:47 - on here
13:48 - well basically what we're saying is that
13:51 - we want to be able to make a delicate
13:54 - that will contain a bunch of references
13:58 - to a set of functions that we want to
14:02 - call however we don't necessarily know
14:04 - what these functions are at the moment
14:07 - we only know that at runtime at some
14:09 - point in the future so what we do is we
14:11 - create this delicate which is bathed
14:13 - basically a callback that means that
14:16 - functions are able to subscribe to this
14:18 - callback so that when we invoke it all
14:21 - of the functions subscribe to it will be
14:24 - called in our case we only want one
14:26 - function to subscribe to this so we're
14:29 - creating a delegate void and then we're
14:31 - creating an instance of that and that is
14:33 - such join room callback then down here
14:37 - we are adding the possibility for us to
14:40 - when we're setting up put in a function
14:42 - that we will set our join back a join
14:45 - room callback equal to that means that
14:48 - went down here we we invoke our join
14:52 - room callback whatever function we
14:54 - passed in up here is going to be called
14:56 - so that's basically it so it just allows
14:59 - us to input a function as an argument
15:01 - and call that function down here no
15:04 - matter what that function is or what it
15:06 - does cool so now we can go into our and
15:11 - we are going to get an error here but we
15:14 - could still be able to go into a room
15:16 - list item here nope we're not so what's
15:21 - going on here
15:22 - clear that no overload method takes one
15:25 - okay so it's in here rule missed item
15:27 - set of match and now we can input both
15:30 - our match and the join room call back
15:32 - whatever function we want to be
15:33 - out here and in our case and that is a
15:36 - new function that we want to make cold
15:39 - and this should be public I believe
15:41 - public void join room and this join room
15:47 - of course takes in a match description
15:50 - and we'll call that match great and down
15:54 - here we want some functionality for this
15:56 - but I'm just going to say debug deadlock
15:59 - joining and then we are going to do the
16:02 - underscore match dot okay cool and now
16:09 - in here we can simply say join game
16:12 - there we go
16:14 - join room general john room there we go
16:17 - okay
16:17 - and that's all we need to do there then
16:21 - in here what we can do is wait for this
16:24 - to refresh and then we need to just
16:28 - change this rule room besides him to
16:31 - join room instead of join game it's
16:33 - disappear now so that's great and hit
16:36 - play and now this here it's it looks
16:41 - like nothing has changed but basically
16:43 - this button has now linked itself to a
16:47 - method on a joint game that will make
16:50 - sure that it joins the game that we've
16:53 - clicked on so that's super cool so we
16:56 - can when we click this now we should
16:57 - actually be joining the game and that
17:03 - did not work there we go so joining
17:05 - awesome game there you can see so the
17:07 - first time was because I hadn't selected
17:09 - the window so first it selected it and
17:11 - then it took the button press so and you
17:15 - can see I can keep on doing this so and
17:16 - then that now works and that super great
17:19 - so joining awesome game and what we can
17:23 - then do is instead of just having it say
17:26 - this we should actually go ahead and
17:29 - make it do this and it's really really
17:32 - simple so this is actually the most
17:34 - simple step at all so we're going to go
17:37 - under our network manager and we're
17:40 - going to call something under our
17:42 - matchmaker cold joined match
17:47 - this of course takes in again a bunch of
17:49 - arguments and let's just see them here
17:51 - so first it takes in a unknit ID we get
17:55 - this by calling match dot it work ID
17:58 - then it takes in a password in our case
18:01 - that is just nothing and then it takes
18:04 - in a callback in our case that we'll
18:06 - just use the one on your network manager
18:08 - and this is the one called on join match
18:11 - on match joint there we go and then
18:13 - let's close that off then we'll also
18:16 - clear our room list and we will set our
18:19 - status text equal to joining dot dot all
18:26 - right
18:27 - so that's basically it so let's clear
18:29 - this out let's hit play and now we
18:32 - should be able to join the game and you
18:34 - can see here that the other client is
18:36 - still running the game and I can now go
18:39 - and hit and hit click to join so did
18:42 - that again there so let's it click to
18:44 - join here and aah that's annoying so
18:47 - we'll have a look at fixing that in just
18:49 - a moment so it I actually was able to
18:52 - join here and you can see that I'm now
18:54 - in the game so that's perfect that's
18:56 - working and if we go and hit play you
19:00 - can see it says still says two out of
19:02 - six but that's because I didn't
19:04 - disconnect probably properly I simply
19:07 - just hit the stop playing button here
19:09 - we'll have a look at this disconnecting
19:12 - in a proper way later so don't worry
19:15 - about that for now that will change at
19:18 - some point but you can see we can hit
19:20 - refresh here and that does work so
19:22 - that's perfect and then all I wanted to
19:25 - do is simply fix this problem of not
19:28 - hitting the button right so if we find a
19:31 - room list item here we can just drag it
19:34 - under our under join game scroll view
19:40 - viewport content there we go so what is
19:43 - the issue here we should be able to hit
19:47 - that it's probably our status text is
19:53 - above this and what I think what's
19:55 - happening is that we hit the status text
19:58 - box here maybe maybe
20:01 - so what we can do is simply drag this
20:03 - above the viewport and I actually think
20:06 - that might have salted it could also be
20:09 - that we are we're hitting this click to
20:11 - join but I think that would still work
20:14 - but I'm not a hundred percent on that so
20:16 - let's try and hit apply on this and just
20:19 - see if it's fixed already if it was that
20:21 - easy that would be awesome so that's
20:22 - yeah and now it works so that was
20:25 - basically all that we needed to do in
20:27 - order to fix that and you can see that
20:29 - we now have a working server browser
20:31 - that will display the amount of games
20:33 - and all that I'm just going to show you
20:35 - here that if I hit play and then I'll
20:38 - terminate my other client here actually
20:40 - this might not work because again I'm
20:43 - terminating this so if I hit play here
20:45 - and then yeah now it's just three out of
20:48 - six so that just made it a lot weirder
20:50 - so that's because we need to disconnect
20:52 - probably we'll do that in a separate
20:54 - video I want to create one for our
20:55 - passing the game and then properly
20:58 - disconnecting so that was it for this
21:00 - video I hope that you enjoyed it I know
21:02 - it was quite crazy all of this with
21:04 - delicates and UI things and networking
21:07 - and it is confusing
21:09 - it really is network games can be pain
21:13 - to work with sometimes but when it works
21:15 - it's just so rewarding and basically
21:17 - we're at a stage now where you can send
21:19 - this to all of your friends and actually
21:21 - have them create some rooms and jumping
21:23 - there and enjoy the game with them so I
21:25 - think that's really exciting so without
21:27 - further ado thanks for watching and I'll
21:29 - see you in the next video thank you so
21:31 - much to all of the awesome patreon
21:33 - supporters who donated in July and a
21:35 - special thanks to vixen famous own and
21:37 - UK and Locke's game TV these videos
21:40 - wouldn't be possible without you

Cleaned transcript:

so this is the second part on creating our own custom server browser immunity if you haven't seen the first one I suggest you go ahead and do that now by clicking on the screen so what we can then do is we can go ahead and say room list dot add and now we simply want to add our room list item geo so we'll now we have now added it to the list and we will now keep track of it as we go so I believe that's all we need to do for now and if we hit play here of course it's going to say it's not going to do anything because well basically wait wait this is not pretty so what do we have okay so we of course need to set up some of these references here so we'll take our status text and drag it under the status we'll take a room list item prefab and drag that under there and we'll have a room list parent which is going to be our content there we go oh I set all of those up in plane mode so room list item prefab status text and room list parent there we go so now let's hit play and we shouldn't get any errors but we aren't getting any arm getting any servers either because there aren't currently any active and we could of course go ahead and make a case for this in here simply say if maybe we should say down here that if room list dot our count is equal to zero well then we can set status dot text equal to no rooms at the moment and now when we hit play we should see that it goes through all of these steps and it finds all of the matches but it finds out that there are no rooms available at the moment and you can see here that we just need to expand this to make room for the text so if we play here again it says no rooms at the moment so that's fine and we can go ahead and hit refresh and and nothing will happen so that's the next part that is we need to load up this UI here so I'm just going to find our refresh button and undo unclick we can drag in our join our game object up here going to function join game and then find the refresh room list and now when we play you should see it add and searches for rooms and when we hit refresh it does so again and it very quickly says loading up here so that's it so we have feedback on what is currently happening so let's go ahead and test this out by creating a separate client so I'm going to hit ctrl B or command B if you're on a Mac to quickly build a player here and I'm going to just have this sit in a room with a name that we create here so this is our client I'm just going to resize this I'm going to have this sit on my secondary monitor in some kind of game and this is just going to be our awesome game so let's create a room here and I'm going to just drag this over here all it's going to do is sit here in our level and then now when we hit play here you could say see here that it doesn't change the name on the amount of players but it actually pops up and it does so no matter how many time times I refresh so that's super cool and you can also see that our loading object there is to looking kind of fun kind of funky and maybe what we should do is actually go ahead and clear the room list when we are before we refresh here so if we just clear the room list right here I think that will make a bit more sense and I still have the other client working here generally you shouldn't have clients on different versions connect to each other but in this case it's fine so you can see there that it says loading and then it finds the new list so that's much better so cool now that we have this set up we of course again want a way for us to actually join the game and then wait for it to update this text so you can see right now when I click this nothing happens so to do this let's go to a room list item and add a new component and we'll call this one indeed room list item there's no way to further come okay thanks you so let's double click click that to open it up in monodevelop and we need a few things in here we're not going to be using system that collections however so we can remove some of the functions here and the first thing that I want is a way for us from our joint game here to pass in the match that we are currently ahh that this room list item is associated to so that it can set up the name and the amount of players so therefore we need a variable in here that is going to be a private and this is going to be a match description so therefore we need to be using unity engine done networking dot match so a match description and this is just going to be our match you can call this match info whatever you want to and with then we are going to have a public void and this is going to be a set up method and what we want here is to take in as a parameter the match that we have found on your giant game so this is going to be another match description and this is going to be our underscore match and then we can set match equal to underscore match and we can then change the text on this object using match dot and match dot user or its current size and max size that's what it is so if we just save that and hit back into unity we can now maybe actually we need a reference here so we need to make a civilized field and this is going to be a private text and because we're using a text we need to use unity engine dot UI and this is going to be a private text and this is going to be our room list item text we could also just call this the room name text I think that's better so a room name text and what we can do down here is simply set room name dot text room name text dot txt equal to man dot name and then + and I'm just going to have a sip of water here because this tutorial is crazy long so match the name + and then we'll have a parenthesis plus and then match dot current size plus and then a slash or or whatever slash I think + match dot back size and then + and in in parentheses and I believe that is all we need to do so it's written out like this so this is going to display a match name and then the current amount of players out of how many players there is room for so that's fine that all looks great and we can now try this out as long as of course we remember to call this from our joint game method so have a component sit on the game object that is now done and we can get a reference to this very easily recently do a room list item and we call this on a score room list item and that's what why I wanted to prefix or um put geo at the end of this name and we can now set this equal to K get component room list item there we go and just for you know good practice sake we should error check to see if this is actually there so if room list item is not equal to null excuse me well in that case we want to go room list item dot setup and we want to pass in the match and the match in this cage in this case is match from up here so we just pass in the match there and everything should be good then all we need to do on the room list item is find our text object and drag it in there so let's hit play and you should see it says rule name which is not the name of our room so what is going on here so we are calling the set up and we are setting the text equal to match name here so that should actually be working but for some reason this isn't updating so let me just check we have the room list item here it probably means that the setup method is never called but it should be called so let's just try and see if this setup method is actually cold so let's try and debug that like this and say test let me just check here it says if room list item is not equal to null oh we're using getcomponent here we of course need to use room list item geo dot get component there we go so we can remove this debug block statement and now we are calling it so we want to search for this under the object and not the join game object that this is sitting on so now we should see this working so if we hit play here we can see that it creates a button here and it's called awesome game and that's currently one out of six players man I want to join this but we can't so how do we set up the ability for us to join this game well basically what we can have is a and a function on the room list item that is called by our button here by our on click event and we can just link those up so let's go into our room this item let's have a public void here called join game it's that symbol and what we want to do here is another thing but what we can do is then go on to our our room list item our prefab excuse me again and add a new one click event and drag our room list item into that Grundy function and room list item and select the one called joint game so that is now being called however we now want our joint game to link to what every game that we now want to join so we want that to call a function over here under the joint game script that is that is then aware of what match to join and the way we do this is again we can do then because now we've done that is by setting up a callback function so how do we do this well in a room list item we want to now create a delicate so if I go up here and create a public delicate and this is going to be a void and it very much looks like a function because that's pretty much what it is it's a pointer to a lot of different functions so a public delegate void and in here I'm going to call this the R join and instead of calling this joint game I really think we should call this join room just so we're consistent with our our naming and we should remember to set that up in a in a moment so this is going to be a join room delicate and this is going to take in as an argument a match description called match and we can close that off so this is what our function should look like this is what the function that we want to call should look like then we can create an instance of the this delicate so our public delicate void can now be turned into a public join room delegate which we are going to call will join room delicate like that great okay so we are here this fine actually I think we can go ahead and make this private which would be great and then here in our setup we can pass in a function now that we want to associate to our join room delicate and that function will then be called uh when every this joint room is cold so if that sounds confusing I really understand why let me just type this out and I can explain further so let's go ahead and do this so let's call this a join room delegate and this is going to be cold underscore join room delegate or maybe join room Colback or something like that we don't need to name it Delek it actually let's just call this the join room call Bacchus world and we can go down here and then set join room call back equal to underscore join room call back like that and then under your join room we can say join room call back dot invoke and we can pass in our match from up here okay so what the heck is going on here well basically what we're saying is that we want to be able to make a delicate that will contain a bunch of references to a set of functions that we want to call however we don't necessarily know what these functions are at the moment we only know that at runtime at some point in the future so what we do is we create this delicate which is bathed basically a callback that means that functions are able to subscribe to this callback so that when we invoke it all of the functions subscribe to it will be called in our case we only want one function to subscribe to this so we're creating a delegate void and then we're creating an instance of that and that is such join room callback then down here we are adding the possibility for us to when we're setting up put in a function that we will set our join back a join room callback equal to that means that went down here we we invoke our join room callback whatever function we passed in up here is going to be called so that's basically it so it just allows us to input a function as an argument and call that function down here no matter what that function is or what it does cool so now we can go into our and we are going to get an error here but we could still be able to go into a room list item here nope we're not so what's going on here clear that no overload method takes one okay so it's in here rule missed item set of match and now we can input both our match and the join room call back whatever function we want to be out here and in our case and that is a new function that we want to make cold and this should be public I believe public void join room and this join room of course takes in a match description and we'll call that match great and down here we want some functionality for this but I'm just going to say debug deadlock joining and then we are going to do the underscore match dot okay cool and now in here we can simply say join game there we go join room general john room there we go okay and that's all we need to do there then in here what we can do is wait for this to refresh and then we need to just change this rule room besides him to join room instead of join game it's disappear now so that's great and hit play and now this here it's it looks like nothing has changed but basically this button has now linked itself to a method on a joint game that will make sure that it joins the game that we've clicked on so that's super cool so we can when we click this now we should actually be joining the game and that did not work there we go so joining awesome game there you can see so the first time was because I hadn't selected the window so first it selected it and then it took the button press so and you can see I can keep on doing this so and then that now works and that super great so joining awesome game and what we can then do is instead of just having it say this we should actually go ahead and make it do this and it's really really simple so this is actually the most simple step at all so we're going to go under our network manager and we're going to call something under our matchmaker cold joined match this of course takes in again a bunch of arguments and let's just see them here so first it takes in a unknit ID we get this by calling match dot it work ID then it takes in a password in our case that is just nothing and then it takes in a callback in our case that we'll just use the one on your network manager and this is the one called on join match on match joint there we go and then let's close that off then we'll also clear our room list and we will set our status text equal to joining dot dot all right so that's basically it so let's clear this out let's hit play and now we should be able to join the game and you can see here that the other client is still running the game and I can now go and hit and hit click to join so did that again there so let's it click to join here and aah that's annoying so we'll have a look at fixing that in just a moment so it I actually was able to join here and you can see that I'm now in the game so that's perfect that's working and if we go and hit play you can see it says still says two out of six but that's because I didn't disconnect probably properly I simply just hit the stop playing button here we'll have a look at this disconnecting in a proper way later so don't worry about that for now that will change at some point but you can see we can hit refresh here and that does work so that's perfect and then all I wanted to do is simply fix this problem of not hitting the button right so if we find a room list item here we can just drag it under our under join game scroll view viewport content there we go so what is the issue here we should be able to hit that it's probably our status text is above this and what I think what's happening is that we hit the status text box here maybe maybe so what we can do is simply drag this above the viewport and I actually think that might have salted it could also be that we are we're hitting this click to join but I think that would still work but I'm not a hundred percent on that so let's try and hit apply on this and just see if it's fixed already if it was that easy that would be awesome so that's yeah and now it works so that was basically all that we needed to do in order to fix that and you can see that we now have a working server browser that will display the amount of games and all that I'm just going to show you here that if I hit play and then I'll terminate my other client here actually this might not work because again I'm terminating this so if I hit play here and then yeah now it's just three out of six so that just made it a lot weirder so that's because we need to disconnect probably we'll do that in a separate video I want to create one for our passing the game and then properly disconnecting so that was it for this video I hope that you enjoyed it I know it was quite crazy all of this with delicates and UI things and networking and it is confusing it really is network games can be pain to work with sometimes but when it works it's just so rewarding and basically we're at a stage now where you can send this to all of your friends and actually have them create some rooms and jumping there and enjoy the game with them so I think that's really exciting so without further ado thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video thank you so much to all of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in July and a special thanks to vixen famous own and UK and Locke's game TV these videos wouldn't be possible without you
