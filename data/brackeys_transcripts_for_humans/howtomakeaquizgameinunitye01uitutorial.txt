00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to the first video
00:05 - in this short series on making a quiz
00:07 - game in unity using c-sharp so a lot of
00:10 - you guys have been requesting me to do
00:12 - some smaller series may be only a few
00:14 - videos long that cover how to make
00:16 - different kind of games and we are going
00:18 - to begin with a quiz game hopefully I
00:21 - will be able to teach basic
00:24 - object-oriented programming concepts we
00:27 - will also focus on how to store data and
00:30 - manipulate data in form if in the form
00:32 - of questions and then how to display
00:35 - that data in unity using unity Skua
00:38 - system so it's going to be a lot of fun
00:40 - if you are a beginner to intermediate
00:42 - user on this series is just for you and
00:45 - yeah so before we get started I just
00:48 - want to say that the multiplayer FPS
00:50 - tutorial and the 2d platformer course is
00:53 - still being worked on of course I have
00:55 - some really cool stuff coming out for
00:56 - that as well so this is just extra stuff
00:59 - don't freak out so let's just jump right
01:02 - into it so what we are going to be
01:04 - making in this video is the actual
01:07 - interface we are not going to be
01:08 - programming we are just going to be
01:10 - sketching some stuff out in unity and I
01:13 - have something really cool that we can
01:15 - use to do that so let's just make a new
01:17 - project here and I'm going to call mine
01:20 - simply quiz game and I'm going to save
01:24 - it on new projects and select 2d as
01:26 - default let's then hit create project
01:29 - and unity will open up a standard
01:31 - default project fast so that's going to
01:34 - be nothing in here what you could do now
01:36 - is simply right click here and go on the
01:38 - UI and start building the interface
01:40 - using these elements however I searched
01:43 - around a bit and I've actually found a
01:45 - really cool plugin that has some nice
01:47 - features or some nice elements that we
01:50 - can use for our interface and it's
01:52 - called
01:52 - material UI it's a unity plugin that has
01:57 - created the Google material design in
02:00 - unity so you can see all the cool
02:02 - looking elements right here that we are
02:05 - now able to use we are not going to be
02:07 - using all of the different features in
02:10 - this we're basically just going to be
02:12 - using some
02:12 - nice buttons with a cool click animation
02:16 - and some nice shadows and maybe a bit of
02:19 - the color palettes and stuff like that
02:21 - but you can really create some advanced
02:23 - stuff with this this package costs about
02:27 - $50 on the assets story so if you don't
02:31 - have that money and I definitely don't
02:32 - expect you to buy this you can either
02:34 - follow along and unity' using the normal
02:36 - stuff or do as I will do in this video
02:39 - and use the beta version before the
02:43 - official release release which is still
02:46 - publicly available on github so you're
02:48 - fine to use this this is licensed under
02:50 - the Apache License and you can
02:53 - definitely use this commercially so I'm
02:56 - going to have a link to this skip github
02:58 - page where you can download it in the
02:59 - description again should the link be
03:01 - broken or the stuff be taking down you
03:04 - can either sacrifice the money and get
03:06 - this really cool plug-in or just use the
03:08 - default stuff in unity it's going to be
03:10 - just as fine there's nothing we are
03:12 - going to be using here that you can't do
03:13 - in unity so let's click material UI
03:16 - unity package for the latest release and
03:19 - you can see that it will be downloading
03:21 - down here as soon as it stops
03:23 - downloading we can simply click on this
03:25 - to open it up in unity that's the cool
03:27 - thing about unity packages they are
03:29 - completely wrapped finished packages
03:33 - that you can import into unity and it
03:36 - will take care of structuring everything
03:38 - together and all that so you can see we
03:40 - have this material UI folder which with
03:42 - a bunch of different assets inside and
03:45 - we're just going to import them all here
03:47 - so this might take a little while
03:49 - depending on your computer because this
03:52 - material UI plugin has a lot of elements
03:55 - in it I've used it for several product
03:58 - and projects now and I've been really
04:00 - fond of using it so especially
04:03 - especially for the animations which are
04:05 - really really well done so we should get
04:09 - hopefully no errors you might get a
04:10 - warning here that's just complaining
04:12 - about some line endings so I'm just
04:14 - going to clear that that's definitely
04:15 - not on the to-do list so let's hop into
04:18 - the material UI folder and you can see
04:21 - that they've even included a star die
04:23 - scene this just has a standard
04:25 - camera with a white color it has a
04:28 - canvas with some different settings on
04:32 - it and just an event system which
04:34 - follows in any kind of canvas so you can
04:37 - see in the game right now we just have
04:39 - this right white screen so let's go
04:42 - ahead and add an element to this let's
04:44 - right click on the canvas let's go under
04:46 - material UI instead of UI and you can
04:49 - see we have a lot of a lot of different
04:51 - stuff just as in the unity we have a
04:53 - text as we have under the unity UI you
04:56 - also have a text here and a panel and
04:58 - all that stuff but we also have some
05:00 - extra elements such as radio buttons
05:03 - which is some selection boxes and stuff
05:07 - like that you can go crazy playing
05:09 - around with these so what we are going
05:11 - to select is just panel I want to make
05:13 - the panel from where we will select our
05:15 - question so you can see that it's
05:17 - already added this nice panel with some
05:20 - rounded edges and a cool shadow I'm
05:23 - going to make this darker so let's
05:25 - select our main camera and change the
05:26 - background color and if you've gone to
05:28 - presets here and click this button right
05:31 - here and you instead of having just the
05:33 - default you can change to one of these
05:37 - project presets right here and those are
05:40 - included with the material UI so I'm
05:44 - just going to select basics here and we
05:46 - can select the basic back dark
05:48 - background color here then we can find
05:51 - our panel open that go and do panel
05:53 - layer and let's change this color to the
05:56 - same one except maybe just a bit
05:59 - brighter there so something like this
06:01 - looks pretty good now we can select the
06:04 - entire panel and let's hold down alt and
06:09 - while we scale it on the horizontal axis
06:14 - almost all the way over here and let's
06:17 - now drag it up a bit something like
06:21 - there and then also scale it up
06:25 - something like that I think that looks
06:28 - pretty nice and you can always change
06:30 - this later
06:31 - now let's anchor this correctly so that
06:33 - it will scale correctly with the screen
06:35 - so let's first off yeah let's
06:39 - choose this one so it will stretch
06:41 - horizontally and be anchored to the top
06:44 - so if we now move our canvas here oops
06:47 - if we move our canvas you can see that
06:50 - it will follow and if we move the top
06:52 - here you can see that it will just
06:53 - follow the top but not scale vertically
06:56 - so that's perfect
06:57 - and what we can do is just take our
06:59 - scene view and put that over here this
07:02 - way we can have a nice preview of our
07:03 - game here and work on the right hand
07:06 - side so the next thing that we need to
07:08 - add is a couple of buttons that we can
07:11 - click I want our quiz game to have two
07:14 - states either the question is true or
07:17 - its false and depending on what you are
07:20 - choose you can get either a Kuwait
07:22 - correct answer or a wrong answer so
07:26 - that's kind of how we will model this
07:28 - out
07:28 - you could definitely have different
07:30 - options here you could say in what year
07:33 - was Jason born created and then you can
07:37 - have three different options if you want
07:39 - and that's completely fine it's the same
07:42 - basic concepts but I think for
07:44 - simplicity we're only going to have two
07:46 - so let's go under cabinets let's
07:48 - right-click that and go under your
07:50 - material UI and let's select a button
07:53 - and it's going to be a text raised so
07:57 - you can see just how that looks and
07:59 - let's take this button and let's drag it
08:02 - over so it's aligned with the center and
08:05 - let's drag it up so it's aligned with
08:07 - our panel there and drag it down so it's
08:09 - around line with our bottom and let's
08:12 - take the same button and we don't want
08:15 - to align it here we want these surfaces
08:17 - to a line you can see that the box here
08:19 - is a bit bigger than the button itself
08:21 - that's because we have the shadow in
08:24 - there too so we'll have to drag it out
08:26 - here and just do an eye measurement that
08:28 - looks good used to create to align them
08:30 - there and you can see that that looks
08:32 - just like a sharp edge over there
08:36 - something like that looks pretty good
08:38 - and now we can go ahead and configure
08:40 - this button a bit so if we go under here
08:43 - actually let's just rename our panel
08:45 - here this is going to be the question
08:47 - panel weight statement pan
08:51 - panel whatever you want to call it and
08:54 - this down here is going to be the true
08:58 - button and we can go into the button
09:02 - layer go into the button text and let's
09:06 - delete the snap button to text because
09:09 - we don't want the size of our button to
09:11 - be controlled by the text and now we can
09:14 - take the font size here and scale that
09:16 - up dramatically let's also change the
09:20 - font type here from maybe Roboto regular
09:23 - to a Roboto a medium that looks pretty
09:27 - good and we also want to change the
09:30 - color here to a white down here using
09:32 - the preset that looks cool let's change
09:36 - the text here to true and then we can
09:41 - maybe scale it up a bit further
09:43 - something like that then we can take the
09:46 - button layer itself and let's make this
09:48 - a light blue something like that looks
09:57 - pretty good and yeah I think we will
10:00 - begin with that at least I actually want
10:02 - this text maybe to be just a bit wider
10:05 - or something like that and then let's
10:10 - make a second button so let's duplicate
10:12 - this true button let's move it over just
10:15 - like this so it's aligned let's make
10:18 - this the false button so change the name
10:20 - here to a false button and by the way to
10:22 - duplicate it I simply pressed ctrl D or
10:25 - command D if you're on the Mac let's go
10:27 - to the button layer and let's first
10:28 - change the color here want it to be
10:31 - completely red and actually the tint
10:34 - already looks very nice so maybe just a
10:36 - bit more saturated there and that looks
10:39 - super cool let's I open this up and go
10:42 - to button text and let's change this to
10:45 - false so there we go we have very
10:48 - clearly indicated with both both of
10:51 - colors and font that these are polar
10:54 - opposites now what we can do is maybe
10:58 - scale these buttons in a bit I think
11:00 - they're a bit too far apart so we can
11:03 - maybe just take this
11:04 - and if we okay so let's anchor them
11:08 - correctly first actually so let's take
11:10 - the true and the false button and change
11:13 - their anchors so we basically want them
11:17 - to scale with the entire screen on one
11:22 - axis but only half the screen on another
11:25 - axis so we want them to scale around the
11:28 - center here and then half the horizontal
11:34 - width yeah good so in order to do that
11:38 - let's make them stretch here and simply
11:40 - click that down here and then we'll make
11:42 - sure that if our canvas scales on the Y
11:46 - you can see that the button scale with
11:49 - it
11:49 - however it's not currently good on the X
11:52 - so we will select our true button and
11:55 - we'll take this Oh we'll take this
11:59 - anchor here if I can just click it there
12:02 - we go and move this all the way over
12:05 - this way when I resize the canvas you
12:08 - can see that that resizes in a nice way
12:12 - resizes with this part of the screen
12:14 - then we can take the false button and do
12:17 - the same except now we take the right
12:19 - part here and drag it all the way over
12:21 - so now when I resize the screen you can
12:23 - see just what happens here so that's
12:26 - actually completely perfect and if you
12:29 - want kind of a very tall the odd look
12:32 - the text is going to be clipping and
12:34 - this is not going to be looking nice
12:36 - anymore but then you might look into
12:38 - resizing the text or anything like that
12:41 - but for now we're just going to make it
12:43 - look great for this format what we can
12:46 - then do with the button says we can have
12:47 - this go a bit to the right so we'll
12:50 - maybe put in a negative 10 there and do
12:53 - the same with the false here so let's do
12:55 - negative 10 for the left so now they are
12:58 - just a bit closer together and I think
13:00 - that looks even better and then we can
13:03 - take the true/false and question panel
13:06 - and we can maybe just move them all up a
13:09 - bit just so they are completely centered
13:11 - on the screen and we could even go ahead
13:14 - and just scale it out just a tad
13:17 - so it fills almost the entire screen
13:23 - that looks great okay so I'm actually
13:26 - really satisfied with that I'm think
13:28 - we're going to stick with that for now
13:30 - you can always change this and spend
13:32 - more time on time on it than I do then
13:35 - under the question panel we want to
13:37 - right click go on to material UI and
13:40 - select text and we want to of course
13:42 - instead sort our actual question or
13:45 - statement of fact or whatever you want
13:47 - to call this we are just going to call
13:48 - it the question and we want this to be
13:51 - on this is a question actually it's a
14:00 - place holder good and will of course be
14:04 - changing this through code so it doesn't
14:06 - make sense to spend a lot of time
14:08 - thinking about what this should say
14:10 - let's just scale that up I'm holding
14:12 - down alt and clicking here to make it
14:14 - scale with the entire panel and then
14:16 - we'll send you that on both the X and
14:19 - the y then we'll scale up the fund
14:25 - something like that let's make this the
14:29 - white color down in the presets here and
14:31 - I think that actually looks good you
14:33 - could go ahead and change the fund if
14:35 - you want a different look but I actually
14:37 - really like this and that's basically it
14:39 - I mean now we've created our UI and I'm
14:41 - going to show you just how cool the
14:43 - material UI plucking is because when I
14:46 - go ahead and hit play now
14:47 - we are not going to have any borrowing
14:50 - animations but if I click this you can
14:54 - see I get this really cool looking
14:56 - ripple effect so that's super awesome if
15:00 - you want a bit more of a hover animation
15:02 - you can see that currently when I
15:04 - hovered we do get a bit more shadow but
15:06 - we can also make it tint a bit so let's
15:08 - go and do that let's select our true
15:11 - button go into the button layer and do
15:14 - the same thing with the false button
15:16 - select both button layers excuse me the
15:21 - shadow normal size I want to change that
15:23 - to two and the shadow access active size
15:25 - I want to change that to three and then
15:28 - I wanted to also highlight when
15:31 - hover it so now when we play you can see
15:34 - that the shadow is a bit more clear and
15:37 - they actually tense so they react to the
15:40 - mouse hovering over and we still get
15:42 - that really cool ripple effect so that
15:46 - was basically it for this video I hope
15:48 - you enjoyed it and I'm definitely
15:49 - looking forward to the next one so
15:51 - thanks for watching and I'll see you in
15:54 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to the first video in this short series on making a quiz game in unity using csharp so a lot of you guys have been requesting me to do some smaller series may be only a few videos long that cover how to make different kind of games and we are going to begin with a quiz game hopefully I will be able to teach basic objectoriented programming concepts we will also focus on how to store data and manipulate data in form if in the form of questions and then how to display that data in unity using unity Skua system so it's going to be a lot of fun if you are a beginner to intermediate user on this series is just for you and yeah so before we get started I just want to say that the multiplayer FPS tutorial and the 2d platformer course is still being worked on of course I have some really cool stuff coming out for that as well so this is just extra stuff don't freak out so let's just jump right into it so what we are going to be making in this video is the actual interface we are not going to be programming we are just going to be sketching some stuff out in unity and I have something really cool that we can use to do that so let's just make a new project here and I'm going to call mine simply quiz game and I'm going to save it on new projects and select 2d as default let's then hit create project and unity will open up a standard default project fast so that's going to be nothing in here what you could do now is simply right click here and go on the UI and start building the interface using these elements however I searched around a bit and I've actually found a really cool plugin that has some nice features or some nice elements that we can use for our interface and it's called material UI it's a unity plugin that has created the Google material design in unity so you can see all the cool looking elements right here that we are now able to use we are not going to be using all of the different features in this we're basically just going to be using some nice buttons with a cool click animation and some nice shadows and maybe a bit of the color palettes and stuff like that but you can really create some advanced stuff with this this package costs about $50 on the assets story so if you don't have that money and I definitely don't expect you to buy this you can either follow along and unity' using the normal stuff or do as I will do in this video and use the beta version before the official release release which is still publicly available on github so you're fine to use this this is licensed under the Apache License and you can definitely use this commercially so I'm going to have a link to this skip github page where you can download it in the description again should the link be broken or the stuff be taking down you can either sacrifice the money and get this really cool plugin or just use the default stuff in unity it's going to be just as fine there's nothing we are going to be using here that you can't do in unity so let's click material UI unity package for the latest release and you can see that it will be downloading down here as soon as it stops downloading we can simply click on this to open it up in unity that's the cool thing about unity packages they are completely wrapped finished packages that you can import into unity and it will take care of structuring everything together and all that so you can see we have this material UI folder which with a bunch of different assets inside and we're just going to import them all here so this might take a little while depending on your computer because this material UI plugin has a lot of elements in it I've used it for several product and projects now and I've been really fond of using it so especially especially for the animations which are really really well done so we should get hopefully no errors you might get a warning here that's just complaining about some line endings so I'm just going to clear that that's definitely not on the todo list so let's hop into the material UI folder and you can see that they've even included a star die scene this just has a standard camera with a white color it has a canvas with some different settings on it and just an event system which follows in any kind of canvas so you can see in the game right now we just have this right white screen so let's go ahead and add an element to this let's right click on the canvas let's go under material UI instead of UI and you can see we have a lot of a lot of different stuff just as in the unity we have a text as we have under the unity UI you also have a text here and a panel and all that stuff but we also have some extra elements such as radio buttons which is some selection boxes and stuff like that you can go crazy playing around with these so what we are going to select is just panel I want to make the panel from where we will select our question so you can see that it's already added this nice panel with some rounded edges and a cool shadow I'm going to make this darker so let's select our main camera and change the background color and if you've gone to presets here and click this button right here and you instead of having just the default you can change to one of these project presets right here and those are included with the material UI so I'm just going to select basics here and we can select the basic back dark background color here then we can find our panel open that go and do panel layer and let's change this color to the same one except maybe just a bit brighter there so something like this looks pretty good now we can select the entire panel and let's hold down alt and while we scale it on the horizontal axis almost all the way over here and let's now drag it up a bit something like there and then also scale it up something like that I think that looks pretty nice and you can always change this later now let's anchor this correctly so that it will scale correctly with the screen so let's first off yeah let's choose this one so it will stretch horizontally and be anchored to the top so if we now move our canvas here oops if we move our canvas you can see that it will follow and if we move the top here you can see that it will just follow the top but not scale vertically so that's perfect and what we can do is just take our scene view and put that over here this way we can have a nice preview of our game here and work on the right hand side so the next thing that we need to add is a couple of buttons that we can click I want our quiz game to have two states either the question is true or its false and depending on what you are choose you can get either a Kuwait correct answer or a wrong answer so that's kind of how we will model this out you could definitely have different options here you could say in what year was Jason born created and then you can have three different options if you want and that's completely fine it's the same basic concepts but I think for simplicity we're only going to have two so let's go under cabinets let's rightclick that and go under your material UI and let's select a button and it's going to be a text raised so you can see just how that looks and let's take this button and let's drag it over so it's aligned with the center and let's drag it up so it's aligned with our panel there and drag it down so it's around line with our bottom and let's take the same button and we don't want to align it here we want these surfaces to a line you can see that the box here is a bit bigger than the button itself that's because we have the shadow in there too so we'll have to drag it out here and just do an eye measurement that looks good used to create to align them there and you can see that that looks just like a sharp edge over there something like that looks pretty good and now we can go ahead and configure this button a bit so if we go under here actually let's just rename our panel here this is going to be the question panel weight statement pan panel whatever you want to call it and this down here is going to be the true button and we can go into the button layer go into the button text and let's delete the snap button to text because we don't want the size of our button to be controlled by the text and now we can take the font size here and scale that up dramatically let's also change the font type here from maybe Roboto regular to a Roboto a medium that looks pretty good and we also want to change the color here to a white down here using the preset that looks cool let's change the text here to true and then we can maybe scale it up a bit further something like that then we can take the button layer itself and let's make this a light blue something like that looks pretty good and yeah I think we will begin with that at least I actually want this text maybe to be just a bit wider or something like that and then let's make a second button so let's duplicate this true button let's move it over just like this so it's aligned let's make this the false button so change the name here to a false button and by the way to duplicate it I simply pressed ctrl D or command D if you're on the Mac let's go to the button layer and let's first change the color here want it to be completely red and actually the tint already looks very nice so maybe just a bit more saturated there and that looks super cool let's I open this up and go to button text and let's change this to false so there we go we have very clearly indicated with both both of colors and font that these are polar opposites now what we can do is maybe scale these buttons in a bit I think they're a bit too far apart so we can maybe just take this and if we okay so let's anchor them correctly first actually so let's take the true and the false button and change their anchors so we basically want them to scale with the entire screen on one axis but only half the screen on another axis so we want them to scale around the center here and then half the horizontal width yeah good so in order to do that let's make them stretch here and simply click that down here and then we'll make sure that if our canvas scales on the Y you can see that the button scale with it however it's not currently good on the X so we will select our true button and we'll take this Oh we'll take this anchor here if I can just click it there we go and move this all the way over this way when I resize the canvas you can see that that resizes in a nice way resizes with this part of the screen then we can take the false button and do the same except now we take the right part here and drag it all the way over so now when I resize the screen you can see just what happens here so that's actually completely perfect and if you want kind of a very tall the odd look the text is going to be clipping and this is not going to be looking nice anymore but then you might look into resizing the text or anything like that but for now we're just going to make it look great for this format what we can then do with the button says we can have this go a bit to the right so we'll maybe put in a negative 10 there and do the same with the false here so let's do negative 10 for the left so now they are just a bit closer together and I think that looks even better and then we can take the true/false and question panel and we can maybe just move them all up a bit just so they are completely centered on the screen and we could even go ahead and just scale it out just a tad so it fills almost the entire screen that looks great okay so I'm actually really satisfied with that I'm think we're going to stick with that for now you can always change this and spend more time on time on it than I do then under the question panel we want to right click go on to material UI and select text and we want to of course instead sort our actual question or statement of fact or whatever you want to call this we are just going to call it the question and we want this to be on this is a question actually it's a place holder good and will of course be changing this through code so it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time thinking about what this should say let's just scale that up I'm holding down alt and clicking here to make it scale with the entire panel and then we'll send you that on both the X and the y then we'll scale up the fund something like that let's make this the white color down in the presets here and I think that actually looks good you could go ahead and change the fund if you want a different look but I actually really like this and that's basically it I mean now we've created our UI and I'm going to show you just how cool the material UI plucking is because when I go ahead and hit play now we are not going to have any borrowing animations but if I click this you can see I get this really cool looking ripple effect so that's super awesome if you want a bit more of a hover animation you can see that currently when I hovered we do get a bit more shadow but we can also make it tint a bit so let's go and do that let's select our true button go into the button layer and do the same thing with the false button select both button layers excuse me the shadow normal size I want to change that to two and the shadow access active size I want to change that to three and then I wanted to also highlight when hover it so now when we play you can see that the shadow is a bit more clear and they actually tense so they react to the mouse hovering over and we still get that really cool ripple effect so that was basically it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'm definitely looking forward to the next one so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
