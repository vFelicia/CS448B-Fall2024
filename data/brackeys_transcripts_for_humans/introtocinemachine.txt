00:00 - in this video we'll have a look at
00:01 - cinema Sheen and how I can use it to
00:02 - create awesome camera behavior in your
00:04 - game we'll also try to use it with
00:06 - timeline to create a cool cutscene
00:08 - sequence before we get started I just
00:09 - want to mention that I've recreated the
00:11 - brekkie site so it should not be much
00:13 - faster and prettier you can check it out
00:15 - at Brock acecomm alright let's get
00:17 - started
00:17 - so here's the simple scene using the Luo
00:19 - character from the atom demo and of
00:21 - course a main camera that currently
00:22 - points towards this character and we
00:24 - want to use cinema sheen to bring this
00:26 - to life
00:26 - well Senna machine isn't part of the
00:28 - editor by default so we need to go to
00:30 - the asset store search for cinema sheen
00:33 - click the first one here it's free and
00:34 - we need to download and import it the
00:36 - download should be really quick and you
00:38 - can just hit import and now you should
00:39 - see a cinema sheen folder in your
00:41 - project then we want to select our main
00:43 - camera and here we want to add a new
00:45 - component now we can go on the cinema
00:47 - scene and select the cinema sheen brain
00:49 - we don't need to adjust any settings
00:50 - here but now this component will link up
00:52 - all of our camera settings and they
00:54 - transform to the cinema Sheen system and
00:56 - now we're ready to get started so the
00:58 - first thing that we'll do is go to
00:59 - cinema Sheen and create a new virtual
01:01 - camera you can see that this now creates
01:03 - a new game object in our scene with a
01:05 - cinema sheen virtual camera component as
01:08 - with a normal camera we can now move
01:09 - this around as well as rotate it in
01:12 - order to position it correctly and you
01:14 - can see that whenever we have the camera
01:15 - selected we have these guides to help us
01:17 - position our camera for now we'll just
01:18 - ignore these so basically what we can do
01:21 - now is adjust this virtual camera to any
01:23 - position that we want and then cinema
01:25 - Sheen we'll put our main camera at the
01:27 - same position using the same settings
01:29 - this is cool because it allows us to
01:30 - create multiple virtual cameras and
01:33 - position them around our scene but right
01:35 - now our virtual camera is static so if
01:37 - we go ahead and hit play we can see that
01:39 - our character moves right through it we
01:40 - can change this by giving a virtual
01:42 - camera a target to follow we can simply
01:45 - take our Luo character and drag her into
01:47 - this slot now by default this might
01:49 - position your camera really weirdly it
01:51 - snapped ours all the way to the back
01:53 - here that's because we need to go under
01:54 - the body this is where we adjust the
01:57 - position of our camera and here we have
01:59 - a follow-up set that's currently set to
02:01 - negative ten on the Z let's go ahead and
02:03 - adjust this to be infront of the
02:04 - character
02:05 - let's also move it up on the Y and now
02:07 - we can play with these to get a nice
02:09 - position on our camera then when we play
02:11 - the game our camera will
02:13 - we follow our character you also see
02:15 - that our camera responds to all of our
02:16 - characters movements this is nice but I
02:18 - definitely want our camera to act
02:20 - smoother to change this let's go into
02:22 - the body and let's increase damping this
02:25 - means that it will take longer for the
02:27 - camera to adjust to new positions which
02:29 - will give us a more heavy and smooth
02:30 - camera feel I'm gonna set the X&Y
02:32 - damming up to something like sex and
02:34 - I'll keep the Z damming to one that's
02:36 - because I want our camera to follow our
02:38 - character pretty tightly on the Z when
02:40 - he's moving forward but I would like the
02:41 - changes on the y and X to be more
02:44 - smoothed out if we now hit play you can
02:46 - see that movement is a lot smoother on
02:48 - the X and y so it's really easy to get
02:50 - your camera to follow a moving target
02:52 - our character moves using animation but
02:54 - you can use the exact same method for
02:56 - tracking characters that are controlled
02:57 - by the player but right now we're only
02:59 - tracking the position of our character
03:01 - let's try and go to cinema Sheen and
03:02 - create another virtual camera now we can
03:04 - use our scene view to find a good angle
03:06 - on our character we can then make sure
03:08 - to select the camera and inside the
03:10 - scene view we'll press ctrl shift F you
03:13 - can do the same by going game object and
03:15 - selecting align with view I use this
03:17 - method all the time for finding good
03:18 - angles inside the scene view now this
03:20 - time we don't want the camera to follow
03:22 - the precision of our character we want
03:24 - it to stay in place but we wanted to
03:25 - always look at our character more
03:28 - specifically we wanted to look at the
03:30 - chest of our character so I'm gonna take
03:32 - loose body here and drag it into a look
03:35 - at target and you can see immediately
03:36 - that our camera snaps in place now if we
03:39 - hit play cinema Sheen will show our
03:41 - first camera you can always change
03:42 - between what camera you want cinema
03:44 - scene to display by changing the
03:46 - priority higher numbers means higher
03:48 - priority so if we wanted to show this
03:50 - second camera instead we would simply
03:52 - amp up our priority I'm just gonna set
03:54 - this to 15 so if you now hit play we can
03:56 - see that our camera always looks towards
03:58 - our character and we can of course
03:59 - adjust the way that this is done as well
04:01 - to do that we go under aim here we can
04:04 - have the ability to offset the camera we
04:06 - can also dampen its rotation and of
04:08 - course we have a bunch of framing
04:10 - controls we'll have a look at these in a
04:11 - second but let's first increase timing
04:13 - on x and y to say for now when we play
04:16 - we should see that camera movement is a
04:17 - lot smoother but the main strength of
04:19 - cinema sheen is to easily switch between
04:21 - cameras to do that we can use timeline
04:24 - to open this we'll go window
04:26 - and select the timeline editor let's
04:27 - drag this to the bottom to learn how to
04:29 - use timeline you can watch my separate
04:31 - video on this subject or you can just
04:33 - try and follow along here we now want to
04:35 - create an empty object fall of our
04:36 - timeline data let's right-click go
04:38 - create empty and let's call this
04:39 - timeline let's reset the transform and
04:42 - now at the bottom here we can hit create
04:44 - this is going to create a playable for a
04:46 - timeline we can call this cutscene and
04:48 - this make sure to set up all the
04:49 - components that we need for our timeline
04:51 - as well as a basic track we can just go
04:53 - ahead and delete this track instead
04:55 - let's go in and add an animation track
04:57 - here we'll drag in our Luo character we
05:00 - also right click and hit add from
05:02 - animation clip here we want to select
05:03 - loose
05:04 - walk animation and now we can use our
05:06 - timeline to scrub through the walking
05:07 - I'm also just going to make this clip
05:09 - longer which means that it's just going
05:11 - to be repeating now we're ready to add a
05:13 - cinema scene track to do that we can
05:15 - simply drag in our main camera where our
05:17 - brain sets release and select cinema
05:20 - Sheen track this is where we'll place
05:22 - all of our individual camera shots let's
05:24 - right-click hid adds in a machine shot
05:26 - clip and here we get to choose what
05:28 - virtual camera we'll use for the shot
05:30 - I'm just gonna drag in our first one you
05:32 - can see now that during this part of the
05:33 - clip will use the first virtual camera
05:35 - we then right-click and add another
05:37 - cinema sheen shot and this time that's
05:39 - dragging our second virtual camera you
05:41 - can see now that once we get to this
05:43 - shot cinema scene cuts to the new
05:45 - virtual camera so this is already really
05:47 - really cool and we can easily use this
05:49 - to start creating our own cutscenes
05:51 - let's try and decrease the duration of
05:53 - our first shot let's have it switch over
05:55 - to our second shot
05:56 - let's also decrease the duration on that
05:58 - let's try and hit play to preview it so
06:03 - that's already looking pretty cool but I
06:05 - still don't think the framing is right
06:07 - on our second shot let's try and select
06:09 - it let's open up our aim section and now
06:11 - let's try and change the composition of
06:13 - this shot so the main thing to know
06:14 - about here is the dead zone that's the
06:17 - tiny square in the center what this
06:19 - means is that any movement from within
06:21 - this zone will not cause the camera to
06:23 - rotate so you can see if I move our
06:25 - character back and forth here a camera
06:27 - stays still it's only once he moves
06:29 - outside of this zone that the camera
06:31 - starts rotating you also notice that the
06:34 - tracking point actually gets pretty far
06:36 - away from the dead zone that's only
06:38 - because of our damping
06:39 - if we were to decrease damming to zero
06:41 - you'll see that our camera will always
06:43 - rotate to make sure that our tracking
06:45 - point is within the dead zone now I
06:47 - don't really want a dead zone for this
06:48 - camera I wanted to follow our character
06:50 - with a constant movement so I'm gonna
06:52 - take our dead zone width and height and
06:54 - decrease it to serum I do want a bit of
06:56 - damping though so I'm gonna up this to
06:58 - four by four now I can see that if we
07:00 - hit play a camera will try and follow
07:02 - our character's movement but it will
07:04 - currently try and place him in the
07:05 - center to change this we can change a
07:07 - screen x and y this will allow us to
07:10 - reposition a focus point on the screen
07:12 - so I'm gonna drag it backwards here and
07:14 - maybe a tiny bit down let's play it back
07:16 - and see how it looks now I like that a
07:18 - lot better
07:19 - but I still think we are missing a shot
07:21 - let's go to cinema Sheen and create a
07:23 - third virtual camera
07:24 - let's also drag our timeline here to the
07:26 - top so we can always know where it is
07:27 - and let's now select our third camera of
07:30 - course this is currently not being shown
07:31 - inside of the game view because it has a
07:33 - lower priority luckily we can always
07:35 - click Solo in order to preview a
07:37 - particular camera now we'd like to
07:39 - create kind of an oval shoulder shot and
07:41 - so I would like this to follow our
07:43 - camera as we've done before we're then
07:45 - going to take a little character and
07:46 - drag him in under the follow slot I'm
07:48 - just gonna aim the camera myself so I'm
07:50 - going to collapse this section and
07:52 - instead open up body here we can again
07:54 - adjust the follow offset I want to zoom
07:56 - in quite a bit definitely move the
07:57 - camera up and also move it over a bit
07:59 - because we currently don't have a look
08:01 - at we can of course rotate the camera in
08:03 - any way that we'd want and once you're
08:04 - happy with the framing let's go ahead
08:05 - and disable solar mode then let's select
08:07 - our timeline that's right click go adds
08:10 - in a machine shot clip and it's adding a
08:12 - third virtual camera let's move forward
08:14 - in time and again I want Z damming to be
08:17 - one extending to be four and y damming
08:19 - to before and let's see how that looks
08:21 - really cool let's decrease the length of
08:24 - this clip to fit with the animation and
08:25 - we should see that our cutscene now
08:27 - plays nicely but that's one more feature
08:29 - in cinema Sheen that could really help
08:31 - this pop I'm of course talking about
08:33 - camera blending right now when we
08:35 - transition from the second clip to the
08:37 - third we do that using a simple cut
08:40 - instead that select our second camera
08:42 - and that's simply drag to extend it onto
08:44 - a third camera what this will do is
08:46 - procedurally animate the position of our
08:48 - camera in a way that it looks over his
08:51 - shoulder much cooler than a
08:52 - so now if we try and play the game we
08:54 - can view our entire cutscene in sequence
08:59 - awesome that's pretty much it for this
09:01 - video if you enjoyed it make sure to
09:03 - subscribe so don't miss a future one I
09:04 - think's in a machine and timeline
09:06 - especially when bundled together is a
09:07 - really cool set of tools for designers
09:10 - and it's definitely a step in the right
09:11 - direction for unity I expect to see a
09:13 - lot more short films made with unity
09:15 - because of these toes if you make
09:16 - something cool definitely shared with me
09:18 - on Twitter at practice three on that

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we'll have a look at cinema Sheen and how I can use it to create awesome camera behavior in your game we'll also try to use it with timeline to create a cool cutscene sequence before we get started I just want to mention that I've recreated the brekkie site so it should not be much faster and prettier you can check it out at Brock acecomm alright let's get started so here's the simple scene using the Luo character from the atom demo and of course a main camera that currently points towards this character and we want to use cinema sheen to bring this to life well Senna machine isn't part of the editor by default so we need to go to the asset store search for cinema sheen click the first one here it's free and we need to download and import it the download should be really quick and you can just hit import and now you should see a cinema sheen folder in your project then we want to select our main camera and here we want to add a new component now we can go on the cinema scene and select the cinema sheen brain we don't need to adjust any settings here but now this component will link up all of our camera settings and they transform to the cinema Sheen system and now we're ready to get started so the first thing that we'll do is go to cinema Sheen and create a new virtual camera you can see that this now creates a new game object in our scene with a cinema sheen virtual camera component as with a normal camera we can now move this around as well as rotate it in order to position it correctly and you can see that whenever we have the camera selected we have these guides to help us position our camera for now we'll just ignore these so basically what we can do now is adjust this virtual camera to any position that we want and then cinema Sheen we'll put our main camera at the same position using the same settings this is cool because it allows us to create multiple virtual cameras and position them around our scene but right now our virtual camera is static so if we go ahead and hit play we can see that our character moves right through it we can change this by giving a virtual camera a target to follow we can simply take our Luo character and drag her into this slot now by default this might position your camera really weirdly it snapped ours all the way to the back here that's because we need to go under the body this is where we adjust the position of our camera and here we have a followup set that's currently set to negative ten on the Z let's go ahead and adjust this to be infront of the character let's also move it up on the Y and now we can play with these to get a nice position on our camera then when we play the game our camera will we follow our character you also see that our camera responds to all of our characters movements this is nice but I definitely want our camera to act smoother to change this let's go into the body and let's increase damping this means that it will take longer for the camera to adjust to new positions which will give us a more heavy and smooth camera feel I'm gonna set the X&Y damming up to something like sex and I'll keep the Z damming to one that's because I want our camera to follow our character pretty tightly on the Z when he's moving forward but I would like the changes on the y and X to be more smoothed out if we now hit play you can see that movement is a lot smoother on the X and y so it's really easy to get your camera to follow a moving target our character moves using animation but you can use the exact same method for tracking characters that are controlled by the player but right now we're only tracking the position of our character let's try and go to cinema Sheen and create another virtual camera now we can use our scene view to find a good angle on our character we can then make sure to select the camera and inside the scene view we'll press ctrl shift F you can do the same by going game object and selecting align with view I use this method all the time for finding good angles inside the scene view now this time we don't want the camera to follow the precision of our character we want it to stay in place but we wanted to always look at our character more specifically we wanted to look at the chest of our character so I'm gonna take loose body here and drag it into a look at target and you can see immediately that our camera snaps in place now if we hit play cinema Sheen will show our first camera you can always change between what camera you want cinema scene to display by changing the priority higher numbers means higher priority so if we wanted to show this second camera instead we would simply amp up our priority I'm just gonna set this to 15 so if you now hit play we can see that our camera always looks towards our character and we can of course adjust the way that this is done as well to do that we go under aim here we can have the ability to offset the camera we can also dampen its rotation and of course we have a bunch of framing controls we'll have a look at these in a second but let's first increase timing on x and y to say for now when we play we should see that camera movement is a lot smoother but the main strength of cinema sheen is to easily switch between cameras to do that we can use timeline to open this we'll go window and select the timeline editor let's drag this to the bottom to learn how to use timeline you can watch my separate video on this subject or you can just try and follow along here we now want to create an empty object fall of our timeline data let's rightclick go create empty and let's call this timeline let's reset the transform and now at the bottom here we can hit create this is going to create a playable for a timeline we can call this cutscene and this make sure to set up all the components that we need for our timeline as well as a basic track we can just go ahead and delete this track instead let's go in and add an animation track here we'll drag in our Luo character we also right click and hit add from animation clip here we want to select loose walk animation and now we can use our timeline to scrub through the walking I'm also just going to make this clip longer which means that it's just going to be repeating now we're ready to add a cinema scene track to do that we can simply drag in our main camera where our brain sets release and select cinema Sheen track this is where we'll place all of our individual camera shots let's rightclick hid adds in a machine shot clip and here we get to choose what virtual camera we'll use for the shot I'm just gonna drag in our first one you can see now that during this part of the clip will use the first virtual camera we then rightclick and add another cinema sheen shot and this time that's dragging our second virtual camera you can see now that once we get to this shot cinema scene cuts to the new virtual camera so this is already really really cool and we can easily use this to start creating our own cutscenes let's try and decrease the duration of our first shot let's have it switch over to our second shot let's also decrease the duration on that let's try and hit play to preview it so that's already looking pretty cool but I still don't think the framing is right on our second shot let's try and select it let's open up our aim section and now let's try and change the composition of this shot so the main thing to know about here is the dead zone that's the tiny square in the center what this means is that any movement from within this zone will not cause the camera to rotate so you can see if I move our character back and forth here a camera stays still it's only once he moves outside of this zone that the camera starts rotating you also notice that the tracking point actually gets pretty far away from the dead zone that's only because of our damping if we were to decrease damming to zero you'll see that our camera will always rotate to make sure that our tracking point is within the dead zone now I don't really want a dead zone for this camera I wanted to follow our character with a constant movement so I'm gonna take our dead zone width and height and decrease it to serum I do want a bit of damping though so I'm gonna up this to four by four now I can see that if we hit play a camera will try and follow our character's movement but it will currently try and place him in the center to change this we can change a screen x and y this will allow us to reposition a focus point on the screen so I'm gonna drag it backwards here and maybe a tiny bit down let's play it back and see how it looks now I like that a lot better but I still think we are missing a shot let's go to cinema Sheen and create a third virtual camera let's also drag our timeline here to the top so we can always know where it is and let's now select our third camera of course this is currently not being shown inside of the game view because it has a lower priority luckily we can always click Solo in order to preview a particular camera now we'd like to create kind of an oval shoulder shot and so I would like this to follow our camera as we've

we can again adjust the follow offset I want to zoom in quite a bit definitely move the camera up and also move it over a bit because we currently don't have a look at we can of course rotate the camera in any way that we'd want and once you're happy with the framing let's go ahead and disable solar mode then let's select our timeline that's right click go adds in a machine shot clip and it's adding a third virtual camera let's move forward in time and again I want Z damming to be one extending to be four and y damming to before and let's see how that looks really cool let's decrease the
