00:00 - before when creating a new unity project
00:02 - you've got to choose between 2d and 3d
00:03 - harbors some of you might have noticed
00:06 - that we now have two new templates to
00:07 - choose between I'm of course talking
00:09 - about the High Definition template and
00:11 - the Universal template these two
00:12 - templates take advantage of unities new
00:14 - scriptable render pipeline and unity is
00:16 - working towards making them the new
00:17 - standard and new features such as shaded
00:20 - graph and visual effects graph are being
00:22 - built specifically for these templates
00:24 - which is kind of important so let's have
00:26 - a look at what these templates are while
00:28 - there's so much better than the old ones
00:30 - and most importantly answered the
00:31 - question which one should you choose but
00:34 - first this video is sponsored by Miller
00:36 - node Miller node is a free tool for
00:37 - organizing your creative projects into
00:39 - freeform visual boards it can be used
00:42 - for any creative project but it's
00:43 - particularly well suited to the early
00:45 - stages of game development I think we
00:47 - all know that that can get pretty messy
00:49 - they've recently updated their whole
00:51 - template workflow which makes Miller
00:52 - node extremely smooth to work with when
00:54 - planning a project also they just added
00:57 - dark mode we actually used Miller node
00:59 - in one of our videos when creating a
01:01 - turn-based battle system it was very
01:03 - convenient to pick up and make the
01:04 - planning process a lot smoother so if
01:06 - you want to have a look at Miller node
01:07 - in action definitely check out that
01:09 - video and find the millah node is free
01:11 - so get organized now by simply clicking
01:13 - the link in the description so which
01:16 - template should you choose well if
01:18 - you're creating a 2-d game use Universal
01:20 - start of the awesome patron supporters
01:22 - okay there might be a bit more to it
01:23 - than that but to answer this question
01:25 - properly we first have to look at what
01:27 - SRP is well the current default renderer
01:30 - also called the built-in renderer is a
01:31 - general-purpose renderer this means that
01:34 - it was made to fit as many types of use
01:36 - cases as possible however because it
01:38 - tries to do everything at once it can
01:40 - offer the best possible graphics
01:42 - features and it can be optimized for
01:44 - your particular needs to solve this
01:45 - problem
01:46 - unity build an entirely new rendering
01:48 - system SRP or the scriptable render
01:51 - pipeline SRP is unities new modular
01:53 - rendering system if your graphics
01:55 - engineer this means that you can
01:57 - customize the render loop in unity by a
01:58 - c-sharp scripts which is pretty advanced
02:01 - but for us mortals this just means that
02:03 - unity now has more graphics capabilities
02:05 - and that we get to choose exactly what
02:07 - type of graphics fit our game but
02:09 - creating your own render pipeline
02:11 - quickly becomes very
02:12 - programming heavy luckily unity has made
02:14 - to predefined pipelines that cover
02:16 - pretty much all of our needs and we can
02:18 - use them without getting too technical
02:19 - these to render pipelines focus on
02:22 - different aspects of graphical fidelity
02:23 - and therefore each one targets a
02:25 - specific set of use cases and these are
02:28 - of course the ones that we get to choose
02:29 - between when creating a new project the
02:31 - high definition render pipeline or HD RP
02:34 - and the universal render pipeline or you
02:36 - RP and fear not if you're already
02:41 - working on a project using the built-in
02:43 - renderer we'll have a link in the
02:44 - description to a guide that shows you
02:46 - how to port everything over to the new
02:47 - templates so now that we know what SRP
02:49 - is what render pipeline should you
02:51 - choose well let's start with HD RP HTTP
02:54 - targets only high-end hardware like PC
02:57 - Xbox and Playstation HTTP is meant for
02:59 - really high fidelity game's graphics
03:01 - demos architectural renders and pretty
03:04 - much anything that just requires the
03:05 - best possible graphics this is not to
03:07 - say that HTTP isn't performant it's
03:10 - still way faster than the built in
03:11 - renderer when targeting high-end
03:13 - graphics but if you're just making a low
03:15 - poly stylized game rendering everything
03:17 - with triple-a graphics techniques might
03:19 - be a bit overkill of course HTTP can
03:21 - create some amazingly beautiful scenes
03:23 - but it also requires so much more work
03:26 - to fully utilize all the power that HTTP
03:29 - has to offer you have to create dozens
03:31 - if not hundreds of texture Maps height
03:33 - maps metallic maps smoothness maps AO
03:35 - maps detail maps normal maps and so on
03:38 - the list goes on and this is for each of
03:41 - your materials so creating assets for
03:43 - each GOP can take a long time this means
03:45 - that the usual HTTP project requires a
03:48 - bigger team and therefore a much bigger
03:50 - budget in fact I would say that unless
03:52 - you're a graphics engineer if your team
03:53 - is smaller than 5 people HTTP probably
03:56 - isn't the right choice for you which of
03:57 - course leads us to you RP Europe is as
04:00 - the name suggests the go to render
04:02 - pipeline it's designed to run on any
04:04 - platform with grid performance so unless
04:07 - you have specific graphics needs that
04:09 - only HTTP or a custom render pipeline
04:11 - supports chances you're good to go with
04:13 - your P
04:14 - whether you're targeting mobile consoles
04:16 - web or PC Europeans just a great choice
04:19 - for performing rendering and at this
04:21 - point in time European does a lot it has
04:24 - many of the same features as a
04:25 - GOP but stripped down to make it more
04:28 - performant on all platforms this Arabic
04:30 - doesn't mean that you can create
04:31 - beautiful games with you RP on this
04:33 - channel we often talk about the
04:34 - difference between graphics and
04:36 - aesthetics graphics refers to the actual
04:38 - rendering while aesthetics refers to the
04:40 - art style and art direction and I would
04:42 - argue any day that aesthetics are so
04:45 - much more important to making a game
04:46 - look good than graphics in fact I think
04:49 - we see countless examples of games with
04:51 - a fairly low graphical quality which are
04:53 - still incredibly beautiful because of
04:55 - the great art choices that being said
04:57 - however it's good to know exactly what
04:59 - the different render pipelines have to
05:00 - offer so let's break it down so first of
05:07 - all shady graph and visual effects graph
05:08 - are now fully verified for both
05:10 - pipelines this is great because both are
05:14 - awesome tools for artists creating
05:16 - shaders or particle effects if you want
05:18 - to learn how to use them we of course
05:19 - have videos on both also if you're
05:21 - making a be art game this can actually
05:23 - be done with both pipelines
05:24 - however realistically we are with HDR P
05:27 - might get really performance heavy sense
05:29 - unity is essentially rendering
05:30 - everything twice one for each I deferred
05:33 - rendering though is currently only
05:34 - available in HD RP however it's
05:37 - currently in research phase on the you
05:38 - RP roadmap the same applies to decals
05:41 - which is a handy way of spicing up your
05:43 - levels by overlaying textures now one of
05:45 - the biggest differences between the two
05:47 - pipelines is lighting HTP offers way
05:50 - more advanced lighting features such as
05:52 - real-time global illumination which
05:54 - simulates bounce lighting volumetric
05:56 - lighting which simulates light passing
05:58 - through particles in the air and the big
06:00 - one ray tracing which is a whole new way
06:02 - of rendering light reflections and
06:03 - shadows ray tracing works by tracing the
06:06 - path of light as it bounces around your
06:08 - scene and simulates the way that light
06:09 - interacts with objects in real life this
06:12 - technique is definitely very performance
06:14 - heavy but it creates the most realistic
06:15 - results which is why it's been used by
06:17 - movie studios for ages to create
06:19 - pre-rendered images
06:21 - another thing that is very different
06:22 - though is shaders HTP offers high-end
06:25 - shader features like height detail and
06:28 - parallax maps which are used for
06:29 - displacement detail and simulation of
06:32 - depth in materials
06:33 - it also has subsurface scattering which
06:35 - simulates light passing through thin
06:36 - objects like cloth or ski
06:38 - and it features advanced shaders like
06:41 - these technically which allows you to
06:42 - use multiple material features like
06:44 - subsurface scattering iridescent and is
06:47 - and mr. anisotropy and as such a P and
06:52 - hazy parametrization at the same time
06:54 - when it comes to post-processing both
06:57 - render pipelines offer pretty much the
06:58 - same the most important things that you
07:00 - only get with HDR P are ambient
07:02 - occlusion which creates shadows in the
07:04 - places where two surfaces intersect auto
07:06 - exposure which simulates the humans eyes
07:08 - ability to adapt to different lighting
07:10 - conditions and screen space reflections
07:12 - which simulates reflections based on
07:14 - what's visible on the screen I should
07:16 - mention that ambient occlusion however
07:18 - is on its way to you R P but hdop
07:20 - doesn't get to have all the fun
07:22 - one thing that is only available in you
07:24 - RP is 2d lighting and shadows again if
07:27 - you're working in 2d you are P is the
07:28 - choice for you another cool feature that
07:30 - is now available in both pipelines is
07:33 - camera stacking this allows you to
07:35 - render from multiple cameras at once for
07:37 - example you can separate your
07:38 - environment FPS weapons and UI into
07:41 - different cameras which can have some
07:42 - cool benefits such as your hands and
07:45 - weapons not clipping through walls also
07:47 - physical cameras are available for both
07:49 - render pipelines as well I know there
07:51 - was a lot of information but I hope that
07:53 - you feel better equipped now to choose
07:55 - the right brand new pipeline for you
07:56 - we've created this table so that you can
07:58 - quickly get an overview of some of the
07:59 - main differences and that's pretty much
