00:00 - the most important thing when making a
00:01 - game is of course the actual content the
00:03 - gameplay the story the audio and the
00:06 - graphics but if you don't know how to
00:07 - present these things in a way that is
00:09 - interesting to the player they might
00:11 - find that they lose interest no matter
00:13 - how cool your game is and a key element
00:15 - when it comes to keeping players hooked
00:17 - is pacing so in this video we'll explore
00:20 - how you can use pacing to keep your
00:22 - players engaged but first this video is
00:24 - sponsored by Dennis pan Judah then this
00:26 - is an awesome game dev tutor who's just
00:28 - updated his super successful complete
00:30 - c-sharp master class this class will
00:32 - make you feel super comfortable writing
00:33 - code in c-sharp and using it for
00:35 - programming your own games in unity it
00:37 - will give you knowledge on many
00:38 - different aspects of c-sharp and teach
00:40 - topics such as databases link in WPF and
00:43 - much more at the end of the course you
00:45 - will even have made three games on your
00:47 - own if this sounds like something you're
00:49 - interested in simply click the link in
00:50 - the description to get started and get a
00:52 - massive discount so there are basically
00:54 - two parts to pacing in video games one
00:57 - is the typical narrative tension curve
00:59 - of the plot or how the story evolves
01:01 - throughout the game the other is the
01:04 - rhythm of the game play or how shifts in
01:07 - tempo and intensity affect the
01:09 - experience in terms of narrative many of
01:12 - the best stories can be plotted into
01:13 - graphs
01:14 - similar to this one with a steady rise
01:16 - and tension set up confrontation and
01:19 - then resolution an introduction to the
01:21 - world and the main character is followed
01:23 - by an establishment of the conflict
01:25 - leading to a climax resolving that
01:27 - conflict but it's actually not usually
01:30 - this simple instead of a constantly
01:32 - rising linear graph it's more like a
01:35 - fluctuating line with its own small
01:37 - attention curves along the surface the
01:39 - overall tension is still increasing up
01:41 - until the resolution but a great story
01:43 - has sub conflicts to resolve along the
01:45 - way
01:45 - imagine if Frodo just wandered into
01:48 - Mordor and threw the ring into the fiery
01:50 - depths of Mount Doom without any
01:52 - obstacles along his way pretty boring
01:55 - but when it comes to Story games usually
01:57 - have more in common with a TV series or
02:00 - a book just like games both of these
02:02 - media are constructed to keep the
02:04 - consumer engaged for as long as possible
02:06 - and not necessarily in one sitting
02:08 - unless of course you've bench watch an
02:10 - entire season of Game of Thrones in two
02:12 - days
02:13 - not that I've ever done that anyway many
02:16 - TV shows build their episodes around a
02:19 - template that looks like this
02:21 - they build tension and then totally ruin
02:23 - it all with commercial breaks however
02:25 - after the break we're still there the
02:28 - reason for this is the constant use of
02:30 - cliffhangers which is a concept that
02:32 - works just as well when applied to game
02:34 - design I'm not saying that this is
02:36 - always the best way to create a great
02:37 - tension curve cliffhangers can work but
02:39 - if they're overused they're bound to get
02:41 - predictive and annoying with delicate
02:44 - use however small intensity spikes in
02:46 - the narrative can be very effective at
02:48 - keeping the player engaged throughout
02:50 - the course of your game if used well
02:51 - it'll spice up the overall experience
02:53 - without getting obnoxious so definitely
02:56 - keep this in mind but narrative is one
02:59 - thing what about gameplay well when
03:02 - pacing your gameplay a very important
03:04 - factor is a rhythm rhythm the first two
03:07 - the balance between various gameplay
03:09 - types for example a game might have
03:11 - slower tempo sections like puzzles
03:13 - dialogue or exploration which make a
03:16 - nice contrast to higher tempo sections
03:18 - such as combat and racing it's important
03:21 - to alternate between different kinds of
03:23 - gameplay because playing through long
03:25 - stretches of slow gameplay becomes
03:27 - boring while getting challenged at high
03:28 - intensity for a long time becomes
03:30 - exhausting of course one of the tools at
03:32 - your disposal in terms of balancing more
03:35 - or less intense gameplay is difficulty
03:37 - in fact we just made a separate video on
03:39 - difficulty in video games so check that
03:41 - out in case you haven't seen it now
03:43 - half-life 2 you for example and valve
03:46 - games in general are great at
03:48 - controlling the rhythm throughout the
03:49 - game intense combat gameplay is often
03:52 - followed by calmer exploration or puzzle
03:54 - elements never sticking to the same type
03:56 - of gameplay for too long for example in
03:59 - chapter 3 of half-life 2 Gordon the main
04:02 - character obtains his first weapon and
04:04 - really puts it to use as he fights
04:06 - through the canals in this fairly combat
04:08 - heavy section the players fighting
04:10 - skills are put to the test for the first
04:12 - time Gordon walks through thin and
04:14 - claustrophobic corridors with combines
04:16 - manhacks zombies and aliens lurking
04:19 - around every corner which makes the
04:20 - whole section quite tense the next part
04:23 - though is a slow-paced roaming and extra
04:26 - section with occasional puzzles the
04:28 - world is no longer a bunch of
04:29 - claustrophobic corridors but instead a
04:32 - big open area and all you have to do is
04:34 - just Cruise in your airboat and take in
04:37 - the view this is a huge contrast from
04:39 - before both in terms of pacing and
04:41 - scenery which serves as a great
04:43 - breathing room before the action rises
04:46 - once again so the half-life franchise
04:48 - really nails tension and release which
04:51 - is why the games are often very hard to
04:53 - put down
04:54 - but pacing narrative and gameplay aren't
04:56 - the only things that go into keeping
04:58 - players engaged just as important is
05:00 - creating a sense of progression
05:02 - progression is strongly related to what
05:04 - is referred to as the reward schedule in
05:07 - other words we want to think about how
05:09 - and when we reward the player to give
05:10 - them a sense of achievement and make
05:12 - them feel they've really earned the
05:13 - progression they've made keep in mind
05:15 - that rewards in this sense doesn't just
05:18 - mean big loot drops or new abilities a
05:20 - reward could also be a progression in
05:22 - the story or getting to visit a new
05:24 - level and here timing is key giving too
05:31 - few rewards or spacing them out too much
05:33 - candy moralize the player and they may
05:35 - start to feel like they aren't
05:37 - progressing on the other hand giving the
05:39 - player too many rewards or rewarding
05:41 - trivial tasks will lessen the impact of
05:43 - each and diminish this sense of
05:45 - achievement striking the perfect balance
05:47 - in the reward schedule is not easy and
05:50 - in the end it's all about psychology and
05:52 - how the brain gets affected when playing
05:54 - the game I think we've all had
05:56 - experience with games particularly in
05:58 - the casual mobile market that I designed
06:01 - primarily to be addictive without much
06:03 - thought to the content of the game
06:05 - itself these games might be extremely
06:07 - good at keeping players hooked but I
06:09 - think it's a shame that many developers
06:10 - are stuck trying to optimize retention
06:12 - instead of getting to utilize their
06:14 - skills to create meaningful experiences
06:16 - that's set thinking about how you pace
06:18 - your rewards is important for almost any
06:21 - game and you should also think about not
06:22 - holding back on rewards that are
06:24 - important to the way your game plays
06:26 - again half-life 2 is a great example
06:28 - valve initially planned the gravity gun
06:31 - to be used only in the last sections of
06:33 - the game but found that players had so
06:35 - much fun with the mechanic that they
06:36 - decided to give the gun to players much
06:38 - earlier
06:39 - even though it meant they had to go back
06:40 - and restructure a bunch of their levels
06:42 - now another great way of keeping players
06:45 - engaged is with anticipation
06:47 - this means presenting the player with
06:49 - something that they are unable to obtain
06:51 - yet this can go hand in hand with
06:54 - rewards say if you disclose to the
06:55 - player that at a certain amount of XP
06:57 - something cool will be unlocked this
06:59 - happens every time you glance at the
07:01 - skill list in RPG games such as horizon
07:03 - zero dawn or when you start thinking up
07:05 - the perfect combination of skills and
07:06 - items in games like path of Exile
07:08 - fantasizing about rewards long before
07:10 - they are available essentially prolongs
07:12 - the time in which the player is enjoying
07:14 - them and it also gives the player
07:15 - achievable goals which can offer
07:17 - incentive to keep playing I have spent
07:20 - countless hours in Excel or external
07:22 - build and planning tools thinking up the
07:24 - most crazy builds for characters in
07:26 - games 8 imply that ignites himself in
07:29 - order to damage enemies around him in
07:31 - path of Exile or an agent that
07:32 - specializes in tech to heal his allies
07:35 - in the division 2 games like these have
07:37 - been on my mind for hours even while not
07:40 - playing of course creating custom builds
07:42 - like this might be a bit too daunting or
07:44 - nerdy for most players but giving the
07:47 - players some sort of in-game goal is
07:49 - always a great motivator
07:50 - now sometimes anticipation can be set up
07:53 - more like a mystery something that
07:55 - intrigues the player but without them
07:58 - knowing exactly what is to come I think
08:00 - a good example of this is the Dark
08:02 - Portal in World of Warcraft here players
08:04 - are limited to explore the main world of
08:06 - Azeroth for almost 60 levels during this
08:09 - entire time
08:10 - every time they open their map they can
08:12 - see another world called Outland but the
08:15 - actual contents of the world is greyed
08:17 - out only when they reach level 58 two
08:20 - players get to enter the dark portal and
08:22 - they immediately transported to a huge
08:24 - new area that they get to explore in
08:27 - fact Blizzard uses this extensively
08:29 - involved of Warcraft and the same
08:31 - applies to each of their higher level
08:33 - sounds the trick to making this work is
08:35 - setting up a scenario that seems
08:37 - intriguing the curiosity drives the
08:39 - player to keep playing because they just
08:41 - have to discover something new and
08:43 - unravel the mystery
08:46 - me congratulations was it worth it of
08:49 - course a huge dark portal definitely
08:51 - helps with this and we actually see this
08:53 - a lot in the Lego games as well during
08:55 - the main campaign of Lego Star Wars for
08:58 - example you'll encounter areas that you
09:00 - cannot yet reach however later in the
09:02 - game you unlock new characters that have
09:04 - the ability to open specific doors or
09:06 - jump higher in order to reach those
09:07 - areas that were previously unavailable
09:09 - but some games handle engagement and
09:13 - anticipation in a completely different
09:15 - way in Minecraft there's no specified
09:18 - in-game goal or there wasn't before the
09:21 - ender dragon was introduced but
09:23 - minecraft was compelling long before
09:25 - this and still is today in fact many
09:28 - people still haven't completed the game
09:30 - and they don't really care too much
09:32 - about finishing so what makes minecraft
09:35 - so engaging to just play well you might
09:38 - think that a game like minecraft has no
09:40 - real progression and therefore no
09:42 - opportunity for the developer to control
09:44 - the pacing but not the creative
09:46 - minecraft has crafted
09:48 - a world where the player is free to
09:50 - fabricate their own story and their own
09:52 - progression many players first goal is
09:55 - to survive the night
09:56 - but from here the sky's the limit some
09:59 - players goal might be to build a
10:00 - beautiful house while others choose to
10:03 - spend time creating the most optimal
10:04 - system to craft and handle resources and
10:07 - if they get bored of the current
10:08 - gameplay loop the player can just change
10:10 - up the gameplay themselves had enough of
10:12 - mining let's go hunting for some food so
10:15 - this structure and presentation of a
10:17 - game is just as important as the content
10:19 - itself turns out they go hand in hand
10:22 - you can create a game with great combat
10:24 - mind-boggling puzzles and snappy
10:26 - controls and it will feel great for a
10:29 - while but with poor structure and
10:31 - presentation it will never really shine
10:33 - so hopefully this video has given you
10:36 - some good ideas on how to paste
10:37 - narrative and gameplay in a way that is
10:39 - interesting to the player if you enjoyed

Cleaned transcript:

the most important thing when making a game is of course the actual content the gameplay the story the audio and the graphics but if you don't know how to present these things in a way that is interesting to the player they might find that they lose interest no matter how cool your game is and a key element when it comes to keeping players hooked is pacing so in this video we'll explore how you can use pacing to keep your players engaged but first this video is sponsored by Dennis pan Judah then this is an awesome game dev tutor who's just updated his super successful complete csharp master class this class will make you feel super comfortable writing code in csharp and using it for programming your own games in unity it will give you knowledge on many different aspects of csharp and teach topics such as databases link in WPF and much more at the end of the course you will even have made three games on your own if this sounds like something you're interested in simply click the link in the description to get started and get a massive discount so there are basically two parts to pacing in video games one is the typical narrative tension curve of the plot or how the story evolves throughout the game the other is the rhythm of the game play or how shifts in tempo and intensity affect the experience in terms of narrative many of the best stories can be plotted into graphs similar to this one with a steady rise and tension set up confrontation and then resolution an introduction to the world and the main character is followed by an establishment of the conflict leading to a climax resolving that conflict but it's actually not usually this simple instead of a constantly rising linear graph it's more like a fluctuating line with its own small attention curves along the surface the overall tension is still increasing up until the resolution but a great story has sub conflicts to resolve along the way imagine if Frodo just wandered into Mordor and threw the ring into the fiery depths of Mount Doom without any obstacles along his way pretty boring but when it comes to Story games usually have more in common with a TV series or a book just like games both of these media are constructed to keep the consumer engaged for as long as possible and not necessarily in one sitting unless of course you've bench watch an entire season of Game of Thrones in two

the break we're still there the reason for this is the constant use of cliffhangers which is a concept that works just as well when applied to game design I'm not saying that this is always the best way to create a great tension curve cliffhangers can work but if they're overused they're bound to get predictive and annoying with delicate use however small intensity spikes in the narrative can be very effective at keeping the player engaged throughout the course of your game if used well it'll spice up the overall experience without getting obnoxious so definitely keep this in mind but narrative is one thing what about gameplay well when pacing your gameplay a very important factor is a rhythm rhythm the first two the balance between various gameplay types for example a game might have slower tempo sections like puzzles dialogue or exploration which make a nice contrast to higher tempo sections such as combat and racing it's important to alternate between different kinds of gameplay because playing through long stretches of slow gameplay becomes boring while getting challenged at high intensity for a long time becomes exhausting of course one of the tools at your disposal in terms of balancing more or less intense gameplay is difficulty in fact we just made a separate video on difficulty in video games so check that out in case you haven't seen it now halflife
