00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to this
00:05 - introduction video to the all new unity
00:08 - GUI system so it's finally out unity
00:12 - four point six has been released as a
00:14 - public beta and is now available for
00:17 - download it's it's pretty amazing these
00:20 - tools have been expected for so so long
00:23 - it's basically become the developers
00:26 - equivalent to half-life 3 at this point
00:28 - so that's super house awesome that we
00:32 - can finally get to play around with
00:34 - these tools so to download this please
00:37 - go to unity 3d comm slash unity slash
00:40 - beta slash 4.6 and you can download it
00:43 - here please remember that this is a beta
00:46 - and there might be some bugs here and
00:49 - there cool I've also gone ahead and went
00:52 - over to the break ease forum and created
00:55 - a GUI system section under the answers
00:59 - section where you can post questions
01:02 - about the unity GUI and there's plenty
01:05 - of people here ready to help you should
01:07 - you get stuck so go to forums our break
01:09 - is to come and visit the GUI section you
01:12 - can also highlight your stuff if you
01:14 - make something cool or just generally
01:17 - discuss the new GUI system so today
01:20 - we're going to be creating a very simple
01:22 - menu like the one you see here you can
01:25 - see that I have some buttons set up they
01:28 - don't do anything when you press them I
01:30 - just want to give you an idea of how you
01:33 - work with the GUI in unity and how some
01:36 - of the different elements can be put
01:39 - together so we have a toggle and a
01:41 - slider three buttons and a input field
01:45 - where you can type stuff cool so let's
01:50 - go ahead and dig right into today's
01:52 - subject and start creating the GUI of
01:54 - today so let's delete the canvas and the
01:57 - event system here which I've just graded
01:59 - and let's start from fresh so you can
02:02 - see that I have a basic scene setup here
02:04 - just a main camera with a skybox a Sun
02:07 - with a particle system and that's
02:09 - basically it so that's not much to it
02:14 - so we can just go ahead and start
02:16 - building the UI now so in the hierarchy
02:19 - right-click your mouse cursor and go on
02:22 - the UI and select button and you can see
02:25 - that it automatically creates three
02:27 - things actually four it creates a canvas
02:30 - which is basically the screen it
02:36 - emulates the screen on our screen size
02:39 - so it's basically just the restrictions
02:42 - of our GUI everything in our GUI needs
02:44 - to be inside of the canvas here then it
02:47 - creates a button which also has a child
02:51 - which is the text of the button and it
02:54 - also creates an event system that you
02:57 - should just leave as soon as it's pretty
02:59 - important that you leave it here so if
03:02 - we go ahead and double click on the
03:04 - canvas
03:04 - we will send assume in on it and then
03:08 - over here in the right hand corner we
03:10 - can go ahead and select to view it from
03:13 - the front here so just make sure that
03:15 - you view it directly from the front or
03:19 - you could quickly get annoyed you could
03:21 - go into 2d mode to make things even
03:24 - easier I'm going to do that because then
03:27 - we also have the grid cool so what we're
03:31 - going to do is we're going to select the
03:32 - button and make sure that we have the
03:34 - new 2d control selected in the left hand
03:37 - corner it's going to be really annoying
03:39 - rotating and scaling this then we can
03:42 - just go ahead and maybe size this up
03:45 - just drag the right-hand corner hold
03:47 - down alt to scale on both axes and then
03:50 - shift to scale about preserving the
03:53 - aspect ratio just to make this a bit
03:56 - better a bit bigger then select the text
04:00 - here and we're going to maybe say play
04:05 - game we're going to bump up the font
04:09 - size a bit and yeah I think that's
04:13 - pretty much all we need to do with the
04:15 - text then we can go back and select the
04:17 - button and we can maybe color this so
04:20 - let's make it a reddish color
04:25 - groups like this maybe bump up the
04:30 - alphabet that doesn't look too bad I
04:35 - just wanted to look kind of action like
04:37 - if this was like a space shooter or
04:41 - something and also for the text let's go
04:44 - ahead and make this white and now we can
04:48 - just position this a bit to the right
04:50 - here go into the game view and see how
04:53 - it actually looks that wasn't too bad
04:56 - you can always adjust the position X&Y
04:59 - from the game view here to really adjust
05:03 - it the way you want it to something like
05:06 - there it looks pretty great and what you
05:08 - might notice is that the play game and
05:11 - the GUI element here looks just the
05:14 - tiniest bit blurred and the reason why
05:17 - is we need to go into the canvas here
05:19 - and select what is called pixel perfect
05:21 - and this will move the elements just a
05:24 - bit to make them are actually well pixel
05:29 - perfect it will make them look a bit
05:31 - crisper and a bit sharper so now it
05:34 - looks better and we can go ahead and
05:36 - create some sub buttons here so let's
05:39 - just call this one D play button let's
05:43 - select it and press control D let's then
05:46 - move this down and then scale it a bit
05:50 - to the left now we can duplicate this
05:54 - again and move it to the right so now we
05:57 - have two of these sub buttons here these
06:00 - smaller buttons the first one we're
06:03 - going to rename to load button and then
06:08 - we're going to do a Save button also
06:13 - here and let's dig into these and change
06:18 - the text so this is going to be load I'm
06:23 - going to do capital letters and then
06:26 - this Save button here's of course going
06:28 - to say save then we can go ahead and
06:32 - select both of them and change the color
06:34 - to something a bit more neutral like the
06:38 - great here so that looks pretty decent
06:42 - now we can go ahead and actually let's
06:45 - just bring down the L found these just a
06:47 - bit to make them less puppy cool and
06:53 - then we can go ahead and create another
06:55 - UI element so right-click on the canvas
06:58 - go under UI and select the let's do the
07:02 - toggle here so now we can move this over
07:04 - and position it so that the toggle
07:10 - itself here the marker is just aligned
07:14 - with the buttons
07:15 - I notice that unity now has some very
07:18 - fine snapping tools with the GUI which
07:22 - are very nice so let's rename this to
07:26 - music toggle let's drop down this menu
07:31 - drop down the background and select the
07:33 - label here let's call this music and
07:37 - let's go ahead and make this white and
07:43 - let's also select the whole music toggle
07:47 - here and just scale it a bit to the left
07:50 - because we are now going to add one more
07:52 - element which is the slider and we can
07:56 - just drag this over and just align it
08:00 - completely with the toggle drag this
08:03 - over to scale it to line up with the
08:06 - buttons here and yeah I think that's
08:11 - pretty good we can go ahead and see how
08:13 - that looks in game that looks pretty
08:15 - nice you can also scale this up should
08:17 - you want it to be little wider that
08:20 - might be good maybe bit less wide
08:24 - something like there it's pretty good
08:27 - and now we basically have a three
08:30 - buttons a music toggle and a volume
08:34 - slider and that was just in a couple of
08:38 - minutes so you can see just how
08:40 - effective it is to set up basic you eyes
08:43 - using this system
08:45 - now let's rename the slider to volume
08:49 - slider and let's also make a fine
08:52 - the element which is going to be under
08:54 - UI and it's the input field so let's
08:57 - just drag this oops drag this over
09:00 - Center it on our UI that's centered and
09:04 - then hold down shift or only move it on
09:07 - one axis and we can go ahead and change
09:10 - the background because I don't really
09:12 - like this one too just the ordinary
09:14 - background then we can maybe change the
09:19 - color to match the color up here and
09:22 - while we do that I just want to show you
09:24 - something cool with colors if you go
09:26 - under the color on the play game button
09:28 - you can see that we can add a preset so
09:31 - just click here to add a new preset and
09:33 - now it's saved there so when we hit
09:35 - under the input field and select the
09:38 - color here you'll simply click then it
09:40 - will now have the exact same color and
09:43 - alpha settings as the play game button
09:45 - now we can head under this and select
09:48 - the text let's make this white you will
09:52 - notice that the active text color here
09:55 - is also white so you will have to change
09:58 - them both this is the default one and
10:00 - this is the one whenever we are actually
10:03 - typing something then the selection
10:05 - color that's going to make that white
10:07 - also because the blue one doesn't really
10:09 - fit with our color scheme now when we go
10:13 - ahead and hit play we've actually
10:15 - constructed the full UI that I showed
10:18 - you in just a matter of minutes I mean
10:22 - it's it's that quick so thanks for
10:25 - watching this tutorial i hope that you
10:28 - want to see more on the unity GUI and
10:30 - that you are as excited about this as I
10:33 - am so thanks again for watching and I'll
10:36 - see you in the next video

drag this over to scale it to line up with the buttons here and yeah I think that's pretty good we can go ahead and see how that looks in game that looks pretty nice you can also scale this up should you want it to be little wider that might be good maybe bit less wide something like there it's pretty good and now we basically have a three buttons a music toggle and a volume slider and that was just in a couple of minutes so you can see just how effective it is to set up basic you eyes using this system now let's rename the slider to volume slider and let's also make a fine the element which is going to be under UI and it's the input field so let's just drag this oops drag this over Center it on our UI that's centered and then hold down shift or only move it on one axis and we can go
