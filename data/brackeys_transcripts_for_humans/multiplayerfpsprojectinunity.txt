With timestamps:

00:00 - so you need to just released their new
00:01 - huge demo project and it's called the
00:03 - FPS sample project it's a vertical slice
00:06 - of a triple a quality multiplayer FPS
00:08 - which is designed to give an insight
00:10 - into how a fairly small team of six
00:12 - people can create high-end Network games
00:15 - using unity the entire project is
00:17 - available for download right now and
00:19 - it's pretty big it's got one complete
00:21 - devil to rig characters for weapons
00:23 - deathmatch and assault game modes and
00:26 - also what is this nobody in all
00:29 - seriousness the graphics for this game
00:30 - are absolutely amazing so why put this
00:33 - thing but really crosshairs aside it's a
00:36 - really cool project also we have an
00:38 - announcement so for a long time now
00:39 - we've been getting a lot of requests to
00:41 - do one particular thing and after a lot
00:44 - of waiting it's finally here we have
00:47 - practice merge yeah we have practice
00:58 - merge guys but in fact we're not only
01:00 - making break is merge we're launching a
01:02 - full-featured store for all kinds of
01:05 - game dev related clothing it's called
01:06 - line of code and it's live now at line
01:08 - of code that I oh and of course it has a
01:10 - dark mode we currently have two designs
01:13 - on there one is of course deep break is
01:15 - loco and the other one is a cool custom
01:17 - design made by our amazing artist Thea
01:19 - full of you game drivers out there so
01:22 - far we're just testing this thing out
01:23 - everything is of course super early but
01:25 - we're definitely planning to add more
01:26 - designs as we go so stay tuned for that
01:29 - because the stores completely new we're
01:30 - having an opening sale so I can get
01:32 - everything at a discount we just feel
01:34 - like something like this has been
01:35 - lacking and we're hoping you guys will
01:37 - like it as much as we do that's of
01:39 - course a link in the description to
01:40 - where you can check it out now I believe
01:42 - that the assemble project is made using
01:43 - a bunch of custom netcode I'm not
01:45 - entirely sure if there's some unit in
01:47 - there as well
01:48 - unity hasn't really been too clear about
01:50 - this but I do know that it's built on an
01:51 - authoritative server architecture for
01:54 - the characters we have this cool robot
01:55 - who has a minigun and a grenade launcher
01:57 - and tracer has received a helmet as well
02:00 - as a machine gun and rocket launcher
02:02 - also a really cool thing about this
02:03 - project is that it's under continuous
02:05 - development unity isn't just dropping it
02:07 - and then leaving it instead the team
02:09 - behind the project is planning to update
02:11 - it and add more features as we go so
02:13 - enough talking about the project how do
02:15 - you actually start using it well let's
02:17 - go through it step by step so the first
02:19 - thing we need to do is go to the FPS
02:21 - sample on github and from here we need
02:23 - to clone the project if you've never
02:25 - cloned a project of github before I'll
02:27 - make sure to have a link in the
02:28 - description to where you can learn how
02:29 - to do that also since some of the files
02:31 - in this project are so large you need to
02:33 - use get large file support or LFS if you
02:37 - don't already have this installed make
02:38 - sure to follow this link to download it
02:40 - once you've cloned the project to your
02:42 - computer you need to go and check here
02:44 - to see what unity version you will need
02:45 - to download currently this supports 2018
02:48 - point 3 beta 6 so I've gone ahead and
02:50 - downloaded this unity version and from
02:52 - there you can open up the project in
02:54 - unity this is going to take quite a
02:56 - while the first time now there's a few
02:57 - setup steps that we need to do in order
02:59 - to make our project run properly and the
03:01 - first one is actually because a bug in
03:03 - the 2000 18.3 beta if you're using later
03:06 - versions you can maybe skip this step
03:07 - but for now we actually need to go ahead
03:09 - and re import a bunch of assets so let's
03:12 - go in here and search for all prefabs by
03:14 - going T and then colon prefab that's
03:16 - like the first one scroll to the bottom
03:18 - select all them right click and hit
03:20 - re-import and again this might take some
03:23 - time then once that's done we need to do
03:25 - the same thing for models so we'll
03:26 - search for T colon models and let's go
03:30 - to the top let's take the first one go
03:31 - to the bottom shift select the last one
03:33 - right click and again re import' and
03:36 - this is probably gonna take even longer
03:38 - and that should be it for setup we're
03:41 - now going to fps sample windows and open
03:43 - up the project tools and this is going
03:46 - to be the main window for opening
03:47 - different scenes and running the game
03:49 - let's go ahead and dock it over here by
03:51 - the inspector and as you can see there
03:53 - are a few different levels in here level
03:55 - one is the main level that you've seen
03:57 - some footage of level menu is of course
03:59 - the main menu from American create and
04:02 - find games and level 0 is what we refer
04:04 - to as a white box level this is
04:06 - basically a much smaller level that is
04:08 - made up of placeholder assets so that
04:10 - it's much easier to run and play testing
04:13 - let's go ahead and open up that now by
04:15 - pressing the Open button here and it's
04:17 - then gonna load in all the assets and
04:18 - open up all the scenes that make up this
04:20 - level and when the level is loaded it
04:22 - might look really weird like this I
04:25 - found that for some reason in the scene
04:26 - view you
04:27 - to enable post-processing up here in
04:30 - order for it to actually show and for me
04:32 - the first time that I did this the scene
04:34 - actually just changed from white to
04:36 - black the solution to this was pretty
04:38 - simple I simply hit play in order to try
04:41 - and run the game in preview mode and
04:42 - after a bit of waiting this should take
04:44 - us into play mode where we can now run
04:46 - through and actually play the game and
04:48 - as you can see it works with shooting we
04:50 - have movement in here that is double
04:53 - jumping we even have this cool rocket
04:54 - launcher and yet the game is working
04:56 - just fine so if we go to the top here
04:59 - and stop playing you can see how we can
05:00 - pretty easily go in and configure
05:02 - different parts of our scene here say we
05:05 - wanted to move around this prop here we
05:07 - would simply do so and we can hit play
05:09 - and preview our changes in a project
05:11 - panel there are also a bunch of prefabs
05:14 - these are split into different
05:16 - categories like cameras characters
05:18 - environment gameplay and so forth we
05:20 - could for example go under characters
05:22 - then go under our terraformer and in
05:24 - here we actually have a scriptable
05:25 - object where if we look in the inspector
05:28 - we can configure different things about
05:30 - this character in fact we can also open
05:32 - up any of these prefabs and edit them or
05:34 - we could go on to say the grenade here
05:36 - and double-click on the robot grenade to
05:39 - open it up in the prefab manager and in
05:41 - here we have different settings such as
05:42 - the gravity as well as the damage that
05:44 - our grenade will inflict so to configure
05:47 - the game I really recommend you play
05:48 - around with the environment itself
05:50 - inside the scene view and go under the
05:52 - prefabs folder in the project in order
05:54 - to change settings I think you'll learn
05:56 - a lot from just playing around with it
05:58 - of course we can also go to project
06:00 - tools and open up our level 1 here so
06:02 - that's it open and I'm not gonna save
06:04 - any of my changes here and again this
06:06 - will probably take a little while and
06:08 - we're now inside of the main level we
06:10 - can go ahead and stay coming camera here
06:12 - and hit F to focus on it and this might
06:14 - make your computer lag a bit since we're
06:15 - loading in a bunch of assets and you can
06:17 - see how many gizmos are actually drawing
06:19 - here let's go to the FPS sample it's
06:22 - gone to hotkeys and let's hit toggle
06:24 - gizmos assembly press ctrl-g and I found
06:26 - that I actually needed to do this twice
06:28 - there we go so now I've seen looks much
06:30 - cleaner and you can see already that my
06:32 - FPS has certainly been improved quite a
06:34 - bit so this is what the main level looks
06:36 - like inside of the editor and just like
06:38 - with level 0 we can go ahead
06:40 - preview it by simply hitting play but
06:42 - since this is a multiplayer game it
06:44 - would make more sense if we could build
06:46 - two versions of the game and see them
06:47 - running side by side to do this we need
06:50 - to make sure to first build our asset
06:51 - bundles and we can do this using the
06:53 - project tools let's go to the right here
06:55 - and hit all and this is another one of
06:57 - those where you'll probably have to wait
06:58 - a bit and once that's done we can go
07:03 - ahead and build the game so now all the
07:07 - files necessary in order to run our game
07:09 - should be created we've set up our
07:10 - project we've created the asset bundles
07:12 - we've built the game and don't worry
07:14 - when you do this in the future it's
07:15 - gonna be much much faster but what we're
07:18 - now able to do is use this QuickStart
07:19 - down here in order to quickly boot up
07:21 - clients and test out the game as you can
07:24 - see we can choose what mode whether we
07:25 - want to play multiplayer single-player
07:27 - we choose what level we want to start
07:29 - how many clients we want to open up in
07:31 - my case I'm just gonna open to test
07:32 - clients as well as a server so if we
07:35 - press the green start button here it's
07:37 - actually quickly going to open up two
07:39 - windows and I'm just gonna resize these
07:41 - to fit these better on screen and as you
07:43 - can see both of these are actually
07:44 - running the game and each player has
07:47 - spawned in a separate location with a
07:49 - different character you will also see
07:51 - that it opens a third window this is a
07:53 - console window and this is actually just
07:55 - a very very very tiny version of the
07:57 - game without any assets in it that is
07:59 - running the server so now we can go in
08:01 - and play around in any of these builds
08:04 - and we should actually be able to meet
08:06 - each other in-game and there we go we
08:10 - can now see the two characters working
08:11 - together in multiplayer we can damage
08:14 - each other shoot them with different
08:15 - guns and there's even a scoreboard that
08:18 - we can bring up to always see what the
08:20 - score is pretty cool and one of the
08:23 - really cool things we can do when
08:24 - playing around with the game and testing
08:26 - is using the console so if we press f1
08:30 - here it's gonna bring up the console
08:31 - window and in here we can type different
08:33 - commands if you're unsure about what
08:35 - commands you have at your disposal you
08:36 - can always type help and get a list of
08:38 - them for example we could force a
08:40 - respawn here by typing in respawn or we
08:43 - could shift to third-person mode by
08:44 - typing in third-person and you can see
08:47 - this client is now running in third
08:48 - person and the game is still fully
08:50 - playable I'll have a link in the
08:52 - description for a more detailed list for
08:54 - the different console commands now to
08:56 - shut down the game again we can go back
08:58 - to the unity editor and hit stop all and
09:00 - it's gonna close all of the running
09:02 - instances of the game and just like with
09:04 - our white box scene we can go in and
09:06 - move and change objects in this level
09:09 - and any changes we made inside our
09:11 - project window such as two prefabs or
09:13 - scriptable objects are of course going
09:15 - to carry over between levels remember
09:17 - that every time you make a change to a
09:18 - level you need to rebuild the levels
09:20 - asset bundles and every time you make a
09:22 - change to an asset such as a prefab we
09:25 - need to rebuild the assets if you add
09:27 - any new objects you need to press the
09:29 - update register button and of course if
09:30 - you're in doubt you can always press all
09:32 - of course the final scene that we need
09:33 - to check out is the menu so let's go
09:35 - ahead and open that up I'm not gonna
09:36 - save any of these changes and this is
09:38 - going to load much quicker both because
09:40 - it's a much smaller level but also
09:41 - because unity is now starting to cache a
09:43 - lot of these things behind the scenes if
09:46 - we just try and play this inside of the
09:48 - editor we can see that it's a fully
09:50 - working menu with a nice intro animation
09:52 - and from here we can create games and
09:54 - joint games and we can even configure
09:56 - settings under options awesome of course
09:59 - they are so much here that we haven't
10:01 - shown this is just scratching the
10:03 - surface of how to start working with the
10:04 - project I really recommend you look
10:06 - through the entire project folder and
10:08 - have a look at what scripts are there
10:09 - what assets make up the project and all
10:12 - the different prefabs that you can
10:13 - configure and also there are so many
10:15 - custom tools built for this project to
10:17 - make your life easier of course you can
10:19 - find all these under FPS sample and
10:21 - they've been nicely grouped into
10:22 - different categories so from here it's
10:24 - really up to you to play around with it
10:26 - and have fun that's pretty much it for

Cleaned transcript:

so you need to just released their new huge demo project and it's called the FPS sample project it's a vertical slice of a triple a quality multiplayer FPS which is designed to give an insight into how a fairly small team of six people can create highend Network games using unity the entire project is available for download right now and it's pretty big it's got one complete devil to rig characters for weapons deathmatch and assault game modes and also what is this nobody in all seriousness the graphics for this game are absolutely amazing so why put this thing but really crosshairs aside it's a really cool project also we have an announcement so for a long time now we've been getting a lot of requests to do one particular thing and after a lot of waiting it's finally here we have practice merge yeah we have practice merge guys but in fact we're not only making break is merge we're launching a fullfeatured store for all kinds of game dev related clothing it's called line of code and it's live now at line of code that I oh and of course it has a dark mode we currently have two designs on there one is of course deep break is loco and the other one is a cool custom design made by our amazing artist Thea full of you game drivers out there so far we're just testing this thing out everything is of course super early but we're definitely planning to add more designs as we go so stay tuned for that because the stores completely new we're having an opening sale so I can get everything at a discount we just feel like something like this has been lacking and we're hoping you guys will like it as much as we do that's of course a link in the description to where you can check it out now I believe that the assemble project is made using a bunch of custom netcode I'm not entirely sure if there's some unit in there as well unity hasn't really been too clear about this but I do know that it's built on an authoritative server architecture for the characters we have this cool robot who has a minigun and a grenade launcher and tracer has received a helmet as well as a machine gun and rocket launcher also a really cool thing about this project is that it's under continuous development unity isn't just dropping it and then leaving it instead the team behind the project is planning to update it and add more features as we go so enough talking about the project how do you actually start using it well let's go through it step by step so the first thing we need to do is go to the FPS sample on github and from here we need to clone the project if you've never cloned a project of github before I'll make sure to have a link in the description to where you can learn how to do that also since some of the files in this project are so large you need to use get large file support or LFS if you don't already have this installed make sure to follow this link to download it once you've cloned the project to your computer you need to go and check here to see what unity version you will need to download currently this supports 2018 point 3 beta 6 so I've gone ahead and downloaded this unity version and from there you can open up the project in unity this is going to take quite a while the first time now there's a few setup steps that we need to do in order to make our project run properly and the first one is actually because a bug in the 2000 18.3 beta if you're using later versions you can maybe skip this step but for now we actually need to go ahead and re import a bunch of assets so let's go in here and search for all prefabs by going T and then colon prefab that's like the first one scroll to the bottom select all them right click and hit reimport and again this might take some time then once that's done we need to do the same thing for models so we'll search for T colon models and let's go to the top let's take the first one go to the bottom shift select the last one right click and again re import' and this is probably gonna take even longer and that should be it for setup we're now going to fps sample windows and open up the project tools and this is going to be the main window for opening different scenes and running the game let's go ahead and dock it over here by the inspector and as you can see there are a few different levels in here level one is the main level that you've seen some footage of level menu is of course the main menu from American create and find games and level 0 is what we refer to as a white box level this is basically a much smaller level that is made up of placeholder assets so that it's much easier to run and play testing let's go ahead and open up that now by pressing the Open button here and it's then gonna load in all the assets and open up all the scenes that make up this level and when the level is loaded it might look really weird like this I found that for some reason in the scene view you to enable postprocessing up here in order for it to actually show and for me the first time that I did this the scene actually just changed from white to black the solution to this was pretty simple I simply hit play in order to try and run the game in preview mode and after a bit

always type help and get a list of them for example we could force a respawn here by typing in respawn or we could shift to thirdperson mode by typing in thirdperson and you can see this client is now running in third person and the game is still fully playable I'll have a link in the description for a more detailed list for the different console commands now to shut down the game again we can go back to the unity editor and hit stop all and it's gonna close all of the running instances of the game and just like with our white box scene we can go in and move and change objects in this level and any changes we made inside our project window such as two prefabs or scriptable objects are of course going to carry over between levels remember that every time you make a change to a level you need to rebuild the levels asset bundles and every time you make a change to an asset such as a prefab we need to rebuild the assets if you add any new objects you need to press the update register button and of course if you're in doubt you can always press all of course the final scene that we need to check out is the menu so let's go ahead and open that up I'm not gonna save any of these changes and this is going to load much quicker both because it's a much smaller level but also because unity is now starting to cache a lot of these things behind the scenes if we just try and play this inside of the editor we can see that it's a fully working menu with a nice intro animation and from here we can create games and joint games and we can even configure settings under options awesome of course they are so much here that we haven't shown this is just scratching the surface of how to start working with the project I really recommend you look through the entire project folder and have a look at what scripts are there what assets make up the project and all the different prefabs that you can configure and also there are so many custom tools built for this project to make your life easier of course you can find all these under FPS sample and they've been nicely grouped into different categories so from here it's really up to you to play around with it and have fun
