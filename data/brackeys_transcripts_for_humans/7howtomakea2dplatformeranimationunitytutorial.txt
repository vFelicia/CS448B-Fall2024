00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - video number seven in the how to make a
00:07 - 2d platformer course today we're going
00:10 - to finally be adding some character
00:12 - animations uh by utilizing the scripts
00:15 - from the standard assets that's already
00:17 - sits on our player and setting up an
00:19 - animated controller that fits with that
00:22 - script so let's just di right into it
00:25 - today uh no long intros as always I've
00:28 - opened up Unity
00:30 - and you can see when we get in here and
00:32 - hit play that our character simply only
00:35 - flips and and doesn't really animate at
00:37 - all so if we select our player you can
00:41 - see that we have disabled the Sprite
00:43 - renderer this was our robot and actually
00:46 - we're just going to go ahead and remove
00:48 - this component
00:49 - completely then we also have a 2d
00:52 - animator which right now has a animator
00:55 - controller attached we're going to keep
00:58 - the animator and also enable it but we
01:01 - are not going to use this animator we
01:04 - are going to use our own separate one
01:06 - that will we will set up uh to work with
01:09 - the current way we have set up our
01:10 - graphics and with our Sprite sheet so
01:14 - the animator right now works uh if we
01:16 - double click this you can we can view it
01:19 - and it's under the sample assets 2D
01:22 - animations here's the animator
01:24 - controller and you can see how the
01:26 - different animations work together you
01:29 - can also see we have a different some a
01:31 - few different
01:32 - parameters uh that will that these
01:35 - animations will transition based on but
01:39 - what we are going to do is create a bit
01:41 - more of a simple animator that will
01:43 - really only have an idle a walk and a
01:48 - jump uh so that's what we're going to do
01:51 - and uh we're going to come uh we're
01:53 - going to create a completely new one but
01:55 - let's just keep this around for now
01:57 - should we need to um uh need this for
02:01 - reference cool so let's head back into
02:04 - the scene view here let's head back
02:06 - under the assets and let's right click
02:09 - hit create animator controller and let's
02:13 - call this player controller actually
02:17 - let's do player anim
02:21 - controler there we go okay so player
02:25 - anom
02:26 - controller and let's drag this on onto
02:29 - the uh players animator make sure you do
02:33 - this or it of course won't
02:36 - work um now the way the animations were
02:39 - set up before is they were simply
02:42 - changing the Sprite in the Sprite
02:45 - component but now what right now we
02:47 - don't have a Sprite renderer our Sprite
02:49 - renderer instead sits on a separate
02:52 - object called Graphics this really gives
02:55 - us more control but also uh need will Al
03:00 - we will also need to access this game
03:03 - object Sprite renderer whenever we
03:05 - switch out
03:06 - Sprites so in order to do this let's
03:09 - create our first
03:11 - animation we do this by opening the
03:14 - animation window and please don't
03:16 - mistake this with the animator they are
03:18 - two separate
03:19 - Windows now let's hit um uh the uh this
03:25 - empty space or you can just hit record
03:27 - and let's hit create new clip and let's
03:30 - call this player
03:34 - idle and let's do anim and hit
03:38 - save so now in here we actually can
03:41 - place down different key frames for all
03:44 - sorts of different values for our
03:47 - player so if we hit add curve you can
03:50 - see that we have all kinds of component
03:53 - information and parameters and values
03:56 - that we can tweak uh during this
03:58 - timeline and we are going to delve into
04:01 - another object called the
04:03 - graphics and then under this we are
04:06 - going to uh delve into the Sprite
04:08 - renderer and then add the one called
04:12 - Sprite so this will allow us to change
04:14 - out the Sprite as we move forward and
04:17 - you can see right now it's simply set
04:18 - two key frames for the same
04:22 - Sprite and that is all we want this uh
04:25 - animation here is just going to be 1
04:28 - second long and it's not going to change
04:30 - anything it's simply going to have the
04:32 - idle Sprite attached so that we can
04:36 - transition to this and the player will
04:38 - just stand
04:39 - still you could of course have an a
04:42 - whole idle animation where he will maybe
04:45 - breathe in and out a bit or move or do a
04:48 - flip or something but for now to keep
04:51 - things simple and also because this is
04:54 - pixel out and it's it's difficult to do
04:57 - such fine movements we simply going to
04:59 - leave it as is then we're going to go
05:02 - ahead and create another animation so
05:04 - hit create new clip and let's call this
05:08 - player jump
05:11 - anim and this is going to be pretty much
05:13 - just as boring we're going to hit add
05:16 - curve go under the graphics under the
05:19 - Sprite renderer and add add the Sprite
05:22 - um parameter actually don't know what
05:25 - these are called uh let's just call them
05:27 - parameters for now
05:30 - and um instead of this Sprite here uh
05:34 - which is the idle Sprite we're going to
05:36 - insert our um jump Sprite and in order
05:40 - to do this we can simply select our
05:42 - graphic Graphics object in the hierarchy
05:46 - and go over to Sprite renderer and you
05:48 - will notice that the Sprite renderer
05:50 - Sprite setting has turned red and this
05:54 - is because it's currently being watched
05:56 - by the animator it's being recorded So
05:59 - what we can simply do is we can go in
06:01 - here and we can select the right one so
06:03 - we're going to select the jump one you
06:05 - can see astronaut jump double click that
06:09 - and now it's the astronaut jump but make
06:12 - sure that we switch it back over here
06:14 - also so maybe we can just delete this
06:17 - key frame and then copy the jump over so
06:21 - control C command C copy it over there
06:24 - and that's basically all we needed to do
06:28 - so now that we have this in place we can
06:30 - go ahead and create the only exciting
06:32 - animation we're going to be making today
06:34 - which is the walk or run animation
06:38 - um so let's just go ahead and do that so
06:41 - now let's stop
06:43 - recording and let's uh go into the
06:45 - project pane uh and instead of adding
06:48 - each separate Sprite and going through
06:52 - Unity has made a pretty cool very quick
06:55 - way to do these uh sorts of animations
06:59 - simply select the sequence by holding
07:01 - down shift clicking in the first bride
07:04 - holding down shift and then clicking at
07:06 - the last bride in the
07:07 - sequence and then simply drag into
07:10 - Unity this will simply create a new
07:13 - animation for us with those Sprites um
07:16 - in order so let's go ahead and save this
07:19 - as
07:21 - player uh let's do run let's just do
07:25 - walk and ANM and hit save and it will
07:30 - add in another uh another object here
07:33 - which has that um uh animation and it
07:36 - also has an animator and all that kind
07:38 - of stuff but we're just going to delete
07:40 - that and we're going to delete the
07:43 - um the uh automatically generated
07:47 - controller here also the astronaut
07:48 - Sprite Atlas unor Z just because we're
07:52 - not going to be needing that but the
07:54 - cool thing about this is that it
07:56 - automatically generated a player walk
07:59 - animation
07:59 - which we can use so now we simply all we
08:03 - need to do here um actually we we really
08:07 - don't need to do let's see oh yeah um
08:11 - the problem with this animation now when
08:12 - we go under the player and and play this
08:15 - animation uh we can just quickly do so
08:17 - maybe no actually yeah we can do so uh
08:20 - let's try and add it to the um animation
08:24 - controller here so double click the
08:26 - player animator uh anim controller and
08:29 - then you can see we have an idle a jump
08:31 - and a
08:32 - walk and uh if we go ahead and if you
08:36 - don't have these by the way all you need
08:38 - to do is right click hit create State
08:42 - empty and then select it and up here you
08:45 - can rename it let's say player shoot uh
08:49 - just for instance and then we can add a
08:52 - motion here so simply drag in the clip
08:55 - or instead of doing all that you can
08:57 - simply drag in the clip and it will aut
08:59 - automatically added for you cool so in
09:03 - once we're inside this animator
09:05 - controller we can make transitions
09:07 - between the different animations but
09:10 - right now I just want to check check out
09:12 - if the player walk animation will work
09:15 - my guess is that it won't because what
09:17 - we did when we created this is animate
09:20 - the Sprite renderer that sits on top of
09:22 - the player when really we need to
09:25 - animate the one under the graphics just
09:27 - with as with the two other animations
09:29 - but let's just have a go at it to see if
09:31 - it works in order to do this we need to
09:34 - make sure that this animation is the
09:36 - first one that will play and to do this
09:39 - we right click and hit set as default
09:41 - you can see that it's now orange which
09:44 - means that it will play by
09:46 - default so cool so we have an under the
09:49 - player we have an animator where we have
09:52 - the player anim controller um as the
09:55 - controller and inside of this we have
09:58 - three states
10:00 - where uh the default is the player walk
10:03 - animation let's see if this works don't
10:07 - think it will no indeed it doesn't it
10:10 - doesn't and
10:13 - uh yep it doesn't so uh let's instead go
10:17 - ahead and delete this player walk
10:19 - animation and create a a real one so
10:22 - let's go ahead ahead and select the
10:24 - player again select the animation you
10:26 - can see that we get a bunch of uh
10:28 - warnings here but that's because uh some
10:31 - of the um parameters aren't present yet
10:33 - we're going to add those in a sec let's
10:36 - go under the animation window here stop
10:37 - recording let's hit add curve uh no I'm
10:40 - sorry not add curve let's go ahead and
10:42 - create a new clip so we'll just do this
10:44 - by hand called player
10:47 - um walk anim hit save and uh let's see
10:53 - here if we duck this up
10:56 - here simply drag and drag and drop it to
10:59 - dock it and then select the sequence and
11:02 - drag it in here indeed we get key frames
11:06 - for that sequence but again it's
11:09 - changing the player Sprite and that's
11:11 - not what we want we want the graphic
11:13 - Sprite so let's R click and hit delete
11:16 - key oops not no remove property that's
11:19 - what it's called it's called property
11:21 - not parameter and let's hit add curve go
11:25 - into the graphics object go into the
11:27 - Sprite renderer go the Sprite and hit
11:30 - that and add that and now let's see if
11:33 - we delete this nope we don't want to do
11:35 - that let's just delete the last one
11:38 - maybe and let's see if if we drag this
11:40 - in nope okay so we're going to have to
11:43 - do this by hand so the first one here uh
11:46 - let's select the graphics object and
11:48 - let's select the uh astronaut Sprite
11:51 - Atlas _ Z then we're going to move
11:55 - forward let's
11:56 - do uh I don't know how fast we want this
12:00 - to go we can set the sample rate to 12
12:04 - and that's a basis um anything between
12:08 - maybe um 6 or eight to 16 is a normal
12:13 - sample rate for uh these kinds of 2D
12:15 - games sample rate is just how fast it
12:19 - will update uh think of it as frames per
12:21 - second it's basically the same thing uh
12:24 - but not quite so now we move forward one
12:27 - sample
12:29 - and uh let's change this to astronoid
12:33 - Sprite Atlas uncore one again move
12:36 - forward one change it to underscore two
12:39 - move forward one and I'm just going to
12:42 - quickly do
12:46 - these it's a good thing we don't have
12:48 - too many that's got to be an easier way
12:51 - and I have yet to find it there we go so
12:55 - now we have actually a full walk cycle
12:57 - so if we talk this down here again so we
13:00 - can see it in action and hit play you
13:02 - can see that our character is indeed
13:05 - doing a walk animation so let's try that
13:09 - one more time here select the uh oops
13:14 - where did our there so let's play this
13:17 - and you can see that he's walking back
13:19 - and
13:20 - forth um we could do some adjustment for
13:23 - the arm to make it follow we could add
13:25 - an animations for that also or we could
13:28 - do plenty of stuff but when we assumed
13:30 - out this much and moving at the same
13:33 - time I don't think it's going to be too
13:34 - noticeable so that's a second priority
13:37 - let's just get this working
13:39 - first cool uh now we need to set up the
13:43 - uh the animated controller so right now
13:45 - you can see we have a bunch of different
13:47 - states uh oops it's added too many
13:50 - actually let's delete this
13:53 - one and let's make sure that we add a
13:57 - motion to this one so the player walk
13:59 - Anem here let's just make sure we drag
14:01 - one under there and let's set the player
14:05 - Idol to be the
14:08 - default now we're going to add some
14:10 - different parameters down here so hit uh
14:13 - plus and the first one we're going to
14:15 - add uh we definitely going to need one
14:18 - called
14:19 - speed which is going to default a zero
14:23 - we're also going to need another one
14:24 - called
14:26 - ground or maybe it's grounded
14:29 - I don't remember that's why we kept the
14:32 - controller here it's just ground so that
14:35 - will be whenever we stand on the
14:37 - ground let's go back in
14:42 - here do
14:44 - ground we also going to need a uh
14:47 - Boolean for uh called a Crouch and we
14:53 - not going to be crouching with this
14:54 - character but we it is included in the
14:56 - script so we can either just add the the
14:59 - parameter here or go remove it in the
15:01 - script but for the sake of these we are
15:04 - just going to add it as a parameter and
15:07 - also uh that will allow us to do
15:09 - crouching later should we choose to do
15:11 - so it's not going to be uh impacting
15:14 - performance it's it's really not a big
15:16 - deal it's just changing a variable and
15:19 - then last up we are going to have
15:20 - another float called V speed for
15:23 - vertical speed and this is again not
15:26 - something we're going to be using but
15:27 - this could be uh used to see if the
15:30 - character is falling and then maybe make
15:33 - give him some kind of a fall fall
15:36 - animation but that's not something we're
15:38 - going to go into uh not yet anyways cool
15:43 - so he starts out with the player Idol
15:45 - animation and then we uh maybe want him
15:47 - to transition transition to a uh walk
15:51 - whenever our speed is increased so right
15:54 - click on the player Idol animation and
15:56 - hit make Transition you can see you get
15:59 - this Arrow which we're then going to
16:00 - click on the player walk
16:02 - animation and then click on the uh line
16:06 - itself and it will turn blue because we
16:08 - have it selected and in the inspector we
16:10 - now have a bunch of different settings
16:12 - that we can tweak we want to go in here
16:14 - and instead of exit time which is us
16:17 - used for blending we are going to
16:19 - do uh if uh
16:22 - speed uh maybe I should just quickly
16:25 - explain this this is our conditions uh
16:27 - up here this adjust how the animation
16:30 - Blends from one to another this is not
16:33 - so relevant relevant when we're doing
16:36 - Sprites but it is in 3D animation when
16:38 - you want a smooth transition from a walk
16:41 - to a run or from an idle to a walk but
16:44 - here we're not doing smooth transitions
16:46 - because we are simply changing
16:49 - Sprites um and down here is the
16:52 - conditions Tab and what this will do is
16:54 - will allow us to uh create basically if
16:58 - statements that will check for values
17:00 - and if they are met it will do the
17:03 - transition so we're going to select the
17:05 - first condition which is going to be
17:07 - speed and we're going to say that that
17:09 - has to be greater than and let's just do
17:12 - 0.1 so if the speed uh is greater than
17:15 - 0.1 it will just transition to the walk
17:18 - animation and then we can say uh make
17:20 - transition and then go back to the play
17:23 - idle animation and here we can simple
17:25 - simply say that if speed is less than
17:30 - 0.1 uh we are going to transition back
17:32 - again to our
17:34 - Idol then the player jump animation uh
17:37 - we really want the player to be able to
17:39 - jump both from the idle or from the walk
17:42 - so instead of adding transitions from
17:44 - both of them we're going to use the any
17:47 - state node so this will allow us to
17:49 - transition no matter what state we're in
17:53 - to that animation so let's right click
17:56 - on that hit make Transition let's click
17:58 - click on the um on the um the arrow here
18:03 - and that's select can transition sself
18:07 - then we are going to hit uh under the
18:10 - condition select
18:13 - ground is um what is it uh if ground is
18:18 - equal to false we are going to be
18:21 - jumping you can see this is very similar
18:24 - to the way they've set it up under the
18:25 - 2D character uh controller um that is
18:29 - included in the standard
18:31 - assets and you can also see that they
18:33 - simply transition back to the idle so
18:36 - whenever we're not jumping we are just
18:38 - by default going to go back to the idle
18:40 - and then from there we can transition on
18:42 - so let's just do the same so let's go
18:44 - back into the player animation animator
18:48 - controller and let's in here uh make a
18:50 - transition from the player jump
18:52 - animation to the idle and let's in the
18:55 - condition say that if ground is equal to
19:00 - false and that is basically all we need
19:03 - so now we should be able to hit
19:06 - play and you can see that when we start
19:08 - walking the walking animation
19:11 - plays and when we jump the jumping
19:14 - Sprite Place whoops for some reason uh
19:18 - we are not transitioning back let's see
19:21 - what is going on here and this is
19:23 - another cool thing if we um go ahead and
19:26 - maybe dark the animator over here and
19:28 - drag it out uh by the inspector we and
19:32 - then hit play we can in real time see
19:35 - how the animations are played and how
19:37 - the parameters are affected so let's hit
19:41 - jump we can see that the ground value is
19:44 - turned on again but it's staying at the
19:46 - player jump animation and it's not
19:48 - really trying to play this
19:51 - transition this suggest that we've set
19:53 - that up incorrectly now let's select the
19:56 - transition go under conditions and
19:59 - indeed we need to change this to
20:01 - true so now let's hit play
20:04 - again and actually let's maximize this
20:07 - because I think we've we deserve to see
20:09 - this in full screen so we stand still
20:12 - and the idol animation is
20:14 - playing I shouldn't really call it an an
20:17 - animation but the idol Sprite is there
20:19 - and then when we start walking you can
20:21 - see him playing the walk animation and
20:24 - when we in the air he's just doing his
20:26 - jumpy thing so that was basically it for
20:29 - this video I hope you enjoyed it
20:31 - remember that you can always F follow me
20:34 - on Twitter at Braes treat or get to me
20:37 - at facebook.com/ Braes if you want to
20:40 - know more about what I'm doing and uh
20:43 - just follow the progress of the videos
20:45 - uh there's also sometimes cool tips and
20:47 - tricks or if you want to get involved in
20:50 - any way cool so that was it for uh
20:52 - today's video thanks for watching and
20:54 - I'll see you in the next one
20:58 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to video number seven in the how to make a 2d platformer course today we're going to finally be adding some character animations uh by utilizing the scripts from the standard assets that's already sits on our player and setting up an animated controller that fits with that script so let's just di right into it today uh no long intros as always I've opened up Unity and you can see when we get in here and hit play that our character simply only flips and and doesn't really animate at all so if we select our player you can see that we have disabled the Sprite renderer this was our robot and actually we're just going to go ahead and remove this component completely then we also have a 2d animator which right now has a animator controller attached we're going to keep the animator and also enable it but we are not going to use this animator we are going to use our own separate one that will we will set up uh to work with the current way we have set up our graphics and with our Sprite sheet so the animator right now works uh if we double click this you can we can view it and it's under the sample assets 2D animations here's the animator controller and you can see how the different animations work together you can also see we have a different some a few different parameters uh that will that these animations will transition based on but what we are going to do is create a bit more of a simple animator that will really only have an idle a walk and a jump uh so that's what we're going to do and uh we're going to come uh we're going to create a completely new one but let's just keep this around for now should we need to um uh need this for reference cool so let's head back into the scene view here let's head back under the assets and let's right click hit create animator controller and let's call this player controller actually let's do player anim controler there we go okay so player anom controller and let's drag this on onto the uh players animator make sure you do this or it of course won't work um now the way the animations were set up before is they were simply changing the Sprite in the Sprite component but now what right now we don't have a Sprite renderer our Sprite renderer instead sits on a separate object called Graphics this really gives us more control but also uh need will Al we will also need to access this game object Sprite renderer whenever we switch out Sprites so in order to do this let's create our first animation we do this by opening the animation window and please don't mistake this with the animator they are two separate Windows now let's hit um uh the uh this empty space or you can just hit record and let's hit create new clip and let's call this player idle and let's do anim and hit save so now in here we actually can place down different key frames for all sorts of different values for our player so if we hit add curve you can see that we have all kinds of component information and parameters and values that we can tweak uh during this timeline and we are going to delve into another object called the graphics and then under this we are going to uh delve into the Sprite renderer and then add the one called Sprite so this will allow us to change out the Sprite as we move forward and you can see right now it's simply set two key frames for the same Sprite and that is all we want this uh animation here is just going to be 1 second long and it's not going to change anything it's simply going to have the idle Sprite attached so that we can transition to this and the player will just stand still you could of course have an a whole idle animation where he will maybe breathe in and out a bit or move or do a flip or something but for now to keep things simple and also because this is pixel out and it's it's difficult to do such fine movements we simply going to leave it as is then we're going to go ahead and create another animation so hit create new clip and let's call this player jump anim and this is going to be pretty much just as boring we're going to hit add curve go under the graphics under the Sprite renderer and add add the Sprite um parameter actually don't know what these are called uh let's just call them parameters for now and um instead of this Sprite here uh which is the idle Sprite we're going to insert our um jump Sprite and in order to do this we can simply select our graphic Graphics object in the hierarchy and go over to Sprite renderer and you will notice that the Sprite renderer Sprite setting has turned red and this is because it's currently being watched by the animator it's being recorded So what we can simply do is we can go in here and we can select the right one so we're going to select the jump one you can see astronaut jump double click that and now it's the astronaut jump but make sure that we switch it back over here also so maybe we can just delete this key frame and then copy the jump over so control C command C copy it over there and that's basically all we needed to do so now that we have this in place we can go ahead and create the only exciting animation we're going to be making today which is the walk or run animation um so let's just go ahead and do that so now let's stop recording and let's uh go into the project pane uh and instead of adding each separate Sprite and going through Unity has made a pretty cool very quick way to do these uh sorts of animations simply select the sequence by holding down shift clicking in the first bride holding down shift and then clicking at the last bride in the sequence and then simply drag into Unity this will simply create a new animation for us with those Sprites um in order so let's go ahead and save this as player uh let's do run let's just do walk and ANM and hit save and it will add in another uh another object here which has that um uh animation and it also has an animator and all that kind of stuff but we're just going to delete that and we're going to delete the um the uh automatically generated controller here also the astronaut Sprite Atlas unor Z just because we're not going to be needing that but the cool thing about this is that it automatically generated a player walk animation which we can use so now we simply all we need to do here um actually we we really don't need to do let's see oh yeah um the problem with this animation now when we go under the player and and play this animation uh we can just quickly do so maybe no actually yeah we can do so uh let's try and add it to the um animation controller here so double click the player animator uh anim controller and then you can see we have an idle a jump and a walk and uh if we go ahead and if you don't have these by the way all you need to do is right click hit create State empty and then select it and up here you can rename it let's say player shoot uh just for instance and then we can add a motion here so simply drag in the clip or instead of doing all that you can simply drag in the clip and it will aut automatically added for you cool so in once we're inside this animator controller we can make transitions between the different animations but right now I just want to check check out if the player walk animation will work my guess is that it won't because what we did when we created this is animate the Sprite renderer that sits on top of the player when really we need to animate the one under the graphics just with as with the two other animations but let's just have a go at it to see if it works in order to do this we need to make sure that this animation is the first one that will play and to do this we right click and hit set as default you can see that it's now orange which means that it will play by default so cool so we have an under the player we have an animator where we have the player anim controller um as the controller and inside of this we have three states where uh the default is the player walk animation let's see if this works don't think it will no indeed it doesn't it doesn't and uh yep it doesn't so uh let's instead go ahead and delete this player walk animation and create a a real one so let's go ahead ahead and select the player again select the animation you can see that we get a bunch of uh warnings here but that's because uh some of the um parameters aren't present yet we're going to add those in a sec let's go under the animation window here stop recording let's hit add curve uh no I'm sorry not add curve let's go ahead and create a new clip so we'll just do this by hand called player um walk anim hit save and uh let's see here if we duck this up here simply drag and drag and drop it to dock it and then select the sequence and drag it in here indeed we get key frames for that sequence but again it's changing the player Sprite and that's not what we want we want the graphic Sprite so let's R click and hit delete key oops not no remove property that's what it's called it's called property not parameter and let's hit add curve go into the graphics object go into the Sprite renderer go the Sprite and hit that and add that and now let's see if we delete this nope we don't want to do that let's just delete the last one maybe and let's see if if we drag this in nope okay so we're going to have to do this by hand so the first one here uh let's select the graphics object and let's select the uh astronaut Sprite Atlas _ Z then we're going to move forward let's do uh I don't know how fast we want this to go we can set the sample rate to 12 and that's a basis um anything between maybe um 6 or eight to 16 is a normal sample rate for uh these kinds of 2D games sample rate is just how fast it will update uh think of it as frames per second it's basically the same thing uh but not quite so now we move forward one sample and uh let's change this to astronoid Sprite Atlas uncore one again move forward one change it to underscore two move forward one and I'm just going to quickly do these it's a good thing we don't have too many that's got to be an easier way and I have yet to find it there we go so now we have actually a full walk cycle so if we talk this down here again so we can see it in action and hit play you can see that our character is indeed doing a walk animation so let's try that one more time here select the uh oops where did our there so let's play this and you can see that he's walking back and forth um we could do some adjustment for the arm to make it follow we could add an animations for that also or we could do plenty of stuff but when we assumed out this much and moving at the same time I don't think it's going to be too noticeable so that's a second priority let's just get this working first cool uh now we need to set up the uh the animated controller so right now you can see we have a bunch of different states uh oops it's added too many actually let's delete this one and let's make sure that we add a motion to this one so the player walk Anem here let's just make sure we drag one under there and let's set the player Idol to be the default now we're going to add some different parameters down here so hit uh plus and the first one we're going to add uh we definitely going to need one called speed which is going to default a zero we're also going to need another one called ground or maybe it's grounded I don't remember that's why we kept the controller here it's just ground so that will be whenever we stand on the ground let's go back in here do ground we also going to need a uh Boolean for uh called a Crouch and we not going to be crouching with this character but we it is included in the script so we can either just add the the parameter here or go remove it in the script but for the sake of these we are just going to add it as a parameter and also uh that will allow us to do crouching later should we choose to do so it's not going to be uh impacting performance it's it's really not a big deal it's just changing a variable and then last up we are going to have another float called V speed for vertical speed and this is again not something we're going to be using but this could be uh used to see if the character is falling and then maybe make give him some kind of a fall fall animation but that's not something we're going to go into uh not yet anyways cool so he starts out with the player Idol animation and then we uh maybe want him to transition transition to a uh walk whenever our speed is increased so right click on the player Idol animation and hit make Transition you can see you get this Arrow which we're then going to click on the player walk animation and then click on the uh line itself and it will turn blue because we have it selected and in the inspector we now have a bunch of different settings that we can tweak we want to go in here and instead of exit time which is us used for blending we are going to do uh if uh speed uh maybe I should just quickly explain this this is our conditions uh up here this adjust how the animation Blends from one to another this is not so relevant relevant when we're doing Sprites but it is in 3D animation when you want a smooth transition from a walk to a run or from an idle to a walk but here we're not doing smooth transitions because we are simply changing Sprites um and down here is the conditions Tab and what this will do is will allow us to uh create basically if statements that will check for values and if they are met it will do the transition so we're going to select the first condition which is going to be speed and we're going to say that that has to be greater than and let's just do 0.1 so if the speed uh is greater than 0.1 it will just transition to the walk animation and then we can say uh make transition and then go back to the play idle animation and here we can simple simply say that if speed is less than 0.1 uh we are going to transition back again to our Idol then the player jump animation uh we really want the player to be able to jump both from the idle or from the walk so instead of adding transitions from both of them we're going to use the any state node so this will allow us to transition no matter what state we're in to that animation so let's right click on that hit make Transition let's click click on the um on the um the arrow here and that's select can transition sself then we are going to hit uh under the condition select ground is um what is it uh if ground is equal to false we are going to be jumping you can see this is very similar to the way they've set it up under the 2D character uh controller um that is included in the standard assets and you can also see that they simply transition back to the idle so whenever we're not jumping we are just by default going to go back to the idle and then from there we can transition on so let's just do the same so let's go back into the player animation animator controller and let's in here uh make a transition from the player jump animation to the idle and let's in the condition say that if ground is equal to false and that is basically all we need so now we should be able to hit play and you can see that when we start walking the walking animation plays and when we jump the jumping Sprite Place whoops for some reason uh we are not transitioning back let's see what is going on here and this is another cool thing if we um go ahead and maybe dark the animator over here and drag it out uh by the inspector we and then hit play we can in real time see how the animations are played and how the parameters are affected so let's hit jump we can see that the ground value is turned on again but it's staying at the player jump animation and it's not really trying to play this transition this suggest that we've set that up incorrectly now let's select the transition go under conditions and indeed we need to change this to true so now let's hit play again and actually let's maximize this because I think we've we deserve to see this in full screen so we stand still and the idol animation is playing I shouldn't really call it an an animation but the idol Sprite is there and then when we start walking you can see him playing the walk animation and when we in the air he's just doing his jumpy thing so that was basically it for this video I hope you enjoyed it
