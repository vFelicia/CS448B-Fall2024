00:00 - one of my favorite effects in videogames
00:01 - and movies is dissolved it's just such a
00:06 - cool way to animate an object in or out
00:08 - and it looks really complicated but it's
00:10 - actually a fairly easy effect to achieve
00:12 - so in this video we'll have a look at
00:14 - how to create a simple dissolve effect
00:16 - using shader graph and you can easily
00:17 - apply or tweak the same concept to
00:19 - create more advanced or interesting
00:21 - looks also this video is sponsored by a
00:23 - skill share skill share is an online
00:25 - learning community with more than 19
00:27 - thousand in quality classes on game
00:29 - development tech and more I recently
00:30 - stumbled upon this awesome course on
00:32 - designing playing cards this course
00:34 - dives into all the things you need to
00:36 - consider when developing a card game
00:38 - which apparently is a lot so if you want
00:41 - to make a virtual card game a tabletop
00:43 - or you're just fascinated like I am
00:45 - definitely check it out a premium skill
00:47 - share membership gives you unlimited
00:48 - access to all classes for less than $10
00:51 - a month so to get started simply click
00:53 - the link in the description and the
00:54 - first 500 people will receive their
00:56 - first two months for free alright let's
00:58 - get started so here we have the same
01:00 - scene as in the intro video we have a
01:02 - camera a couple of Lights a tiny bit of
01:04 - post processing as well as this monkey
01:07 - which is currently just using standard
01:09 - settings so let's go ahead and create
01:11 - our own shader for this monkey to do
01:13 - that let's go to project going to create
01:15 - and under shader
01:17 - let's select PPR graph we call the
01:19 - shader to solve and open it up in shader
01:22 - graph we'll double click it we can then
01:24 - maximize this window and we're ready to
01:26 - start creating our shader the first
01:28 - thing that I'm gonna do is just adjust
01:30 - the albedo here to make it a bit darker
01:32 - I think that looks a lot cooler and it
01:35 - will also help our effects stand out now
01:37 - this effect is kind of split up into two
01:39 - parts the first one is adjusting the
01:42 - transparency of our model in order to
01:44 - kind of animate it in and out and the
01:46 - second one is creating a glowing edge on
01:49 - top of this animation so let's start by
01:51 - adjusting the transparency of our model
01:53 - to animate it in and out now for both
01:55 - these effect we're going to be using
01:57 - some noise so I'm gonna hit space and
01:59 - create some simple noise here I'm gonna
02:01 - set the scale to something like 30 and
02:04 - you can see the cloudy texture is that
02:05 - it generates here we're gonna take the
02:07 - output of this node and feed it into the
02:09 - alpha of our PBR master node and right
02:12 - away you shouldn't really
02:13 - be able to see anything but if you want
02:15 - to preview the alpha Channel we can go
02:18 - ahead and set the surface from opaque to
02:20 - transparent and now we can see how the
02:22 - whiter parts of our texture are visible
02:24 - whereas the black parts are transparent
02:27 - now of course we don't want to show this
02:29 - on an object this way so I'm just going
02:31 - to switch back to opaque instead what we
02:33 - want to do is kind of animate through
02:35 - this texture using the Alpha clip
02:37 - threshold and just to show you this
02:39 - happening I'm just gonna create a symbol
02:40 - node to control it I'm just gonna go
02:42 - ahead and hit space and search for a
02:44 - vector one this is basically just a
02:46 - float we're then gonna take the output
02:48 - of the float and feed it into Alpha clip
02:50 - threshold and now we can adjust it right
02:52 - here if I go ahead and increase it we
02:54 - can see that our object is animating out
02:56 - in this cool way and if I decrease it it
02:59 - will come back now what's happening here
03:02 - well if we have a look at the Alpha
03:04 - Channel we're currently generating a
03:05 - noise texture each one of the pixels on
03:08 - this texture has a value between zero
03:10 - and one representing its brightness the
03:13 - first one for example has a value of 0.8
03:15 - the second 1.9 and so on if we then set
03:19 - the Alpha clip threshold to say 0.7 what
03:22 - we are essentially asking unity to do is
03:25 - go through each of the pixels one by one
03:27 - and ask a simple question is this value
03:30 - larger than 0.7 if it is which is the
03:34 - case with the first pixel here we make
03:36 - it visible when we reach a value that
03:38 - isn't greater than 0.7 like this pixel
03:40 - here we don't include it and so this
03:43 - part will be invisible by doing this for
03:45 - all the pixels we get something that
03:47 - looks like this if you've ever used the
03:50 - threshold adjustment in Photoshop this
03:52 - works in much the same way pretty cool
03:54 - so what that means is by increasing this
03:56 - to one we're animating our object out
03:58 - and by decreasing it to zero we are
04:01 - animating it back in now of course if we
04:04 - wanted to control this in the editor we
04:06 - could right click here and convert it to
04:08 - a property or we could just have this
04:10 - happen automatically over time to do
04:13 - that let's delete this node instead
04:15 - we'll go ahead and create a time node
04:16 - from this I'm gonna take the sine of
04:19 - time and I'm gonna feed it into a remap
04:21 - node and I want it to go in the in
04:24 - channel now by default sine of time goes
04:26 - between negative
04:27 - one and one that's the values here and
04:30 - we're simply remapping it Tony go from
04:32 - zero to one you can see the effect of it
04:35 - here I'm then gonna take the output from
04:37 - this node and feed it into alpha clip
04:39 - threshold and voila our object is
04:42 - animating in and out on its own so
04:44 - that's the first part of the effect the
04:47 - second part is adding the edge and you
04:49 - were using a node that works very
04:51 - similar to the Alpha clip threshold let
04:54 - me show you this so if we take our
04:56 - simple noise and drag it out so we're
04:58 - gonna drag it out to another node and
05:00 - this node is going to be the step node
05:03 - so our symbol noise is both outputting
05:05 - to the alpha as well as the edge of our
05:08 - step node and if I now adjust this value
05:09 - here we can see that I can kind of
05:12 - animate through the noise exactly the
05:15 - same way that the Alpha clip threshold
05:17 - is animating through it on our object
05:19 - and that's because these step node is
05:21 - doing the exact same thing it's going
05:22 - through each individual pixel and
05:24 - determining whether or not it has a
05:26 - value greater or lower than this value
05:29 - here if it has it's going to include it
05:31 - and if not it's just going to be black
05:33 - and so we can animate it in the exact
05:35 - same way by taking the output of our
05:37 - sine of time here and putting it right
05:40 - into our step function and as you can
05:42 - see it's working just fine I'm just
05:45 - gonna move my notes out a little bit
05:46 - here and we could theoretically take our
05:48 - step function now and put it into the
05:51 - emission however we wouldn't actually be
05:54 - able to see the result of this and the
05:55 - reason why is that right now it's only
05:57 - applying emission to the part that are
06:00 - transparent if we went ahead and said
06:02 - remove the connection here to the Alpha
06:04 - clip threshold we can actually see the
06:06 - emission animating just fine I'm just
06:09 - going to go ahead and put that back so
06:11 - what we need to do is just offset this
06:13 - emission a tiny bit and we can actually
06:16 - do that really easily all we need to do
06:19 - is just move this out a bit and itself
06:21 - going straight into the step function
06:23 - will delete that will instead go through
06:25 - an ADD node so we're going to add a
06:28 - value here and we don't need the preview
06:30 - and the value that we're going to be add
06:31 - is going to be pretty small let's just
06:33 - try adding point zero one and let's then
06:36 - feed the output of this into the step
06:38 - function and as you can see everything
06:40 - works a spife
06:41 - for but because we've shifted time for a
06:43 - step function a tiny bit we can now see
06:45 - the edge of our emission so that's super
06:48 - cool and if we wanted to control the
06:50 - thickness of it we could do that by
06:52 - simply adjusting this value so we could
06:54 - make it super thick or super thin I'm
06:57 - just gonna keep it at point zero one
06:59 - finally we can of course control the
07:01 - color of our edge to do that we'll move
07:03 - all this stuff out a bit we'll take the
07:05 - output of our step function and put it
07:08 - into a multiply node and I'm also going
07:11 - to input another node here which is
07:12 - going to be a color I'm gonna change the
07:15 - mode here to HDR so that we can put
07:17 - really bright values and have a glow
07:19 - let's just set the color to say a light
07:21 - blue with a pretty high intensity let's
07:25 - translate that to four and we can now
07:27 - take the output of this multiply node
07:29 - here and drag that into emission instead
07:32 - and voila our edge is now blue pretty
07:36 - cool of course there are a few
07:37 - properties that I want to be able to
07:39 - control individually for each material
07:41 - so let's go ahead and make some
07:43 - properties for this the first one is of
07:45 - course the color that's right here so we
07:47 - can simply right-click that and convert
07:49 - it to a property and then up here we can
07:51 - rename this property to something like
07:53 - edge color I think it's also a good idea
07:56 - to be able to control the thickness of
07:58 - our edge so let's go up here and add a
08:01 - vector one let's call it edge width I
08:03 - will just default this to point zero one
08:06 - drag it into shader graph and create a
08:09 - link from this to the add method and
08:11 - finally it's also pretty neat if we get
08:13 - to control the scale of our noise so
08:15 - that we can make the effect smaller or
08:18 - larger for this let's just create
08:20 - another vector one this one is going to
08:22 - be the noise scale and I'm just gonna
08:25 - default this to 30 because I think that
08:27 - looks pretty nice let's drag it in SA
08:29 - node and it's put it into our scale
08:32 - channel on the noise function also right
08:34 - now when the animation is happening we
08:36 - can actually not see inside of our
08:39 - sphere the back faces of our model are
08:41 - completely invisible to change this we
08:44 - can simply check the two sided checkbox
08:46 - here and now we can actually see inside
08:49 - of our model which is a pretty cool
08:51 - effect we then hit save go back to the
08:54 - editor
08:54 - let's elect the monkey material and
08:56 - under shader
08:57 - we'll go to graphs and select our new
08:59 - dissolve shader and right away we can
09:02 - see this working if we want a smooth
09:03 - preview we can always press play and
09:05 - there we go our object is now animating
09:08 - in and out using this cold laser II
09:10 - effect and we can easily adjust the edge
09:13 - colors that we wanted to make it kind of
09:15 - purple we could make it
09:17 - fiery red or we could make it green it's
09:20 - really easy to adjust we can even go in
09:22 - here and increase how much it glows so
09:24 - if we wanted to really pop we can bump
09:26 - up the intensity that might be a bit too
09:29 - much and we can of course change the
09:31 - width of the effect as well as these
09:33 - scales so I'm gonna put that to say 15
09:36 - or maybe 50 and I think you get the idea
09:38 - awesome that's pretty much it for this
09:41 - video
09:41 - from here it's up to you to play around
09:43 - with the effect and try adding and
09:45 - changing different nodes to see how it
09:46 - affects the result you could for example
09:48 - try using a Voronoi node instead of
09:50 - simple noise to drive the dissolve
09:52 - effect which looks pretty cool also

Cleaned transcript:

one of my favorite effects in videogames and movies is dissolved it's just such a cool way to animate an object in or out and it looks really complicated but it's actually a fairly easy effect to achieve so in this video we'll have a look at how to create a simple dissolve effect using shader graph and you can easily apply or tweak the same concept to create more advanced or interesting looks also this video is sponsored by a skill share skill share is an online learning community with more than 19 thousand in quality classes on game development tech and more I recently stumbled upon this awesome course on designing playing cards this course dives into all the things you need to consider when developing a card game which apparently is a lot so if you want to make a virtual card game a tabletop or you're just fascinated like I am definitely check it out a premium skill share membership gives you unlimited access to all classes for less than $10 a month so to get started simply click the link in the description and the first 500 people will receive their first two months for free alright let's get started so here we have the same scene as in the intro video we have a camera a couple of Lights a tiny bit of post processing as well as this monkey which is currently just using standard settings so let's go ahead and create our own shader for this monkey to do that let's go to

to be a color I'm gonna change the mode here to HDR so that we can put really bright values and have a glow let's just set the color to say a light blue with a pretty high intensity let's translate
