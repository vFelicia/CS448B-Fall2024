00:00 - in this video we're going to have some
00:01 - fun with some interesting 2d physics
00:02 - components they called effectors and
00:04 - they can actually be really useful we'll
00:06 - have a look at the area effector the
00:07 - surface effector the point effector the
00:09 - buoyancy effector and the platform
00:11 - effector also I'm sorry I missed the
00:12 - video last Wednesday I caught a cold and
00:14 - yeah it was bad but I'm over it so let's
00:17 - get in turn so in this scene I have a
00:19 - background sky they ground with the 2d
00:21 - box Collider and an asteroid the sprites
00:23 - that I'm using are made by unity and are
00:25 - available for free on the asset store
00:26 - that will be a link in the description
00:27 - so first let's go ahead and add a new
00:29 - circle Collider to our asteroid let's
00:31 - focus on it and let's decrease the
00:33 - radius so it matches let's also go ahead
00:35 - and add a rigidbody 2d in order to apply
00:37 - physics to our cake so now when we hit
00:39 - play we should see it fall to the ground
00:41 - cool
00:41 - the first component I want to have a
00:43 - look at is this surface effector if we
00:44 - go ahead and select our ground hit add
00:46 - component and add the surface effector
00:49 - 2d in order to use this we'll have to
00:51 - mark our Collider as used by a vector so
00:54 - what this component will now do is apply
00:56 - a force along the surface of the
00:57 - collider in order to match a specified
01:00 - speed think of the way a conveyor belt
01:02 - works at the airport so if we hit play
01:04 - now we should see that as soon as our
01:06 - ball hits the surface Air Force does
01:08 - indeed get applied and it slowly rolls
01:10 - along the surface we can decrease the
01:13 - speed here and actually make it go the
01:14 - other way we can also change the force
01:17 - scale this is the amount of force that
01:19 - we're going to add to our object in
01:20 - order to try and achieve the desired
01:22 - speed so if we set our speed to say 5
01:24 - and bump up a force scale to 1 we should
01:27 - see that our ball immediately
01:29 - accelerates however if we set ours for
01:31 - scale to something smaller say point 0 1
01:34 - we can see that it slowly increases in
01:36 - speed the speed variation allows us to
01:38 - add a random increase in speed we can
01:40 - also make this negative remember you can
01:42 - always control the collider in this
01:44 - component effects you do that by simply
01:46 - disabling a layer from the collider mask
01:48 - so if we didn't want this to affect
01:49 - water we would disable water and this is
01:52 - true to pretty much all of the effectors
01:54 - finally under options we have the
01:55 - possibility of using contact force this
01:58 - means that the force will be applied at
02:00 - the point of contact instead of at the
02:02 - center of the collider
02:03 - so if we enable this we should see that
02:05 - it very quickly rotates that's because
02:07 - the point of contact is always at the
02:09 - bottom of our sphere and so it's going
02:11 - to add torque because we are pushing at
02:13 - the bar
02:13 - my first fear and so we'll start to
02:15 - rotate around its center I'm just going
02:17 - to disable this for now and at the very
02:18 - bottom here you have two toggles design
02:20 - multiple of the effectors and they
02:22 - simply allow you to enable or disable
02:23 - friction and bounce from the physics
02:25 - material sitting on this object so next
02:27 - up is the area effector if you go ahead
02:29 - and right-click hit create empty let's
02:31 - reset the transform on this object and
02:33 - call it something like force field we
02:35 - then add a new component the component
02:37 - we need is a box Collider 2d this is
02:39 - required by the area vector well then
02:41 - add the area effector itself again we'll
02:44 - have to check use by a vector and for
02:46 - this component we also want to mark the
02:48 - collider as a trigger so the area
02:50 - effector applies forces within a certain
02:52 - area and our area is defined by the size
02:54 - of our Collider so if we're going here
02:55 - and say scale up this component a bit
02:58 - and we can maybe also move it over to
03:00 - the right here we should now see that
03:01 - whenever our asteroid enters this field
03:04 - it's going to apply a force in the right
03:06 - direction and it's going to do so with a
03:08 - magnitude of 10 so if we hit play and
03:10 - see our asteroid fall to the ground you
03:12 - should see it speed up as soon as it
03:14 - gets to our area effector it did but it
03:16 - wasn't too visible we can go ahead and
03:18 - up the magnitude let's set it to 30 and
03:20 - we can also add an angle say if we
03:22 - wanted this area effector to have the
03:24 - ball shoot upwards well then we would go
03:26 - ahead and add the force angle of 90
03:28 - degrees because if we move 90 degrees
03:30 - around the z axis it's going to shoot up
03:32 - so if we now hit play and wait for a
03:34 - meteor to enter the force field we can
03:36 - see that it gets shot up into the air
03:37 - this angle is currently relative to the
03:39 - orientation of our object so if we go
03:41 - ahead and rotate our force field along
03:43 - with the axis we should see that the
03:44 - direction in which our asteroid gets
03:46 - shot does also change if this is not
03:48 - what we want we check use global angle
03:51 - and so it will always get shot upwards
03:53 - there a vector also allows us to add
03:55 - some variation to our force and choose
03:57 - where we want to apply our force if it's
03:59 - set to rigidbody it's going to apply it
04:00 - at the center of mass of our rigidbody
04:02 - 2d and if we set it to Collider it's
04:05 - going to apply force to the current
04:06 - position of our Collider in our case
04:08 - that should mean the same because we're
04:09 - dealing with a totally circular object
04:11 - but for more complex objects that might
04:13 - make a difference finally we can also
04:15 - apply damping to a rigid body or in
04:17 - other words we can apply linear air
04:19 - resistance or rotational air resistance
04:21 - I very rarely find a use case for this
04:23 - next up is my personal favorite it's the
04:25 - point effector the point effect that
04:27 - apply
04:27 - as forces to either attract or repulse
04:30 - against a certain point note that I've
04:32 - set the gravity of an asteroid to zero
04:34 - so that it's just going to hang around
04:35 - in empty space in order to add a point
04:38 - effector we're actually going to have to
04:39 - add yet another Collider to this object
04:42 - yes you can have more than one circle
04:44 - Collider on an object so we'll add a
04:46 - circle Collider 2d and this one we're
04:48 - going to bump up the radius quite a bit
04:50 - that's because the radius here
04:51 - determines whether or not a nearby
04:53 - object is going to be affected by a
04:55 - point effector so let's make the reach
04:56 - of this fairly big we can then mark this
04:58 - as trigger and as used by effective
05:01 - let's then add a component and this is
05:02 - of course going to be the point effector
05:04 - now the force magnitude is of course the
05:06 - amount of force that we want to apply
05:07 - and this is negative if you want it to
05:09 - attract and positive if you want it to
05:11 - repulse if we go ahead and duplicate
05:13 - this asteroid now and move it over here
05:15 - and hit play we should see that that you
05:17 - very quickly clash together however the
05:20 - force that is being applied is currently
05:22 - constant meaning that as long as these
05:24 - two objects are within reach of each
05:26 - other we'll apply a constant force with
05:28 - a magnitude ten to each asteroid in the
05:30 - direction of the other asteroid this is
05:32 - fine for in many cases but when it comes
05:34 - to gravitational attraction as is the
05:37 - case between these two asteroids a good
05:39 - friend Newton actually stated that the
05:41 - force being applied to these is
05:43 - proportional to the product of the two
05:45 - masses and inversely proportional to the
05:47 - square of the distance between them we
05:49 - call this law the law of universal
05:51 - gravitation and the relation between
05:53 - force and distance we call that inverse
05:55 - squared so if we want fairly realistic
05:57 - gravitational simulation that is what we
06:00 - would use though if I go ahead and apply
06:02 - that both our objects here we should see
06:04 - that the closer they get to each other
06:06 - the quicker they will accelerate we can
06:09 - then grab any of these asteroids here
06:11 - and you can see it's really quick and
06:12 - fun to play around with we can also
06:14 - duplicate one of them to introduce even
06:16 - more into the scene here and you can see
06:18 - how quickly you can get fairly realistic
06:21 - gravitational movement and it's really
06:23 - easy to go in here and tweak different
06:25 - parameters you could go in here and
06:27 - thumb up the mass on one of these
06:29 - objects so that is actually not going to
06:31 - have any effect on the force being
06:32 - applied so what you could do is increase
06:34 - the force magnitude together with the
06:36 - mass of the different objects and that
06:38 - would mean that the more heavier objects
06:40 - applied a great
06:41 - attraction or force to the audio objects
06:44 - as stated by Newton's law but if you
06:46 - want to learn more about this sort of
06:47 - stuff I suggest to check out my video on
06:49 - forces where we go a lot more in depth
06:51 - so just click the covers around the
06:52 - asteroid it's a bunch of times and I
06:54 - also made this ball here which is the
06:56 - exact same thing except it has a
06:57 - positive force magnitude now when we hit
07:00 - play we should see some of the objects
07:01 - here stick together and some of them are
07:03 - repelled by the pole then we have the
07:05 - buoyancy affected to D and probably the
07:08 - most common use case for this is water
07:10 - or other kinds of fluids and it
07:12 - basically gives you a bunch of options
07:14 - to determine how an object looks load on
07:16 - top of a surface so in my case here I
07:18 - went ahead and created this water sprite
07:20 - in Photoshop and I added a box Collider
07:22 - 2d to it again we also have the asteroid
07:25 - here with a circle Collider in a
07:26 - rigidbody right now when we hit play our
07:28 - asteroid simply lands on the water and
07:30 - it doesn't look super good to change
07:32 - that let's go to our water and let's go
07:34 - ahead and add a new component we want to
07:35 - add the buoyancy effector 2d we also
07:38 - want to mark our Collider as trigger and
07:40 - as used by effector and now right off
07:42 - the bat when we hit play it's actually
07:44 - going to look a whole lot better the two
07:46 - primary things that you want to adjust
07:48 - here is the surface level this is just
07:50 - the surface location of the buoyancy
07:51 - fluid so if we go ahead and subtract a
07:53 - bit from this you can see that our
07:55 - object will find rest at a lower point
07:57 - for example in this case I think it
07:58 - works a lot better if our surface level
08:00 - is actually a bit deeper and then we
08:02 - have the density of our fluid and
08:04 - without getting into a deep explanation
08:05 - of Newtonian fluids and fluid mechanics
08:07 - I will say that the more dense a fluid
08:10 - the easier it's going to be for objects
08:12 - to float on top you can see this as I
08:14 - raise the density of a fluid our
08:16 - asteroid will be pushed to the top and
08:18 - as I decrease it it will actually start
08:20 - sinking you can also see what happens if
08:22 - we have a very sudden shift in density
08:24 - the forces that are being applied are
08:26 - going to be so great that our asteroid
08:28 - will be shut up words
08:29 - finally a buoyancy effect it also allows
08:31 - us to adjust damping as we've seen
08:33 - before and even add flow along a surface
08:35 - this works in pretty much the exact same
08:38 - way as our area effector we have a
08:40 - magnitude which we can also use the
08:41 - control Direction an angle and a flow
08:44 - variation the final thing that I want to
08:45 - cover in this video is the platform
08:47 - effector this component applies various
08:49 - platform like behavior the most
08:51 - important one is probably one-way
08:53 - collisions
08:54 - I've set up this example here
08:55 - we have our asteroid sitting at ground
08:57 - level right on top of that we have a
08:58 - force field it's going to apply an
09:00 - upwards force making it jump upwards and
09:03 - we have a platform with the Box Collider
09:04 - 2d so right now we hit play and our
09:07 - asteroid gets shut up and it's going to
09:09 - hit the platform and it's not really
09:10 - going to get anywhere but a very common
09:13 - thing that you want to do in platformer
09:15 - games is give characters the possibility
09:17 - of jumping on top of platforms by first
09:19 - going through them and then landing on
09:21 - them and this is what we referred to as
09:23 - one-way collision to add this we're
09:25 - simply going here at the platform
09:27 - effector 2d we then want to check use by
09:29 - vector not as trigger this time and make
09:32 - sure that under the settings under
09:33 - one-way it says use one-way now when we
09:36 - hit play our asteroid should shoot right
09:39 - through the platform and land on top of
09:41 - it if we go into the scene view we can
09:43 - also see that we now have this arc on
09:45 - top of our platform this is adjusted
09:47 - using the surface arc and this arc
09:48 - basically just defines the surface that
09:51 - doesn't allow colliders to pass meaning
09:53 - that anything outside of the arc is
09:55 - considered for one-way collision in most
09:57 - cases this is just going to be 180 you
09:58 - can also use the rotational offset in
10:00 - case you want to flip things around if
10:02 - we set this to 180 now take our asteroid
10:05 - here and drag them up and have them fall
10:07 - down you can see that it now works in
10:09 - the opposite way and finally under sides
10:11 - here we can adjust whether or not we
10:13 - want to use side friction and side
10:15 - bounds this means that if we have some
10:17 - kind of physics material applied to our
10:19 - platform say we wanted to make this
10:21 - platform bouncy we can choose whether or
10:23 - not we want that to take effect when we
10:25 - hit the sides of the platform so let's
10:27 - go in here and create a physics material
10:29 - and let's call this one bouncy we can
10:31 - set the friction to point 4 that's fine
10:33 - and the bouncing is to 1 then under our
10:35 - platform that's going to box Collider 2d
10:37 - and drag in our bouncy material we
10:39 - should now see that when we hit play our
10:41 - platform is indeed bouncy but since use
10:44 - side bounces currently turned off if we
10:46 - just disable use one way here let's
10:49 - rotate the platform 90 degrees around
10:51 - the Z let's also move up our asteroid we
10:54 - shouldn't actually see bouncing and
10:56 - indeed it does not so use this component
10:58 - wisely it can definitely help you get
11:00 - around a lot of the annoying control
11:01 - stuff when making a quick 2d platformer

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to have some fun with some interesting 2d physics components they called effectors and they can actually be really useful we'll have a look at the area effector the surface effector the point effector the buoyancy effector and the platform effector also I'm sorry I missed the video last Wednesday I caught a cold and yeah it was bad but I'm over it so let's get in turn so in this scene I have a background sky they ground with the 2d box Collider and an asteroid the sprites that I'm using are made by unity and are available for free on the asset store that will be a link in the description so first let's go ahead and add a new circle Collider to our asteroid let's focus on it and let's decrease the radius so it matches let's also go ahead and add a rigidbody 2d in order to apply physics to our cake so now when we hit play we should see it fall to the ground cool the first component I want to have a look at is this surface effector if we go ahead and select our ground hit add component and add the surface effector 2d in order to use this we'll have to mark our Collider as used by a vector so what this component will now do is apply a force along the surface of the collider in order to match a specified speed think of the way a conveyor belt works at the airport so if we hit play now we should see that as soon as our ball hits the surface Air Force does indeed get applied and it slowly rolls along the surface we can decrease the speed here and actually make it go the other way we can also change the force scale this is the amount of force that we're going to add to our object in order to try and achieve the desired speed so if we set our speed to say 5 and bump up a force scale to 1 we should see that our ball immediately accelerates however if we set ours for scale to something smaller say point 0 1 we can see that it slowly increases in speed the speed variation allows us to add a random increase in speed we can also make this negative remember you can always control the collider in this component effects you do that by simply disabling a layer from the collider mask so if we didn't want this to affect water we would disable water and this is true to pretty much all of the effectors finally under options we have the possibility of using contact force this means that the force will be applied at the point of contact instead of at the center of the collider so if we enable this we should see that it very quickly rotates that's because the point of contact is always at the bottom of our sphere and so it's going to add torque because we are pushing at the bar my first fear and so we'll start to rotate around its center I'm just going to disable this for now and at the very bottom here you have two toggles design multiple of the effectors and they simply allow you to enable or disable friction and bounce from the physics material sitting on this object so next up is the area effector if you go ahead and rightclick hit create empty let's reset the transform on this object and call it something like force field we then add a new component the component we need is a box Collider 2d this is required by the area vector well then add the area effector itself again we'll have to check use by a vector and for this component we also want to mark the collider as a trigger so the area effector applies forces within a certain area and our area is defined by the size of our Collider so if we're going here and say scale up this component a bit and we can maybe also move it over to the right here we should now see that whenever our asteroid enters this field it's going to apply a force in the right direction and it's going to do so with a magnitude of 10 so if we hit play and see our asteroid fall to the ground you should see it speed up as soon as it gets to our area effector it did but it wasn't too visible we can go ahead and up the magnitude let's set it to 30 and we can also add an angle say if we wanted this area effector to have the ball shoot upwards well then we would go ahead and add the force angle of 90 degrees because if we move 90 degrees around the z axis it's going to shoot up so if we now hit play and wait for a meteor to enter the force field we can see that it gets shot up into the air this angle is currently relative to the orientation of our object so if we go ahead and rotate our force field along with the axis we should see that the direction in which our asteroid gets shot does also change if this is not what we want we check use global angle and so it will always get shot upwards there a vector also allows us to add some variation to our force and choose where we want to apply our force if it's set to rigidbody it's going to apply it at the center of mass of our rigidbody 2d and if we set it to Collider it's going to apply force to the current position of our Collider in our case that should mean the same because we're dealing with a totally circular object but for more complex objects that might make a difference finally we can also apply damping to a rigid body or in other words we can apply linear air resistance or rotational air resistance I very rarely find a use case for this next up is my personal favorite it's the point effector the point effect that apply as forces to either attract or repulse against a certain point note that I've set the gravity of an asteroid to zero so that it's just going to hang around in empty space in order to add a point effector we're actually going to have to add yet another Collider to this object yes you can have more than one circle Collider on an object so we'll add a circle Collider 2d and this one we're going to bump up the radius quite a bit that's because the radius here determines whether or not a nearby object is going to be affected by a point effector so let's make the reach of this fairly big we can then mark this as trigger and as used by effective let's then add a component and this is of course going to be the point effector now the force magnitude is of course the amount of force that we want to apply and this is negative if you want it to attract and positive if you want it to repulse if we go ahead and duplicate this asteroid now and move it over here and hit play we should see that that you very quickly clash together however the force that is being applied is currently constant meaning that as long as these two objects are within reach of each other we'll apply a constant force with a magnitude ten to each asteroid in the direction of the other asteroid this is fine for in many cases but when it comes to gravitational attraction as is the case between these two asteroids a good friend Newton actually stated that the force being applied to these is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them we call this law the law of universal gravitation and the relation between force and distance we call that inverse squared so if we want fairly realistic gravitational simulation that is what we would use though if I go ahead and apply that both our objects here we should see that the closer they get to each other the quicker they will accelerate we can then grab any of these asteroids here and you can see it's really quick and fun to play around with we can also duplicate one of them to introduce even more into the scene here and you can see how quickly you can get fairly realistic gravitational movement and it's really easy to go in here and tweak different parameters you could go in here and thumb up the mass on one of these objects so that is actually not going to have any effect on the force being applied so what you could do is increase the force magnitude together with the mass of the different objects and that would mean that the more heavier objects applied a great attraction or force to the audio objects as stated by Newton's law but if you want to learn more about this sort of stuff I suggest to check out my video on forces where we go a lot more in depth so just click the covers around the asteroid it's a bunch of times and I also made this ball here which is the exact same thing except it has a positive force magnitude now when we hit play we should see some of the objects here stick together and some of them are repelled

we want to add the buoyancy effector 2d we also want to mark our Collider as trigger and as used by effector and now right off the bat when we hit play it's actually going to look a whole lot better the two primary things that you want to adjust here is the surface level this is just the surface location of the buoyancy fluid so if we go ahead and subtract a bit from this you can see that our object will find rest at a lower point for example in this case I think it works a lot better if our surface level is actually a bit deeper and then we have the density of our fluid and without getting into a deep explanation of Newtonian fluids and fluid mechanics I will say that the more dense a fluid the easier it's going to be for objects to float on top you can see this as I raise the density of a fluid our asteroid will be pushed to the top and as I decrease it it will actually start sinking you can also see what happens if we have a very sudden shift in density the forces that are being applied are going to be so great that our asteroid will be shut up words finally a buoyancy effect it also allows us to adjust damping as we've seen before and even add flow along a surface this works in pretty much the exact same way as our area effector we have a magnitude which we can also use the control Direction an angle and a flow variation the final thing that I want to cover in this video is the platform effector this component applies various platform like behavior the most important one is probably oneway collisions I've set up this example here we have our asteroid sitting at ground level right on top of that we have a force field it's going to apply an upwards force making it jump upwards and we have a platform with the Box Collider 2d so right now we hit play and our asteroid gets shut up and it's going to hit the platform and it's not really going to get anywhere but a very common thing that you want to do in platformer games is give characters the possibility of jumping on top of platforms by first going through them and then landing on them and this is what we referred to as oneway collision to add this we're simply going here at the platform effector 2d we then want to check use by vector not as trigger this time and make sure that under the settings under oneway it says use oneway now when we hit play our asteroid should shoot right through the platform and land on top of it if we go into the scene view we can also see that we now have this arc on top of our platform this is adjusted using the surface arc and this arc basically just defines the surface that doesn't allow colliders to pass meaning that anything outside of the arc is considered for oneway collision in most cases this is just going to be 180 you can also use the rotational offset in case you want to flip things around if we set this to 180 now take our asteroid here and drag them up and have them fall down you can see that it now works in the opposite way and finally under sides here we can adjust whether or not we want to use side friction and side bounds this means that if we have some kind of physics material applied to our platform say we wanted to make this platform bouncy we can choose whether or not we want that to take effect when we hit the sides of the platform so let's go in here and create a physics material and let's call this one bouncy we can set the friction to point 4 that's fine and the bouncing is to 1 then under our platform that's going to box Collider 2d and drag in our bouncy material we should now see that when we hit play our platform is indeed bouncy but since use side bounces currently turned off if we just disable use one way here let's rotate the platform 90 degrees around the Z let's also move up our asteroid we shouldn't actually see bouncing and indeed it does not so use this component wisely it can definitely help you get around a lot of the annoying control stuff when making a quick 2d platformer let's pretty much it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did make sure to subscribe so don't miss thanks for watching now let's see you in the next video thanks to all the awesome
