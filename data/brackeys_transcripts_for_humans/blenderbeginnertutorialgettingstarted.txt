00:00 - if you want to learn blender this is the
00:01 - place to start in these videos we'll go
00:02 - over the basics of using blender from
00:04 - modeling to texturing to Lighting in
00:06 - this video we set up the interface learn
00:07 - to navigate around and create our first
00:09 - objects and by the end we make a monkey
00:11 - explode yeah welcome to 3D modeling all
00:13 - right so let's get into it so to
00:14 - download blender let's go to blender.org
00:16 - I'll have a link in the description as
00:18 - well that said download choose an
00:20 - operating system and choose a location
00:22 - closest to you in my case that's Denmark
00:24 - it's going to start downloading once
00:25 - it's done just open it up and run
00:27 - through the installer so let's open up
00:29 - blender the version that I'm using is
00:30 - 2.78 C but I don't expect the stuff will
00:33 - cover here to change anytime soon let's
00:34 - get rid of this opening window by
00:36 - clicking anywhere in the screen and
00:37 - welcome to blender not a lot of people
00:39 - find the interface to be really daunting
00:41 - at first don't worry as a beginner you
00:43 - won't be using 90% of the stuff you see
00:45 - here the primary thing that we're going
00:47 - to be focusing on is the 3D viewport
00:49 - that's the big one in the center here
00:51 - this is where we do all of our modeling
00:53 - where we change around objects and
00:54 - select them that means that this is
00:56 - where most of the creative stuff happens
00:58 - on the right here we have the properties
00:59 - panel this this is probably also the
01:00 - most scary one you'll notice just how
01:02 - many knobs and dials there are here this
01:04 - is used to modify things in our scene
01:06 - and some of the tabs modify the object
01:08 - that is currently selected in our case
01:09 - we have the cube selected so if we were
01:11 - to go to the materials panel and change
01:13 - the color of the material to let's say
01:15 - green we can see that that modifies our
01:18 - Cube but if we then select our camera we
01:20 - can see that the materials tab is gone
01:22 - because our camera does not have a
01:24 - material now let's undo that by hitting
01:26 - contrl z a couple times and some of you
01:28 - might have had a hard time selecting the
01:30 - camera here maybe this happened that's
01:32 - because blender is a bit different and
01:34 - doesn't use left click to select instead
01:36 - we use right click and left click just
01:39 - moves around our 3D cursor the 3D cursor
01:41 - is used for a few things mainly it's the
01:43 - place where we spawn new objects and it
01:45 - can be pretty annoying if you
01:46 - accidentally click somewhere and now
01:48 - everything you spawn is out here so to
01:50 - reset that you can always hit shift C
01:53 - and it's going to snap right back to the
01:55 - center of our scene now before we start
01:57 - changing things around let's go file use
01:59 - a preference
02:00 - and this is where we configure blender
02:01 - you will see a lot of people using a
02:03 - different theme if you go into themes
02:05 - and presets there are a bunch of
02:06 - different ones to choose from a very
02:08 - popular one is elisan but we'll just be
02:10 - using the default theme on the input we
02:12 - can adjust all of our keyboard shortcuts
02:14 - of which there are many by default you
02:16 - can leave everything as is but if you're
02:18 - using a keyboard without a number pad
02:19 - maybe on the laptop without one the
02:21 - number pad is the numbers to the right
02:23 - of your keyboard you will probably want
02:24 - to go ahead and check emulate numpad
02:27 - that's because we use the number pad a
02:28 - lot in blender when adjusting our view
02:30 - and checking this will allow you to use
02:31 - your normal number Keys instead also if
02:34 - you're really annoyed with having to
02:35 - right click to select you can change
02:37 - that preference here so now that we're
02:38 - satisfied with our settings let's hit
02:40 - save user settings to make sure that
02:42 - they will be there next time we open
02:43 - blender so let's have a look at how we
02:45 - can navigate around our view there are
02:46 - three main ways to move around in
02:48 - blender the first one is using our
02:50 - scroll wheel this will zoom in and out
02:52 - if you hold down the middle Mouse button
02:54 - and drag it will rotate around a certain
02:57 - Pivot Point this allows us to view our
02:58 - object from multiple sides and if we
03:00 - hold down shift and middle Mouse button
03:02 - we can pan around a scene so using these
03:05 - three different ways of movement we can
03:06 - quickly focus on different objects and
03:08 - if you quickly want to snap to a certain
03:10 - object you can always select it and hit
03:12 - period on the number pad to snap to it
03:14 - in fact if you get so lost that you
03:16 - can't even see your objects you can
03:18 - always go up here this is called the
03:20 - outliner and it shows all of the objects
03:22 - currently in our scene we can then click
03:24 - the object that we want to snap to and
03:26 - hit period and there we go the outliner
03:27 - can be really handy for selecting
03:29 - objects you can't see or hide objects
03:31 - that you don't want to focus on we can
03:33 - also use the number pad to quickly view
03:34 - our scene from different sides if we had
03:36 - seven we view it from above three from
03:39 - the side and one from the front however
03:42 - if we go ahead and pan to the side here
03:44 - you can see that we're still viewing
03:45 - things in perspective and this is
03:47 - sometimes a good thing but other times
03:48 - we actually just want to view things
03:50 - flat in the same way that an architect
03:52 - would draw out different sides of a
03:54 - building to do that we hit five this
03:56 - changes us into orthographic mode and it
03:59 - basically just removes perspective from
04:00 - our scene so now everything is going to
04:02 - be viewed flat and we can still view it
04:04 - from above the side and the front and we
04:07 - can even drag around here and still view
04:08 - things in autographic mode you can see
04:10 - up here which mode we're currently in if
04:12 - we hit five again we switch back to
04:14 - perspective this can of course be a bit
04:16 - confusing to the mind when you first get
04:18 - started but you'll quickly get used to
04:19 - switching between them and find out just
04:21 - how handy it is to be able to do that so
04:23 - now that we know how to navigate around
04:24 - our scene let's start doing things let's
04:26 - begin by selecting the camera holding
04:28 - down shift to select the light as well
04:30 - let's hit delete or X to remove it let's
04:32 - select our Cube and the first thing that
04:34 - we can do here is use the arrow keys to
04:36 - move it around our scene and E way to do
04:38 - this is simply hitting G for grab and we
04:40 - can now drag it around when dragging
04:41 - things in freehand like this it can be
04:43 - hard to get a grasp of where your object
04:45 - currently is in space so instead of
04:47 - really moving it it's normal to have it
04:49 - snap to a certain axis we can hit X to
04:51 - only move it around the x-axis Z to move
04:54 - it along the z-axis and Y to move it
04:56 - along the Y if we left click we go
04:59 - through with the move movement but if we
05:00 - right click it snaps back other than
05:02 - moving our object we can also rotate it
05:04 - to do that we hit R again we can rotate
05:06 - it in freehand or around the x z and y
05:09 - AIS and finally we can hit s to scale by
05:12 - default we scale on all axis around the
05:14 - center you've guessed it we can also
05:16 - choose to only scale on the X the Z and
05:18 - the Y so we can now manipulate objects
05:21 - the way that we want and so we can start
05:22 - building cool stuff if for example we
05:24 - were to delete this Cube hit shift a to
05:27 - bring up a menu this menu allows us to
05:29 - spawn objects into a scene there's a lot
05:31 - of different stuff here but what we are
05:32 - going to be working with is everything
05:34 - underneath the mesh Tab and these are
05:36 - basic Primitives that you can work off
05:38 - of let's begin by spawning in a cube
05:40 - here let's scale it down on the z-axis
05:42 - let's grab it and move it up on the
05:44 - z-axis as well let's then hit shift a
05:46 - and let's spawn in a cylinder let's
05:48 - scale this down quite a bit but scale it
05:50 - up on the z-axis we can then hit seven
05:53 - to view this from the top to get a
05:55 - better view we go down here this allows
05:56 - us to change from solid to wireframe
05:59 - mode and we can now see the cylinder
06:01 - through the cube we then hit grab to
06:03 - move it and let's move it to the edge
06:05 - here to duplicate an object we hit shift
06:07 - d and we can move this over to the right
06:10 - as well let's now select both of them by
06:12 - holding down shift and right clicking
06:14 - and let's duplicate both and move those
06:16 - down to the bottom if we now shift back
06:19 - into solid mode hit five to switch back
06:21 - to perspective we've created a table now
06:24 - there are about a million different
06:26 - things that we could do to make this
06:27 - cooler but you have to start somewhere
06:29 - and congratulations on your first model
06:31 - if the banding on the cylinders here is
06:33 - really annoying you you can select all
06:34 - of them and go up here and change the
06:36 - shading to smooth that should help sort
06:38 - that out if we now were to select all
06:40 - the objects and remove them and instead
06:42 - go ahead and add a monkey the monkey
06:45 - head here is blender history it's been
06:47 - there for so many years and it's been
06:49 - used for pretty much everything it's
06:50 - been blown up shattered and put into
06:52 - environments of All Sorts so you'll
06:54 - probably be seeing a lot of this guy
06:56 - let's just do something fun and go ahead
06:57 - and make him shatter to do that we hit
06:59 - space to bring up our search menu and
07:01 - this is a really cool part of blender if
07:03 - there's something that you don't
07:04 - remember the shortcut to or can't find
07:06 - in the menus or maybe you just get an
07:08 - idea of something that you want to do
07:09 - but don't know how try searching for it
07:11 - for example if we wanted to add a sphere
07:13 - we search for add sphere and you get
07:15 - options for the different spheres you
07:16 - can add if we hit add Uvis sphere boom
07:19 - there's a sphere in our scene but now we
07:20 - want to make this guy explode let's go
07:22 - in here and write explode that's an
07:24 - option called quick explode if now we go
07:26 - down here and hit play we can see him
07:28 - shattering this here is the animation
07:30 - window and you can scrub through to any
07:32 - point in time we won't be using this too
07:34 - much but it's cool to know about so I
07:36 - really encourage you to take what you've
07:37 - learned here and go completely nuts with
07:39 - it don't be afraid to change around
07:41 - dials and adjust knobs you can also mess
07:43 - around with the interface all that you
07:45 - want if you feel you get completely lost
07:47 - don't worry all you need to do to
07:48 - restore your settings is go back to file
07:50 - new and voila everything gets reset
07:53 - that's properties interface and
07:55 - everything you've done with your scene
07:56 - so go nuts and save often that's pretty
07:58 - much it for this video if you enjoyed it
08:00 - make sure to subscribe so you don't miss
08:01 - the next one I upload Sundays and
08:02 - Wednesdays also this is of course a bit
08:04 - different from my usual video normally I
08:06 - do tutorials on game development most of
08:08 - them on using my favorite piece of
08:10 - software which is Unity so if you're
08:11 - interested in game development I have a
08:13 - course here for complete beginners on to
08:15 - my loyal subscribers don't worry I'll
08:16 - still be doing plenty of unity tutorials
08:19 - other than that thanks for watching and
08:20 - I will see you in the next video thanks
08:22 - to all the awesome Patron supporters who
08:24 - donated in April and a special thanks to
08:26 - Derk heemskirk fac marifi James Kell

if you want to learn blender this is the place to start in these videos we'll go over the basics of using blender from modeling to texturing to Lighting in this video we set up the interface learn to navigate around and create our first objects and by the end we make a monkey explode yeah welcome to 3D modeling all right so let's get into it so to download blender let's go to blender.org I'll have a link in the description as well that said download choose an operating system and choose a location closest to you in my case that's Denmark it's going to start downloading once it's done just open
