00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to this video on
00:05 - making a multiplayer face in unity today
00:08 - we are going to be adding the ability
00:09 - for our players to host their own game
00:12 - so they will be able to go in and create
00:14 - a room using our own custom two UI so
00:16 - that's going to be super fun also if
00:19 - you've somehow been living under your
00:20 - rock I am now on patron that's because
00:23 - I've gone full time with Becky's and I
00:25 - really want to deliver as much content
00:27 - as possible but I am also human being
00:30 - and I have to eat and live and sleep and
00:33 - therefore I need some kind of way of
00:36 - making money through YouTube and ad
00:40 - revenue is really not a lot these days
00:43 - so if you want to support me in making
00:45 - as much content as possible for you guys
00:47 - you can go over to patreon it's a way
00:49 - for you to donate monthly and I offer
00:52 - some rewards in return and I will just
00:55 - show you what it looks like here so this
00:57 - is the patreon page you can go here and
00:59 - you can see some of the goals that I've
01:01 - set up and some of the reward tiers here
01:04 - and you can just click the become a
01:06 - patron button this if this is of course
01:08 - completely optional and you can choose a
01:10 - custom amount if you want or cash in one
01:12 - of the rewards here and you can pay with
01:15 - pretty much anything imaginable so a lot
01:19 - of thanks to the people who have already
01:20 - donated thank you to those of you who
01:22 - will maybe choose to donate after this
01:24 - video and without further ado let's just
01:27 - dig right into it alright so I'm here in
01:29 - unity and what I want to do is
01:31 - transition over to a lobby scene then I
01:33 - want to choose our network manager and
01:36 - add a new component called well host
01:38 - game and this is of course going to be a
01:40 - sea shard sharp
01:42 - script and I just want to separate this
01:45 - out from the network manager just to
01:48 - make things a bit easier to read because
01:50 - we could go ahead and do a custom
01:52 - network manager that had this
01:54 - functionality but I think it's easier to
01:56 - split this up especially because network
01:58 - code can often be a bit more confusing
02:01 - confusing than the usual so first off I
02:05 - want to be using unity engine dot
02:08 - networking so we have access to the
02:10 - function that we need when creating a
02:13 - game on the matchmaking on network so
02:16 - what we want to do here is just delete
02:18 - those functions for now and then we'll
02:20 - create a few variables the first one is
02:23 - going to store the amount of players
02:25 - that can be in our room so this is going
02:27 - to be the private and you would normally
02:30 - make this an integer but unity takes in
02:32 - au int it's just a slightly different
02:34 - data type that is a bit smaller so it
02:37 - takes in a private you end and then we
02:39 - call this room size and let's just
02:43 - default that to 6 you can pretty much go
02:46 - any size you want here as long as it's
02:48 - not ridiculously large of course and
02:50 - then we can have a private string which
02:54 - is going to be the room name and we want
02:57 - to set this using an input field that we
03:00 - create in our GUI you could go ahead and
03:01 - do that at the exact same thing with the
03:04 - room size but I'm just going to set that
03:06 - to a default value so far but again you
03:09 - should expand upon this if you want your
03:11 - game to have or if you want your players
03:13 - to be able to select how big their rooms
03:15 - could be you should definitely just make
03:18 - an input field for this and I'm going to
03:20 - show you the process right now so let's
03:22 - just for now mark this as a serialize
03:24 - field so we can change it in the
03:25 - inspector instead and just have that be
03:27 - constant then of course we need a way
03:30 - for us to change the room name and that
03:32 - is done by letting the input field call
03:35 - some kind of function that will then set
03:37 - the rule name equal to whatever the
03:40 - input field is equal to and we do this
03:42 - by making a public function because we
03:44 - need to access it from without the
03:46 - script or without the host game class
03:48 - and it's going to be a public void and
03:51 - it's going to be called said room name
03:54 - and we take in here a string with the
03:57 - name and this string name if set up
03:59 - correctly will be equal to the current
04:02 - odd text of the input field and so if we
04:06 - set our rule name equal to underscore
04:09 - name well then we will be setting rule
04:11 - name equal to whatever e is on the input
04:14 - field so that's perfect and you could do
04:16 - it the exact same thing with the room
04:18 - size as long as you may remember to pass
04:21 - it into some kind of integer so you need
04:25 - to
04:26 - I'll change the datatype there but we've
04:28 - done that before in other videos and
04:30 - it's just a quick look up if you haven't
04:32 - done that before so next up we can go
04:35 - ahead and make the actual method for
04:38 - creating a room so we are going to do a
04:40 - public void and this is again going to
04:42 - be public because we're going to call it
04:44 - from the button that we're going to be
04:46 - creating on the GUI and this is going to
04:48 - be the create room method and it takes
04:51 - in no arguments and first off we want to
04:53 - just make sure that our room name is
04:55 - valid so we want to say check if
04:58 - roommate room name is not equal to well
05:02 - just nothing and room name is not equal
05:06 - to no so it has actually been
05:08 - instantiated well then we can go ahead
05:12 - and make me make a debug deadlock
05:13 - statement just to let us know that we
05:15 - are creating a room and we can input the
05:20 - room name there and we can say with ah
05:25 - room 4 and then our room size and then
05:32 - players so it's going to say that we are
05:34 - creating some kind of room with a
05:35 - certain name with room for X amount of
05:37 - players so that's perfect and then we
05:40 - can go ahead and actually make a call
05:42 - here
05:42 - level create the room and in order to do
05:46 - this we need a reference to our network
05:47 - manager and this is very easy because on
05:50 - the network manager there is a static
05:53 - variable called the singleton and this
05:55 - this is are currently active network
05:58 - manager but for efficiency's sake we can
06:00 - go up here and we can cash this out so
06:03 - we can make a private network manager
06:06 - and call this one well network manager
06:10 - just with a non-capital n and then in
06:12 - our stat method what we can do is simply
06:14 - set network manager equal to network
06:17 - manager dot singleton and now we've
06:20 - cached that that just makes it a tiny
06:22 - bit more effective and what we can also
06:25 - do in the start method is that we can
06:27 - make sure that our matchmaker is enabled
06:30 - because right now if I just save this we
06:33 - shouldn't have any errors if I just look
06:35 - over this and hit play and of course we
06:38 - have our network manager harder
06:40 - here you can see that we first need to
06:41 - enable the matchmaker and then we are
06:44 - able to create an Internet match of find
06:46 - one and so on and that's what we need to
06:48 - do in code as well so in our start
06:50 - method we are going to just check if
06:52 - it's already enabled then we do that by
06:54 - asking if network manager whoops that
06:58 - was the wrong manager here so network
07:01 - manager dot um and it's match maker is
07:06 - equal to null that means that we haven't
07:09 - enabled it so we need to set in that
07:11 - case we need to do network manager that
07:13 - start match maker and that will just do
07:17 - the exact same thing as we just did
07:19 - through the unity GUI then next up we
07:22 - can create the room now we have a
07:23 - reference we know that our matchmaker is
07:26 - enabled so we can go ahead and create a
07:27 - room down here and we do this by simply
07:30 - saying network manager dot create or dot
07:34 - matchmaker dot create match and this
07:38 - takes in a whole bunch of parameters
07:40 - especially because the one we're going
07:42 - to be using is this one so let's take
07:44 - them one by one so the first one is the
07:46 - red the match name and we just want that
07:49 - to be real name then it's the match size
07:52 - we just want that to be of course room
07:54 - size then our the match advertise we
07:58 - need this to be true so we can discover
08:00 - it then the string match password this
08:04 - is just going to be empty for now
08:05 - however you can definitely go ahead and
08:08 - allow the user to choose a password just
08:11 - as we allow them to choose a name and
08:13 - you could allow them to choose a size so
08:15 - you could of course just input that
08:17 - there but I'm just going to leave this
08:19 - armed so we don't have any passwords and
08:21 - the last one is a callback function that
08:24 - means a function that is that you want
08:27 - to be called when a match is created and
08:30 - in our case we just want to call a
08:33 - function already set up on the network
08:36 - manager for this purpose so if we go in
08:39 - network manager dot on crew on match
08:43 - created is there we go and now we can
08:46 - close this off and this method here will
08:49 - now be called when a match is created we
08:51 - can now save this screen
08:53 - tripped and it should actually be
08:54 - working just fine
08:56 - so if we hit play it's going to be very
08:58 - non exciting but hopefully error-free so
09:01 - the play and yeah no errors but again
09:05 - nothing happens except that we can see
09:07 - that it has automatically enabled the
09:10 - match so what we need to do now is get a
09:13 - sketch out some kind of you I so if we
09:15 - go on a canvas here we have our image
09:18 - and that's fine and we can maybe go
09:20 - ahead and make me rename this to
09:22 - background and then we can right click
09:24 - go on the UI and maybe choose and ah I'm
09:29 - going to choose here actually let's do
09:31 - an empty object and just reset that and
09:33 - let's rename this to host game and let's
09:38 - ah drag that up here and size it to fit
09:42 - half of our screen and then let's alt or
09:46 - let's make it scale up and down on the
09:50 - center here so that when our screen is
09:52 - moved this way it will scale however it
09:55 - will not scale if we do this that's
09:57 - perfect and then what we can do here is
09:59 - add a vertical layout group and to under
10:05 - this vertical layout group we could add
10:06 - a text object so we're going to do UI
10:09 - text and sometimes when you add it
10:11 - indirectly it helps to just drag it out
10:14 - and drag it back in and then it will
10:15 - snap correctly I don't know why unity
10:17 - tell us that and then we can scale this
10:20 - up because we need it to be quite large
10:22 - maybe something like 32 we can change
10:24 - the color here to just a complete white
10:26 - for now you can of course mess around
10:28 - with this to make it more exciting then
10:30 - we can choose or change the text to our
10:35 - host game and we can maybe make this
10:38 - bold as well then let's Center this on
10:42 - the screen there and there we go and
10:44 - maybe something we could do as well is
10:47 - disable the height stretching and then
10:50 - on the layout group we can go here and
10:53 - select middle centers so all of the
10:56 - different object objects parented to
11:00 - this all of the children will be aligned
11:02 - to the center great so I think that's
11:05 - all
11:06 - we need to do for the text here and we
11:07 - can maybe rename this to host game title
11:10 - or text or whatever you want to do and
11:13 - we can right click on this and create
11:14 - another UI object and this is going to
11:16 - be an input field then we can just do
11:18 - the same thing here drag it out drag it
11:20 - back in and this is going to look very
11:22 - more bad from the beginning but we need
11:25 - to all we need to do is add a layout
11:27 - element component go under preferred
11:30 - height and change this to something
11:32 - larger like 40 or maybe 30 I think 30 is
11:37 - going to suit us fine here just a single
11:40 - line input field and what we can do here
11:43 - is maybe change this to the room name so
11:46 - we know what
11:47 - or maybe room name input actually so we
11:50 - know this is an input field then we can
11:52 - find under this our placeholder text and
11:55 - change this to our room name dot dot so
12:00 - the user know what to knows what to
12:03 - input and everything else on this
12:07 - placeholder looks fine maybe the last
12:10 - thing that we could do and you can of
12:11 - course change the day and layout on this
12:13 - any way you want the last thing that we
12:16 - need to do is go down here to websites
12:18 - on value changed and make sure that we
12:21 - call the method that we created for
12:23 - changing the name on the script so we
12:26 - actually just need to call this function
12:29 - here to make sure that our room name is
12:32 - changed whenever we change something on
12:34 - the input field so they will be synced
12:36 - up so let's go ahead and add a non value
12:38 - changed here and let's take our network
12:41 - manager and drag it in there and let's
12:44 - go down here and select host game and we
12:48 - want that too we want to select the set
12:50 - room name and that's going to be all
12:52 - Ally things so that's perfect
12:54 - and what we can do then is maybe just
12:57 - change the padding a bit here maybe just
13:00 - add 20 and 20 on the sides there so it
13:04 - doesn't scale and fill out the whole
13:07 - entire half of the screen so this is
13:10 - going to be fine and then we can add a
13:13 - button for joining the game so let's go
13:15 - UI button and let's drag again drag this
13:19 - out drag
13:20 - back in let's add a layout element a
13:22 - preferred hide of let's do 50 this time
13:25 - and we can change the text of this
13:28 - button to say join or create room and we
13:36 - can bump up the size to maybe 18 that
13:39 - all looks very fine and I actually don't
13:42 - think we need to edit this any further
13:45 - that's kind of all we need in here then
13:48 - we can rename the button to create room
13:52 - button and we can add down here and on
13:57 - click event and this is what will happen
13:59 - of course when we click the button and
14:02 - we can then drag in our network manager
14:04 - once again and select our network or our
14:07 - host game and select create room perfect
14:14 - so that's all we needed to do there then
14:16 - we can just for just make this look a
14:20 - bit better by on adding some spacing so
14:23 - I'm just going to add a spacing of 10
14:25 - here just to give it a bit more room on
14:28 - to this ah GUI and the great thing here
14:31 - is when we get ready for that in another
14:33 - video we can simply add another 1/2 over
14:35 - here that says join game and with all of
14:38 - the settings for that so that's going to
14:39 - be very easy or we could simply stretch
14:43 - this over and then simply enable them
14:45 - depending on what we choose so there -
14:49 - so there are many possibilities for
14:52 - using this and it's very easy to rescale
14:55 - it because of the vertical layout group
14:56 - so now if we go ahead and try this out
15:00 - so let's hit play and we can maybe type
15:03 - in a room name here and I'm going to
15:05 - type in test room and we are going to
15:08 - hit create room and we're going to wait
15:10 - for unity and now you can see here
15:12 - creating room test room with room for
15:14 - six players matchmaking client create so
15:18 - it makes a great match request and we
15:20 - get a JSON response that says success
15:23 - and then the our room was indeed created
15:26 - so now we are indeed available for other
15:29 - clients to join and for now we can just
15:32 - hit stop here to
15:33 - exit our room and other people will be
15:35 - able to join the room using on the
15:38 - temporary UI we have up here and next up
15:41 - of course we are going to be adding some
15:43 - functionality for joining rooms we're
15:46 - going to have some kind of list that we
15:48 - can go through to select the proper room
15:50 - and a refresh button button and all that
15:52 - so it's not actually that hard but it
15:55 - does take enough time that we need to do
15:57 - that in a separate video so I hope you
15:59 - enjoyed this one I definitely did and
16:01 - I'm looking forward to see you in the
16:03 - next video so thanks for watching and
16:05 - I'll see you soon so I'm going to start
16:08 - mentioning patreon supporters the
16:09 - following month after they donate so
16:12 - that there won't be any difference from
16:14 - donating at the beginning of the month
16:15 - to the end of the month this way
16:17 - everyone will get a full month of
16:19 - mentions and yeah everyone will be happy
16:22 - so just wait for the next month and you
16:25 - will see your name here so thanks for
16:27 - watching and I'll see you soon

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to this video on making a multiplayer face in unity today we are going to be adding the ability for our players to host their own game so they will be able to go in and create a room using our own custom two UI so that's going to be super fun also if you've somehow been living under your rock I am now on patron that's because I've gone full time with Becky's and I really want to deliver as much content as possible but I am also human being and I have to eat and live and sleep and therefore I need some kind of way of making money through YouTube and ad revenue is really not a lot these days so if you want to support me in making as much content as possible for you guys you can go over to patreon it's a way for you to donate monthly and I offer some rewards in return and I will just show you what it looks like here so this is the patreon page you can go here and you can see some of the goals that I've set up and some of the reward tiers here and you can just click the become a patron button this if this is of course completely optional and you can choose a custom amount if you want or cash in one of the rewards here and you can pay with pretty much anything imaginable so a lot of thanks to the people who have already donated thank you to those of you who will maybe choose to donate after this video and without further ado let's just dig right into it alright so I'm here in unity and what I want to do is transition over to a lobby scene then I want to choose our network manager and add a new component called well host game and this is of course going to be a sea shard sharp script and I just want to separate this out from the network manager just to make things a bit easier to read because we could go ahead and do a custom network manager that had this functionality but I think it's easier to split this up especially because network code can often be a bit more confusing confusing than the usual so

can create the room now we have a reference we know that our matchmaker is enabled so we can go ahead and create a room down here and we do this by simply saying network manager dot create or dot matchmaker dot create match and this takes in a whole bunch of parameters especially because the one we're going to be using is this one so let's take them one by one so the first one is the red the match name and we just want that to be real name then it's the match size we just want that to be of course room size then our the match advertise we need this to be true so we can discover it then the string match password this is just going to be empty for now however you can definitely go ahead and allow the user to choose a password just as we allow them to choose a name and you could allow them to choose a size so you could of course just input that there but I'm just going to leave this armed so we don't have any passwords and the last one is a callback function that means a function that is that you want to be called when a match is created and in our case we just want to call a function already set up on the network manager for this purpose so if we go in network manager dot on crew on match created is there we go and now we can close this off and this method here will now be called when a match is created we can now save this screen tripped and it should actually be working just fine so if we hit play it's going to be very non exciting but hopefully errorfree so the play and yeah no errors but again nothing happens except that we can see that it has automatically enabled the match so what we need to do now is get a sketch out some kind of you I so if we go on a canvas here we have our image and that's fine and we can maybe go ahead and make me rename this to background and then we can right click go on the UI and maybe choose and ah I'm going to choose here actually let's do an empty object and just reset that and let's rename this to host game and let's ah drag that up here and size it to fit half of our screen and then let's alt or let's make it scale up and down on the center here so that when our screen is moved this way it will scale however it will not scale if we do this that's perfect and then what we can do here is add a vertical layout group and to under this vertical layout group we could add a text object so we're going to do UI text and sometimes when you add it indirectly it helps to just drag it out and drag it back in and then it will snap correctly I don't know why unity tell us that and then we can scale this up because we need it to be quite large maybe something like 32 we can change the color here to just a complete white for now you can of course mess around with this to make it more exciting then we can choose or change the text to our host game and we can maybe make this bold as well then let's Center this on the screen there and there we go and maybe something we could do as well is disable the height stretching and then on the layout group we can go here and select middle centers so all of the different object objects parented to this all of the children will be aligned to the center great so I think that's all we need to do for the text here and we can maybe rename this to host game title or text or whatever you want to do and we can right click on this and create another UI object and this is going to be an input field then we can just do the same thing here drag it out drag it back in and this is going to look very more bad from the beginning but we need to all we need to do is add a layout element component go under preferred height and change this to something larger like 40 or maybe 30 I think 30 is going to suit us fine here just a single line input field and what we can do here is maybe change this to the room name so we know what or maybe room name input actually so we know this is an input field then we can find under this our placeholder text and change this to our room name dot dot so the user know what to knows what to input and everything else on this placeholder looks fine maybe the last thing that we could do and you can of course change the day and layout on this any way you want the last thing that we need to do is go down here to websites on value changed and make sure that we call the method that we created for changing the name on the script so we actually just need to call this function here to make sure that our room name is changed whenever we change something on the input field so they will be synced up so let's go ahead and add a non value changed here and let's take our network manager and drag it in there and let's go down here and select host game and we want that too we want to select the set room name and that's going to be all Ally things so that's perfect and what we can do then is maybe just change the padding a bit here maybe just add 20 and 20 on the sides there so it doesn't scale and fill out the whole entire half of the screen so this is going to be fine and then we can add a button for joining the game so let's go UI button and let's drag again drag this out drag back in let's add a layout element a preferred hide of let's do 50 this time and we can change the text of this button to say join or create room and we can bump up the size to maybe 18 that all looks very fine and I actually don't think we need to edit this any further that's kind of all we need in here then we can rename the button to create room button and we can add down here and on click event and this is what will happen of course when we click the button and we can then drag in our network manager once again and select our network or our host game and select create room perfect so that's all we needed to do there then we can just for just make this look a bit better by on adding some spacing so I'm just going to add a spacing of 10 here just to give it a bit more room on to this ah GUI and the great thing here is when we get ready for that in another video we can simply add another 1/2 over here that says join game and with all of the settings for that so that's going to be very easy or we could simply stretch this over and then simply enable them depending on what we choose so there so there are many possibilities for using this and it's very easy to rescale it because of the vertical layout group so now if we go ahead and try this out so let's hit play and we can maybe type in a room name here and I'm going to type in test room and we are going to hit create room and we're going to wait for unity and now you can see here creating room test room with room for six players matchmaking client create so it makes a great match request and we get a JSON response that says success and then the our room was indeed created so now we are indeed available for other clients to join and for now we can just hit stop here to exit our room and other people will be able to join the room using on the temporary UI we have up here and next up of course we are going to be adding some functionality for joining rooms we're going to have some kind of list that we can go through to select the proper room and a refresh button button and all that so it's not actually that hard but it does take enough time that we need to do that in a separate video so I hope you enjoyed this one I definitely did and I'm looking forward to see you in the next video so thanks for watching and I'll see you soon so I'm going to start mentioning patreon supporters the following month after they donate so that there won't be any difference
