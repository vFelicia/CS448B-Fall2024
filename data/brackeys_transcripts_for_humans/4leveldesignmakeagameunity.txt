00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to video number
00:06 - four in make a game a cool series on
00:10 - making a video game in unity so as
00:13 - always I've opened up the unity and what
00:16 - we're going to be doing today is we're
00:18 - going to expand on our levels so right
00:21 - now it's really boring we only have one
00:23 - cube for our sphere to stand on and jump
00:27 - upon so we are going to make multiple of
00:30 - those we're also going to add a skybox
00:32 - and we are also going to add textures to
00:36 - our objects so I'm going to talk about
00:38 - what materials are what textures are
00:40 - maybe even shaders and such so basically
00:44 - all the visual stuff is coming along now
00:48 - so beautiful let's get started so open
00:53 - up our level 1 scene here and let's
00:56 - first of all create a folder for our
00:58 - script so that what our project won't
01:01 - get all filled up so right click in our
01:04 - project pane hit create and then folder
01:08 - and let's name this script and drag our
01:13 - two scripts onto there cool now let's
01:17 - start out by importing a texture so
01:21 - basically what a texture is is an image
01:26 - that we wrap around our object so let me
01:29 - just open up Photoshop here and show you
01:32 - what it is I mean so we have our ball we
01:35 - have a ball object here woops they're
01:39 - trying to draw a ball it's not
01:41 - succeeding very well but that's ok so we
01:45 - have a sphere standing on our cube and
01:49 - on each object in unity we have a few
01:54 - different things attached you know we
01:56 - have a a controller object a rigidbody
02:00 - that pushes our sphere around so we have
02:03 - a rigidbody and we also have a
02:06 - controller script that allows us to move
02:10 - it and all of these are again
02:13 - odd components but there are also some
02:17 - components that allow us to change the
02:20 - look of things and one of these are
02:24 - called a material so we go down here and
02:27 - this is just shortened by mats so we
02:30 - have a material and on a material
02:34 - basically this stores information on how
02:38 - we want our object to look and it stores
02:40 - a few things so basically it stores
02:43 - first of all it stores a texture a
02:48 - texture and a texture is an image and
02:52 - it's what we are going to use to overlay
02:54 - our objects so we are going to wrap the
02:57 - image around the object just like when
03:00 - you take a bowl and a piece of paper and
03:02 - you fold it around the bowl that's what
03:05 - it takes to does and that allows us to
03:07 - add detail the material also contains
03:11 - properties like shaders and shaders are
03:16 - sometimes hard to understand for
03:18 - beginners but basically what they do is
03:20 - they tell our material how it should be
03:23 - affected by light so if we have a light
03:27 - emitting and it hits the material we can
03:29 - say whether or not it should be
03:31 - reflective like a mirror or whether or
03:34 - not it should go right through so that
03:35 - the material becomes transparent or if
03:40 - it should be diffuse and also it stores
03:43 - information about what kinds of textures
03:46 - you want to attach because there's there
03:48 - are other than image textures there are
03:51 - image textures image textures but there
03:55 - are also stuff like bump maps which we
04:00 - will get into to like make our game look
04:03 - even better or normal Maps as they are
04:07 - also called normal Maps so it's really
04:13 - the game object is what stores
04:15 - everything under there we have a
04:17 - material which does all the visual stuff
04:19 - under there we have a texture which is
04:21 - the image and a shader which defines how
04:23 - light hits it's that that's basically
04:26 - it's so now that we have the explanation
04:29 - out of the way let's go ahead and
04:30 - actually apply this so here we see the
04:33 - mesh renderer and you can see it has a
04:36 - material called default diffuse so if we
04:38 - go scroll down and this is the material
04:41 - this is the default diffuse that's the
04:44 - material we're going to make a new one
04:46 - because we don't want to use the default
04:48 - one so let's right-click hit create and
04:52 - this is in our project pane hit create
04:54 - and then let's select material and let's
04:58 - call this ball wooden ball wood let's
05:04 - call it that and up here we now have a
05:08 - bunch of settings but before we go ahead
05:11 - and play around with this too much
05:13 - let's first apply to the ball but let me
05:15 - just change the main color to something
05:18 - darker so we can see being applied so
05:21 - basically what we can do is we can
05:23 - simply drag the material onto the ball
05:26 - and you can hold it over different
05:27 - objects and see it affecting them but
05:29 - just drag it onto the ball or if this is
05:32 - not working you can select the ball go
05:34 - into the mesh renderer materials and
05:37 - then drag it in there like that it's the
05:41 - same effect you'll get now we can see
05:44 - the material applied and once again we
05:46 - can select our ball and change settings
05:49 - here at the button or we can select the
05:52 - material and change settings there it
05:54 - will do exactly the same there won't be
05:57 - any difference
05:58 - I like selecting it in the project pane
06:01 - because then you won't get this grid and
06:04 - axis and Collider information and all
06:07 - that in the way cool so what we want to
06:10 - do is we want to make the color all
06:11 - white again you can also make it red and
06:14 - others but we're going to be applying a
06:16 - texture this one so we won't be needing
06:20 - the color too much you can see up here
06:23 - you have a property called shader and
06:25 - here you can you have a lot of options
06:28 - this won't make a lot of sense at the
06:31 - beginning the ones you're going to be
06:33 - using the most are called diffuse and
06:36 - specular shaders the difference is that
06:39 - it diffused
06:40 - reflects light just like wood does where
06:45 - a specular shader has this little glow
06:48 - effect this shininess which would be
06:52 - more common in stuff like metal in metal
06:55 - surfaces so now we're going to select
06:57 - the fuse and now we're going to add a
07:00 - texture but first we need to import it
07:02 - into unity so close down unity and here
07:06 - I found two nice shaders off of the CG
07:11 - textures comm a really nice website for
07:15 - finding free textures as long as you
07:17 - don't claim it's yours and then you can
07:20 - go ahead and use it also commercially
07:22 - which means you can make money off of
07:23 - games you make with these textures so
07:26 - it's a great website but if you don't
07:28 - want to find them and such you can just
07:30 - go to our website brackish comm and then
07:33 - this slider here should say make a game
07:37 - if not you can go into projects and then
07:41 - select mega game and here you can
07:42 - download the scripts and assets use that
07:46 - includes textures so it will be in the
07:48 - pack so that's awesome
07:50 - then go ahead and get it there and also
07:53 - it supports me a lot whenever you do
07:55 - that so it would be hugely recommended
07:58 - now let's finally humor the texture Wow
08:03 - the rough wood we are going to select
08:05 - that drag it into unity just drag it in
08:08 - there onto the project pane and release
08:11 - and now we have it imported it was that
08:14 - easy just to make sure we have the
08:16 - settings set right selected hit texture
08:20 - and then we are going to do yeah these
08:25 - these settings are just fine the many of
08:28 - these textures are completely ready for
08:30 - games already so you don't have to tweak
08:33 - anything also by the way unit is soon
08:37 - releasing a 2d version oh it's going to
08:40 - be in the same program but they are
08:42 - going to have to do features so if you
08:44 - are suddenly seeing that this is called
08:46 - sprites and that textures it's because
08:49 - you have set your project to be a 2d
08:52 - project so
08:53 - once you're creating it you should
08:55 - select that it should be a 3d project
08:58 - but you can change all of it after don't
09:01 - worry just hit Google and and there will
09:03 - be an explanation on how to do that so
09:06 - that's just for covering up Christians
09:09 - in the future now let's continue again
09:11 - so hit the ball ok hit apply to this and
09:15 - nevermind that error hit the ball and
09:18 - now let's drag on the texture oops
09:21 - what happened there oops I dragged it
09:24 - under the script folder that was not on
09:26 - purpose let's drag it onto the ball here
09:29 - waist it's none texture you can also hit
09:33 - here to select it
09:34 - yeah so let's select that and now we can
09:37 - see the texture applied to the ball
09:39 - beautifully so this looks really good
09:43 - what we can do now is we can play around
09:45 - with the tiling so if we want it to be a
09:48 - little wider or a little smaller in some
09:51 - axis we can use what is called tiling so
09:54 - let's select the material in the project
09:56 - pane and let's try to make our X 2 for
10:00 - example that is a little better that
10:03 - means that we'll make two copies along
10:06 - the x-axis we can also try three that's
10:10 - a little too much please play around
10:13 - with this value we can also make take
10:15 - our Y and maybe make it 0.5 and that
10:19 - might be good because we are looking at
10:21 - it from a distance we can go ahead and
10:23 - building the game view maybe not go
10:26 - ahead and please play around with these
10:28 - values we can try 0.2 and one that
10:32 - doesn't look too great either let's just
10:35 - go with the two and one there great so
10:41 - now that we have that set up let's go
10:43 - and hit our cube and let's now or our
10:48 - ground and let's now import the texture
10:50 - for that so let's head out here hit the
10:54 - medieval bricks drag it in just like the
10:57 - other one and release and make sure it's
11:00 - set to texture and this again looks just
11:02 - fine
11:03 - so what we can do now is we can make a
11:05 - texture for the ground so
11:07 - click create material or we can make a
11:11 - material I mean and then let's call this
11:13 - ground bricks and now we can drag on our
11:22 - middle evil bricks to that and then drag
11:25 - on the material onto the cube and you
11:28 - can see this looks all kinds of weird so
11:31 - what we're going to do is we're going to
11:32 - adjust the tiling and I'm going to guess
11:35 - that the x-axis need to be bumped up a
11:38 - lot so let's try five and it already
11:41 - looks much better
11:42 - let's try seven maybe and yeah that's
11:45 - not too bad what we can do is we can
11:48 - select our cube and we can see that our
11:51 - scale on the X is 10 and our scale on
11:54 - the Y is 1 so what we can then do is we
11:56 - can go back onto the material and hit
11:58 - and make sure the ratio is 10 to 1 and
12:02 - now it will look better but again these
12:04 - bricks are really small so instead we
12:06 - can make it 5 to 1/2 still keeping the
12:09 - same ratio this actually looks pretty
12:12 - cool in game also so please again play
12:16 - around with the values until you are
12:18 - satisfied and you don't have to use
12:21 - these textures you can find some of your
12:24 - on your own of course so it's completely
12:26 - up to you I'm just going to try playing
12:29 - around with this tiling option again
12:31 - just can't seem to get it quite right
12:34 - that is a little better I think and that
12:38 - was one and 0.5 so now that we have
12:43 - these textures set up we can go ahead
12:46 - and a expand a little bit on our level
12:50 - let's just also quickly add a skybox so
12:54 - we're just going to quickly go ahead and
12:56 - hit the right click in the project pane
13:00 - hit create and now I'm sorry not create
13:04 - but import package and then we should
13:08 - see sky boxes there and these are just
13:11 - some default sky boxes made by unity
13:13 - available if you don't have some you've
13:17 - made yourself so these are really great
13:20 - just
13:20 - voids all of that and it will just take
13:24 - a second for unity to import it and we
13:30 - should see a folder called standard
13:31 - assets and under this we have Skype
13:34 - access and here we go a whole lot of sky
13:37 - boxes now we can select our main camera
13:41 - this is where we put on our skybox and
13:44 - we want to add a new component and we
13:46 - want to add a skybox component so click
13:49 - Add component go in the rendering and
13:52 - hit skybox and what we can do now is we
13:55 - can drag in one of these make sure
13:57 - you're dragging the whole skybox and not
13:59 - one of the textures under the textures
14:01 - folder but the whole one so in the main
14:04 - camera we can also select this one and
14:06 - you can select different materials you
14:08 - can also select the one we've made
14:09 - ourselves so watch out for that that's
14:12 - not something you want to do I'm just
14:14 - going to try and drag in our sunny -
14:16 - let's try with that one and you won't
14:18 - see it in the scene view but as soon as
14:20 - soon as we shift to the game view we can
14:23 - see the beautiful skybox applied and
14:26 - that actually doesn't look too bad I'm
14:29 - just going to try a few different ones I
14:31 - like the sunny - that was a great guess
14:33 - and now when we play our game and looks
14:36 - very very much better so this is a lot
14:41 - more exciting we're also going to be
14:43 - expanding on lighting making that look
14:46 - more cool foreground background so
14:48 - objects a lot of stuff to play around
14:51 - with now that we have the scripting in
14:52 - place or leads at least the beginning of
14:56 - it and yeah so let's just quickly throw
14:59 - around some objects in our scene and
15:01 - then that much must be the ending of
15:03 - this video because we've been going on
15:05 - for quite a while
15:07 - great so what we're going to do now is
15:10 - we are going to make a prefab out of the
15:13 - ground what a prefab is is a genius
15:16 - thing unity of made it allows us to make
15:19 - our object into a shared object it
15:24 - basically means that we can change we
15:26 - can have a lot of ground objects all
15:28 - over our scene and then we can change
15:30 - one of them then hit apply and it will
15:34 - in fact all of the different objects so
15:36 - that allows us to quickly make changes
15:38 - to various objects scattered around our
15:41 - scene so now we can just go ahead and
15:43 - select our ground object and drag it
15:46 - down to the project pane and hit release
15:48 - and now it has automatically created
15:50 - what is called a prefab you can see that
15:53 - the ground object in the hierarchy has
15:56 - changed to blue and now we can just go
15:59 - ahead and duplicate this or drag in the
16:01 - prefab from the project panes to make
16:05 - another one and we can just drag it over
16:07 - and upwards
16:08 - or change the position variables over
16:11 - here and now we can start to shape our
16:13 - game by just simply duplicating here by
16:16 - hitting shift D or ctrl D that is and
16:20 - command D if you're on a Mac and then
16:22 - just rotating and scaling and adjusting
16:26 - these to however you want them and what
16:28 - now when we hit play we have a level
16:32 - mate which we can play and enjoy and
16:35 - this needs some adjustment so we can
16:37 - just go ahead and drag these two objects
16:40 - down a bit like that and remember
16:44 - whenever you are scaling and adjusting
16:46 - objects it's a good idea to keep track
16:49 - of whether or not you're using the local
16:52 - or global position up here in the left
16:55 - hand side this will this means that if
16:57 - we rotate our object it can either
17:01 - orient itself through the new rotation
17:03 - so we can drag it down this way or we
17:06 - can make it global so we can drag it
17:08 - straight down so that's a a great thing
17:12 - to switch between whenever you want to
17:14 - move these two down for example we
17:17 - probably want to do it using the global
17:20 - transform so we can move them uniformly
17:23 - okay so now let's play our game again
17:26 - and see if we can make this jump we made
17:30 - it and we can roll up this hill and
17:35 - please play around with it and we can
17:38 - also adjust the scale this is where the
17:40 - game design comes in and it becomes a
17:43 - lot of fun you can also duplicate the
17:45 - lights the possibilities are in the
17:47 - so that's pretty much the ending of this
17:49 - video I hope you enjoyed this enjoyed it
17:53 - and I'll see you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to video number four in make a game a cool series on making a video game in unity so as always I've opened up the unity and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to expand on our levels so right now it's really boring we only have one cube for our sphere to stand on and jump upon so we are going to make multiple of those we're also going to add a skybox and we are also going to add textures to our objects so I'm going to talk about what materials are what textures are maybe even shaders and such so basically all the visual stuff is coming along now so beautiful let's get started so open up our level 1 scene here and let's first of all create a folder for our script so that what our project won't get all filled up so right click in our project pane hit create and then folder and let's name this script and drag our two scripts onto there cool now let's start out by importing a texture so basically what a texture is is an image that we wrap around our object so let me just open up Photoshop here and show you what it is I mean so we have our ball we have a ball object here woops they're trying to draw a ball it's

that that's basically it's so now that we have the explanation out of the way let's go ahead and actually apply this so here we see the mesh renderer and you can see it has a material called default

hit create and this is in our project pane hit create and then let's select material and let's call this ball wooden ball wood let's call it that and up here we now have a bunch of settings but before we go ahead and play around with this too much let's first apply to the ball but let me just change the main color to something darker so we can see being applied so basically what we can do is we can simply drag the material onto the ball and you can hold it over different objects and see it affecting them but just drag it onto the ball or if this is not working you can select the ball go into the

and axis and Collider information and all that in the way cool so what we want to do is we want to make the color all white again you can also make it red and others but we're going to be applying a

little glow effect this shininess which would be more common in stuff like metal in metal surfaces so now we're going to select the fuse and now we're going to add a texture but first we need to

go to our website brackish comm and then this slider here should say make a game if not you can go into projects and then select mega game and here you can download the scripts and assets use that includes textures so it will be in the pack so that's awesome then go ahead and get it there and also it supports me a lot whenever you do that so it would be hugely recommended now let's finally humor the texture Wow the rough wood we are going to select that drag it into unity just drag it in there onto the project pane and release and now we have it imported it was that easy just to make sure we have the settings set right selected hit texture and then we are going to do yeah these these settings are just fine the many of these textures are completely ready for games already so you don't have to tweak anything also by the way unit is soon releasing a 2d version oh it's going to be in the same program but they are going to have to do features so if you are suddenly seeing that this is called sprites and that textures it's because you have set your project to be a 2d project so once you're creating it you should select that it should be a 3d project but you can change all of it after don't worry just hit Google and and there will be an explanation on how to do that so that's just for covering up Christians in the future now let's continue again so hit the ball ok hit apply to this and nevermind that error hit the ball and now let's drag on the texture oops what happened there oops I dragged it under the script folder that was not on purpose let's drag it onto the ball here waist it's none texture you can also hit here to select it yeah so let's select that and now we can see the texture applied to the ball beautifully so this looks really good what we can do now is we can play around with the tiling so if we want it to be a little wider or a little smaller in some axis we can use what is called tiling so let's select the material in the project pane and let's try to make our X 2 for example that is a little better that means that we'll make two copies along the xaxis we can also try three that's a little too much please play around with this value we can also make take our Y and maybe make it 0.5 and that might be good because we are looking at it from a distance we can go ahead and building the game view maybe not go ahead and please play around with these values we can try 0.2 and one that doesn't look too great either let's just go with the two and one there great so now that we have that set up let's go and hit our cube and let's now or our ground and let's now import the texture for that so let's head out here hit the medieval bricks drag it in just like the other one and release and make sure it's set to texture and this again looks just fine so what we can do now is we can make a texture for the ground so click create material or we can make a material I mean and then let's call this ground bricks and now we can drag on our middle evil bricks to that and then drag on the material onto the cube and you can see this looks all kinds of weird so what we're going to do is we're going to adjust the tiling and I'm going to guess that the xaxis need to be bumped up a lot so let's try five and it already looks much better let's try seven maybe and yeah that's not too bad what we can do is we can select our cube and we can see that our scale on the X is 10 and our scale on the Y is 1 so what we can then do is we can go back onto the material and hit and make sure the ratio is 10 to 1 and now it will look better but again these bricks are really small so instead we can make it 5 to 1/2 still keeping the same ratio this actually looks pretty cool in game also so please again play around with the values until you are satisfied and you don't have to use these textures you can find some of your on your own of course so it's completely up to you I'm just going to try playing around with this tiling option again just can't seem to get it quite right that is a little better I think and that was one and 0.5 so now that we have these textures set up we can go ahead and a expand a little bit on our level let's just also quickly add a skybox so we're just going to quickly go ahead and hit the right click in the project pane hit create and now I'm sorry not create but import package and then we should see sky boxes there and these are just some default sky boxes made by unity available if you don't have some you've made yourself so these are really great just voids all of that and it will just take a second for unity to import it and we should see a folder called standard assets and under this we have Skype access and here we go a whole lot of sky boxes now we can select our main camera this is where we put on our skybox and we want to add a new component and we want to add a skybox component so click Add component go in the rendering and hit skybox and what we can do now is we can drag in one of these make sure you're dragging the whole skybox and not one of the textures under the textures folder but the whole one so in the main camera we can also select this one and you can select different materials you can also select the one we've made ourselves so watch out for that that's not something you want to do I'm just going to try and drag in our sunny let's try with that one and you won't see it in the scene view but as soon as soon as we shift to the game view we can see the beautiful skybox applied and that actually doesn't look too bad I'm just going to try a few different ones I like the sunny that was a great guess and now when we play our game and looks very very much better so this is a lot more exciting we're also going to be expanding on lighting making that look more cool foreground background so objects a lot of stuff to play around with now that we have the scripting in place or leads at least the beginning of it and yeah so let's just quickly throw around some objects in our scene and then that much must be the ending of this video because we've been going on for quite a while great so what we're going to do now is we are going to make a prefab out of the ground what a prefab is is a genius thing unity of made it allows us to make our object into a shared object it basically means that we can change we can have a lot of ground objects all over our scene and then we can change one of them then hit apply and it will in fact all of the different objects so that allows us to quickly make changes to various objects scattered around our scene so now we can just go ahead and select our ground object and drag it down to the project pane and hit release and now it has automatically created what is called a prefab you can see that the ground object in the hierarchy has changed to blue and now we can just go ahead and duplicate this or drag in the prefab from the project panes to make another one and we can just drag it over and upwards or change the position variables over here and now we can start to shape our game by just simply duplicating here by hitting shift D or ctrl D that is and command D if you're on a Mac and then just rotating and scaling and adjusting these to however you want them and what now when we hit play we have a level mate which we can play and enjoy and this needs some adjustment so we can just go ahead and drag these two objects down a bit like that and remember whenever you are scaling and adjusting objects it's a good idea to keep track of whether or not you're using the local or global position up here in the left hand side this will this means that if we rotate our object it can either orient itself through the new rotation so we can drag it down this way or we can make it global so we can drag it straight down so that's a a great thing to switch between whenever you want to move these two down for example we probably want to do it using the global transform so we can move them uniformly okay so now let's play our game again and see if we can make this jump we made it and we can roll up this hill and please play around with it and we can also adjust the scale this is where the game design comes in and it becomes a lot of fun you can also duplicate the lights the possibilities are in the so that's pretty much the ending of this video I hope you enjoyed this enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one
