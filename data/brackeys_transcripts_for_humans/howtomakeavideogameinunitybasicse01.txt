With timestamps:

00:00 - So here's the step by step guide on getting started with your first video game.
00:03 - What you see on the screen now is what we're going to be making through this miniseries.
00:06 - It's really simple and Arcad(ey) but it's always easy to add more gameplay elements and cooler graphics at a later point.
00:11 - Right now, let's just jump into it.
00:13 - Let's begin by installing unity. If you've already done so you can just skip ahead in the video.
00:16 - First we need to go to unity3d.com
00:19 - When we're here, we're going to click "Get unity now."
00:21 - And we can see all of the different versions of unity. Unless you're a really experienced developer and working in a team.
00:27 - I definitely just recommend the personal version you can see that it comes with all engine features all platforms
00:32 - Updates, and it's Solely royalty-free
00:34 - So you can use it even to create commercial games the other stuff here is mostly some in the cloud
00:39 - Features and of course the ability to customize your splash screen
00:42 - So let's go ahead and hit download now let's also download the installer
00:45 - And it should be very similar on both windows and Mac go ahead and open the file
00:49 - You just download it so that guess and then we can just skip through the installer
00:53 - I'm going to choose 64-bit if you want a newer computer. You should do the same [and] this here is really neat
00:58 - This is our shoot to customize what parts of unity that you want to [download] because unity might be fairly large
01:03 - I recommend you download unity the documentation the standard assets if you're on the windows definitely check out
01:09 - Microsoft visual Studio tools for unity this will give you a much better text editor
01:13 - Then you can of course choose the platforms that you want to export to I'm just going to select Mac and web Pl
01:18 - We'll just go next choose the folder to install to and it's going to download unity and install for you
01:26 - Let's take a while. Let's hit finish so you can see I'm using genetic [5.5]
01:29 - Which is currently the newest version, but don't worry unity rarely changes things really dramatically
01:34 - so now we can just hit new to create a new project and a unity project is basically just a place to host all of
01:39 - Our code and acid, it's pretty much our entire game before you build it
01:43 - Let's give it a name and here. You can decide whether you want to build a 3D or 2D game however
01:48 - This is pretty much
01:49 - Just [going] to change the few settings inside of unity that we can change at a later point really really easily so this decision here
01:55 - Doesn't matter too much for now. Let's [just] keep that 3D
01:58 - Let's pick a location for a project and hit create
02:01 - So is what unity looks like right when you open it up, you'll notice that I have a dark skin for unity
02:06 - That's because I'm using a paid version, but other than the color of the editor
02:09 - That's not going to make any difference
02:10 - [throughout] the videos, so let's begin by exploring the user interface, so in the Middle here
02:15 - We have this scene view you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out you can use the middle mouse button
02:19 - To pan around and if we hold down alt and left-click we can then pivot around the center of our view over here
02:25 - We have the hierarchy this displays all the different game objects that we have in our scene
02:29 - You can see here our scene is currently untitled
02:31 - and it has two game objects the main camera [and] the
02:35 - Directional light notice that when I click on an object say the main camera the inspector will display
02:40 - Properties for that up here each one of these collapsible things here are called components components are what makes objects do different things
02:48 - But we'll get into that in a second you also have the project panel down [here] which shows all of our different game assets that
02:53 - We can then drag into our scene making them [appear] [in] the hierarchy you can totally rearrange
02:57 - Unity in any way that you would like and drag around panels and really go creative with this
03:02 - But remember you can always go to the top right corner and select
03:05 - Default and it's going to reopen to the default layout and any window you don't already have open you can go to window and select
03:12 - It from here, so let's start building our game first off
03:15 - We want to create a ground plane for a player [to] stand on to do that
03:18 - Let's go over to the Hierarchy [right] click
03:20 - You can also go [into] create and select 3D objects keep this spawns a new cube into our scene again
03:26 - We can use the movement controls to have a look at it
03:28 - We can always click the focus on it by hovering over the scene view
03:31 - Selecting it and hitting f now the cube currently is somewhere in our scene
03:35 - [and] it's really hard to get a look at where so what we'll do is
03:39 - Just go over to the transform here, right click and hit reset and that just centers it you can see the position [is] now
03:45 - We're on the x 0 and the y and so you're on the set and gives it a scale of one by one by one
03:51 - Again [hit] f to focus on it
03:52 - So if we go into a game view we can now see our cube through our camera if we want we can take our game
03:57 - View here and dock it to the right so that we can see both our scene and the game view at the same time then
04:03 - We can take our camera here, and we can readjust its position and you can see that updating in real time
04:09 - I'm just going to press ctrl z to undo that and then going to select the cube and scale it up
04:13 - Let's give it a scale of 15 on the x we keep it at 1 on the y and give it say
04:18 - 100 on the z if we zoom out now we can see just how huge this ground plane
04:22 - We can then go and rename it to ground and we can simply drag on the blue arrow
04:26 - Here to move it over something like that
04:28 - [just] so it starts about at the same point as our camera, then let's create another object
04:33 - So [right-click] go 3d object and then cube again let's reset the transform so it's centered on the scene
04:40 - We can then drag on this green arrow to move it up
04:43 - [let's] again hit f to focus on it, and we can see that
04:45 - We now have [our] new Cube here standing on the ground this cube is going to be a player
04:50 - So let's go ahead and rename him to player and it's also make him a bit more visible because right now everything is pretty boring
04:56 - White to do that
04:57 - We need to assign a material to our player
04:59 - And we create a new material in the project panel let's right click down [here]
05:03 - Go create and then material will name this material our player and then matt foreign material, but that's optional that's it enter now
05:11 - We can adjust different properties on this material stuff like how
05:14 - Metallic it should be the smoothness of the material and the color up here
05:18 - So we'll make this some kind of bright [red] and what we can do is then simply drag our player [matte]?
05:23 - Onto our Cube
05:24 - And you can see it
05:25 - Updating in real-time [so] simply let go and it's applied and any changes that we now make to this material are going to update
05:32 - For our player. I think our camera is a bit far [away], so let's also select our camera and move it a bit closer
05:38 - Again, we can move it over by simply dragging on this arrow
05:41 - Move it up a little bit and that looks a lot better
05:44 - So now if we were [to] hit play and actually run our game not much happens
05:49 - That's mostly because we haven't done any [programming] yet, and so we can't really control the player
05:53 - But we also need to add some physics into a game right now if we exit play mode take our player
05:58 - Drag him up here, and hit play again. He's just [going] to float in the air
06:02 - He's not falling down [the] reason why is that we need to tell this game object to interact with the unity physics system to do
06:08 - That we go out of play mode and add a new component in our case. We want to add the physics
06:14 - Rigidbody component
06:16 - Now when we hit play we should see that our cube falls to the ground and indeed
06:20 - It does right now it falls in a bit boring way
06:22 - So let's try and rotate our cube a bit to make [it] more interesting to do that
06:26 - We switch to the rotation tool notice how all of the different tools are up here right now. We have the move tool [selected]
06:32 - We can also shift to rotate scale
06:35 - And then this one is [for] manipulating 2D graphics which allows you to easily do all of the different [things] at the same time [you]
06:41 - Can always switch between these really quickly by using?
06:43 - Q
06:44 - w R and t so we're going to press each
06:47 - Rotate and I'm just going to kind of rotate it in a random way here
06:51 - So if we now hit play he's going to fall down and we can now see that he has a lot more
06:55 - Advanced physics applied than we were able to see before so I'm just going to undo that
06:59 - Rotation by pressing control bit and I'm also going to move him down here
07:03 - We can also try duplicating him, so let's press cTrl d to
07:06 - Duplicate let's move this one up and over a bit and see how they [interact] with each other awesome
07:11 - So one really important thing to understand is what is making these objects behave this way and the answer [is] of course
07:18 - Components, so if we now exit out of play mode and select the player here
07:21 - We can see that he has all of these different components the first one is something that you will see on all game objects called
07:28 - the transform component
07:29 - which just keeps track of where the game object is in space, how it's
07:32 - rotated and its size you can see we can adjust all of these and
07:36 - The game object will be adjusted accordingly and also if we go ahead and drag on the game object you will see the transform component
07:43 - Updating the rest of them though are all optional we have the mesh renderer down here
07:47 - Which is responsible for drawing the object on the screen then we go ahead and disable that it's actually going to disappear
07:53 - It's still in here
07:54 - You can see it's still in the hierarchy and it still has this green box, and we can move it around
07:59 - But until we enable the mesh renderer
08:00 - It's not going to be visible then of course we have the box collider
08:03 - Without this we wouldn't be able to collide with [all] the objects if I go ahead and disable the box collider
08:08 - And then hit play this should just fall [through] the ground
08:11 - But if we then go ahead and re-enable the box collider you can see that
08:15 - It's now able to Collide with everything so remember to get realistic physics
08:18 - We both need a collider and a rigidbody and in order to see it. We need a mesh renderer
08:23 - I of course skip the mesh filter up here. That's not because it's Super advanced
08:27 - It's just that this is only responsible for a very simple thing and that is choosing the [shape] of object right now
08:32 - You can see it has two cube selected. We can easily go in here and change it
08:35 - so we simply click on the little bowl here then we can change it to a capsule a
08:40 - Cylinder a plane a sphere and so on you will notice that it's distorted, but that's just because we messed around with the scale
08:47 - so we
08:48 - Change that to 1 and you will notice now that
08:50 - It's a sphere of course a box collider is still a box so if we want this to behave like a Few years
08:55 - We'll need to remove the box Collider
08:57 - So [right-click] [a] remove component and instead add a sphere
09:01 - Collider and notice how I'm just using search here that just makes things a lot easier
09:06 - [so] let's just [enter] that and you can see now that it has the sphere collider
09:10 - So if we go ahead, and hit play it acts like a sphere
09:12 - And this is of course more noticeable if we move it over
09:15 - So that we can see it hitting the box and it's going to go and roll off our ground plane
09:20 - Another thing is you can also adjust values while [plane] we could take our player here
09:25 - And we're still playing and move them around it might be a bit buggy sometimes when using the physics system
09:30 - But we are able to do it
09:32 - We can even go in here and say disable the ground plane [or] three different stuff like that
09:37 - But just know that any
09:38 - Adjustment that you make while in the game and running are going to go back as soon as you quit playing so make sure not
09:46 - To do any important adjustments while playing or at least remember your settings [oils]
09:50 - You're just going to have lost progress, so the final thing I wanted to do is just delete the [bowl] here
09:55 - And maybe make this a bit prettier by changing our [sky] [box] to do that
09:59 - We go and select our main camera and as the [skybox] here
10:02 - we're going to change it to
10:04 - Solid color and let's make the color here a very wide grey not the most exciting thing in the world
10:10 - But I think it looks pretty simplistic and cold by the way the way
10:13 - I just maximize the game view here is something you're going to see me do a lot of times
10:17 - That's by hitting shift space finally to save your game
10:20 - We can go ahead and hit [cTrl] s or command [s] if you're on the Mac or go to file/save
10:25 - Seems that we need to name our seen something and seems in unity are basically just
10:30 - Levels so we'll just go ahead and call this one level
10:33 - one and
10:34 - Hit save you can see now that the scene appears down here in the project panel if we had multiple scenes
10:39 - We would be able to shift between them by simply double-clicking to load that level up
10:44 - So that was pretty much all of the handy tips that I could fit into this video
10:47 - I know some things are probably really confusing but really the best way for you to learn some of this stuff is by just messing
10:52 - Around with it yourself and then of course in the next video
10:54 - We'll delve into some actual programming that was pretty much it for this video hit the subscribe button to be notified
10:59 - The new video comes out I upload Sundays and Wednesdays
11:02 - [and] of course if you're a fan of the channel you can always support me over at Patreon Patreon calm [Stash] [brackets]
11:07 - So thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video
11:09 - Thanks to all the awesome patreon supporters who donated in December and a special thanks to Sultan [Al] [sharif] [Derrick] James Kirk [Face] Tamara phi
