00:01 - asset pack available at dev assets calm
00:03 - the western props back by dark Ellen

00:10 - just right so that you guys will choose
00:12 - to support the project after all we are
00:14 - counting solely on your support
00:20 - so you can of course just go grab the
00:22 - pack from the link in the description
00:23 - and set it up yourselves but he isn't
00:25 - sure to turn how to get everything
00:26 - working in unity in case you're in doubt
00:28 - so so download the assets just go to dev
00:31 - assets comm and you can see it's pretty
00:33 - much here on the front page so let's
00:35 - just go ahead and click on that image
00:36 - you can check out some of the
00:38 - screenshots here and when you're ready
00:40 - to download simply select the price that
00:41 - you can afford and go ahead and hit the
00:43 - blue button it's going to download at
00:45 - the zip file that we can just double
00:46 - click it's going to open up and we can
00:48 - see this weapon props pack folder we can
00:50 - just drag that to any location on the
00:52 - computer and it's going to unzip it then
00:54 - we can open up the western props pack
00:56 - folder inside is a readme a models
00:58 - folder and a western props unity package
01:00 - if you're not using unity you can go
01:02 - ahead and grab all the models and
01:03 - textures inside of the models folder
01:05 - everything is neatly organized if you
01:07 - are using unity however I really
01:09 - recommend just double clicking on the
01:10 - western props unity package as you can
01:12 - see I have an empty unity project
01:14 - already open
01:15 - so when we double-click it it's just
01:16 - going to start importing so click import
01:18 - wait for unity to load everything in and
01:20 - a Western props pack should now appear
01:22 - in your project panel so let's expand
01:24 - that and double click on the example
01:25 - scene and we can see just how easy it
01:27 - was to get all these awesome looking
01:29 - models working inside of unity this is
01:31 - rendered without any effects on the
01:32 - camera just plain models so if we now
01:35 - want to bring one of these props into
01:36 - our game we can simply go to the prefabs
01:38 - folder select the one we'd like I'm just
01:40 - going to go ahead and take the wooden
01:42 - barrel here and rub it into your scene
01:44 - notice how every single model uses the
01:46 - standard shader and has both an ax B Doe
01:48 - a metallic a normal map and an occlusion
01:51 - map it's pretty much tailored to work
01:52 - with unity right at the gate and pretty
01:54 - much any other PBR workflow the amazing
01:56 - part about this is that we can easily
01:57 - change the mood of our scene and still
01:59 - have the models look awesome let's for
02:00 - example just take our directional light
02:02 - and disable it and all of a sudden we
02:04 - have a nice-looking nighttime scene and
02:06 - all of the models are rendering
02:08 - appropriately let's pretty much it for
02:09 - this video I will of course have a
02:11 - regular tutorial out on Sunday and until
02:13 - then I hope you will just enjoy going
02:15 - nuts with this pack so yeah thanks for
02:16 - watching and I will see you in the next
02:18 - video
