00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to the
00:05 - third video covering the allnew unity gy
00:08 - system introduced with unity
00:10 - 4.6 so Unity 4.6 is still in a public
00:14 - beta so to download it please just head
00:16 - over to unity3 do3d.com and you can
00:20 - download it there also if you have any
00:22 - questions throughout this video please
00:24 - just visit forum. bra.com and ask a
00:28 - question here uh I among many other
00:30 - developers are just waiting to to answer
00:33 - your
00:34 - questions cool so the topic of today's
00:37 - video is just going to expand a a bit on
00:40 - what we did last so the last video was
00:42 - pretty short and uh I hopefully this one
00:45 - is going to be to um we took a look at
00:48 - uh making our buttons actually do
00:51 - something whenever we press them and
00:52 - today we're simply going to do the same
00:54 - but with sliders so how we can set up
00:58 - sliders to interact with our gameplay
01:00 - elements so as always I've opened up
01:03 - unity and I've created a very basic
01:05 - scene here we simply have a a main
01:09 - camera with a background then we have a
01:12 - a cube just a simple standard Unity Cube
01:15 - and then we have a uh button which we
01:17 - set up in the last video and now I've
01:20 - also created a slider and I've basically
01:23 - just let the slider be as is I've just
01:25 - scaled it a bit and changed the uh the
01:28 - color of some of the elements just to
01:30 - make it fit but other than that it's
01:32 - completely um uh from fresh I mean
01:36 - nothing has changed here so what we're
01:38 - going to do is on my Cube I've created a
01:43 - script called rotate Cube and it has a
01:46 - public variable called speed which is
01:49 - currently set to 30 so when we press
01:52 - play right now you can see that this
01:54 - Cube rotates around the y
01:58 - axis and uh if we go ahead and and
02:00 - double click on the rotate Cube script
02:02 - here to inspect it I can uh show you
02:05 - just how simple this functionality
02:07 - actually is so I've created a public
02:09 - float called speed and I've just
02:12 - defaulted it to 10 I've set it to 30 in
02:14 - the inspector then inside of the update
02:17 - function I simply Ed the transform.
02:19 - rotate to rotate it around its local Y
02:23 - axis dependent on the speed and then I
02:26 - multiply with time. Delta time so that
02:29 - it's not going to be frame rate
02:31 - dependent but what we are going to do is
02:33 - we're going to make our slider control
02:36 - the speed that it uh that it um rotates
02:39 - with so in order to do this we're going
02:41 - to make a public void so a public
02:45 - function that doesn't return anything
02:47 - and let's call this adjust
02:50 - speed and this is going to take a some
02:54 - just a single argument and we just going
02:56 - to call this
02:58 - um let let's see this is already speed
03:01 - so let's just call this
03:03 - new speed and make sure to uh set this
03:08 - as a type of float so we're going to
03:10 - make a float called new
03:12 - speed and then we're simply going to
03:15 - open up the function here and inside of
03:18 - this we're simply going to set our speed
03:20 - variable to be equal to new speed and
03:24 - that's all we have to do inside of our
03:27 - script so simply save this now we can
03:30 - head into the canvas we can select our
03:34 - slider we can go down here to the on
03:37 - value changed single you can see that
03:40 - the list is currently empty so let's hit
03:43 - the plus sign let's select the object so
03:46 - I'm just going to find the cube there it
03:48 - is so once we've selected our Cube we
03:51 - can go ahead and select a function on
03:53 - that Cube and you will notice that it
03:55 - has both a game object uh category the
03:59 - trans transform component has a bunch of
04:01 - things so does the mes filter the Box
04:04 - col and the mesh renderer but it also
04:06 - has our newly created script called
04:09 - rotate Cube and once we dig under this
04:12 - you can see that it has some different
04:14 - static par parameters that we can uh
04:18 - change but it also has a dynamic float
04:22 - called adjust speed so once we select
04:25 - this it's actually going to work just
04:28 - like that now it's it's going to input
04:31 - the uh value of the slider into this new
04:33 - speed variable and then it's going to
04:35 - set the speed to that new
04:38 - float so uh if we hit play right now you
04:43 - will see that this is working but it's
04:45 - rotating extremely slowly it's simply
04:48 - going between zero and one and that's
04:51 - not really something we want so in order
04:54 - to change this let's set the max value
04:56 - to maybe 200 just for fun
05:00 - and the minimum value we're just going
05:02 - to keep that as at zero but right now
05:06 - our default value is set to one so in
05:10 - order to change this we're just going to
05:13 - use the slider to change our default
05:15 - value and I'm just going to default this
05:18 - to 30 as I did before so now when we hit
05:22 - play you can see that it rotates as
05:25 - before but we can now control the speed
05:27 - that it rotates with you using this
05:30 - slider and that's super fun so uh you
05:33 - could of course also go -200 here if you
05:36 - wanted it to rotate in the opposite
05:39 - direction uh you can see that our slider
05:42 - changes accordingly and now we can
05:44 - rotate in both directions so that's the
05:47 - basics of editing scripts uh or editing
05:50 - values based on a normal UI slider it's
05:55 - simply that easy and in here we can of
05:57 - course do all kinds of different stuff
05:59 - we can change the color of objects we
06:01 - can change the loudness of Music
06:04 - whatever you want to do simply using
06:07 - this basic formul with a public function
06:10 - a name you input a float take a float as
06:13 - an argument and then you do something
06:16 - based on that
06:17 - float so that was basically it for this
06:20 - video I actually managed to keep it
06:22 - pretty short so that's a a record almost
06:25 - so thanks for watching today's video and
06:28 - I'll see you in the next one oh
06:31 - [Music]

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to the third video covering the allnew unity gy system introduced with unity 4.6 so Unity 4.6 is still in a public beta so to download it please just head over to unity3 do3d.com and you can download it there also if you have any questions throughout this video please just visit forum. bra.com and ask a question here uh I among many other developers are just waiting to to answer your questions cool so the topic of today's video is just going to expand a a bit on what we did last so the last video was pretty short and uh I hopefully this one is going to be to um we took a look at uh making our buttons actually do something whenever we press them and today we're simply going to do the same but with sliders so how we can set up sliders to interact with our gameplay elements so as always I've opened up unity and I've created a very basic scene here we simply have a a main camera with a background then we have a a cube just a simple standard Unity Cube and then we have a uh button which we set up in the last video and now I've also created a slider and I've basically just let the slider be as is I've just scaled it a bit and changed the uh the color of some of the elements just to make it fit but other than that it's completely um uh from fresh I mean nothing has changed here so what we're going to do is on my Cube I've created a script called rotate Cube and it has a public variable called speed which is currently set to 30 so when we press play right now you can see that this Cube rotates around the y axis and uh if we go ahead and and double click on the rotate Cube script here to inspect it I can uh show you just how simple this functionality actually is so I've created a public float called speed and I've just defaulted it to 10 I've set it to 30 in the inspector then inside of the update function I simply Ed the transform. rotate to rotate it around its local Y axis dependent on the speed and then I multiply with time.
