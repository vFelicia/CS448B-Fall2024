00:00 - this video is brought to you by our own
00:01 - Metta thank you so much for donating if
00:03 - you want to support breakage yourself
00:04 - you can go to patreon.com/scishow so on
00:07 - over comes this video in game math
00:08 - theory a series that covers essential
00:10 - mathematical concepts that you will
00:12 - definitely run into during your game
00:13 - development career today we'll be
00:15 - looking at sine waves the topic of sine
00:17 - waves is one of those fundamental
00:18 - mathematical phenomenons that has
00:20 - fascinated developers for a long time
00:22 - because of their simple organic nature
00:24 - they're used in a number of ways in
00:25 - totally different aspects of development
00:27 - such as making waves in the ocean moving
00:30 - around enemies or even generating sound
00:34 - so what is a sine wave
00:36 - a sine wave is a function if we observe
00:38 - a sine wave shown on a coordinate system
00:39 - we can see that if we input any value
00:42 - which we call X into the function sine
00:44 - we will get some value that's called
00:46 - that Y if for example we insert the
00:48 - value 1 into the function we get a value
00:50 - of 0.8 as we insert values of increasing
00:53 - size we can see that the resulting Y
00:55 - value smoothly goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to
00:58 - minus 1 and then back to 0 we say that
01:01 - the function oscillates between 1 and
01:03 - minus 1 from the graph it becomes clear
01:05 - that the function repeats itself in fact
01:07 - we can keep zooming out from the graph
01:08 - and the sine wave will always repeat to
01:10 - understand why this is happening we have
01:12 - to look at how a sine wave is
01:13 - constructed we begin by drawing a circle
01:15 - in the center of our coordinate system
01:17 - and giving it a radius of exactly 1 unit
01:19 - you'll never guess what the circle is
01:21 - called that's right the unit circle I
01:23 - need to get out more if we then draw a
01:25 - line from the center of the circle to a
01:27 - point on the circle we can create a
01:28 - right angle triangle where line will act
01:30 - as the hypotenuse now what if I told you
01:32 - that the angle in the left-hand corner
01:34 - of the triangle is actually the x value
01:36 - that we input into the function and that
01:38 - the y coordinate of the upper corner of
01:40 - the triangle which we can just read off
01:42 - the y axis is in fact the resulting
01:44 - value of the function so if we begin at
01:46 - an x value of 0 meaning that the angle
01:48 - will be 0 degrees and then start to
01:50 - increase that number we see that the
01:51 - height of the triangle slowly moves
01:53 - towards 1 then back to 0 and as our
01:55 - angle goes above 180 degrees the Y value
01:58 - becomes minus 1 and then completes the
02:01 - loop by going back to 0 here's how it
02:03 - looks together with the graph because
02:05 - the total number of degrees in a circle
02:07 - is 360 our function will repeat in
02:09 - intervals of exactly 360 which we also
02:12 - see on the graph one thing
02:13 - we have to be careful with when dealing
02:15 - with the sign function is that because
02:16 - it uses an angle as input we have to
02:19 - decide what unit of measurement we want
02:20 - to use most people are familiar with
02:22 - using degrees to measure angles but it's
02:24 - just as common to use radians the only
02:26 - difference is that instead of going from
02:28 - zero degrees to 360 degrees the angle
02:31 - goes from zero radians to two pi radians
02:33 - pi of course being the number 3.14 so
02:37 - let's have a look at a practical example
02:38 - where sine waves come in handy say that
02:41 - we want to create a cool hover animation
02:43 - for a coin well whenever we want to
02:45 - animate something over time we simply
02:47 - use the amount of seconds passed since
02:48 - we started the game as input for our
02:50 - sine function so in this case we could
02:52 - set the Y position of our coin equal to
02:54 - the sine of T where T is time that means
02:57 - that the coin starts with the Y position
02:58 - of zero and then smoothly moves up and
03:01 - down as time goes by if you want to
03:03 - increase the speed of our animation we
03:04 - would multiply our time variable with
03:06 - some number multiplying by two will make
03:08 - the animation go twice as fast
03:10 - just as multiplying with 0.5 will make
03:12 - the animation go twice as slow we can
03:14 - also influence how far the coin moves up
03:16 - and down to do this we simply multiply
03:18 - the entire function sine of T by a
03:20 - number so if you want the coin to move
03:22 - two units up and two units down we would
03:24 - multiply it by two and again we can
03:26 - reduce the distance that the coin moves
03:27 - by multiplying with a small number but
03:29 - hey that's just a theory
03:31 - at game maths the bonus fact that beep
03:34 - sound is made with the sine wave
03:35 - remember the coin is just one example of
03:38 - where you can insert sine functions to
03:39 - create repeating behaviors and hopefully
03:41 - this video has given you some ideas of
03:43 - how you can play with sine waves
03:44 - yourself if you make something cool or
03:46 - have any questions make sure to share it
03:48 - on the brakus forum that's pretty much
03:49 - all I have to show for this video if
03:50 - you're interested in learning more about
03:52 - sine waves that's a link for that in the
03:53 - description I hope you enjoyed this
