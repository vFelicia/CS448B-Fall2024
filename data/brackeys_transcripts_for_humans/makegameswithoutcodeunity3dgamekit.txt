00:00 - something that can be extremely useful
00:01 - when learning how to use unity is some
00:03 - solid examples especially for artists or
00:06 - non programmers in general it can be
00:08 - really difficult to start with a
00:09 - completely empty scene I mean not that
00:11 - it ever happens to me but I'm aware of
00:14 - the issue but most of the time you want
00:19 - some basic mechanics in place like a
00:21 - character and a camera rig as well some
00:24 - visual tools to help you start crafting
00:25 - levels and this is exactly where the
00:27 - Unity game kit comes in the game kit
00:30 - comes in both a 2d and 3d version and is
00:32 - basically a collection of mechanics
00:34 - systems tools and assets to hook up
00:37 - gameplay without writing any code in
00:39 - this video we'll be focusing on the 3d
00:41 - game kid but the 2d version is also
00:43 - available and works in much the same way
00:45 - that's of course I'll link to that in
00:46 - the description also this video is
00:48 - sponsored by unity so let's get started
00:51 - so first we have to install 3d game kit
00:53 - to do this we go under window and we see
00:56 - like the asset store the shortcut for
00:58 - this is control 9 let's go to the top
01:00 - and type in game kit and we see both the
01:03 - 3d and 2d game kit appears I'm gonna
01:06 - select 3d and now using this button to
01:08 - the right we can both download and
01:10 - import it do note that the package is
01:12 - quite big it's for gigabyte in size this
01:15 - is because it's packed with a bunch of
01:16 - high quality assets so importing will it
01:18 - take some time now I'm gonna hit import
01:20 - and because we are importing a complete
01:23 - project it's going to go ahead and
01:24 - overwrite all of our current project
01:26 - settings I'm importing this into an
01:28 - empty project so that's fine by me and
01:30 - I'm just gonna hit import we then get
01:32 - this window where we can choose what
01:33 - parts of the package that we want
01:36 - I just want to include everything so I'm
01:38 - simply gonna hit import when it's done
01:41 - we should have a folder called 3d game
01:43 - kit and if we open this up we can see a
01:45 - bunch of different sub folders with the
01:47 - different resources that are in the pack
01:50 - if you go under scenes then game play we
01:53 - can see that there are two example
01:54 - levels that we can check out let's start
01:56 - by opening up level 1 here and as you
01:58 - can see level 1 is a huge outdoor scenes
02:01 - showing off a bunch of the different
02:02 - environmental assets we also have a
02:04 - player setup called Ellen
02:06 - they also some enemies in the scene as
02:08 - well as some different into activists
02:10 - and moving objects like doors and
02:12 - different puzzle elements
02:14 - so I would definitely recommend trying
02:15 - to play through this level and seeing
02:18 - how these different systems can be used
02:19 - together the game kit uses automated
02:22 - hardware detection to automatically
02:23 - adjust quality settings so the game
02:25 - should run just fine on your computer
02:27 - however I found that when running it
02:29 - inside of the editor I sometimes can get
02:31 - some framedrops so if you want you can
02:33 - always go to edit project settings then
02:35 - quality and tune down your settings here
02:37 - if you want better frame rates for now
02:39 - I'm just gonna leave it add fantastic
02:41 - and let's try playing the game so as you
02:43 - can see right away we can move around
02:45 - and control the camera the game also
02:47 - comes with a tiny example tutorial so
02:50 - here we can jump over as well as a
02:52 - weapon so I'm gonna go here and select
02:54 - this staff and we can use the staff
02:56 - throughout the game to destroy these
02:58 - crates or fight these enemies and here's
03:01 - an example of one of the puzzle pieces
03:03 - this is a trigger pad and if we step
03:05 - onto it we can see that a doorway opens
03:08 - and this cutscene is triggered I
03:10 - definitely recommend playing through the
03:12 - rest of the level and trying to tweak
03:13 - different things in here to see what
03:16 - happens there's also a second level and
03:18 - this is more of an indoors underground
03:20 - environment so again really just have
03:22 - fun with these scenes now once you're
03:24 - ready we can try creating our own level
03:26 - from scratch to do that we go under kit
03:28 - tools and we create a new scene here we
03:30 - can give the scene a name I'm just gonna
03:32 - call it example level and let's hit
03:34 - create and right away you can see that
03:36 - it creates this new scene with a bunch
03:39 - of different things in it and we also
03:40 - get this pro builder pop-up window I'm
03:43 - just gonna dock this to the side of my
03:45 - scene view and let's have a look at
03:46 - what's in here so the first thing that
03:48 - is in here is of course our example
03:50 - character Elin and she also has a camera
03:52 - rig attached to her if we go to the game
03:55 - view we can see there's also a skybox in
03:57 - here with some distant mountains of
03:59 - course our character is standing on a
04:01 - ground plane there's also some UI
04:03 - showing our current health some tools
04:05 - which we will get into later there's
04:07 - some light post-processing and another
04:09 - cool thing that's in here is pro builder
04:11 - now if you haven't used pro builder
04:13 - before we have a dedicated tutorial on
04:15 - the subject so definitely check that out
04:16 - basically what it allows us to do is
04:18 - easily create and edit meshes inside of
04:21 - unity so if we for example select our
04:23 - ground plane here we can simply go to
04:25 - the top and say choose
04:27 - the very text addiction mode and we can
04:29 - then start editing the geometry of a
04:31 - grant playing from within the editor so
04:33 - that's pretty cool for now we'll just
04:35 - use the default assets as is so I'm
04:37 - gonna go ahead and close this window and
04:39 - now let's try and throw together a quick
04:40 - environment the first thing that I'm
04:42 - gonna do is select our ground here I'm
04:44 - gonna choose R for scale and scale it up
04:46 - a bit and you'll notice that as I scale
04:48 - this up our texture simply tiles nicely
04:51 - across it we don't see any weird
04:52 - stretching I'm also just gonna flatten
04:54 - the ground a bit by scaling it down on
04:56 - the Y so now we have a fairly large
04:58 - piece of ground then we can go under the
05:01 - 3d game kit folder under prefabs and
05:03 - then here are a bunch of different ready
05:05 - to use prefabs that we can simply add to
05:07 - our game I'm gonna go under environment
05:09 - then rock and you can always click on
05:11 - assets to preview them I'm gonna take
05:14 - this cliff big here and drag it into the
05:16 - scene and you can see it already looks
05:18 - really nice in our scene we can then
05:19 - rotate move and scale it to place it
05:22 - where we want I'm just gonna drag in
05:24 - some more cliffs so I think that already
05:31 - looks a lot better we can also go under
05:33 - stonework or structures and in here are
05:36 - a bunch of really cool man-made
05:37 - monuments for example I'm really fond of
05:40 - this floor circular so I'm definitely
05:42 - gonna put that in here alright so that's
05:49 - most of the base structures of a level
05:51 - done I'm also gonna go in and add her
05:53 - dropship so under environment there's a
05:55 - folder called dropship and there's also
05:57 - a prefab with the same name I'm just
05:59 - gonna flip this to a point towards her
06:01 - just to give our level a tiny bit of
06:03 - context and at this point we can go in
06:04 - and add some vegetation some ground
06:06 - coverage and just some overall detail to
06:08 - help tie the level together and of
06:10 - course there are prefabs for this as
06:12 - well but going in and placing individual
06:14 - rocks one by one will take a huge amount
06:17 - of time for a level like this luckily
06:19 - this is where the tools come in here we
06:22 - have a vegetation painter if we open
06:24 - this up it split up into four different
06:26 - categories let's start with the ground
06:28 - cover and when we click this we can see
06:30 - there's this instance painter component
06:32 - here in choose between our different
06:33 - prefabs so there's currently some grass
06:36 - and if we just hover over our ground we
06:38 - can see that we now have this brush
06:40 - we can control all the different
06:42 - settings for our brush to the right here
06:44 - but it's pretty good to know that if we
06:45 - simply hold down alt and scroll we can
06:48 - increase or decrease the size of it so
06:50 - I'm just gonna paint in some quick grass
06:52 - around our level
06:54 - we can also add a bit of the other plant
06:57 - here which I really like
06:59 - once we've covered the ground with some
07:01 - detail we can go in and paint some of
07:03 - the larger pieces of vegetation and here
07:05 - we have a bunch of really cool-looking
07:07 - alien plans to choose from again I'm
07:09 - just gonna scatter some of these around
07:10 - the level
07:12 - and finally we can add some rocks to our
07:15 - scene of course this works in exactly
07:16 - the same way
07:18 - that's a final touch I'm gonna go in new
07:20 - structures and add in a alien statue
07:24 - this one is just circle now let's try
07:27 - playing the game to see how it feels I
07:29 - am by no means a level designers I'm
07:31 - actually quite pleased with this but of
07:33 - course we are currently just running
07:35 - around in an empty environment we need
07:37 - to add things that we can interact with
07:39 - to do this we go under prefabs and
07:41 - interactable x' and the first thing that
07:43 - we could add to our scene is a
07:44 - destructible box let's simply take this
07:47 - and drag it in and now when we run up to
07:49 - this box and hit it it's going to get
07:51 - destroyed so that's really easy of
07:53 - course there's also some more
07:55 - interesting objects in here such as a
07:57 - moving platform let's take this and
07:59 - place it over here to the side of our
08:01 - character and this moving platform uses
08:03 - a component called this simple
08:05 - translator all this component does is
08:07 - allow us to move an object from one
08:08 - point to another and you can also see
08:10 - that we have two points in here we have
08:12 - an end point and a start point so I want
08:14 - this platform to move up and down I'm
08:16 - gonna take the start point and just set
08:18 - that to zero zero zero and then I'm
08:21 - going to take the end point and set that
08:22 - to zero zero zero as well and then move
08:25 - it up a tiny bit on the Y we can also
08:27 - use these handles in the scene to
08:29 - control it if we then make sure to
08:31 - select activate our platform we'll start
08:33 - moving right away and currently the loop
08:35 - type is set to once which means that it
08:37 - will move from start to end and then
08:39 - stop let's instead set it to ping pong
08:41 - which will make it bounce between the
08:43 - two repeatedly and if we play that we
08:45 - can see that the platform is indeed
08:47 - moving between those two points and we
08:49 - can of course jump on and off it as we
08:51 - wish another interactable you can use is
08:54 - a door there are some different
08:55 - variations in here but we've actually
08:57 - already added one of these in form of
08:59 - this huge gate however the version that
09:01 - we added was only for environment set
09:04 - dressing it doesn't have any
09:05 - functionality so I'm just gonna remove
09:07 - this and instead I'm gonna drag in the
09:09 - door a huge gate wave from under the
09:10 - interactive post folder and right away
09:12 - we can see that on this is a simple
09:14 - translator as well and this is simply
09:16 - going to open up the gate for us of
09:19 - course it would be pretty boring if we
09:20 - simply open the door right when we play
09:22 - the game instead we want some way to
09:24 - trigger this functionality and this is
09:27 - where stuff like switches or pressure
09:29 - pads
09:30 - in it for example we take this pressure
09:32 - pad and add it to our scene I'm just
09:35 - going to zoom in to focus on it and find
09:37 - a good place for this we can then use
09:39 - this pressure pad to control our doorway
09:41 - and we do this using a command commands
09:44 - in the game kid are used to control
09:46 - different objects using some kind of a
09:48 - trigger so on this pressure pad that's
09:50 - already a script called send
09:51 - ontriggerenter
09:53 - and this is going to go ahead and send a
09:54 - trigger command to an object of our
09:57 - choosing in our case we want our doorway
09:58 - to open so it's simply going to take our
10:01 - huge doorway and drag it into the
10:03 - interactive object slot and you can see
10:05 - that it recognizes that there is a game
10:07 - command receiver on this object in fact
10:10 - if we select our doorway we can see that
10:12 - it's right here we also see that on the
10:15 - symbol translator script the interaction
10:16 - type is set to open this means that if
10:19 - we go to our pressure pad and set the
10:21 - interaction type here to the same thing
10:23 - the command is going to be properly
10:25 - triggered there are some different ones
10:27 - in here like activate spawn or destroy
10:30 - and that should work right away in fact
10:32 - in a scene view we can already see that
10:33 - there is a connection from our pressure
10:35 - pad to our door and if we play this and
10:38 - move on to a trigger we can see that
10:40 - indeed our door opens awesome so that's
10:43 - kind of how you can combine together
10:45 - different interactable
10:46 - to create behavior for your levels
10:48 - finally we of course also need a way to
10:50 - add enemies to our game luckily this is
10:52 - super simple if we go under the
10:54 - characters folder there is a folder here
10:56 - called enemies and in here we have three
10:58 - default enemies there's two Chomper the
11:01 - spitter and the Grenadier which is kind
11:03 - of set up like a boss I'm just gonna
11:05 - take the Chomper here and I'm gonna add
11:08 - him to the scene I'm also gonna hit F to
11:10 - focus on him right away we can see this
11:12 - huge graphic appear
11:13 - this is his field of vision and is where
11:15 - he will search for the player if the
11:17 - player enters this he will start
11:19 - attacking and we can of course go in
11:21 - here and configured if we go into the
11:22 - player scanner we can change the
11:24 - detection radius as well as the
11:26 - detection angle we know sir configure
11:28 - other settings like the amount of hit
11:29 - points this enemy has currently it's set
11:31 - to 1 and our staff deals 1 per hit
11:34 - let's try setting that to 3 to make him
11:36 - a bit tougher and right now our enemies
11:38 - should work but he won't actually be
11:40 - able to move the reason why is that all
11:43 - enemies
11:44 - in the 3d game kid use the navmesh
11:45 - system and we haven't created a navmesh
11:47 - surface for our level yet in other words
11:50 - we need to tell our enemies where
11:51 - they're able to move around our level
11:53 - doing this is actually really easy we
11:55 - just have to create a new empty game
11:57 - object I'm gonna name it navmesh surface
11:59 - I'm gonna right-click and reset the
12:01 - transform then we'll hit add component
12:03 - and search for navmesh surface as the
12:07 - agent type will select Chomper and I
12:09 - know this is called Chomper but you can
12:10 - actually use it for all the enemies then
12:12 - under include layers we need to choose
12:14 - what layers we want our enemies to avoid
12:16 - let's just set this to nothing and then
12:19 - go in and add both the environment as
12:22 - well as vegetation and now we can simply
12:24 - hit bake and we can see that it
12:26 - automatically generates this
12:27 - nice-looking blue surface of course all
12:30 - the blue parts are places that our
12:32 - enemies can move and finally if we go
12:34 - back and play our game we can see that
12:36 - if we enter into the field of view of
12:38 - our enemy he will start chasing us
12:41 - around and start trying to attack us and
12:43 - if we attack him back we can kill him
12:46 - with three strikes super cool so that's
12:49 - pretty much it for this video
12:50 - from here it's up to you to start using
12:52 - these tools to craft your own levels
12:54 - remember you can always use the example
12:55 - levels as reference to see how different
12:58 - prefabs can be used together and that
13:00 - thanks watching and I will see you in

something that can be extremely useful when learning how to use unity is some solid examples especially for artists or non programmers in general it can be really difficult to start with a completely empty scene I mean not that it ever happens to me but I'm aware of the issue but most of the time you want some basic mechanics in place like a character and a camera rig as well some visual tools to help you start crafting levels and this is exactly where the Unity game kit comes in the game kit comes in both a 2d and 3d version and is basically a collection of mechanics systems tools and assets to hook up gameplay without writing any code in this video we'll be focusing on the 3d game kid but the 2d version is also available and works in much the same way that's of course I'll link to that in the description also this video is sponsored by unity so let's get started so first we have to install 3d game kit to do this we go under window and we see like the asset store the shortcut for this is control 9 let's go to the top and type in game kit and we see both the 3d and 2d game kit appears I'm gonna select 3d and now using this button to the right we can both download and import it

run just fine on your computer however I found that when running it inside of the editor I sometimes can get some framedrops so if you want you can always go to edit project settings then quality and tune down your settings here if you want better frame rates for now I'm just gonna leave it add fantastic and let's try playing the game so as you can see right away we can move around and control the

definitely recommend playing through the rest of the level and trying to tweak different things in here to see what happens there's also a second level and this is more of an indoors underground environment so again really just have fun with these scenes now once you're ready we can try creating our own level from scratch to do that we go under kit tools and we create a new scene here we can give the scene a name I'm just gonna call it example level and let's hit create and right away you can see that it creates this new scene with a bunch of different things in it and we also get this pro builder popup window I'm just gonna dock this to the side of my scene view and let's have a look at what's in here so the first thing that is in here is of course our example character Elin and she also has a camera rig attached to her if we go to the game view we can see there's also a skybox in here with some distant mountains of course our character is standing on a ground plane there's

detail to help tie the level together and of course there are prefabs for this as well but going in and placing individual rocks one by one will take a huge amount of time for a level like this luckily this is where the tools come in here we have a vegetation painter if we open this up it split up into four different categories let's start with the ground cover and when we click this we can see there's this instance painter component here in choose between our different prefabs so there's currently some grass and if we just hover over our ground we can see that we now have this brush we can control all the different settings for our brush to the right here but it's pretty good to know that if we simply hold down alt and scroll we can increase or decrease the size of it so I'm just gonna paint in some quick grass around our level we can also add a bit of the other plant here which I really like once we've covered the ground with some detail we can go in and paint some of the larger pieces of vegetation and here we have a bunch of really coollooking alien plans to choose from again I'm just gonna scatter some of these around the level and finally we can add some rocks to our scene of course this works in exactly the same way that's a final touch I'm gonna go in new structures and add in a alien statue this one is just circle now let's try playing the game to see how it feels I am by no means a level designers I'm actually quite pleased with this but of course we are currently just running around in an empty environment we need to add things that we can interact with to do this we go under prefabs and interactable x' and the first thing that we could add to our scene is a destructible box let's simply take this and drag it in and now when we run up to this box and hit it it's going to get destroyed so that's really easy of course there's also some more interesting objects in here such as a moving platform let's take this and place it over here to the side of our character and this moving platform uses a component called this simple translator all this component does is allow us to move an object from one point to another and you can also see that we have two points in here we have an end point and a start point so I want this platform to move up and down I'm gonna take the start point and just set that to zero zero zero and then I'm going to take the end point and set that to zero zero zero as well and then move it up a tiny bit on the Y we can also use these handles in the scene to control it if we then make sure to select activate our platform we'll start moving right away and currently the loop type is set to once which means that it will move from start to end and then stop let's instead set it to ping pong which will make it bounce between the two repeatedly and if we play that we can see that the platform is indeed moving between those two points and we can of course jump on and off it as we wish another interactable you can use is a door there are some different variations in here but we've actually already added one of these in form of this huge gate however the version that we added was only for environment set dressing it doesn't have any functionality so I'm just gonna remove this and instead I'm gonna drag in the door a huge gate wave from under the interactive post folder and right away we can see that on this is a simple translator as well and this is simply going to open up the gate for us of course it would be pretty boring if we simply open the door right when we play the game instead we want some way to trigger this functionality and this is where stuff like switches or pressure pads in it for example we take this pressure pad and add it to our scene I'm just going to zoom in to focus on it and find a good place for this we can then use this pressure pad to control our doorway and we do this using a command commands in the game kid are used to control different objects using some kind of a trigger so on this pressure pad that's already a script called send ontriggerenter and this is going to go ahead and send a trigger command to an object of our choosing in our case we want our doorway to open so it's simply going to take our huge doorway and drag it into the interactive object slot and you can see that it recognizes that there is a game command receiver on this object in fact if we select our doorway we can see that it's right here we also see that on the symbol translator script the interaction type is set to open this means that if we go to our pressure pad and set the interaction type here to the same thing the command is going to be properly triggered there are some different ones in here like activate spawn or destroy and that should work right away in fact in a scene view we can already see that there is a connection from our pressure pad to our door and if we play this and move on to a trigger we can see that indeed our door opens awesome so that's kind of how you can combine together different interactable to create behavior for your levels finally we of course also need a way to add enemies to our game luckily this is super simple if we go under the characters folder there is a folder here called enemies and in here we have three default enemies there's two Chomper the spitter and the Grenadier which is kind of set up like a boss I'm just gonna take the Chomper here and I'm gonna add him to the scene I'm also gonna hit F to focus on him right away we can see this huge graphic appear this is his field of vision and is where he will search for the player if the player enters this he will start attacking and we can of course go in here and configured if we go into the player scanner we can change the detection radius as well as the detection angle we know sir configure other settings like the amount of hit points this enemy has currently it's set to 1 and our staff deals 1 per hit let's try setting that to 3 to make him a bit tougher and right now our enemies should work but he won't actually be able to move the reason why is that all enemies in the 3d game kid use the navmesh system and we haven't created a navmesh surface for our level yet in other words we need to tell our enemies where they're able to move around our level doing this is actually really easy we just have to create a new empty game object I'm gonna name it navmesh surface I'm gonna rightclick and reset the transform then we'll hit add component and search for navmesh surface as the agent type will select Chomper and I know this is called Chomper but you can actually use it for all the enemies then under include layers we need to choose what layers we want our enemies to avoid let's just set this to nothing and then go in and add both the environment as well as vegetation and now we can simply hit bake and we can see that it automatically generates this nicelooking blue surface of course all the blue parts are places that our enemies can move and finally if we go back and play our game we can see that if we enter into the field of view of our enemy he will start chasing us around and start trying to attack us and if we attack him back we can kill him with three strikes super cool so that's pretty much it for this video from here it's up to you to start using these tools to craft your own levels remember you can always use the example levels as reference to see how different prefabs can be used together and that thanks watching and I will see you in the next video yeah thanks to all the awesome patreon
