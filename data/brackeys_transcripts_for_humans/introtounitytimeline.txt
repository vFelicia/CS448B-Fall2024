00:00 - in this video we'll have a look at the
00:01 - new timeline editor in unity 2017 we'll
00:04 - have a look at how you can add and
00:05 - combine different types of tracks to
00:06 - create cutscenes and call events also
00:09 - special thanks to German and hence have
00:11 - tuned for their support on patreon let's
00:13 - get into it so we have a cymbal scene
00:15 - that consists of four vehicles a hangar
00:17 - environment and of course a camera the
00:20 - vehicles are from Devas it's and I will
00:22 - of course have a link for them in the
00:23 - description now to open up timeline we
00:25 - go window and select the timeline editor
00:27 - I'm just gonna dark this down by the
00:29 - animation panel and the first thing that
00:31 - we're going to do is create an empty
00:32 - game object where our timeline data can
00:34 - sit let's go to a hierarchy go
00:36 - right-click create empty let's reset the
00:38 - transform on this let's rename it to
00:40 - timeline and you can see now that inside
00:42 - of the timeline window it says to begin
00:44 - a new timeline create a director
00:46 - component and a timeline asset now it
00:48 - can do this for us if we simply hit
00:50 - create first we get to name our timeline
00:52 - asset this is also what we refer to as a
00:55 - playable and we can just call this our
00:57 - cutscene
00:58 - let's then hit save and you can see now
01:00 - that the cutscene appears in the project
01:02 - you will also see that it's added two
01:04 - components to our timeline the first one
01:06 - is a playable director and this
01:09 - reference is our cutscene playable
01:11 - object here we're gonna just stuff like
01:12 - whether or not we wanted to play when we
01:14 - start the game and whether or not we
01:16 - wanted to loop once it's done it also
01:18 - created an animator component and this
01:20 - is actually not something that we need
01:22 - this is just because timeline assumes
01:24 - that the object that you create the
01:26 - timeline on is going to be animated as
01:28 - well and you can see down here in our
01:30 - timeline window
01:31 - we now have a timeline that we can scrub
01:33 - through and we have a single track this
01:35 - track refers to the timeline object
01:37 - itself so we can actually just delete
01:39 - this because we don't want to be
01:40 - animating our timeline object and we can
01:42 - actually go and select that and remove
01:44 - the animator as well so now we have no
01:46 - tracks in our timeline let's go ahead
01:48 - and add a new one and here we have a
01:50 - bunch of different ones to choose from
01:51 - we're going to be creating an animation
01:53 - track this is probably the most common
01:56 - track and it's what we use whenever we
01:58 - want to play animation in our game now I
02:00 - don't have any animation done yet so I
02:02 - simply want to take the object that I
02:04 - want to animate which is the big t90 in
02:06 - the center here and drag it into this
02:08 - slot it's then gonna prompt me to create
02:10 - an animator on this t90 which I'll just
02:12 - go ahead and do
02:13 - I can simply hit the record button and I
02:15 - can then start keyframing different
02:17 - parts of my t90 I'm gonna find the
02:19 - turret pivot find a good start rotation
02:21 - go forward a bit on the timeline and
02:23 - right now this is displayed in frames we
02:26 - can change this by going to the COG and
02:27 - selecting seconds instead I think 3
02:30 - seconds sounds about right
02:31 - I can then rotate it over and it's going
02:33 - to insert a keyframe and we can now see
02:35 - that this is animating over time I also
02:37 - want to animate my gun pivot so I'm
02:39 - gonna go back a few frames set the
02:41 - starting keyframe here about there seems
02:43 - right go forward a little bit and I'm
02:45 - going to animate this up so now we can
02:47 - stop recording go back and hit play and
02:50 - we can see our animation plane if you
02:52 - then want to go back and edit your
02:53 - animation we can click the curves here
02:55 - to edit the individual curves or we can
02:57 - simply double click on the track to be
02:59 - taken to the animation window here we
03:01 - can make our adjustments and as soon as
03:03 - we go back to timeline we can see the
03:05 - changes but right now we are only
03:06 - animating one object and the strength of
03:08 - timeline is the ability to mix together
03:10 - multiple animations let's go and add
03:12 - another one this time
03:14 - that's reference our HMMWV over here
03:15 - let's drag him in and create an animator
03:17 - on him again let's hit record I'm gonna
03:20 - select the HMMWV set a start position
03:22 - move forward in time a bit and animate
03:24 - him forward so now as we scrub through
03:26 - we can see our two animations playing
03:28 - together let's stop recording and right
03:30 - now we can see and adjust all of the
03:32 - individual keyframes but if you have a
03:34 - lot of objects in here this quickly
03:35 - becomes very hard to manage and we can't
03:38 - really adjust the timing between these
03:39 - two Clips without going in and editing
03:41 - the keyframes
03:42 - let's first right click on a t90 track
03:44 - and hit convert to clip track this is
03:47 - going to take all of our keyframes and
03:48 - turn them into one single clip that we
03:50 - can easily manage we can select this
03:52 - clip and rename it to say T 90 aim and
03:56 - let's also do the same thing for a
03:57 - humvee so let's right click go convert
03:59 - to clip track and let's name this humbly
04:02 - drive and now we can mix these together
04:05 - in any way that we want we can change
04:06 - the timing or we can even adjust the
04:08 - length of these clips if we now hit play
04:10 - we can see that our T 90 starts aiming
04:12 - long before are hungry starts driving
04:14 - but after our T 90 finishes its aim it
04:17 - simply freezes if we click on the T 90
04:20 - clip we can change this by going under
04:21 - post extrapolate this means what happens
04:24 - to the animation after it's done playing
04:26 - and right now it's just set to hold so
04:28 - whatever the end frame it will just hold
04:30 - that into infinity but let's try and
04:32 - change this to something like ping pong
04:34 - this means as soon as the animation
04:36 - reaches its end it will play back in
04:38 - Reverse so if you now play our sequence
04:40 - we should see that the t90 keeps
04:42 - animating and indeed it does of course
04:45 - we want to stay organized in our
04:47 - timeline let's go add to create a track
04:49 - group here we can group together
04:51 - multiple tracks let's rename this to
04:53 - vehicles and let's drag in both our
04:56 - tracks now the next type of track that
04:57 - we want to look at is the activation
05:00 - track this allows us to simply enable or
05:02 - disable a game object it's really that
05:04 - simple and in the scene here I actually
05:06 - have two cameras I have a camera that
05:09 - focuses on the t90 and I have a camera
05:12 - that focuses on the Humvee so in our
05:14 - timeline we can use the activation track
05:16 - to switch between them we want to start
05:18 - with the camera on the t90 we can then
05:20 - add a nadi activation track and here we
05:23 - can reference the camera on a Humvee so
05:25 - in the beginning we only want the camera
05:27 - on the t90 to be active
05:29 - let's drag out the camera on a Humvee
05:31 - and then after a little while we can
05:33 - switch over to the Humvee camera so if
05:36 - we now open up our vehicles group we can
05:38 - see that we switch the camera right
05:40 - before the Humvee starts driving and
05:42 - then as it exits the frame we can go
05:44 - back to our original camera to do that
05:46 - we select the clip hit control D or
05:48 - command T if you're on the Mac to
05:49 - duplicate and simply drag it over and we
05:52 - can also extend the lifetime here to the
05:54 - end of our timeline so now if we play
05:55 - this back we should see that we have
05:57 - some nice switching between the cameras
05:59 - and it's actually starting to look like
06:01 - a cutscene let's again go ahead and add
06:03 - a track group for our new camera
06:05 - controls
06:06 - let's drag both our camera tracks in
06:08 - there you can of course also add
06:10 - pre-made animation to our timeline so if
06:13 - you want your character to play some
06:14 - animation we could simply add an
06:16 - animation track you would then link the
06:18 - character and then you can simply drag
06:20 - in animation clips to add them together
06:22 - so it basically works in the exact same
06:24 - way that it did with our vehicles and I
06:26 - think this is probably the best part
06:27 - about timeline is that you can basically
06:29 - drag in anything you'd like and it's
06:31 - just gonna play it a good example of
06:33 - this is sound so if we go under our
06:35 - sounds folder I have two sounds here I
06:37 - have some ambience
06:39 - and I have an engine start we can simply
06:42 - take our ambience and drag it into
06:44 - timeline it's gonna automatically create
06:46 - an audio track for us and we can simply
06:48 - make the clip a bit shorter a really
06:50 - cool thing is to focus on a clip you can
06:52 - simply select it and hit F just like you
06:54 - would in the scene you
06:55 - so let's now trim this to fill out the
06:56 - entire sequence and I also want to add
06:58 - the engine start now this has a bit of
07:01 - room before the engine actually starts
07:03 - if you're going here we can actually see
07:04 - that it's around 2 seconds let's take
07:07 - our engine start
07:07 - drag it into timeline let's trim it for
07:10 - about 2 seconds let's then open up our
07:12 - vehicles that we can see when our Humvee
07:14 - starts driving let's start the engine
07:15 - just a tad before that now if you hit
07:18 - play your sound won't preview
07:20 - unfortunately you still have to play the
07:22 - game in order to hear your sound working
07:24 - so let's press play to try it out
07:26 - when definitely hear the ambience and
07:28 - maybe we a bit too late on the engine
07:31 - side to fix that we'll simply drag the
07:32 - clip a tiny bit to the left let's again
07:35 - try and hit play
07:39 - and this time it works beautifully
07:41 - finally let's make sure to trim our
07:44 - engine start sound
07:45 - to the timeline length as well and just
07:47 - to clean everything up we can add a
07:49 - track group fall of our audio so that
07:53 - should be it for our preview of the
07:55 - timeline editor awesome so of course
07:58 - timeline is still very new and I'm
07:59 - definitely excited to see where they'll
08:01 - take it from here but I think the tools
08:03 - already a great starting point for
08:04 - creating cutscenes and in-game events
08:06 - and now that we have timeline I
08:08 - definitely hope to see more short films
08:09 - made with unity so if you make something
08:11 - cool using the timeline definitely make
08:13 - sure to send it to me at brackets wait
08:15 - over on Twitter
08:16 - and that thanks watching and I will see
08:17 - you in the next video thanks to all the
08:19 - awesome patreon supporters who donated
08:21 - in September and especially thanks to
08:23 - Judah Minh hence often Zig Jabalia
08:25 - Superman the great James P yes for
08:27 - magazines Thomas volley
08:28 - Sybok mummy Jason Tito Derrick Eames
08:30 - Kirk fey sommer Phi Nick Lang who some
08:33 - Gaza Aaron Robert pun and Peter Locke if
08:35 - your name's not on the list I'll make
08:36 - sure to include you later this month and
08:38 - the next month as well

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we'll have a look at the new timeline editor in unity 2017 we'll have a look at how you can add and combine different types of tracks to create cutscenes and call events also special thanks to German and hence have tuned for their support on patreon let's get into it so we have a cymbal scene that consists of four vehicles a hangar environment and of course a camera the vehicles are from Devas it's and I will of course have a link for them in the description now to open up timeline we go window and select the timeline editor I'm just gonna dark this down by the animation panel and the first thing that we're going to do is create an empty game object where our timeline data can sit let's go to a hierarchy go rightclick create empty let's reset the transform on this let's rename it to timeline and you can see now that inside of the timeline window it says to begin a new timeline create a director component and a timeline asset now it can do this for us if we simply hit create first we get to name our timeline asset this is also what we refer to as a playable and we can just call this our cutscene let's then hit save and you can see now that the cutscene appears in the project you will also see that it's added two components to our timeline the first one is a playable director and this reference is our cutscene playable object here we're gonna just stuff like whether or not we wanted to play when we start the game and whether or not we wanted to loop once it's done it also created an animator component and this is actually not something that we need this is just because timeline assumes that the object that you create the timeline on is going to be animated as well and you can see down here in our timeline window we now have a timeline that we can scrub through and we have a single track this track refers to the timeline object itself so we can actually just delete this because we don't want to be animating our timeline object and we can actually go and select that and remove the animator as well so now we have no tracks in our timeline let's go ahead and add a new one and here we have a bunch of different ones to choose from we're going to be creating an animation track this is probably the most common track and it's what we use whenever we want to play animation in our game now I don't have any animation done yet so I simply

curves here to edit the individual curves or we can simply double click on the track to be taken to the animation window here we can make our adjustments and as soon as we go back to timeline we can see the changes but right now we are only animating one object and the strength of timeline is the ability to mix together multiple animations let's go and add another one this time that's reference our HMMWV over here let's drag him in and create an animator on him again let's hit record I'm gonna select the HMMWV set a start position move forward in time a bit and animate him forward so now as we scrub through we can see our two animations playing together let's stop recording and right now we can see and adjust all of the individual keyframes but if you have a lot of objects in here this quickly becomes very hard to manage and we can't really adjust the timing between these two Clips without going in and editing the keyframes let's first right click on a t90 track and hit convert to clip track this is going to take all of our keyframes and turn them into one single clip that we can easily manage we can select this clip and rename it to say T 90 aim and let's also do the same thing for a humvee so let's right click go convert to clip track and let's name this humbly drive and now we can mix these together in any way that we want we can change the timing or we can even adjust the length of these clips if we now hit play we can see that our T 90 starts aiming long before are hungry starts driving but after our T 90 finishes its aim it simply freezes if we click on the T 90 clip we can change this by going under post extrapolate this means what happens to the animation after it's done playing and right now it's just set to hold so whatever the end frame it will just hold that into infinity but let's try and change this to something like ping pong this means as soon as the animation reaches its end it will play back in Reverse so if you now play our sequence

cameras and it's actually starting to look like a cutscene let's again go ahead and add a track group for our new camera controls let's drag both our camera tracks in there you can of course also add premade animation to our timeline so if you want your character to play some animation we could simply add an animation track you would then link the character and then you can simply drag in animation clips to add them together so it basically works in the exact same way that it did with our vehicles and I think this is probably the best part about timeline is that you can basically drag
