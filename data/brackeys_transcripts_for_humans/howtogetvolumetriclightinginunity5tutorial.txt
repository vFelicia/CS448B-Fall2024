00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to this video
00:04 - on volumetric lights in unity today
00:07 - we're going to be taking this scene and
00:09 - turning it into this and before we get
00:11 - started if you guys haven't watched my
00:13 - latest video I just launched a new
00:16 - website it's called Dev assets it's a
00:17 - place you can go to download high
00:19 - quality asset packs it's pay what you
00:21 - want and I think it's pretty awesome so
00:23 - go to Dev assets.com if you want to
00:25 - check it out and let's just jump right
00:27 - into today's video so here's the scene
00:28 - we're going to be working with today
00:29 - today some of you might recognize it
00:31 - because it's the same one I used in the
00:33 - dev assets video to Showcase some of
00:35 - these cool looking sci-fi Vehicles we of
00:37 - course going to be adding some
00:38 - volumetric lights to the scene but I
00:40 - also want to show you kind of how I put
00:42 - this whole thing together because a lot
00:44 - of you guys were curious in the comments
00:46 - and so I thought I would give you a
00:47 - quick rundown of what we have in here
00:49 - but first let's talk about what
00:51 - volumetric lights really are so here's
00:53 - an example of volumetric Lights working
00:55 - inside an engine this photo is from
00:56 - killstone which runs on the DECA engine
00:59 - and um it's a really good example
01:01 - because not only do we see the effects
01:03 - of the light on the surface and a bit of
01:06 - Bloom we also see very clearly these
01:09 - arays coming from the light and how
01:11 - these are affected by a bit of noise
01:14 - giving the impression that we have some
01:16 - dust and particles Flo floating in the
01:18 - air that the light is hitting and then
01:20 - reflecting off of and therefore we are
01:22 - able to see the light um scattering
01:25 - through the air so that's what we're
01:26 - going to be making inside of unity
01:28 - however Unity doesn't have this feature
01:30 - buil in so we have to look to third
01:33 - party Alternatives and I searched around
01:35 - a bit and I found something that I
01:37 - thought was really really cool so here's
01:39 - volumetric lights for Unity it's an open
01:41 - source project created by a guy called
01:43 - Michael and it uses the same technique
01:45 - that killone does for calculating these
01:47 - lighting effects it currently supports
01:50 - both Point lights spot lights and
01:52 - directional lights so it really has all
01:54 - the features that you're going to need
01:56 - in most pretty much all your projects
01:59 - and the cool thing about it is again
02:01 - it's open source and freely available so
02:02 - you can see here there will be a link to
02:04 - the GitHub page in the description where
02:06 - you can of course clone or download the
02:08 - project but it's set up as a Unity
02:10 - project so I thought I would go ahead
02:11 - and compile a Unity package and I've
02:15 - done this so if you just go in the
02:16 - description there will be a link for
02:18 - that as well when you open that up you
02:19 - get a folder called volumetric lights
02:22 - which inside it has a volumetric lights
02:25 - Unity package and this allows us to just
02:27 - double click this it's going to prepare
02:29 - the pack package and you can see I
02:31 - already have some of the stuff in the
02:32 - project but not the volumetric lights
02:34 - folder we can just hit import and it's
02:36 - going to set everything up for you so
02:38 - that's really easy and the warnings down
02:41 - here are not generated by the volumetric
02:43 - lights um U package they are generated
02:46 - by some other stuff I have in the
02:48 - project already because yeah it's a bit
02:50 - messy in here but just ignore those you
02:53 - should not get any uh warnings when
02:55 - doing it so now we have a volumetric
02:57 - lights folder in our project and if we
02:59 - open that up there are a bunch of
03:00 - example scenes that I definitely
03:02 - recommend you check out if you want to
03:04 - know how you can set some of this up for
03:05 - your own project more specifically you
03:07 - should check out some of the sun labeled
03:09 - ones because they show how to set up
03:11 - directional lights to work with fog and
03:14 - hazes and stuff like that all right so
03:17 - let's get started by having a look at
03:18 - what's currently in our scene of course
03:20 - we have this main light which is our sun
03:22 - a directional light with a fairly high
03:24 - intensity which has a kind of reddish
03:26 - tint and you can see just how important
03:29 - this light is if I disable it and
03:32 - reenable it we also have an accent light
03:35 - a blue light shining from the opposite
03:36 - direction you can see it hitting the car
03:39 - right here it has a much lower intensity
03:41 - and is tinted in a blue color to really
03:44 - help bring some depth into the scene you
03:46 - can see if I disable this now that
03:49 - everything looks very Bland and green so
03:52 - that's a really important thing to have
03:54 - I've also turned up the ambient uh
03:56 - intensity of our ambient light quite a
03:59 - bit so that our Skybox will illuminate
04:01 - the scene from all angles you can see
04:03 - I've turned it up to
04:05 - 1.66 the reason why is I looked at some
04:07 - reference photos from Mars and saw that
04:09 - the light was getting bounced around a
04:11 - lot we had these really bright
04:13 - illuminated scenes so I thought I would
04:15 - replicate that by just bumping up the
04:17 - ambient light awesome so other than that
04:20 - in here we of course have a Terrain
04:22 - that's just a Unity terrain which I can
04:25 - enable and disable we have a few rocks
04:27 - that I've just scattered around any Rock
04:28 - pack will do and we also have a dust
04:30 - storm and this is actually just taken
04:32 - from the standard assets I simply
04:34 - tweaked it by changing the size around a
04:36 - bit to make it look a bit better but
04:38 - that's really it and that gives this
04:41 - scene one thing that does make this
04:42 - scene look a lot better is all of the
04:44 - image effects that I have applied and if
04:47 - we go have a look at my main camera here
04:49 - you can see just what those are so first
04:51 - of all we have a global fog which just
04:54 - helps blur out the background a bit and
04:55 - adds in this bright color here I also
04:59 - have a depth of field with which is of
05:01 - course blowing the background and the
05:03 - foreground and leaving only the middle
05:05 - part here this the uh vehicle in the
05:07 - center in Focus we also have the color
05:10 - correction curves here and I do a lot of
05:13 - heavy color correction on this image you
05:14 - can see if I disable that just how much
05:17 - of a difference that makes I really
05:19 - bring out the Reds and yellows and try
05:22 - and suppress some of the greens and you
05:24 - can see I have some blue in there but
05:26 - it's not overwhelming so that's really
05:29 - helps a lot with um bringing this marsik
05:32 - feel into the scene and not just having
05:35 - it look like a desert environment or uh
05:39 - yeah you definitely don't want a lot of
05:40 - green on Mars then we also have a bloom
05:43 - which just helps blur out some of the
05:45 - highlights in the scene and we have some
05:47 - viget and chromatic operation but that's
05:50 - very very uh solid you can see if I
05:52 - disable that it's just a very very
05:54 - subtle vet we have going on here and a
05:58 - bit of chromatic operation as well just
06:00 - at 05 finally the most important part of
06:02 - the scene is of course the Sci-Fi
06:04 - Vehicles themselves you can see them
06:06 - here we have our main vehicle here in
06:08 - front and then we have two supporting
06:10 - Vehicles back here and they are part of
06:12 - the Sci-Fi Vehicles pack if you want to
06:15 - get them for yourself you can just go
06:16 - and open your browser type in Dev
06:18 - assets.com there will also be a link for
06:20 - that in the description go to sci-fi
06:22 - Vehicles choose a price that works for
06:24 - you if you are totally unable to pay we
06:26 - even have a free option because we
06:28 - understand what that's like and then you
06:31 - just hit pay what you want it's going to
06:32 - download as a zip file with a Unity
06:35 - package and everything is going to be
06:37 - set up for you so you can just drag in
06:38 - the vehicles and you're good to go so
06:41 - that's pretty much all for our scene
06:43 - let's start looking at some lights to
06:45 - get started let's go ahead and find our
06:47 - vehicle in front here or whatever you
06:49 - want to apply lights to and let's right
06:52 - click and go light and then select
06:55 - Spotlight because I want a light shining
06:57 - in a particular direction with a an
07:00 - angle and a range which really works for
07:03 - these kind of lights so let's just move
07:06 - this up a bit and position it on the top
07:09 - light here and we'll do that one first
07:11 - we'll do the two other ones as well but
07:14 - I thought we would make this one the um
07:17 - brightest one and so we'll do that one
07:19 - first let's also rotate this one on the
07:22 - xais and make sure you're in local when
07:24 - doing some rotation it just makes it
07:26 - easier and uh I'll just rotate it about
07:30 - 90° doesn't have to be totally um uh
07:34 - precise and let's go ahead and bump up
07:36 - the range here to something like 20 and
07:38 - that just means that it will shine
07:40 - further and brighter and we'll also bump
07:42 - up the spot angle I think the angle that
07:44 - Unity uses by default is very very
07:46 - narrow and you won't see this on a lot
07:49 - of lights what you see instead is a
07:51 - fairly broad spot angle where the light
07:54 - source actually hits pretty close I
07:56 - don't think this is totally unrealistic
07:58 - I want to see it hit the car and hit the
08:00 - ground a little bit as well and if we
08:02 - disable it you can see that's exactly
08:04 - what is happening so that's awesome
08:06 - let's go ahead and change the color of
08:08 - the light to a light blue just to give
08:11 - some contrast to our overall feel of the
08:13 - scene and for some reason our lighting
08:16 - just didn't uh bake correctly there but
08:18 - you can just enable and disable the
08:20 - light if that happens to you also want
08:22 - to bump up the intensity because we have
08:24 - so many intense lights in our scene we
08:25 - have to compete with this one so we'll
08:27 - just bump that up to three but that's
08:29 - going to depend totally on your scene
08:32 - I'm also going to put some heart shadows
08:34 - in here you can see what that does I
08:36 - wouldn't recommend using soft Shadows
08:38 - for a lot of Point lights that will
08:39 - quickly make your scene very very hard
08:42 - to run uh but having some hard Shadows
08:44 - on this light is not going to do
08:46 - anything at least not when we have this
08:48 - few things in our scene so now we've
08:50 - added our light and we ready to make it
08:52 - volumetric in order to do this we go hit
08:55 - add component we search for volumetric
08:58 - light and add this vol volumetric light
09:00 - script and you can see nothing is
09:02 - happening inside of our game or scene
09:04 - view that's because of two reasons
09:06 - primarily because this is not going to
09:08 - show unless we hit play and if I hit
09:12 - play it's still not going to show and
09:14 - the reason why is that we have to go and
09:16 - select our main camera hit add component
09:19 - and add the volumetric light renderer
09:22 - and this is what actually shows our
09:24 - light so now we need to go to the
09:27 - default spot cookie and we just need to
09:29 - input the spot which is part part of the
09:32 - volumetric lights pack so let's just
09:34 - double click that and now things should
09:37 - actually be working it might not be too
09:39 - clear but when we hit play we do
09:41 - actually have a bit of volumetric nness
09:44 - to this light but it's not really
09:47 - showing to make it more clear what we'll
09:49 - do is go and bump up the scattering
09:52 - coefficient and you can see once I do
09:55 - this it becomes very clear that our
09:59 - light is now shining we get these nice
10:01 - rays and this nice blooming effect it
10:04 - just looks a whole lot better but one
10:08 - thing that doesn't look too good about
10:10 - our light is how static it feels if we
10:13 - go ahead and disable our dust storm you
10:16 - can see that our light is indeed showing
10:19 - but it isn't really affected by any kind
10:22 - of dust or disturbance in the air or
10:26 - anything like that to make it feel more
10:29 - random random and lifelike we'll go and
10:31 - select the spotlight and will enable the
10:34 - noise and this is basically a way to add
10:37 - some Randomness to a light but right off
10:39 - the bat you can see just almost disables
10:41 - it that's because we have to bump up the
10:43 - noise intensity I think we can go for
10:46 - something like
10:47 - 4.5 yeah that looks a lot better but our
10:51 - noise is still not too visible and
10:53 - that's because our noise scale is too
10:55 - small if we go ahead and drag on our
10:57 - noise scale here and increase it we can
11:00 - actually see that the noise scams
11:03 - themselves become a lot smaller so you
11:06 - want definitely you definitely want a
11:08 - large noise scale but you don't want it
11:11 - too big because then it cannot be seen
11:13 - and you don't want it too small because
11:15 - then it's going to look like you've just
11:17 - overlaid a noise map and you're just
11:19 - scrolling through it and that looks
11:21 - super weird so I think something like
11:23 - .12
11:25 - SO2 looks pretty good for our case the
11:29 - fin thing that we need to edit a bit is
11:31 - the noise velocity and that is just the
11:33 - speed at which our noise will scroll
11:35 - through so if I edit this to say 20 on
11:37 - the X you can see just what that does I
11:40 - think we want the X to be around one so
11:43 - just a bit of movement there and then
11:45 - I'll y should be about -3 because our
11:48 - dust is moving towards or from the right
11:51 - side of our screen to the left side so I
11:53 - think that's going to look a lot better
11:55 - if it's in line with our dust storm so
11:58 - now make sure that you copy these
12:00 - settings on this um component so hit
12:03 - copy component and then we exit out of
12:06 - play mode make sure you do this before
12:08 - you exit play mode all your settings are
12:10 - going to be lost so now we exit play
12:13 - mode we right click and we hit paste
12:15 - component values to save all of our um
12:18 - configurations back in so now what we
12:20 - can do is maybe take this light here and
12:23 - we can rename it to our top
12:26 - light then we can duplicate it and we
12:29 - can add one to these down here as well
12:32 - so in our scene view we'll just go ahead
12:34 - and move this one down move it over a
12:37 - bit and move it forward and we'll just
12:40 - have to position it until we are happy
12:42 - with it something like that actually
12:44 - looks pretty good and we'll also
12:47 - probably want to tilt it downwards a bit
12:49 - because this lamp is pointing a bit down
12:51 - towards the ground something like that
12:53 - looks good and I definitely also want to
12:56 - edit the color so let's just go and take
12:58 - the color here and make it a bit more
13:00 - yellow orangish something like this and
13:03 - I don't want it to be too saturated so
13:05 - if we go in here and hit play now we
13:06 - should see that this is currently really
13:09 - really blown out I definitely want to
13:11 - bump the intensity down to say 1 maybe
13:13 - 1.5 at Max and I want to have the range
13:18 - decrease to something like 15 and we can
13:21 - maybe even decrease the spot angle but I
13:25 - actually think we should leave it as
13:27 - is and finally finally when we hit play
13:30 - we might also want to mess around with
13:32 - the coefficient a bit just to make it a
13:35 - tiny bit more clear to see or we could
13:38 - of course bump up the noise intensity
13:41 - but I think what we really want is maybe
13:44 - uh yeah to just bump up the scattering
13:46 - coefficient a tiny bit something like
13:49 - that just make it a bit clearer we'll
13:51 - copy the component again we'll exit out
13:53 - of play mode and we'll paste it back in
13:56 - and now we can just take this light
13:58 - rename it to something like front uh
14:01 - light and then we'll doore right
14:04 - duplicate it move it over and it should
14:08 - fit right uh away and we'll do front
14:12 - light left cool so that's pretty much
14:16 - all I wanted to show you so now when we
14:17 - hit play we should see all of the lights
14:20 - working nicely and it just adds a lot of
14:23 - depth to our scene it really makes
14:25 - everything pop it makes it feel more
14:27 - lifelike you can see what a difference
14:29 - this make if I go ahead and disable the
14:30 - lights it feels very static now and very
14:34 - 3D is and if I go in here and just move
14:38 - our camera a bit I've created this
14:39 - camera pivot where we can just rotate
14:41 - over our camera you can see how cool
14:44 - this looks when viewed from front as
14:46 - well and from the other side here so it
14:49 - just looks really really nice from all
14:52 - angles and what we can even do is maybe
14:54 - tilt our camera down so we look from
14:56 - underneath here and you can see just how
14:59 - cool of a dramatic effect this gives us
15:02 - I'm just going to show you something
15:04 - really cool about these vehicles and
15:05 - that's the fact that they are totally
15:07 - modular so if we have a look here this
15:10 - cabin here will rotate separately of the
15:12 - body we have all the wheels which will
15:15 - rotate separately as well so you can
15:17 - easily set it up with a vehicle
15:18 - controller inside of unity and we also
15:21 - have the turrets here which will also
15:23 - aim independently and uh finally some of
15:28 - these vehicles also have this top part
15:31 - here where you can put something like a
15:34 - turret or you can swap it out and simply
15:38 - use the radar that we have on the other
15:41 - vehicle here so you can really customize
15:43 - these to look the way you want them to
15:45 - and of course they are optimized for a
15:47 - PBR workflow so we have both an albo a
15:52 - specular normal map height map occlusion
15:54 - map anim Miss so all of the maps that
15:57 - you could desire are in here so again if
16:00 - you like it and you want to support it
16:02 - go to the dev asset website grab it and
16:05 - hopefully pay a bit if you able to and
16:08 - if not that's totally fine as well
16:09 - that's pretty much it for this video I
16:11 - hope you liked it remember there's a new
16:12 - video out every Sunday and wednessday
16:15 - thanks for watching this video and I
16:16 - will see you in the next one thanks to
16:18 - all the awesome Patron supporters who
16:20 - donated in November and a special thanks

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to this video on volumetric lights in unity today we're going to be taking this scene and turning it into this and before we get started if you guys haven't watched my latest video I just launched a new website it's called Dev assets it's a place you can go to download high quality asset packs it's pay what you want and I think it's pretty awesome so go to Dev assets.com if you want to check it out and let's just jump right into today's video so here's the scene we're going to be working with today today some of you might recognize it because it's the same one I used in the dev assets video to Showcase some of these cool looking scifi Vehicles we of course going to be adding some volumetric lights to the scene but I also want to show you kind of how I put this whole thing together because a lot of you guys were curious in the comments and so I thought I would give you a quick rundown of what we have in here but first let's talk about what volumetric lights really are so here's an example of volumetric Lights working inside an engine this photo is from killstone which runs on the DECA engine and um it's a really good example because not only do we see the effects of the light on the surface and a bit of Bloom we also see very clearly these arays coming from the light and how these are affected by a bit of noise giving the impression that we have some dust and particles Flo floating in the air that the light is hitting and then reflecting off of and therefore we are able to see the light um scattering through the air so that's what we're going to be making inside of unity however Unity doesn't have this feature buil in so we have to look to third party Alternatives and I searched around a bit and I found something that I thought was really really cool so here's volumetric lights for Unity it's an open source project created by a guy called Michael and it uses the same technique that killone does for calculating these lighting effects it currently supports both Point lights spot lights and directional lights so it really has all the features that you're going to need in most pretty much all your projects and the cool thing about it is again it's open source and freely available so you can see here there will be a link to the GitHub page in the description where you can of course clone or download the project but it's set up as a Unity project so I thought I would go ahead and compile a Unity package and I've done this so if you just go in the description there will be a link for that as well when you open that up you get a folder called volumetric lights which inside it has a volumetric lights Unity package and this allows us to just double click this it's going to prepare the pack package and you can see I already have some of the stuff in the project but not the volumetric lights folder we can just hit import and it's going to set everything up for you so that's really easy and the warnings down here are not generated by the volumetric lights um U package they are generated by some other stuff I have in the project already because yeah it's a bit messy in here but just ignore those you should not get any uh warnings when doing it so now we have a volumetric lights folder in our project and if we open that up there are a bunch of example scenes that I definitely recommend you check out if you want to know how you can set some of this up for your own project more specifically you should check out some of the sun labeled ones because they show how to set up directional lights to work with fog and hazes and stuff like that all right so let's get started by having a look at what's currently in our scene of course we have this main light which is our sun a directional light with a fairly high intensity which has a kind of reddish tint and you can see just how important this light is if I disable it and reenable it we also have an accent light a blue light shining from the opposite direction you can see it hitting the car right here it has a much lower intensity and is tinted in a blue color to really help bring some depth into the scene you can see if I disable this now that everything looks very Bland and green so that's a really important thing to have I've also turned up the ambient uh intensity of our ambient light quite a bit so that our Skybox will illuminate the scene from all angles you can see I've turned it up to 1.66 the reason why is I looked at some reference photos from Mars and saw that the light was getting bounced around a lot we had these really bright illuminated scenes so I thought I would replicate that by just bumping up the ambient light awesome so other than that in here we of course have a Terrain that's just a Unity terrain which I can enable and disable we have a few rocks that I've just scattered around any Rock pack will do and we also have a dust storm and this is actually just taken from the standard assets I simply tweaked it by changing the size around a bit to make it look a bit better but that's really it and that gives this scene one thing that does make this scene look a lot better is all of the image effects that I have applied and if we go have a look at my main camera here you can see just what those are so first of all we have a global fog which just helps blur out the background a bit and adds in this bright color here I also have a depth of field with which is of course blowing the background and the foreground and leaving only the middle part here this the uh vehicle in the center in Focus we also have the color correction curves here and I do a lot of heavy color correction on this image you can see if I disable that just how much of a difference that makes I really bring out the Reds and yellows and try and suppress some of the greens and you can see I have some blue in there but it's not overwhelming so that's really helps a lot with um bringing this marsik feel into the scene and not just having it look like a desert environment or uh yeah you definitely don't want a lot of green on Mars then we also have a bloom which just helps blur out some of the highlights in the scene and we have some viget and chromatic operation but that's very very uh solid you can see if I disable that it's just a very very subtle vet we have going on here and a bit of chromatic operation as well just at 05 finally the most important part of the scene is of course the SciFi Vehicles themselves you can see them here we have our main vehicle here in front and then we have two supporting Vehicles back here and they are part of the SciFi Vehicles pack if you want to get them for yourself you can just go and open your browser type in Dev assets.com there will also be a link for that in the description go to scifi Vehicles choose a price that works for you if you are totally unable to pay we even have a free option because we understand what that's like and then you just hit pay what you want it's going to download as a zip file with a Unity package and everything is going to be set up for you so you can just drag in the vehicles and you're good to go so that's pretty much all for our scene let's start looking at some lights to get started let's go ahead and find our vehicle in front here or whatever you want to apply lights to and let's right click and go light and then select Spotlight because I want a light shining in a particular direction with a an angle and a range which really works for these kind of lights so let's just move this up a bit and position it on the top light here and we'll do that one first we'll do the two other ones as well but I thought we would make this one the um brightest one and so we'll do that one first let's also rotate this one on the xais and make sure you're in local when doing some rotation it just makes it easier and uh I'll just rotate it about 90° doesn't have to be totally um uh precise and let's go ahead and bump up the range here to something like 20 and that just means that it will shine further and brighter and we'll also bump up the spot angle I think the angle that Unity uses by default is very very narrow and you won't see this on a lot of lights what you see instead is a fairly broad spot angle where the light source actually hits pretty close I don't think this is totally unrealistic I want to see it hit the car and hit the ground a little bit as well and if we disable it you can see that's exactly what is happening so that's awesome let's go ahead and change the color of the light to a light blue just to give some contrast to our overall feel of the scene and for some reason our lighting just didn't uh bake correctly there but you can just enable and disable the light if that happens to you also want to bump up the intensity because we have so many intense lights in our scene we have to compete with this one so we'll just bump that up to three but that's going to depend totally on your scene I'm also going to put some heart shadows in here you can see what that does I wouldn't recommend using soft Shadows for a lot of Point lights that will quickly make your scene very very hard to run uh but having some hard Shadows on this light is not going to do anything at least not when we have this few things in our scene so now we've added our light and we ready to make it volumetric in order to do this we go hit add component we search for volumetric light and add this vol volumetric light script and you can see nothing is happening inside of our game or scene view that's because of two reasons primarily because this is not going to show unless we hit play and if I hit play it's still not going to show and the reason why is that we have to go and select our main camera hit add component and add the volumetric light renderer and this is what actually shows our light so now we need to go to the default spot cookie and we just need to input the spot which is part part of the volumetric lights pack so let's just double click that and now things should actually be working it might not be too clear but when we hit play we do actually have a bit of volumetric nness to this light but it's not really showing to make it more clear what we'll do is go and bump up the scattering coefficient and you can see once I do this it becomes very clear that our light is now shining we get these nice rays and this nice blooming effect it just looks a whole lot better but one thing that doesn't look too good about our light is how static it feels if we go ahead and disable our dust storm you can see that our light is indeed showing but it isn't really affected by any kind of dust or disturbance in the air or anything like that to make it feel more random random and lifelike we'll go and select the spotlight and will enable the noise and this is basically a way to add some Randomness to a light but right off the bat you can see just almost disables it that's because we have to bump up the noise intensity I think we can go for something like 4.5 yeah that looks a lot better but our noise is still not too visible and that's because our noise scale is too small if we go ahead and drag on our noise scale here and increase it we can actually see that the noise scams themselves become a lot smaller so you want definitely you definitely want a large noise scale but you don't want it too big because then it cannot be seen and you don't want it too small because then it's going to look like you've just overlaid a noise map and you're just scrolling through it and that looks super weird so I think something like .12 SO2 looks pretty good for our case the fin thing that we need to edit a bit is the noise velocity and that is just the speed at which our noise will scroll through so if I edit this to say 20 on the X you can see just what that does I think we want the X to be around one so just a bit of movement there and then I'll y should be about 3 because our dust is moving towards or from the right side of our screen to the left side so I think that's going to look a lot better if it's in line with our dust storm so now make sure that you copy these settings on this um component so hit copy component and then we exit out of play mode make sure you do this before you exit play mode all your settings are going to be lost so now we exit play mode we right click and we hit paste component values to save all of our um configurations back in so now what we can do is maybe take this light here and we can rename it to our top light then we can duplicate it and we can add one to these down here as well so in our scene view we'll just go ahead and move this one down move it over a bit and move it forward and we'll just have to position it until we are happy with it something like that actually looks pretty good and we'll also probably want to tilt it downwards a bit because this lamp is pointing a bit down towards the ground something like that looks good and I definitely also want to edit the color so let's just go and take the color here and make it a bit more yellow orangish something like this and I don't want it to be too saturated so if we go in here and hit play now we should see that this is currently really really blown out I definitely want to bump the intensity down to say 1 maybe 1.5 at Max and I want to have the range decrease to something like 15 and we can maybe even decrease the spot angle but I actually think we should leave it as is and finally finally when we hit play we might also want to mess around with the coefficient a bit just to make it a tiny bit more clear to see or we could of course bump up the noise intensity but I think what we really want is maybe uh yeah to just bump up the scattering coefficient a tiny bit something like that just make it a bit clearer we'll copy the component again we'll exit out of play mode and we'll paste it back in and now we can just take this light rename it to something like front uh light and then we'll doore right duplicate it move it over and it should fit right uh away and we'll do front light left cool so that's pretty much all I wanted to show you so now when we hit play we should see all of the lights working nicely and it just adds a lot of depth to our scene it really makes everything pop it makes it feel more lifelike you can see what a difference this make if I go ahead and disable the lights it feels very static now and very 3D is and if I go in here and just move our camera a bit I've created this camera pivot where we can just rotate over our camera you can see how cool this looks when viewed from front as well and from the other side here so it just looks really really nice from all angles and what we can even do is maybe tilt our camera down so we look from underneath here and you can see just how cool of a dramatic effect this gives us I'm just going to show you something really cool about these vehicles and that's the fact that they are totally modular so if we have a look here this cabin here will rotate separately of the body we have all the wheels which will rotate separately as well so you can easily set it up with a vehicle controller inside of unity and we also have the turrets here which will also aim independently and uh finally some of these vehicles also have this top part here where you can put something like a turret or you can swap it out and simply use the radar that we have on the other vehicle here so you can really customize these to look the way you want them to and of course they are optimized for a PBR workflow so we have both an albo a specular normal map height map occlusion map anim Miss so all of the maps that you could desire are in here so again if you like it and you want to support it go to the dev asset website grab it and hopefully pay a bit if you able to and if not that's totally fine as well that's pretty much it for this video I hope you liked it remember there's a new video out every Sunday and wednessday thanks for watching this video and I will see you in the next one thanks to all the awesome Patron supporters who
