00:00 - so once again I decided to make a game
00:02 - for Ludum dari if you don't know Ludum
00:09 - dare is a huge game development
00:11 - competition where you get 48 hours to
00:13 - create a game from scratch using only
00:15 - art and code you make yourself I've
00:17 - participated more than five times now
00:19 - and it's just a blast every single time
00:22 - it's funny how with no sleep constant
00:24 - programming lots of energy drink and a
00:26 - stress factor over 9000 can make for a
00:28 - good weekend I guess that says a lot
00:30 - about us game developers anyway so
00:33 - here's how I made a game in two days but
00:36 - first this video is sponsored by core
00:38 - course the new free game creation
00:39 - platform that lets you create share and
00:41 - play games using the power of Unreal
00:43 - Engine with core no coding or art skills
00:46 - are required you can get started making
00:48 - games right away using their thousands
00:50 - of free high-quality music sound and art
00:52 - assets but if you'd like to get more
00:54 - nerdy with it corstel lets you create
00:56 - your own game logic in newer and build
00:58 - your own levels and art with the easy to
01:00 - use tools best part is you don't need to
01:02 - worry about some of the hassles that
01:03 - normally goes into making games core
01:06 - takes care of the difficult stuff such
01:07 - as multiplayer networking you can build
01:09 - games from scratch or remix and
01:11 - reimagine content shared by other
01:13 - graders and when you're ready to publish
01:15 - your game look alive instantly on the
01:16 - core platform with the click of a button
01:18 - it's completely free so I definitely
01:20 - encourage you to visit Coit Gamescom or
01:22 - click the link in the description now as
01:25 - soon as I woke up I went to the Ludum
01:27 - dare a website to check out the theme
01:29 - for this jam it was keep it alive and
01:32 - inspired by the old Tamagotchi games I
01:34 - immediately came up with the idea to
01:36 - create a card game where you play cards
01:38 - to keep your pet from dying out I was
01:41 - pretty excited about it
01:42 - but for some reason when I sat down to
01:44 - plan the actual gameplay I just couldn't
01:47 - get it to click I think my problem was
01:49 - that I was trying too hard to challenge
01:51 - myself and create something I'd never
01:52 - done before and I realized that I know
01:54 - almost nothing about card games despite
01:57 - quite a few hours in hearthstone and
01:59 - while I think it's important to
02:01 - challenge yourself sometimes if you get
02:03 - overwhelmed it's totally fine to dial
02:05 - down the expectations and change the
02:06 - game to play more towards your strengths
02:08 - so after hours of brainstorming I
02:11 - decided to do something much less comic
02:13 - but my Vishal and fun I came up with the
02:16 - idea of a DJ who is hosting the party of
02:19 - the lifetime but a cup shows up and
02:21 - tries to shut it down in other words the
02:24 - DJ is trying to keep the party alive I
02:26 - really wanted to do something with
02:28 - multiplayer and also I've done a lot of
02:30 - pixel art lately so I was really hoping
02:32 - to get into some 3d modeling instead and
02:35 - that's how party killer was born a
02:37 - top-down one we one shooter with lots of
02:39 - music and neon lights and with that it
02:42 - was time to jump into unity I started by
02:45 - setting up a quick test level threw in
02:47 - some quick lighting to set the mood and
02:48 - created two cymbal player characters one
02:50 - for the DJ and one for the police just
02:53 - pretend that that looks like a police
02:55 - hat and then spend a lot of time trying
02:57 - to get unities new input system to work
02:59 - with multiple controllers I decided to
03:01 - go with gamepad controls since I wanted
03:03 - to give the game a fun casual feel and
03:06 - after lots of time looking at
03:07 - documentation it worked the players were
03:10 - moving around the level and then added
03:12 - shooting with lots of particles and glow
03:14 - and normally I would spend most of the
03:16 - time at this early stage working on the
03:18 - base mechanics but I just felt really
03:21 - inspired to play around with some of the
03:23 - visuals so I started making triggers to
03:25 - spice up the level I created a disco
03:27 - shader that imitated light from a disco
03:29 - ball and a sea of cubes that would rise
03:32 - up and down I would have loved to have
03:34 - these actually react to the music and
03:36 - sound effects but I simply didn't have
03:38 - the time instead I scaled them up and
03:40 - down based on a simple Perlin noise and
03:42 - honestly I think the result turned out
03:44 - pretty great it's definitely not
03:46 - performant the level had over 500 cubed
03:49 - game objects each with their own script
03:51 - but hey it's a game jam it's not meant
03:53 - to be perfect and then made the game
03:55 - restart when a player got hit and at
03:58 - this point the game was fun but it
04:00 - definitely lacked some depth
04:01 - there wasn't much strategy to it it was
04:04 - hard to get better at the game other
04:05 - than by improving your aim so I decided
04:08 - to take a quick nap and come back to it
04:10 - and after lying awake for half an hour
04:12 - thinking about the game I realized that
04:14 - it needed two important things first the
04:17 - bullets should be able to bounce off of
04:19 - walls this would give the game a whole
04:21 - new dimension because you need to really
04:22 - think about how you can use the level
04:24 - to your advantage second the player
04:27 - should be able to hold up to three
04:28 - bullets after shooting your bullets they
04:30 - will slowly recharge one by one
04:32 - this forces the players to be economical
04:34 - with their bullets and to think about
04:36 - whether or not it's best to spend them
04:38 - all at once or save some for later I
04:40 - also added some quick UI to display how
04:42 - many bullets each player has and a joint
04:45 - screen for connecting controllers and
04:47 - right away we were having much more fun
04:49 - playing the game now normally during
04:52 - loading diary we get together a bunch of
04:54 - friends and set up shop in the office
04:56 - over the weekend but this time since
04:58 - everyone was still working from home we
05:00 - hung out in discord instead and man was
05:03 - that fun
05:03 - we constantly shared our screen so we
05:05 - could see what each other were working
05:07 - on and how about if anyone had issues
05:09 - it's always really great to follow each
05:11 - other's progress as you get further into
05:13 - the jam and at this point my game was
05:15 - starting to come together but playing
05:17 - over and over on the same level was
05:20 - getting kind of boring so inspired by
05:22 - multi games in csgo I decided to have
05:25 - the level change every time a player
05:27 - dies for this I chose to go with the
05:29 - same type of level loading that I did in
05:31 - date night where we'd load a level scene
05:33 - with the level layout and obstacles on
05:35 - top of a base scene that had the players
05:37 - camera and game manager and that was
05:41 - pretty much it for day one I went to bed
05:43 - feeling pretty good about what I had so
05:45 - far but there was still a long way to go
05:47 - the next day I jumped right into busca
05:49 - SOI and started working on the music
05:51 - because you can't have a party game
05:53 - without some party music I knew that I
05:56 - wanted to go for something electronic
05:58 - and intense but I wasn't sure exactly
06:00 - what genre I tried my luck with trance
06:04 - then dubstep which I found out was
06:06 - pretty hard to do only using chip tunes
06:08 - and then finally landed on well whatever
06:11 - this is
06:16 - as crazy as it is when I put it into the
06:18 - game it fit perfectly and then it was
06:21 - graphics time of course the game still
06:24 - had only one level but it was graphics
06:26 - time I used a vertex displacement shader
06:29 - to turn the player from a boring sphere
06:31 - into a living incarnation of music or
06:34 - just a weird blob I guess that's a
06:37 - matter of perspective oh and by the way
06:39 - the shader looked super cool if you
06:40 - dialed it up a bunch I would have loved
06:42 - to use that in the game if I'd had more
06:44 - time in fact I just liked the effect so
06:47 - much that I decided to add it to the
06:48 - bullets as well and then jumped into
06:51 - blender and started modeling some
06:52 - obstacles to place around the level I
06:54 - created a long wall a short wall and a
06:57 - square thingy I'm by no means a 3d
07:00 - artist but after adding some glow in
07:02 - unity I think it actually managed to
07:03 - come together pretty well and having run
07:06 - out of excuses of other stuff to do it
07:08 - was time to create some levels and it
07:10 - was actually really fun because with the
07:12 - way the levels were set up with these
07:14 - two rising cubes I could vary the level
07:16 - size and shape on top of just placing
07:19 - around obstacles this gave way for some
07:21 - interesting levels that felt really
07:23 - different when playing I then added a
07:25 - score counter UI that would pop up
07:27 - between levels and got to work on some
07:29 - sound effects for this I used a tool I
07:31 - hadn't tried before called leshy sound
07:33 - effects maker
07:34 - it's a browser-based sound generator
07:36 - that can be used to quickly generate and
07:37 - manipulate electronic sound effects I
07:40 - was really impressed with this tool and
07:42 - after playing around with it for less
07:43 - than an hour I managed to get a good
07:45 - list of sounds that fit the rest of the
07:47 - game finally I added trails to the
07:54 - bullets to make it clear what direction
07:55 - they are traveling and spent the final
07:57 - half-hour creating some more levels in
08:00 - total I ended up with 10 different
08:02 - levels which I was pretty happy with and
08:04 - then after a bunch of play testing I
08:07 - exported the game and submitted it to
08:09 - the event this is me at 5 in the morning
08:12 - tired and happy and that's pretty much
08:15 - it for this video if you enjoyed it make
08:17 - sure to subscribe and bring that
08:19 - notification buzz so don't miss the next
08:21 - one if you want to play and rate the
08:23 - game there's of course a link in the
08:24 - description and I'll make sure to

so once again I decided to make a game for Ludum dari if you don't know Ludum dare is a huge game development competition where you get 48 hours to create a game from scratch using only art and code
