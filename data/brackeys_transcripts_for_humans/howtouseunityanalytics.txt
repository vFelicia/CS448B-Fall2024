00:00 - analytics can play a huge part of making
00:02 - a game successful because it's just so
00:04 - hard to know from the beginning how
00:06 - people are going to experience different
00:07 - parts of your game so in this video
00:09 - we'll have a look at enabling Unity
00:10 - analytics and how you can use stuff like
00:12 - custom events funnels and remote
00:14 - settings to probably monitor your game
00:16 - and make changes after it goes live on
00:18 - the screen now you should see all the
00:19 - things that we're going to cover in this
00:20 - video feel free to skip to any one of
00:22 - them also there's a lot of terminology
00:23 - when it comes to analytics I'll have a
00:25 - link to a glossary in the description
00:27 - alright let's get started let's begin by
00:29 - enabling Unity analytics this will open
00:31 - up the services window here we can go
00:33 - under analytics and let's press the
00:35 - toggle here to enable it we then click
00:37 - continue and here we need to press play
00:39 - in the editor to validate the connection
00:41 - with analytics servers after it says
00:43 - analytics enabled we can then stop
00:45 - playing and Congrats we've actually now
00:47 - just set up Unity analytics now it says
00:50 - here it might take unity some hours to
00:51 - publish the data but we can go to the
00:53 - dashboard right away and here is the
00:55 - analytics dashboard as you can see it
00:57 - currently says pending data processing
00:59 - and of course we don't want to wait for
01:01 - this so inspired by all the great TV
01:03 - cooks I've gone it and cheated a little
01:04 - bit if you go to the top and click
01:06 - operate you can see all of your cloud
01:08 - service enabled projects here you will
01:10 - also see a demo project if we click this
01:13 - we can essentially see what our project
01:15 - is going to look like under the overview
01:16 - tab we can see stuff like our active
01:18 - players the amount of sessions this week
01:20 - use the retention as well as generated
01:23 - revenue and we can also split this up
01:24 - into nice graphs so we can see a
01:26 - development over time if you want to
01:28 - explore even more data we can go into
01:30 - the data Explorer and here we can see a
01:31 - breakdown of a whole bunch of events we
01:34 - know so split our data into multiple
01:36 - segments as you can see here there are a
01:38 - bunch of pre generated segments some of
01:40 - these are location-based some of them
01:42 - are based on demographics or target
01:44 - platforms and we can actually add
01:45 - segments ourselves we'll have a look at
01:47 - that later if we go into live stream we
01:49 - can see how our game is doing in real
01:51 - time and we can actually see our active
01:53 - users plotted on a map so this is really
01:56 - cool now if we go back to our game
01:57 - that's of course no data available yet
02:00 - but as soon as it finished processing it
02:02 - should actually already track active
02:04 - players sessions retention and all that
02:06 - however this of course a bunch of things
02:07 - that you might want to track which is
02:09 - specific to your game now inside of
02:11 - unity I've created this test scene
02:13 - called
02:13 - button in here I have a canvas with a UI
02:16 - button and the button says press me now
02:18 - let's imagine that I wanted to track
02:20 - people pressing on this button to do
02:22 - that I would go to the button and add a
02:23 - new component I would search for
02:25 - analytics and select the analytics
02:27 - tracker now here I could create a new
02:29 - event name in my case that would be
02:31 - button press and we've now just defined
02:34 - a custom event we then choose how to
02:36 - trigger this event you can trigger it
02:38 - when starting a level when enabling or
02:40 - disabling an object or we could choose
02:42 - external this means that you can trigger
02:44 - the event from other scripts in our case
02:46 - we want to trigger it whenever you press
02:48 - the button so I'm going to add an on
02:50 - click event on our button I'm gonna drag
02:51 - in our analytics tracker script I'm then
02:54 - gonna go under function go into the
02:56 - analytics tracker and click on trigger
02:58 - event now every time we click this
02:59 - button it will notify our analytics
03:01 - tracker which will trigger a button
03:03 - press event and we can actually see this
03:05 - happening in real time if we open up our
03:08 - dashboard and go under a live stream
03:10 - we'd already see that we have one user
03:11 - locking and one new user if we scroll
03:14 - down to the bottom here we can see our
03:16 - top custom events if we then go into
03:18 - unity and hit play we can try clicking
03:20 - on the button a few times I'm just gonna
03:22 - click it three times and if we now go
03:24 - back to our dashboard and we might need
03:26 - to wait a bit for it to update we can
03:27 - hopefully see that we have a button
03:29 - press event and that it has occurred
03:31 - three times now if for some reason unity
03:33 - is still setting up your analytics and
03:35 - this isn't triggering we can always see
03:37 - it working if we go under our services
03:39 - and here on the D validator we can see
03:41 - our three button presses as well as an
03:44 - exact time for triggering the event now
03:46 - that's pretty cool
03:47 - but that's actually much more we can do
03:48 - with custom events if I open up my next
03:50 - test scene here you can see that I have
03:52 - two buttons a red one and a green one
03:54 - let's say we wanted to make a game where
03:56 - we keep track of how many people have
03:58 - pressed the red button versus the green
04:01 - one in this case we could of course go
04:03 - ahead and create two separate events but
04:05 - both events would be a button press so a
04:08 - better way to do this would be using
04:10 - parameters if we go onto our canvas here
04:12 - and select our red button I'm going to
04:14 - switch to the inspector here we can see
04:16 - that I have an analytics tracker here
04:18 - with the button press and the triggers
04:20 - set to external but we can also add a
04:22 - parameter you can have parameters
04:24 - specific to different game objects
04:26 - or could have static parameters which
04:28 - are simply a single value in our case
04:30 - the name of our parameter should be
04:32 - color and the value of a parameter
04:34 - should be red now we can do the same
04:37 - thing for a green button here we add a
04:39 - parameter we change the parameter to
04:41 - static set the name to color and the
04:44 - value to green now we can switch into
04:46 - our services and hit clear on our
04:48 - validator when then hit play and we try
04:51 - pressing the red button say twice and
04:53 - the green button once and we should see
04:55 - our custom events here update to 6:00
04:58 - but we can't see parameters in live view
05:01 - instead we'll have to go into the data
05:02 - Explorer here we could add a custom
05:04 - event and here we would input the custom
05:06 - event of button press for the segment we
05:10 - could use all current users and as the
05:12 - parameter we could then input color but
05:14 - as you can see we'll have to wait for
05:16 - this to update so for now we can just
05:18 - check that everything is working in our
05:19 - validator here we can see that indeed we
05:21 - have three button presses two of them
05:23 - with a color red and one of them with
05:26 - the color green awesome and talk about
05:28 - analytics and games one of the most
05:30 - important things is trying to figure out
05:31 - where and why your player is having a
05:33 - tough time and a good way to measure
05:35 - this is using funnels funnels allow us
05:37 - to take custom events and use them to
05:39 - track how a player is progressing
05:41 - through the game serve a simple scene
05:43 - with a button for loading the next level
05:45 - and as you can see I have three
05:46 - different levels each with a button and
05:48 - then the last one is just a blank
05:50 - finished screen when pressing the button
05:52 - I'm calling two different things on a
05:54 - level loader object first of all I'm
05:56 - triggering an event on analytics tracker
05:59 - and the event name of course corresponds
06:01 - to our given level so this is level one
06:03 - for level two this says level two and of
06:05 - course for level three it says level
06:07 - three then I call a very simple method
06:09 - on the level loader all this is doing is
06:12 - just loading the next scene so if we
06:14 - were to try and hit play now and click
06:16 - on load next level a few times until we
06:19 - get to the finished level we can see
06:21 - that it calls our different events so
06:22 - first off we finished level one we then
06:24 - finished level two and finally we finish
06:27 - level three and we can see this under
06:28 - our custom events as well don't worry
06:30 - about the numbers here I've been trying
06:32 - this out a few times so now what this
06:34 - allows us to do is go up to our funnel
06:36 - analyser and add a new funnel using
06:39 - these events
06:40 - we could name this final level
06:42 - progression as the description we could
06:44 - say how many levels does the player
06:48 - complete and then we can add different
06:50 - steps so the first step here would be
06:52 - level 1 and second step would be level 2
06:55 - and the final final step would be level
06:57 - 3 we will then save this hit ok and now
07:00 - we've created our first funnel as always
07:02 - with analytics we have to wait a bit
07:04 - until this works but if we look under
07:06 - the demo app and go to the funnel
07:08 - analyser
07:09 - we can see that it's set up one for us
07:10 - this works in the exact same way it has
07:12 - three levels and it shows the number of
07:14 - people who have completed each stage so
07:16 - you can see for this game there's a
07:18 - pretty big fall up from level 2 to level
07:20 - 3 so it would probably be a good idea to
07:22 - know if the difficulty here bit now
07:24 - previously we talked about how you can
07:25 - filter by different segments we do the
07:28 - same thing here let's try and filter by
07:29 - say platform and here we can see there's
07:31 - a total drop-off from level 2 to level 3
07:34 - or for iOS users so maybe there's
07:36 - something going on there that should be
07:38 - fixed we can also add custom segments if
07:40 - you go to our own analytics going to the
07:42 - segment builder
07:43 - we can see a list of all the different
07:44 - segments added by default you can always
07:46 - hit edit if you want to change something
07:48 - about them or you can add a new segment
07:50 - say we wanted to focus on users who are
07:52 - playing a lot we could create a segment
07:54 - called hardcore fans and the description
07:57 - would be users playing a lot then that's
07:59 - the event we could say that the number
08:01 - of sessions a user had in the last week
08:03 - is and then we would say at least 10
08:06 - it's only the really hardcore users to
08:09 - create this segment we simply hit create
08:10 - and as always we'll have to wait a bit
08:12 - for the data to update now the final
08:15 - thing that I want to show you is not so
08:16 - much an analytics tool as it's a really
08:19 - great patch tool I'm of course talking
08:21 - about remote settings now remote
08:23 - settings allow you to change values in
08:25 - your game after deploying this is really
08:27 - great to build into your game because
08:29 - after deploying your analytics might
08:31 - show that your game is too hard well if
08:33 - you created a remote setting for
08:35 - difficulty you could simply go in here
08:37 - and change it right away to start using
08:39 - remote settings we first have to change
08:41 - our configuration to development this
08:43 - will allow us to use remote settings in
08:45 - the editor and all bills set as
08:47 - development builds we then go into unity
08:50 - and is of course a simple test scene for
08:52 - remote settings all we have is
08:54 - text element on an empty canvas and it
08:56 - currently just says remote setting now
08:58 - we need to download a very small package
09:00 - from the unity asset store let's go to
09:02 - the asset store and search for remote
09:05 - settings let's navigate to unity
09:07 - analytics remote settings and hit
09:09 - download and import of course have a
09:11 - link in the description that's it import
09:13 - once again let's now try and change the
09:15 - value of our text using a remote setting
09:17 - so that's it add component and let's
09:19 - search for remote settings here we can
09:21 - add a new parameter we want to change
09:23 - our textile reference our text object
09:25 - under the field here I'm gonna go into
09:27 - our text component and I'm gonna change
09:29 - the text variable and now we need to
09:31 - specify a remote setting key now we
09:34 - haven't created this yet so let's go
09:35 - into a browser let's create a new key
09:37 - let's call this key game quality we can
09:41 - change the type here to say a string and
09:43 - the default value when we release the
09:45 - game is going to be bad we then add this
09:47 - you can see now it says edited here we
09:50 - change that by hitting sync let's say it
09:52 - sync once more and unity has now pushed
09:54 - this new value to the server now we can
09:56 - go into unity and most people go right
09:58 - to the setting key here and see there
10:00 - are currently no options that's because
10:01 - we actually have to go window unity
10:03 - analytics remote settings and here we
10:05 - have to insert our secret project key to
10:09 - get this key hit the lookup the key
10:10 - button and I'm gonna play this page but
10:12 - if I scroll down here you should see a
10:14 - field called project secret key simply
10:17 - copy this paste it into the field in the
10:19 - editor and hit next and you should now
10:22 - see all of the remote settings that you
10:23 - have configured on your dashboard we can
10:25 - see the key game quality of type string
10:27 - and that it currently has a value of pad
10:29 - let's now close this window and if we
10:31 - then go to our remote settings we can
10:33 - now select the game for the key if we
10:35 - hit play our text will automatically
10:37 - update to say bad we can then deploy our
10:40 - game to all kinds of systems and cross
10:42 - our fingers that our reviews are alright
10:44 - and when we then have a look at our
10:46 - analytics and find out that something is
10:49 - wrong here all we need to do is go to
10:51 - our dashboard edit our game quality and
10:53 - change it to good if we save that sync
10:56 - it and hit sync again we should see that
10:59 - the next time we play our game the
11:01 - result is good
11:02 - let's pretty much it for this video if
11:04 - you enjoyed it make sure it subscribes
11:05 - our dome it's a future one also unity
11:07 - pro
11:07 - allows you to do a lot more stuff with
11:09 - services so if you find yourself often
11:11 - using these I definitely recommend you
11:13 - check it out I'll ever link to it down
11:14 - in the description also let me know if
11:16 - there are any other services you want me
11:17 - to take a look at such as collaboration
11:19 - or ads on that thanks watching and I
11:21 - will see you in the next video thanks to
11:24 - all the awesome patreon supporters who
11:25 - donated in August and a special thanks

Cleaned transcript:

analytics can play a huge part of making a game successful because it's just so hard to know from the beginning how people are going to experience different parts of your game so in this video we'll have a look at enabling Unity analytics and how you can use stuff like custom events funnels and remote settings to probably monitor your game and make changes after it goes live on the screen now you should see all the things that we're going to cover in this video feel free to skip to any one of them also there's a lot of terminology when it comes to analytics I'll have a link to a glossary in the description alright let's get started let's begin by enabling Unity analytics this will open up the services window here we can go under analytics and let's press the toggle here to enable it we then click continue and here we need to press play in the editor to validate the connection with analytics servers after it says analytics enabled we can then stop playing and Congrats we've actually now just set up Unity analytics now it says here it might take unity some hours to publish the data but we can go to the dashboard right away and here is the analytics dashboard as you can see it currently says pending data processing and of course we don't want to wait for this so inspired by all the great TV cooks I've gone it and cheated a little bit if you go to the top and click operate you can see all of your cloud service enabled projects here you will also see a demo project if we click this we can essentially see what our project is going to look like under the overview tab we can see stuff like our active players the amount of sessions this week use the retention as well as generated revenue and we can also split this up into nice graphs so we can see a development over time if you want to explore even more data we can go into the data Explorer and here we can see a breakdown of a whole bunch of events we know so split our data into multiple segments as you can see here there are a bunch of pre generated segments some of these are locationbased some of them are based on demographics or target platforms and we can actually add segments ourselves we'll have a look at that later if we go into live stream we can see how our game is doing in real time and we can actually see our active users plotted on a map so this is really cool now if we go back to our game that's of course no data available yet but as soon as it finished processing it should actually already track active players sessions retention and all that however this of course a bunch of things that you might want to track which is specific to your game now inside of unity I've created this test scene called button in here I have a canvas with a UI button and the button says press me now let's imagine that I wanted to track people pressing on this button to do that I would go to the button and add a new component I would search for analytics and select the analytics tracker now here I could create a new event name in my case that would be button press and we've now just defined a custom event we then choose how to trigger this event you can trigger it when starting a level when enabling or disabling an object or we could choose external this means that you can trigger the event from other scripts in our case we want to trigger it whenever you press the button so I'm going to add an on click event on our button I'm gonna drag in our analytics tracker script I'm then gonna go under function go into the analytics tracker and click on trigger event now every time we click this button it will notify our analytics tracker which will trigger a button press event and we can actually see this happening in real time if we open up our dashboard and go under a live stream we'd already see that we have one user locking and one new user if we scroll down to the bottom here we can see our top custom events if we then go into unity and hit play we can try clicking on the button a few times I'm just gonna click it three times and if we now go back to our dashboard and we might need to wait a bit for it to update we can hopefully see that we have a button press event and that it has occurred three times now if for some reason unity is still setting up your analytics and this isn't triggering we can always see it working if we go under our services and here on the D validator we can see our three button presses as well as an exact time for triggering the event now that's pretty cool but that's actually much more we can do with custom events if I open up my next test scene here you can see that I have two buttons a red one and a green one let's say we wanted to make a game where we keep track of how many people have pressed the red button versus the green one in this case we could of course go ahead and create two separate events but both events would be a button press so a better way to do this would be using parameters if we go onto our canvas here and select our red button I'm going to switch to the inspector here we can see that I have an analytics tracker here with the button press and the triggers set to external but we can also add a parameter you can have parameters specific to different game objects or could have static parameters which are simply a single value in our case the name of our parameter should be color and the value of a parameter should be red now we can do the same thing for a green button here we add a parameter we change the parameter to static set the name to color and the value to green now we can switch into our services and hit clear on our validator when then hit play and we try pressing the red button say twice and the green button once and we should see our custom events here update to 600 but we can't see parameters in live view instead we'll have to go into the data Explorer here we could add a custom event and here we would input the custom event of button press for the segment we could use all current users and as the parameter we could then input color but as you can see we'll have to wait for this to update so for now we can just check that everything is working in our validator here we can see that indeed we have three button presses two of them with a color red and one of them with the color green awesome and talk about analytics and games one of the most important things is trying to figure out where and why your player is having a tough time and a good way to measure this is using funnels funnels allow us to take custom events and use them to track how a player is progressing through the game serve a simple scene with a button for loading the next level and as you can see I have three different levels each with a button and then the last one is just a blank

settings let's navigate to unity analytics remote settings and hit download and import of course have a link in the description that's it import once again let's now try and change the value of our text using a remote setting so that's it add component and let's search for remote settings here we can add a new parameter we want to change our textile reference our text object under the field here I'm gonna go into our text component and I'm gonna change the text variable and now we need to specify a remote setting key now we haven't created this yet so let's go into a browser let's create a new key let's call this key game quality we can change the type here to say a string and the default value when we release the game is going to be bad we then add this you can see now it says edited here we change that by hitting sync let's say it sync once more and unity has now pushed this new value to the server now we can go into unity and most people go right to the setting key here and see there are currently no options that's because we actually have to go window unity analytics remote settings and here we have to insert our secret project key to get this key hit the lookup the key button and I'm gonna play this page but if I scroll down here you should see a field called project secret key simply copy this paste it into the field in the editor and hit next and you should now see all of the remote settings that you have configured on your dashboard we can see the key game quality of type string and that it currently has a value of pad let's now close this window and if we then go to our remote settings we can now select the game for the key if we hit play our text will automatically update to say bad we can then deploy our game to all kinds of systems and cross our fingers that our reviews are alright and when we then have a look at our analytics and find out that something is wrong here all we need to do is go to our dashboard edit our game quality and change it to good if we save that sync it and hit sync again we should see that the next time we play our game the result is good let's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure it subscribes our dome it's a future one also unity pro allows you to do a lot more stuff with services so if you find yourself often using these I definitely recommend you check it out I'll ever link to it down in
