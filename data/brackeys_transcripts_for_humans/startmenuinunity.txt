00:00 - in this video we're going to have a look
00:01 - at how to create a cool main menu inside
00:03 - of unity at the end it should look
00:04 - something like this
00:06 - special thanks to hansoftoon duderman
00:08 - and armando rusi for their support on
00:10 - patreon and now
00:11 - let's make a menu so i currently have
00:12 - two scenes a menu one which is
00:14 - completely empty and a game one
00:16 - just pretend that you're seeing a game
00:18 - here
00:20 - now inside of our menu scene let's begin
00:22 - by creating the ui
00:23 - let's right click in our hierarchy go ui
00:26 - and select
00:27 - panel this will create a canvas and
00:29 - inside of this canvas it will create a
00:31 - panel now i want to go under image
00:33 - and replace the source image i've
00:35 - imported my own background image here
00:37 - that we can drag in
00:38 - you can choose to use any sprite here
00:40 - just make sure that when you select it
00:42 - under texture type it's set to sprite 2d
00:44 - and ui then under our panel let's go to
00:47 - color and let's amp up the alpha channel
00:49 - so now we have a nice backdrop for our
00:51 - menu
00:52 - let's rename it to background and at
00:54 - this point we're ready to add some text
00:56 - let's right click on our canvas go ui
00:59 - select text
01:00 - and of course we could just use unity's
01:02 - default text here we could scale it up
01:04 - center it change the font size change
01:07 - the color
01:08 - but that's about the control that we
01:10 - have if you want to change the font we
01:11 - need to import some custom fonts
01:13 - we can't add nice looking shadows or
01:15 - gradients and for most menus that i've
01:17 - created i definitely want to have these
01:19 - options so instead let's delete this
01:21 - text object and let's import a free
01:23 - package called
01:24 - text mesh pro so let's go to the asset
01:26 - store search for
01:27 - text mesh pro i'll of course have a link
01:29 - for this in the description let's select
01:31 - the pack here
01:32 - this pack was recently acquired by unity
01:34 - and i've created a separate video on how
01:36 - to use it
01:37 - so if you find something confusing along
01:38 - the way definitely check that out for
01:40 - now we can just hit download or
01:42 - import and we'll hit import again and
01:44 - after it's done you should see a folder
01:46 - in your project panel called text mesh
01:48 - pro now we can go back to our scene view
01:49 - we can right click on our canvas go ui
01:52 - and you should now see
01:53 - an option here called text mesh pro text
01:55 - and right off the bat we can see that
01:57 - the text renders
01:58 - a lot more clearly let's go into the
02:01 - font size here
02:02 - and let's change it to something like
02:04 - 84. let's also give our text some room
02:06 - i'll hold down alt to scale from the
02:08 - center let's make sure to align our text
02:10 - to the center both horizontally
02:12 - and vertically now instead of new text
02:14 - we'll write play with capital letters
02:16 - and i'm also going to change the font
02:17 - asset to roboto bold
02:19 - and i think we can make this even more
02:21 - bold so that's also on the font style
02:23 - check off the b here that looks pretty
02:25 - good but currently it's just
02:27 - a plain white to change this let's
02:29 - scroll down onto the material settings
02:31 - let's first add an
02:32 - underlay in order to create a shadow
02:34 - let's enable this
02:35 - let's offset it by 1 on the x by -1 on
02:39 - the y
02:39 - we can also increase the softness to
02:41 - play the shadow a bit i think that looks
02:43 - a lot better let's also add a gradient
02:45 - to the text
02:46 - we do that under the font settings where
02:48 - it says color gradient we'll make sure
02:50 - to check that and we now configure a
02:52 - color for both the top left and right
02:54 - and the bottom left and right but
02:55 - instead of doing that in here since i
02:57 - want all of my text elements to share
02:59 - the same gradient we can create a color
03:01 - gradient asset
03:02 - to do that we'll go to the project right
03:04 - click go create
03:05 - text mesh pro and let's select color
03:07 - gradient let's rename this asset to
03:10 - gold and now we can define some colors
03:12 - and i have some color codes at the ready
03:14 - here so i'll simply paste these
03:15 - in i'm going to be using the same one
03:17 - for the top left and right
03:19 - and then for the bottom left and right
03:21 - we'll choose another one
03:23 - a bit darker this time so that's some
03:25 - nice yellow and orange colors
03:27 - let's now select our text object let's
03:28 - scroll to the gradient part and let's
03:30 - now drag in our
03:32 - gold object into the gradient preset
03:34 - slot and there we go we now have a nice
03:36 - gradient to our text
03:37 - let's rename this text to play and of
03:40 - course this is currently just a symbol
03:42 - text object
03:43 - we want to turn this into a button to do
03:45 - that let's right click on our canvas go
03:47 - ui and let's create
03:48 - a button let's start by scaling this
03:50 - button up and let's move it up as well
03:52 - for the image here we'll make that
03:54 - completely black and for now we'll just
03:55 - go ahead and disable it then under our
03:57 - button we'll notice a text object and
03:59 - this is what we want to replace with the
04:01 - play text that we just created
04:02 - so let's delete this text object and
04:04 - instead drag in our play text
04:06 - let's just rename this to text and
04:08 - instead rename our button to play button
04:12 - we now select our text object we'll
04:14 - click on the anchor presets at the top
04:16 - of the reg transform
04:17 - hold down alt and click on the bottom
04:20 - right corner this will snap our text to
04:22 - the center of our play button and make
04:24 - sure to always scale it to the same size
04:26 - as the button so now we should see that
04:28 - if we hit play we can actually press
04:31 - on our text however we don't actually
04:33 - see anything
04:34 - changing we need some visual feedback on
04:37 - what's going on
04:38 - to do that let's re-enable our image
04:40 - under the
04:41 - normal color let's go and change the
04:43 - alpha to zero
04:44 - then under highlighted color we'll
04:46 - definitely also decrease it but we do
04:48 - want it to be
04:49 - visible and when we then press the
04:51 - object we want it to be
04:53 - even clearer so with these settings if
04:55 - we try and hit play
04:56 - we should see that when we hover over
04:58 - our text the black box appears
05:00 - and when we click it it becomes even
05:02 - darker awesome
05:03 - we can of course change the size of the
05:05 - black box by adjusting this element so
05:07 - when we're happy with our button let's
05:08 - go ahead and duplicate
05:10 - it we'll click and drag while holding
05:11 - down shift to move it down on only one
05:13 - axis
05:14 - and this is going to be our options
05:16 - button so let's change the text to
05:18 - options let's also increase the width to
05:20 - make room for it and let's rename it to
05:23 - options button again we'll duplicate
05:25 - this hold down shift while moving it
05:27 - down
05:27 - and finally we want this to be our quit
05:29 - button again we'll resize it to only
05:31 - just fit our text
05:33 - and we then rename the button to quit
05:35 - button
05:36 - awesome so if we now hit play we should
05:38 - see that we're able to select
05:39 - three different buttons and that you can
05:41 - also use your keyboard to change between
05:43 - them
05:44 - of course our buttons currently don't do
05:46 - anything our play button should load the
05:48 - next scene
05:48 - our quit button should close the game
05:50 - and our options button should
05:52 - lead to another menu let's start by
05:54 - creating this menu to do that let's go
05:56 - to a canvas let's right-click
05:57 - and create an empty we'll rename this to
05:59 - our main menu
06:01 - let's also just size it up a bit this is
06:03 - going to contain all of our main menu
06:05 - elements
06:05 - so we can select all of our buttons and
06:07 - drag them under our main menu object
06:10 - let's then duplicate this object and
06:12 - let's rename this one
06:13 - to options menu let's disable the main
06:16 - menu
06:16 - now for this menu i don't want a lot of
06:18 - buttons but i do want
06:20 - it to say options at the top so i'm
06:22 - going to go under my options button
06:24 - take the text element alone and drag it
06:26 - to the top i'm then going to drag it up
06:28 - here where it says play
06:29 - and i'm going to delete both the play
06:30 - and options button the quit button we
06:32 - can turn into a
06:34 - back button let's call it back button
06:37 - and change the text to back i'll also
06:39 - decrease the text size to something like
06:42 - 50
06:42 - and we'll then resize it to fit and now
06:44 - we have some room where we can add
06:46 - our settings i'm just going to show you
06:47 - how to add a simple slider
06:49 - we'll right click on our options menu go
06:51 - ui and select
06:52 - slider let's definitely make this wider
06:55 - and a bit taller let's go into the
06:57 - slider
06:57 - find the handle and let's disable the
07:00 - image component
07:00 - we can then select our background and
07:03 - make this a neutral
07:04 - black let's also decrease the alpha to
07:06 - not make it stand out too much
07:08 - finally we can go under fill area and
07:10 - select fill and let's use the color
07:12 - picker here to get a nice color from our
07:14 - text
07:14 - now we should see if we hit play that
07:16 - we're able to adjust our slider to
07:18 - anything that we'd like
07:19 - let's also add a tiny text element
07:21 - telling what the slider does
07:23 - to that let's duplicate our text let's
07:25 - move this on top of the slider let's
07:27 - rename this to
07:28 - volume let's change the text to volume
07:31 - as well
07:31 - and let's decrease the font size to
07:33 - something like 32
07:35 - we now shrink down this element move it
07:37 - to our slider
07:38 - and let's align it to the left and we've
07:40 - now created a volume slider
07:42 - of course a slider doesn't change any
07:44 - settings if you want to know how to
07:45 - create a options menu in unity
07:47 - definitely let me know in the comments
07:49 - so now we have our two menus an options
07:51 - menu as well as a main menu
07:53 - all that's left is to add functionality
07:55 - to these two menus
07:56 - let's begin with the play button this is
07:58 - found under the main menu object
08:00 - but instead of adding a separate script
08:02 - for the play button itself
08:04 - let's add a script to the main menu
08:06 - object that will have functionality for
08:07 - all of our menu buttons
08:09 - let's hit add component let's write main
08:11 - menu let's create a new script of type c
08:14 - sharp
08:14 - create an ad let's double click it to
08:16 - open it up in visual studio
08:17 - now let's remove our start and update
08:20 - and instead let's create our own
08:21 - function that will call whenever we
08:23 - press the play button
08:24 - in order to be able to call it from the
08:25 - button we need to make the method public
08:27 - so we'll write public void let's call it
08:29 - play game
08:30 - and inside this method we'll simply load
08:32 - the next level whenever we want to
08:34 - change scenes in unity we need to be
08:36 - using
08:37 - unity engine that's scene management
08:40 - now we can simply go
08:42 - scenemanager.loadscene
08:44 - and here we could give it a name of the
08:45 - scene say level1
08:47 - we'd also give it a build index say 1
08:50 - but instead of loading a particular
08:52 - level let's simply load the next level
08:54 - in the queue to do that we get the index
08:57 - of our currently loaded level
08:58 - so scenemanager.getactivescene dot build
09:02 - index
09:03 - and we simply increase it by one so plus
09:06 - one
09:06 - if we now save this and go into unity we
09:09 - of course need to make sure that we add
09:11 - our scenes to the queue
09:12 - to do that we go file build settings and
09:15 - here we have all the scenes
09:16 - in our build first we want to add our
09:18 - menu so that has an index
09:20 - of 0 i will then add our game which has
09:22 - an index of 1.
09:23 - now the last thing we need to do is
09:25 - simply hook up our play button to the
09:27 - function that we just created
09:28 - to do that let's select the button let's
09:30 - scroll down to where it says
09:31 - on click this is a unity event we can
09:34 - add an action to this event by hitting
09:35 - the plus button
09:36 - we need to select an object that will be
09:38 - our main menus let's
09:40 - drag that in there now we can go and
09:41 - find our main menu script and under here
09:43 - we've created a function called play
09:45 - game
09:46 - and now if we play our game and press on
09:48 - the play button
09:49 - it loads the next scene which is our
09:51 - game even though currently maybe our
09:53 - menu is more fun
09:54 - so that's awesome the next button we'll
09:56 - hook up is the quit button
09:57 - again we can do this inside of the same
09:59 - script so we'll create another public
10:01 - void
10:02 - and this one we'll call quit game and
10:04 - this is even simpler we simply go
10:06 - application dot quit and that should
10:09 - close down the program
10:10 - however this won't happen inside of the
10:12 - unity editor so just to let ourselves
10:14 - know that this is working we'll throw
10:16 - debug.log
10:17 - and the message will be quit again let's
10:20 - go into unity
10:21 - let's select our quit button let's
10:23 - scroll down to the on click event
10:25 - let's add an action again we want to
10:27 - reference our main menu
10:28 - and the function that we want to call is
10:30 - under main menu and it's called
10:32 - quit game and again if we hit play and
10:34 - select quit
10:35 - we now see the quit message displayed in
10:37 - the console and i promise you that if
10:39 - you build this
10:40 - and try and do the same thing it will
10:42 - close down the program
10:43 - now the last button that's left is our
10:45 - options button that's because we don't
10:46 - want this to load another scene or
10:48 - quit the program we simply want this to
10:50 - change to another menu
10:51 - and we have that menu available right
10:53 - here it's just disabled so we don't
10:55 - actually need to do any programming
10:56 - we simply select the options button
10:58 - scroll down to the on click event
11:00 - add an action and here we can simply
11:01 - reference our options menu directly
11:04 - then as the function will go under game
11:06 - object i will choose the set
11:07 - active function this is a really awesome
11:10 - part of the unity ui events the fact
11:12 - that we can call functions on unity
11:13 - components
11:14 - and then we can choose whether or not we
11:15 - want the game object to be enabled and
11:17 - in this case we do
11:18 - but we also need to disable our main
11:20 - menu so we'll just add another action
11:22 - this time we'll reference our main menu
11:24 - we'll again go under game object choose
11:26 - set active and this time we want it to
11:28 - be
11:28 - false so if we now play the game and
11:30 - select our options
11:32 - we can see that our main menu gets
11:33 - disabled and our options menu gets
11:36 - enabled and here we are in our options
11:38 - menu of course we also need to be able
11:40 - to transition
11:41 - back using the back button to do that
11:43 - we'll go under the options menu
11:44 - select our back button add an action and
11:47 - here we want to reference our main menu
11:49 - go under game object you guessed it
11:51 - we'll select set active and we'll set
11:53 - that to true
11:54 - and then we want to disable our options
11:56 - menu so we'll add another action
11:58 - drag in the options menu go game object
12:00 - set active
12:01 - and this time false and that completes
12:03 - our menu
12:04 - we can go quit in order to quit the game
12:07 - we can go
12:07 - options in order to go into our options
12:09 - menu and adjust our volume
12:10 - we can select back and then we can press
12:13 - play and it puts us into the game

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to have a look at how to create a cool main menu inside of unity at the end it should look something like this special thanks to hansoftoon duderman and armando rusi for their support on patreon and now let's make a menu so i currently have two scenes a menu one which is completely empty and a game one just pretend that you're seeing a game here now inside of our menu scene let's begin by creating the ui let's right click in our hierarchy go ui and select panel this will create a canvas and inside of this canvas it will create a panel now i want to go under image and replace the source image i've imported my own background image here that we can drag in you can choose to use any sprite here just make sure that when you select it under texture type it's set to sprite 2d and ui then under our panel let's go to color and let's amp up the alpha channel so now we have a nice backdrop for our menu let's rename it to background and at this point we're ready to add some text let's right click on our canvas go ui select text and of course we could just use unity's default text here we could scale it up center it change the font size change the color but that's about the control that we have if you want to change the font we need to import some custom fonts we can't add nice looking shadows or gradients and for most menus that i've created i definitely want to have these options so instead let's delete this text object and let's import a free package called text mesh pro so let's go to the asset store search for text mesh pro i'll of course have a link for this in the description let's select the pack here this pack was recently acquired by unity and i've created a separate video on how to use it so if you find something confusing along the way definitely check that out for now we can just hit download or import and we'll hit import again and after it's done you should see a folder in your project panel called text mesh pro now we can go back to our scene view we can right click on our canvas go ui and you should now see an option here called text mesh pro text and right off the bat we can see that the text renders a lot more clearly let's go into the font size here and let's change it to something like 84. let's also give our text some room i'll hold down alt to scale from the center let's make sure to align our text to the center both horizontally and vertically now instead of new text we'll write play with capital letters and i'm also going to change the font asset to roboto bold and i think we can make this even more bold so that's also on the font style check off the b here that looks pretty good but currently it's just a plain white to change this let's scroll down onto the material settings let's first add an underlay in order to create a shadow let's enable this let's offset it by 1 on the x by 1 on the y we can also increase the softness to play the shadow a bit i think that looks a lot better let's also add a gradient to the text we do that under the font settings where it says color gradient we'll make sure to check that and we now configure a color for both the top left and right and the bottom left and right but instead of doing that in here since i want all of my text elements to share the same gradient we can create a color gradient asset to do that we'll go to the project right click go create text mesh pro and let's select color gradient let's rename this asset to gold and now we can define some colors and i have some color codes at the ready here so i'll simply paste these in i'm going to be using the same one for the top left and right and then for the bottom left and right we'll choose another one a bit darker this time so that's some nice yellow and orange colors let's now select our text object let's scroll to the gradient part and let's now drag in our gold object into the gradient preset slot and there we go we now have a nice gradient to our text let's rename this text to play and of course this is currently just a symbol text object we want to turn this into a button to do that let's right click on our canvas go ui and let's create a button let's start by scaling this button up and let's move it up as well for the image here we'll make that completely black and for now we'll just go ahead and disable it then under our button we'll notice a text object and this is what we want to replace with the play text that we just created so let's delete this text object and instead drag in our play text let's just rename this to text and instead rename our button to play button we now select our text object we'll click on the anchor presets at the top of the reg transform hold down alt and click on the bottom right corner this will snap our text to the center of our play button and make sure to always scale it to the same size as the button so now we should see that if we hit play we can actually press on our text however we don't actually see anything changing we need some visual feedback on what's going on to do that let's reenable our image under the normal color let's go and change the alpha to zero then under highlighted color we'll definitely also decrease it but we do want it to be visible and when we then press the object we want it to be even clearer so with these settings if we try and hit play we should see that when we hover over our text the black box appears and when we click it it becomes even darker awesome we can of course change the size of the black box by adjusting this element so when we're happy with our button let's go ahead and duplicate it we'll click and drag while holding down shift to move it down on only one axis and this is going to be our options button so let's change the text to options let's also increase the width to make room for it and let's rename it to options button again we'll duplicate this hold down shift while moving it down and finally we want this to be our quit button again we'll resize it to only just fit our text and we then rename the button to quit button awesome so if we now hit play we should see that we're able to select three different buttons and that you can also use your keyboard to change between them of course our buttons currently don't do anything our play button should load the next scene our quit button should close the game and our options button should lead to another menu let's start by creating this menu to do that let's go to a canvas let's rightclick and create an empty we'll rename this to our main menu let's also just size it up a bit this is going to contain all of our main menu elements so we can select all of our buttons and drag them under our main menu object let's then duplicate this object and let's rename this one to options menu let's disable the main menu now for this menu i don't want a lot of buttons but i do want it to say options at the top so i'm going to go under my options button take the text element alone and drag it to the top i'm then going to drag it up here where it says play and i'm going to delete both the play and options button the quit button we can turn into a back button let's call it back button and change the text to back i'll also decrease the text size to something like 50 and we'll then resize it to fit and now we have some room where we can add our settings i'm just going to show you how to add a simple slider we'll right click on our options menu go ui and select slider let's definitely make this wider and a bit taller let's go into the slider find the handle and let's disable the image component we can then select our background and make this a neutral black let's also decrease the alpha to not make it stand out too much finally we can go under fill area and select fill and let's use the color picker here to get a nice color from our text now we should see if we hit play that we're able to adjust our slider to anything that we'd like let's also add a tiny text element telling what the slider does to that let's duplicate our text let's move this on top of the slider let's rename this to volume let's change the text to volume as well and let's decrease the font size to something like 32 we now shrink down this element move it to our slider and let's align it to the left and we've now created a volume slider of course a slider doesn't change any settings if you want to know how to create a options menu in unity definitely let me know in the comments so now we have our two menus an options menu as well as a main menu all that's left is to add functionality to these two menus let's begin with the play button this is found under the main menu object but instead of adding a separate script for the play button itself let's add a script to the main menu object that will have functionality for all of our menu buttons let's hit add component let's write main menu let's create a new script of type c sharp create an ad let's double click it to open it up in visual studio now let's remove our start and update and instead let's create our own function that will call whenever we press the play button in order to be able to call it from the button we need to make the method public so we'll write public void let's call it play game and inside this method we'll simply load the next level whenever we want to change scenes in unity we need to be using unity engine that's scene management now we can simply go scenemanager.loadscene and here we could give it a name of the scene say level1 we'd also give it a build index say 1 but instead of loading a particular level let's simply load the next level in the queue to do that we get the index of our currently loaded level so scenemanager.getactivescene dot build index and we simply increase it by one so plus one if we now save this and go into unity we of course need to make sure that we add our scenes to the queue to do that we go file build settings and here we have all the scenes in our build first we want to add our menu so that has an index of 0 i will then add our game which has an index of 1. now the last thing we need to do is simply hook up our play button to the function that we just created to do that let's select the button let's scroll down to where it says on click this is a unity event we can add an action to this event by hitting the plus button we need to select an object that will be our main menus let's drag that in there now we can go and find our main menu script and under here we've created a function called play game and now if we play our game and press on the play button it loads the next scene which is our game even though currently maybe our menu is more fun so that's awesome the next button we'll hook up is the quit button again we can do this inside of the same script so we'll create another public void and this one we'll call quit game and this is even simpler we simply go application dot quit and that should close down the program however this won't happen inside of the unity editor so just to let ourselves know that this is working we'll throw debug.log and the message will be quit again let's go into unity let's select our quit button let's scroll down to the on click event let's add an action again we want to reference our main menu and the function that we want to call is under main menu and it's called quit game and again if we hit play and select quit we now see the quit message displayed in the console and i promise you that if you build this and try and do the same thing it will close down the program now the last button that's left is our options button that's because we don't want this to load another scene or quit the program we simply want this to change to another menu and we have that menu available right here it's just disabled so we don't actually need to do any programming we simply select the options button scroll down to the on click event add an action and here we can simply reference our options menu directly then as the function will go under game object i will choose the set active function this is a really awesome part of the unity ui events the fact that we can call functions on unity components and then we can choose whether or not we want the game object to be enabled and in this case we do but we also need to disable our main menu so we'll just add another action this time we'll reference our main menu we'll again go under game object choose set active and this time we want it to be false so if we now play the game and select our options we can see that our main menu gets disabled and our options menu gets enabled and here we are in our options menu of course we also need to be able to transition back using the back button to do that we'll go under the options menu select our back button add an action and here we want to reference our main menu go under game object you guessed it we'll select set active and we'll set that to true and then we want to disable our options menu so we'll add another action drag in the options menu go game object set active and this time false and that completes our menu we can go quit in order to quit the game we can go options in order to go into our options menu and adjust our volume we can select back and then we can press play and it puts us into the game yay that's pretty much it for this video if you
