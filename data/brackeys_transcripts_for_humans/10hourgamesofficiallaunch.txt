00:15 - hour games is let me explain why it's
00:18 - awesome you should participate in 10
00:20 - hour games to inspire new developers
00:24 - while putting your own skills to the
00:26 - test many developers including myself
00:28 - tend to spend way too much time thinking
00:30 - about what games to make and how long
00:32 - it's going to take to make them 10 hour
00:35 - games is not a competition but a paper
00:37 - away for people to stop thinking and
00:39 - just get cracking on whatever game they
00:41 - want to make I hope that people will be
00:43 - able to try out a bunch of ideas and
00:45 - discover more efficient techniques for
00:48 - future projects
00:49 - hence the tight deadlines so 10 hour
00:51 - games is all about getting creative
00:53 - collaborating with other developers
00:55 - growing your skills and just having fun
00:58 - the rules are simple
00:59 - start a 10 hour countdown once
01:01 - development kicks off and export the
01:04 - final build when the timer runs out you
01:07 - can use any software if you're liking
01:09 - unity UDK game maker or whatever you can
01:14 - also just pause the countdown and
01:16 - continue at a later time as long as you
01:19 - stick to the ten work hours of
01:20 - development the idea of the event is
01:23 - that it's not a competition but a way
01:25 - for people to bring ideas to live in an
01:27 - entertaining and educated way though to
01:30 - kick things off I will feature the first
01:33 - five games submitted and if you make
01:35 - something really cool you have a chance
01:37 - to get featured too if you feel you have
01:39 - unanswered questions please visit
01:41 - brackish calm / 10 hour games to read
01:45 - more about the event you can also play
01:48 - my own submission at brekkie Starcom /
01:51 - flappy cow that was pretty much it so
01:53 - good luck and I'm looking very much
