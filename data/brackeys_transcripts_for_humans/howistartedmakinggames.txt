00:00 - I've always been fascinated by video
00:01 - games especially the ones without any
00:04 - clear objective my favorite kind was
00:06 - sandbox games because they wouldn't tell
00:08 - you what to do instead you had to come
00:10 - up with ideas on your own and often
00:12 - these games would give a glimpse into
00:14 - what it might feel like to make it game
00:15 - yourself I remember spending hours upon
00:18 - hours in Garry's Mod trying to figure
00:20 - out the intricacies of how the engine
00:22 - worked to this day I still considered
00:24 - one of the greatest games ever made
00:26 - exactly because it wasn't a game it was
00:29 - something more I was always on the
00:31 - lookout for a new sandbox game or mod
00:33 - that I could delve into I went from
00:35 - powder game - Gary smart to Warcraft 3
00:38 - World Editor
00:39 - he has spent months making custom
00:41 - tower-defense maps and just goofing
00:43 - around with the engine but I still
00:44 - wanted to make a game of my own and it's
00:46 - fun as some of these tools were I just
00:48 - wanted something simple that would allow
00:50 - me to do that so I downloaded unity
00:52 - thanks to have the awesome pigeon all
00:53 - right the story is not over unity was
00:55 - still in early stages at this point and
00:57 - no one had really heard about it instead
00:59 - I picked up game maker not game maker
01:01 - studio as you know it back then it was
01:03 - well different game maker was fun but I
01:07 - quickly found myself searching for
01:08 - something more especially because I
01:10 - wanted to experiment with 3d for this
01:12 - reason I started using blender now those
01:15 - of you who've been following this
01:16 - channel for a while probably know that
01:18 - I'm a terrible 3d modeler seriously it's
01:21 - bad so instead of failing at making
01:24 - realistic renders I embarked upon
01:25 - blenders visual scripting solution and
01:28 - actually succeeded in making a few
01:30 - smaller games of course the visuals were
01:32 - made up of cubes but still we all have
01:34 - to start somewhere but something about
01:36 - programming visually didn't feel right
01:38 - this was probably mostly because of how
01:40 - limited blenders no they did it was back
01:42 - then regardless I couldn't get the idea
01:44 - of writing real code out of my head so I
01:47 - experimented with Python Visual Basic
01:49 - and HTML but at this point I didn't
01:52 - really get programming in fact it seemed
01:54 - unnecessarily hard and I always ended up
01:57 - feeling bored by it
01:58 - I wished like many others before me that
02:01 - I could make a game without having to
02:02 - think about programming so I teamed up
02:04 - with some friends we've all beginners
02:06 - back then in fact we were still kids but
02:08 - we had ideas and weren't afraid to try
02:10 - them out together we had a 3d modeler
02:12 - a Java programmer a character artist and
02:15 - then of course me I wanted to be the one
02:17 - that brought it all together and since
02:19 - we decided on using unity there was no
02:21 - other way than to learn how to use it
02:23 - ironically I started by watching YouTube
02:25 - tutorials back then the biggest channel
02:27 - making videos on unity was tornado twins
02:30 - some of you might remember these guys
02:31 - with that help I was able to put
02:33 - together a prototype for a first game
02:35 - awake an ambitious ambience based 3d
02:41 - side scroller with puzzles and
02:43 - platforming mechanics of course to no
02:45 - one's surprise spin complete beginners
02:47 - we might have bit off more than we could
02:49 - chew
02:49 - so having learned nothing from our
02:51 - mistake we moved on to an even bigger
02:53 - project your game inspired by a love for
02:56 - sandbox games we set out to make a game
02:58 - where the players make their own games
03:00 - this time we managed to get the core
03:02 - gameplay working and I was starting to
03:04 - really enjoy scripting finally
03:06 - programming was beginning to make sense
03:07 - for me now I still couldn't write two
03:09 - lines of code without a gazillion errors
03:11 - but hey I still wrote those two lines of
03:13 - code and working on your game is
03:15 - actually also how I got into making
03:16 - tutorials back then we didn't have a
03:18 - marketing budget in fact we didn't have
03:20 - a budget at all so we needed a way to
03:22 - let people know about our game once it
03:24 - got released so I thought what better
03:25 - way to build an audience of people
03:27 - interested in sandbox games than by
03:29 - making tutorials so I started my first
03:32 - series on creating a survival game in
03:33 - unity completely unknowing that my first
03:35 - video ever would have over a million
03:37 - views only a few years later and in
03:40 - truth I had no idea what I was doing
03:41 - back then but I think out of all game
03:43 - developers that's the most common thing
03:45 - learning as you go game development is a
03:48 - bit like jumping into the water before
03:50 - knowing how to swim all you can do is
03:52 - hope that somehow you find a way to
03:54 - float but that's also what makes it so
03:56 - exciting all projects are different and
03:58 - with each one comes to a new set of
04:00 - challenges that are even more
04:01 - complicated than the previous ones
04:03 - it's exciting but it's also easy to lose
04:05 - track sometimes you just have to remind
04:07 - yourself to look back at how far you've
04:09 - come I still remember the thrill of
04:11 - getting the character moving around the
04:13 - screen in fact I still get some of that
04:14 - thrill when I do the same thing now but
04:17 - thankfully the end result is a lot
04:18 - better and in five years I'll probably
04:20 - look back at the games I've made lately
04:22 - and think of a million ways they could
04:23 - be improved
04:24 - I guess we'll just have to wait and see
04:27 - text of the awesome patreon supporters
