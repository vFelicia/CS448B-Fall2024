00:00 - yes so GDC is over and man did it come
00:07 - with a lot of exciting news we were
00:09 - really fortunate to be part of the
00:10 - conference special thanks to unity for
00:13 - inviting us we really had a great time
00:15 - now during GDC
00:16 - we got to see previews of a bunch of
00:18 - upcoming unity features and a lot of
00:20 - them actually really surprised me so in
00:22 - this video we'll have a look at what's
00:23 - coming to unity in 2018 so things kicked
00:27 - off with the Unity keynote after the
00:29 - opening speech from John Riccitiello
00:31 - it went right into machine learning here
00:33 - we got to see a cool demo of how you can
00:35 - use machine learning to teach the AI in
00:37 - a racing game how to steer by simply
00:40 - getting a human to play the game which
00:42 - we can see on the left the AI will
00:44 - slowly pick up on how to navigate
00:45 - through the level as seen on the right
00:47 - normally you would have to program all
00:50 - this behavior by hand which is not only
00:52 - time consuming but often leads to very
00:54 - unnatural and robotic feeling AI next up
00:57 - we got a quick overview of the release
00:59 - scheduled for 2018 unit is planning
01:02 - three major releases which you can see
01:04 - here 2018 point one is mostly focused on
01:07 - artists and rendering capability as
01:09 - we've already seen with the announcement
01:11 - of shader graph and SRP according to
01:14 - unity they want to keep working on these
01:15 - two themes for the remaining year in
01:18 - 2018 point two we can expect to see a
01:20 - bunch of new features like a vector
01:22 - graphics importer 2d character animation
01:25 - as well as new asset bundle tools and it
01:28 - was already at this point in the
01:29 - presentation that I fell off my chair
01:31 - never ever had I thought this would
01:34 - happen it felt like my entire life had
01:37 - been leading up to this moment let me
01:40 - give you a hint that's right
01:43 - it's finally here
01:45 - ready three two one
01:50 - all right that's that's not it but we
01:53 - have nested prefabs now to those of you
01:57 - who aren't in on the joke unity has been
02:00 - promising nested prefabs for a really
02:02 - long time without getting into too much
02:04 - detail nested prefabs really expand on
02:07 - the usefulness of prefabs by allowing us
02:09 - to parent prefabs to each other we'll
02:11 - definitely make a video on this once we
02:14 - know more from here they went on to talk
02:16 - about the new rendering features most of
02:18 - this had already been announced but
02:19 - still they showed some really impressive
02:21 - stuff from the Book of the Dead demo
02:23 - using the HD render pipeline mostly what
02:26 - caught my eye was support for really
02:28 - high in rendering features like
02:29 - subsurface scattering real time area
02:32 - lights and volumetric sky occlusion and
02:34 - the most insane thing was that
02:36 - everything was running on a Playstation
02:38 - 4 Pro pretty crazy the presentation then
02:41 - moved on to a tiny demo of shader graph
02:43 - and finally yo Keem jumped on stage to
02:45 - talk a bit about performance and the
02:47 - future of programming in unity most
02:50 - importantly he announced that the entity
02:52 - component system is now available in
02:54 - preview which is definitely exciting and
02:56 - at this point I thought well that was it
02:59 - the keynote got wrapped up everybody
03:01 - went home but just the morning after
03:04 - there was a talk on the Unity 2018
03:07 - roadmap and holy Wow did they announce a
03:09 - lot of new features first of all Andrew
03:11 - showed off some demo footage of the 2d
03:13 - character animation and support for
03:15 - vector graphics he also talked about
03:17 - sprite shape which is a new tool for
03:20 - creating spline based layouts and levels
03:22 - in 2d he then went on to text mesh Pro
03:25 - which will be more tightly integrated
03:27 - with the editor timeline is getting some
03:29 - tools for faster editing cinema Sheen is
03:31 - getting a storyboard feature to quickly
03:32 - test out ideas by overlaying references
03:35 - and sketches and just as I thought he
03:37 - was running out of stuff BAM
03:39 - new node based video effects editor now
03:41 - we don't know a lot about this yet but
03:43 - I'm just really excited about this one
03:45 - and finally the terrain system is also
03:48 - getting an update again we don't know
03:50 - much yet but apparently it's getting a
03:52 - UI overhaul with better brush painting
03:54 - as well as a performance boost something
03:56 - that is definitely needed
03:58 - this point also to those of you who
03:59 - don't know unity is working on a new
04:01 - launcher called unity hub it's currently
04:04 - available in preview and will definitely
04:05 - be a nice addition especially to those
04:08 - who are working with multiple versions
04:10 - of unity and that's pretty much all we
04:12 - had to cover for this video I would love
04:14 - to hear what feature you guys the most
04:15 - excited about for 2018 on that thanks
04:18 - for watching and I will see you in the
04:20 - next video thanks to have the awesome
