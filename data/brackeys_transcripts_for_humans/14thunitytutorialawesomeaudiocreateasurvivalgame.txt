00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to the 14th
00:05 - video in our create a survival game
00:08 - series done by brais I am the CEO of
00:11 - braies and today we are going to be
00:13 - taking a look at another method for
00:16 - making audio and underlying music for
00:19 - your game so we're going to apply some
00:22 - smooth fading between audio sources so
00:26 - um let's go ahead and open up
00:28 - Unity um this is generally a better
00:32 - method than what I showed you in the
00:34 - last tutorial though um it does have its
00:38 - faults and I'm going to talk about them
00:41 - very very soon so um first off let's
00:45 - talk about what we made last time we had
00:47 - these two audio zones um with a 2d audio
00:52 - attached to them and a script that
00:55 - handled all of the um switching on and
00:59 - off so basically once the player insert
01:03 - these triggers these trigger colliders
01:05 - the music would start playing and when
01:07 - he left them it would stop this didn't
01:11 - uh give the effect of smooth fading and
01:14 - um it was not really nice so um let's go
01:19 - ahead and for now just disable these by
01:22 - selecting them in the hierarch key and
01:25 - hitting uh this check boox so now we can
01:29 - see they great out out they are disabled
01:32 - great um the reason why I showed you
01:34 - these in the first place was so that you
01:37 - can get an understanding out of how
01:40 - audio zones Works inside of unity and
01:43 - also um it's really great to know how to
01:46 - make trigger
01:47 - functionality um it's good for making
01:51 - all different kinds of surprising events
01:53 - or just um make making sure that your
01:57 - game stays
01:58 - alive um Okay cool so let's go ahead and
02:02 - clean up from our last tutorial drag the
02:05 - audio Zone script under the scripts
02:07 - folder and we are ready to go now hit
02:10 - the game object create empty or you can
02:14 - just press contrl shift n to make a an
02:18 - empty game object you can go ahead and
02:21 - right click and rename this to uh audio
02:25 - Zone optimized I'm just going to write
02:28 - opt or uh Source or whatever you want
02:32 - I'm going to write Ops and then Z one so
02:36 - very similar to what we did before I'm
02:39 - going to zero up the
02:42 - transform and place it basically in the
02:47 - center of our
02:50 - village all right so now I'm going to
02:52 - hit the add component on the white right
02:55 - hand side and uh go on the audio and
02:59 - then and hit the audio
03:01 - Source this is going to again add the
03:04 - audio Source component built into Unity
03:07 - into our game now we want something to
03:10 - start playing and this is very similar
03:12 - to the uh tutorial we did last time now
03:16 - though now we are going to start uh to
03:19 - see some changes so if I double click
03:21 - our audio folder I have changed
03:24 - something with these audio
03:26 - files if I select the friendly music
03:29 - first example you can see what I've
03:32 - changed the 3D sound is now enabled this
03:36 - is because I want these to act as a
03:40 - three-dimensional sound actually placed
03:43 - in somewhere in the scene um so that
03:46 - Unity can take care of the rollof or the
03:50 - linear fading um uh for us so we don't
03:54 - need to do this through
03:56 - scripting and this is really great for
03:59 - stuff like
04:00 - background music or
04:03 - um or at least if you want to change it
04:06 - based on the player position then it's
04:08 - really great for background music it's
04:10 - great for environmental things um St
04:14 - stuff like wind blowing or um water
04:18 - splashing from the sea you get the idea
04:22 - all right so you can go ahead and check
04:24 - that 3D sound and hit the apply keep in
04:27 - mind that if your file is way too to B
04:29 - for games like mine uh my files is or
04:33 - are um then it could take quite a while
04:36 - for it to convert but um be patient uh
04:40 - it should work so now let's go under our
04:44 - audio Zone
04:46 - optimized and drag in the for example
04:49 - friendly
04:51 - music drag it
04:54 - in
04:56 - um I guess I'll just select it some how
04:59 - my dragon isn't working oh there we go
05:02 - now it's fixed um so we have the
05:06 - friendly music and it says this is the
05:08 - 3D sound exactly how we want it we want
05:11 - the play on awake to be Set uh to
05:14 - true and we could go ahead and uh play
05:19 - around with some of the 3D sound
05:21 - settings so right when you add it it
05:24 - should look like this if we go ahead and
05:26 - expand the 3D sound settings you can see
05:29 - see a whole lot of system uh or audio
05:32 - settings come up there are a lot of
05:36 - things that we can trick here so if we
05:38 - go ahead and just hit play right
05:41 - now the piece starts playing and once we
05:45 - get closer to the source it gets a lot
05:48 - louder and if we rotate
05:51 - around you can hear it coming from
05:54 - different places in the room uh this
05:56 - might not be very clear to you but if
05:58 - you are sitting uh listening to this
06:01 - with a headset or
06:04 - um or multiple speakers uh you will be
06:08 - able to notice this and uh for the most
06:11 - part with music uh you don't quite want
06:14 - it to move between speakers um so we're
06:18 - going to fix some of these
06:20 - problems now first of all uh we want the
06:24 - piece to stay equally loud uh throughout
06:28 - our town we don't want it to uh decrease
06:32 - in its Audio Level or pitch um depending
06:36 - on where we are in the town so therefore
06:39 - we're going to change the minimum
06:41 - distance so let's take the minimum
06:43 - distance and drag it up and you can also
06:47 - see this happening inside of scene view
06:50 - you can also select one of these dots
06:53 - and drag it inside the scene
06:56 - view this gives a very nice visual
07:00 - representation of the minimum distance
07:05 - before the rolloff
07:07 - begins and that's what this is all about
07:10 - this is about creating the rolloff or
07:13 - the fading um in in the
07:17 - audio whether whether it's linear or
07:22 - logarithmic and logarithmic simply means
07:25 - that it's has a curve in its listener
07:30 - whereas if we change it to linear you
07:33 - can see that it changes the volume in a
07:37 - straight
07:38 - line all right so um you can have
07:41 - whatever you want here um I'm going to
07:43 - go ahead and change it to linear just to
07:45 - make this a little easier to explain and
07:48 - show
07:49 - off okay so um now that we have this set
07:53 - um we could go ahead and change the max
07:55 - distance so if we um change bump down
07:58 - the max distance
08:00 - quite a bit we should in a moment start
08:02 - to see the blue sphere and there it
08:06 - is so what this means uh with the
08:10 - current settings that we have is that
08:13 - when uh inside of this smaller sphere
08:17 - the music will be equally loud no matter
08:20 - where we are when we get right outside
08:23 - it it will start decreasing in until we
08:28 - hit this
08:30 - outer sphere then it will be completely
08:33 - gone so if we go ahead and bump up the
08:36 - max distance quite a bit we can make the
08:41 - fading um a lot slower but if we leave
08:45 - it here um I can just illustrate so let
08:48 - me go ahead and hit play the music is
08:50 - very
08:51 - loud and it stays equally loud no matter
08:55 - where we are in the Inner Circle now I
08:57 - start leaving the Inner Circle and you
08:59 - can hear it fading until it's completely
09:03 - disappeared one thing though uh and this
09:06 - is the problem with doing it through the
09:09 - 3D audio handling in
09:11 - unity this is also why I showed you the
09:15 - audio Zone uh done through scripting
09:18 - because yes this has does indeed have a
09:23 - problem and uh it can be quite difficult
09:27 - to hear when especially because I'm
09:29 - recording this with just one microphone
09:32 - but whenever we are inside of our
09:37 - town and we
09:40 - rotate you can hear that we get this
09:43 - feeling of the audio flying by really
09:46 - fast and also the the audio is panning
09:51 - from the left to right
09:54 - speaker so um this is not too great for
10:00 - doing music it can be wonderful for
10:03 - stuff like um splashing of the sea but
10:08 - um especially with music you want to
10:11 - keep it equally loud uh until you want
10:14 - it to fade away so let's go ahead and uh
10:17 - change the doer level and the doler
10:22 - level is
10:24 - um well
10:26 - it it um it adjusts the effectiveness of
10:33 - the doo effect and if you don't know the
10:35 - doo effect it's basically whenever we
10:39 - move or rotate quickly the sound gets
10:44 - pitched up and down so the sound gets
10:49 - adjusted and uh it can sound really
10:52 - weird when we are moving quickly or
10:55 - rotating quickly that's basically the
10:57 - doppo effect so um this will just change
11:00 - how much um the doler effect is going to
11:03 - influence our sound and we want that to
11:07 - stay at zero for the
11:09 - music but we can still
11:12 - hear that
11:15 - uh it's not quite gone it does still pan
11:19 - from one speaker to the other and then
11:22 - you might say well there's a pan level
11:24 - adjustment why don't we just change that
11:27 - to zero let's see what happens so I hit
11:31 - play try to run out of the circle it
11:34 - should fade
11:36 - away it doesn't the pan level is not
11:40 - does not just uh don't doesn't just
11:44 - adjust the um the panning it also
11:49 - adjusts how well uh Unity will handle 3D
11:53 - sounds in general so this is how much
11:56 - this audio source is going to be
11:58 - affected by the the 3D sound
12:01 - engine and that means logarithmic
12:04 - falloff or linear rolloff as
12:07 - well so
12:09 - [Music]
12:10 - um that's quite a bummer um though I
12:14 - have come out up with a a technique to
12:17 - uh kind of blur this a little bit so
12:20 - blur the line and not make it quite as
12:23 - um well bad as um it it would be anyways
12:28 - because the pan level can just as the
12:30 - linear rollof in this volume um it can
12:34 - be animated so let's go ahead and do
12:37 - this so here we have the Green Line This
12:41 - is the pan level and I can go ahead and
12:43 - drag this down a little bit um the xaxis
12:47 - here is the distance from the center of
12:52 - this audio
12:53 - source so you can see 0 5 10 this is 0
12:57 - units 5 units 10 units and so on until
13:02 - we reach um the end or the max distance
13:06 - which is currently set to 32 so that is
13:09 - half far way we are and uh the y axis is
13:14 - the influence of stuff like volume pan
13:17 - level and spread and spread I won't be
13:20 - explaining it's not very necessary for
13:23 - this kind of audio
13:26 - configuration so um let's go ahead and
13:29 - and adjust the pan level uh depending on
13:32 - where we are and how far away we are
13:35 - from the
13:37 - source so if we go ahead and double
13:40 - click this will create a new
13:43 - point and uh you can adjust the curve of
13:46 - this by using um this um this point
13:51 - right here but we are really just going
13:54 - to be messing around with the uh
13:57 - position of the point itself so if we go
13:59 - ahead and drag this up and place
14:03 - it uh right about uh maybe a little
14:07 - after the uh fading Begins the downwards
14:13 - fading uh this will mean that when the
14:17 - audio starts fading out we want to be
14:20 - able to hear this so therefore we want
14:23 - the pan level we want the effectiveness
14:26 - of the 3D audio engine to be full but
14:30 - until then we really don't care about
14:32 - the 3D engine so we are going to take
14:35 - the other point here and drag it all the
14:37 - way down and this way we achieve
14:41 - something like
14:44 - this so when I'm inside the city I can
14:48 - rotate and jump and run all I want it
14:52 - won't change the audio at all but when
14:55 - we start getting out to the fading it
14:58 - will actually Fade
15:00 - Away now this still doesn't change that
15:04 - when you're in the fading Zone you can
15:07 - hear the
15:08 - audio being weird you can hear the
15:11 - actual panning but I think it's a pretty
15:15 - good solution it's definitely better
15:17 - than the very harsh switching you um
15:21 - will most of the time get with uh
15:24 - scripting audio else you have to get
15:26 - into uh the distance from the uh game
15:29 - objects and some volume changing um I'm
15:33 - sure you can come up with an algorithm
15:35 - but for now this will do so let's go
15:38 - ahead and actually try to implement
15:40 - something awesome so uh let's drag out
15:43 - the uh max distance to make the fading a
15:48 - lot um smoother and uh slower and let's
15:53 - hear how this sounds so right now we're
15:55 - inside the city and uh I forgot to do
15:58 - one thing so hit stop I forgot to adjust
16:02 - the um the pan level also so we have to
16:07 - drag this back whenever we drag drag the
16:12 - um uh drag drag the the fall off back so
16:16 - um adjust this also and whoops I made a
16:20 - mistake there so quickly create these
16:22 - key frames one more time and uh let's
16:26 - have a
16:27 - listen
16:29 - oh needs to be a little lower try
16:34 - again indeed no changes inside of the
16:38 - city and then the music will slowly and
16:42 - beautifully start fading away and one
16:45 - thing I actually like about this panning
16:48 - is that you can feel the music coming
16:50 - from the town so if we um if we imagine
16:55 - that our player is coming from over here
16:58 - here from another town or has been in a
17:01 - fight um and we then close up on the
17:04 - village we can start hearing slowly the
17:08 - uh music playing and uh it it let us
17:12 - know that we are back
17:14 - home now I could change this to
17:16 - logarithmic rollof to get quite a nicer
17:20 - effect and create some more uh key
17:23 - frames on this adjust them to get a
17:26 - nicer looking
17:27 - curve uh but this is just some tweaking
17:31 - and I'm pretty sure you can do this on
17:32 - your own so um that's the gist of it we
17:36 - could go ahead and duplicate this audio
17:38 - Zone and call it audio Zone optimized
17:42 - 2 check off the play on awake um no
17:46 - actually leave that on um my bad and you
17:50 - might also want to set these both to a
17:54 - loop and then we could just drag this
17:57 - over to another part of the
18:02 - map let's say over there so if we follow
18:05 - the
18:08 - road we follow the
18:11 - road
18:12 - um we should hear the first piece fading
18:16 - out and as soon as we get down here we
18:20 - should start hearing the uh second piece
18:23 - fading in and this way you can create uh
18:26 - different feelings to different parts of
18:29 - your
18:30 - environment there we go I forgot to
18:33 - change which pie piece this uh this
18:37 - audio Zone will be playing so we can
18:39 - just drag the enemy territory in here
18:41 - instead and um this should be working so
18:45 - that's basically it for the audio Zone
18:48 - creation one thing though if you want
18:50 - the enemy to send out scary sounds or if
18:55 - you want battle music like The
18:57 - frightening kind of music or um or stuff
19:01 - like that to play whenever we near the
19:03 - enemy you can simply take the audio Zone
19:07 - U with the frightening music and drag it
19:09 - onto the enemy and position it on him
19:12 - and therefore it's parented on him so
19:14 - whenever we get near him we can hear um
19:18 - these uh this piece of music playing so
19:21 - that's a cool tip for engaging and also
19:24 - letting the player know that he's near
19:27 - something uh something bad so uh that's
19:31 - it for audio uh thank you for watching
19:34 - and uh one more thing before we wrap
19:38 - this up um I have asked a question on
19:42 - Facebook for what you would like to see
19:44 - in future tutorials um I'm currently
19:47 - working on a collision mastering Collis
19:50 - tutorial uh it's going to be really
19:53 - really cool and uh I also have a lot of
19:56 - different stuff um on the list you can
20:00 - see here I have written everything down
20:02 - every request I have gotten um but I
20:05 - would like to get some more feedback so
20:07 - if there's something you want to see or
20:09 - something you want to vote vote up uh go
20:11 - ahead and uh type in facebook.com/
20:14 - braies and you can go ahead and answer
20:16 - the question um let me uh know what you
20:19 - guys want so thanks for watching and

hello everyone and welcome to the 14th video in our create a survival game series done by brais I am the CEO of braies and today we are going to be taking a look at another method for making audio and underlying music for your game so we're going to apply some smooth fading between audio sources so um let's go ahead and open up Unity um this is generally a better method than what I showed you in the last tutorial though um it does have its faults and I'm going to talk about them very very soon so um first off let's talk about what we made last time we had these two audio zones um with a 2d

audio zones Works inside of unity and also um it's really great to know how to make trigger functionality um it's good for making all different kinds of surprising events or just um make making sure that your game stays alive um Okay cool so let's go ahead and clean up from our last tutorial drag the audio Zone script under the scripts folder and we are ready to go now hit the game object create empty or you can just press contrl shift n to make a an empty game object you can go ahead and right click and rename this to uh audio Zone optimized I'm just going to write opt or uh Source or whatever you want I'm going to write Ops and then Z one so very similar to what we did before I'm going to zero up the transform and place it basically in the center of our village all right so now I'm going to hit the add component on the white right hand side and uh go on the audio and then and hit the audio Source this is going to again add the audio Source component built into Unity into our game now we want something to start playing and this is very similar to the uh tutorial we did last time now though now we are going to start uh to see some changes so if I double click our audio folder I have changed something with these audio files if I select the friendly music first example you can see what I've changed the 3D sound is now enabled this is because I want these to act as a

um St stuff like wind blowing or um water splashing from the sea you get the idea all right so you can go ahead and check that 3D sound and hit the apply keep in mind that if your file is way too to B for games like mine uh my files is or are um then it could take quite a while for it to convert but um be patient uh it should work so now let's go under our audio Zone optimized and drag in the for example friendly music drag it in um I guess I'll just select it some how my dragon isn't working oh there we go now it's fixed um so we have the friendly music and it says this is the 3D sound exactly how we want it we want the play on awake to be Set uh to true and we could go ahead and uh play around with some of the 3D sound settings so right when you add it it should look like this if

right now the piece starts playing and once we get closer to the source it gets a lot louder and if we rotate around you can hear it coming from different places in the room uh this might not be very clear to you but if you are sitting uh listening to this with a headset or um or multiple speakers uh you will be able to notice this and uh for the most part with music uh you don't quite want it to move between speakers um so we're going to fix some of these problems now first of all uh we want the piece to stay equally loud uh throughout our town we don't want it to uh decrease in its Audio Level or pitch um depending on where we are in the town so therefore we're going to change the minimum distance so let's take the minimum distance and drag it up and you can also see this happening inside of scene view you can also select one of these dots and drag it inside the scene view this gives a very nice visual representation of the minimum distance before the rolloff begins and that's what this is all about this is about creating the rolloff or the fading um in in the audio whether whether it's linear or logarithmic and logarithmic simply means that it's has a curve in its listener whereas if we change it to linear you can see that it changes the volume in a straight line all right so um you can have whatever you want here um I'm going to go ahead and change it to linear just to make this a little easier to explain and show off okay so um now that we have this set um we could go ahead and change the max distance so if we um change bump down the max distance quite a bit we should in a moment start to see the blue sphere and there it is so what this means uh with the current settings that we have is that when uh inside of this smaller sphere the music will be equally loud no matter where we are when we get right outside it it will start decreasing in until we hit this outer sphere then it will be completely gone so if we go ahead and bump up the max distance quite a bit we can make the fading um a lot slower but if we leave it here um I can just illustrate so let me go ahead and hit play the music is very loud and it stays equally loud no matter where we are in the Inner Circle now I start leaving the Inner Circle and you can hear it fading until it's completely disappeared one thing though uh and this is the problem with doing it through the 3D audio handling in unity this is also why I showed you the audio Zone uh done through scripting because yes this has does indeed have a problem and uh it can be quite difficult to hear when especially because I'm recording this with just one microphone but whenever we are inside of our town and we rotate you can hear that we get this feeling of the audio flying by really fast and also the the audio is panning from the left to right speaker so um this is not too great for doing music it can be wonderful for stuff like um splashing of the sea but um especially with music you want to keep it equally loud uh until you want it to fade away so let's go ahead and uh change the doer level and the doler level is um well it it um it adjusts the effectiveness of the doo effect and if you don't know the doo effect it's basically whenever we move or rotate quickly the sound gets pitched up and down so the sound gets adjusted and uh it can sound really weird when we are moving quickly or rotating quickly that's basically the doppo effect so um this will just change how much um the doler effect is going to influence our sound and we want that to stay at zero for the music but we can still hear that uh it's not quite gone it does still pan from one speaker to the other and then you might say well there's a pan level adjustment why don't we just change that to zero let's see what happens so I hit play try to run out of the circle it should fade away it doesn't the pan level is not does not just uh don't doesn't just adjust the um the panning it also adjusts how well uh Unity will handle 3D sounds in general so this is how much this audio source is going to be affected by the the 3D sound engine and that means logarithmic falloff or linear rolloff as well so um that's quite a bummer um though I have come out up with a a technique to uh kind of blur this a little bit so blur the line and not make it quite as um well bad as um it it would be anyways because the pan level can just as the linear rollof in this volume um it can be animated so let's go ahead and do this so here we have the Green Line This is the pan level and I can go ahead and drag this down a little bit um the xaxis here is the distance from the center of this audio source so you can see 0 5 10 this is 0 units 5 units 10 units and so on until we reach um the end or the max distance which is currently set to 32 so that is half far way we are and uh the y axis is the influence of stuff like volume pan level and spread and spread I won't be explaining it's not very necessary for this kind of audio configuration so um let's go ahead and and adjust the pan level uh depending on where we are and how far away we are from the source so if we go ahead and double click this will create a new point and uh you can adjust the curve of this by using um this um this point right here but we are really just going to be messing around with the uh position of the point itself so if we go ahead and drag this up and place it uh right about uh maybe a little after the uh fading Begins the downwards fading uh this will mean that when the audio starts fading out we want to be able to hear this so therefore we want the pan level we want the effectiveness of the 3D audio engine to be full but until then we really don't care about the 3D engine so we are going to take the other point here and drag it all the way down and this way we achieve something like this so when I'm inside the city I can rotate and jump and run all I want it won't change the audio at all but when we start getting out to the fading it will actually Fade Away now this still doesn't change that when you're in the fading Zone you can hear the audio being weird you can hear the actual panning but I think it's a pretty good solution it's definitely better than the very harsh switching you um will most of the time get with uh scripting audio else you have to get into uh the distance from the uh game objects and some volume changing um I'm sure you can come up with an algorithm but for now this will do so let's go ahead and actually try to implement something awesome so uh let's drag out the uh max distance to make the fading a lot um smoother and uh slower and let's hear how this sounds so right now we're inside the city and uh I forgot to do one thing so hit stop I forgot to adjust the um the pan level also so we have to drag this back whenever we drag drag the um uh drag drag the the fall off back so um adjust this also and whoops I made a mistake there so quickly create these key frames one more time and uh let's have a listen oh needs to be a little lower try again indeed no changes inside of the city and then the music will slowly and beautifully start fading away and one thing I actually like about this panning is that you can feel the music coming from the town so if we um if we imagine that our player is coming from over here here from another town or has been in a fight um and we then close up on the village we can start hearing slowly the uh music playing and uh it it let us know that we are back home now I could change this to logarithmic rollof to get quite a nicer effect and create some more uh key frames on this adjust them to get a nicer looking curve uh but this is just some tweaking and I'm pretty sure you can do this on your own so um that's the gist of it we could go ahead and duplicate this audio Zone and call it audio Zone optimized 2 check off the play on awake um no actually leave that on um my bad and you might also want to set these both to a loop and then we could just drag this over to another part of the map let's say over there so if we follow the road we follow the road um we should hear the first piece fading out and as soon as we get down here we should start hearing the uh second piece fading in and this way you can create uh different feelings to different parts of your environment there we go I forgot to change which pie piece this uh this audio Zone will be playing so we can just drag the enemy territory in here instead and um this should be working so that's basically it for the audio Zone creation one thing though if you want the enemy to send out scary sounds or if you want battle music like The frightening kind of music or um or stuff like that to play whenever we near the enemy you can simply take the audio Zone U with the frightening music and drag it onto the enemy and position it on him and therefore it's parented on him so whenever we get near him we can hear um these uh this piece of music playing so that's a cool tip for engaging and also letting the player know that he's near something uh something bad so uh that's it for audio uh thank you for watching and uh one more thing before we wrap this up um I have asked a question on Facebook for what you would like to see in future tutorials um I'm currently working on a collision mastering Collis tutorial uh it's going to be really really cool and uh I also have a lot of different stuff um on the list you can see here I have written everything down every request I have gotten um but I would like to get some more feedback so if there's something you want to see or something you want to vote vote up uh go ahead and uh type in facebook.com/ braies and you can go ahead and answer the question um let me uh know what you guys want so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video n
