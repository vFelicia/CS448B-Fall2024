With timestamps:

00:00 - most of the time when making a game you
00:01 - don't have a huge art team at your
00:03 - disposal that means it's important to
00:05 - think about the ways that you can reduce
00:06 - the amount of time you spend on art and
00:09 - tell based artwork can be a great way of
00:10 - creating simple elements that can be
00:12 - reused over and over again so in this
00:15 - video we'll have a look at creating tile
00:16 - sets in Photoshop also special thanks to
00:19 - Judy Minh bevy oh you Rio Murr hence
00:21 - Huff tune and infinite PP art for their
00:23 - support on patreon and with that let's
00:25 - get painting so before we start creating
00:26 - our own tile set it's probably a good
00:28 - idea that we define what it is because
00:30 - when it comes to tile based graphics
00:31 - there are a lot of terms being thrown
00:33 - around so here are a bunch of examples
00:36 - of Charles a tile is basically just a
00:39 - small image usually rectangular that
00:42 - acts like a puzzle piece of art for
00:44 - building larger images you could imagine
00:46 - how it could combine some of these tiles
00:48 - to create pretty interesting levels a
00:50 - tile set is a collection of tiles that
00:53 - work together so you can see I have four
00:55 - different tasks that I've gone ahead and
00:57 - copied and rotated in various ways and
01:00 - together they make a tile set using this
01:02 - tile set we can paint maps or
01:04 - environments like this one so I quickly
01:06 - put this together using unity spilled in
01:08 - tile map editor and you can see how
01:10 - using only these simple elements we can
01:12 - quickly put together a level you can see
01:15 - a huge number of tile sets made for
01:17 - Mario there's one set for ordinary
01:19 - platforms one force and style platforms
01:22 - one for snowy platforms icy platforms
01:25 - and so on oh well this image is what we
01:27 - call a tile Atlas an Atlas is basically
01:29 - just a collection of all of your tiles
01:32 - packed closely together so this is just
01:34 - one big image containing a bunch of
01:36 - smaller images so now that we have the
01:38 - terminology in place it's time to start
01:40 - creating our own tile set and to make
01:42 - this easier I've gone ahead and created
01:43 - a Photoshop tile set template that you
01:46 - can use I'll of course have a download
01:48 - link for this in the description
01:49 - let's now double click it to open it up
01:51 - in Photoshop and here's what it looks
01:53 - like as you can see we have four
01:54 - different tasks we have the side tile
01:57 - the corner tile the filler and the inner
01:59 - corner by placing and rotating only
02:01 - these four tiles we can create full-on
02:04 - environments I've also included a few
02:06 - examples of how these tiles look when
02:09 - stacked next to each other you can see
02:10 - here that we check how outer rounding
02:12 - looks how in around
02:14 - looks how all of the corner tiles look
02:16 - together and how the sides tile this way
02:18 - you can really ease the check if your
02:19 - pattern is too recognizable and if you
02:21 - have any weird looking seams if you want
02:24 - to go ahead and edit a tile or create
02:26 - one from scratch we simply need to find
02:28 - the corresponding layer down here in the
02:30 - layers panel so I want to start with the
02:32 - side tile and so I'll double-click on
02:34 - this side tile layer this is going to
02:36 - open it up in a separate window let's go
02:38 - ahead and zoom in and this tile is made
02:40 - using pixel art if you've never made pix
02:42 - a lot before I have a tutorial for pixel
02:44 - art in Photoshop that you can check out
02:46 - so in here I have a bunch of different
02:47 - layers I have some grass and some dirt
02:50 - let's try and create a new layer let's
02:52 - go to the left here hold down on the
02:54 - brush tool and select pencil tool it's
02:57 - right click and make sure to set the
02:58 - size to 1 and now if we try and paint
03:01 - something onto a texture here save it
03:03 - and go back to the tile set template we
03:05 - can see that all of this side tiles
03:08 - update accordingly and so we can really
03:10 - easily preview your changes of course
03:12 - this doesn't look too good so I'm gonna
03:13 - go ahead and remove it and in fact I
03:15 - want to start from scratch and show you
03:17 - kind of what my process looks like so
03:19 - I'm gonna select our grass and dirt
03:20 - folders and delete them and now we have
03:23 - a blank canvas to paint on I also want
03:25 - to be able to preview my changes without
03:27 - switching back and forth so I'm going to
03:29 - take the breakage tile set template drag
03:32 - it out I'm going to zoom out a bit and
03:34 - make the window fit and now we can duct
03:36 - this in the top right corner of our
03:37 - screen and at this point we're ready to
03:39 - start painting away just to make sure
03:41 - that everything is working I'm going to
03:43 - do a quick smiley face here and when I
03:45 - save this we can see that things are
03:47 - working so the first thing that we want
03:48 - to do is lay out the foundation of our
03:50 - tile and the main thing to think about
03:52 - here is how will it look once our tile
03:54 - repeats in general we want to make sure
03:56 - that what we paint on the left hand side
03:58 - of our image corresponds to what we
04:00 - paint on the right hand side of our
04:02 - image this way we won't get any weird
04:04 - scenes we also want to avoid
04:05 - highlighting a particular part of our
04:08 - tau because in general this will create
04:10 - a very clear pattern and therefore
04:11 - revealed that our tile is repeating so
04:14 - if I go ahead and draw a line that goes
04:16 - like this and say that you can see that
04:19 - this is very clearly repeating the line
04:21 - doesn't add up and that's of course
04:23 - because the left hand side and right
04:24 - hand side of our tile do not match
04:27 - whereas if I were to draw a line like
04:29 - this we can see that when I save we get
04:32 - a uniform line without any breaks
04:34 - so I'm gonna select a basic grass color
04:36 - and I'm gonna lay the foundation for our
04:38 - grass now even though this doesn't look
04:44 - like grass at all yet it's a good idea
04:47 - to try and save your changes and see how
04:49 - it does because we want to make sure
04:51 - that before we start adding detail the
04:53 - overall layout of our tile works and as
04:55 - you can see it actually repeats fairly
04:57 - nicely I do I really think that this
04:59 - pointy bit right here stands out a bit
05:01 - and this is actually where we see our
05:03 - timing let's try and remove that there
05:05 - we go now it's much harder to see where
05:07 - tiles we also notice that if I go ahead
05:09 - and add a very clear piece of detail
05:11 - right here as I said before this will
05:13 - make it very clear that the texture is
05:15 - repeating I think the result speaks for
05:17 - itself here so try and make it as
05:18 - uniform as possible without it getting
05:20 - too boring so now we can add some
05:22 - highlight to our grass this is probably
05:24 - also where I should say that I'm not an
05:26 - artist and so you will have to excuse my
05:28 - artistic skills but hopefully you'll
05:29 - learn something anyways so I'm gonna
05:31 - select a lighter green this time add a
05:33 - new layer and I'll see you in a second
05:42 - so this looks all right and we can go
05:44 - ahead and add another layer of
05:45 - highlighter so I think that's actually
05:49 - fine for our grass now it's time to add
05:52 - some dirt for this I'm gonna select a
05:54 - light brown color I'm gonna go to the
05:56 - left here and hold down on our shape
05:57 - tool to select the rectangle tool and
05:59 - then gonna click and drag to fill out
06:01 - the entire bottom part of our image and
06:03 - it's also drag the layer to the bottom
06:05 - if we now save this we can see that it
06:07 - starts to look like a tile but
06:09 - everything currently looks very flat
06:11 - that's because we need to add some
06:13 - shadow to our grass I'm also going to
06:15 - rename some of these layers to stay
06:17 - organized so right above our dirt base
06:24 - let's add another layer and for the
06:27 - shadow of our grass I want to select a
06:29 - darker green but I also want to make it
06:31 - more blue let's figure shadows in
06:33 - general or tinted a bit blue let's go to
06:35 - the top here and select our color and
06:37 - I'm gonna paint in some shadows I'm
06:40 - gonna call it grass shadow and I'm
06:42 - actually also going to add a layer to
06:44 - the top which I'm also going to call
06:46 - grass shadow and that's just because I
06:48 - want to define it a bit more towards the
06:50 - top of our image here I'm also making
06:53 - the shadows spill in a bit towards the
06:55 - center this makes it feel less like a
06:57 - block of grass and more organic let's
06:59 - save this you can see that definitely
07:01 - help things along but our image still
07:03 - looks very 2-dimensional that's because
07:05 - we've only added shadow to our actual
07:07 - grass we also want a bunch of shadows
07:09 - bleeding onto the dirt and maybe even
07:11 - some detail in the dirt itself let's go
07:14 - ahead and add another layer let's call
07:16 - it dirt shadow light let's choose a
07:19 - darker brown
07:21 - as you can see this definitely helps pop
07:24 - we need a darker color still that's
07:26 - great another layer on top of that let's
07:28 - call it dirt shadow dark and I'm gonna
07:30 - select an even darker Brown
07:32 - [Music]
07:36 - I'm finally once you're satisfied we can
07:39 - add a tiny bit of detail to our third
07:41 - base of course we could go in and paint
07:43 - this manually but I found a very easy
07:45 - way to do this is by using noise if we
07:47 - duplicate our do it base by hitting ctrl
07:49 - J or command J if you're on the Mac we
07:52 - can go to the top here under filter we
07:54 - can then go under noise and hit add
07:56 - noise then it's going to ask you if you
07:58 - want to convert it to a smart object or
08:00 - raster rights the image we can just
08:01 - rasterize it and now we can add noise to
08:04 - our image I'm gonna select uniform make
08:06 - sure it's just like monochromatic if you
08:08 - only want your noise to be black and
08:09 - white we and then choose an amount I
08:10 - think this is fine around three percent
08:12 - and hit OK now this definitely already
08:15 - makes the dirt look more interesting but
08:18 - I think it looks way too much like noise
08:20 - however if you hit control T we can
08:22 - scale it up a bit and this makes it seem
08:25 - less like noise and more like a pattern
08:27 - so if we're now safe we can see it has a
08:29 - nice bit of grain to our texture we can
08:31 - right click and delete the vector mask
08:33 - here and instead we can go in and remove
08:36 - the dirt at the top here and it can also
08:38 - be a good idea to remove a bit of the
08:41 - noise along the sides here just to make
08:43 - it tile more evenly there we go there
08:45 - are plenty of stuff that you could still
08:47 - do to this but if we try and fullscreen
08:49 - our tile set template we've actually
08:51 - created a side tile and the exact same
08:53 - techniques applied to all of the oddly
08:55 - tiles for the corner tile here what I
08:57 - recommend doing is actually using your
08:59 - side tile as a base if we go ahead and
09:02 - disable all the layers that are already
09:03 - there we can go into our side tile we
09:06 - can select all the layers in here right
09:08 - click go to placate layers paste them
09:11 - into our corner tile we then switch over
09:13 - to our corner tile what are them
09:15 - recommend doing is grouping these so
09:17 - we'll hit the folder icon or press
09:19 - ctrl-g we can then duplicate this entire
09:22 - group by hitting ctrl J will then use
09:24 - ctrl T and rotate it by 90 degrees so
09:27 - I'm holding down shift to rotate in
09:29 - increments then we can go under the
09:31 - group on top here and remove our two
09:33 - dirt based layers you can see it already
09:35 - kind of starts to look like a corner we
09:38 - then go to the bottom here and make sure
09:40 - our third base here only goes in the
09:43 - actual corner and remove anything from
09:46 - the third base noise layer here I bump
09:48 - up the size on this
09:49 - so we can get rid of all of it so all
09:51 - this around here and then it's just
09:53 - about removing parts of the image so
09:55 - we'll go to the group on top here we'll
09:57 - take all of our dirt shadow dark here
09:59 - and remove it for this part do the same
10:02 - thing with the dirt shadow light and the
10:04 - same thing with the grass shadow and you
10:06 - can see it starts to blend together like
10:08 - a corner of course you'll probably want
10:09 - to add a bit of detail to round things
10:11 - out and maybe also remove some of the
10:13 - base in the actual corner itself here
10:16 - but if we were to preview it it's
10:18 - actually not too bad
10:19 - of course definitely clean it up add
10:21 - more detail and overall just have fun
10:24 - with it but that is the basics of
10:25 - creating tile sets in Photoshop so
10:27 - that's pretty much it for this video if

Cleaned transcript:

most of the time when making a game you don't have a huge art team at your disposal that means it's important to think about the ways that you can reduce the amount of time you spend on art and tell based artwork can be a great way of creating simple elements that can be reused over and over again so in this video we'll have a look at creating tile sets in Photoshop also special thanks to Judy Minh bevy oh you Rio Murr hence Huff tune and infinite PP art for their support on patreon and with that let's get painting so before we start creating our own tile set it's probably a good idea that we define what it is because when it comes to tile based graphics there are a lot of terms being thrown around so here are a bunch of examples of Charles a tile is basically just a small image usually rectangular that acts like a puzzle piece of art for building larger images you could imagine how it could combine some of these tiles to create pretty interesting levels a tile set is a collection of tiles that work together so you can see I have four different tasks that I've gone ahead and copied and rotated in various ways and together they make a tile set using this tile set we can paint maps or environments like this one so I quickly put this together using unity spilled in tile map editor and you can see how using only these simple elements we can quickly put together a level you can see a huge number of tile sets made for Mario there's one set for ordinary platforms one force and style platforms one for snowy platforms icy platforms and so on oh well this image is what we call a tile Atlas an Atlas is basically just a collection of all of your tiles packed closely together so this is just one big image containing a bunch of smaller images so now that we have the terminology in place it's time to start creating our own tile set and to make this easier I've gone ahead and created a Photoshop tile set template that you can use I'll of course have a download link for this in the description let's now double click it to open it up in Photoshop and here's what it looks like as you can see we have four different tasks we have the side tile the corner tile the filler and the inner corner by placing and rotating only these four tiles we can create fullon environments I've also included a few examples of how these tiles look when stacked next to each other you can see here that we check how outer rounding looks how in around looks how all of the corner tiles look together and how the sides tile this way you can really ease the check if your pattern is too recognizable and if you have any weird looking seams if you want to go ahead and edit a tile or create one from scratch we simply need to find the corresponding layer down here in the layers panel so I want to start with the side tile and so I'll doubleclick on this side tile layer this is going to open it up in a separate window let's go ahead and zoom in and this tile is made using pixel art if you've never made pix a lot before I have a tutorial for pixel art in Photoshop that you can check out so in here I have a bunch of different layers I have some grass and some dirt let's try and create a new layer let's go to the left here hold down on the brush tool and select pencil tool it's right click and make sure to set the size to 1 and now if we try and paint something onto a texture here save it and go back to the tile set template we can see that all of this side tiles update accordingly and so we can really easily preview your changes of course this doesn't look too good so I'm gonna go ahead and remove it and in fact I want to start from scratch and show you kind of what my process looks like so I'm gonna select our grass and dirt folders and delete them and now we have a blank canvas to paint on I also want to be able to preview my changes without switching back and forth so I'm going to take the breakage tile set template drag it out I'm going to zoom out a bit and make the window fit and now we can duct this in the top right corner of our screen and at this point we're ready to start painting away just to make sure that everything is working I'm going to do a quick smiley face here and when I save this we can see that things are working so the first thing that we want to do is lay out the foundation of our tile and the main thing to think about here is how will it look once our tile repeats in general we want to make sure that what we paint on the left hand side of our image corresponds to what we paint on the right hand side of our image this way we won't
