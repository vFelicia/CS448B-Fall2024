00:00 - this video is brought to you by our own
00:01 - Metta thank you so much for donating if
00:03 - you want to support breakage yourself
00:04 - you can go to patreon.com/scishow cheese
00:06 - thanks for tuning in at brac ease hello
00:11 - everyone and welcome to this video and
00:12 - creating a multi-player fears in unity
00:14 - today we will do a bunch of different
00:15 - stuff so we'll be fixing some box we'll
00:18 - get rid of some warnings we'll be adding
00:20 - a cursor lock to the game so when we're
00:23 - not in some kind of menu and we're in
00:24 - actually playing we will get rid of the
00:27 - cursor and censored in the middle of the
00:29 - screen so it won't get in the way and
00:31 - we'll also be adding a joint room
00:33 - timeout so if you try to join a room but
00:35 - for some reason you aren't successful it
00:38 - will just count down from X amount of
00:40 - setting seconds and when it reaches zero
00:42 - it will just stop and say failed and you
00:45 - can try and join another one so yeah
00:48 - some exciting stuff also will mention
00:50 - that since the last video I have created
00:52 - a the first video in game theory which
00:55 - is patreon funded because we reached
00:57 - level two and I think it turned out
01:00 - really well this one is on vectors so if
01:02 - you're interested in that you can click
01:03 - the link now and without further ado
01:05 - let's jump right into it so you can see
01:08 - that I'm community and the first thing
01:10 - that I want to get rid of it's just all
01:12 - of these annoying warnings that are
01:15 - there as soon as we put up our projects
01:17 - and these are because of the
01:18 - cross-platform input initialized script
01:21 - that is part of the standard assets that
01:24 - we've imported so let's just double
01:26 - click that and basically in Visual
01:28 - Studio and this is super nice it
01:30 - underlines all of the all of the parts
01:34 - that we can just go ahead and get rid of
01:36 - so everything with these Green Wave's
01:38 - under them we're just going to remove
01:40 - that we can get rid of this one and
01:44 - these one and basically this doesn't
01:49 - really matter but if you want to get rid
01:52 - of the warnings this is the way to go
01:55 - it's because some of these like the vp8
01:59 - and blackberry are obsolete so let's
02:02 - just save that and you can see that that
02:04 - should clear out our console so that's
02:06 - really nice and another warning that I
02:09 - want to get rid of is when we go in here
02:11 - and create a game
02:12 - here and he created room you can see it
02:15 - says the reference script and this
02:17 - behavior is missing and that is just
02:19 - because if we go to our and find our
02:23 - prefabs and then the I believe it's the
02:27 - fire it's much it might not be under our
02:30 - prefab so let's just double-click this
02:31 - and it should select it so this is also
02:33 - under standard assets we should just go
02:35 - ahead and remove this empty script right
02:37 - there and I believe that that should fix
02:40 - both of them so now when we clear out
02:42 - the console here hit play and try and
02:45 - create another room here you can see
02:47 - that we have serial warning so that is
02:50 - perfect so the next thing that I wanted
02:53 - to do and I've actually gone ahead and
02:54 - compiled a little list here of things
02:56 - that I wanted to do so that was the
02:58 - warnings it's fix the host game
03:01 - disconnect buck and that basically means
03:03 - that if we try and hit play here and we
03:06 - want to create a room room and we hit
03:09 - create room and we then leave this room
03:12 - and try to host a new one test create
03:15 - room you can see nothing is happening
03:17 - here and the reason why is that we have
03:20 - now lost the connection from our modules
03:24 - host game create room button here you
03:27 - can see that the on click event here
03:29 - doesn't have any connection to any
03:31 - object and the reason why is that the
03:34 - functionality for that sits on our
03:36 - network manager and our network manager
03:39 - is transferred on to the next scene and
03:42 - so when we go back here it has lost that
03:45 - connection
03:45 - so what we will do instead is we'll just
03:47 - copy this host game component and remove
03:49 - it from the network manager and create
03:52 - an empty game object that will just
03:54 - reset the transform on and whoops if I
03:57 - can stop dragging out the lighting there
03:59 - and we will call this one host game and
04:01 - we can then just paste that component
04:05 - back in as new just the way that we did
04:07 - it with our join game and you can of
04:10 - course make those on the same object but
04:12 - I'll just go ahead and separate them out
04:14 - into two different ones and then under
04:16 - our canvas modules host game create room
04:19 - button we can now drag host game under
04:21 - that on click event go under host game
04:23 - and here
04:24 - create room and we'll have to do the
04:26 - same with the room name input so you can
04:28 - see there's also an on value changed
04:30 - here
04:31 - dragon host game go host game and then
04:34 - let's select the set room name as a
04:37 - dynamic string so we will pass in
04:40 - whatever is in the input field so that
04:42 - should indeed get rid of that bug there
04:45 - so now if we try and create a first room
04:48 - hit create room and we leave that room
04:51 - and try and create a second room here
04:54 - you can see that that now just simply
04:57 - works except it took a bit of time there
05:01 - but it actually works so that's fine
05:02 - cool so the next thing that I wanted to
05:05 - go ahead and do is fix the spawn bug and
05:09 - I'm actually going to add another thing
05:11 - here and that is the spawn menu continue
05:14 - button I think we should have one of
05:15 - those so now let's begin by fixing this
05:18 - spawn bug and what I'm talking about
05:19 - here will become very much more apparent
05:22 - if we go and find our main menu and we
05:27 - have the nice level here and we take
05:29 - find our spawn points here so focus in
05:32 - on those you can see that we have one on
05:34 - the ground here we have one another one
05:37 - on the ground here and then we have one
05:39 - on top of these platforms and it is when
05:42 - we spawn on top of these platforms that
05:44 - this bug becomes very apparent so let's
05:46 - just try and disable all of the other
05:48 - spawn points except that except for the
05:50 - third one here and let's see what
05:52 - happens if we now go back into our lobby
05:55 - and try and create a game let's try and
05:58 - create a test room here and you can see
06:00 - that we spawn on top of this but you can
06:02 - see that currently we are flying a lot
06:05 - higher above the ground that we normally
06:07 - would so we have this weird kind of
06:10 - offset position and the reason why is
06:13 - actually really simple it is that if we
06:15 - find our player and find our
06:17 - configurable joint component you can see
06:21 - that we have currently set it to auto
06:23 - configure connected anger and that means
06:25 - that the kind of the anger point from
06:29 - where we do all of our configure will
06:32 - join our calculations will be set
06:35 - depending on where I respond so if we
06:36 - spawn at a higher
06:37 - point it will be set higher and that is
06:40 - not something we want we want this to be
06:42 - fixed so we'll just remove that all
06:44 - right uncheck that and then we'll have
06:47 - the connected anger be zero one zero so
06:50 - that we will be anchored at one unit
06:53 - above the surface so if we now try and
06:55 - hit play here and this should actually
06:57 - work so let's just create a room here
07:00 - and you can see that we're now standing
07:01 - on the platform correctly and we jump
07:03 - down and everything seems to be working
07:07 - cool so that got rid of that bug and
07:11 - that was all for that cool so now we can
07:16 - go ahead and add a spawn menu into our
07:18 - or that is not correct I wanted to say
07:23 - add pause menu continue there we go so
07:26 - right now when we are in our game here
07:28 - if we go under our main level and we
07:30 - need to re-enable all of our spawn
07:32 - points here and we drag in our prefab
07:35 - player UI and we enable our past menu
07:40 - and let's shift to 2d mode and hit F to
07:42 - focus in on this you can see that we
07:44 - only have one button which is the lead
07:46 - room I basically want to add just
07:48 - another button that very simply
07:50 - continues the game instead of leaving so
07:53 - that we don't have to use the Escape key
07:56 - in case the user
07:57 - I don't know forgets or accidentally
08:00 - opens the boss menu and yeah it's just a
08:03 - cleaner way to do UI to have a button
08:05 - there as well
08:06 - so the first thing I want to do here is
08:08 - just bump down the redness of this
08:10 - button I think it's a bit too much
08:12 - something like that looks better
08:14 - and now let's duplicate this and we can
08:17 - rename this one to continue button and
08:21 - we can take this and drag it up to be
08:24 - right above and we can change the color
08:27 - here to something darker like a dark
08:30 - gray and let's go ahead and change the
08:32 - text as well here to continue we can
08:35 - select both buttons and we can maybe
08:37 - drag them down to center them and then
08:40 - we can take our continue button move it
08:42 - up here and let's now change this on
08:44 - click event so under our past menu is
08:48 - where we currently call a function
08:49 - called Lee
08:50 - room but we don't have a function in
08:53 - here for toggling the spawn menu or post
08:56 - menu I keep doing that on and off that's
08:58 - actually sits under I'll play a UI
09:00 - script so under I'll play UI you can see
09:03 - we have a toggle pass menu and all we
09:06 - really need to do is make this public
09:07 - for us to be able to go to a continue
09:10 - button and access it from there so if
09:13 - we're now dragging our player UI and
09:15 - going to play a UI and then whoops not
09:18 - send match message upwards I want to go
09:21 - toggle pause menu and it should actually
09:23 - be that symbol so if we now hit apply on
09:26 - this and remove the player UI again and
09:29 - hit and we cannot hit play directly we
09:32 - have to go through the lobby here so
09:34 - let's find a lobby here hit play and
09:36 - let's create a test room and when we now
09:39 - and we just have to wait for it to
09:42 - actually join here okay so okay I forgot
09:45 - to disable the post menu here so let's
09:48 - say find our player UI let's find our
09:52 - pass menu and we'll just have that
09:53 - disabled by default so let's hit play
09:55 - again here and try that out so create a
09:59 - room and when we go into the past menu
10:01 - now you can see that we can continue or
10:03 - leave the room and if we decide to
10:05 - continue we just jump right back into
10:07 - the game however you can see multiple
10:10 - problems with this at the moment one is
10:12 - that we are able if we open the past
10:15 - menu while holding down a key we'll keep
10:18 - moving that in that direction and also
10:20 - the same with the mouse so if I drag
10:22 - around here and over the past menu you
10:24 - can see that we don't lose that momentum
10:26 - so let's fix that along with adding in a
10:30 - cursor lock which was also the next
10:34 - point here cool so in order to do this
10:36 - what I want to bring up is our player
10:39 - and find the player controller so in Hue
10:43 - undo our update method we have a check
10:46 - to see if the past menu is currently on
10:49 - what I want to do is right below this
10:51 - that means whenever we aren't past I
10:54 - want to check to see if our cursor is
10:57 - locked and if it is not then we should
10:59 - go ahead and lock it right away
11:01 - so I'm going to go if
11:03 - and then we can go cursor dot a lock
11:07 - state and if that is not equal to cursor
11:11 - lock mode dot locked and you can see we
11:14 - have three options here we have confined
11:16 - which means that well the curse is
11:19 - confined to the game and window but it
11:21 - can move anywhere inside the game window
11:23 - we have locked which basically just sets
11:25 - it to the center of the game we know and
11:27 - we have none which means that it can
11:30 - move as it wants to so if it's not
11:32 - locked then we want to say cursor dot
11:36 - lock state equals cursor mode or cursor
11:40 - lock mode locked there we go and if we
11:44 - are past so if past menu dot is on well
11:48 - then we can go ahead and disable that so
11:49 - let's we still want to return from all
11:51 - of this but right before we return we
11:54 - can say if cursor lock mode or cursor
11:59 - dot lock state is not equal to cursor
12:04 - lock mode none well then we want to set
12:08 - cursor dot lock state equal to cursor
12:14 - lock mode dot none there we go so and of
12:18 - course this check is somewhat
12:20 - unnecessary you could just go ahead and
12:21 - set it but it's just a bit cleaner not
12:25 - setting it every single frame but one
12:27 - thing that we will have to set every
12:29 - single frame is motored odd move is what
12:32 - we can then say and then we can pass in
12:34 - vector 3.0 and that just means that we
12:38 - will stay in place and we'll do the same
12:40 - with motor rotate vector 3.0 and
12:45 - remember we also had a separate function
12:47 - for rotating the camera up and down so
12:49 - we'll have a motor rotate camera and
12:52 - that only takes in a float which is
12:54 - going to be serum so this will allow us
12:56 - to stay in place so if we now try and
12:59 - hit play here and join a room and test
13:03 - room you can see our cursor immediately
13:06 - disappears so that's perfect if I escape
13:08 - here it comes back and you can see that
13:11 - that just works and also if we try and
13:14 - move our camera here you can see that
13:16 - immediate
13:17 - stops when we hit the passkey and if we
13:20 - try and move it the same thing happens
13:22 - so that is perfect and that is working
13:26 - cool so I believe that was all we wanted
13:30 - to do with the cursor the last thing
13:34 - that I wanted to add in this video is a
13:36 - joint game timer because currently we
13:39 - are using the matchmaking system that
13:42 - unity gives us the Unity matchmaker and
13:45 - that's working fine however one annoying
13:48 - thing is that when you try and when you
13:51 - create a room and you the host then
13:53 - leaves making that room not joinable and
13:56 - you then try to reconnect or other
13:59 - clients try to reconnect just after the
14:01 - host leaves the room won't be cleaned up
14:04 - so it will still appear under the join
14:06 - room list here but it's not actually
14:09 - joinable and it won't cost any errors
14:11 - but it will just say joining joining
14:13 - joining pretty much forever until you
14:17 - hit the refresh button and I think that
14:19 - is bad UI so instead we should tell the
14:21 - user what is going on by having some
14:24 - kind of countdown and when it reaches 0
14:27 - will say failed and then we'll return to
14:29 - everything to normal so the way to do
14:32 - this is by going on to our joint game
14:34 - script and double click that and we will
14:36 - find the function down here called join
14:39 - room and this is basically called
14:42 - whenever we hit one of the whenever we
14:47 - select one room that we want to join
14:48 - this this here is cold and we can see
14:51 - that we join the match we tell the
14:54 - network manager dot match maker to join
14:56 - the match then we clear the room list
14:58 - and we set status text equal to joining
15:00 - so let's expand upon this a bit and in
15:03 - order to give ourselves some more
15:05 - control with waiting and stuff like that
15:08 - let's also go up here and use our import
15:12 - system dot collections so this allows us
15:15 - to use an ienumerator
15:16 - so let's do that so let's create an
15:19 - enumerator here and let's call this on
15:22 - wait for join
15:25 - and in here we can clear the room list
15:29 - and we can set the status text and we
15:32 - can also make sure to call it here's
15:34 - let's say start co-routine wait for join
15:37 - whoops wait for join there we go and
15:42 - basically I want to go in here and say
15:44 - wow and we want to do this using an
15:48 - integer so let's have an integer with
15:51 - the countdown and we'll let the Ryan
15:54 - alpha testing will set this to five but
15:56 - I definitely recommend that you go at
15:59 - least 10 seconds and my experience is
16:01 - that at least for joining on the same
16:03 - network unit normally waits at least 5
16:06 - seconds before joining that is a bit of
16:09 - time but that just means that you have
16:12 - to adjust for it inside of this variable
16:14 - so if you set it to 5 it is going to say
16:17 - failed and then join and that's going to
16:19 - be weird so instead just put at least 10
16:22 - seconds in here is what I recommend so
16:26 - we'll have this countdown that starts
16:28 - off at 5 and we'll say that we want to
16:30 - continue trying to join while the
16:33 - countdown is greater than zero so when
16:36 - we haven't reached zero we want to keep
16:38 - on counting and status that text here
16:41 - let's move that into the wall and then
16:43 - what we can do here is we can add a bit
16:45 - of code so we can say joining and then
16:47 - we can input the countdown variable so
16:50 - we'll just put a an open parenthesis
16:54 - we'll have the countdown and then we'll
16:56 - have a closed parenthesis and and that
17:00 - is going to look just fine and then
17:02 - we'll have to of course subtract the
17:04 - count down here so minus minus so that
17:07 - we will subtract by one and we'll also
17:10 - have to wait a bit in here so let's put
17:13 - in a yield return new wait for seconds
17:16 - and we'll just wait one second exactly
17:20 - so to explain what's going on here we
17:22 - call join match we start this enumerator
17:24 - we clear the room list we set and we
17:28 - create an integer variable that starts
17:30 - at 5 then we say while this countdown
17:34 - variable hasn't reached zero we want to
17:36 - display the countdown
17:39 - and tell the user that we're currently
17:41 - trying to join and then we want to wait
17:44 - a second and then we want to subtract
17:46 - one and then we want to go back here so
17:48 - then display again wait a second
17:50 - subtract by one until we reach zero at
17:53 - which point if we haven't connected we
17:55 - failed and if we have well then we don't
17:58 - reach this part of the code then we have
18:00 - transitioned to a new scene so that is
18:02 - not something we have to account for so
18:04 - if we get reach this place down here we
18:07 - actually failed to connect and we can
18:10 - show this in multiple ways one way is to
18:13 - just go status dot text equals and then
18:18 - failed to connect and let's just make
18:24 - sure that we display this for a little
18:26 - while so that the user will be able to
18:28 - notice what is going on so let's just
18:30 - wait one second after that and then we
18:32 - can refresh our room list there we go
18:38 - so this should actually work just fine
18:41 - and my cat demands some attention so I
18:43 - would be right back
18:45 - look here he was kind of getting mad
18:47 - because he couldn't jump on the table by
18:49 - himself so now he's up here I might jump
18:52 - on the keyboard at some point but we'll
18:54 - continue the video so we should actually
18:56 - be able to test this inside of unity now
18:58 - so if we go back into unity and hit play
19:00 - and try and host a new game here so
19:03 - let's just call the room test hit create
19:05 - room and let's leave that room and then
19:08 - let's try and rejoin which shouldn't be
19:10 - able to happen so we can see it says
19:13 - joining five four three two one and then
19:16 - it should say fail to connect and it's
19:18 - going to refresh that list however it
19:22 - might say failed to connect and refresh
19:24 - the list but the request that we sent
19:27 - for joining the match might still be
19:29 - running in the background now it's not
19:31 - specified by unity exactly how they
19:33 - handle these requests but it might still
19:36 - be running and you can see there it
19:37 - dropped the connection on its own right
19:40 - to the room and you can see that
19:42 - actually also comes with an error so
19:44 - what we'll do here is we'll make sure to
19:46 - drop the connection and we'll make sure
19:48 - to check if our matchmaker is running to
19:52 - get rid of
19:52 - weird behavior so um in order to do this
19:56 - let's use the code inspired by our past
19:58 - menu for leaving the room so we'll just
20:01 - take this here and copy it inside of our
20:04 - drawing game right before we refresh our
20:07 - room list here so if we fail to connect
20:09 - we want to get some matching flow from
20:11 - the UH network manager and we want to
20:14 - input an if statement here is saying if
20:16 - match info is not equal to null because
20:19 - this might actually be equal to null and
20:21 - if it is we don't want any weird
20:23 - behavior and if it's not equal to null
20:26 - meaning that we do have some match info
20:28 - we want to drop the connection to that
20:30 - using matching photon network ID
20:33 - matching for node ID and then calling
20:35 - network manager dot on drug connection
20:37 - and then we also want to make sure to
20:39 - stop the host so um let's just save that
20:43 - code and that should work just fine
20:44 - however one thing that we still need to
20:47 - do is get rid of this weird behavior
20:49 - here when refreshing the room list so up
20:52 - by where we refresh room list here we
20:57 - clear the room list and then we go on to
21:00 - list the matches but what we really want
21:03 - to do is we want to make sure that if
21:05 - network manager done matchmaker is equal
21:10 - to null then we want to start the
21:14 - matchmaker so the matchmaker might have
21:16 - been terminated at this point and we
21:18 - need to make sure to restart it in case
21:21 - that happens so start matchmaker
21:23 - and there we go so that should actually
21:26 - take care of all of this for us and you
21:28 - can see it's basically the same code as
21:29 - we wrote up here and now everything
21:32 - should run smoothly so we can maybe set
21:35 - this count out to ten instead so that
21:37 - everything works properly and let's now
21:40 - try and build this out and see if we are
21:43 - totally error-free on both clients so
21:45 - let's build the player here and I think
21:49 - this will work I'm pretty sure this will
21:53 - work and let's try to play on the unity
21:57 - editor here create a test room and that
22:00 - is working that's now of course we have
22:03 - to login on our client here so let's
22:05 - just log in with
22:06 - test123 it log in there and we should
22:09 - transition over to the lobby we can join
22:11 - this game just fine and you can see it's
22:13 - attempts to join here and it says six
22:15 - five and then it should join there we go
22:18 - and we can disconnect from this and we
22:21 - can rejoin if we want to or let's say
22:23 - that we try and leave this room and then
22:26 - try and reconnect here so let's try and
22:28 - reconnect on these two you can see it's
22:29 - still there so we can still attempt to
22:31 - connect but um it's not going to happen
22:34 - and it's going to reach zero here and
22:37 - it's going to say failed to connect and
22:39 - it's going to refresh the list and you
22:41 - can see that the game is still there but
22:43 - it will be cleaned up in a second and if
22:46 - we keep on doing this for about thirty
22:48 - seconds we should see at last that the
22:51 - game disappears but it might just take a
22:53 - little while so it says fail to connect
22:56 - again here and you can see at the moment
22:58 - now if we had refresh it says no roams
23:00 - at the moment because the room has now
23:02 - been cleaned up so that is a much much
23:05 - cleaner way of doing things we cannot
23:07 - help unity clean up these rooms but we
23:09 - can at least make sure that people don't
23:11 - get stuck trying to connect to a room
23:13 - that isn't there so that's basically all
23:16 - I wanted to show for this video I hope
23:18 - you enjoyed it and I will see you in the
23:20 - next video thank you so much to all of
23:22 - the awesome patreon supporters who
23:24 - donated in August and the special thanks
23:26 - to our own Metta Robert Roach

Cleaned transcript:

this video is brought to you by our own Metta thank you so much for donating if you want to support breakage yourself you can go to patreon.com/scishow cheese thanks for tuning in at brac ease hello everyone and welcome to this video and creating a multiplayer fears in unity today we will do a bunch of different stuff so we'll be fixing some box we'll get rid of some warnings we'll be adding a cursor lock to the game so when we're not in some kind of menu and we're in actually playing we will get rid of the cursor and censored in the middle of the screen so it won't get in the way and we'll also be adding a joint room timeout so if you try to join a room but for some reason you aren't successful it will just count down from X amount of setting seconds and when it reaches zero it will just stop and say failed and you can try and join another one so yeah some exciting stuff also will mention that since the last video I have created a the first video in game theory which is patreon funded because we reached level two and I think it turned out really well this one is on vectors so if you're interested in that you can click the link now and without further ado let's jump right into it so you can see that I'm community and the first thing that I want to get rid of it's just all of these annoying warnings that are there as soon as we put up our projects and these are because of the crossplatform input initialized script that is part of the standard assets that we've imported so let's just double click that and basically in Visual Studio and this is super nice it underlines all of the all of the parts that we can just go ahead and get rid of so everything with these Green Wave's under them we're just going to remove that we can get rid of this one and these one and basically this doesn't really matter but if you want to get rid of the warnings this is the way to go it's because some of these like the vp8 and blackberry are obsolete so let's just save that and you can see that that should clear out our console so that's really nice and another warning that I want to get rid of is when we go in here and create a game here and he created room you can see it says the reference script and this behavior is missing and that is just because if we go to our and find our prefabs and then the I believe it's the fire it's much it might not be under our prefab so let's just doubleclick this and it should select it so this is also under standard assets we should just go ahead and remove this empty script right there and I believe that that should fix both of them so now when we clear out the console here hit play and try and create another room here you can see that we have serial warning so that is perfect so the next thing that I wanted to do and I've actually gone ahead and compiled a little list here of things that I wanted to do so that was the warnings it's fix the host game disconnect buck and that basically means that if we try and hit play here and we want to create a room room and we hit create room and we then leave this room and try to host a new one test create room you can see nothing is happening here and the reason why is that we have now lost the connection from our modules host game create room button here you can see that the on click event here doesn't have any connection to any object and the reason why is that the functionality for that sits on our network manager and our network manager is transferred on to the next scene and so when we go back here it has lost that connection so what we will do instead is we'll just copy this host game component and remove it from the network manager and create an empty game object that will just reset the transform on and whoops if I can stop dragging out the lighting there and we will call this one host game and we can then just paste that component back in as new just the way that we did it with our join game and you can of course make those on the same object but I'll just go ahead and separate them out into two different ones and then under our canvas modules host game create room button we can now drag host game under that on click event go under host game and here create room and we'll have to do the same with the room name input so you can see there's also an on value changed here dragon host game go host game and then let's select the set room name as a dynamic string so we will pass in whatever is in the input field so that should indeed get rid of that bug there so now if we try and create a first room hit create room and we leave that room and try and create a second room here you can see that that now just simply works except it took a bit of time there but it actually works so that's fine cool so the next thing that I wanted to go ahead and do is fix the spawn bug and I'm actually going to add another thing here and that is the spawn menu continue button I think we should have one of those so now let's begin by fixing this spawn bug and what I'm talking about here will become very much more apparent if we go and find our main menu and we have the nice level here and we take find our spawn points here so focus in on those you can see that we have one on the ground here we have one another one on the ground here and then we have one on top of these platforms and it is when we spawn on top of these platforms that this bug becomes very apparent so let's just try and disable all of the other spawn points except that except for the third one here and let's see what happens if we now go back into our lobby and try and create a game let's try and create a test room here and you can see that we spawn on top of this but you can see that currently we are flying a lot higher above the ground that we normally would so we have this weird kind of offset position and the reason why is actually really simple it is that if we find our player and find our configurable joint component you can see that we have currently set it to auto configure connected anger and that means that the kind of the anger point from where we do all of our configure will join our calculations will be set depending on where I respond so if we spawn at a higher point it will be set higher and that is not something we want we want this to be fixed so we'll just remove that all right uncheck that and then we'll have the connected anger be zero one zero so that we will be anchored at one unit above the surface so if we now try and hit play here and this should actually work so let's just create a room here and you can see that we're now standing on the platform correctly and we jump down and everything seems to be working cool so that got rid of that bug and that was all for that cool so now we can go ahead and add a spawn menu into our or that is not correct I wanted to say add pause menu continue there we go so right now when we are in our game here if we go under our main level and we need to reenable all of our spawn points here and we drag in our prefab player UI and we enable our past menu and let's shift to 2d mode and hit F to focus in on this you can see that we only have one button which is the lead room I basically want to add just another button that very simply continues the game instead of leaving so that we don't have to use the Escape key in case the user I don't know forgets or accidentally opens the boss menu and yeah it's just a cleaner way to do UI to have a button there as well so the first thing I want to do here is just bump down the redness of this button I think it's a bit too much something like that looks better and now let's duplicate this and we can rename this one to continue button and we can take this and drag it up to be right above and we can change the color here to something darker like a dark gray and let's go ahead and change the text as well here to continue we can select both buttons and we can maybe drag them down to center them and then we can take our continue button move it up here and let's now change this on click event so under our past menu is where we currently call a function called Lee room but we don't have a function in here for toggling the spawn menu or post menu I keep doing that on and off that's actually sits under I'll play a UI script so under I'll play UI you can see we have a toggle pass menu and all we really need to do is make this public for us to be able to go to a continue button and access it from there so if we're now dragging our player UI and going to play a UI and then whoops not send match message upwards I want to go toggle pause menu and it should actually be that symbol so if we now hit apply on this and remove the player UI again and hit and we cannot hit play directly we have to go through the lobby here so let's find a lobby here hit play and let's create a test room and when we now and we just have to wait for it to actually join here okay so okay I forgot to disable the post menu here so let's say find our player UI let's find our pass menu and we'll just have that disabled by default so let's hit play again here and try that out so create a room and when we go into the past menu now you can see that we can continue or leave the room and if we decide to continue we just jump right back into the game however you can see multiple problems with this at the moment one is that we are able if we open the past menu while holding down a key we'll keep moving that in that direction and also the same with the mouse so if I drag around here and over the past menu you can see that we don't lose that momentum so let's fix that along with adding in a cursor lock which was also the next point here cool so in order to do this what I want to bring up is our player and find the player controller so in Hue undo our update method we have a check to see if the past menu is currently on what I want to do is right below this that means whenever we aren't past I want to check to see if our cursor is locked and if it is not then we should go ahead and lock it right away so I'm going to go if and then we can go cursor dot a lock state and if that is not equal to cursor lock mode dot locked and you can see we have three options here we have confined which means that well the curse is confined to the game and window but it can move anywhere inside the game window we have locked which basically just sets it to the center of the game we know and we have none which means that it can move as it wants to so if it's not locked then we want to say cursor dot lock state equals cursor mode or cursor lock mode locked there we go and if we are past so if past menu dot is on well then we can go ahead and disable that so let's we still want to return from all of this but right before we return we can say if cursor lock mode or cursor dot lock state is not equal to cursor lock mode none well then we want to set cursor dot lock state equal to cursor lock mode dot none there we go so and of course this check is somewhat unnecessary you could just go ahead and set it but it's just a bit cleaner not setting it every single frame but one thing that we will have to set every single frame is motored odd move is what we can then say and then we can pass in vector 3.0 and that just means that we will stay in place and we'll do the same with motor rotate vector 3.0 and remember we also had a separate function for rotating the camera up and down so we'll have a motor rotate camera and that only takes in a float which is going to be serum so this will allow us to stay in place so if we now try and hit play here and join a room and test room you can see our cursor immediately disappears so that's perfect if I escape here it comes back and you can see that that just works and also if we try and move our camera here you can see that immediate stops when we hit the passkey and if we try and move it the same thing happens so that is perfect and that is working cool so I believe that was all we wanted to do with the cursor the last thing that I wanted to add in this video is a joint game timer because currently we are using the matchmaking system that unity gives us the Unity matchmaker and that's working fine however one annoying thing is that when you try and when you create a room and you the host then leaves making that room not joinable and you then try to reconnect or other clients try to reconnect just after the host leaves the room won't be cleaned up so it will still appear under the join room list here but it's not actually joinable and it won't cost any errors but it will just say joining joining joining pretty much forever until you hit the refresh button and I think that is bad UI so instead we should tell the user what is going on by having some kind of countdown and when it reaches 0 will say failed and then we'll return to everything to normal so the way to do this is by going on to our joint game script and double click that and we will find the function down here called join room and this is basically called whenever we hit one of the whenever we select one room that we want to join this this here is cold and we can see that we join the match we tell the network manager dot match maker to join the match then we clear the room list and we set status text equal to joining so let's expand upon this a bit and in order to give ourselves some more control with waiting and stuff like that let's also go up here and use our import system dot collections so this allows us to use an ienumerator so let's do that so let's create an enumerator here and let's call this on wait for join and in here we can clear the room list and we can set the status text and we can also make sure to call it here's let's say start coroutine wait for join whoops wait for join there we go and basically I want to go in here and say wow and we want to do this using an integer so let's have an integer with the countdown and we'll let the Ryan alpha testing will set this to five but I definitely recommend that you go at least 10 seconds and my experience is that at least for joining on the same network unit normally waits at least 5 seconds before joining that is a bit of time but that just means that you have to adjust for it inside of this variable so if you set it to 5 it is going to say failed and then join and that's going to be weird so instead just put at least 10 seconds in here is what I recommend so we'll have this countdown that starts off at 5 and we'll say that we want to continue trying to join while the countdown is greater than zero so when we haven't reached zero we want to keep on counting and status that text here let's move that into the wall and then what we can do here is we can add a bit of code so we can say joining and then we can input the countdown variable so we'll just put a an open parenthesis we'll have the countdown and then we'll have a closed parenthesis and and that is going to look just fine and then we'll have to of course subtract the count down here so minus minus so that we will subtract by one and we'll also have to wait a bit in here so let's put in a yield return new wait for seconds and we'll just wait one second exactly so to explain what's going on here we call join match we start this enumerator we clear the room list we set and we create an integer variable that starts at 5 then we say while this countdown variable hasn't reached zero we want to display the countdown and tell the user that we're currently trying to join and then we want to wait a second and then we want to subtract one and then we want to go back here so then display again wait a second subtract by one until we reach zero at which point if we haven't connected we failed and if we have well then we don't reach this part of the code then we have transitioned to a new scene so that is not something we have to account for so if we get reach this place down here we actually failed to connect and we can show this in multiple ways one way is to just go status dot text equals and then failed to connect and let's just make sure that we display this for a little while so that the user will be able to notice what is going on so let's just wait one second after that and then we can refresh our room list there we go so this should actually work just fine and my cat demands some attention so I would be right back look here he was kind of getting mad because he couldn't jump on the table by himself so now he's up here I might jump on the keyboard at some point but we'll continue the video so we should actually be able to test this inside of unity now so if we go back into unity and hit play and try and host a new game here so let's just call the room test hit create room and let's leave that room and then let's try and rejoin which shouldn't be able to happen so we can see it says joining five four three two one and then it should say fail to connect and it's going to refresh that list however it might say failed to connect and refresh the list but the request that we sent for joining the match might still be running in the background now it's not specified by unity exactly how they handle these requests but it might still be running and you can see there it dropped the connection on its own right to the room and you can see that actually also comes with an error so what we'll do here is we'll make sure to drop the connection and we'll make sure to check if our matchmaker is running to get rid of weird behavior so um in order to do this let's use the code inspired by our past menu for leaving the room so we'll just take this here and copy it inside of our drawing game right before we refresh our room list here so if we fail to connect we want to get some matching flow from the UH network manager and we want to input an if statement here is saying if match info is not equal to null because this might actually be equal to null and if it is we don't want any weird behavior and if it's not equal to null meaning that we do have some match info we want to drop the connection to that using matching photon network ID matching for node ID and then calling network manager dot on drug connection and then we also want to make sure to stop the host so um let's just save that code and that should work just fine however one thing that we still need to do is get rid of this weird behavior here when refreshing the room list so up by where we refresh room list here we clear the room list and then we go on to list the matches but what we really want to do is we want to make sure that if network manager done matchmaker is equal to null then we want to start the matchmaker so the matchmaker might have been terminated at this point and we need to make sure to restart it in case that happens so start matchmaker and there we go so that should actually take care of all of this for us and you can see it's basically the same code as we wrote up here and now everything should run smoothly so we can maybe set this count out to ten instead so that everything works properly and let's now try and build this out and see if we are totally errorfree on both clients so let's build the player here and I think this will work I'm pretty sure this will work and let's try to play on the unity editor here create a test room and that is working that's now of course we have to login on our client here so let's just log in with test123 it log in there and we should transition over to the lobby we can join this game just fine and you can see it's attempts to join here and it says six five and then it should join there we go and we can disconnect from this and we can rejoin if we want to or let's say that we try and leave this room and then try and reconnect here so let's try and reconnect on these two you can see it's still there so we can still attempt to connect but um it's not going to happen and it's going to reach zero here and it's going to say failed to connect and it's going to refresh the list and you can see that the game is still there but it will be cleaned up in a second and if we keep on doing this for about thirty seconds we should see at last that the game disappears but it might just take a little while so it says fail to connect again here and you can see at the moment now if we had refresh it says no roams at the moment because the room has now been cleaned up so that is a much much cleaner way of doing things we cannot help unity clean up these rooms but we can at least make sure that people don't get stuck trying to connect to a room that isn't there so that's basically all I wanted to show for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video thank you so much to all of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in August and the special thanks to our own Metta Robert Roach James Calhoun vixen P and Andrew Kate
