With timestamps:

00:00 - so I've been using unity for about six
00:02 - years now and I've only recently started
00:04 - to make good use of some of the editing
00:05 - extensions on the asset store a man do I
00:08 - feel dumb these assets have already
00:10 - saved me so much time and I honestly
00:12 - don't know why it took me so long to
00:14 - start using them so I've made a list of
00:16 - my favorite editing extensions to help
00:17 - you guys avoid making the same mistake
00:19 - the first asset on the list is editor
00:21 - console Pro in the console Pro is a
00:23 - powerful replacement for the standard
00:25 - console window you can group together
00:27 - messages you can assign colors and icons
00:29 - and even preview the source code
00:31 - surrounding each method call in the
00:33 - stack but most importantly you can now
00:35 - search for entries and hide the ones
00:37 - that you don't want to see finally no
00:39 - more going through scripts to comment
00:41 - out debug box a the console Pro is paid
00:43 - but in my opinion it is super worth it
00:45 - next it's a free asset called do tween
00:47 - I've tried a few different tweening
00:48 - engines from the store but I definitely
00:50 - think two tween is the most easy and
00:52 - stable do tween allows you to easily add
00:54 - cool animations to your game objects and
00:57 - UI elements I must use it to spice up my
00:59 - UI with some fancy animation deuteron
01:01 - also has a pro version which adds a
01:03 - visual path and animation editor a 3rd
01:06 - asset is for those of you who aren't too
01:08 - excited about programming in c-sharp
01:10 - luckily for you playmaker is a powerful
01:12 - visual scripting solution it allows
01:14 - artists designers and also programmers
01:17 - to create advanced logic within a
01:19 - node-based editor this asset is paid but
01:21 - if you're looking for a way to make
01:22 - games without writing code playmaker is
01:24 - really great now a common issue when
01:26 - making games for mobile is setting up
01:28 - some good on-screen controls CN controls
01:31 - is a free asset that helps you do
01:33 - exactly that the package contains a
01:35 - bunch of different controls from
01:36 - joystick to d-pad and it allows you to
01:39 - customize the controls to suit the look
01:40 - of your game and the best part is it's
01:42 - free and now the final asset on the list
01:44 - the amplifi shader editor this asset
01:47 - allows you to create shaders using a
01:48 - visual node editor some of the coolest
01:50 - effects I've seen this year have been
01:52 - made using this asset it's easy to use
01:54 - and it comes with a bunch of examples to
01:56 - help you get started it is paid on the
01:58 - story but if you're serious about
01:59 - graphics I definitely recommend picking
02:01 - this up and that's pretty much my list
02:03 - of top editor extensions I've created a
02:05 - list on the asset store which contains
02:06 - all them as well as a few ones that I
02:08 - could squeeze into the video one of them
02:10 - is final I K which definitely deserves a
02:12 - mention so
02:13 - in the description to check them out now
02:15 - there are a few great assets that I
02:16 - haven't included like CRO builder text
02:18 - mesh and Odin but that's because I've
02:20 - already mentioned them in my list of
