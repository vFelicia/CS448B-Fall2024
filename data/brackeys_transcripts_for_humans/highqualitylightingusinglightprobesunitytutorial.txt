00:00 - - One of the most powerful features
00:01 - in Unity is the ability
to bake your lighting data
00:04 - into light maps.
00:05 - - [Announcer] Bake light's at
4,000 Kelvin for 30 minutes
00:07 - for a crisp surface and a juicy core.
00:10 - - Hmm, not only does this make your game
00:12 - a lot more performant,
00:14 - but it also makes the
lighting much more detailed
00:16 - and realistic and apparently delicious.
00:18 - But of course, the problem
with baked lighting
00:20 - is that not all objects
in your scene are static.
00:23 - Sometimes you want objects
such as your player
00:26 - to move around but still react
00:27 - to the different lighting
conditions in your scene.
00:29 - Luckily, Unity has a solution
for this, light probes.
00:33 - With light probes, you
can get all the benefits
00:35 - of baked lighting on the static
objects while making sure
00:37 - that moving objects
stay appropriately lit.
00:40 - In fact, when you create a new project,
00:42 - the Unity sample scene already
00:43 - has a bunch of light probe set up.
00:45 - So it's something I
really recommend you use,
00:47 - and it's actually insanely easy to set up.
00:49 - But before I show you
how to do exactly that,
00:51 - Unity is currently giving away free eBooks
00:53 - on improving your game
development workflow.
00:55 - The eBook is called
00:56 - "Nine Ways to Optimise
Your Game Development"
00:58 - and it's filled to the brim
with cool and very useful tips,
01:01 - tricks, and good practises
to help you finish
01:03 - your game faster and avoid
headaches along the way.
01:06 - Although I think it's
a really cool checklist
01:08 - for people making a game.
01:10 - I've been using Unity
for over 10 years now
01:12 - and I still found plenty of
cool stuff in there on topics
01:14 - like physics, performance,
UI, and the list goes on
01:18 - Again, it's completely free
01:19 - and I don't know how long
this offer will be up.
01:21 - So make sure to get it while
it's available by simply
01:24 - clicking the link in the description
01:25 - and filling out the form.
01:26 - It literally takes just 10 seconds.
01:28 - It's a really solid addition
to your game dev library
01:31 - so make sure to check it
out even just for later use.
01:34 - Now, before we start adding
light probes to our scene,
01:37 - let's have a look at how they work.
01:38 - Well, when you bake your lighting,
01:40 - Unity does its best to
simulate real light rays
01:42 - bouncing around the scene.
01:44 - It will then take this
lighting data and turn it
01:46 - into large textures that are then overlaid
01:48 - on top of your objects.
01:50 - What light probes do is allow
us to add certain points
01:53 - around our scene that will
store the lighting information
01:55 - in that particular place.
01:57 - For example, if we add a light probe
01:58 - to a place in the shadow,
02:00 - the probe knows that at this
point, the lighting is darker.
02:04 - Or if we add a light probe
close to a coloured surface,
02:07 - the probe knows that at this
point there is coloured light
02:10 - bouncing off of that surface.
02:11 - Then when we add in a moving object,
02:14 - that object will automatically
check what light probes
02:16 - are nearby and light itself
02:18 - based on the information in those probes.
02:20 - And not only that, it will
also smooth the transition
02:22 - from one probe to another.
02:24 - Now, how do we go about
doing this in Unity?
02:27 - Well, let's find out.
02:28 - So as you can see,
02:29 - I've set up this quick
assemble scene in Unity.
02:31 - And all I have in here are two white cubes
02:33 - making up our walls.
02:35 - I have two cubes making up a floor,
02:37 - one is red and one is blue.
02:39 - And finally I have this fear here,
02:41 - which is going to represent
our moving object.
02:44 - So you could imagine this
being a player for example.
02:47 - And of course I have a directional light
02:49 - lighting the entire scene.
02:51 - So let's first of all get
our scene ready for baking.
02:54 - To do that, we want to
select all the objects
02:56 - that are static in our scene
02:58 - and go to the right
corner of the inspector
03:00 - and mark them as static.
03:02 - I'm going to hit yes, change children
03:03 - to change all these selected
objects and right away,
03:06 - you will see that Unity
starts baking a light map.
03:09 - I'm also going to go to
our directional light here
03:11 - and mark that as static as well.
03:14 - And under the light settings
here, there is a mode
03:17 - and I'm going to change
that from real time to mixed
03:20 - because we want to use a mix between baked
03:23 - and real time lighting.
03:24 - This way, our light will bake in
03:26 - all of the lighting information
on all the static objects
03:28 - and still have our real
time objects cast shadows
03:31 - as you see here.
03:33 - If for some reason your
scene isn't baking right
03:35 - or you just want to play around
03:36 - with some of the light mapping settings,
03:38 - you can always go window, rendering
03:40 - and open up the lighting settings.
03:42 - Here there are of course
a bunch of settings
03:44 - for configuring your light
mapper and at the bottom,
03:47 - you can control whether or not
03:48 - you want to automatically
generate light maps
03:50 - or do so manually.
03:52 - I'm just going to set those to auto.
03:54 - Of course, to learn more
about begging your lighting,
03:56 - check out our video on
symbol lighting in Unity.
03:58 - There's a lot more info there.
04:00 - So now that our lighting is baked,
04:02 - we can see that we already have
04:04 - some more detailed lighting in here.
04:05 - We have some ambient
occlusion and we even have
04:08 - some bounced lighting where
you can see some of the colour
04:10 - of nearby surfaces spilling
onto the white walls here.
04:14 - However this doesn't apply to our sphere.
04:17 - This is not marked as static,
04:19 - and so when we start to move this around,
04:21 - we can see that there's no
bounce lighting being applied.
04:24 - And if we move it into the shadow,
04:26 - well, it stays completely lit.
04:28 - In other words, we need to add
light probes to this scene.
04:32 - So to do that, let's go to our hierarchy,
04:34 - let's hit the plus sign,
04:35 - let's go under light and
select light probe group.
04:39 - And right away you can
see this adds a group
04:41 - of light probes into our scene.
04:43 - Let's move this up to make sure that
04:45 - all of our light probes
are above our ground.
04:48 - And what we can now do
is start to distribute
04:50 - these probes around our scene.
04:52 - So I'm going to hit edit
light probes over here.
04:55 - And with that selected,
04:56 - we can now select each
one of these light probes.
04:59 - We can also select the multiple at once
05:02 - and actually start moving these around.
05:05 - So I'm going to start
by placing a light probe
05:07 - in each corner of our
scene here, there we go.
05:10 - And I'm going to take all
of the top light probes
05:13 - and move them up to the
top of our scene as well.
05:16 - So now we've created this
big cube of a light probes.
05:20 - However, this is currently
not very detailed.
05:23 - What we really want to do is go ahead
05:24 - and add additional light probes
05:26 - to wherever there's a change
in the conditions of our scene.
05:31 - A good example of this is
this colour change right here.
05:34 - Now this is going to
influence the bounce lighting
05:36 - that is going to spill onto our sphere.
05:38 - So we probably want to add a light probe
05:40 - on either side of this change.
05:43 - So if we go from the right here,
05:44 - we will have some red light
and that will slowly transition
05:48 - as we moved to the left to blue light.
05:50 - So to do that, let's go
ahead and simply select
05:53 - some of these light probes here.
05:54 - Let's hit control D to
duplicate and move them over.
05:57 - You can also use the buttons out here
05:59 - and I'm going to put one
to the left of this change,
06:02 - hit control D again and put one
to the right of this change.
06:06 - Similarly, we want to do
the same thing with shadows.
06:09 - So if we go over here, we
can see there's a change
06:12 - between fully lit and shadow.
06:15 - So let's go in here
and let's select all of
06:17 - these light probes here,
let's hit control D
06:20 - and let's move them over to
one side of the shadow here.
06:23 - And the other side of the shadow here.
06:26 - And for these here, we
could actually go ahead
06:28 - and select only these
light probes right here,
06:32 - and we could move them over
06:34 - and maybe just take a couple of them here
06:36 - and move those over here,
06:38 - just to kind of follow the
direction of our shadow.
06:41 - So with that, we've actually gone ahead
06:43 - and covered most of the changes
06:44 - in lighting conditions
throughout our scene.
06:47 - We can definitely go in
and fine tune some of this.
06:49 - And one thing that you
definitely want to be aware of
06:52 - is that you don't place
any of these probes
06:54 - inside of all the objects.
06:55 - That will definitely cause
very weird behaviours.
06:58 - So don't go inside of the cube
07:00 - because then it will be
completely dark for these probes.
07:03 - Just leave them right outside
of all of these things.
07:06 - And if you now stop
editing these light probes,
07:08 - it should just work automatically.
07:10 - If we now select our sphere,
07:12 - because this is not marked as static,
07:14 - it's automatically going to show
07:15 - which light probes are nearby.
07:17 - And as we start moving it
around, we can see it changing
07:20 - between the different
light probes available,
07:22 - really, really cool.
07:23 - In fact, we can see the lighting
change on a sphere already.
07:27 - Right now, it's actually
receiving some red bounce light
07:30 - from the surface, but as
we go and move over here,
07:32 - we can see that bounce light
changing to a more blue colour.
07:36 - And if we move it into the shadow here,
07:39 - we can see transition
to a much, much darker
07:41 - lighting edition because we are now inside
07:43 - of the shadow, really cool.
07:45 - And all this again, just
happens automatically.
07:48 - In fact, something really cool
07:49 - that you might not have noticed is that
07:51 - each one of these probes
here actually display
07:54 - the lighting conditions on a tiny sphere.
07:57 - So you can see what's going on
07:58 - with these probes inside of the editor.
08:00 - Take, for example, these two right here,
08:02 - we can actually see the red
light bouncing onto one of them
08:06 - and the blue light bouncing onto another.
08:09 - And all we're doing here is just moving
08:10 - from one of these probes to
another, really, really cool.
08:14 - And this should actually work
right away in game as well.
08:17 - However, sometimes I've
noticed that Unity light maps
08:20 - can be a bit weird when playing a scene,
08:23 - especially when transitioning
from one scene to another.
08:26 - So if this is causing
weird behaviour for you
08:28 - or the light probes simply
aren't working in game,
08:31 - I recommend disabling auto-generate
08:33 - and then manually generating the lighting
08:35 - by hitting this button.
08:36 - For me, this has always
solved a bunch of issues
08:38 - and if we now select our sphere,
08:40 - I've gone ahead and added
a quick move script to it.
08:43 - So if we now hit play, we
can see that the lining here
08:45 - is indeed working inside
of the game as well,
08:49 - just as intended, awesome.
08:51 - And of course you can go
completely nuts with this
08:53 - and add as many real objects as you want.
08:56 - We could go in here and
quickly create a cube as well.
09:00 - Let's move it up here and
place it, let's say here,
09:03 - and it's just add a white material to it.
09:05 - And right away you can see that
09:07 - this is also being influenced
by all of our probes.
09:10 - So it's that easy to now
start adding new objects.
09:14 - You only have to do this set up once.
09:16 - Woo hoo, and that's pretty
much it for this video.
09:18 - This is a really quick effect,
09:20 - but it's just so incredibly useful.
09:22 - And a lot of people get scared
to use it because they see
09:24 - a bunch of light probes around the scene
09:26 - and think it's way more
complicated than it really is.
09:29 - So we thought we just
had to make a video on it
09:31 - to show that it's really not that hard.
09:32 - And if you enjoyed this video,

One of the most powerful features in Unity is the ability to bake your lighting data into light maps. [Announcer] Bake light's at 4,000 Kelvin for 30 minutes for a crisp surface and a juicy core.
