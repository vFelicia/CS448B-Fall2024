00:00 - hello on the reason I did a top 10 unity
00:02 - tricks video which you can check out
00:03 - here a lot of you guys asked which
00:05 - settings I use for unity and Visual
00:07 - Studio I like to configure my workspace
00:08 - to get the most out of it and I hope you
00:10 - will find these features as useful as I
00:12 - do keep in mind only use some of these
00:14 - settings on tutorials because I want
00:15 - people to be able to follow along so
00:17 - here are my settings
00:18 - 2017 let's begin with the unity UI
00:20 - here's what it looks like by default
00:21 - first off I like to take my project
00:24 - panel and switch to a one column layout
00:26 - I don't like to drag it over here by the
00:28 - hierarchy and also drag the console so
00:30 - that it aligns with the scene you like
00:32 - to make this pretty small and most of
00:34 - the time I'll take my game view and dock
00:35 - it side by side with the scene view so I
00:38 - can see both at the same time also like
00:40 - to make my inspector fairly big and
00:41 - always remove the asset store I think
00:43 - it's much easier to use in the web
00:45 - browser then I normally go window and
00:47 - find the animator I like to either have
00:49 - this on my secondary monitor or if
00:51 - that's not available to me I'll just
00:53 - target by the game view and the
00:54 - animation window
00:55 - I'll have sit down here by the console
00:58 - so pretty simple not much to it but I
00:59 - really like it this way I will also
01:01 - always go to edit project settings and
01:03 - then quality and make sure these
01:05 - settings are set pretty high this just
01:07 - allows you to view your game at maximum
01:09 - quality instead of having unity do
01:10 - texture compression or turn off certain
01:13 - lights let's just go in here and change
01:15 - the pixel light count to 20 keep the
01:17 - texture settings and then pop up empty
01:18 - aliasing to at least 4 sometimes I'll
01:21 - even go to the shadow resolution and set
01:22 - that to very high of course you should
01:24 - always go back and configure the
01:25 - different levels to suit your game but
01:27 - when viewing it in the editor it's a
01:29 - good idea to have maximum quality then
01:31 - always go to edit preferences if there's
01:33 - a particular project that I'm often
01:34 - working on I'm just going to check off
01:36 - the load previous project on startup but
01:38 - of course I've been doing a lot of
01:39 - tutorials and so I'm not going to click
01:41 - that one under external tools I'll
01:42 - always select visual studio 2015 over in
01:45 - monodevelop I just really prefer that I
01:47 - also like to go to colors and just give
01:50 - it a bit of play mode tint so then I'm
01:51 - always notified when I'm in play mode in
01:53 - the editor
01:54 - finally I go to edit project settings
01:56 - and then choose editor and in here
01:59 - always make sure my version control is
02:01 - set to visible metafiles that's because
02:03 - I normally use github as source control
02:05 - and having visible metafiles makes it a
02:07 - lot easier to see what's going on
02:08 - I would also set the acid civilization
02:11 - to force text by default it's going to
02:13 - be on make
02:13 - but first Texas just so much nicer when
02:15 - using github so if we now go and create
02:17 - a new script I just call this one test
02:19 - script you can see that it generates
02:21 - this default template I don't like this
02:23 - default template thankfully unity action
02:25 - that has a way to customize this all I
02:27 - need to do is go to the path on the
02:28 - screen now it's going to depend on your
02:30 - operating system so once you get to that
02:31 - path it's going to look something like
02:33 - this if you're using c-sharp the file
02:34 - you want to edit is the c-sharp script
02:36 - new behavior script C is text so double
02:39 - click on that and you can simply change
02:41 - this to whatever you want I like to
02:42 - delete the two using tags except for the
02:44 - using unity engine also like to remove
02:46 - the comments put the curly brackets here
02:49 - on new lines and I'll often add a
02:51 - comment up here saying something like
02:53 - this and if you want this to be really
02:55 - neat you can even add some regions that
02:57 - allows you to easily collapse different
02:59 - parts of your codes inside of Visual
03:01 - Studio we could for example say region
03:03 - and then something like variables or
03:05 - public fields and then end region and do
03:07 - one here for unity callbacks as well so
03:09 - we can do region unity methods and down
03:12 - here we'll say in region so if we now
03:14 - save this and head back into unity we
03:16 - can create a new test script so let's go
03:18 - here c-sharp script new test scripts so
03:21 - if we now double click this to open it
03:23 - in Visual Studio we can see our new
03:25 - template you can see how you can
03:26 - collapse these regions really easily and
03:28 - of course if you want to create a
03:30 - variable now you would add it in here
03:31 - and we can collapse that a lot so of
03:33 - course configured my visual studio a bit
03:35 - as well mainly I've changed some of the
03:37 - college team I'm using is called mono
03:39 - Kai I've also switched to the default of
03:41 - having curly brackets on a new line and
03:43 - all the small formatting stuff and of
03:45 - course my window layout itself instead
03:47 - of going through and showing you how to
03:48 - add all that stuff I've exported my
03:50 - visual studio settings and I'll have a
03:52 - download link for that in the
03:53 - description so it should look something
03:55 - like this by default after downloading
03:57 - my settings file simply go to tools
03:59 - import and export settings choose import
04:02 - selected environment settings hit next
04:04 - you can choose to save your current
04:05 - settings I'm just going to hit no and
04:06 - the next I'm going to hit browse find
04:08 - the file on the system in my case it's
04:10 - going to be brekkie settings it's a good
04:12 - idea to store this it open hit next and
04:14 - you can choose what parts you want to
04:16 - import I'm just going to import all of
04:17 - them and then hit finish which is Cydia
04:19 - might complain a little bit but it
04:21 - shouldn't really matter you can see
04:22 - everything looks just the way we want it
04:24 - to also if you're using Mac unity won't
04:26 - let you download vish
04:27 - studio that's because the traditional
04:28 - version of Visual Studio only runs on
04:30 - Windows sidious after all created by
04:32 - Microsoft however recently Microsoft
04:35 - started a new project called Visual
04:37 - Studio code it has the same feel and
04:38 - vibe as the old-school Visual Studio but
04:41 - it's a lot lighter and it runs on Mac if
04:43 - you want to use that with unity you can
04:45 - again click in the description and
04:46 - download it you should also go to the
04:48 - asset store and download this free
04:50 - extension because vs code and it will
04:52 - help integrate Visual Studio code with
04:55 - unity this will give you features like
04:56 - intellisense
04:57 - and ec debugging there's a guide here on
04:59 - how to set it up if you've ever used
05:01 - Visual Studio with unity or version
05:03 - control software you know that it can
05:05 - sometimes mess up your line endings and
05:06 - that might cause unity to complain your
05:09 - version control software to complain or
05:11 - Visual Studio to complain to make sure
05:12 - that I always have consistent line
05:14 - endings I use a plugin called stripping
05:16 - I can access it by going to tools strip
05:19 - them choose my line ending type it ok
05:21 - and now every time I save a file it's
05:22 - going to save with that convention to
05:24 - download ribbon simply close down visual
05:26 - studio click the link in the description
05:27 - hit download choose adding only 4 vs
05:30 - 2015 click the file and for me it's
05:33 - going to say that it's already installed
05:35 - or it should just run through the
05:36 - installation process for you now when
05:38 - you open up visual studio again you
05:40 - should see the add-on here so that was
05:41 - my settings I hope you enjoyed them if
05:43 - you have any great tips that you feel
05:45 - like improves your way flow definitely
