00:05 - Take 32, because apparently I can't get this intro cut down to under 30 minutes
00:10 - So, hello welcome to the first tutorial done by Brackeys. I am the CEO of Brackeys and
00:19 - today, I'm going to show you how to create a survival game
00:23 - this is probably going to be a whole series because this can't be done in just one single tutorial and
00:30 - yes, let's see where this brings us, so I have opened up a new
00:39 - Unity project, it's completely empty
00:41 - and you can just do this by going to File and new project and I did not
00:49 - Import any assets
00:52 - So, this tutorial is for the beginner to the
00:58 - Intermediate, mostly for beginners, and then we'll move on to the other parts later
01:06 - So okay, let's start out by creating a ground plane for our character to move on this is going to be a first person game
01:14 - so go to game object, create other and then cube and
01:20 - let's make sure that this is in the center of the scene by going to a transform on the right hand side and
01:26 - zeroing out the x y and z transform.
01:33 - So by simply highlighting the cube in the hierarchy and then
01:37 - Taking my mouse to the perspective view and pressing F it will zoom in on the highlighted objects
01:46 - All right, now let's scale this on the x to about 50, on the y you can just leave that at 1
01:56 - and the z to again 50.  So now we have quite a huge
02:01 - ground plane for a character to stand on. Let's go to hierarchy on the left hand side rename this to
02:10 - Ground Plane
02:14 - Make sure that you notice that Unity is cap sensitive
02:19 - So I type everything in one word
02:23 - with every word starting with a capital letter, but
02:29 - just make sure that you find your own system and stick to it.
02:33 - Alright, so now let's import a character. Unity has a database with
02:40 - default characters that you can import and
02:44 - Also different kinds of packages so go right-click on the assets window,
02:50 - Go to Import Package and then character controller
02:55 - This is the scripts and graphic, oh, click import,
02:58 - this is the scripts and graphics that will make sure that we can walk around and interact with physics in our scene
03:07 - now you should get a folder called standard assets double click on this, double click on the folder called character controllers, and
03:14 - Then just take the first person controller and drag it onto the plane anywhere you want
03:22 - now if we hit F again, you can see that the
03:27 - character is indeed there in form of the cylinder and
03:32 - Let's just drag it up a little bit. So it won't
03:36 - fall through the ground when we start playing the game.
03:40 - Okay, right now our scene isn't very exciting, it is not going to be very exciting in this tutorial
03:46 - but we can at least make some light. So go to create a game object create other and then
03:53 - point lights, and so this is, as the name describes it, light emitting from one single point in a radius.
04:02 - so
04:03 - Let's just drag this up so we can see the light emitting now
04:08 - Drag this up quite a bit and then increase the range on the right hand side to about, let's say, 30, 40
04:17 - Maybe 50
04:20 - Maybe yeah
04:22 - 50 looks fine
04:26 - So, now we can navigate in our scene by pressing the play button or
04:34 - Control P, or Command P if you're on a Mac. So now here in the game view
04:40 - you can walk around and jump and
04:44 - Look anywhere you want and if you walk by the ground plane you'll be falling
04:51 - So we already have the most basic game mechanics in place
04:58 - okay, so now let's go ahead and create a skybox to make the heaven look a little less blue and
05:05 - After that, we'll be creating a house and then in the next tutorial, we'll look at the simple coding and
05:15 - some game mechanics including shooting, so
05:20 - now let's just first of all delete the
05:24 - Object called main camera, we won't be needing this because the first-person controller comes with a camera
05:30 - so, if you go to the first-person controller in the hierarchy and
05:34 - expand this with the little arrow. You can see the main cam there
05:39 - so, and over here on the right hand side you can now see all the
05:44 - components that
05:45 - this main camera has on it, has attached to it, and we can go ahead and add one
05:52 - By clicking add component then going to rendering and then skybox.
05:58 - This wants something inserted to it, so,
06:02 - Let's import some default skyboxes
06:05 - by going to our assets folder, then hitting import
06:10 - No, right-clicking, import package and then skyboxes
06:16 - So you will see this importing and this will give us about
06:20 - five, maybe six,
06:23 - skyboxes that we can use.
06:26 - So double-click on the standard assets when it's done, then skyboxes, and you can see all the different skyboxes.
06:33 - now
06:34 - again, first on the main camera,
06:36 - and then we can simply try to click and drag into the
06:40 - empty slots on the right hand side and you can see it appearing in the game view so
06:47 - Let's try the dawn/dusk. This was the one that we used for the game called "Kill Pill"
06:54 - And you can find that on our Facebook page, the first one we use this
06:59 - And, oh, by the way to maximize any window, I just
07:04 - Hold, hover my mouse over it and then press the space button, this will maximize and minimize
07:12 - That's a pretty cool feature. Okay, so let's just go with something a little more happy with a sunny
07:23 - Yes, this one. I like this one.
07:25 - Yes, that's very nice.
07:28 - Okay, so now that we have our skybox in the scene
07:34 - We can go ahead and create a house.
07:37 - So, go to game object, create other, and then cube
07:44 - and keep in mind throughout this tutorial that Unity is a game engine, it is not meant to be modeling or
07:51 - texturing or anything like that it just handles the
07:56 - scripting and the piecing everything together
08:00 - It's it's not meant to do this
08:02 - I'll just create a simple structure just so you can get familiar with the environment
08:07 - But please do this in other applications if you want something looking good, okay.
08:13 - So I have zeroed out the transform
08:16 - now we can just drag it up a little bit to see it, and hit F to maximize it, and
08:23 - Let's make this into a wall. So we'll make it longer and
08:29 - By holding down control, I can snap it
08:34 - but let's just type in a value. Let's type in maybe 5, no, this is too small, 10
08:43 - And, on the y, we want it to be like, yes, 5
08:50 - Now drag it on top of the planes. It's just resting there
08:56 - We could type in a preset number, this won't be necessary. This is fine.
09:01 - Now, we can go ahead and name this,
09:05 - house
09:08 - wall
09:10 - one,
09:11 - Zero one, and then Control-D. It's duplicated and rename this to house wall
09:18 - zero two, so now if we drag out you can see that our two walls and
09:23 - We can position them anywhere we want,
09:27 - and click on one, hold down shift, click on the other, just like, select them both, and then just drag them
09:34 - Let's duplicate them both
09:38 - Call them house wall three and house wall four and
09:45 - Then we can rotate them, so go to the rotation y and type in 90 degrees
09:51 - so we rotate them a calling and
09:54 - So now we can just drag this down
09:57 - to the side
10:01 - Do the same thing with
10:04 - number 3, so just rotate
10:07 - 90 degrees, and then just drag and drag and
10:13 - so make sure that they are even, they're pretty even, and
10:18 - This is, well, this is really bad
10:22 - Okay, so now we can just drag out the walls to make it like cubic and there you go
10:28 - we have a sealed room.  You can delete one of the walls if you want, and just play around this to make a
10:35 - smaller structure, something that our player, when we play the game can hide in, shelter in, interact with
10:44 - so that is pretty much the basics of
10:48 - Unity 3D.
10:51 - Next time we'll be stepping it up. We'll be creating
10:54 - some shooting mechanics and
10:57 - After that, we'll be creating some enemies and will spawn
11:01 - and interact just like zombies. So
11:06 - Yes, thank you for watching. Now as mentioned earlier. I am the CEO of a firm called Brackeys,
11:13 - We are working on our first
11:16 - iOS title to be released on both both the iPad and the iPhone and
11:22 - It's called "Your Game". I think it's really exciting
11:26 - I will be making updates and everything you can get on facebook.com, slash brackeys
11:33 - and soon to come our website, brackeys.com
11:38 - Click the links and support it, it means a lot,
11:42 - We're just regular people trying to get out on the web with something we make and uh,
11:50 - If you want a little heads-up on what we are creating, something in that style you can go to the Kongregate website
11:58 - there are the second version of the game
12:01 - I talked about earlier called "Kill Pill" and you can just search for "Kill Pill Tropic Islands"
12:08 - you can also find this on our website
12:11 - It's very fun. It's very easy, and thank you for watching!

Take 32, because apparently I can't get this intro cut down to under 30 minutes So, hello welcome to the first tutorial done by Brackeys.
