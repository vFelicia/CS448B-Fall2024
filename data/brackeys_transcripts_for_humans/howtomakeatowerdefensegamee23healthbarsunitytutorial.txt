00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to this video in
00:05 - creating a tower defense game in unity
00:06 - in the last video I asked you what you
00:08 - wanted to see next and a lot of you guys
00:10 - said that you wanted to see enemy health
00:12 - bars so that's exactly what we're going
00:14 - to be doing today so as you can see I'm
00:16 - in unity and I want to begin by just
00:17 - creating a canvas where we can create
00:19 - our UI so let's go over to the hierarchy
00:21 - hit right click and then UI canvas and
00:25 - we can go over and make sure that this
00:26 - is changed to a wall space canvas so we
00:28 - can have it follow our enemies around by
00:30 - going on to render mode and then
00:32 - selecting world space then we can reset
00:34 - the rect transform and you can see it's
00:36 - currently huge so let's scale this down
00:38 - to say point zero three and all axes hit
00:41 - F to focus on it and we can kind of drag
00:43 - it up to see what we're working with
00:44 - let's shift into 2d mode now and let's
00:47 - also scale this down a bit I don't want
00:49 - it to be as small as to health by itself
00:53 - because I want to leave some room in
00:54 - there in case you want to display other
00:56 - statistics about the enemies such as the
00:58 - enemy type or speed stuff like that
01:01 - let's also right-click on the disc and
01:03 - list now and go UI and let's go and
01:06 - create a new image and this is going to
01:08 - act as the background for our health bar
01:10 - so let's maybe size this down or we
01:13 - could just go over here and right click
01:15 - or hold down alt and click left click
01:18 - right here which is of course going to
01:20 - scale it horizontally when we change the
01:23 - size of our canvas but not on the
01:25 - vertical cool and then we can change the
01:28 - height to something like 10 and of
01:30 - course make sure to snap it to the
01:32 - bottom let's change the color here and
01:35 - again this is the background so we just
01:36 - want kind of a see-through black very
01:39 - neutral thing and let's also change the
01:41 - arm name here to something like health
01:44 - PG let's now duplicate this object by
01:47 - hitting control V or command T if you're
01:49 - on the Mac and make this a child object
01:52 - of the background
01:53 - let's now rename this one to our health
01:56 - actually let's do health bar and let's
01:58 - change the color to something a light
02:01 - green with a full opacity something like
02:05 - that but you should of course go ahead
02:06 - and play around with this so next up is
02:09 - of course actually resizing this health
02:11 - bar on and
02:13 - also we have to kind of put our UI under
02:15 - the enemy so let's begin by positioning
02:20 - this on top of our enemy so let's find
02:22 - our enemy prefab on the prefabs here
02:25 - drag him into the scene you can see he's
02:27 - right here let's now take our canvas
02:30 - drag that under the enemy and let's
02:33 - reset the x y&z and we have to do that
02:37 - manually so let's do C Rho 0 0 let's
02:41 - drag it up a tiny bit and move it back I
02:45 - think we're going to give it a Y
02:47 - position of 1 something like that and I
02:50 - might actually want to scale the canvas
02:52 - down a bit more I think there's plenty
02:55 - of space still for us to display all the
02:57 - information but you can always change
02:58 - that and then change the Y position
03:01 - again to one that looks pretty good
03:05 - next up we could maybe take this and
03:07 - rotate it so that it will fit or point
03:11 - towards a camera and I think we should
03:13 - rotate it about 40 degrees that looks
03:16 - much better we can move it back a bit
03:18 - and I think that's all the tweaking that
03:20 - I'm going to do right now I'm sure I'll
03:22 - come back to it before the video so with
03:24 - though so yeah this should now follow
03:27 - around our enemy and the reason why this
03:30 - works right away is because we're
03:31 - currently not rotating enemies if we
03:34 - were doing that we would probably have
03:36 - to figure out some way of having this
03:38 - canvas track the position of our enemy
03:40 - but not the rotation but I think that's
03:42 - for a future video because currently we
03:45 - aren't doing that so let's just not work
03:47 - around it until it becomes a problem if
03:49 - it ain't broken you know so um let's now
03:52 - apply this to our enemy and we should
03:54 - already see this working in the game so
03:56 - if we hit play here we should see that
03:58 - our enemy is now spawned with this
04:00 - health bar and that it follows them
04:02 - around so next up is of course making a
04:05 - change when it takes damage you can see
04:07 - currently it's totally static so what we
04:10 - do here is again we bring up our enemy
04:13 - we find our canvas our health background
04:17 - and our health bar and this is what we
04:19 - need to change
04:20 - unity has a very very handy thing for um
04:23 - kind of clipping away parts of a sprite
04:26 - and
04:27 - it's done by going over here and
04:28 - selecting a source image and you have to
04:30 - select the source image for this to work
04:32 - but we don't want any of the default
04:34 - source images because they scale really
04:37 - weirdly and things aren't looking good
04:39 - so what we want to do instead is just go
04:42 - ahead and find a totally square source
04:44 - image and preferably we would have it be
04:48 - white so that we can just control the
04:50 - color inside of unity remember when you
04:52 - have a white sprite you can totally
04:54 - control the color by tending it but if
04:56 - you have a black color you can't control
04:58 - it at all and that's because of the way
05:00 - that color is somewhat applied together
05:02 - when you multiply with one nothing
05:04 - happens but with you when you multiply
05:06 - with zero you get zero and so it will
05:09 - always be black so um what we can do is
05:12 - just jump into the tower defense as its
05:14 - back and I of course have a link to that
05:16 - in the description go on to these
05:18 - sprites and it's finally white square
05:20 - and this is something I just very
05:21 - quickly made in Photoshop it's just a
05:23 - two by two white square you can search
05:26 - for white square and Google and that
05:28 - will come up lots of images doesn't even
05:30 - have to be two by two or anything um I
05:33 - just went with this because it's very
05:36 - small and therefore won't take up any
05:37 - size so um and I've made a sprites
05:41 - folder here and you can do so as well
05:42 - and let's just drag it under there and
05:44 - let's go and make sure that we change
05:46 - our texture type so let's change that to
05:48 - straight 2d and UI let's also not
05:51 - generate MIT Maps let's change this to
05:53 - point nofilter and everything else
05:55 - should be fine so let's just hit apply
05:57 - let's now go into our health bar drag in
06:00 - our white square and you should see
06:03 - nothing changes except for the fact that
06:05 - we can now change our image height image
06:07 - type from symbol to filled and this is
06:10 - where things become interesting that's a
06:12 - radial fill which we are not going to be
06:15 - using you can do that for you can make
06:17 - that for making you can use that for
06:19 - making progress bars and stuff like that
06:21 - and then we have a horizontal one and
06:24 - you can see how that works so we now
06:27 - have this full amount that goes between
06:29 - zero for no fill and one for full fill
06:32 - and we can control this really easily
06:34 - through a script you can also change the
06:36 - origin in case you want it to go the
06:38 - other way around but I like it this way
06:41 - calm so now all we really need to do is
06:44 - jump into the place where our enemy
06:46 - takes damage and that's within the enemy
06:48 - script so let's just double click that
06:50 - to open it up in visual studio and
06:51 - really all we need to do is add a
06:54 - reference to our new image and then just
06:57 - change that parameter so first off
07:00 - because we need a reference to a UI
07:02 - element let's go up here and include
07:04 - unity engine UI let's also maybe group
07:09 - these variables together a bit because
07:10 - we have a lot of stuff that controls on
07:13 - some parameters on the enemy we have a
07:16 - death effect that we want to be
07:18 - different for each enemy and then we
07:19 - have kind of a reference to a UI element
07:22 - that we want to probably be the same for
07:25 - enemies it's a very unity specific thing
07:27 - so let's just go ahead and make a header
07:29 - here that says something like unity
07:32 - stuff just to let on the user know that
07:37 - this is something that we need to be
07:38 - able to reference but it's not something
07:40 - that you should go ahead and mess around
07:41 - with when are modifying enemies so let's
07:44 - make this a public image and we're going
07:46 - to call this one our health bar and we
07:50 - can go down to where we take damage
07:52 - which is down here and we can just set
07:55 - health bar dot fill amount equal to and
08:00 - of course we could just set it equal to
08:03 - our current health and that would
08:05 - actually somewhat not work because the
08:10 - problem here is our health start set
08:12 - starts at 100 and it ends up at zero so
08:18 - what you have is a situation where
08:20 - unless you are at 1 or 0 health um
08:23 - that's not going to be within the
08:26 - confines of between 0 & 1 so the value
08:29 - here for our health bar is a float
08:33 - number between 0 & 1 and so we need to
08:36 - have a way of figuring out what our
08:38 - maximum health is and what the least
08:41 - amount of health we can have is which is
08:42 - zero and then our kind of dividing those
08:46 - so that we can get a value and actual
08:49 - representation between 0 & 1 of what our
08:51 - health is so kind of a percentage when
08:54 - hundreds yeah so what we'll do is have
08:57 - just the way we have start speed up here
08:59 - we'll also have a one thing you might
09:03 - think is then we just go equals health
09:05 - divided by a hundred and I can see kind
09:09 - of what you're thinking here and this
09:10 - would actually work right away let's
09:12 - just try this too to see that this is
09:15 - working so let's go onto our enemy let's
09:17 - drag in our health bar let's hit apply
09:20 - on this and our enemy should just be
09:23 - working we can just leave him in here
09:24 - and we can put down a turret and you can
09:26 - see that totally works the problem
09:29 - though is when we go in and then change
09:31 - our starting health so if we go into an
09:34 - enemy now and change the start health to
09:36 - say 200 and do the same thing it's not
09:41 - going to be a correct representation
09:42 - until we get to the point where it can
09:46 - be displayed so until we get within the
09:48 - 100 health so what we do instead is we
09:51 - go up here and we create the same thing
09:53 - that we've done with our speed which is
09:55 - the start health and a current health so
09:57 - let's go and call this one our start
10:00 - health and we'll have a and we can just
10:04 - have this be private because we don't
10:06 - need to access it from anywhere and this
10:08 - is going to be our health and inside of
10:10 - our start we'll just set health equal
10:12 - not health bar health equal to the start
10:14 - health and then down here we can simply
10:19 - go health divide it by start health so
10:24 - if our start health is 100 that's going
10:27 - to be whoa my cats living on the
10:29 - keyboard there as always so um if I
10:32 - start health is a hundred and we are at
10:34 - 100 this is going to return 1 if our
10:36 - start hill health is a hundred and we
10:39 - are at 50 it's going to return 0.5 and
10:42 - you get the idea so what we get now is a
10:46 - result where let's see here where we
10:50 - should always have an accurate
10:52 - representation of our health in the
10:54 - health bar and now we should be able to
10:55 - run the game one last time and see this
10:59 - working and it should work with all
11:00 - turrets because they all use the same
11:02 - function for damaging enemies you can
11:04 - see here it works with our standard
11:06 - turret you should also be a
11:08 - to see it working with our missile
11:10 - launcher here so let's see that in
11:13 - action and indeed it does and with our
11:16 - laser turret as well awesome so that was
11:19 - pretty much all that I wanted to show
11:21 - you in this video I hope you enjoyed it
11:23 - again let me know if there's something
11:24 - you're burning to see I have a few ideas
11:26 - for what I want to do next thank you for
11:28 - all of the kind words and suggestions
11:30 - and also I feel like it's a long time
11:32 - since I've mentioned the fact that I
11:34 - have a patreon page on where you can go
11:36 - and support some monthly monthly amount
11:40 - if you want to see more videos or more
11:42 - live streams and just support the
11:44 - project in general it means the world to
11:46 - me you guys are really awesome so you
11:48 - can go to patreon.com/scishow and don't
11:53 - eight and yeah without further ado I
11:55 - will see you in the next video thanks to
11:57 - all of the awesome patreon supporters
11:59 - who donated in October and especially
12:00 - thanks to Sultan l should've faced
12:02 - lemare Fi and James Calhoun become a
12:04 - supporter at patreon.com slash breakfast

thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to this video in creating a tower defense game in unity in the last video I asked you what you wanted to see next and a lot of you guys said

it and we can kind of drag it up to see what we're working with let's shift into 2d mode now and let's also scale this down a bit I don't want it to be as small as to health by itself because I want to leave some room in there in case you want to display other statistics about the enemies such as the enemy type or speed stuff like that let's also rightclick on the disc and list now and go UI and let's go and create a new image and this is going to act as the background for our health bar so let's maybe size this down or we could just go over here and right click or hold down alt and click left click right here which is of course going to scale it horizontally when we change the size of our canvas but not on the vertical cool and then we can change the height to something like 10 and of course make sure to snap it to the bottom let's change the color here and again this is the background so we just want kind of a seethrough black very neutral thing and let's also change the arm name here to something like health PG let's now duplicate this object by hitting control V or command T if you're on the Mac and make this a child object of the background let's now rename this one to our health actually let's do health bar and let's change the color to something a light green with a full opacity something like that but you should of course go ahead and play around with this so next up is of course actually resizing this health bar on and also we have to kind of put our UI under the enemy so let's begin by positioning this on top of our enemy so let's find our enemy prefab on the prefabs here drag him into the scene you can see he's right here let's now take our canvas drag that under the enemy and let's reset the x y&z and we have to do that manually so let's do C Rho 0 0 let's drag it up a tiny bit and move it back I think we're going to give it a Y position of 1 something like that and I might actually want to scale the canvas down a bit more I think there's plenty of space still for us to display all the information but you can always change that and then change the Y position again to one that looks pretty good next up we could maybe take this and rotate it so that it will fit or point towards a camera and I think we should rotate it about 40 degrees that looks much better we can move it back a bit and I think that's all the tweaking that I'm going to do right now I'm sure I'll come back to it before the video so with though so yeah this should now follow around our enemy and the reason why this works right away is because we're currently not rotating enemies if we were doing that we would probably have to figure out some way of having this canvas track the position of our enemy but not the rotation but I think that's for a future video because
