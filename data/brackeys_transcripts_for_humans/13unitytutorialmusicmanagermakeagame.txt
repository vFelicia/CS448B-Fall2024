00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number 13 and make a
00:07 - game a cool series on making a video
00:09 - game in unity this is just a really cool
00:12 - tip on making a music manager that will
00:17 - store all of your music and the cool
00:20 - thing about this is that we can control
00:22 - it control where it lives in the scene
00:24 - so that the music won't start over every
00:27 - time you play a new scene this is just a
00:30 - quick video because I've been so busy
00:32 - with making ten-hour games it's a cool
00:36 - event that I'm going to launch hopefully
00:38 - in the next couple of Victor of weeks if
00:40 - you want some information about it go to
00:43 - facebook.com slash break ease I've
00:45 - written just a quick teaser there and I
00:48 - hope to see many of you participate in
00:50 - the event
00:50 - cool so let's get started with today's
00:53 - video so as always I've opened our unity
00:55 - and let's just go ahead and write into
01:00 - it so we can see right now we have the
01:02 - DM objects and this object has a game
01:05 - master script that sets up everything we
01:08 - need and the relaxed music component on
01:11 - it what we're going to do instead is
01:13 - we're going to create a music manager
01:15 - empty game object with the audio source
01:18 - and make that spawn in so let's
01:21 - right-click on the audio source hit copy
01:24 - component and then just remove it then
01:28 - let's go to game object create empty or
01:30 - press control shift n then let's rename
01:35 - this to underscore mm for music manager
01:39 - or you can just do underscore music if
01:42 - you want now we can go ahead and Center
01:47 - out the position so right click on the
01:49 - transform and hit reset position and so
01:55 - it will be in the center of the scene
01:56 - that's just nice for these kind of
01:58 - objects then we can go ahead and right
02:01 - click on the transform again and hit
02:03 - paste component as new and it will paste
02:06 - the audio source with all of the right
02:09 - values then we can go ahead and add a
02:12 - tack
02:13 - I've already created a tag called mm you
02:17 - can of course call it whatever you want
02:18 - by going under add tag expanding the
02:22 - size and then just typing it in as an
02:24 - element then again selecting the object
02:26 - and selecting the tag great now we can
02:31 - go ahead and make the center prefab by
02:32 - dragging it on to the project pane now
02:35 - we can delete the object from our scene
02:38 - because we're going to spawn it in
02:39 - through code so let's find our TM object
02:42 - and this is just an empty object with
02:45 - the gamemaster script we can double
02:47 - click this to open it up in monodevelop
02:50 - and let me just zoom in on the text here
02:53 - today I will remember to sue min because
02:56 - many times I've forgotten it and you
02:59 - guys got a little angry there huh this
03:02 - time I will make sure to do it but as
03:04 - always monodevelop is sparking outs so
03:08 - I'll just have to quickly end the task
03:09 - here and restart it it happens so here
03:15 - let's try this again right so now I'll
03:20 - zoom in great so the functionality we
03:25 - are going to be making is actually quite
03:27 - simple all we need to do is first off
03:29 - create a variable that's going to store
03:31 - our music prefab so let's just do var um
03:35 - music prefab of type transform then in
03:43 - the function start we are going to spawn
03:46 - this in but we don't want to spawn it in
03:48 - every time we load the scene because we
03:52 - want this to live throughout scenes we
03:54 - don't want it to destroy when loading a
03:56 - new scene and so if we both don't
03:59 - destroy it when loading the scene and
04:01 - create a new one we are going to just
04:04 - going to stack up the music prefabs and
04:06 - therefore we're going to check if
04:08 - there's a music prefab in the scene we
04:11 - do this by saying if game object dot
04:17 - find game object with tag and make sure
04:20 - that its game object in singular or
04:22 - you're going to get a hole away and then
04:24 - in here you simply input a string
04:27 - in our case it's mmm and close it off
04:30 - there and then open up the brackets so
04:36 - right now we're saying that if we can
04:38 - find a game object called mm but we want
04:41 - to say if we can find a game object
04:43 - called mm so then we just put a
04:47 - exclamation mark
04:49 - right in front of the code and it will
04:50 - say if we cannot find a game object with
04:53 - the tag mm then we're going to do
04:55 - something here and the thing we're going
04:57 - to do is we're going to instantiate our
05:02 - music prefab at just the same position
05:06 - as this object and with 0 comma 0 comma
05:11 - 0 rotation so that's a shortcut for that
05:14 - called catonian dot o qua return yin dud
05:21 - identity that will just make it spawn
05:25 - with that no rotation at all so just
05:28 - close that off and the parentheses but
05:31 - we want to do something more because
05:33 - right now we're just spawning in their
05:34 - object we also want to tell unity that
05:37 - this object shouldn't be destroyed when
05:39 - a new scene is loaded so let's first off
05:42 - make a reference to this make this into
05:44 - a variable so we can change it so we do
05:47 - this by adding var in front of the
05:49 - instantiate function and then we could
05:52 - call it men M manager equals instantiate
05:59 - blah blah blah so now we're simply
06:01 - saying that we want to instantiate
06:03 - something and when we refer to this
06:06 - instance of the object it will be called
06:09 - a manager so what we can do down here is
06:12 - we can then tell unity to
06:15 - do different stuff with that object but
06:18 - we before we do that let's just save
06:20 - this and see how it works in unity right
06:23 - now so when we hit play first off we
06:27 - have to of course drag in the music
06:29 - prefab so let's just find it under our
06:32 - assets here drag in the music there then
06:36 - we can hit apply to the prefab here
06:40 - let's hit play so as soon as we play the
06:43 - music starts playing and we can see that
06:46 - a music clone has spawned into a scene
06:49 - whenever instantiating something unity
06:52 - renames it with a clone after I don't
06:56 - really like that so we can go ahead and
06:57 - change the name of it while making sure
07:00 - that it won't continue on to other
07:03 - scenes so right now if we continue
07:05 - playing here and if we jump down game
07:10 - over we can see that it will instantiate
07:13 - a new one so the music will just restart
07:18 - and then could get really annoying
07:20 - because then you will hear the same
07:22 - parts of the music all the time so
07:24 - instead let's first off do em manager
07:28 - that name just to clean up the name a
07:31 - bit equals music prefab dot name
07:36 - so instead we're just setting this
07:38 - instance of the object to the name of
07:41 - the prefab and then after that we can
07:43 - use what's called don't destroy unload
07:46 - oops am i timing is wrong it don't
07:49 - destroy onload I'm pretty sure that's
07:54 - how and then we open up yeah for some
07:56 - reason unity didn't suggest it but
07:59 - that's how it it's typed and then don't
08:03 - destroy a new load and then you simply
08:05 - input a target and then we just do M
08:08 - manager so now it spawns the object
08:14 - calls it a manager make sure that its
08:16 - name is the same as the prefab and then
08:19 - it makes sure that it won't get
08:21 - destroyed so now when we hit play the
08:26 - music object is created
08:29 - and when we jump down game over the
08:35 - music will just keep on playing and so
08:38 - we can advance in our game without the
08:40 - music repeating that was basically it
08:44 - for this video I know it was a short one
08:46 - but I just wanted to get this out of the
08:47 - way I have a lot of exciting stuff
08:49 - coming so stay tuned thanks for watching
08:52 - and I'll see you in the next video
