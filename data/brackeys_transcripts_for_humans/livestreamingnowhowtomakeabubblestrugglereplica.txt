00:00 - hello one just want to let you know that
00:01 - I will be live-streaming in just a
00:03 - moment over on Twitch it's going to be
00:05 - really fun today I'm really looking
00:07 - forward to it basically what we're going
00:09 - to be making is kind of a bubble
00:12 - struggle replicant if you're not
00:14 - familiar with bubble struggle I'm just
00:15 - gonna show you what it is we aim to
00:17 - create so this is something that I just
00:19 - prepared for this video and you can see
00:21 - there's this ball jumping around and if
00:23 - we hit it with our arrow here that we
00:25 - can decide when we want to shoot it
00:27 - we'll split in two and it will keep
00:29 - doing that until we reach kind of the
00:30 - final one that is small enough that we
00:32 - can just pop it and if we get hit by one
00:35 - of these balls it's just going to start
00:37 - over and we lost the game and this is
00:39 - something that's really really fun
00:40 - because it's it's really really simple
00:42 - to set up initially but you can do a lot
00:45 - of things with it and there's a lot of
00:47 - stuff that you can customize without
00:49 - writing any code you can see here are my
00:51 - four ball prefabs and they basically
00:54 - just link to each other and we can have
00:56 - several others in there you can
00:58 - customize different properties such as
00:59 - mass and speed and start forests and
01:03 - colors all that to make the game varied
01:06 - and fun and create a lot of levels
01:07 - really quickly and of course we're going
01:09 - to be creating some the basic player
01:11 - controls setting everything up from
01:13 - scraps scratch so I really hope to see
01:15 - you over there at the end we are also
01:17 - going to do a live Q&A as we've done the
01:20 - other times it's always a blast so if
01:22 - you're ending in any way interested
01:23 - that's awesome and I look forward to
01:25 - seeing you there in case you missed it
01:27 - it will also be live on the YouTube
01:29 - channel as soon as I kind of package it
01:31 - up and maybe cut out a few embarrassing
01:33 - pipes so yeah it will be on the channel
01:36 - as well so yeah I look forward to seeing
01:38 - you there and I'll see you in a second
