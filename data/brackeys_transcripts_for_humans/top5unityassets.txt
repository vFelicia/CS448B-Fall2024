00:00 - one of the most common questions that I
00:01 - get asked is what assets I use when I
00:03 - make games and for good reason picking
00:05 - up a good editor extension or model pack
00:07 - can save you countless hours of
00:09 - development time so I hopped on Twitter
00:11 - and asked you guys if you wanted to see
00:13 - a video on the assets that I use the
00:15 - most and the response was overwhelming
00:17 - so here they are my favorite unity
00:20 - assets first off we have pro builder pro
00:22 - builder is an awesome tool for building
00:24 - and editing geometry inside of unity in
00:26 - my opinion it's actually the best
00:28 - prototyping tools you've ever hit the
00:29 - stored just because you can so easily
00:31 - sketch out a level Pro Bowler comes in
00:33 - two versions basic which is free and
00:35 - advanced the free version has all the
00:37 - basic mesh editing tools but without a
00:39 - lot of the stuff that you expect to see
00:41 - in a dedicated modeling software so if
00:42 - you want stuff like editing movies mesh
00:44 - mirroring and export to obj you will
00:47 - have to upgrade fun fact one of the
00:48 - games that I'm looking forward to the
00:50 - most at the moment manifold garden is
00:52 - actually built entirely using pro
00:54 - builder next it's a free asset by unity
00:56 - that has for some reason gone under the
00:58 - radar a little bit I'm talking about the
00:59 - unity particle pack this pack is filled
01:01 - with explosions fire lightning rain and
01:04 - all kinds of cool effects it's really
01:06 - nice to see a particle effects pack of
01:09 - this quality and I've already used it in
01:11 - a bunch of projects now it's time for
01:12 - the only paid asset on the list
01:15 - Odin Odin basically just makes sure
01:17 - inspector much more powerful with Odin
01:19 - you can serialize anything from
01:20 - dictionaries to delicates and it has to
01:22 - be 50 attributes for adding stuff like
01:24 - buttons color palettes and tabs if your
01:27 - program is looking to improve your
01:28 - workflow
01:29 - I really recommend picking up Odin as
01:31 - our fourth asset we have another editor
01:33 - extension text mesh Pro Tex much pro is
01:35 - a complete revamp of anything text in
01:37 - unity it makes your text render nicer
01:39 - it's super performant and it has a lot
01:41 - of layout and styling controls I
01:43 - actually have a video on setting up and
01:45 - using text much bro spoiler alert it's
01:48 - really easy Tex Mex pro was recently
01:50 - acquired by unity and is now free of
01:51 - charge so that's pretty awesome
01:53 - and the final asset on the list rock and
01:56 - boulders
01:57 - now this pack rocks if you ever designed
02:01 - an outdoor scene you know that something
02:03 - you pretty much always need is rocks and
02:06 - I have never seen as nice-looking rocks
02:07 - as these of course this acid is also
02:10 - free that's pretty much my list of
02:12 - favorite assets I've created a list on
02:14 - the asset store with all of them and a
02:16 - few others that I couldn't squeeze into
02:18 - the video on the link for that in the
02:19 - description now really try to keep this
02:21 - video short but I have so many more
02:23 - assets that I want to share with you if
