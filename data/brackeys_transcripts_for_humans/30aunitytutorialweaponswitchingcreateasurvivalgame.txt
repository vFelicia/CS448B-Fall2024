00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to video
00:05 - number 30 in our Survival game series
00:07 - down by Braes I'm the CEO of Braes and
00:10 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:13 - at a much much better method for doing
00:16 - weapon switching than the one we had
00:18 - before so we are basically going to
00:19 - create a whole new script which is going
00:22 - to take care of stuff like uh being able
00:25 - to switch weapons using the scroll reel
00:28 - and uh also the different numbers on the
00:31 - keyboard and so we can have more than
00:34 - just two weapons that will toggle on and
00:36 - off uh so that's really exciting uh and
00:40 - let me just quickly show you uh this
00:43 - drawing I made uh just to show the basic
00:47 - functionality of the script we're going
00:49 - to be
00:50 - making uh so it's basically split up
00:53 - into two parts the right hand side
00:55 - inside of the square here and the left
00:58 - hand side and over here we're going to
01:00 - be changing uh a variable and this is
01:03 - just going to be changing a number and
01:06 - we're going to do that depending on the
01:07 - scroll reel and the uh button or the
01:10 - number buttons and over in the left hand
01:14 - side we are going to uh enable and
01:17 - disable different weapons depending on
01:20 - that
01:22 - variable okay so let's go through this
01:24 - uh rather quickly um the variable
01:27 - everything is depending on is the
01:29 - current weapon and that's going to range
01:32 - from zero to the max weapons so the
01:36 - maximum uh number of weapons we want to
01:39 - carry uh so if we set the max weapons to
01:42 - two we're going to be able to car Carry
01:45 - Three weapons because the current weapon
01:48 - will go from zero to one and to two and
01:52 - we're going to be able to add onto that
01:55 - or subtract from that uh using the
01:57 - scroll wheel up and down input
02:01 - or we are going to be using the input.
02:03 - get key down 1 = 0 2 = 1 3 = 2 and so on
02:10 - if this is not clear to you yet it
02:12 - hopefully will be uh it's a little bit
02:15 - confusing uh confusing with all the
02:18 - numbers and
02:19 - so okay so once we have this current
02:22 - weapon uh variable under our control uh
02:26 - we will send it over to another function
02:28 - called select weapon
02:30 - and this will basically find the
02:32 - children of our me object so find all of
02:36 - the different weapons parented to that
02:38 - uh object and then it's going to assign
02:41 - numbers to each weapon so um the first
02:44 - one is going to be zero the next one's
02:47 - going to be one and so on then it's
02:50 - going to search through and disable all
02:53 - the weapons that doesn't have a number
02:55 - that matches the current weapon once it
02:58 - finds the weapon with a number number
03:00 - that matches the current weapon then
03:02 - it's going to enable
03:04 - it then it's going to check if the uh
03:08 - weapon uh is actually a weapon or if
03:11 - it's just uh
03:13 - fists and so if it's just a fists weapon
03:17 - so you don't want the uh the animation
03:20 - to play a swing animation but instead
03:23 - instead wanted to play a punch or this
03:25 - could also uh be the case for different
03:27 - kinds of weapons if you want dagers to
03:30 - have some sorts of animations and swords
03:33 - to have others uh then you can check
03:35 - here whether or not it's a sword whether
03:38 - or not it's a dager and if it is it's
03:41 - going to enable the weapon on meaning
03:43 - that we're going to play Swing
03:45 - animations and if it's not a weapon we
03:48 - going to disable the weapon on and so it
03:50 - will play Punch animations and you can
03:52 - have the pr same principle going with
03:55 - different kinds of weapons but to keep
03:58 - this simple we'll just have the weapon
04:00 - or not
04:02 - weapon okay so as always I've opened up
04:05 - unity and you can see we have our arms
04:07 - set up here as always and under the
04:11 - player you can find them under our main
04:14 - camera and there we have the arms
04:17 - 05 and if we just go through the rig or
04:20 - the amateure we will find the uh empty
04:24 - game object holding all of our weapons
04:26 - so under our arm Armature go to master
04:30 - inner arm right and again you you don't
04:32 - need this complete rig you can of course
04:34 - get it from our website for free uh but
04:37 - you can also just have any kind of empty
04:40 - game object and parent weapons to that
04:43 - uh but in our case we have it inside of
04:45 - this rig since we wanted to follow the
04:47 - animation of our
04:48 - arms okay so under the hand right the
04:52 - hold right and then the me we have our
04:54 - different weapons so this is where we
04:57 - want to create the new script
05:00 - so go to add
05:03 - component and then call and then new
05:07 - script and let's call this
05:09 - weapon
05:12 - switching
05:15 - 02 um and whoops I've already done that
05:18 - I'm just going to do test after that but
05:21 - in the assets pack it will be called
05:23 - zero2 and the language is going to be
05:26 - JavaScript now hit the create an ad
05:29 - button
05:30 - and we can double click it to open it up
05:32 - in mono
05:37 - develop here we
05:39 - go okay so we are going to rename the
05:42 - function start to function awake and
05:45 - we're going to use that later so for now
05:47 - we can just keep that uh but I will
05:50 - space out the bracket keys I just like
05:52 - it this way uh I think it it keeps it
05:55 - more
05:56 - organized okay so let's first declare
05:59 - some variables
06:00 - and two you know we are going to be
06:02 - needing are the current weapon and the
06:05 - number of weapons so let's type VAR
06:08 - current
06:09 - weapon equals zero by
06:13 - default then a new one VAR and let's
06:16 - call this Max
06:19 - weapons and it's going to be equal to
06:21 - two by
06:23 - default and remember whenever this is
06:26 - two the maximum number of weapons we're
06:29 - going to be carry uh be able to carry is
06:32 - going to be three because we count this
06:35 - zero okay great uh we are also going to
06:38 - need one last variable though and this
06:40 - is going to be the animator and that's
06:43 - because we want to access our animated
06:46 - controller if you have one uh we have
06:48 - for this series and uh we want to be
06:52 - able to set the uh controller uh tell
06:56 - the controller that we have a weapon
06:58 - equipped or that we don't and so uh we
07:02 - want the animator so type y the
07:06 - animator of
07:09 - type animator with a
07:13 - capital there we go actually let's make
07:16 - that one
07:18 - decapitalized great so now in the
07:20 - function update we want to create the
07:22 - part where we changed the current weapon
07:25 - so inside the function update we'll
07:28 - write if
07:32 - input. get
07:35 - axis oops get
07:38 - axis and then open
07:41 - parentheses Mouse scroll
07:47 - reel like that remember the capital
07:50 - letters it's very
07:52 - important close
07:54 - parenthesis is less than one or zero
07:58 - sorry is less than zero then we want
08:01 - something to
08:03 - happen what we want to happen is we want
08:06 - to say
08:09 - if current
08:13 - weapon +
08:15 - 1 is less than or equal
08:19 - to Max
08:28 - weapons now like
08:31 - that then we want something to happen
08:33 - again so
08:36 - there and that is current
08:40 - weapon
08:42 - Plus+ so the current weapon should be
08:45 - one more than it already is we could
08:49 - also say plus equals
08:52 - 1 if the current weapon + one is is less
08:57 - than or equal to Max weapon we want uh
09:01 - to add one to the current weapon if not
09:06 - so
09:09 - else we want the current weapon to be
09:16 - zero current
09:19 - weapon equals
09:23 - zero and then a
09:26 - semicolon and under here
09:30 - we will
09:31 - type uh whoops let me just make sure I
09:35 - get this right so under the L statement
09:40 - we want to type select
09:46 - weapon current
09:49 - weapon and the select weapon is the name
09:53 - of our uh function where we will
09:56 - actually select the weapon and disable
09:59 - all the others and we want to send with
10:03 - it the current weapon
10:05 - variable so uh all of this is not
10:08 - something I'm going to go into too much
10:11 - detail about because it's really hard to
10:13 - explain but basically we're just making
10:16 - sure that when we bump up the scroll
10:18 - wheel it will uh add one and when we
10:22 - bump it down it will subtract one and uh
10:27 - it's going to do this as long as as it's
10:29 - inside the max weapons range uh and so
10:35 - so under this if statement we want to
10:38 - type else
10:41 - if
10:43 - input. get
10:48 - axis
10:52 - Mouse scroll reel
10:59 - is bigger than
11:02 - zero so if we are scrolling the other
11:08 - way we want to do something
11:11 - else and here we want to check if
11:15 - current
11:18 - weapon minus
11:20 - one so we really just reversing the
11:24 - process is bigger than or equal to zero
11:33 - open up the bracket
11:36 - Keys current
11:41 - weapon minus
11:43 - minus semic
11:47 - Cod so that if the uh if we don't get
11:52 - the uh if the mouse scroll wheel is less
11:55 - than zero we want to add on to it and if
11:59 - if it's uh if it's more than zero we
12:02 - want to subtract from it um so we are so
12:07 - if the current weapon minus one is less
12:11 - than or or is more than or equal to zero
12:14 - we want to
12:15 - subtract else so here we're just making
12:18 - sure that it won't go below zero
12:24 - else the C weapon
12:34 - equals Max
12:37 - weapons so it will Loop that way so
12:40 - whenever we get below zero it will jump
12:43 - up to the maximum amount and so we can
12:45 - just keep on scrolling
12:48 - through and a
12:51 - semicolon okay so uh if this was
12:54 - confusing you uh it's completely
12:57 - understandable uh it was confusing me
13:00 - when I just started out making this type
13:02 - of logic uh but I just thought that we
13:05 - should put this in our game uh because
13:07 - it's really really a much much better uh
13:12 - way to do
13:13 - things uh so after the L statement
13:16 - statement we type
13:18 - select
13:20 - weapon again we calling the
13:23 - function current
13:27 - weapon there
13:30 - okay so uh that's it for the scroll real
13:35 - part of things now we're going to make
13:38 - sure that it will Loop correctly and
13:41 - soell so after the else if you're going
13:44 - to type
13:47 - if current
13:51 - weapon is equal
13:53 - [Music]
13:55 - to Max weapons
14:01 - +
14:02 - one in the
14:07 - parenthesis and inside of the bracket
14:09 - keys we're going to type current
14:13 - weapon equals
14:17 - zero so if the current
14:20 - weapon is one bigger than Max weapons it
14:24 - should be zero so if it exceeds the max
14:27 - weapons amount we'll Loop it back to
14:30 - zero and we can keep on
14:33 - scrolling if it and then we're going to
14:36 - type in another if
14:38 - statement so
14:40 - if current
14:45 - weapon is equal
14:49 - to minus
14:55 - one and then the bracket
14:58 - keys then we're going to type current
15:02 - weapon
15:04 - equals Max
15:07 - weapons so if it gets below zero it will
15:10 - loop back to the max weapons
15:14 - amount uh okay so that's all we're going
15:17 - to do for looping and so on now we
15:21 - should actually be able to uh play this
15:24 - and have it work except we just need to
15:27 - add the function uh but for now will
15:29 - just have no logic inside it just to
15:31 - test if things are working so go down
15:34 - type function and we're going to type um
15:39 - let's call this select weapon so
15:42 - select
15:43 - weapon and we are taking some input and
15:47 - let's just call this input
15:51 - index that's just a standard uh name for
15:54 - the uh for an input
15:57 - number and it's going to to be a type
16:00 - integer and now we can just close off
16:04 - the bracket Keys uh not typing in any
16:08 - logic yet so save that let's head into
16:12 - unity and see if we get any
16:14 - errors it looks like we are error free
16:18 - and we have some new variables here so
16:21 - uh if we hit play
16:23 - now and scroll
16:26 - up the variable will start Chang
16:29 - changing and if we scroll down it will
16:33 - change the other way so we can scroll
16:36 - and it will Loop just like we wanted to
16:41 - and you can of course uh reverse the
16:44 - mouse scroll Wheel by just changing this
16:48 - sign so if we change this to bigger than
16:52 - and this
16:53 - to smaller than then we have reversed
16:57 - the scrolling effect so if we hit play
17:00 - now and I scroll the other
17:02 - way oops selected the wrong object here
17:07 - I play now and scroll the other way now
17:09 - when I scroll up it goes to two so it's
17:12 - adds on and when I scroll down it
17:17 - subtracts okay great so now let's go
17:20 - back in here and let's create the
17:23 - function uh that will allow us to just
17:25 - press buttons in order to press uh to
17:29 - change weapons so make some more space
17:32 - in the update function and let's type if
17:35 - and this is really much more simple uh
17:38 - let's type if input. getet key
17:43 - down and then open up parentheses key
17:47 - code. alpha 1 and the alpha 1 is
17:52 - basically just the numbers that are not
17:54 - on the keypad uh on the keypad on your
17:57 - keyboard so just the basic numbers on
18:00 - top of all of the
18:02 - letters and we want the alpha 1 and not
18:05 - the alpha zero because that's just
18:08 - standard for Shooters uh so remember
18:12 - that uh okay so let's close the those
18:15 - off and open up some bracket
18:18 - Keys whoops I'm making a lot of tyos but
18:21 - I can't see the keyboard because of the
18:24 - huge microphone shuft in my face so uh
18:27 - sorry about that but we'll continue on
18:30 - so if we press the one key we want the
18:34 - current weapon to be equal to
18:37 - zero and we want the select
18:40 - weapon to be
18:42 - called with the current
18:44 - weapon variable else we will only change
18:47 - the number and not call the function to
18:50 - actually change the
18:51 - weapons and uh remember you have to
18:54 - create as many of these if statements as
18:57 - the maximum number of weapons you want
19:00 - so if you want three weapons uh to be
19:02 - the max you'll have to uh change these
19:06 - if statements uh so create uh if
19:09 - statements for that number so if input.
19:13 - get key
19:15 - [Music]
19:16 - down get key down
19:20 - there key
19:24 - code do alpha 2
19:29 - close it
19:32 - off then we want the current
19:38 - weapon equal to be equal to
19:42 - one and we again want to uh call the
19:45 - select
19:48 - weapon with the current
19:51 - weapon also and now you can just go
19:55 - ahead and duplicate this down below
19:59 - adjust it to so it fits this should be
20:02 - Alpha 3 and this should be two and now
20:06 - we should be good to go so let's go
20:08 - inside of unity and see if this is
20:09 - working so I hit
20:12 - play and when I hit the uh when I hit
20:16 - the two key it changes to one when I hit
20:19 - the three key it changes to two and when
20:22 - I hit one it changes back to zero and I
20:25 - can again still adjust this using the
20:27 - scroll reel which is what I'm doing now
20:30 - and so you can really get some nice
20:32 - results and uh have the player use the
20:35 - method he
20:37 - wants okay awesome so now we want to
20:40 - actually call the uh weapon
20:44 - switching uh stuff but uh I can see that
20:48 - this is turning out to be quite a long
20:50 - video so I'm going to cut it up uh off
20:53 - here and uh we'll take care of that in
20:55 - the next video so uh I hope hope you
20:58 - guys enjoyed it I know this was quite
21:01 - difficult stuff uh but I'm sure you will
21:04 - understand as we go forward so thanks
21:07 - for watching and I'll see you in the
21:08 - next video
21:11 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to video number 30 in our Survival game series down by Braes I'm the CEO of Braes and in this video we're going to take a look at a much much better method for doing weapon switching than the one we had before so we are basically going to create a whole new script which is going to take care of stuff like uh being able to switch weapons using the scroll reel and uh also the different numbers on the keyboard and so we can have more than just two weapons that will toggle on and off uh so that's really exciting uh and let me just quickly show you uh this drawing I made uh just to show the basic functionality of the script we're going to be making uh so it's basically split up into two parts the right hand side inside of the square here and the left hand side and over here we're going to be changing uh a variable and this is just going to be changing a number and we're going to do that depending on the scroll reel and the uh button or the number buttons and over in the left hand side we are going to uh enable and disable different weapons depending on that variable okay so let's go through this uh rather quickly um the variable everything is depending on is the current weapon and that's going to range from zero to the max weapons so the maximum uh number of weapons we want to carry uh so if we set the max weapons to two we're going to be able to car Carry Three weapons because the current weapon will go from zero to one and to two and we're going to be able to add onto that or subtract from that uh using the scroll wheel up and down input or we are going to be using the input. get key down 1 = 0 2 = 1 3 = 2 and so on if this is not clear to you yet it hopefully will be uh it's a little bit confusing uh confusing with all the numbers and so okay so once we have this current weapon uh variable under our control uh we will send it over to another function called select weapon and this will basically find the children of our me object so find all of the different weapons parented to that uh object and then it's going to assign numbers to each weapon so um the first one is going to be zero the next one's going to be one and so on then it's going to search through and disable all the weapons that doesn't have a number that matches the current weapon once it finds the weapon with a number number that matches the current weapon then it's going to enable it then it's going to check if the uh weapon uh is actually a weapon or if it's just uh fists and so if it's just a fists weapon so you don't want the uh the animation to play a swing animation but instead instead wanted to play a punch or this could also uh be the case for different kinds of weapons if you want dagers to have some sorts of animations and swords to have others uh then you can check here whether or not it's a sword whether or not it's a dager and if it is it's going to enable the weapon on meaning that we're going to play Swing animations and if it's not a weapon we going to disable the weapon on and so it will play Punch animations and you can have the pr same principle going with different kinds of weapons but to keep this simple we'll just have the weapon or not weapon okay so as always I've opened up unity and you can see we have our arms set up here as always and under the player you can find them under our main camera and there we have the arms 05 and if we just go through the rig or the amateure we will find the uh empty game object holding all of our weapons so under our arm Armature go to master inner arm right and again you you don't need this complete rig you can of course get it from our website for free uh but you can also just have any kind of empty game object and parent weapons to that uh but in our case we have it inside of this rig since we wanted to follow the animation of our arms okay so under the hand right the hold right and then the me we have our different weapons so this is where we want to create the new script so go to add component and then call and then new script and let's call this weapon switching 02 um and whoops I've already done that I'm just going to do test after that but in the assets pack it will be called zero2 and the language is going to be JavaScript now hit the create an ad button and we can double click it to open it up in mono develop here we go okay so we are going to rename the function start to function awake and we're going to use that later so for now we can just keep that uh but I will space out the bracket keys I just like it this way uh I think it it keeps it more organized okay so let's first declare some variables and two you know we are going to be needing are the current weapon and the number of weapons so let's type VAR current weapon equals zero by default then a new one VAR and let's call this Max weapons and it's going to be equal to two by default and remember whenever this is two the maximum number of weapons we're going to be carry uh be able to carry is going to be three because we count this zero okay great uh we are also going to need one last variable though and this is going to be the animator and that's because we want to access our animated controller if you have one uh we have for this series and uh we want to be able to set the uh controller uh tell the controller that we have a weapon equipped or that we don't and so uh we want the animator so type y the animator of type animator with a capital there we go actually let's make that one decapitalized great so now in the function update we want to create the part where we changed the current weapon so inside the function update we'll write if input. get axis oops get axis and then open parentheses Mouse scroll reel like that remember the capital letters it's very important close parenthesis is less than one or zero sorry is less than zero then we want something to happen what we want to happen is we want to say if current weapon + 1 is less than or equal to Max weapons now like that then we want something to happen again so there and that is current weapon Plus+ so the current weapon should be one more than it already is we could also say plus equals 1 if the current weapon + one is is less than or equal to Max weapon we want uh to add one to the current weapon if not so else we want the current weapon to be zero current weapon equals zero and then a semicolon and under here we will type uh whoops let me just make sure I get this right so under the L statement we want to type select weapon current weapon and the select weapon is the name of our uh function where we will actually select the weapon and disable all the others and we want to send with it the current weapon variable so uh all of this is not something I'm going to go into too much detail about because it's really hard to explain but basically we're just making sure that when we bump up the scroll wheel it will uh add one and when we bump it down it will subtract one and uh it's going to do this as long as as it's inside the max weapons range uh and so so under this if statement we want to type else if input. get axis Mouse scroll reel is bigger than zero so if we are scrolling the other way we want to do something else and here we want to check if current weapon minus one so we really just reversing the process is bigger than or equal to zero open up the bracket Keys current weapon minus minus semic Cod so that if the uh if we don't get the uh if the mouse scroll wheel is less than zero we want to add on to it and if if it's uh if it's more than zero we want to subtract from it um so we are so if the current weapon minus one is less than or or is more than or equal to zero we want to subtract else so here we're just making sure that it won't go below zero else the C weapon equals Max weapons so it will Loop that way so whenever we get below zero it will jump up to the maximum amount and so we can just keep on scrolling through and a semicolon okay so uh if this was confusing you uh it's completely understandable uh it was confusing me when I just started out making this type of logic uh but I just thought that we should put this in our game uh because it's really really a much much better uh way to do things uh so after the L statement statement we type select weapon again we calling the function current weapon there okay so uh that's it for the scroll real part of things now we're going to make sure that it will Loop correctly and soell so after the else if you're going to type if current weapon is equal to Max weapons + one in the parenthesis and inside of the bracket keys we're going to type current weapon equals zero so if the current weapon is one bigger than Max weapons it should be zero so if it exceeds the max weapons amount we'll Loop it back to zero and we can keep on scrolling if it and then we're going to type in another if statement so if current weapon is equal to minus one and then the bracket keys then we're going to type current weapon equals Max weapons so if it gets below zero it will loop back to the max weapons amount uh okay so that's all we're going to do for looping and so on now we should actually be able to uh play this and have it work except we just need to add the function uh but for now will just have no logic inside it just to test if things are working so go down type function and we're going to type um let's call this select weapon so select weapon and we are taking some input and let's just call this input index that's just a standard uh name for the uh for an input number and it's going to to be a type integer and now we can just close off the bracket Keys uh not typing in any logic yet so save that let's head into unity and see if we get any errors it looks like we are error free and we have some new variables here so uh if we hit play now and scroll up the variable will start Chang changing and if we scroll down it will change the other way so we can scroll and it will Loop just like we wanted to and you can of course uh reverse the mouse scroll Wheel by just changing this sign so if we change this to bigger than and this to smaller than then we have reversed the scrolling effect so if we hit play now and I scroll the other way oops selected the wrong object here I play now and scroll the other way now when I scroll up it goes to two so it's adds on and when I scroll down it subtracts okay great so now let's go back in here and let's create the function uh that will allow us to just press buttons in order to press uh to change weapons so make some more space in the update function and let's type if and this is really much more simple uh let's type if input. getet key down and then open up parentheses key code. alpha 1 and the alpha 1 is basically just the numbers that are not on the keypad uh on the keypad on your keyboard so just the basic numbers on top of all of the letters and we want the alpha 1 and not the alpha zero because that's just standard for Shooters uh so remember that uh okay so let's close the those off and open up some bracket Keys whoops I'm making a lot of tyos but I can't see the keyboard because of the huge microphone shuft in my face so uh sorry about that but we'll continue on so if we press the one key we want the current weapon to be equal to zero and we want the select weapon to be called with the current weapon variable else we will only change the number and not call the function to actually change the weapons and uh remember you have to create as many of these if statements as the maximum number of weapons you want so if you want three weapons uh to be the max you'll have to uh change these if statements uh so create uh if statements for that number so if input. get key down get key down there key code do alpha 2 close it off then we want the current weapon equal to be equal to one and we again want to uh call the select weapon with the current weapon also and now you can just go ahead and duplicate this down below adjust it to so it fits this should be Alpha 3 and this should be two and now we should be good to go so let's go inside of unity and see if this is working so I hit play and when I hit the uh when I hit the two key it changes to one when I hit the three key it changes to two and when I hit one it changes back to zero and I can again still adjust this using the scroll reel which is what I'm doing now and so you can really get some nice results and uh have the player use the method he wants okay awesome so now we want to actually call the uh weapon switching uh stuff but uh I can see that this is turning out to be quite a long video so I'm going to cut it up uh off here and uh we'll take care of that in the next video so uh I hope hope you guys enjoyed it I know this was quite difficult stuff uh but I'm sure you will understand as we go forward so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
