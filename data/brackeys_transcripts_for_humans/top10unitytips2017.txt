00:00 - hello everyone here are my top 10 Unity
00:01 - quick tips they all tricks that I
00:03 - personally use and love do know that the
00:05 - list here is in no particular order all
00:06 - right so let's jump into it number one
00:09 - ending the editor while in play mode now
00:11 - most of you probably know just how
00:12 - annoying it is to make some changes to a
00:14 - game that you're really happy with only
00:15 - to realize that you were in play mode
00:17 - the entire time and so your progress was
00:19 - lost well that time has come to an end
00:21 - if you select edit preferences and then
00:24 - color you can adjust the play mode tint
00:26 - this makes the editor change color when
00:27 - you play the game so you almost can't
00:29 - help but notice number two snapping to
00:32 - the grid a lot of people don't know that
00:33 - you can snap objects to the grid if you
00:35 - hold down control while dragging on an
00:37 - object in fact you can also get a bunch
00:38 - of extra control by going edit snap
00:40 - settings here you can change the size of
00:42 - the Grid on the different axes and even
00:44 - quickly snap the selected objects into
00:46 - position number three locking the
00:48 - inspector if you need to select
00:49 - something but you don't want your
00:50 - inspector to change way from what you're
00:52 - currently viewing locking the inspector
00:54 - can be really handy this is especially
00:56 - useful when adding multiple objects to
00:58 - an array because it allows you to simply
01:00 - select them and add them all at once
01:02 - number four debug mode now it's good
01:04 - practice to Mark variables that are only
01:06 - accessed within the same class as
01:08 - private however this can be annoying
01:10 - when debugging because we can't visibly
01:11 - see the values of private variables in
01:13 - the inspector of course we can always
01:15 - insert some debug.log statements or
01:17 - change the variables to be public but
01:18 - much easier is just setting the
01:20 - inspector to debug mode and all of the
01:22 - sudden your private variables become
01:23 - visible number five align with view when
01:27 - you're setting up your camera for an as
01:28 - shot using the unity move move and
01:30 - rotate tools can feel really clumsy a
01:32 - much easier way is to find a good camera
01:34 - angle in the scene view then select your
01:36 - camera and press control shift F this
01:38 - will take the position and rotation of
01:40 - your scam View and paste it onto the
01:41 - camera transform you can also go to game
01:43 - object and click align with view number
01:46 - six range you can use the range
01:48 - attribute before a variable to give it a
01:49 - minimum and maximum value this will draw
01:51 - a slider in the unity inspector for easy
01:53 - tweaking number seven saving changes in
01:56 - play mode so if you're playing a game
01:57 - and adjusting some settings on a
01:59 - component you need to make sure that
02:00 - these changes aren't lost when you stop
02:02 - playing to do this you can right click
02:03 - the component select copy component then
02:06 - when you stop playing simply right click
02:07 - on the component once more and hit paste
02:09 - component values this one sure can be a
02:11 - lifesaver number eight spaces and
02:14 - headers if you're making a large script
02:15 - with a lot of public variables you can
02:17 - help organize them by inserting
02:19 - attributes space will create a gap
02:21 - between your variables and header allows
02:22 - you to write a title number nine hide an
02:25 - inspector staying on the subject of
02:27 - being organized you can always hide a
02:28 - variable by marking it with the hideen
02:30 - inspector attribute number 10 serialized
02:33 - field not all variables that you want to
02:35 - set in the inspector should be public in
02:37 - fact there's no reason to make a
02:38 - variable public unless it needs to be
02:40 - accessed from another class instead
02:42 - create a private variable and Mark it
02:44 - with civilized field this will make the
02:45 - variable show up in the inspector while
02:47 - still being private so that was pretty
02:49 - much it for this video if you liked it
02:50 - and want to see more definitely let me
02:52 - know also if you have any handy Unity
02:54 - tips make sure to share them in the
02:55 - comments down below and I might include
02:57 - them in a future video so thanks for
02:59 - watching and I will will'll see you in
