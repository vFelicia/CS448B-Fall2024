00:30 - it was a bit too much to squeeze into
00:31 - just one video will also be slowing down
00:34 - enemies whenever they're hit so that
00:36 - will allow for more interesting gameplay
00:38 - mechanics and give the user more
00:40 - abilities to create interesting uh kind
00:42 - of defensive setups so that is what
00:44 - we're going to be doing today and
00:46 - without further Ado let's just jump
00:47 - right into it so as you can see I'm here
00:49 - in unity and I really want to begin with
00:51 - just importing the model so let's U
00:53 - minimize Unity here and head on over and
00:55 - open the Tower Defense ass itss pack and
00:58 - you can of course download this for free
00:59 - free and there's a link for that in the
01:01 - description so let's just um let's jump
01:03 - right into our models folder under our
01:06 - laser Beamer and you can see that's both
01:09 - a blend file here in case you have blend
01:11 - installed and if you do not we'll just
01:13 - use the fbx as we have done the other
01:15 - times so let's just use that one and
01:18 - drag it into Unity but before we do that
01:20 - let's create a folder here under our
01:23 - Imports and let's call that laser Beamer
01:27 - just to stay nicely organized we can
01:30 - drag the fpx in there instead and you
01:32 - will of course see that it creates a
01:35 - laser Beamer object which we will put a
01:38 - scale factor of 0. five on and hit apply
01:41 - and then we have a a materials folder uh
01:44 - with all of the different materials that
01:45 - will just be modifying a tiny bit here
01:47 - in a second so now let's take our laser
01:49 - Beamer and drag it into the scene and
01:52 - let's reset the transform if it isn't
01:53 - already and hit F to focus in on that
01:57 - I'll Just sh shift it back to
01:58 - perspective view there and let's have a
02:00 - look in the scam view here how it looks
02:02 - in game and I think it looks just fine
02:05 - however there are some things here that
02:06 - we need to tweak so the first thing is
02:09 - that uh we want this to be in one word
02:12 - uh that's just a preference of mine
02:14 - whenever uh dealing with our stuff
02:17 - inside of unity and then I want to
02:18 - rename these things here so this one
02:20 - here is the base that is what we called
02:22 - the other ones and this is going to be
02:24 - the head awesome then we can change the
02:27 - materials for uh to make this look a bit
02:30 - better so let's find our bolts here I
02:32 - actually want them to be black you can
02:34 - of course choose whatever you want here
02:37 - and I'm going to bump up the metallic on
02:39 - those and bump down the smoothness a bit
02:42 - uh there we go actually make them a bit
02:44 - darker a bit more metallic I guess that
02:47 - will actually dark in them and then we
02:49 - can take the base here because I think
02:52 - um and that is the stand here let's
02:54 - rename that to base as well so we don't
02:57 - get confused and I think this is a bit
02:59 - to Blue so let's actually make it more
03:02 - over in the gray area here a bit more
03:05 - metallic uh take down the smoothness
03:07 - just a tad and maybe even lighten it up
03:10 - a bit here so something like that is a
03:12 - lot better because I wanted to kind of
03:15 - get be in line with the other um turret
03:18 - stance so that's fine I I do want it to
03:21 - be a tiny bit more blue then we can take
03:23 - our main turret which is this part up
03:25 - here and I actually really like this the
03:28 - feel of this I just want it to be more
03:29 - metallic which means that it will be
03:31 - darkened and therefore we have to
03:33 - brighten it up in our color and then I
03:36 - think we can maybe take our smoothness
03:37 - and just dial that down just a tad and I
03:41 - really like the feel of this and then we
03:43 - can find our um third accent here which
03:48 - is this yellow color and we can
03:50 - definitely go with yellow but I think we
03:52 - just need to dial it down just a tiny
03:54 - bit um for this to look a bit better
03:57 - something like that and it's just small
04:00 - tweaks here and if finally we have the
04:02 - pipe I think we can make that pop even
04:04 - more so let's just give that even more
04:06 - of a purple color a tiny bit of metallic
04:09 - and then definitely bump down the
04:11 - smoothness here and I think that looks
04:13 - pretty cool definitely looks laery maybe
04:16 - even toxic so that's fine and um what we
04:19 - can do now is just uh actually apply our
04:22 - turret script so that's apply our turret
04:24 - here and uh we'll give this a range of
04:27 - say 20 and won't miss with the fire rate
04:30 - that's not going to matter because we're
04:32 - going to be creating our own little
04:33 - system for dealing with um lasers
04:36 - because they are kind of an ongoing
04:38 - thing um and uh we have the enemy tag
04:41 - we'll just leave that and then we need
04:42 - to add a part to rotate so that's just
04:45 - right click create a new M2 object and
04:47 - reset that and call this one our part to
04:50 - rotate and let's drag this under our
04:53 - head and then reset the transform to
04:56 - that drag it out again and that will
04:58 - just Center it kind of where it needs to
05:00 - be which is here and now of course we
05:02 - need to have our blue Z Arrow uh point
05:06 - in the direction of our head so we've
05:08 - done this multiple times and we're just
05:09 - making sure that when we rotate this uh
05:12 - it will actually align with the z-axis
05:14 - being forward uh so that we don't have
05:17 - to do any messing around with any
05:19 - rotations inside of the script we just
05:21 - do that in here which is much more
05:23 - visual so make sure it says pivot pivot
05:26 - and local up here and then we can maybe
05:29 - ser the X on the X and um zero the
05:33 - coordinate on the X and then uh um put a
05:37 - 90 that will have to be ative 90 on the
05:40 - Y and let's also put a 1 one one scale I
05:45 - think that's going to be better and then
05:47 - we can take our head here and drag that
05:49 - under the pot to rotate and we can just
05:51 - hit continue here and now we should be
05:53 - see that our part to rotate points in
05:55 - the correct direction and we can just
05:57 - easily move this part around
06:00 - awesome so now we can reference that in
06:02 - here as well so let's drag our pot to
06:04 - rotate into the PO to rotate field and
06:07 - finally we need a bullet prefab except
06:09 - we're not going to be using bullets so
06:11 - we'll ignore that as well however we do
06:13 - want a fire Point um so we'll have some
06:17 - place where our laser will origin so uh
06:20 - and we are just going to create that as
06:22 - we've always done on the part to rotate
06:25 - rotate so let's create an empty there
06:27 - again reset it and we'll name this our
06:31 - fire
06:32 - point and we will um make sure again to
06:36 - uh position this correctly so let's view
06:38 - it from this side switch to isometric
06:41 - View and we can just drag that up there
06:45 - and I wanted it to be pretty close now
06:46 - because we're not actually instantiating
06:48 - anything here we're just um kind of
06:51 - putting a point for the line renderer so
06:53 - we can get really close and um it's
06:56 - actually centered from the front here I
06:58 - believe already that's
07:00 - awesome yeah great cool so now we can
07:04 - drag this in select the line uh the
07:06 - laser Beamer and drag the fireo onto the
07:09 - correct slot and there we go so I
07:11 - believe that was all we needed to set up
07:14 - on on this object so far uh so let's
07:17 - actually go ahead and turn this into a
07:19 - prefab now so let's go into prefabs and
07:21 - drag that in there the entire laser
07:24 - Beamer and we'll just have it sit here
07:27 - for a moment so that we can easily
07:29 - change things if we want to so the next
07:32 - thing is kind of adding this to our
07:34 - build menu so that we can actually put
07:36 - it in the game as the game is running so
07:39 - uh to do this again we find our overlay
07:41 - canvas under shop and then we see that
07:44 - we have a stand a turret and a missile
07:46 - launcher item and apple really wants me
07:49 - to spend money these days so I'll just
07:50 - dismiss that the only thing that's
07:52 - running out is my patience there there
07:55 - we go um so I'll um duplicate our
07:58 - missile launcher item here here and I
08:00 - will call this one um laser Beamer and
08:05 - we'll actually do laser Beamer
08:07 - item and we need to change the icon and
08:10 - we'll do that in just a second but let's
08:12 - also change the cost text down here and
08:15 - I'll change that to say
08:17 - $350 to make it very expensive uh which
08:20 - means we'll have to make it powerful as
08:22 - well and uh we need to go into the shop
08:25 - and change this function here and I
08:27 - believe we can just go ahead and do that
08:28 - right now now so let's double click on
08:30 - the shop to be taken over here and let's
08:32 - double click that to open it up in
08:34 - visual studio and all we need to do here
08:36 - is First add a new turret blueprint so
08:38 - we'll go public turret blueprint and
08:41 - this is going to be our uh laser
08:45 - Beamer and we'll add a new function for
08:48 - this as well so we'll uh call this one
08:51 - the select laser Beamer and it's going
08:55 - to say laser Beamer
08:58 - selected there we go and we are going to
09:01 - select the tur to build and we're going
09:03 - to pass in our laser Beamer of course
09:06 - awesome and one thing that I actually
09:08 - noticed is that under our build manager
09:11 - um if we go to our game master and find
09:13 - our build manager here you can see that
09:16 - we still have a standard turret and a
09:17 - missile launcher prefab referenced but
09:19 - we're not using those in any way so
09:21 - let's just double click on that and go
09:23 - in here and remove those two Fields
09:26 - there's really no reason for those to
09:28 - sit there because we are passing them
09:29 - along um inside of the turd
09:32 - blueprint so we can just remove those
09:35 - and you can see that we should still be
09:36 - error free down here awesome um so now
09:41 - that we've added those we can find our
09:43 - shop and we can find our laser Beamer
09:45 - and we can set this up so let's set the
09:47 - cost to 350 and let's also find our
09:50 - prefab and drag that in
09:53 - there
09:55 - cool so I believe that was kind of all
09:57 - we needed to set up in terms of the shop
10:00 - here except of course we need to add an
10:03 - icon so uh let's have a look at
10:05 - importing one of those and again I
10:08 - inside of the um inside of the Tower
10:11 - Defense assets pack I have a Sprites
10:13 - folder and I've included a laser Beamer
10:16 - icon.png there's also Photoshop file if
10:19 - you use Photoshop again I'm just going
10:21 - to import the PNG here and let's find
10:24 - our um icons folder and let's drag that
10:28 - right in there
10:29 - I believe the other ones we imported
10:31 - were uh PNG as well let me just check
10:35 - for that because I like to use the same
10:37 - actually the first one was a Photoshop
10:39 - we'll just do a PNG here it really
10:41 - doesn't matter on my system uh so you
10:44 - can see here uh that the texture type is
10:46 - currently set to texture we need to
10:47 - change that to 2D and UI and uh the
10:50 - Sorting here or the uh Alpha channel
10:53 - should be sorted out and I believe
10:56 - that's all we need to change except we
10:57 - can maybe uh change this to 512 if we
11:00 - have OCD and then we can uh make this
11:03 - true color um there we go just to make
11:06 - it display really beautifully and then
11:08 - we can change that inside of the missile
11:10 - laundry icon here change that to the
11:12 - laser Beamer so you can see that set up
11:14 - inside of the unity scene and I actually
11:16 - think that looks fairly
11:19 - decent good okay things are moving along
11:23 - I actually want to maybe make it a tiny
11:25 - bit bigger um I actually want to make it
11:28 - maybe one 20 down here I think that's
11:32 - better uh and that looks really really
11:34 - cool so now we should be able to just
11:36 - hit play and select the laser Beamer and
11:39 - it should say um whoops there's
11:41 - something here we haven't assigned oh
11:43 - that's on our laser Beamer we haven't
11:45 - assigned a bullet preab for now just
11:46 - while testing we'll go in here and just
11:49 - assign a normal bullet one we'll just do
11:51 - a um bullet there we go just so we won't
11:53 - get any errors so we can select here our
11:57 - missile or it says missile launcher so
11:58 - selected that's because we have to find
12:01 - our laser Beamer uh item that we go into
12:04 - the shop and we have to change the on
12:06 - click event so we've actually added the
12:08 - function but we haven't changed this
12:09 - event so it still points to the select
12:11 - missile launcher function so we just
12:13 - need to go on shop and change that to
12:16 - select laser Beamer and we should be all
12:18 - right so let's try and H and play now
12:20 - clicking there laser Beamer selected and
12:22 - clicking somewhere in the scene and you
12:24 - can see it appears and we can only
12:26 - purchase one because we actually don't
12:28 - have that much money when starting
12:30 - out cool uh so now I think it's time to
12:37 - add in a line render to do some actual
12:40 - lasering laser ring laser thing so let's
12:44 - do that so let's uh create a we could
12:47 - either actually put it just in here or
12:50 - we could put it as a separate object I
12:53 - think we're just going to put it on the
12:56 - road but you can do any anything you
12:59 - want so let's just put it here and um
13:03 - we're not going to be casting Shadows
13:05 - we're not going to be receiving Shadows
13:07 - um motion vectors will just leave on
13:10 - we'll have one material which we'll
13:11 - specify in a moment and let's just set
13:13 - up some temporary positions here that
13:15 - will allow us to view what this looks
13:17 - like so let's put a y value of three and
13:20 - a y value of three down here and then a
13:22 - z value of maybe five just so we can see
13:25 - kind of what is going on actually we
13:28 - could put it out here but I think this
13:30 - is going to be fine good so this is what
13:32 - our line currently looks like not too
13:35 - awesome so let's go to excuse me I think
13:38 - I'll have to take a sip of water
13:42 - here that's better all right so let's go
13:45 - under our parameters and let's uh put
13:47 - our start width
13:49 - to3 and our end width to3 as
13:53 - well cool that is definitely better and
13:57 - then we can uh go inside of our know our
13:59 - positions are fine we can go and find an
14:01 - actual material for this so let's create
14:03 - a new one inside the materials folder
14:05 - let's create a new material and let's
14:08 - call this one laser and let's then go
14:11 - back to our laser Beamer and drag the
14:13 - laser in there and we can go down here
14:16 - change the Shader to something like
14:19 - unlit color maybe or you could go
14:22 - particles uh Alpha
14:24 - Blended actually I think I'm going to go
14:27 - Alpha Blended and um you can see that we
14:30 - can mess around with the color in here
14:32 - so that's what we're going to be doing
14:33 - so let's take our start color here and
14:35 - change that to some kind of orangey
14:38 - thing and let's take our end color
14:41 - actually I want to switch that around um
14:44 - this one needs to
14:45 - be a bit actually let's do the first one
14:48 - red and the other one yeah let's do that
14:51 - so this one will be kind of bright
14:53 - almost yellow and this one is going to
14:55 - be kind of red to give that cool looking
14:59 - effect there and um we can maybe make
15:02 - the first one here a bit transparent as
15:04 - well and this is where I want to go in
15:07 - on to our material and bump this up a
15:09 - bit and also bump this up a bit
15:12 - something like that looks a bit better
15:15 - and there we go actually think that
15:18 - looks kind of nice I'm looking inside of
15:20 - the game view here uh just to get an
15:23 - idea of of how that looks and you can
15:26 - definitely go ahead and add more effects
15:28 - around this one thing that I do
15:29 - recommend is that uh you at the tip of
15:32 - the laser add some kind of particle
15:34 - system that you toggle on and off um in
15:37 - order to uh give a cool uh impression
15:41 - that uh the lace is actually hitting the
15:43 - object and there's Sparks bouncing off
15:45 - and stuff like that is that if that's
15:47 - something you really want to see me do
15:50 - leave that in the comment and I'll
15:51 - include it in the next video for slowing
15:54 - down the enemies and stuff like that
15:55 - then we'll just go particle crazy which
15:57 - you know I love it's not really not that
15:59 - I don't want to do it so please leave a
16:02 - comment okay so we'll continue the video
16:04 - here um so we've set up these parameters
16:07 - and U we're actually ready to go ahead
16:10 - and make this interactive through the
16:12 - script so let's apply this and don't
16:15 - worry about this being uh looking weird
16:17 - like this we can just delete our laser
16:19 - Beamer should be totally fine and then
16:22 - we can um find the scripts called turret
16:28 - there we go so let's double click our
16:29 - tet script and we'll move things around
16:31 - a bit here uh to organize them for what
16:34 - we want to do so currently we have these
16:36 - attributes I want to call this General
16:38 - and I pretty much only want our range to
16:40 - be in here because the next thing that I
16:42 - want to do is have one
16:44 - called um use bullets and this is going
16:49 - to be the
16:50 - default and in here we have stuff for
16:52 - bullets we have the fire rate the fire
16:54 - countdown we also have the bullet prefab
16:59 - awesome so we'll just put all of those
17:01 - in there and then we'll create a new
17:04 - header down
17:06 - here which is going to be um use of
17:09 - course
17:12 - laser and we'll remove the default there
17:15 - and to include the laser what we'll do
17:17 - is we'll have a Boolean that on the um
17:21 - that we can check inside of the editor
17:23 - if we want the attor to use a laser
17:25 - instead so we'll just do a public bll
17:28 - use laser and we'll set that equal to
17:32 - false by default awesome and then in
17:36 - here we can also have other stuff like a
17:38 - reference to a line renderer so let's do
17:39 - a public line renderer and we'll just do
17:43 - line renderer by the way in case you
17:45 - missed on the recent brei live stream
17:47 - it's currently um on the YouTube channel
17:50 - as a reupload so you can check that out
17:52 - we recreated uh the curve Fever The
17:54 - Snake like game and um in there we do a
17:57 - lot of stuff up with the line renderer
17:59 - and we do that in unity 5.5 which is
18:02 - currently in public beta but will
18:04 - probably soon be released uh for real um
18:07 - and uh there's so much new stuff done to
18:10 - the line render it looks so much better
18:12 - so if you think this is looking kind of
18:14 - not that great uh go check that out and
18:18 - um play around with the features there
18:19 - there's so much stuff to make it look a
18:21 - lot better uh and especially with
18:24 - particles as well so that's a lot of fun
18:26 - and you can check that out just wanted
18:27 - to mention that
18:28 - so uh we have the public line renderer
18:30 - here and uh let's actually put this to
18:33 - use and just to give you an idea of what
18:35 - we just did uh let me just find our
18:39 - prefabs and then find our laser Beamer
18:41 - here and you can see that this is now
18:43 - much more nicely grouped and we'll just
18:45 - for the laser Beamer here we'll have to
18:47 - check you use laser and we'll drag our
18:50 - line renderer right in there so if it's
18:52 - sitting on another object you can just
18:54 - drag in that object and it will uh uh
18:56 - select the line renderer for you so so
18:58 - that should take care of all of that and
19:01 - we can just remove the bullet prefab
19:03 - here not that it matters uh it's just
19:05 - not the one that we're
19:07 - using cool by the way I will just throw
19:10 - in one more point before continuing if
19:11 - you want to set this up even more nicely
19:14 - so that you have a variable called uh
19:16 - use bullets or maybe even an enumerator
19:19 - to select either bullets or laser and
19:22 - then it will show felds depending on
19:24 - what you've selected then I really
19:26 - suggest um creating an script and unity
19:29 - is so easily extendable with those um
19:31 - it's just too much for this video uh
19:33 - that simply switches between displaying
19:36 - those um that's super easy to do and you
19:38 - can just look up Unity custom editor
19:42 - good so that was all um so now we can
19:45 - continue so let's find the place here
19:47 - where uh we update stuff so in here we
19:50 - check if our Target is equal to null and
19:53 - if it isn't meaning that we have a
19:54 - Target we log on to it and then we
19:57 - handle some shooting so let's take all
19:59 - of this log on code and move into a
20:01 - separate function we should have done
20:02 - this a long time ago so let's uh call
20:05 - this one lock on
20:09 - Target uh and we'll move that down here
20:14 - so void log On
20:18 - Target and we'll just paste that entire
20:21 - code Block in
20:22 - there and um then we can put an if
20:25 - statement here saying if used laser
20:30 - then we want to laser
20:32 - stuff whoops not use laser we want to
20:35 - create a new function called lace that's
20:37 - really annoying let's just create the
20:39 - function here instead of getting around
20:42 - uh visual Studios autocomplete so we'll
20:44 - have a void laser down here and now we
20:47 - should be able to Tye it type it up here
20:49 - so laser and um if not so if we're using
20:53 - bullets we can go ahead and do all of
20:55 - this fire countdown shooting stuff stuff
20:59 - awesome and you can of course put that
21:00 - into a separate function as well but
21:02 - since we already have a shoed function I
21:04 - don't really think that's
21:06 - necessary um cool so um and I can see
21:09 - that I've pressed insert there just
21:11 - needed to get rid of that so inside of
21:13 - our laser what we can now do is say line
21:16 - renderer Dot and then we can set the
21:18 - positions of the different points that
21:20 - we want a line renderer to go through so
21:22 - again if you haven't seen the live
21:23 - stream and I cover this in there there's
21:25 - a positions array here meaning um each
21:28 - of these elements here in the array is
21:31 - uh a point that our line renderer will
21:33 - go through so we can actually create
21:35 - more if you want kind of a bending laser
21:37 - if you want one that's six saacks or
21:39 - whatever you can definitely do that uh
21:41 - but for now we'll just create a symbol
21:43 - line and um we'll uh do that by simply
21:46 - setting the first element and the second
21:49 - element in the array so U we'll just do
21:51 - line render do set position and we do
21:54 - that using an index so in our case the
21:56 - first element is index. Z and giving it
21:59 - a position and that's going to be our
22:01 - own position but we want not to use that
22:03 - we want to use our fire point firepoint
22:06 - do uh transform dot actually it's it's a
22:10 - transform so we can just do firepoint
22:12 - doos and we want to set the second one
22:15 - so line renderer do set position one to
22:19 - our Target's position so target.
22:23 - position there we go so that actually
22:25 - does it for us and we should see this
22:27 - working already so if we uh we go in
22:31 - here if we hit play and place down our
22:36 - turret we can see that that works
22:39 - however you will also notice that when
22:42 - our enemy here gets out of
22:45 - range the line renderer does not
22:48 - disappear so what we have to do in order
22:51 - to get that working is just using the
22:55 - fact that up here we're checking whether
22:56 - or not we have a Target so
22:58 - let's just make this a bit bigger here
23:00 - so let's say uh if Target is equal to
23:03 - null we definitely want to return but we
23:05 - want to do some stuff before that and
23:06 - that is just
23:07 - checking um if line renderer actually
23:11 - let's first check if uh use laser is
23:14 - true so we only want to do this kind of
23:16 - stuff if we actually using a laser and
23:19 - in that case we can say if line
23:23 - renderer actually we don't even need to
23:26 - do that if statement we could could do
23:28 - that if statement uh we'll do it if line
23:31 - renderer do um
23:34 - enabled uh then we want to disable it so
23:36 - we can just do line renderer do enabled
23:40 - equals false there we go and you can of
23:44 - course put that inside the other if
23:45 - statement as well but I think this is
23:47 - easier read uh to read and then uh down
23:50 - here we can simply say that if line
23:54 - renderer do enabled and then put an
23:57 - exclamation mark so if it's not enabled
23:59 - we'll do line renderer do enabled equals
24:03 - true there we go so this way we easily
24:06 - switch it on and off and we only do it
24:08 - once even though U we are uh doing all
24:11 - of this stuff inside the update Loop so
24:13 - if we now hit play we should see that
24:15 - when we spawn this in we no longer have
24:17 - a line up here and that uh there's no
24:21 - line until we actually get a Target and
24:24 - as soon as he's out of range our line
24:26 - renderer just again disappears so um
24:29 - that is working just the way we want it
24:31 - to and um yeah again for the next video
24:34 - we'll be slowing down the opponents if
24:36 - you want me to add some damage over time
24:38 - let me know if you want me to add more
24:40 - particles or more effects let me know I
24:42 - would love to do that and um yeah so
24:44 - that's pretty much all I wanted to show
24:46 - for this video I hope you enjoyed it and
24:48 - I will see you in the next one thank you

Cleaned transcript:

this video is brought to you by Aron meta thank you so much for donating if you want to support Brees yourself you can go to patreon.com/crashcourse it was a bit too much to squeeze into just one video will also be slowing down enemies whenever they're hit so that will allow for more interesting gameplay mechanics and give the user more abilities to create interesting uh kind of defensive setups so that is what we're going to be doing today and without further Ado let's just jump right into it so as you can see I'm here in unity and I really want to begin with just importing the model so let's U minimize Unity here and head on over and open the Tower Defense ass itss pack and you can of course download this for free free and there's a link for that in the description so let's just um let's jump right into our models folder under our laser Beamer and you can see that's both a blend file here in case you have blend installed and if you do not we'll just use the fbx as we have done the other times so let's just use that one and drag it into Unity but before we do that let's create a folder here under our Imports and let's call that laser Beamer just to stay nicely organized we can drag the fpx in there instead and you will of course see that it creates a laser Beamer object which we will put a scale factor of 0. five on and hit apply and then we have a a materials folder uh with all of the different materials that will just be modifying a tiny bit here in a second so now let's take our laser Beamer and drag it into the scene and let's reset the transform if it isn't already and hit F to focus in on that I'll Just sh shift it back to perspective view there and let's have a look in the scam view here how it looks in game and I think it looks just fine however there are some things here that we need to tweak so the first thing is that uh we want this to be in one word uh that's just a preference of mine whenever uh dealing with our stuff inside of unity and then I want to rename these things here so this one here is the base that is what we called the other ones and this is going to be the head awesome then we can change the materials for uh to make this look a bit better so let's find our bolts here I actually want them to be black you can of course choose whatever you want here and I'm going to bump up the metallic on those and bump down the smoothness a bit uh there we go actually make them a bit darker a bit more metallic I guess that will actually dark in them and then we can take the base here because I think um and that is the stand here let's rename that to base as well so we don't get confused and I think this is a bit to Blue so let's actually make it more over in the gray area here a bit more metallic uh take down the smoothness just a tad and maybe even lighten it up a bit here so something like that is a lot better because I wanted to kind of get be in line with the other um turret stance so that's fine I I do want it to be a tiny bit more blue then we can take our main turret which is this part up here and I actually really like this the feel of this I just want it to be more metallic which means that it will be darkened and therefore we have to brighten it up in our color and then I think we can maybe take our smoothness and just dial that down just a tad and I really like the feel of this and then we can find our um third accent here which is this yellow color and we can definitely go with yellow but I think we just need to dial it down just a tiny bit um for this to look a bit better something like that and it's just small tweaks here and if finally we have the pipe I think we can make that pop even more so let's just give that even more of a purple color a tiny bit of metallic and then definitely bump down the smoothness here and I think that looks pretty cool definitely looks laery maybe even toxic so that's fine and um what we can do now is just uh actually apply our turret script so that's apply our turret here and uh we'll give this a range of say 20 and won't miss with the fire rate that's not going to matter because we're going to be creating our own little system for dealing with um lasers because they are kind of an ongoing thing um and uh we have the enemy tag we'll just leave that and then we need to add a part to rotate so that's just right click create a new M2 object and reset that and call this one our part to rotate and let's drag this under our head and then reset the transform to that drag it out again and that will just Center it kind of where it needs to be which is here and now of course we need to have our blue Z Arrow uh point in the direction of our head so we've done this multiple times and we're just making sure that when we rotate this uh it will actually align with the zaxis being forward uh so that we don't have to do any messing around with any rotations inside of the script we just do that in here which is much more visual so make sure it says pivot pivot and local up here and then we can maybe ser the X on the X and um zero the coordinate on the X and then uh um put a 90 that will have to be ative 90 on the Y and let's also put a 1 one one scale I think that's going to be better and then we can take our head here and drag that under the pot to rotate and we can just hit continue here and now we should be see that our part to rotate points in the correct direction and we can just easily move this part around awesome so now we can reference that in here as well so let's drag our pot to rotate into the PO to rotate field and finally we need a bullet prefab except we're not going to be using bullets so we'll ignore that as well however we do want a fire Point um so we'll have some place where our laser will origin so uh and we are just going to create that as we've always done on the part to rotate rotate so let's create an empty there again reset it and we'll name this our fire point and we will um make sure again to uh position this correctly so let's view it from this side switch to isometric View and we can just drag that up there and I wanted it to be pretty close now because we're not actually instantiating anything here we're just um kind of putting a point for the line renderer so we can get really close and um it's actually centered from the front here I believe already that's awesome yeah great cool so now we can drag this in select the line uh the laser Beamer and drag the fireo onto the correct slot and there we go so I believe that was all we needed to set up on on this object so far uh so let's actually go ahead and turn this into a prefab now so let's go into prefabs and drag that in there the entire laser Beamer and we'll just have it sit here for a moment so that we can easily change things if we want to so the next thing is kind of adding this to our build menu so that we can actually put it in the game as the game is running so uh to do this again we find our overlay canvas under shop and then we see that we have a stand a turret and a missile launcher item and apple really wants me to spend money these days so I'll just dismiss that the only thing that's running out is my patience there there we go um so I'll um duplicate our missile launcher item here here and I will call this one um laser Beamer and we'll actually do laser Beamer item and we need to change the icon and we'll do that in just a second but let's also change the cost text down here and I'll change that to say $350 to make it very expensive uh which means we'll have to make it powerful as well and uh we need to go into the shop and change this function here and I believe we can just go ahead and do that right now now so let's double click on the shop to be taken over here and let's double click that to open it up in visual studio and all we need to do here is First add a new turret blueprint so we'll go public turret blueprint and this is going to be our uh laser Beamer and we'll add a new function for this as well so we'll uh call this one the select laser Beamer and it's going to say laser Beamer selected there we go and we are going to select the tur to build and we're going to pass in our laser Beamer of course awesome and one thing that I actually noticed is that under our build manager um if we go to our game master and find our build manager here you can see that we still have a standard turret and a missile launcher prefab referenced but we're not using those in any way so let's just double click on that and go in here and remove those two Fields there's really no reason for those to sit there because we are passing them along um inside of the turd blueprint so we can just remove those and you can see that we should still be error free down here awesome um so now that we've added those we can find our shop and we can find our laser Beamer and we can set this up so let's set the cost to 350 and let's also find our prefab and drag that in there cool so I believe that was kind of all we needed to set up in terms of the shop here except of course we need to add an icon so uh let's have a look at importing one of those and again I inside of the um inside of the Tower Defense assets pack I have a Sprites folder and I've included a laser Beamer icon.png there's also Photoshop file if you use Photoshop again I'm just going to import the PNG here and let's find our um icons folder and let's drag that right in there I believe the other ones we imported were uh PNG as well let me just check for that because I like to use the same actually the first one was a Photoshop we'll just do a PNG here it really doesn't matter on my system uh so you can see here uh that the texture type is currently set to texture we need to change that to 2D and UI and uh the Sorting here or the uh Alpha channel should be sorted out and I believe that's all we need to change except we can maybe uh change this to 512 if we have OCD and then we can uh make this true color um there we go just to make it display really beautifully and then we can change that inside of the missile laundry icon here change that to the laser Beamer so you can see that set up inside of the unity scene and I actually think that looks fairly decent good okay things are moving along I actually want to maybe make it a tiny bit bigger um I actually want to make it maybe one 20 down here I think that's better uh and that looks really really cool so now we should be able to just hit play and select the laser Beamer and it should say um whoops there's something here we haven't assigned oh that's on our laser Beamer we haven't assigned a bullet preab for now just while testing we'll go in here and just assign a normal bullet one we'll just do a um bullet there we go just so we won't get any errors so we can select here our missile or it says missile launcher so selected that's because we have to find our laser Beamer uh item that we go into the shop and we have to change the on click event so we've actually added the function but we haven't changed this event so it still points to the select missile launcher function so we just need to go on shop and change that to select laser Beamer and we should be all right so let's try and H and play now clicking there laser Beamer selected and clicking somewhere in the scene and you can see it appears and we can only purchase one because we actually don't have that much money when starting out cool uh so now I think it's time to add in a line render to do some actual lasering laser ring laser thing so let's do that so let's uh create a we could either actually put it just in here or we could put it as a separate object I think we're just going to put it on the road but you can do any anything you want so let's just put it here and um we're not going to be casting Shadows we're not going to be receiving Shadows um motion vectors will just leave on we'll have one material which we'll specify in a moment and let's just set up some temporary positions here that will allow us to view what this looks like so let's put a y value of three and a y value of three down here and then a z value of maybe five just so we can see kind of what is going on actually we could put it out here but I think this is going to be fine good so this is what our line currently looks like not too awesome so let's go to excuse me I think I'll have to take a sip of water here that's better all right so let's go under our parameters and let's uh put our start width to3 and our end width to3 as well cool that is definitely better and then we can uh go inside of our know our positions are fine we can go and find an actual material for this so let's create a new one inside the materials folder let's create a new material and let's call this one laser and let's then go back to our laser Beamer and drag the laser in there and we can go down here change the Shader to something like unlit color maybe or you could go particles uh Alpha Blended actually I think I'm going to go Alpha Blended and um you can see that we can mess around with the color in here so that's what we're going to be doing so let's take our start color here and change that to some kind of orangey thing and let's take our end color actually I want to switch that around um this one needs to be a bit actually let's do the first one red and the other one yeah let's do that so this one will be kind of bright almost yellow and this one is going to be kind of red to give that cool looking effect there and um we can maybe make the first one here a bit transparent as well and this is where I want to go in on to our material and bump this up a bit and also bump this up a bit something like that looks a bit better and there we go actually think that looks kind of nice I'm looking inside of the game view here uh just to get an idea of of how that looks and you can definitely go ahead and add more effects around this one thing that I do recommend is that uh you at the tip of the laser add some kind of particle system that you toggle on and off um in order to uh give a cool uh impression that uh the lace is actually hitting the object and there's Sparks bouncing off and stuff like that is that if that's something you really want to see me do leave that in the comment and I'll include it in the next video for slowing down the enemies and stuff like that then we'll just go particle crazy which you know I love it's not really not that I don't want to do it so please leave a comment okay so we'll continue the video here um so we've set up these parameters and U we're actually ready to go ahead and make this interactive through the script so let's apply this and don't worry about this being uh looking weird like this we can just delete our laser Beamer should be totally fine and then we can um find the scripts called turret there we go so let's double click our tet script and we'll move things around a bit here uh to organize them for what we want to do so currently we have these attributes I want to call this General and I pretty much only want our range to be in here because the next thing that I want to do is have one called um use bullets and this is going to be the default and in here we have stuff for bullets we have the fire rate the fire countdown we also have the bullet prefab awesome so we'll just put all of those in there and then we'll create a new header down here which is going to be um use of course laser and we'll remove the default there and to include the laser what we'll do is we'll have a Boolean that on the um that we can check inside of the editor if we want the attor to use a laser instead so we'll just do a public bll use laser and we'll set that equal to false by default awesome and then in here we can also have other stuff like a reference to a line renderer so let's do a public line renderer and we'll just do line renderer by the way in case you missed on the recent brei live stream it's currently um on the YouTube channel as a reupload so you can check that out we recreated uh the curve Fever The Snake like game and um in there we do a lot of stuff up with the line renderer and we do that in unity 5.5 which is currently in public beta but will probably soon be released uh for real um and uh there's so much new stuff done to the line render it looks so much better so if you think this is looking kind of not that great uh go check that out and um play around with the features there there's so much stuff to make it look a lot better uh and especially with particles as well so that's a lot of fun and you can check that out just wanted to mention that so uh we have the public line renderer here and uh let's actually put this to use and just to give you an idea of what we just did uh let me just find our prefabs and then find our laser Beamer here and you can see that this is now much more nicely grouped and we'll just for the laser Beamer here we'll have to check you use laser and we'll drag our line renderer right in there so if it's sitting on another object you can just drag in that object and it will uh uh select the line renderer for you so so that should take care of all of that and we can just remove the bullet prefab here not that it matters uh it's just not the one that we're using cool by the way I will just throw in one more point before continuing if you want to set this up even more nicely so that you have a variable called uh use bullets or maybe even an enumerator to select either bullets or laser and then it will show felds depending on what you've selected then I really suggest um creating an script and unity is so easily extendable with those um it's just too much for this video uh that simply switches between displaying those um that's super easy to do and you can just look up Unity custom editor good so that was all um so now we can continue so let's find the place here where uh we update stuff so in here we check if our Target is equal to null and if it isn't meaning that we have a Target we log on to it and then we handle some shooting so let's take all of this log on code and move into a separate function we should have done this a long time ago so let's uh call this one lock on Target uh and we'll move that down here so void log On Target and we'll just paste that entire code Block in there and um then we can put an if statement here saying if used laser then we want to laser stuff whoops not use laser we want to create a new function called lace that's really annoying let's just create the function here instead of getting around uh visual Studios autocomplete so we'll have a void laser down here and now we should be able to Tye it type it up here so laser and um if not so if we're using bullets we can go ahead and do all of this fire countdown shooting stuff stuff awesome and you can of course put that into a separate function as well but since we already have a shoed function I don't really think that's necessary um cool so um and I can see that I've pressed insert there just needed to get rid of that so inside of our laser what we can now do is say line renderer Dot and then we can set the positions of the different points that we want a line renderer to go through so again if you haven't seen the live stream and I cover this in there there's a positions array here meaning um each of these elements here in the array is uh a point that our line renderer will go through so we can actually create more if you want kind of a bending laser if you want one that's six saacks or whatever you can definitely do that uh but for now we'll just create a symbol line and um we'll uh do that by simply setting the first element and the second element in the array so U we'll just do line render do set position and we do that using an index so in our case the first element is index. Z and giving it a position and that's going to be our own position but we want not to use that we want to use our fire point firepoint do uh transform dot actually it's it's a transform so we can just do firepoint doos and we want to set the second one so line renderer do set position one to our Target's position so target. position there we go so that actually does it for us and we should see this working already so if we uh we go in here if we hit play and place down our turret we can see that that works however you will also notice that when our enemy here gets out of range the line renderer does not disappear so what we have to do in order to get that working is just using the fact that up here we're checking whether or not we have a Target so let's just make this a bit bigger here so let's say uh if Target is equal to null we definitely want to return but we want to do some stuff before that and that is just checking um if line renderer actually let's first check if uh use laser is true so we only want to do this kind of stuff if we actually using a laser and in that case we can say if line renderer actually we don't even need to do that if statement we could could do that if statement uh we'll do it if line renderer do um enabled uh then we want to disable it so we can just do line renderer do enabled equals false there we go and you can of course put that inside the other if statement as well but I think this is easier read uh to read and then uh down here we can simply say that if line renderer do enabled and then put an exclamation mark so if it's not enabled we'll do line renderer do enabled equals true there we go so this way we easily switch it on and off and we only do it once even though U we are uh doing all of this stuff inside the update Loop so if we now hit play we should see that when we spawn this in we no longer have a line up here and that uh there's no line until we actually get a Target and as soon as he's out of range our line renderer just again disappears so um that is working just the way we want it to and um yeah again for the next video we'll be slowing down the opponents if you want me to add some damage over time let me know if you want me to add more particles or more effects let me know I would love to do that and um yeah so that's pretty much all I wanted to show for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next one thank you so much to all of the awesome people who donated in September and a special thanks to Aon meta Robert R James Kell Hound Kim Goos B andang and vixi and P thank you so much for donating you guys are awesome if you want to support breus yourself you can go to patreon.com breis
