00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:06 - fading between scenes in unity today
00:08 - we're going to be taking a look at
00:10 - making a script that will allow us to
00:13 - fade out change level and then fade back
00:15 - in with just a couple of lines of code
00:18 - that we can place anywhere in our game
00:21 - so first off I'm going to select uh an
00:23 - object this could be any object I'm just
00:25 - going to use the GM object and then I'm
00:27 - going to create a new script here let's
00:30 - call this fading it's going to be of
00:32 - type
00:34 - c so double click it to open it up in
00:36 - mono develop and let's start out by
00:39 - adding some variables I excuse the
00:41 - quality of the recording it's not as
00:43 - good as it as it normally is uh but
00:45 - we're going to change that uh in the
00:47 - next video don't worry so the first
00:49 - variable is a texture 2D we're going to
00:51 - call it Fade Out texture and this is
00:53 - just the image that will overlay the
00:55 - screen in our case it's just going to be
00:58 - black the next variable is a public
01:00 - float with the fade speed this is of
01:04 - course the speed we will fade in and out
01:08 - at then we're going to make a private
01:11 - integer called Draw depth and we're
01:14 - going to set this to minus a th000 this
01:17 - is the textures um draw order in the
01:20 - hierarchy meaning that it will be drawn
01:23 - last and therefore it will render on top
01:26 - so we're just making sure that the black
01:28 - image we are going to fade in and out is
01:30 - going to be on top of everything else
01:33 - then we make a private float with the
01:34 - alpha and we just set this uh as with a
01:37 - default to one so it's going to start
01:40 - out by being completely
01:42 - visible then we make a private in called
01:46 - fade Direction and we equal uh or we
01:49 - default this to minus
01:51 - one this is the direction to fade if
01:55 - it's equal to minus one it will fade in
01:58 - and if it's equal to 1 it will fade
02:02 - out let's just go ahead and uh delete
02:05 - the two functions here and make a new
02:07 - one called on GUI and this is going to
02:11 - be uh good for rendering different kinds
02:13 - of Graphics um so this is unity's
02:16 - function for rendering
02:19 - guy and uh then first we're going to
02:22 - fade in and out the alpha value using a
02:25 - direction a speed and time. Delta time
02:28 - which will convert the operation to
02:30 - seconds so we do this by setting saying
02:34 - Alpha plus equals fate Direction time
02:38 - fade speed times time. Delta
02:43 - time next
02:44 - up we force uh or what is called clamp
02:49 - the uh value to be between zero and one
02:53 - this is because that the guy. color uses
02:57 - a alpha value between zero and
03:01 - 1 so
03:05 - Alpha
03:07 - equals math. clamp one because that will
03:12 - clamp it between zero and one and then
03:14 - we input the
03:16 - alpha next up let's set the color of a
03:19 - DUI in this case our texture or the
03:22 - black image and uh we really want the
03:25 - color values to just stay the same the
03:28 - only value we want to change just the
03:30 - alpha and this is included in the dui.
03:40 - color so do dui. color equals new
03:47 - color and inside of this we're going to
03:49 - pass it the GUI color. R for red gu
03:53 - color G uhg for green andb for blue and
03:58 - then we're going to type in the the
03:59 - alpha at
04:04 - last so here we are setting the
04:07 - alpha next up we're going to dui. depth
04:11 - and we're going to equal this to our
04:13 - draw
04:18 - depth so here we are making sure that
04:21 - the black texture will render on
04:28 - top then we're saying GUI draw. draw
04:32 - texture and inside of this we are going
04:34 - to type new rect which is four values
04:40 - and inside of this rectangle we going to
04:42 - do 0 comma 0 screen do width comma
04:47 - screen do height so that means it will
04:50 - fill the whole screen it will take the 0
04:52 - comma 0 point which is the top left
04:55 - corner and it will extend to the width
04:57 - and the height using the fade out
04:59 - texture meaning that we will overlay the
05:02 - Fade Out texture on the entire
05:08 - screen so now we've actually written all
05:11 - the logic we need in order for the image
05:14 - to fade smoothly in and out now we just
05:17 - need some functions that will set the
05:19 - direction to fade in and we're going to
05:22 - make these available from other scripts
05:25 - also so here we're going to set the fade
05:28 - direction to the the direction parameter
05:31 - making the scene fade in if it's minus
05:34 - one and out if it's one so do public
05:37 - float begin Fade with the parameter
05:41 - direction of type int the reason why
05:44 - it's called a public float and not a
05:46 - public V is because we wanted to return
05:50 - something the thing we wanted to return
05:53 - the thing I've just written is the fade
05:56 - speed this will allow us in another
05:58 - script to to have a variable variable be
06:01 - equal to the Fate speed and therefore we
06:05 - can easily uh calculate the time that it
06:08 - will takes to take to fade out and
06:10 - therefore time the application. load
06:12 - level so we don't load a new level
06:15 - before it's faded out or way too long
06:17 - after all you need to know that that is
06:20 - that it returns this value whenever the
06:22 - function is called and we're going to
06:24 - see an example of how we can use this in
06:26 - a
06:27 - sec next up we're going to do an onlevel
06:30 - was loaded function in order to uh call
06:34 - the begin fade whenever a level loads so
06:38 - this way we're just going to automate
06:40 - The Fading whenever uh a level is loaded
06:43 - and therefore we're going to fade in
06:45 - every time we uh play a new
06:48 - scene and of course we're going to call
06:50 - the function with the faded direction of
06:53 - minus one meaning that we will fade
06:56 - in you could also set the alpha to one
07:00 - right before should your Alpha not be
07:03 - equal to one by default or if you uh
07:06 - change it in other ways that's may be a
07:09 - good idea um depending on your game so
07:12 - if it's behaving really try that out now
07:15 - we can save the script and we're
07:17 - actually ready to head over to
07:21 - Unity so if we select the GM object you
07:24 - can see that we have two new variables
07:27 - the first one the Fade Out texture we're
07:30 - simply going to set to a black
07:32 - image this image you can find on the
07:35 - internet or you can create for yourself
07:38 - it's really simple and you can see here
07:40 - the import settings for my image it's
07:43 - just a 2X two texture meaning that it's
07:46 - only two pixels wide the fade speed I'm
07:50 - just going to leave at
07:52 - 0.8 and then now let's take a look at
07:54 - the SEL the SEL in my game is a pickup
07:58 - that will change scenes whenever the
07:59 - player collides with it so let's open up
08:02 - the script for
08:04 - this in here there's a bunch of logic
08:07 - all we need to worry about is the
08:09 - function called change level and inside
08:12 - of this function there's only three
08:14 - lines of code that handles the fading
08:16 - out and the level
08:18 - changing so this Fades out the game and
08:21 - loads a new level let's have a look at
08:23 - the first
08:25 - line this statement uses game object.
08:28 - find to find the object that the script
08:30 - is sitting on it just finds the object
08:33 - with called underscore GM if your object
08:36 - is called something else of course
08:38 - change this to your object's name it's
08:41 - generally a bad idea to use Game object.
08:44 - find a lot because it's taxing on the
08:46 - computer so if you need to do this a
08:48 - whole bunch I recommend you do it at
08:50 - this in the start of the
08:52 - game also we then use get component to
08:56 - find the fading script on that game
08:58 - object we're going to change the fade to
09:00 - fading in just a sec that was just a
09:03 - mistake then we dot begin Fade to call
09:07 - the function we can do this because
09:09 - we've made the function public and
09:12 - therefore it's accessible from the
09:14 - script then we pass it the parameter one
09:17 - because we want it to fade out we also
09:20 - create a new variable a float variable
09:23 - that stores the fade time which was
09:25 - called fade speed in the other script we
09:28 - can use this to time when uh the um when
09:33 - the application will actually load a new
09:36 - level so we can use this uh simply to
09:40 - time the yield statement that you see
09:42 - here so this is a yield statement and it
09:45 - will wait for amount uh a certain amount
09:48 - of seconds and here we wait for fade
09:50 - time keep in mind that whenever you're
09:53 - using a yield statement you can't do it
09:55 - inside of the update function and you
09:57 - need to create a separate function to
09:59 - store it
10:01 - in next up we have the application. load
10:04 - level this just loads the new level this
10:08 - is where you pass it an index of your
10:10 - level which we're going to take a look
10:12 - in a sec when we're going to add our
10:14 - level to the build
10:17 - settings so that was all we needed to do
10:19 - now let's change Fade to fading to
10:22 - correct the mistake and let's H back
10:24 - into
10:25 - Unity now this is important go to file
10:29 - build
10:30 - settings and here you can see all of the
10:32 - scenes that will be included in your
10:35 - build whenever changing scenes through
10:37 - code they need to be in the build
10:39 - settings so you can see we have the
10:42 - fading main level one and two and over
10:45 - here on the right is the index if your
10:48 - scene is not on the list hit add current
10:51 - and it will add the selected scene so
10:54 - that was basically all for now if you're
10:56 - interested in more tutorials like this

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to fading between scenes in unity today we're going to be taking a look at making a script that will allow us to fade out change level and then fade back in with just a couple of lines of code that we can place anywhere in our game so first off I'm going to select uh an object this could be any object I'm just going to use the GM object and then I'm going to create a new script here let's call this fading it's going to be of type c so double click it to open it up in mono develop and let's start out by adding some variables I excuse the quality of the recording it's not as good as it as it normally is uh but we're going to change that uh in the next video don't worry so the first variable is a texture 2D we're going to call it Fade Out texture and this is just the image that will overlay the screen in our case it's just going to be black the next variable is a public float with the fade speed this is of course the speed we will fade in and out at then we're going to make a private integer called Draw depth and we're going to set this to minus a th000 this is the textures um draw order in the hierarchy meaning that it will be drawn last and therefore it will render on top so we're just making sure that the black image we are going to fade in and out is going to be on top of everything else then we make a private float with the alpha and we just set this uh as with a default to one so it's going to start out by being completely visible then we make a private in called fade Direction and we equal uh or we default this to minus one this is the direction to fade if it's equal to minus one it will fade in and if it's equal to 1 it will fade out let's just go ahead and uh delete the two functions here and make a new one called on GUI and this is going to be uh good for rendering different kinds of Graphics um so this is unity's function for rendering guy and uh then first we're going to fade in and out the alpha value using a direction a speed and time. Delta time which will convert the operation to seconds so we do this by setting saying Alpha plus equals fate Direction time fade speed times time. Delta time next up we force uh or what is called clamp the uh value to be between zero and one this is because that the guy. color uses a alpha value between zero and 1 so Alpha equals math. clamp one because that will clamp it between zero and one and then we input the alpha next up let's set the color of a DUI in this case our texture or the black image and uh we really want the color values to just stay the same the only value we want to change just the alpha and this is included in the dui. color so do dui. color equals new color and inside of this we're going to pass it the GUI color. R for red gu color G uhg for green andb for blue and then we're going to type in the the alpha at last so here we are setting the alpha next up we're going to dui. depth and we're going to equal this to our draw depth so here we are making sure that the black texture will render on top then we're saying GUI draw. draw texture and inside of this we are going to type new rect which is four values and inside of this rectangle we going to do 0 comma 0 screen do width comma screen do height so that means it will fill the whole screen it will take the 0 comma 0 point which is the top left corner and it will extend to the width and the height using the fade out texture meaning that we will overlay the Fade Out texture on the entire screen so now we've actually written all the logic we need in order for the image to fade smoothly in and out now we just need some functions that will set the direction to fade in and we're going to make these available from other scripts also so here we're going to set the fade direction to the the direction parameter making the scene fade in if it's minus one and out if it's one so do public float begin Fade with the parameter direction of type int the

another script to to have a variable variable be equal to the Fate speed and therefore we can easily uh calculate the time that it will takes to take to fade out and therefore time the application. load level so we don't load a new level before it's faded out or way too long after all you need to know that that is that it returns this value whenever the function is called and we're going to see
