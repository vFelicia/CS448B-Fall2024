00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to this
00:01 - special Q&A video so I've reached the
00:03 - 200,000 subscriber mark and I'm just so
00:05 - excited so I want to take this
00:06 - opportunity to thank you guys so much
00:08 - for supporting me and making me want to
00:10 - keep making videos you guys send in a
00:12 - bunch of questions let's answer them
00:14 - what's the most important advice that
00:15 - you want to give to younger developers
00:17 - that are just starting out probably the
00:18 - most important advice that I have to
00:20 - give is for you to find something that
00:22 - you think it's fun and then just do that
00:25 - I don't think you should really find a
00:27 - programming language that will lead you
00:29 - to the best paying job or necessarily
00:31 - try and build up skills so you can get
00:34 - in on this college or whatever I think
00:36 - the most important thing is work on
00:38 - something that you have fun working on
00:39 - and that you want to make and then just
00:42 - have game development and programming be
00:44 - kind of the tool that you use to create
00:47 - that thing that really helps drive you
00:49 - in your own development and it's
00:50 - something that I found personally that
00:52 - when I do that I just learn so much
00:55 - quicker what car do you have I don't
01:00 - have a car in fact I don't even have a
01:02 - driver's license it's pretty normal to
01:04 - ride a bike in Denmark how do you set
01:06 - the goals for each coding session you
01:08 - seem to have a structure that allows you
01:10 - to do everything so smoothly Thanks
01:12 - how can I do the same what tips do you
01:14 - have for planning a session this one I
01:16 - have something about if you need to
01:18 - write a big scary module and have a hard
01:20 - time kind of knowing where to start and
01:22 - where to end you should really plan
01:24 - ahead before you actually start coding I
01:26 - suggest just sitting down with a blank
01:28 - piece of paper and sketching out what
01:30 - you want to end up with and kind of
01:31 - breaking that down into smaller
01:33 - functions really I think having a good
01:35 - overview of your code is really up to
01:37 - creating very small functions that only
01:40 - do one thing the more you're able to
01:42 - split your code into small functions the
01:44 - more you're able to describe what you're
01:45 - actually doing oh and it also helps that
01:47 - I always practice my tutorials before
01:48 - recording now that you have two hundred
01:50 - thousand subscribers what will you do
01:52 - with all the money you're in I think
01:53 - there's a lot of confusion about how
01:55 - much money youtubers actually earn I can
01:57 - say for a fact I don't earn a lot of
01:59 - money in fact I hardly earn enough to
02:01 - make a living at least off of YouTube
02:03 - ads having two hundred thousand
02:05 - subscribers does not mean
02:06 - a lot of views and definitely not a lot
02:09 - of ad revenue it's really the best thing
02:11 - you can do if you want me to keep making
02:12 - videos is support me on patreon which
02:14 - you can do it patreon.com slash Brady's
02:16 - that was pretty smooth when we get to
02:19 - play an official game made by you do you
02:21 - sell any of the games you make and if
02:23 - you sell games where can we buy them
02:24 - from in fact I don't currently sell any
02:26 - of my games online really most of what I
02:29 - create these days are hobby projects or
02:31 - stuff for tutorials my latest creation
02:33 - is probably my Ludum dare entry and
02:36 - that's just a silly thing I made in 48
02:38 - hours so I wouldn't really have a place
02:40 - to point you if you want to play one of
02:42 - my games on Steam or anything like that
02:43 - can you please make a turn-based
02:45 - strategy game tutorial I would love to
02:47 - do some more with strategy based games
02:50 - I think the tower defence course covers
02:52 - a lot of the stuff that you're going to
02:53 - need when creating that kind of game but
02:55 - if enough of you guys ask for it I'll
02:57 - definitely see what I can do what was
02:59 - the proudest moment of your life that's
03:01 - definitely when I scored that lovely
03:03 - lady standing behind the camera how is
03:04 - it to be one of the biggest Danish
03:06 - youtubers this is actually a pretty fun
03:08 - question because um I am on some kind of
03:11 - top list there when it comes to
03:13 - subscriber count' or something like that
03:15 - but I always get forgotten in Danish
03:18 - media I see so many of these out top
03:20 - Danish youtubers and one of the biggest
03:22 - Danish youtubers and I just always get
03:24 - ignored I think people are probably not
03:26 - so interested in tutorial makers and
03:29 - really don't see it as a youtuber thing
03:31 - more as a nerdy thing that they want to
03:33 - stay away from less in fact the Danish
03:34 - YouTube award show that I never get
03:36 - invited to I'm not salty about that at
03:39 - all what's your cat's name always loved
03:42 - the surprise appearances I'm glad you
03:44 - guys like those they are annoying as
03:45 - heck for me so this is Charley say hi
03:49 - and this is Molly
03:51 - she just woke up so this is a good one
03:54 - how do you get game ideas I would like
03:56 - to know um if you know how to get game
03:59 - ideas definitely make a video about it
04:01 - because I don't have a good answer
04:02 - really what you should do is just sit
04:04 - down try and draw something out as quick
04:07 - as you possibly can just as many ideas
04:09 - as possible and I think that's the best
04:12 - way to kind of get your creative side
04:14 - going what you can also do is think of
04:16 - games you like and then ways that you
04:18 - can put
04:19 - been on that or recreated with your own
04:21 - personal touch of course I tried to put
04:23 - some kind of twist in there but it's
04:25 - also a good exercise just to try and
04:27 - recreate something some other better
04:28 - developer did before you so I think
04:30 - that's pretty much all the questions
04:31 - we're going to do now I had a lot of fun
04:33 - and if you want to see more of these Q&A
04:35 - videos definitely let me know also if
04:37 - you're just hungry for more questions
