00:00 - - So we recently held the fourth
official Brackeys Game Jam,
00:03 - an event where you get one week
to make a game from scratch.
00:06 - And we were so overwhelmed
00:07 - with how many people
participated in the jam.
00:10 - Over 8,800 people joined,
00:12 - and we got more than 1800 submissions,
00:14 - which is more than twice
as many as the previous,
00:17 - and almost 11 times the first jam.
00:19 - As always, we've been
looking forward to seeing
00:21 - what you guys can make in
such a small amount of time,
00:24 - and once again, we're impressed
00:26 - with how creative you guys are.
00:28 - Truly an amazing job.
00:29 - And before we have a look
at some of the cool games,
00:31 - I just want to give a
huge thank you to everyone
00:34 - who joined the jam and
helped make it awesome.
00:36 - We've been playing as many
games as we possibly could,
00:39 - and while all of them are
great in their own way,
00:41 - we've picked out a few to
show you in this video.
00:44 - So without further ado,
00:45 - let's check out some of the awesome games
00:47 - from the Brackeys Game Jam.
00:48 - But first, this video
is sponsored by Radical.
00:51 - Radical offers a number of
tools that make it easier
00:53 - than ever to create 3D
animations for your game.
00:56 - Through AI-powered 3D motion animation,
00:58 - you can turn any regular
2D video of a person
01:01 - into a full set of 3D motion capture data.
01:03 - This means no need for advanced
motion capture equipment,
01:06 - which just makes this a
very affordable solution
01:09 - for motion capture.
01:10 - With their desktop solution studio,
01:12 - you get unlimited at-home motion
capture for less than $400.
01:16 - Once you're happy with an animation,
01:18 - simply export the FBX file
and drag it into your project.
01:21 - Later this month, Radical
will also be launching
01:23 - a livestream feature for Unity,
01:25 - which gives you the
possibility to do real-time
01:27 - 3D animations inside the Unity Editor.
01:30 - So if this sounds interesting,
01:31 - I definitely recommend
you check out Radical
01:33 - by simply clicking the
link in the description.
01:35 - So the theme for the jam was rewind.
01:38 - - Ah!
01:43 - Oh, that's hot. That's hot.
01:44 - - So let's rewind and take
a look at some of the games
01:47 - we played in no particular order.
01:49 - Also, huge thanks to Mastro2K
for his support on Patreon.
01:53 - First up, "Divided Dungeon"
is a game where you control
01:55 - a group of characters
trying to escape a dungeon.
01:58 - They must work together
in order to escape,
02:00 - which might sound like the
pitch for a multiplayer game,
02:04 - but it's not.
02:05 - Instead, you take control
of one character at a time.
02:08 - Then rewind, and now that
character will move on its own
02:12 - based on the inputs you just made.
02:14 - Pretty simple premise, but
it gets chaotic very fast
02:17 - because you can still push and
offset the other characters,
02:20 - completely screwing up their path.
02:22 - So you really have to plan out every move
02:24 - you're going to make and
then execute them perfectly.
02:27 - The only thing I would do
to make the game even better
02:29 - is change the movement to be more precise
02:31 - in order to more easily
manoeuvre around your teammates.
02:34 - Other than that, I had a tonne of fun,
02:36 - and I think this game
has a lot of potential.
02:38 - A game with great and
snappy controls, though,
02:40 - is "Lost in City."
02:42 - In this game, you play as a girl
02:44 - who is looking for her cat
that got lost in the city.
02:47 - The girl has a special power
that allows her to reverse time
02:50 - of her surroundings, but not herself.
02:53 - (gentle music)
02:56 - This fairly simple mechanic
makes for some very engaging
02:58 - and challenging puzzles.
03:00 - Plus I really liked the idea
of the wind blowing backwards
03:03 - when you're reversing time.
03:05 - Overall, a solid experience.
03:07 - And speaking of experience,
03:09 - here's someone who's not having
a particularly great one.
03:12 - In "It's a wrap!" you're a movie director
03:15 - that just wants to make a nice film.
03:17 - But people keep messing up their parts.
03:19 - So you have to correct the
timings on the timeline
03:22 - in the bottom so you
can get the shot done.
03:24 - When ready, you can go into action mode
03:26 - to play out the scene as the protagonist.
03:29 - The gameplay of "It's a
wrap!" is very unique and fun,
03:32 - and I enjoyed every second of it.
03:34 - And it's a great excuse to put the player
03:36 - in all kinds of weird situations,
03:37 - which allows for some pretty
fun and unexpected levels.
03:41 - Another game I really like is "ReColor."
03:43 - The game has a simple concept.
03:45 - You can change the colour of
your cube to solve puzzles
03:48 - and then rewind back through
the colours at any time.
03:52 - As you can imagine, it gets
complicated very quickly.
03:55 - I think this is really interesting,
03:57 - because normally in platformers,
03:59 - you deal with everything linearly.
04:01 - You handle the current obstacle
04:02 - and then move on to the next.
04:04 - "ReCall" is the complete opposite,
04:06 - because you have to plan out
every move you're going to make
04:09 - in the entire level
before you actually do it.
04:12 - The graphics and controls are very simple,
04:14 - but the experience feels
quite fleshed out anyways.
04:16 - Great game with complicated puzzles.
04:19 - Another game that had me
planning out every move
04:21 - was "Retro Rift."
04:23 - Here you have to make
your way through the level
04:25 - to reach the rift.
04:26 - Once you've done this,
you'll have to do it again,
04:28 - but this time you must
avoid evil clones of you
04:31 - that are tracing your path backwards.
04:33 - These clones will kill on contact,
04:35 - so you really have to plan
your route and timing.
04:38 - I am in love with this concept,
04:40 - and it's only possible
because of the game's
04:42 - great movement code.
04:44 - I really felt in control of the character,
04:45 - making me able to do very
precise jumps and movements.
04:48 - Which I think is pretty necessary
04:50 - in order to complete levels such as this.
04:53 - Let's not talk about how
long that took to complete.
04:56 - But I really enjoy a challenge,
04:57 - and this game gave me that
in an extremely fun way.
05:00 - Besides that, the game looks amazing.
05:03 - Everything from the pixel
art to the cool effects
05:05 - when rewinding time, and the
intense, glitchy soundtrack.
05:11 - Now, if you just need to
relax for a few minutes
05:13 - on top of the frantic
gameplay of "Retro Rift,"
05:16 - I suggest you try out "Playback."
05:18 - It's a cute little puzzle game
05:19 - that's all about making people feel good.
05:22 - See, the people in town
are feeling a bit down
05:24 - and could really use something
to brighten up their day.
05:27 - So it's up to you to record sounds
05:29 - with your cassette recorder and
use them to help people out.
05:32 - (gentle music)
05:36 - "Playback" is a fun and innovative game
05:39 - with cute graphics and story.
05:41 - Another awesome game was "Dux Nox."
05:45 - This game not only fits
the theme perfectly,
05:47 - but it also looks and sounds great.
05:49 - The core gameplay is simple.
05:51 - You move the white
rabbit to the black one,
05:53 - and the black will follow the
same route to the beginning.
05:56 - The twist here is that
only the black rabbit
05:59 - can interact with green objects.
06:01 - Pretty simple mechanic, but it allows
06:02 - for some extremely complex
and mind-boggling puzzles.
06:05 - And I must admit that some of them took
06:07 - embarrassingly long to figure out.
06:10 - "Dux Nox" is a solid game just
waiting for a release date.
06:14 - In "Re-Wind," you're a paper plane pilot.
06:17 - Try saying that three times in a row.
06:19 - As a paper plane pilot,
06:21 - you're not only able to control the plane,
06:23 - but also the wind around it.
06:25 - Use this power to navigate
through the tough weather
06:27 - and to prove that you are
the best paper plane pilot
06:30 - the world has ever seen.
06:31 - Also, something seems strangely familiar.
06:34 - This soundtrack kind of
reminds me of something.
06:38 - (frantic music)
06:41 - Next up, we've got another
game with almost the same name,
06:43 - but completely different gameplay.
06:45 - "Rewind" is a puzzle platformer game
06:48 - where you use your time reversal mechanic
06:50 - to get to the end of the levels.
06:51 - Everything but the player
can be rewinded separately.
06:54 - This means that unlocked
doors can work as bridges
06:57 - and falling platforms become elevators.
07:00 - All the game needs is more levels.
07:02 - In "Psycho Taxi - Rewind,"
you're a taxi driver
07:05 - that has to get customers to
their desired destination.
07:08 - But there's a twist.
07:10 - The taxi is powered by
a rewindable spring.
07:13 - Get it? Because you twist it.
07:15 - Anyways, every time you pick someone up,
07:18 - they'll wind up your taxi
to give you more time.
07:20 - The goal of the game is to get
as many points as possible.
07:23 - And how do you get points?
By being fast, of course.
07:26 - And by being as stylish as
possible while doing it.
07:29 - And by stylish, I of course mean chaotic.
07:32 - I think the gameplay speaks for itself.
07:34 - This is a very frantic but fun game,
07:36 - it kind of reminds me of old arcade games.
07:38 - If I had to give some
constructive feedback,
07:40 - it would be that it takes way
too long to restart the game.
07:43 - We just want to get back into the fun.
07:46 - Now, one of my absolute
favourite games is "Sir Ewind."
07:51 - I see what you did there.
07:52 - In this game, you play as
the wonderfully designed
07:54 - character Sir Ewind, a time
travelling space wizard
07:58 - assigned with the task of
eliminating all paradox creatures.
08:01 - His only weapon is his ability
to manipulate space time.
08:05 - You can rewind and freeze
time for the entire map
08:07 - or just a single creature.
08:09 - Sir Ewind can use the cuckoo clocks
08:11 - scattered around the levels
to eliminate the enemies.
08:14 - I really liked this seamless
tutorial at the start.
08:17 - It helped me get going
without slowing the game down.
08:20 - Pun intended.
08:21 - Everything about this
game is very polished.
08:23 - The audio design is nice,
the graphics are awesome,
08:26 - and the mechanics and levels are great.
08:30 - And speaking of time travel,
08:32 - here's a game that has absolutely
nothing to do with that.
08:34 - "Rhythm Rewind" is a simple rhythm game,
08:37 - but boy is it addicting.
08:39 - I tapped along for way too long
08:41 - even though it only has one song.
08:44 - Oh, that rhymes.
08:45 - I tapped along for way too long,
08:47 - even though it only has one song.
08:49 - (crickets chirping)
08:51 - It's really hard at first,
08:52 - but when you get a hang of the controls,
08:53 - it feels so good to play.
08:55 - And you'll have a hard time
putting this game down.
08:57 - The funkiness is simply too strong.
09:00 - I don't have much else
to say, just go play.
09:03 - "What the...? REWIND THAT!"
09:07 - is the name of the next game.
09:08 - In this game, you start out with a scene
09:10 - where some kind of accident happens.
09:13 - Some knights get run down by a boulder
09:15 - or a king gets shot by arrows.
09:17 - It is your job to wind back
time and save everyone.
09:20 - You do this by adding forces
to objects around the scene.
09:23 - With this you can prevent the arrow
09:25 - from hitting the explosive barrels,
09:27 - or throw a table at the barrage of arrows
09:29 - heading towards the king.
09:30 - Cool concept, however, the
implementation is pretty rough.
09:33 - But clean up some rough edges
09:35 - and you have a really cool game.
09:37 - Finally, "Rhombus" takes
the rewind time mechanic
09:40 - and adds some more layers.
09:42 - In this game, you can
choose to rewind everything
09:44 - or leave your character as is.
09:46 - Also, you can't jump, so most of the time
09:49 - you have to rewind your
fall to get back up.
09:51 - But this means that
whatever you did before that
09:53 - will get rewinded.
09:54 - This is where the locks come in.
09:56 - With the locks, you can lock an object,
09:58 - making it immune to time rewinding.
10:00 - These few mechanics make for some fun
10:02 - and challenging levels.
10:03 - Besides that, it's just a
cute and really polished game.
10:06 - And I completed it on the
last chord of the song,
10:09 - which I found pretty satisfying.
10:14 - And now that we've played the final chord,
10:16 - I guess that's all the
games that we have time for
10:18 - in this video.
10:19 - Of course, there are so many amazing games
10:21 - that we haven't talked about,
10:22 - so I really encourage you
to go play them yourself.
10:25 - There's of course a
link in the description
10:26 - where you can find all of the jam games.
10:28 - And the voting period has ended.
10:30 - So a huge congratulations
to the makers of "Dux Nox"
10:34 - for winning overall,
10:35 - and to all the category
winners on the screen now.
10:37 - Finally, I would just
like to thank AquaXV,
10:40 - Codemyst, Hucota, Job, TheDutchMagikarp,
10:43 - and Yilian for organising
this amazing event,
10:46 - and thanks to all of the participators

Cleaned transcript:

So we recently held the fourth official Brackeys Game Jam, an event where you get one week to make a game from scratch. And we were so overwhelmed with how many people participated in the jam. Over 8,800 people joined, and we got more than 1800 submissions, which is more than twice as many as the previous, and almost 11 times the first jam. As always, we've been looking forward to seeing what you guys can make in such a small amount of time, and once again, we're impressed with how creative you guys are. Truly an amazing job. And before we have a look at some of the cool games, I just want to give a huge thank you to everyone who joined the jam and helped make it awesome. We've been playing as many games as we possibly could, and while all of them are great in their own way, we've picked out a few to show you in this video.

There's of course a link in the description where you can find all of the jam games. And the voting period has ended. So a huge congratulations to the makers of "Dux Nox" for winning overall, and to all the category winners on the screen now. Finally, I would just like to thank AquaXV, Codemyst, Hucota, Job, TheDutchMagikarp, and Yilian for organising this amazing event, and thanks to all of the participators for making it awesome.
