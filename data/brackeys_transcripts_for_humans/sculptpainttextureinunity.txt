00:00 - one of the biggest pain points for a lot
00:01 - of unit users has always been the lack
00:03 - of powerful artist friendly toes luckily
00:06 - the wait is over unity has acquired poly
00:09 - brush and pro builder which are two
00:11 - really powerful assets for building
00:13 - levels inside of the unity editor poly
00:15 - brush is still in beta but it already
00:17 - has a bunch of great tools for sculpting
00:19 - painting texturing and quickly adding
00:22 - prefabs to your levels so in this video
00:24 - we'll have a look at how to use it also
00:26 - special thanks to encode we trust
00:28 - patrick mckinley diego frank
00:30 - tristan down died when buffy o infinity
00:32 - PPR and yo Rio mer for their support on
00:35 - patreon and with that let's get painting
00:37 - so to start using poly brush we need to
00:39 - make sure that we included in our
00:41 - project at the time of recording this
00:43 - video it's available on github of course
00:45 - have a link to it in the description
00:47 - along with this example scene now once
00:49 - you have the tools installed we can go
00:51 - to the top here and go into tools poly
00:53 - brush and open up the poly brush window
00:55 - and right away this window pops up we
00:58 - can put it somewhere in the unity editor
00:59 - or we can right click on it and hit open
01:02 - as floating window and then we can have
01:04 - it kind of to the side of our scene view
01:06 - here and right away now if we select a
01:08 - mesh in our scenes I'm gonna select my
01:10 - example plane here and hover over it we
01:13 - can see that our brush appears if I hold
01:15 - down left mouse I can actually sculpt
01:17 - this plane but depending on the lighting
01:19 - environment the changes can be pretty
01:21 - hard to see so what I like to do is
01:24 - normally go to the top left corner and
01:26 - change from shaded to shaded wireframe
01:29 - this helps show what's happening
01:30 - whenever we sculpt our mesh I do however
01:33 - want to make the wireframe a bit more
01:35 - transparent luckily we can quickly do
01:37 - this by going edit preferences then
01:40 - selecting colors and if we scroll to the
01:43 - bottom there's one here called wireframe
01:45 - overlay here we can change the color of
01:47 - it I'm just gonna keep this black but we
01:49 - can also reduce our alpha there we go so
01:52 - it's just a subtle effect let's then
01:54 - close down our preferences and now we're
01:56 - ready to go through the different tools
01:57 - at our disposal at the very top here you
02:00 - can choose what painting mode you want
02:01 - to use currently Wayne sculpting mode
02:03 - which allows us to push and pull
02:05 - vertices so here by simply clicking we
02:08 - can create Hills and if we hold down
02:09 - ctrl while clicking we can go ahead and
02:12 - push the vertices
02:13 - back in then we of course have all of
02:15 - our brush settings and these are pretty
02:17 - much the same for all of our tools here
02:20 - we can control the outer radius of our
02:22 - brush we can either control this using
02:24 - the slider as you can see I've just made
02:26 - it a lot bigger or we can hold down
02:28 - control and scroll in order to change it
02:30 - we can also change the inner radius of
02:32 - our brush using this slider here or we
02:35 - could simply hold down shift and scroll
02:37 - if we fully increase our inner radius
02:39 - we'll get a very hard brush and if we
02:42 - decrease it we'll get a much softer
02:45 - brush finally we can control the
02:47 - strength of our brush by using this
02:48 - slider in the middle here we can also
02:50 - hold down both control and shift while
02:53 - scrolling in order to change it of
02:55 - course the greater the strength the more
02:57 - we will influence the terrain while
02:59 - sculpting when we are satisfied with our
03:01 - brush settings we also have some
03:02 - settings for how we want to push and
03:04 - pull here we can choose whether or not
03:06 - we want to ignore open edges you can see
03:09 - with this enabled we won't actually be
03:11 - able to change the height of the sides
03:13 - of our plane here whereas if I change
03:15 - that we can clearly influence that as
03:18 - well I'm just gonna leave that on for
03:19 - now we also have a setting called brush
03:21 - normal is sticky with this enabled if we
03:24 - place our brush somewhere on the mesh
03:26 - and click and drag will change all the
03:29 - vertices in the same direction as when
03:32 - we started whereas if we disable this
03:34 - the brush will go ahead and change them
03:36 - in the direction that it's currently
03:38 - facing at all times we can also change
03:41 - the direction that we want to use here
03:43 - we can use either the brush normal which
03:45 - is just the way that the brush is facing
03:47 - another option is vertex normal which
03:49 - will pull each one of the vertices in
03:51 - their current direction so you can see
03:53 - here what that does or we can choose a
03:56 - given direction if we wanted to pull
03:58 - over the C's to the right here we could
04:00 - do that I'm just going to leave this add
04:03 - brush normal and finally the brush
04:05 - effect allows us to control the overall
04:07 - strength of our brush most of the time
04:09 - we just use the strength to fine-tune
04:11 - this but if you're working with a very
04:13 - large or very small model you might want
04:15 - to go and adjust the brush effect and
04:17 - now we've actually created some detail
04:19 - to our plane however when sculpting we
04:22 - often end up with these fairly hard
04:24 - edges
04:25 - luckily poly brush has a two
04:27 - for smoothing these out to select this
04:29 - tool we click on the second icon up here
04:31 - now I'm gonna increase the strength of
04:33 - my brush here and you can see right away
04:36 - when we start painting it kind of
04:37 - smooths out our entire surface and now
04:40 - it actually looks much better and more
04:42 - natural one of the cool things about
04:44 - poly brush is that it doesn't only work
04:46 - on flat planes we can use it to sculpt
04:49 - and paint any kind of mesh for example
04:52 - if we're working with a sphere I can go
04:54 - under the scope tool and now we can
04:56 - actually sculpt directly on the sphere
04:59 - so this opens up a world of possibility
05:02 - for now let's go back to our example
05:04 - plane and the last thing that I want to
05:06 - show you before we move on to coloring
05:08 - is brush mirroring these are the
05:10 - settings right here in the middle of our
05:12 - window this of course allows us to
05:13 - mirror changes over a certain axis say
05:16 - we wanted to mirror on the X I'm gonna
05:18 - select X here and now whenever we paint
05:21 - we do so on both sides of the plane in
05:24 - fact we can mirror on multiple axes at
05:26 - once
05:26 - if we select both X and Z here you can
05:29 - see that poly brush will automatically
05:31 - paint on both axes so that's pretty cool
05:34 - now the third tool here is used for
05:36 - painting vertex colors of course in
05:39 - order to see our painting we need to
05:40 - make sure we have a material applied to
05:42 - our object that supports vertex colors
05:44 - right now it's notifying us down here
05:46 - that we don't so I'm gonna select my
05:48 - material that I currently have applied
05:50 - here I'm gonna go to the top to change
05:52 - the shader I'm gonna go into a poly
05:54 - brush here we have a bunch of different
05:57 - shaders available you can read more
05:59 - about what each one does in the
06:00 - documentation in my case I'm just gonna
06:03 - select diffuse vertex color now right
06:05 - away our plane turns white I'm gonna
06:08 - select it again and now when we hover
06:10 - over it we can see that we can actually
06:11 - paint with this green color so I'm gonna
06:14 - go ahead and paint the hills green here
06:17 - we can control the color at the bottom
06:19 - here so I'm gonna go and find some kind
06:22 - of brown and if you find a color that
06:25 - you like you can always hit the plus
06:26 - sign in order to add it to the palette
06:29 - and if you make a palette that you want
06:31 - to save you can always go to red says
06:32 - default and create new palettes with
06:35 - different colors in each one in fact we
06:37 - can do the same thing with our brush
06:39 - setting so if we really like
06:40 - the configuration of the brush we would
06:42 - go to the top here and add new brushes
06:45 - and you can always press this button
06:47 - here to save your current settings so
06:50 - now I'm going to increase the strength
06:51 - of my brush here and I'm gonna paint in
06:53 - some Brown and finally I'm gonna select
06:55 - a light blue and I'm gonna decrease the
06:58 - size of my brush and paint that in down
07:01 - here I'm also going to go in here and
07:06 - add a tiny bit of detail with the green
07:08 - and I'm gonna do the same thing with a
07:11 - light orange so now we have something
07:14 - that somewhat resembles some kind of
07:16 - island like structure I will have to
07:19 - excuse my artistic talent here but I
07:21 - hope you get the idea
07:23 - under our paint settings we can also
07:24 - change from brush mode into fill if we
07:27 - increase the strength here to 1 you can
07:30 - see using fill we can paint directly on
07:32 - top of vertices without any kind of
07:34 - smoothing and we can also change to
07:37 - flood which is going to affect our
07:39 - entire mesh then the next tool in the
07:41 - list is the paint prefabs tool we use
07:44 - this for easily distributing prefabs
07:46 - over all level this is great for adding
07:48 - lots of smaller detail pieces such as
07:51 - foliage which can take painfully long if
07:53 - you do it by hand here we have all these
07:56 - standard brush settings and then at the
07:58 - bottom here we have a place where we can
08:00 - drag in prefabs so I've gone ahead and
08:02 - prepared three rock variations that we
08:05 - can use so I'm just gonna drag them in
08:06 - one by one and we can see them displayed
08:08 - here we then select one of them I'm
08:11 - gonna select the one in the middle and
08:12 - we should then be able to paint these on
08:15 - top of our model I think the density is
08:17 - currently way too much so I'm gonna undo
08:19 - this and I'm definitely gonna decrease
08:21 - the strength of my brush and now we're
08:23 - painting much fewer onto the environment
08:25 - another neat feature is that we can
08:27 - place multiple rocks at once by holding
08:29 - down shift and selecting more of them
08:31 - and now we can easily scatter rocks of
08:33 - different sizes throughout our
08:36 - environment we also have a few placement
08:38 - settings that we can configure you can
08:40 - choose whether or not we want to use the
08:42 - pivot of the object when determining how
08:44 - to place it in my case I've gone ahead
08:46 - and prepared a pivot that makes sense so
08:48 - I want that enabled another important
08:50 - setting is the hit surface is parent
08:53 - which
08:53 - when it is enabled we'll go ahead and
08:55 - place all the objects under the surface
08:58 - that we paint - this is great for not
09:00 - cluttering your hierarchy and finally if
09:02 - you want to avoid overlap you can turn
09:04 - this on as well so now I'm just gonna
09:06 - place a few rocks around the environment
09:09 - here and I would say that that looks
09:11 - good but I know it doesn't so I'm just
09:13 - gonna pretend that I don't care and the
09:18 - final tool that we have at our disposal
09:19 - is the texture paint tool if we select
09:22 - this we get another warning saying that
09:25 - our material currently doesn't support
09:27 - it so let's again go to our plain
09:28 - material well then go to the top here
09:30 - and go and do a poly brush and let's
09:33 - select standard texture blend here we
09:35 - can give it some different textures to
09:37 - use for the base color I'm just gonna
09:39 - choose the grass then as texture one I'm
09:41 - gonna select dirt texture two I'm gonna
09:44 - select the ground texture that I have
09:46 - and protector three let's go ahead and
09:48 - choose sand if we then go and select our
09:50 - poly brush tool and select the example
09:53 - plane we actually see the different
09:55 - textures that we have to choose from
09:56 - I'm gonna select the grass here increase
09:59 - the strength to one as well as bump up
10:01 - the size of our brush then I'm gonna
10:03 - change to the flood tool and I'm gonna
10:06 - select the model to make everything
10:07 - grass I think this will act as a nice
10:09 - space we then go and select our second
10:12 - texture I'm gonna go back to the brush
10:14 - tool now I want to place this on these
10:17 - sides here
10:18 - there we go I'm also going to lick the
10:20 - ground texture here that's placed that
10:22 - in the middle let's also try and grab
10:24 - the sand texture I'm gonna decrease the
10:27 - strength of the brush and the radius I'm
10:29 - gonna try and paint this in to kind of
10:31 - smooth out the texture transition here
10:34 - as well as down here so once again I
10:37 - know this is not pretty but we've
10:39 - actually managed to both sculpt smooth
10:42 - paint detail and texture and objects in
10:45 - a matter of just minutes so I think this
10:48 - tool is really really cool and I'm
10:50 - definitely looking forward to seeing
10:51 - what you guys will make of it hopefully
10:53 - you are better artists than I am in fact
10:56 - if you make something cool using this
10:58 - tool make sure to share it with me on
10:59 - Twitter at bracket Street and the final
11:02 - thing that I wanted to mention is that
11:03 - if we go to the very last button here
11:05 - there are a bunch of general set
11:07 - that you can configure so if you're
11:09 - using the tool a lot definitely
11:11 - experiment with these to best suit your
11:12 - workflow that's pretty much all I wanted
11:14 - to cover in this video
11:16 - now I expect a lot of this stuff is
11:17 - going to change over the next few months
11:19 - as the acid is being rapidly worked on
11:22 - so definitely stay tuned for that
11:23 - also let me know if you would like to
11:25 - see a tutorial on pro builder as well on
11:27 - that

Cleaned transcript:

one of the biggest pain points for a lot of unit users has always been the lack of powerful artist friendly toes luckily the wait is over unity has acquired poly brush and pro builder which are two really powerful assets for building levels inside of the unity editor poly brush is still in beta but it already has a bunch of great tools for sculpting painting texturing and quickly adding prefabs to your levels so in this video we'll have a look at how to use it also special thanks to encode we trust patrick mckinley diego frank tristan down died when buffy o infinity PPR and yo Rio mer for their support on patreon and with that let's get painting so to start using poly brush we need to make sure that we included in our project at the time of recording this video it's available on github of course have a link to it in the description along with this example scene now once you have the tools installed we can go to the top here and go into tools poly brush and open up the poly brush window and right away this window pops up we can put it somewhere in the unity editor or we can right click on it and hit open as floating window and then we can have it kind of to the side of our scene view here and right away now if we select a mesh in our scenes I'm gonna select my example plane here and hover over it we can see that our brush appears if I hold down left mouse I can actually sculpt this plane but depending on the lighting environment the changes can be pretty hard to see so what I like to do is normally go to the top left corner and change from shaded to shaded wireframe this helps show what's happening whenever we sculpt our mesh I do however want to make the wireframe a bit more transparent luckily we can quickly do this by going edit preferences then selecting colors and if we scroll to the bottom there's one here called wireframe overlay here we can change the color of it I'm just gonna keep this black but we can also reduce our alpha there we go so it's just a subtle effect let's then close down our preferences and now we're ready to go through the different tools at our disposal at the very top here you can choose what painting mode you want to use currently Wayne sculpting mode which allows us to push and pull vertices so here by simply clicking we can create Hills and if we hold down ctrl while clicking we can go ahead and push the vertices back in then we of course have all of our brush settings and these are pretty much the same for all of our tools here we can control the outer radius of our brush we can either control this using the slider as you can see I've just made it a lot bigger or we can hold down control and scroll in order to change it we can also change the inner radius of our brush using this slider here or we could simply hold down shift and scroll if we fully increase our inner radius we'll get a very hard brush and if we decrease it we'll get a much softer brush finally we can control the strength of our brush by using this slider in the middle here we can also hold down both control and shift while scrolling in order to change it of course the greater the strength the more we will influence the terrain while sculpting when we are satisfied with our brush settings we also have some settings for how we want to push and pull here we can choose whether or not we want to ignore open edges you can see with this enabled we won't actually be able to change the height of the sides of our plane here whereas if I change that we can clearly influence that as well I'm just gonna leave that on for now we also have a setting called brush normal is sticky with this enabled if we place our brush somewhere on the mesh and click and drag will change all the vertices in the same direction as when we started whereas if we disable this the brush will go ahead and change them in the direction that it's currently facing at all times we can also change the direction that we want to use here we can use either the brush normal which is just the way that the brush is facing another option is vertex normal which will pull each one of the vertices in their current direction so you can see here what that does or we can choose a given direction if we wanted to pull over the C's to the right here we could do that I'm just going to leave this add brush normal and finally the brush effect allows us to control the overall strength of our brush most of the time we just use the strength to finetune this but if you're working with a very large or very small model you might want to go and adjust the brush effect and now we've actually created some detail to our plane however when sculpting we often end up with these fairly hard edges luckily poly brush has a two for smoothing these out to select this tool we click on the second icon up here now I'm gonna increase the strength of my brush here and you can see right away when we start painting it kind of smooths out our entire surface and now it

texture and objects in a matter of just minutes so I think this tool is really really cool and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what you guys will make of it hopefully you are better artists than I am in fact if you make something cool using this tool make sure to share it with me on Twitter at bracket Street and the final thing that I wanted to mention is that if we go to the very last button here there are a bunch of general set that you can configure so if you're using the tool a lot definitely experiment with these to best suit your workflow that's pretty much all I wanted to cover in this video now I expect a lot of this stuff is going to change over the next few months as the acid is being rapidly worked on so definitely stay tuned for that also let me know if you would like to see a tutorial on pro builder as well on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in February and especially thanks to
