00:00 - so one of the requests we get the most
00:01 - is to do a video on how to create water
00:03 - in unity and that's with many things in
00:16 - game development there are about a
00:18 - billion different ways to create water
00:19 - from realistic water with refraction to
00:22 - a more cartoony look of course all these
00:25 - techniques are great if you've been
00:26 - working with unity for a long time and
00:28 - want to pour pun intended a lot of
00:30 - effort into making the perfect water for
00:33 - your game however I think most of us
00:35 - probably just want to get some darn
00:36 - water working so in this video we'll
00:38 - have a look at how to create a water
00:40 - shader in what I think is the simplest
00:43 - possible way this should also helped act
00:45 - as a solid base if you want to look into
00:47 - expanding the effect with stuff like
00:49 - reflections refraction sine based waves
00:52 - or in normal maps but before we get into
00:54 - it this video is sponsored by hosting er
00:56 - if you've ever thought about creating a
00:58 - website or hosting your game on a server
01:00 - I really recommend you check out that
01:02 - different web hosting services they are
01:04 - extremely fast very affordable easy to
01:07 - get started with and provide a lot of
01:08 - value in their different solutions and
01:10 - that website builder will make
01:12 - everything a lot easier for you trust me
01:14 - building a website from scratch can be
01:16 - something else but what makes this
01:19 - really cool for game hosting is that
01:21 - they also offer cloud hosting services
01:23 - which means that you can store your or
01:25 - your users game data in the cloud get 82
01:28 - percent off for web hosting and a free
01:30 - domain included and use the coupon code
01:32 - practice for an additional 15% simply
01:35 - click the link in the description to get
01:36 - started also our friends from game dev
01:38 - unchained are hosting a really cool
01:40 - event it's called G ducks and it's
01:42 - basically an online game development
01:44 - conference I think this is such a cool
01:46 - thing
01:46 - since events like GDC can often be hard
01:48 - for the average developer to attend both
01:51 - because it's often very expensive and in
01:54 - another part of the world
01:55 - so instead G Ducks is going to be fully
01:57 - online and freely accessible the event
01:59 - will have three days of talks or live
02:01 - streamed which will include plenty of
02:03 - time to talk to other developers anyway
02:05 - just thought you guys should know about
02:07 - it if you think it sounds cold we'll
02:08 - have a link for that in the description
02:09 - now let's get floating
02:13 - so first of all you need to make sure
02:14 - that you're using unity mm 19.1 or later
02:18 - and that your project is set up to use
02:20 - the lightweight render pipeline if you
02:22 - don't know how to do that I'll of course
02:23 - have a link to where you can learn how
02:24 - in the description now let's go ahead
02:26 - and right-click in our hierarchy here
02:28 - and let's create a 3d object plane and
02:31 - this is going to be the base object for
02:33 - our water I'm just gonna go ahead and
02:35 - scale it down and kind of move it up and
02:37 - above some of the other objects here
02:39 - let's go ahead and rename this to simple
02:42 - cartoon water let's also go to our
02:45 - project and create a new shader and
02:48 - let's create a PP art graph let's call
02:50 - it cartoon water and hit enter and to
02:54 - create a material based on the shader
02:56 - that's right click on it and go create
02:59 - material and we can also call this
03:01 - cartoon water let's take this material
03:03 - and drag it on to our plane and that's
03:05 - pretty much all the setup we need to do
03:07 - I'm also just going to show you my
03:09 - lightweight rendering pipeline settings
03:11 - just so if something isn't working for
03:13 - you you can try to replicate these one
03:15 - thing that I've noticed is that working
03:17 - with transparent materials is a bit
03:19 - weird when Cascade is set to 2 or 4 so
03:23 - for now I'm gonna leave this at no
03:24 - Cascades let's then double click on a
03:26 - cartoon water shader to open it up in
03:29 - shader graph now the first thing that
03:31 - I'm gonna do is change the preview here
03:33 - from a sphere to a plane so I'm gonna
03:35 - choose custom mesh and search for the
03:37 - plane here and select the default plane
03:40 - I'm also going to go to our master node
03:42 - here and click on the little cog and
03:44 - change the surface type from opaque to
03:46 - transparent and now we're ready to add
03:48 - some notes and the first thing that I'd
03:50 - like to do is give our water a base
03:51 - color so let's go to a blackboard and
03:53 - let's add a color let's call it base
03:56 - color let's make this a bright blue
03:59 - something like that let's drag this in
04:02 - and link it to our albedo and right away
04:05 - you can see that our water changes color
04:07 - however having water that is only one
04:09 - color is of course not so interesting so
04:11 - let's go ahead and add some ripples to
04:13 - do this we'll hit space and search for
04:16 - the Voronoi node this is a very
04:18 - interesting type of similar andum noise
04:21 - and it's perfect for ripples since it
04:23 - creates all of these weird-looking cell
04:26 - that if we distort them a bit we'll look
04:29 - like ripples in water in fact let's try
04:31 - and do that now so if we adjust the
04:34 - angle offset here over time we can get a
04:37 - really interesting effect to do that
04:39 - let's create a time node let's hook this
04:41 - up to a multiply node in order to be
04:43 - able to control the speed of these
04:45 - ripples so that's go ahead and actually
04:47 - create a vector one for this let's call
04:49 - it ripple speed and let's just default
04:52 - it to something like point one drag it
04:54 - in and hook it up to our multiply and
04:57 - let's take the multiply over to our
04:58 - angle offset and right away we can see
05:00 - that they are slowly changing let's go
05:02 - ahead and bump this up to say 1 and we
05:04 - can now see how the different cells are
05:06 - kind of moving around we can also adjust
05:09 - the cell density here that's how many
05:11 - cells are kind of packed together so you
05:13 - can see we can increase or decrease that
05:16 - in fact let's go ahead and create a
05:17 - property to control this so let's again
05:20 - add a new vector 1 let's call this
05:22 - ripple density and let's default it to
05:25 - something like 7 let's drag that in hook
05:28 - it up to our cell density and clean up
05:30 - our graph a bit here
05:32 - there you go the next thing that I want
05:34 - to do is kind of tighten up the edges of
05:36 - our Voronoi currently everything is very
05:38 - blurred together and I'd like to bring
05:40 - out more contrast in the Voronoi in
05:42 - order to really show these lines going
05:44 - across so to do that let's take the
05:46 - output of a Voronoi and plug it into a
05:49 - power node and for the power here let's
05:52 - try and set that to something like 5 and
05:55 - now we really start to see how this
05:56 - looks like ripples in water let's just
05:59 - quickly create a property for this as
06:02 - well so up here and now the vector 1
06:04 - let's call it let's call it slimness and
06:07 - we can just default it to 5 let's make
06:10 - some space here drag in that ripple
06:13 - slimness and hook it up and I think at
06:16 - this point we're ready to start mixing
06:17 - together or ripples with our base color
06:20 - however in order to do that we probably
06:22 - want to give a ripple some color other
06:25 - than just a solid white so let's again
06:28 - go up here let's create a color property
06:31 - and let's call it ripple color for this
06:34 - one I'm gonna choose as the mode HDR
06:37 - just in order to allow us to control the
06:39 - intensity
06:39 - Ripple's let's set the color to a bit
06:43 - brighter of a blue and let's also give
06:45 - it an intensity of say one we can then
06:48 - take the ripple color and multiply it
06:50 - into the output of our power node so
06:52 - let's go multiply and multiply that with
06:55 - our ripple color and we can really
06:58 - quickly start to see how that looks
06:59 - pretty cool and let's then add that on
07:02 - top of our base color so let's take the
07:05 - output of our base color into an add
07:07 - node let's have the ripples go on top
07:11 - and there we go
07:12 - you can kind of see how we've created
07:14 - this cold looking ripples in the water
07:17 - and if we simply go from the output of
07:20 - an add node into the albedo we can see
07:22 - what that looks like when overlaid onto
07:24 - a plane and that is really the base of
07:27 - our water effect
07:29 - let's also decrease our alpha to
07:31 - something like point eight just to make
07:33 - the border a tiny bit see-through and
07:34 - with that let's try saving this asset
07:37 - and going into unity and voila we
07:41 - actually have some fairly decent looking
07:43 - cartoonish water and everything is done
07:46 - with just these few notes you can of
07:48 - course select the material and try and
07:50 - play around with the base color as well
07:52 - as the ripple color in order to get a
07:55 - nice blend between the two but I
07:57 - actually think that the default settings
07:59 - here are already looking quite fine
08:01 - however one thing that I think is a bit
08:03 - boring is the way that the Voronoi is
08:05 - currently moving it does seem like the
08:07 - water is flowing but it does so very
08:09 - uniformly let's go ahead and add another
08:12 - layer of distortion to this using a
08:15 - radial shear so if we go into our
08:17 - cartoon water here you can see that our
08:19 - bar enoy node has a UV input and this
08:23 - means that we can go ahead and create
08:25 - another node here called the radial
08:27 - shear this is going to go ahead and kind
08:30 - of distort a Voronoi by rotating it
08:32 - around a center point now I'm just gonna
08:35 - set the strength of this to something
08:36 - like one by one but you can see how
08:38 - really quickly that makes the effect
08:40 - much more interesting to look at and if
08:43 - we save that and go straight into unity
08:46 - I think that already looks much much
08:48 - cooler you can definitely play around
08:49 - with adding multiple layers of noise
08:51 - like this to
08:53 - your waters stand out so our water is
08:55 - looking pretty cool now
08:56 - however the plane is still completely
08:58 - flat and as you know water kind of moves
09:02 - around a bit so let's try and add vertex
09:04 - displacement to make this effect more
09:06 - interesting to that that's open up
09:09 - shader graph again and on top of
09:10 - everything we have going on here let's
09:13 - try and create a gradient noise let's go
09:16 - ahead and set the scale of this to
09:18 - something like five you can of course
09:20 - created probably for that if you want
09:22 - and as you can see right now this noise
09:24 - is completely static so let's have it
09:26 - move over time we can do that really
09:29 - easily with a tiling and offset node
09:32 - sets hook that up to the UV of our
09:34 - gradient and as you can see we can now
09:36 - control our noise by simply moving the
09:40 - offset of our tiling an offset node in
09:42 - fact if we go ahead and update this over
09:45 - time so let's add a time node and let's
09:48 - take the output of this time node and
09:50 - it's multiply this so that we can
09:52 - control the speed in fact let's go ahead
09:55 - and create a vector one here let's just
09:57 - call this wave speed let's default it to
10:00 - something like point one let's drag it
10:03 - in hook it up to a multiply node and
10:05 - hook a multiply node up to the offset
10:08 - you can of course control this on the X
10:10 - and the y independently if you want to
10:13 - be able to control the direction but for
10:15 - me I just like it to scroll in any
10:17 - direction here so I'm just gonna go for
10:19 - both at once and as you can see right
10:22 - away the gradient noise is now moving
10:24 - across the screen so this point we can
10:27 - take the gradient noise and we can
10:28 - multiply it into the normal vector of
10:30 - our object in the case of our plane here
10:33 - the normal vector is the vector that
10:35 - points up so if we multiply it into the
10:38 - up vector we can distort the plane on
10:41 - the y axis so to do that we'll simply
10:44 - create a normal vector node and this is
10:47 - going to be in object space and we'll
10:49 - simply multiply this or multiply that
10:52 - with our gradient noise and then we can
10:55 - add that so we'll go into an add node
10:57 - here on top of our current position so
11:00 - on top of the vector position here and
11:03 - that is also in object space so we
11:05 - simply add
11:06 - that on to the normal position and
11:09 - taking the output of that so that it's
11:11 - the distorted position after our waves
11:13 - have been applied and dragging in into
11:16 - the position input of our master node
11:18 - now that is going to go pretty crazy in
11:21 - the preview here I'm just going to go
11:23 - ahead and load in a plane again so we
11:26 - can see this working on an ordinary
11:28 - plane and that looks pretty good if we
11:30 - try and just move this over a bit there
11:33 - we go and save this asset and go into
11:36 - unity we can indeed see how the plane is
11:39 - being shifted on the y axis and our
11:42 - water now looks way more realistic in
11:45 - fact if we go ahead and add another
11:47 - object on top of our water here so I
11:49 - have a tiny rubber duck we can see how
11:52 - the water is kind of shifting up and
11:55 - down this duck yay that looks really
11:58 - cool and that's pretty much it for this
12:00 - water effect now again there are 8,000
12:02 - things that you could do to improve this
12:04 - water you could do reflections and
12:06 - refraction
12:07 - you can add foam whenever the water
12:09 - intersects with objects such as where
12:11 - it's hitting the dark right here
12:13 - in fact you can do that really simply
12:15 - using the same technique as shown in our
12:17 - force field videos so if you haven't
12:19 - seen that definitely check it out and
12:20 - yeah there are just a lot of
12:22 - opportunities for you to customize this
12:24 - and make it your own I definitely
12:25 - encourage you to do so however this
12:28 - should definitely act as a solid base
12:29 - that's pretty much it for this video if
12:32 - you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe

Cleaned transcript:

so one of the requests we get the most is to do a video on how to create water in unity and that's with many things in game development there are about a billion different ways to create water from realistic water with refraction to a more cartoony look of course all these techniques are great if you've been working with unity for a long time and want to pour pun intended a lot of effort into making the perfect water for your game however I think most of us probably just want to get some darn water working so in this video we'll have a look at how to create a water shader in what I think is the simplest possible way this should also helped act as a solid base if you want to look into expanding the effect with stuff like reflections refraction sine based waves or in normal maps but before we get into it this video is sponsored by hosting er if you've ever thought about creating a website or hosting your game on a server I really recommend you check out that different web hosting services they are extremely fast very affordable easy to get started with and provide a lot of value in their different solutions and that website builder will make everything a lot easier for you trust me building a website from scratch can be something else but what makes this really cool for game hosting is that they also offer cloud hosting services which means that you can store your or your users game data in the cloud get 82 percent off for web hosting and a free domain included and use the coupon code practice for an additional 15% simply click the link in the description to get

give our water a base color so let's go to a blackboard and let's add a color let's call it base color let's make this a bright blue something like that let's drag this in and link it to our albedo and right away you can see that our water changes color however having water that is only one color is of course not so interesting so let's go ahead and add some ripples to do this we'll hit space and search for the Voronoi node this is a very interesting type of similar andum noise and it's perfect for ripples since it creates all of these weirdlooking cell that if we distort them a bit we'll look like ripples in water in fact let's try and do that now so if we adjust the angle offset here over time we can get a really interesting effect to do that let's create a time node let's hook this up to a multiply node in order to be able to control the speed of these ripples so that's go ahead and actually create a vector one for this let's call it ripple speed and let's just default it to something like point one drag it in and hook it up to our multiply and let's take the multiply over to our angle offset and right away we can see that they are slowly changing let's go ahead and bump this up to say 1 and we can now see how the different cells are kind of moving around we can also adjust the cell density here that's how many cells are kind of packed together so you can see we can increase or decrease that in fact let's go ahead and create a property to control this so let's again add a new vector 1 let's call this ripple density and let's default it to something like 7 let's drag that in hook it up to our cell density and clean up our graph a bit here there you go the next thing that I want to do is kind of tighten up the edges of our Voronoi currently everything is very blurred together and I'd like to bring out more contrast in the Voronoi in order to really show these lines going across so to do that let's take the output of a Voronoi and plug it into a power node and for the power here let's try and set that to something like 5 and now we really start to see how this looks like ripples in water let's just quickly create a property for this as well so up here and now the vector 1 let's call it let's call it slimness and we can just default it to 5 let's make some space here drag in that ripple slimness and hook it up and I think at this point we're ready to start mixing together or ripples with our base color however in order to do that we probably want to give a ripple some color other than just a solid white so let's again go up here let's create a color property and let's call it ripple color for this one I'm gonna choose as the mode HDR just in order to allow us to control the intensity Ripple's let's set the color to a bit brighter of a blue and let's also give it an intensity of say one we can then take the ripple color and multiply it into the output of our power node so let's go multiply and multiply that with our ripple color and we can really quickly start to see how that looks pretty cool and let's then add that on top of our base color so let's take the output of our base color into an add node let's have the ripples go on top and there we go you can kind of see how we've created this cold looking ripples in the water and if we simply go from the output of an add node into the albedo we can see what that looks like when overlaid onto a plane and that is really the base of our water effect let's also decrease our alpha to something like point eight just to make the border a tiny bit seethrough and with that let's try

let's have it move over time we can do that really easily with a tiling and offset node sets hook that up to the UV of our gradient and as you can see we can now control our noise by simply moving the offset of our tiling an offset node in fact if we go ahead and update this over time so let's add a time node and let's take the output of this time node and it's multiply this so that we can control the speed in fact let's go ahead and create a vector one here let's just call this wave speed let's default it to something like point one let's drag it in hook it up to a multiply node and hook a multiply node up to the offset you can of course control this on the X and the y independently if you want to be able to control the direction but for me I just like it to scroll in any direction here so I'm just gonna go for both at once and as you can see right away the gradient noise is now moving across the screen so this point we can take the gradient noise and we can multiply it into the normal vector of our object in the case of our plane here the normal vector is the vector that points up so if we multiply it into the up vector we can distort the plane on the y axis so to do that we'll simply create a normal vector node and this is going to be in object space and we'll simply multiply this or multiply that with our gradient noise and then we can add that so we'll go into an add node here on top of our current position so on top of the vector position here and that is also in object space so we simply add that on to the normal position and taking the output of that so that it's the distorted position after our waves have been applied and dragging in into the position input of our master node now that is going to go pretty crazy in the preview here I'm just going to go ahead and load in a plane again so we can see this working on an ordinary plane and that looks pretty good if we try and just move this over a bit there we go and save this asset and go into unity we can indeed see how the plane is being shifted on the y axis and our water now looks way more realistic in fact if we go ahead and add another object on top of our water here so I have a tiny rubber duck we can see how the water is kind of shifting up and down this duck yay that looks really cool and that's pretty much it for this water effect now again there are 8,000 things that you could do to improve this water you could do reflections and refraction you can add foam whenever the water intersects with objects such as where it's hitting the dark right here in fact you can do that really simply using the same technique as shown in our force field videos so if you haven't seen that definitely check it out and yeah there are just a lot of opportunities for you to customize this and make it your own I definitely encourage you to do so however this should definitely act as a solid base that's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe and ring that
