00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello everyone never comes to tutorial
00:05 - number 25 in our survival game series
00:08 - Tampa Black Keys I am the CEO of Black
00:11 - Keys and in this video we are gonna take
00:13 - a look at importing the arms for our
00:17 - game I am included some in our survival
00:19 - assets pack which we are going to take a
00:21 - look at in a sec this video is just
00:24 - gonna be about the basic importing and
00:26 - setting things up and then in later
00:28 - videos we're gonna focus on scripting
00:32 - the animation to work with our game and
00:34 - we're gonna do this using the built in
00:36 - unity mecha name system which was
00:39 - introduced in unity 4 okay so let's get
00:44 - started so if you want to use the arms I
00:47 - have made or I've made a part of but
00:51 - we'll talk about that in a sec then you
00:53 - can download the survival assets from
00:55 - our website and if you don't know how to
00:57 - do that then you can of course go ahead
00:59 - and watch our bonus video explaining
01:01 - just that so when you have important and
01:05 - extracted them you should be left with
01:07 - this folder and if we open it up we can
01:10 - go under imports then arms and here you
01:15 - can see a few files I've included both
01:18 - the blender file and an FBX file I
01:22 - recommend you use the FBX file for
01:25 - importing into unity but it's really up
01:27 - to you what you want to use also the
01:30 - texture which is of course UV unwrap so
01:33 - it looked really real here I've included
01:37 - that in both a JPEG format for just
01:40 - importing into unity but also a
01:42 - Photoshop format if you want to create
01:45 - different versions of the texture so you
01:48 - can have a guy with gloves you can have
01:51 - a cloud guy with no gloves you can have
01:53 - darker skin color a wider skin color and
01:55 - so on and then I have a credit text
02:01 - document because I actually didn't
02:03 - create the model for this or the RIC
02:05 - those two things along with one of the
02:08 - animations were made by EAF
02:11 - and you can check them out here and also
02:14 - I have a link to the license that
02:16 - including how you can use this but
02:19 - really all there is to it is that you
02:22 - can use it commercially but you have to
02:24 - credit the author so you have to say
02:27 - that this was made partially by EI FG
02:31 - don't need to mention me at any point
02:34 - but feel free to do so if you want to
02:38 - cool so now we have that out of the way
02:41 - let's go ahead and import this into
02:43 - unity so I have kind of made a I've kind
02:48 - of set up a scene to show you what it is
02:50 - we're going to be creating in the next
02:53 - videos however many that might be so let
02:58 - me just load up that scene and you can
03:01 - see we have the the arms holding a sword
03:06 - and if I go ahead and play the game
03:09 - let's take a look at what we've got so
03:12 - we have some punch animations and it is
03:16 - completely random which one it plays
03:18 - then we have the ability to switch
03:21 - between different weapons so we can
03:23 - switch to this one and then the hands
03:26 - will actually hold the weapon and it
03:29 - will follow us around and now if we
03:31 - attack it plays different swing
03:34 - animations and this can be used with a
03:37 - variety of different weapons we also
03:40 - have some new weapons coming soon
03:43 - so we don't have to use these quite ugly
03:45 - ones I made a back in the day so that's
03:49 - basically what we're going to be making
03:51 - now let's open up our original scene
03:55 - here so you're back to normal and let me
03:58 - just go ahead and explain what it is we
04:01 - are gonna be doing with this painting so
04:04 - again excuse my amazing drawing skills
04:08 - um but but this is basically how every
04:12 - thing works together in unity when it
04:15 - comes to animation and that's what it's
04:16 - really about
04:18 - so we have our play and parented to our
04:23 - play we have our main camera
04:25 - and this this you can see if we open up
04:27 - our play we have the main camera under
04:30 - our main camera we currently have the
04:32 - melee this is something we're gonna
04:34 - attach to a game object in in our arms
04:40 - which have made specifically for this so
04:44 - that we can just parent a weapon to that
04:46 - and then it will follow the animation
04:48 - but that's something we're gonna look at
04:50 - in a second I haven't included it in our
04:54 - painting yet but basically we have the
04:57 - main camera and parented to that we're
04:59 - gonna have the arms so they will follow
05:02 - us around no matter what we do on the
05:05 - arms we have a component called
05:07 - an animator and this animator is what
05:11 - helps us this is what makes the engine
05:15 - include mecanim on the animator we have
05:18 - two things we have an avatar which is
05:21 - which defines how the rig is set up so
05:25 - which bones and which bones are what so
05:29 - basically if we have a hand bone the
05:32 - avatar will help units you figure out
05:34 - that that is a hand and and so if we
05:39 - were using a complete humanoid character
05:42 - so a full character we could also read
05:44 - target animation but that's a bit more
05:46 - advanced then attached to the animator
05:51 - we're gonna have a animated controller
05:53 - and this is what we're gonna use to play
05:57 - animations and blend between them so we
06:02 - are gonna do a little bit of scripting
06:04 - but really most of it is done using the
06:06 - controller so this is just a quick
06:09 - preview of how a controller might look
06:11 - and that's again something we're going
06:13 - to cover later so I won't go into that
06:15 - great so let's import the arms so hit
06:19 - the project pane hit create and then
06:22 - folder and let's call this arms original
06:29 - and then double click that to open it
06:31 - and now we can just drag in the FBX file
06:36 - along with the arms to fuse
06:38 - there you go and this might take a
06:42 - little while sand since it is pretty
06:44 - advanced geometry it is game really
06:47 - still there so now we have the arms five
06:50 - here and you could go ahead and rename
06:52 - that if you want but I'll just leave it
06:53 - if we decide to make new versions in the
06:56 - future and we have our arms diffuse
06:59 - texture the diffuse texture is fine as
07:02 - is so we're not going to play around
07:03 - with that though our arms five we want
07:07 - to change some settings so if we just
07:09 - drag them into a scene you can have a
07:11 - look at how they are now and they are
07:15 - really tiny they are really really tiny
07:19 - so let's go and select them in the
07:22 - project pane and then change up the
07:24 - scale factor let's try 0.4 and this is
07:29 - really just something you have to play
07:31 - around with whenever it comes to
07:33 - animated and rect objects I don't like
07:35 - changing the scale inside of unity I
07:38 - really like only changing the scale
07:40 - factor that looks much better actually
07:45 - um we can go ahead and adjust that once
07:50 - we get him in the view so we'll just
07:52 - leave that for now maybe they need to be
07:54 - a bit bigger no that's fine okay so mesh
08:00 - compression we want that off normal
08:03 - tangents that is import calculate and
08:06 - the material sure we can do that under
08:08 - the rig this is pretty important we
08:11 - won't set this as generic and the root
08:15 - note should be the arm Armagh tree and
08:18 - then master so this one and this will
08:22 - just help unity solve out the animations
08:25 - and help it fade better so that's really
08:28 - important you choose that if you made
08:32 - the rake yourself I'm pretty sure you
08:33 - know what what to pick so let's hit
08:37 - apply on that and it will re importance
08:40 - once again there we go so now we can
08:46 - actually see it is in kind of a battle
08:48 - stands there so that means that the
08:51 - animation
08:51 - is working because this doesn't look all
08:55 - kinds of weird normally you are not in
08:58 - doubt when something is not working so
09:00 - let's hit the enemy and if you don't
09:02 - know what bone it is really just play
09:05 - around with it you can't do anything
09:06 - wrong
09:07 - let's go under the animations tab now so
09:11 - we want to of course import animation
09:14 - and you can just leave these compression
09:17 - and position errors and such as is so
09:21 - the default take I see that's just an
09:25 - idle but not really an idle we want we
09:29 - want the normal idle here and the Iowa
09:32 - with reppin so we can go ahead and exclu
09:35 - exclude this default take it might not
09:38 - be in the blend file actually but let's
09:41 - just exclude it from here so select it
09:43 - and then hit the minus sign so now it
09:47 - know it's gone and all these settings
09:51 - are basically used for defining whether
09:53 - or not an animation should loop and also
09:58 - saying what kind of Clips we have so if
10:03 - you made these animations yourself and
10:06 - didn't create separate actions for them
10:08 - that's what they're called in blender
10:10 - then you might have to go in and define
10:12 - what start and end frame the animations
10:16 - have and that's really just about
10:19 - selecting them and dragging around with
10:21 - these sliders and such okay so let's
10:25 - just preview the different animations so
10:28 - you can see down here we have a preview
10:30 - so I'll just drag that up a bit and drag
10:33 - it out so that looks good and we can
10:38 - change the preview speed up here so
10:40 - let's just make that one and let's have
10:44 - a look at the idle that looks very fine
10:48 - pretty subtle and soon we should start
10:51 - seeing the fingers animating a bit there
10:54 - so that looks good then we have the Idol
10:57 - with with weapon now our hands are
10:59 - closed and we can see that they bounce
11:03 - up and down
11:05 - that doesn't look quite right so it's
11:07 - outside of the range of the soy steak so
11:10 - let hits clam
11:11 - let's hit clamp range that didn't change
11:15 - anything so let's hit lube post and now
11:19 - it looks good awesome let's do the same
11:22 - with the idol so clamp range and Lube
11:25 - pose and now when we skip ahead to the
11:28 - end we can see that it animates
11:31 - beautifully okay let's have a look at
11:34 - the punch left clamp range and that
11:40 - loops perfectly and the punch right
11:44 - climb range that looks good too then we
11:48 - have the run animation clamp range and
11:50 - whose true and remember to loop the pose
11:56 - that looks fine too then we have the
11:59 - swing one clamp range and it loops this
12:06 - swing to clamp range and it looks
12:11 - perfect cool so this was just setting up
12:15 - the import settings now we can go ahead
12:16 - and hit apply and it reinforced
12:25 - asome so what we want to do now is we
12:28 - want to take the arms dragging onto the
12:30 - main camera under the player then maybe
12:34 - cero out the positions and now we can go
12:38 - ahead and drag out the game view here
12:42 - maybe drag it let's see you can go ahead
12:48 - and make it bigger like that make it a
12:51 - separate window and now we can adjust
12:56 - the position of our arms so if we hit
12:59 - play now you can see that doesn't look
13:03 - too bad let's actually go ahead and
13:05 - disable our melee weapon so I'll just
13:07 - drag that back so our melee system here
13:10 - go ahead and disable that let's focus on
13:13 - the arms a bit more we could also get it
13:17 - to play
13:18 - and as
13:18 - animation by default which I think we
13:21 - should do so you can difference the
13:24 - apply weird motion if you're having a
13:28 - problem where the animation just jumps
13:32 - or Wiggles or it's laggy then try
13:36 - unchecking this or checking it back on
13:38 - because there are really still some box
13:41 - with the Meccan em system and that
13:43 - usually helps so you are gonna get a lot
13:48 - of errors or silly things happening
13:50 - really just google it and try to figure
13:54 - it out this is not an easy process okay
13:58 - so the arms 5 now let's create a
14:01 - controller for this and remember the
14:04 - controller is what makes it actually
14:06 - animate so this is what controls the
14:10 - animation and the blending between them
14:12 - so let's go down in the project pane hit
14:15 - the right click hit create and then
14:19 - animated controller and now let's rename
14:24 - this to arms controller and now when we
14:30 - select them in our scene view and drag
14:33 - it in there we go we should be able to
14:36 - double click this arms controller and it
14:39 - will open up the animator let's maximize
14:42 - this and you can always get this by
14:44 - going to window animator I like to have
14:48 - it at the bottom so I can see what we
14:50 - are doing in the top of the view here so
14:54 - now let's just quickly get in an
14:56 - animation here so we can see what is
14:58 - happening let's just throw in the idle
15:00 - on our animator so what we can do is we
15:03 - can go through our project and then open
15:07 - up our arms and you can see the
15:09 - different stuff that is our arms and
15:12 - then we could drag drag in one of these
15:14 - animations so just take the idle for
15:17 - example and drag it in but what I'm
15:19 - going to do instead is go under the anim
15:22 - right click create state MC and a state
15:26 - is really just well it's better to
15:30 - explain it with examples a steak
15:32 - be standing it could be running it could
15:36 - be attacking and such so it's really
15:39 - just what the play is doing right now
15:41 - and so we have an animation to display
15:45 - that so this state is going to be called
15:48 - idle our play isn't doing anything and
15:51 - then the motion that's the animation so
15:55 - let's hit that little button right there
15:57 - and go into the assets and let's find
16:01 - while there are plenty of idle
16:03 - animations there so it's good that we
16:05 - have the path at the button so button so
16:09 - we can see where it comes from and we
16:12 - want the asset arms arms five fpx so
16:15 - that's the one we want uncheck the foot
16:19 - I K and now when we play the game
16:22 - because this is set to default we can
16:25 - see that our arms are playing the idle
16:28 - animation we should however you see this
16:32 - animate we should see a progress bar for
16:35 - that animation and again this is just
16:38 - about unchecking the apply wield motion
16:40 - and now we see it there so you can see
16:43 - how far into the animation we've got
16:47 - cool
16:48 - so that should loop just fine now let's
16:51 - bring in our arms quite a bit something
16:55 - like that that looks a lot better I
17:00 - still think they are quite big in the
17:03 - view whoops so let's maybe bring them
17:06 - down a bit and bring them closer yet and
17:11 - that's much better so let's just
17:14 - maximize this and have a look that looks
17:18 - really nice but this is just preference
17:21 - or like them being in these sides and at
17:23 - the bottom of the view so it doesn't
17:25 - distract the player but really just play
17:28 - around with it until you get something
17:30 - that looks nice let's just have a quick
17:33 - look and see whether or not this loops
17:35 - right so when the blue slider here goes
17:39 - all the way down we should see no
17:41 - bumping it lives just fine
17:45 - cool what we could do now is we could
17:49 - apply the texture to get them looking
17:50 - much better so under our arms we have
17:54 - the arm amateur and this is just all of
17:57 - the different bones and it just extends
18:00 - out almost into infinity then we have
18:04 - the mesh and then we have some objects
18:07 - that are used to control the armature I
18:11 - recommend you leave these be else you're
18:14 - gonna get some oops my phone went off
18:16 - there I recommend you leave these be
18:20 - else you can get some annoying areas in
18:23 - the console saying that they are missing
18:27 - so just leave them okay so if we select
18:30 - our mesh let's go ahead and take a look
18:34 - at the material here and so we can just
18:38 - go ahead and drag on the arms diffuse
18:40 - texture there and change the College
18:43 - completely white so so now we should see
18:47 - the textures working just right that
18:51 - looks really great okay cool so now that
18:57 - that's working I just want to give out
18:59 - some cool tips and tricks because you
19:03 - might experience what is called clipping
19:05 - so if I just move these even closer to
19:09 - the camera like this maybe that's gonna
19:13 - get it oh I'm of the whole camera there
19:15 - so just the arms I'm just gonna try to
19:20 - show an extreme case there we go this is
19:23 - called clipping and this is whenever our
19:26 - mesh goes in within goes within our
19:30 - camera render bounds so right now our
19:34 - arms is too are too close to the camera
19:37 - for it to render to adjust the clipping
19:40 - planes which is exactly this so how near
19:46 - an object can be for the camera to
19:48 - render it we can select the camera and
19:51 - go to the clipping planes and then bump
19:54 - in the near the near variables
19:58 - let's go to something like 0.03 and this
20:03 - is just much better now we can see the
20:05 - whole arm though you might notice it and
20:07 - notice a problem with this we can now
20:09 - see the cylinder that are attached to
20:12 - the player so we can see this cylinder
20:14 - and I would like to keep the cylinder
20:17 - there since it's really nice for just
20:22 - quickly finding the play and so I just
20:25 - want to it to be invisible in-game and
20:28 - to do this let me just undo the position
20:32 - of the arms here so they won't be all
20:35 - weird there you go and then adjust the
20:38 - clipping planes again so serpent zero
20:41 - three to hide this in game what we can
20:45 - do is we can create a separate layer for
20:48 - them so now let's go ahead and select
20:51 - our graphics this is the cylinder and
20:55 - let's go ahead and go to layer and then
20:59 - hit add layer and we're gonna call this
21:03 - player cylinder I've already done this
21:05 - earlier when I wished we're playing
21:09 - around with this so play your cylinder
21:11 - and then go back to the graphics and
21:15 - select the layer so play your cylinder
21:19 - now we can go under the main camera to
21:22 - what's called culling mask which is now
21:24 - set to everything and if we then uncheck
21:28 - the play your cylinder we can see that
21:32 - this cylinder stops drawing in game so
21:35 - now we have it working and we have it
21:38 - positioned and you can also have the
21:40 - arms get as close to the camera as you
21:43 - want so that's basically it for this
21:46 - tutorial guys I hope you enjoyed it this
21:49 - was just getting the arms set up to work
21:51 - in its most basic form in the future
21:54 - we're gonna take a look at animating
21:56 - them and making them work with weapons
21:58 - so look forward to that thank you for
22:01 - watching and I'll see you in the next
22:03 - video
22:04 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone never comes to tutorial number 25 in our survival game series Tampa Black Keys I am the CEO of Black Keys and in this video we are gonna take a look at importing the arms for our game I am included some in our survival assets pack which we are going to take a look at in a sec this video is just gonna be about the basic importing and setting things up and then in later videos we're gonna focus on scripting the animation to work with our game and we're gonna do this using the built in unity mecha name system which was introduced in unity 4 okay so let's get started so if you want to use the arms I have made or I've made a part of but we'll talk about that in a sec then you can download the survival assets from our website and if you don't know how to do that then you can of course go ahead and watch our bonus video explaining just that so when you have important and extracted them you should be left with this folder and if we open it up we can go under imports then arms and here you can see a few files I've included both the blender file and an FBX file I recommend you use the FBX file for importing into unity but it's really up to you what you want to use also the texture which is of course UV unwrap so it looked really real here I've included that in both a JPEG format for just importing into unity but also a Photoshop format if you want to create different versions of the texture so you can have a guy with gloves you can have a cloud guy with no gloves you can have darker skin color a wider skin color and so on and then I have a credit text document because I actually didn't create the model for this or the RIC those two things along with one of the animations were made by EAF and you can check them out here and also I have a link to the license that including how you can use this but really all there is to it is that you can use it commercially but you have to credit the author so you have to say that this was made partially by EI FG don't need to mention me at any point but feel free to do so if you want to cool so now we have that out of the way let's go ahead and import this into unity so I have kind of made a I've kind of set up a scene to show you what it is we're going to be creating in the next videos however many that might be so let me just load up that scene and you can see we have the the arms holding a sword and if I go ahead and play the game let's take a look at what we've got so we have some punch animations and it is completely random which one it plays then we have the ability to switch between different weapons so we can switch to this one and then the hands will actually hold the weapon and it will follow us around and now if we attack it plays different swing animations and this can be used with a variety of different weapons we also have some new weapons coming soon so we don't have to use these quite ugly ones I made a back in the day so that's basically what we're going to be making now let's open up our original scene here so you're back to normal and let me just go ahead and explain what it is we are gonna be doing with this painting so again excuse my amazing drawing skills um but but this is basically how every thing works together in unity when it comes to animation and that's what it's really about so we have our play and parented to our play we have our main camera and this this you can see if we open up our play we have the main camera under our main camera we currently have the melee this is something we're gonna attach to a game object in in our arms which have made specifically for this so that we can just parent a weapon to that and then it will follow the animation but that's something we're gonna look at in a second I haven't included it in our painting yet but basically we have the main camera and parented to that we're gonna have the arms so they will follow us around no matter what we do on the arms we have a component called an animator and this animator is what helps us this is what makes the engine include mecanim on the animator we have two things we have an avatar which is which defines how the rig is set up so which bones and which bones are what so basically if we have a hand bone the avatar will help units you figure out that that is a hand and and so if we were using a complete humanoid character so a full character we could also read target animation but that's a bit more advanced then attached to the animator we're gonna have a animated controller and this is what we're gonna use to play animations and blend between them so we are gonna do a little bit of scripting but really most of it is done using the controller so this is just a quick preview of how a controller might look and that's again something we're going to cover later so I won't go into that great so let's import the arms so hit the project pane hit create and then folder and let's call this arms original and then double click that to open it and now we can just drag in the FBX file along with the arms to fuse there you go and this might take a little while sand since it is pretty advanced geometry it is game really still there so now we have the arms five here and you could go ahead and rename that if you want but I'll just leave it if we decide to make new versions in the future and we have our arms diffuse texture the diffuse texture is fine as is so we're not going to play around with that though our arms five we want to change some settings so if we just drag them into a scene you can have a look at how they are now and they are really tiny they are really really tiny so let's go and select them in the project pane and then change up the scale factor let's try 0.4 and this is really just something you have to play around with whenever it comes to animated and rect objects I don't like changing the scale inside of unity I really like only changing the scale factor that looks much better actually um we can go ahead and adjust that once we get him in the view so we'll just leave that for now maybe they need to be a bit bigger no that's fine okay so mesh compression we want that off normal tangents that is import calculate and the material sure we can do that under the rig this is pretty important we won't set this as generic and the root note should be the arm Armagh tree and then master so this one and this will just help unity solve out the animations and help it fade better so that's really important you choose that if you made the rake yourself I'm pretty sure you know what what to pick so let's hit apply on that and it will re importance once again there we go so now we can actually see it is in kind of a battle stands there so that means that the animation is working because this doesn't look all kinds of weird normally you are not in doubt when something is not working so let's hit the enemy and if you don't know what bone it is really just play around with it you can't do anything wrong let's go under the animations tab now so we want to of course import animation and you can just leave these compression and position errors and such as is so the default take I see that's just an idle but not really an idle we want we want the normal idle here and the Iowa with reppin so we can go ahead and exclu exclude this default take it might not be in the blend file actually but let's just exclude it from here so select it and then hit the minus sign so now it know it's gone and all these settings are basically used for defining whether or not an animation should loop and also saying what kind of Clips we have so if you made these animations yourself and didn't create separate actions for them that's what they're called in blender then you might have to go in and define what start and end frame the animations have and that's really just about selecting them and dragging around with these sliders and such okay so let's just preview the different animations so you can see down here we have a preview so I'll just drag that up a bit and drag it out so that looks good and we can change the preview speed up here so let's just make that one and let's have a look at the idle that looks very fine pretty subtle and soon we should start seeing the fingers animating a bit there so that looks good then we have the Idol with with weapon now our hands are closed and we can see that they bounce up and down that doesn't look quite right so it's outside of the range of the soy steak so let hits clam let's hit clamp range that didn't change anything so let's hit lube post and now it looks good awesome let's do the same with the idol so clamp range and Lube pose and now when we skip ahead to the end we can see that it animates beautifully okay let's have a look at the punch left clamp range and that loops perfectly and the punch right climb range that looks good too then we have the run animation clamp range and whose true and remember to loop the pose that looks fine too then we have the swing one clamp range and it loops this swing to clamp range and it looks perfect cool so this was just setting up the import settings now we can go ahead and hit apply and it reinforced asome so what we want to do now is we want to take the arms dragging onto the main camera under the player then maybe cero out the positions and now we can go ahead and drag out the game view here maybe drag it let's see you can go ahead and make it bigger like that make it a separate window and now we can adjust the position of our arms so if we hit play now you can see that doesn't look too bad let's actually go ahead and disable our melee weapon so I'll just drag that back so our melee system here go ahead and disable that let's focus on the arms a bit more we could also get it to play and as animation by default which I think we should do so you can difference the apply weird motion if you're having a problem where the animation just jumps or Wiggles or it's laggy then try unchecking this or checking it back on because there are really still some box with the Meccan em system and that usually helps so you are gonna get a lot of errors or silly things happening really just google it and try to figure it out this is not an easy process okay so the arms 5 now let's create a controller for this and remember the controller is what makes it actually animate so this is what controls the animation and the blending between them so let's go down in the project pane hit the right click hit create and then animated controller and now let's rename this to arms controller and now when we select them in our scene view and drag it in there we go we should be able to double click this arms controller and it will open up the animator let's maximize this and you can always get this by going to window animator I like to have it at the bottom so I can see what we are doing in the top of the view here so now let's just quickly get in an animation here so we can see what is happening let's just throw in the idle on our animator so what we can do is we can go through our project and then open up our arms and you can see the different stuff that is our arms and then we could drag drag in one of these animations so just take the idle for example and drag it in but what I'm going to do instead is go under the anim right click create state MC and a state is really just well it's better to explain it with examples a steak be standing it could be running it could be attacking and such so it's really just what the play is doing right now and so we have an animation to display that so this state is going to be called idle our play isn't doing anything and then the motion that's the animation so let's hit that little button right there and go into the assets and let's find while there are plenty of idle animations there so it's good that we have the path at the button so button so we can see where it comes from and we want the asset arms arms five fpx so that's the one we want uncheck the foot I K and now when we play the game because this is set to default we can see that our arms are playing the idle animation we should however you see this animate we should see a progress bar for that animation and again this is just about unchecking the apply wield motion and now we see it there so you can see how far into the animation we've got cool so that should loop just fine now let's bring in our arms quite a bit something like that that looks a lot better I still think they are quite big in the view whoops so let's maybe bring them down a bit and bring them closer yet and that's much better so let's just maximize this and have a look that looks really nice but this is just preference or like them being in these sides and at the bottom of the view so it doesn't distract the player but really just play around with it until you get something that looks nice let's just have a quick look and see whether or not this loops right so when the blue slider here goes all the way down we should see no bumping it lives just fine cool what we could do now is we could apply the texture to get them looking much better so under our arms we have the arm amateur and this is just all of the different bones and it just extends out almost into infinity then we have the mesh and then we have some objects that are used to control the armature I recommend you leave these be else you're gonna get some oops my phone went off there I recommend you leave these be else you can get some annoying areas in the console saying that they are missing so just leave them okay so if we select our mesh let's go ahead and take a look at the material here and so we can just go ahead and drag on the arms diffuse texture there and change the College completely white so so now we should see the textures working just right that looks really great okay cool so now that that's working I just want to give out some cool tips and tricks because you might experience what is called clipping so if I just move these even closer to the camera like this maybe that's gonna get it oh I'm of the whole camera there so just the arms I'm just gonna try to show an extreme case there we go this is called clipping and this is whenever our mesh goes in within goes within our camera render bounds so right now our arms is too are too close to the camera for it to render to adjust the clipping planes which is exactly this so how near an object can be for the camera to render it we can select the camera and go to the clipping planes and then bump in the near the near variables let's go to something like 0.03 and this is just much better now we can see the whole arm though you might notice it and notice a problem with this we can now see the cylinder that are attached to the player so we can see this cylinder and I would like to keep the cylinder there since it's really nice for just quickly finding the play and so I just want to it to be invisible ingame and to do this let me just undo the position of the arms here so they won't be all weird there you go and then adjust the clipping planes again so serpent zero three to hide this in game what we can do is we can create a separate layer for them so now let's go ahead and select our graphics this is the cylinder and let's go ahead and go to layer and then hit add layer and we're gonna call this player cylinder I've already done this earlier when I wished we're playing around with this so play your cylinder and then go back to the graphics and select the layer so play your cylinder now we can go under the main camera to what's called culling mask which is now set to everything and if we then uncheck the play your cylinder we can see that this cylinder stops drawing in game so now we have it working and we have it positioned and you can also have the arms get as close to the camera as you want so that's basically it for this tutorial guys I hope you enjoyed it this was just getting the arms set up to work in its most basic form in the future we're gonna take a look at animating them and making them work with weapons so look forward to that thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video
