00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - video number 24 in make a game a cool
00:08 - series on making a video game in unity
00:11 - so this video is called uh finishing up
00:15 - and it's not going to be the very last
00:16 - video in the series because I want to do
00:19 - a couple of videos at least on uh
00:21 - building your game and exporting to
00:24 - different
00:25 - platforms but I also wanted to do this
00:28 - video that just uh took care of some
00:30 - loose ends and just uh polished the
00:33 - result a little bit so the stuff that we
00:35 - are going to be doing today is first off
00:38 - we are going to just adjust the controls
00:40 - because I think that they are uh a bit
00:43 - uh annoying at the moment then we're
00:46 - going to create an enemy death sound and
00:48 - that's going to be pretty much a power
00:49 - up sound of some sorts then we just
00:52 - going to quickly do some organization
00:54 - and finally we're going to add an icon
00:56 - to our game and uh the software that I'm
00:59 - going to be using for this is Photoshop
01:01 - because that's what I'm most familiar
01:02 - with uh but pretty much you can use any
01:05 - kind of 2D editing software like
01:08 - which is free or you could even go ahead
01:11 - and download a UPA
01:14 - toolkit um from the unity asset store
01:17 - it's an asset by uh me uh which allows
01:20 - you to create pixel art really easily
01:22 - inside of unity so if you wanted to make
01:24 - a cool pixel out logo you could uh use
01:27 - that cool so um but the things I'm going
01:30 - to explaining be explaining are pretty
01:32 - General and I will also provide you with
01:34 - the finished icon if you don't want to
01:36 - make one
01:38 - yourself awesome uh so as always if you
01:41 - have any question throughout the video
01:42 - go to fm. bra.com and now that we've set
01:45 - all that let's just get started with
01:47 - today's video don't mind me using the uh
01:50 - Pro skin uh everything is still going to
01:52 - apply to
01:54 - you okay so first uh thing on the list
01:58 - here is uh controlls so uh if I just go
02:01 - ahead and play the game right now and
02:03 - just turn off my monitors here so the
02:05 - music Don't doesn't feed into my
02:08 - microphone uh you can see that our we
02:10 - have a working menu with a music slide
02:12 - and all that if we hit play game we can
02:15 - play through the game and I've just made
02:17 - some very few adjustments I've simply uh
02:20 - pulled apart the platforms a bit so the
02:22 - uh character doesn't get stuck between
02:25 - them and also uh you can see here if we
02:29 - just complete this
02:31 - level I've uh made a second one and
02:34 - that's simply using all of the same uh
02:36 - assets uh just one enemy we have some
02:41 - coins placed in different places and uh
02:43 - all I've done with this platform here
02:46 - simply rotated uh it a bit around the uh
02:49 - z-axis that must be and whoops it looks
02:52 - like I didn't complete it there but if
02:54 - uh and you can see I've plac placed a um
02:57 - if we go into level two here a
02:58 - checkpoint right there and uh if you get
03:01 - down there it simply takes you to the
03:02 - end level uh scene which of course
03:06 - displays our
03:07 - score cool so that's uh basically all
03:11 - there is to uh the game right now and
03:14 - you can of course expand on this but I
03:16 - think that's going to be the finished
03:17 - dat uh that uh I'm going to export my
03:21 - build
03:22 - in uh or my gameing so let's uh start
03:25 - out by just adjusting these controls so
03:28 - if we go under the ball and go under the
03:30 - ball control script I first off want to
03:33 - kind of make the controls more Snappy
03:36 - and a pretty easy way to do this is bump
03:39 - up the angular drag angular drag is
03:41 - basically the resistance on your
03:43 - rotational movement so if we bump this
03:46 - up all the way to 10 and then increase
03:49 - our rotation speed to uh be 10 folds
03:52 - which is
03:54 - 2,000 uh and then bump up the mass to
03:57 - two we're going to get a lot L of
04:00 - resistance and a lot of uh we're going
04:02 - to need a lot of power in order to
04:04 - rotate the rigid body but once we have
04:06 - that power um it's uh going to feel a
04:10 - lot more uh Snappy we're going to uh
04:12 - accelerate quicker uh more quickly and
04:16 - uh we're going to be able to uh change
04:18 - direction more quickly so you can see
04:20 - here what that does and it actually
04:22 - makes it a lot more fun to play because
04:25 - now you actually have a chance uh in
04:27 - controlling whether or not you hit an
04:31 - enemy cool uh so that was the first
04:34 - thing uh next up is the enemy death
04:36 - sound so if you haven't already you can
04:38 - download the uh make aame assets from
04:41 - bra.com
04:43 - and uh I'm just quickly going to show
04:45 - you how to do that so of course
04:48 - breast.com simply go there go under
04:52 - projects select make a
04:55 - game and simply download the scripts and
04:57 - assets right there
05:01 - cool and once those are downloaded it's
05:03 - simply a zip file so you should be able
05:05 - to open it without an extractor or if
05:08 - you have issues you can use WinRAR then
05:11 - we go under audio and I've made this uh
05:13 - or I've found this power up file um from
05:17 - freesound.org and I've made sure that
05:19 - the license is creative common zero so
05:22 - you can use it in any way you wish also
05:24 - for commercial uh projects so if I just
05:27 - uh play this quickly
05:32 - uh wait a second let me just turn on my
05:34 - monitors here there we
05:37 - go so it's kind of this uh rewarding
05:40 - sound uh that the player should hear
05:43 - when he uh kills an enemy so let's load
05:46 - that into our game so simply drag it and
05:49 - uh hover over unity and simply uh drop
05:51 - it under the audio folder and it should
05:54 - rest in here uh so we can find the Power
05:57 - Up Sound there
06:00 - uh and what we basically want to do here
06:02 - is um find our enemy object the enemy
06:07 - Center
06:07 - here and uh well this gets deleted the
06:11 - second uh that we uh killed the enemy if
06:14 - I I'm correct here so let's check that
06:17 - out look in the hierarchy over here
06:20 - actually it doesn't so that's perfect or
06:23 - remember we did the death animation and
06:24 - all that so uh all we need to do is
06:27 - basically just attach a audio source
06:32 - here and drag in the oops what's the no
06:37 - reference let's double click uh that to
06:39 - open it up in uh in what should be my
06:42 - not develop I see that I've still
06:44 - configured this with the visual studio
06:46 - so I'm just going to change this in uh
06:50 - the edit project
06:54 - nope preferences external tools I
06:57 - quickly just switch that to mon no
07:01 - cool so let's try and open that in mono
07:03 - develop and see what this error is all
07:14 - about cool so it's trying to restart our
07:18 - level but apparently it cannot find the
07:20 - game
07:21 - master is what it looks like so we'll
07:24 - simply say that
07:27 - if game
07:30 - uh if game
07:33 - master is not equal to
07:37 - null then we want to restart our
07:42 - level and this is a very handy thing
07:44 - that a lot of people don't know if you
07:45 - hold done alt and press up and down you
07:48 - can move lines like that so that's uh
07:52 - super useful so let's try that again
07:56 - uh I'm just going to jump on him
08:01 - there we
08:02 - go so now we don't have any
08:05 - issues okay so um basically what we want
08:08 - to do is reenable this audio source and
08:11 - uh we can drag in the power up clip and
08:14 - uh the audio is just going to be the uh
08:16 - is is not going to be anything in
08:18 - particular uh we don't need any control
08:20 - over this and uh the volume we're going
08:23 - to have to see about that so uh
08:25 - basically Let's uh uncheck play on awake
08:28 - and let's find a way to trigger this
08:30 - sound so let's double click on the enemy
08:32 - and add some code onto this so let's uh
08:36 - start by making a uh reference so uh
08:40 - death particles we're also going to make
08:43 - a VAR death sound of type audio
08:48 - Source um yeah that's perfect and uh
08:52 - then under the uh die method uh we want
08:55 - to instantiate death particles and we
08:58 - want to say death sound. playay and this
09:03 - takes in a parameter if you want but
09:05 - that's a delay in samples so that's not
09:07 - something we're going to be
09:09 - needing uh cool and now we can simply
09:11 - drag this audio sour in there and
09:16 - everything should be working you uh want
09:18 - to make sure to set the spatial blend to
09:21 - 2D uh if you want it to uh play as
09:24 - normal uh but if you want that 3D sound
09:27 - sense of direction uh
09:29 - then you can of course use the slider I
09:32 - want this to be entirely
09:33 - 2D so let's try
09:35 - [Music]
09:41 - that that's perfect I didn't want this
09:44 - huge sound just a small one to indicate
09:46 - that we've done something great okay so
09:49 - uh let's now just hit apply on that and
09:52 - all those settings should save and we
09:54 - can also hit apply uh on our ball if we
09:57 - didn't do that before which I don't
09:59 - think we
10:00 - did so we are speeding through these
10:03 - points today the next up is organization
10:05 - because I want this uh project to look a
10:07 - bit more needy uh so let's take our
10:09 - current score destructible down hit
10:11 - endpoint enemy final score and kill on
10:13 - hit scripts and drag them under the
10:15 - scripts folder let's also make a scenes
10:18 - folder so let's create a folder called
10:22 - scenes and drag in our levels and our
10:24 - main
10:26 - menu and next up we have these two
10:29 - materials so let's drag them under the
10:32 - materials
10:33 - folder great so now everything is just
10:37 - as it should be one thing I like to do
10:39 - is I like to have the opening scene
10:41 - which would be our main menu in the root
10:44 - assets folder this way people know what
10:46 - to click if they uh download the project
10:49 - and want to start from the very
10:51 - beginning next up we go under uh file
10:54 - build settings and make sure that all of
10:56 - your scenes are in the build settings
11:00 - that's very
11:01 - important cool so the final thing that
11:04 - we need to do is just creating an icon
11:07 - so uh let's do this um we could use
11:09 - several assets from the game in creating
11:12 - this icon uh for example we could use uh
11:15 - this guy uh but since this guy is
11:17 - modeled after a Mario character that
11:20 - might be a bit too much uh so we could
11:22 - use the ball here but I really like the
11:24 - look of our coin right now so let's
11:27 - actually snap take a snapshot of that so
11:33 - um let's just temporarily disable
11:36 - everything but that uh coin that is in
11:39 - the frame so let's disable uh the ball
11:43 - let's disable the platform
11:46 - to there we go uh now we can go in here
11:50 - and we can turn off the Sky Box using
11:53 - this button here we want the lighting to
11:56 - be on because I like the uh lighting
11:58 - effect that comes from uh the sun being
12:01 - high heightened a
12:03 - bit and uh then we can turn off all of
12:06 - these gizmos that are also in the way we
12:09 - could uh do 3D uh icons and just size
12:13 - them all the way down which I think is
12:15 - what we're going to do we can also turn
12:18 - off the grid and now we actually have a
12:21 - clean background uh to use so let's just
12:26 - zoom in on this might as well get get a
12:28 - pretty HD uh picture you can also full
12:31 - screen this by using shift space which
12:34 - I'm going to do and you will notice that
12:36 - it is U uh clear that this is a fairly
12:40 - low poly object uh but I think that will
12:44 - be fine for our case so now let's go
12:46 - under our Snipping Tool uh some kind of
12:51 - uh or uh Windows uses the Snipping tool
12:54 - for screenshots on Mac this would be
12:56 - command Shift 4
12:59 - uh in order to take a screenshot where
13:01 - you can uh select part of the screen as
13:04 - um as the uh image you want to take
13:08 - whoops whoa I did something crazy there
13:10 - so let's Zoom back in on the
13:16 - coin and we need to find a good
13:19 - angle I think we want it kind of from
13:21 - the side here so something like that
13:24 - looks fairly decent and uh whoops
13:29 - Jesus Christ what why does it keep doing
13:32 - that so let's try and zoom in on the
13:33 - coin here let's do this one last time I
13:36 - think I I hit some kind of mouse button
13:38 - there okay so let's take the Snipping
13:40 - Tool again command Shift 4 in the Mac
13:42 - let's hit new and let's just drag around
13:46 - this fine now let's uh save this
13:51 - as coin you can just save it on the
13:54 - desktop so
13:55 - far and uh let's open up Photoshop
14:08 - and just clean up my desktop here a
14:12 - bit cool so uh basically all we're going
14:15 - to do is we're going to create uh a new
14:19 - image and I like to make this uh much
14:22 - larer larger than it needs to be let's
14:25 - do 1920 by 1920 or uh actually
14:29 - 1080 by 1080 it's going to be fine and
14:34 - we're going to call this the make a game
14:37 - logo or
14:40 - icon and uh let's just hit
14:44 - okay it's going to create this image now
14:47 - let's double click on the background
14:49 - rename this to BG and uh let's drag in
14:52 - our
14:56 - coin cool let's scale up this coin
14:59 - and uh let's now remove this ugly
15:02 - looking background so uh we can just use
15:04 - the magic War to do this let's just see
15:07 - how that looks uh first click to make a
15:09 - selection this then press uh control
15:13 - shift I to invert that selection and
15:16 - then uh click on the mask down here the
15:19 - layer mask and it will mask away all
15:22 - that so that actually looks fairly good
15:26 - and uh we could
15:29 - do some more stuff with this I think
15:32 - that we should maybe uh do some kind of
15:35 - uh background for this so uh let's go
15:38 - ahead and create a rounded rectangle
15:41 - Tool uh let's select a color for this
15:44 - and maybe some kind of Deep Blue could
15:47 - be fun here uh let's round the corners a
15:50 - bit more than uh 10 pixels let's try 40
15:55 - pixels and let's try and drag this by
15:59 - pressing in the center then holding
16:01 - shift and
16:03 - ALT something like uh this then let's
16:06 - Center this both this and the coin uh by
16:11 - uh pressing control and then clicking on
16:13 - the BG here that will select our entire
16:16 - screen we could also just uh use the
16:18 - rectangular Mark tool here and just uh
16:22 - Mark everything off and uh then we want
16:25 - to select this rounded rectangle go
16:28 - under
16:29 - uh layer align layers to selection
16:32 - vertical centers and layer align uh
16:35 - layers to selection horizontal
16:39 - centers and uh we'll do the same thing
16:42 - with our coin so let's just drag this
16:44 - under our coin image or layer align
16:48 - layers to selection vertical layer align
16:51 - layers to selection horizontal just to
16:53 - make sure that it's in the center now we
16:56 - can uh scale this up to fit our
17:01 - entire
17:05 - screen cool and uh let's see what do we
17:09 - want to do with this uh you can see here
17:12 - that the mask hasn't been perfect so
17:14 - let's just make sure to delete simply
17:17 - select the mask over here then hit M
17:20 - select all of this and just delete that
17:24 - just to make
17:26 - sure that we don't have any ugly edges
17:29 - is once we export this uh maybe it would
17:33 - have been a good idea to like increase
17:35 - the radius on this to something uh more
17:39 - um but I think for now we're just going
17:40 - to stick with uh the 40 here I'm doing
17:44 - this fairly quickly just to demonstrate
17:46 - how uh you would go about doing this so
17:49 - we can play around with uh some
17:50 - different uh colors here I kind of like
17:53 - this light blue which is also kind of a
17:56 - a um uh theme color for the Mega game
18:00 - series so let's just stick with that uh
18:04 - and we can maybe do some kind of cool
18:06 - looking Edge on this so let's duplicate
18:08 - the rounded rectangle and just drag it
18:11 - in a bit and uh let's make this uh
18:18 - darker and still give it a bit of
18:22 - blue I'll show you something cool you
18:24 - can do with this just in a moment and
18:26 - then we can double click this
18:29 - and select inner
18:32 - Shadow and bump up the size on
18:35 - this and that really adds some depth to
18:39 - the picture and now we can just change
18:41 - the uh color of our edge here because I
18:44 - want it to be kind of more
18:48 - bright that is pretty fine I want the
18:51 - edge to be
18:53 - larger because the icon is going to be
18:56 - fairly
18:57 - small and we can also give the coin here
19:00 - a drop shadow so drop shadow on that
19:04 - size it up a
19:07 - bit that looks fairly nice we could also
19:09 - make it Glow if we wanted to but I think
19:11 - we are just going to uh not uh we could
19:15 - also add a bevel to the outside here but
19:19 - I think that's going to be a uh bit too
19:22 - much uh however it would be pretty nice
19:25 - to add some kind of uh gradient to that
19:27 - so let's go under gradient
19:29 - overlay and let's change this to
19:33 - luminosity and let's actually let's
19:36 - change this to Overlay instead and let's
19:38 - bump down the opacity quite a bit on
19:43 - that so something like this looks like a
19:46 - pretty cool icon it's very simple and
19:48 - easy to just take an uh element from
19:50 - your game which you think is pretty
19:52 - Central and then just kind of make a
19:54 - background for it and whoops you have an
19:56 - icon so I think we're just going to
19:58 - stick with this it's not perfect um but
20:02 - I think it will be pretty good for now
20:05 - so let's uh go under file save as let's
20:09 - locate our project folder uh actually
20:12 - I'm just going to save this into our um
20:16 - our asset pack so uh let's go under Mac
20:19 - assets here uh let's go under um
20:23 - textures I guess I really want this to
20:27 - be named images Maybe actually let's
20:29 - just save this in the root folder so
20:30 - make a game Icon and this is going to be
20:33 - the PSD
20:36 - version save and also we'll make a JPEG
20:40 - version uh for those of you who have not
20:43 - uh who don't have uh Photoshop
20:46 - installed and uh now we can simply open
20:49 - up Unity we can go and uh simply drag
20:53 - these into the RO root folder of unity
20:56 - uh so I'm simply going to uh you know
20:58 - discard my changes to the scene go on
21:01 - the main menu and hit don't save because
21:03 - we don't want to save those changes and
21:05 - we can go back in and enable all of the
21:08 - gizmos
21:10 - here and show the grid again and whoops
21:14 - we are back and uh let's just go under
21:17 - the Mac assets let's go and drag in I'm
21:20 - just going to drag in the
21:22 - pstd in a unity and you can see it
21:25 - Imports the icon nicely we then going to
21:29 - change this from texture to uh
21:33 - Sprite and uh you can basically leave
21:37 - all of these we want the filter mode to
21:38 - be bilinear you could do trilinear and
21:41 - we want it to be true color and a
21:44 - maximum of
21:46 - 248 just perfect hit apply on that and
21:50 - uh now we can go and uh simply insert
21:53 - this into our build uh settings so if
21:56 - you go on the build settings select the
21:58 - platform you want go under player
22:00 - settings uh you can see that we can
22:02 - change this to this company name is
22:06 - braies the product name is make a game
22:10 - and uh you can simply drag in the
22:12 - default icon and you can see it scale
22:15 - here so once you build this and um I'm
22:18 - just going to do a quick test build hope
22:20 - that this U works out or I'm going to go
22:23 - into depth
22:24 - uh way more depth with the build
22:27 - settings uh in some of the next videos
22:29 - but now let's just build this
22:32 - into uh the desk into
22:36 - um find the Dropbox here um
22:40 - mag make a game and let's create a
22:45 - separate folder here called
22:48 - builds and let's call this test
22:52 - build it's going to save
22:56 - that and it's going to start
22:59 - building okay so it's done building and
23:02 - uh you can see that window sometimes has
23:05 - this weird bug where it shows the icon
23:07 - at really low resolution uh but I find
23:10 - that sometimes if you just move it from
23:12 - one folder to another it refreshes and
23:14 - other times you have to restart and uh
23:17 - that's I don't know it's some weirdness
23:20 - uh but we're going to look into making
23:21 - it into an installable and all that in
23:25 - another video but just for now if we
23:27 - hold down control and zoom in on this we
23:30 - can see that it's actually pretty high
23:32 - resolution and that it looks really
23:34 - nicely and if we open that it's of
23:36 - course going to start up the
23:38 - game cool so that was basically all for
23:42 - this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'm
23:44 - looking forward to finally building our
23:46 - game uh uh properly in the next video so
23:50 - thanks for watching and I hope you
23:52 - enjoyed it
24:00 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to video number 24 in make a game a cool series on making a video game in unity so this video is called uh finishing up and it's not going to be the very last video in the series because I want to do a couple of videos at least on uh building your game and exporting to different platforms but I also wanted to do this video that just uh took care of some loose ends and just uh polished the result a little bit so the stuff that we are going to be doing today is first off we are going to just adjust the controls because I think that they are uh a bit uh annoying at the moment then we're going to create an enemy death sound and that's going to be pretty much a power up sound of some sorts then we just going to quickly do some organization and finally we're going to add an icon to our game and uh the software that I'm going to be using for this is Photoshop because that's what I'm most familiar with uh but pretty much you can use any kind of 2D editing software like which is free or you could even go ahead and download a UPA toolkit um from the unity asset store it's an asset by uh me uh which allows you to create pixel art really easily inside of unity so if you wanted to make a cool pixel out logo you could uh use that cool so um but the things I'm going to explaining be explaining are pretty General and I will also provide you with the finished icon if you don't want to make one yourself awesome uh so as always if you have any question throughout the video go to fm. bra.com and now that we've set all that let's just get started with today's video don't mind me using the uh Pro skin uh everything is still going to apply to you okay so first uh thing on the list here is uh controlls so uh if I just go ahead and play the game right now and just turn off my monitors here so the music Don't doesn't feed into my microphone uh you can see that our we have a working menu with a music slide and all that if we hit play game we can play through the game and I've just made some very few adjustments I've simply uh pulled apart the platforms a bit so the uh character doesn't get stuck between them and also uh you can see here if we just complete this level I've uh made a second one and that's simply using all of the same uh assets uh just one enemy we have some coins placed in different places and uh all I've done with this platform here simply rotated uh it a bit around the uh zaxis that must be and whoops it looks like I didn't complete it there but if uh and you can see I've plac placed a um if we go into level two here a checkpoint right there and uh if you get down there it simply takes you to the end level uh scene which of course displays our score cool so that's uh basically all there is to uh the game right now and you can of course expand on this but I think that's going to be the finished dat uh that uh I'm going to export my build in uh or my gameing so let's uh start out by just adjusting these controls so if we go under the ball and go under the ball control script I first off want to kind of make the controls more Snappy and a pretty easy way to do this is bump up the angular drag angular drag is basically the resistance on your rotational movement so if we bump this up all the way to 10 and then increase our rotation speed to uh be 10 folds which is 2,000 uh and then bump up the mass to two we're going to get a lot L of resistance and a lot of uh we're going to need a lot of power in order to rotate the rigid body but once we have that power um it's uh going to feel a lot more uh Snappy we're going to uh accelerate quicker uh more quickly and uh we're going to be able to uh change direction more quickly so you can see here what that does and it actually makes it a lot more fun to play because now you actually have a chance uh in controlling whether or not you hit an enemy cool uh so that was the first thing uh next up is the enemy death sound so if you haven't already you can download the uh make aame assets from bra.com and uh I'm just quickly going to show you how to do that so of course breast.com simply go there go under projects select make a game and simply download the scripts and assets right there cool and once those are downloaded it's simply a zip file so you should be able to open it without an extractor or if you have issues you can use WinRAR then we go under audio and I've made this uh or I've found this power up file um from freesound.org and I've made sure that the license is creative common zero so you can use it in any way you wish also for commercial uh projects so if I just uh play this quickly uh wait a second let me just turn on my monitors here there we go so it's kind of this uh rewarding sound uh that the player should hear when he uh kills an enemy so let's load that into our game so simply drag it and uh hover over unity and simply uh drop it under the audio folder and it should rest in here uh so we can find the Power Up Sound there uh and what we basically want to do here is um find our enemy object the enemy Center here and uh well this gets deleted the second uh that we uh killed the enemy if I I'm correct here so let's check that out look in the hierarchy over here actually it doesn't so that's perfect or remember we did the death animation and all that so uh all we need to do is basically just attach a audio source here and drag in the oops what's the no reference let's double click uh that to open it up in uh in what should be my not develop I see that I've still configured this with the visual studio so I'm just going to change this in uh the edit project nope preferences external tools I quickly just switch that to mon no cool so let's try and open that in mono develop and see what this error is all about cool so it's trying to restart our level but apparently it cannot find the game master is what it looks like so we'll simply say that if game uh if game master is not equal to null then we want to restart our level and this is a very handy thing that a lot of people don't know if you hold done alt and press up and down you can move lines like that so that's uh super useful so let's try that again uh I'm just going to jump on him there we go so now we don't have any issues okay so um basically what we want to do is reenable this audio source and uh we can drag in the power up clip and uh the audio is just going to be the uh is is not going to be anything in particular uh we don't need any control over this and uh the volume we're going to have to see about that so uh basically Let's uh uncheck play on awake and let's find a way to trigger this sound so let's double click on the enemy and add some code onto this so let's uh start by making a uh reference so uh death particles we're also going to make a VAR death sound of type audio Source um yeah that's perfect and uh then under the uh die method uh we want to instantiate death particles and we want to say death sound. playay and this takes in a parameter if you want but that's a delay in samples so that's not something we're going to be needing uh cool and now we can simply drag this audio sour in there and everything should be working you uh want to make sure to set the spatial blend to 2D uh if you want it to uh play as normal uh but if you want that 3D sound sense of direction uh then you can of course use the slider I want this to be entirely 2D so let's try that that's perfect I didn't want this huge sound just a small one to indicate that we've done something great okay so uh let's now just hit apply on that and all those settings should save and we can also hit apply uh on our ball if we didn't do that before which I don't think we did so we are speeding through these points today the next up is organization because I want this uh project to look a bit more needy uh so let's take our current score destructible down hit endpoint enemy final score and kill on hit scripts and drag them under the scripts folder let's also make a scenes folder so let's create a folder called scenes and drag in our levels and our main menu and next up we have these two materials so let's drag them under the materials folder great so now everything is just as it should be one thing I like to do is I like to have the opening scene which would be our main menu in the root assets folder this way people know what to click if they uh download the project and want to start from the very beginning next up we go under uh file build settings and make sure that all of your scenes are in the build settings that's very important cool so the final thing that we need to do is just creating an icon so uh let's do this um we could use several assets from the game in creating this icon uh for example we could use uh this guy uh but since this guy is modeled after a Mario character that might be a bit too much uh so we could use the ball here but I really like the look of our coin right now so let's actually snap take a snapshot of that so um let's just temporarily disable everything but that uh coin that is in the frame so let's disable uh the ball let's disable the platform to there we go uh now we can go in here and we can turn off the Sky Box using this button here we want the lighting to be on because I like the uh lighting effect that comes from uh the sun being high heightened a bit and uh then we can turn off all of these gizmos that are also in the way we could uh do 3D uh icons and just size them all the way down which I think is what we're going to do we can also turn off the grid and now we actually have a clean background uh to use so let's just zoom in on this might as well get get a pretty HD uh picture you can also full screen this by using shift space which I'm going to do and you will notice that it is U uh clear that this is a fairly low poly object uh but I think that will be fine for our case so now let's go under our Snipping Tool uh some kind of uh or uh Windows uses the Snipping tool for screenshots on Mac this would be command Shift 4 uh in order to take a screenshot where you can uh select part of the screen as um as the uh image you want to take whoops whoa I did something crazy there so let's Zoom back in on the coin and we need to find a good angle I think we want it kind of from the side here so something like that looks fairly decent and uh whoops Jesus Christ what why does it keep doing that so let's try and zoom in on the coin here let's do this one last time I think I I hit some kind of mouse button there okay so let's take the Snipping Tool again command Shift 4 in the Mac let's hit new and let's just drag around this fine now let's uh save this as coin you can just save it on the desktop so far and uh let's open up Photoshop and just clean up my desktop here a bit cool so uh basically all we're going to do is we're going to create uh a new image and I like to make this uh much larer larger than it needs to be let's do 1920 by 1920 or uh actually 1080 by 1080 it's going to be fine and we're going to call this the make a game logo or icon and uh let's just hit okay it's going to create this image now let's double click on the background rename this to BG and uh let's drag in our coin cool let's scale up this coin and uh let's now remove this ugly looking background so uh we can just use the magic War to do this let's just see how that looks uh first click to make a selection this then press uh control shift I to invert that selection and then uh click on the mask down here the layer mask and it will mask away all that so that actually looks fairly good and uh we could do some more stuff with this I think that we should maybe uh do some kind of uh background for this so uh let's go ahead and create a rounded rectangle Tool uh let's select a color for this and maybe some kind of Deep Blue could be fun here uh let's round the corners a bit more than uh 10 pixels let's try 40 pixels and let's try and drag this by pressing in the center then holding shift and ALT something like uh this then let's Center this both this and the coin uh by uh pressing control and then clicking on the BG here that will select our entire screen we could also just uh use the rectangular Mark tool here and just uh Mark everything off and uh then we want to select this rounded rectangle go under uh layer align layers to selection vertical centers and layer align uh layers to selection horizontal centers and uh we'll do the same thing with our coin so let's just drag this under our coin image or layer align layers to selection vertical layer align layers to selection horizontal just to make sure that it's in the center now we can uh scale this up to fit our entire screen cool and uh let's see what do we want to do with this uh you can see here that the mask hasn't been perfect so let's just make sure to delete simply select the mask over here then hit M select all of this and just delete that just to make sure that we don't have any ugly edges is once we export this uh maybe it would have been a good idea to like increase the radius on this to something uh more um but I think for now we're just going to stick with uh the 40 here I'm doing this fairly quickly just to demonstrate how uh you would go about doing this so we can play around with uh some different uh colors here I kind of like this light blue which is also kind of a a um uh theme color for the Mega game series so let's just stick with that uh and we can maybe do some kind of cool looking Edge on this so let's duplicate the rounded rectangle and just drag it in a bit and uh let's make this uh darker and still give it a bit of blue I'll show you something cool you can do with this just in a moment and then we can double click this and select inner Shadow and bump up the size on this and that really adds some depth to the picture and now we can just change the uh color of our edge here because I want it to be kind of more bright that is pretty fine I want the edge to be larger because the icon is going to be fairly small and we can also give the coin here a drop shadow so drop shadow on that size it up a bit that looks fairly nice we could also make it Glow if we wanted to but I think we are just going to uh not uh we could also add a bevel to the outside here but I think that's going to be a uh bit too much uh however it would be pretty nice to add some kind of uh gradient to that so let's go under gradient overlay and let's change this to luminosity and let's actually let's change this to Overlay instead and let's bump down the opacity quite a bit on that so something like this looks like a pretty cool icon it's very simple and easy to just take an uh element from your game which you think is pretty Central and then just kind of make a background for it and whoops you have an icon so I think we're just going to stick with this it's not perfect um but I think it will be pretty good for now so let's uh go under file save as let's locate our project folder uh actually I'm just going to save this into our um our asset pack so uh let's go under Mac assets here uh let's go under um textures I guess I really want this to be named images Maybe actually let's just save this in the root folder so make a game Icon and this is going to be the PSD version save and also we'll make a JPEG version uh for those of you who have not uh who don't have uh Photoshop installed and uh now we can simply open up Unity we can go and uh simply drag these into the RO root folder of unity uh so I'm simply going to uh you know discard my changes to the scene go on the main menu and hit don't save because we don't want to save those changes and we can go back in and enable all of the gizmos here and show the grid again and whoops we are back and uh let's just go under the Mac assets let's go and drag in I'm just going to drag in the pstd in a unity and you can see it Imports the icon nicely we then going to change this from texture to uh Sprite and uh you can basically leave all of these we want the filter mode to be bilinear you could do trilinear and we want it to be true color and a maximum of 248 just perfect hit apply on that and uh now we can go and uh simply insert this into our build uh settings so if you go on the build settings select the platform you want go under player settings uh you can see that we can change this to this company name is braies the product name is make a game and uh you can simply drag in the default icon and you can see it scale here so once you build this and um I'm just going to do a quick test build hope that this U works out or I'm going to go into depth uh way more depth with the build settings uh in some of the next videos but now let's just build this into uh the desk into um find the Dropbox here um mag make a game and let's create a separate folder here called builds and let's call this test build it's going to save that and it's going to start building okay so it's done building and uh you can see that window sometimes has this weird bug where it shows the icon at really low resolution uh but I find that sometimes if you just move it from one folder to another it refreshes and other times you have to restart and uh that's I don't know it's some weirdness uh but we're going to look into making it into an installable and all that in another video but just for now if we hold down control and zoom in on this we can see that it's actually pretty high resolution and that it looks really nicely and if we open that it's of course going to start up the game cool so that was basically all for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to finally building our game uh uh properly in the next video so thanks for watching and I hope you enjoyed it
