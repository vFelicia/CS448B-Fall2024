00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number nine on making a
00:06 - multiplayer FPS in unity in today's
00:08 - video we're going to take a look at
00:10 - adding some cool graphics to our game
00:12 - most particularly we're going to be
00:14 - adding a player model so that's going to
00:16 - be really awesome before we get started
00:18 - I just want to talk about what's going
00:20 - on with this so if you haven't seen my
00:22 - latest 2d platformer video you don't
00:24 - know that I've changed this video format
00:26 - so I hope you like it as it is now
00:29 - and also I've made a survey where people
00:33 - could answer some questions about how
00:35 - they would like the practice video
00:36 - format to be in the future future and
00:38 - I'm going to make a forum post about
00:42 - that which will be in the description
00:43 - and we can see some of the results on
00:46 - what people have voted for but
00:48 - definitely most people voted that I
00:50 - should keep the face cam so that's what
00:52 - you're going to be seeing in this video
00:54 - so I hope you can bear with me if it's
00:56 - not something of your liking but the
00:58 - people have spoken sort of see so I'll
01:01 - really try and have it so that the face
01:04 - cam is not too distracting or doesn't
01:07 - cover anything up so with that said
01:09 - let's go into today's video all right so
01:12 - you can see um I have this player model
01:15 - folder and I haven't really decided
01:16 - where I want to upload this yet but a
01:19 - link to download it will definitely be
01:21 - in the description and this is an
01:23 - awesome robot model made by semina iDEN
01:26 - and a link to him is also in the
01:28 - description he does client work and he's
01:30 - just great to work with I've done so
01:32 - multiple times and he has great prices
01:36 - and is really experienced so definitely
01:39 - check him out but anyway so we can just
01:42 - import this entire folder you can see it
01:44 - has an FBX file that's a model file and
01:48 - that can be basically opened in pretty
01:51 - much any 3d modeling application if you
01:53 - want to change something we then have
01:55 - the textures for the parts of the robot
01:58 - and for the body which is just a sphere
02:01 - here so you can see we have the
02:03 - different textures in there and the
02:04 - model file itself so what we want to do
02:07 - is simply take this player model folder
02:09 - and drag into a unity just like that and
02:12 - unity will start import
02:14 - all of the different assets this might
02:16 - take a little wild depending on your
02:18 - computer speed I'm recording here so
02:20 - okay it actually wasn't too bad and then
02:23 - it's going to give you a warning here
02:25 - that says it can calculate tangents this
02:28 - can just be ignored that's because we
02:29 - have an empty object within the model
02:32 - hierarchy which we're simply going to
02:35 - delete so it doesn't matter that that's
02:37 - giving us a warning there so you can see
02:40 - we have the player model here and I just
02:41 - want to start by dragging this into the
02:43 - scene and you can see it there and of
02:46 - course make sure the transform is reset
02:48 - and you can see it's way too large so
02:51 - let's go into the play model import
02:53 - settings and scale this down to 0.1 and
02:56 - then hit apply and also now that it has
02:59 - imported the materials we can go ahead
03:02 - and uncheck that and then we can see we
03:05 - have some tangents here we want to
03:08 - calculate those and import the normals
03:10 - so that's perfect hit apply on that we
03:12 - can go into the rig make sure it's set
03:14 - to none and animations and just disable
03:16 - that because there are no animations
03:19 - with this model we're going to create
03:20 - them on our own so you can see now we
03:23 - have the body and parts those are just
03:25 - textures and then we have the materials
03:27 - folder and it's automatically created
03:29 - two different materials for us and
03:31 - that's not quite how we want it set up
03:33 - because if we just move this guy up a
03:35 - bit and our shadow quality is currently
03:37 - awful you can change that under the
03:40 - project settings quality I'm just going
03:42 - to keep it because I'm recording whilst
03:44 - doing this so we can bump it up later so
03:48 - again we can select these different
03:50 - materials and if we just take the body
03:52 - one and color this black you can see
03:54 - that it isn't applied because we lost
03:56 - that connection when we told you not to
03:58 - import the materials so we can go ahead
04:00 - and apply this to the sphere there and
04:04 - then the insides here let's just rename
04:08 - this two parts I'm just using these
04:11 - materials you can go ahead and create
04:12 - them on its it's basically the same
04:14 - thing let's just make this red and we're
04:17 - going to add that to this and to the
04:22 - thrusters those are the pipes and then
04:25 - we can create a three
04:27 - one material and this is going to be the
04:30 - highlight and we can just make this blue
04:35 - and drag it on to there good just so we
04:40 - can know what is what here and then we
04:42 - can expand the player model hierarchy
04:44 - and delete the first object here that
04:46 - one is empty but the rest we are going
04:48 - to need so this is going to be our armor
04:51 - or parts or whatever your armor this is
04:55 - going to be our thrusters this is going
04:59 - to be our body and our eye light so all
05:06 - of these naming and how you choose to do
05:08 - materials it's completely up to you you
05:10 - can take this model and do whatever you
05:11 - want with it but sameen has provided
05:14 - some really awesome materials so let's
05:16 - set those up so let's stop by the with
05:18 - the body here change that to a complete
05:20 - white because we're going to be using a
05:22 - texture to define the old video channel
05:24 - and that's the build body color version
05:27 - here so simply click that and that looks
05:29 - alright but the magic happens when we go
05:33 - in ahead and choose a texture for the
05:36 - metallic setting also because you can
05:38 - drag this around and all that but if we
05:41 - have it defined by a texture things
05:43 - start looking really awesome so simply
05:45 - select the body metal here and you can
05:47 - see what kind of cool shiny look that
05:50 - gives us then we select a normal map
05:52 - that's the body normal and you can see
05:55 - that it's not marked as a normal map we
05:57 - can simply click fix now or you can go
06:00 - ahead and find it and choose normal and
06:02 - then we want a height map and that's
06:05 - going to be our body height and yeah
06:08 - that settings going to be just fine so
06:09 - you can see that is a very nice shiny
06:12 - material that we have there of this kind
06:15 - of well used robot I mean it's not
06:20 - exactly factory new so it's it's well
06:23 - worn good and then we can have some
06:26 - textures for the parts here so again
06:28 - let's change this to white going to the
06:31 - albedo and select parts color then undo
06:37 - metallic and select parts metal
06:40 - and under the normal map and select
06:42 - parts normal and again fixed now and you
06:45 - can see that that gives us this awesome
06:47 - looking texture it's a hand-painted cool
06:53 - so I'm actually really satisfied with
06:55 - that however I want to change the slide
06:57 - just a bit instead of changing the
06:59 - albedo I want that to be some kind of
07:01 - gray and then do an omission instead and
07:05 - we're just going to make this a light
07:08 - blue something like that and you can
07:13 - play around with these settings to make
07:15 - it look even better but I think that
07:17 - gives a really nice impression that this
07:19 - is kind of glowing from the robot we're
07:23 - also going to add some thruster
07:25 - particles at some point but I don't know
07:27 - if we'll be doing that in this tutorial
07:28 - we have a lot of stuff to cover so now
07:31 - that we have this set up and you can say
07:33 - just throw sin that morning again we can
07:36 - just clear that now that we have this
07:38 - set up we can go ahead and add this to
07:40 - our player object so let's drag our
07:43 - player into the scene let's drag our you
07:47 - can see under graphics here we have a
07:48 - player model let's just drag our new
07:50 - player model under there delete the old
07:53 - one continue we are going to lose our
07:56 - prefab connection and then reset the
07:58 - transform on this one and then we can
08:01 - simply hit apply again here to bring
08:03 - back the prefab connection here and you
08:06 - can see that the thrusters are made in
08:08 - such a way that we can actually tilt
08:11 - them in order to simulate the player
08:18 - moving because of force applied from the
08:20 - thrusters so that's kind of the
08:23 - animation that we're going to have some
08:25 - when he's idle we are going to have the
08:26 - thrusters pointing downwards when he's
08:29 - moving forward we're going to have them
08:31 - pointing backwards and when he's moving
08:33 - backwards we're going to have them
08:34 - pointing forwards so that's going to
08:38 - look really awesome but you will also
08:39 - see that he's currently rotated by 180
08:42 - degrees so we're going to flip him over
08:44 - so let's just take the entire player
08:47 - model here and we could just scale him
08:49 - on a negative one on the Z here or we
08:53 - could
08:54 - Tatom I mean this is simply a matter of
08:56 - preference I'm just going to do a 180 on
08:57 - the Y and that's going to work just fine
09:01 - I don't think it's going to have any
09:03 - influence on well anything great so that
09:08 - already looks really awesome and we
09:11 - apply these changes and delete the
09:13 - player we can already take him for spin
09:15 - and these changes will be applied to the
09:18 - actual game or to the network so he will
09:23 - spawn with a cool player model you can
09:26 - see some issues appear however you can
09:28 - see that when we spawn we are actually
09:32 - able to see our own player model and
09:34 - that might be fine for some things but
09:38 - if we have this huge huge piece of armor
09:42 - blocking our screen that's not really
09:46 - something that we want to see so we are
09:48 - definitely going to have to set up some
09:50 - kind of system for disabling that I mean
09:53 - if we go under our player here drag it
09:56 - in here and go under the components to
09:59 - disable but there's nothing nothing
10:02 - really telling this that the Koenen
10:04 - components that we want to disable
10:06 - should be on this object it could be
10:10 - components on other objects and
10:12 - therefore we might just go around and
10:13 - disable renderers on other objects so we
10:16 - can simply add some to this and that's
10:19 - maybe something that we want to do for
10:20 - now so let's just change that so we have
10:23 - room for one more and then find let's
10:27 - lock this and then add a tab inspector
10:31 - add another inspector have this over
10:34 - here that one is locked this one is not
10:36 - then we find our armor and take the mesh
10:41 - renderer on that and drag it know that
10:45 - can actually not be disabled here so it
10:48 - seems that the mesh renderer is not
10:51 - actually a behavior okay it's definitely
10:57 - a component but it's not a behavior so
11:01 - that's fine and that that's definite is
11:04 - something that we can take care of I
11:05 - mean we can add another list
11:07 - here we can add a custom mesh renderer
11:09 - we could have a list that disabled
11:12 - objects or we could add a mask to the
11:15 - camera we have so many options for
11:18 - getting this to work however what I want
11:20 - to do now is simply ignore it so let's
11:23 - just see when we'll have time for that
11:25 - it's an easy fix when we get to it but
11:27 - right now I have some other stuff that I
11:29 - want to focus on so let's just close
11:32 - that tab there and we'll come back to it
11:34 - a bit later so what I wanted to have a
11:38 - look at now is synchronizing is is
11:41 - animating these thrusters and then
11:44 - syncing that over the network and unity
11:47 - has some awesome ways I'm syncing
11:49 - animations and they have what is called
11:52 - a network if we go and here a network
11:54 - animator which requires a normal
11:57 - animator as in a variable slot and then
12:01 - you are able to choose what properties
12:03 - you want to sing over the network
12:05 - however that doesn't smooth anything out
12:08 - so if you want smooth rotation which is
12:12 - something that we want smooth blending
12:15 - that doesn't really work so what we're
12:18 - going to do is we're going to rotate
12:19 - these locally and then add a network
12:22 - transform child to sync their rotation
12:24 - over the network because that will
12:26 - actually apply smoothing so it's maybe
12:28 - not the best way but it's definitely
12:30 - going to work just fine so let's do that
12:33 - let's start by adding some animation so
12:36 - let's find our animation window it's
12:38 - under window animation or press control
12:41 - 6 and in here if we select our player
12:45 - we're able to create a new animator and
12:47 - animation clip let's set create go onto
12:50 - our player model make a new folder
12:52 - called animation go under that folder
12:57 - and in here we are going to let's make
13:01 - the idle animation first and we can
13:05 - simply make sure that this is red and
13:07 - those are red and then we can go on to
13:09 - graphics player model thrusters simply
13:12 - select those again make sure to click
13:15 - this
13:17 - and now we are recording so that means
13:19 - that we can actually change our rotation
13:22 - here so these are actually a bit offset
13:24 - I don't know if you want to start with
13:26 - those offsets let's just disable the
13:28 - animation there and try and reset this
13:32 - no because we want them to be scaled
13:34 - let's just zero that out zero that and
13:39 - that out no it doesn't look good okay
13:44 - so we'll just keep all of these settings
13:45 - and then only change this that's fine so
13:48 - let's hit record again and when we're
13:51 - not moving well we want to change those
13:53 - so they are pointing downwards and the
13:56 - anchor here is not perfect so let's just
13:58 - do about negative 40 that should make
14:01 - them point downwards yeah just by
14:04 - measurement of the eye and just to make
14:08 - sure that this is working let's copy
14:09 - these keyframes move over with one
14:11 - second and paste them again so we're
14:13 - just going to have this animation state
14:15 - here it's not going to do any animation
14:17 - on the timeline we instead going to be
14:19 - blending using the speed of our object
14:22 - but you'll see that in a sec so let's
14:25 - now create a new clip let's call this
14:28 - one move forward and again select the
14:35 - thrusters make sure we're recording find
14:39 - the rotation parameter and I believe
14:42 - we're simply going to set this to
14:44 - negative 90 that looks right and let's
14:50 - copy those over to one second great
14:54 - let's create the last clip here and this
14:56 - is going to be move backward and again
15:04 - select the thruster record and let's
15:06 - simply select zero here copy that for
15:10 - one second stop recording and that was
15:13 - it that was all we needed to do to make
15:15 - our animations and we can just close
15:17 - those off now let's go into the project
15:20 - go and do the pom pom pom pom pom player
15:24 - model animation and find our animation
15:29 - controller here called player
15:31 - just going to call this player
15:33 - controller or play your animation player
15:37 - and them controller there we go let's
15:40 - stop a click that to open it up in the
15:42 - animator and let's just make some room
15:44 - for the animator here and you can see
15:47 - that we have three animation states we
15:49 - have an idle and move forward and a move
15:51 - backward and they each have their
15:53 - associated animation so idle move
15:57 - forward and move backward but we should
16:01 - just go ahead and delete these because
16:03 - we don't want to transition between them
16:05 - by using some kind of boolean state or
16:08 - whether or not we are passing some kind
16:13 - of requirement and then we transition no
16:16 - we want to transition fluently so we
16:17 - want making them the unity animation
16:20 - system to blend between them and
16:22 - therefore we can create what is called a
16:25 - plain tree so right click create state
16:27 - from new plan tree and we can go ahead
16:31 - and rename this to move because it's
16:33 - basically all of our movement in one
16:36 - state and if we then double click on
16:40 - this we open up the move blend tree and
16:43 - you can see this have has a blend
16:45 - parameter and currently that goes
16:47 - between 0 & & 1 and that is kind of that
16:52 - that is the value that will blend
16:54 - between the animations so that's going
16:56 - to be represent our forward speed so we
17:00 - can go ahead and rename this to forward
17:03 - and I was going to say speed here but
17:06 - senses can both be a negative and
17:08 - positive for forward and backwards
17:10 - movement I'm going to say forward
17:12 - velocity and but currently this goes
17:16 - from 0 to 1 and I'm going to show you
17:18 - how to change that so over here in the
17:19 - right hand side we want to add our three
17:22 - motions or 3 animation Clips so let's
17:24 - create add motion field add motion field
17:27 - add motion field in the middle we're
17:30 - going to put our idle at the beginning
17:33 - we are going to put our forward and down
17:37 - here we're going to put our backward
17:39 - then we uncheck automate thresholds and
17:43 - then we say okay
17:44 - when we're moving forward we want to
17:46 - this to be a one when we are standing
17:49 - still we want our speed to be zero and
17:51 - when we are moving backwards we want our
17:54 - speed to be negative one so we have this
17:57 - value clamp between negative one and one
17:59 - and the animation will be will blend
18:03 - using this value so if we now select our
18:07 - player and select our blend tree we can
18:10 - actually preview this down here it's
18:13 - currently set to zero if I okay so this
18:15 - is a place where my FaceCam is probably
18:18 - blocking everything let me just move
18:20 - this up a bit here I promised I wouldn't
18:24 - let it block anything so here you can
18:27 - see it just add a a forward velocity of
18:34 - zero if we then move this up you can see
18:37 - that the thruster is go backwards and if
18:40 - we move it down we can see that they
18:43 - turn forward here so that's perfect so
18:46 - we can easily blend between this in a
18:49 - very nice and fluent way so I'm going to
18:53 - move this back down because we're not
18:55 - going to be needing it anymore there we
18:57 - go and we can basically start applying
19:02 - the forward velocity using a script so
19:04 - we can just drag this back here there we
19:07 - go then we can select our player make
19:10 - sure that we have our player and
19:12 - controller here and that everything is
19:13 - looking great which it is then we can go
19:16 - in and find a script where we can change
19:19 - this so I suggest we do that inside of
19:21 - the player controller because this is
19:23 - what where we calculate our velocity
19:25 - where our speed variable is which we are
19:28 - going to be needing in order to make
19:29 - sure let's clamp between minus 1 and 1
19:32 - and all that stuff so in here let's add
19:36 - a new serialized field private animator
19:42 - which we are just going to call animator
19:46 - and then in this start method here
19:49 - actually let's not make this a serialize
19:52 - field let's require this so let's we
19:56 - require
19:59 - component of type animator let's move
20:06 - this down here where we cash out
20:10 - components so this is component caching
20:17 - and then here we simply add it so
20:21 - animator equals get component and mater
20:25 - there we go
20:27 - now we're sure it's there because again
20:29 - animator nut animation because we
20:32 - required a up there so for some reason
20:36 - the recording cut out here and it's
20:37 - lacking some audio but I'll just quickly
20:39 - tell you what we did first off we
20:42 - removed the dot normalised but we kept
20:45 - the parentheses you see me adding them
20:46 - back in there then we change the two
20:48 - input lines from get access raw to
20:50 - simply get access that makes the input
20:53 - much more smooth we could smooth that
20:55 - ourselves but unity does it it does a
20:57 - great job actually next up you can see
21:01 - me making a comment here because we are
21:03 - now animating our movement we do this by
21:05 - calling set float on our animator the
21:07 - float we want to change is forward
21:09 - velocity and we want to set it to this
21:11 - set movement and just clear out some
21:16 - warnings here those are just from the
21:18 - new update and they're definitely not
21:20 - important so we won't be looking at
21:22 - those right now and this should now be
21:27 - working locally so let's try and remove
21:30 - that after having applied the changes
21:33 - play the game going to land host and we
21:35 - can maybe zoom out here so we can see
21:37 - what's going on land host yeah it's
21:40 - working so you can see how this is
21:42 - smooth the movement is now much smoother
21:45 - and I think it's a nice amount of smooth
21:48 - it's not overdone and you can see how
21:51 - the thruster is down here change as we
21:55 - move cool
21:59 - so that actually looks very nice and I
22:01 - think it helps give the impression that
22:03 - this robot is actually moving for reason
22:07 - not just adding forces out of thin air
22:11 - next up is sinking this over the network
22:14 - and that might sound really difficult
22:16 - and I definitely had some trouble
22:17 - figuring out the best way to do this but
22:20 - once you know how it's really easy so
22:22 - let's just search for chat transform and
22:24 - then add the network transform child
22:26 - component we've already added one of
22:29 - those up here and we're going to add one
22:31 - with basically the same settings except
22:33 - this time if we drag the player into the
22:36 - hierarchy we're going to go into the
22:37 - graphics player model and instead of
22:40 - having the are having the camera
22:43 - transform we're going to have our
22:45 - thrusters as the target and the movement
22:49 - threshold is going to be the same here
22:51 - again in turbulent movement it's going
22:53 - to be zero this is final point three and
22:56 - we only want to sink our X so it's all
22:59 - of the same values as up here but
23:01 - remember to change the target then we're
23:03 - going to apply this and we can again
23:08 - remove this from the scene and I think
23:11 - we are ready to build this actually so
23:12 - whoops some kind of null reference
23:16 - that's caused by unity I think I don't
23:19 - think we need to worry about that so
23:21 - let's just make sure yeah we have a
23:24 - target here and our animated looks fine
23:26 - I can't see any issues with this so
23:28 - let's try and build this control V or
23:30 - command B and see if it's working so
23:39 - this is taking an odd amount of time
23:41 - here okay great
23:44 - and hit plane here actually I'm just
23:48 - going to wait for it to calculate the
23:50 - lighting here there we go and you can
23:54 - see here that this is waiting so let's
23:56 - make this the host and make this decline
23:59 - and watch this guy now as we start to
24:02 - move no okay so this is not working and
24:08 - I know why do you know why think about
24:11 - this okay so if we take a look at our
24:15 - player here actually I should have
24:17 - waited and taking a look at the other
24:19 - guy so in here we have an animator we
24:22 - have a player mode and a player
24:24 - controller
24:25 - the animator uses the animation
24:29 - controller to every frame check for
24:32 - different values and then transition the
24:34 - animation depending on those values and
24:36 - those values are the properties or the
24:39 - parameters up here and this starts it's
24:43 - a value of 0 so we have a starting
24:45 - forward velocity of 0 unless it's
24:48 - changed by the player motor or the
24:51 - player controller however under our
24:55 - player setup we have this array of
24:57 - components to disable we disable the
24:59 - player motor and all of a bunch of stuff
25:01 - we also disabled the player controller
25:04 - so that's me that means that for all
25:06 - clients which are not the local client
25:09 - the arm or for all players which is not
25:13 - the local player the player controller
25:18 - is going to be disabled and therefore
25:19 - the animator is never going to
25:22 - experience a property of forward
25:25 - velocity other than zero so it's always
25:27 - going to have a forward velocity of zero
25:29 - there's nothing there to change it and
25:30 - that will overwrite whatever information
25:33 - we sync using our network transform
25:36 - child so if we stop this now and find
25:39 - our player we can actually simply expand
25:43 - our player setup go into components to
25:46 - disable add room from one more and drag
25:50 - in our animator and I think that will do
25:54 - it so I think that will basically be it
25:56 - so now we can build this one more time
25:58 - oops hit the wrong key there let's build
26:01 - this one more time and hopefully this
26:05 - time it's going to work
26:08 - let's have that there and this is why
26:10 - net debugging over the network is so
26:13 - difficult because you can have stuff
26:15 - overriding each other without giving any
26:17 - errors and it's K can be such a pain to
26:21 - debug so again let's observe here let's
26:27 - drag this over here client again look
26:30 - over here yes so now it's working that
26:34 - was indeed the error and it actually
26:36 - looks very very smooth
26:38 - with these physics here we have going on
26:41 - it really looks like he's floating on
26:43 - some thrusters so I think that's just
26:45 - perfect and you will notice that if we
26:48 - give it a bit too much force here and
26:50 - drop down you can see the thruster
26:52 - simply clip through the ground but I
26:54 - don't think that's an issue right now I
26:55 - think we have other stuff to look at so
26:58 - that looks really really cool
27:01 - what the heck let let's add some
27:04 - particles so now if we drag our player
27:07 - in here we can we can add some player
27:13 - thruster particles down here so in order
27:16 - to do this let's right-click go import
27:22 - package particle systems because if I
27:25 - remember correctly unity has some really
27:28 - cool default thruster particles we're
27:30 - not going to be spending too much time
27:32 - on this that would be kind of silly but
27:34 - I definitely think that we should add
27:35 - some of them did I not hit particles
27:38 - here we have all kinds of control stuff
27:42 - don't want any of that
27:44 - none okay so that's like none here and
27:46 - just find the ones that we want so the
27:48 - standard assets no input all of the
27:51 - particle systems of the prefabs don't
27:58 - think we're going to be needing any of
28:00 - the scripts let's just keep them shaders
28:04 - textures none of the utility none of
28:08 - this other stuff okay so that's all
28:10 - we're going to be using here so let's
28:12 - import that this might take a little
28:16 - while okay that was actually quite
28:17 - speedy again let's go into the console
28:21 - just clear those warnings and now we can
28:24 - go into standard assets particle systems
28:26 - now you can see we have some different
28:28 - stuff in here let's find a cool prefab
28:30 - so let's find the afterburner one this
28:33 - was exactly the one that I wanted to
28:35 - find so you can see this is a quite a
28:38 - huge particle system but I think it
28:42 - looks really really cool and it gives
28:44 - this subtle but awesome looking effect
28:47 - of an afterburner
28:49 - so let's definitely keep this but just
28:51 - change it a bit
28:52 - so we definitely want this to be smaller
28:56 - in any kind of way possible so we have
28:59 - this glow here it's that just that's
29:01 - another particle system and the
29:05 - afterburn itself so the glow okay it's
29:09 - just a centered glowy effect there let's
29:12 - just take this one at a time so let's
29:13 - start by looking at the afterburner and
29:20 - this is currently really long so let's
29:23 - start by changing the last lifetime on
29:25 - this to something like 0.1 and maybe
29:29 - bump down the start speed a bit too so
29:31 - let's set this to 20 think that looks a
29:37 - lot better and definitely we want the
29:40 - size of these to be much smaller too so
29:43 - let's try 0.2 and to 0.4 that is better
29:52 - but we definitely want the speed to be
29:55 - lower 10 looks pretty decent but we
30:01 - might want to spawn more or set this
30:05 - lifetime a bit longer because currently
30:08 - we can see between these so the rate
30:10 - here is 80 and that's already a pretty
30:13 - high spawn rate but we can set it to 120
30:16 - that's not going to matter and this is
30:20 - starting to look like something that we
30:22 - can add to the first edge here so let's
30:26 - just take this now going to player
30:28 - graphics player model thrusters and
30:30 - let's add the afterburners here so let's
30:32 - go on to thruster let's reset the
30:34 - transform on this let's drag this out
30:39 - down here try and position these as
30:43 - accurately as possible yeah that's not
30:48 - far off so let's drag it down a bit
30:50 - something like that and we also need to
30:54 - rotate this to point the right way
31:02 - almost correct oops
31:08 - something like that looks like a great
31:11 - starting point awesome
31:14 - it's not totally even we can do better
31:21 - that looks pretty great awesome so you
31:26 - can see here it's still a pretty long
31:28 - effect so I think we can actually just
31:31 - make the speed lower again so let's
31:33 - change this to 5 yeah that looks much
31:36 - better and we can even move it a bit up
31:38 - in the tube that's fine and then we need
31:41 - to rotate it a bit in widths actually we
31:46 - can do a bit more something like that
31:51 - that's might maybe a - a bit too much
31:55 - yeah that looks really great and move it
31:58 - over a bit awesome and you can fill it
32:01 - around with this as much as you want I'm
32:04 - just going to keep it like this for now
32:06 - and then we can add the globe back in
32:08 - and this is going to be probably a too
32:10 - big a bit too big now you can see just
32:15 - how large that is it goes all the way
32:18 - through the ground so let's just change
32:21 - the speed of this on to four and it's
32:26 - going to limit it whoops I don't know
32:31 - why it zoomed out so far there we go see
32:36 - just how launched these particles are so
32:38 - the stat size here is going to be
32:40 - something like 0.5 to 0.6 looks better
32:48 - and the lifetime 0.3 smaller point one
32:55 - point two two point four three two
33:01 - that's pretty I actually really like the
33:05 - look of that for some reason it goes out
33:09 - really far when I try to focus on it so
33:11 - let's try and simulate that that looks
33:13 - awesome okay so I'm really happy with
33:16 - that effect
33:18 - I think we can just go ahead and add
33:19 - this to the other side as well so this
33:22 - this is going to be afterburner one we
33:26 - can duplicate this and do afterburner
33:28 - two actually let's make this left and
33:31 - right so this is going to be afterburner
33:37 - underscore it left and this is going to
33:43 - be afterburner underscore right and
33:47 - we're going to look from the direction
33:48 - of the player here so we are going to
33:50 - inverse the x-axis like that and then we
34:02 - are going to be can maybe just scale it
34:04 - on the X as well that's doing negative
34:07 - here no that doesn't work so we have to
34:10 - inverse on the rotation here as well so
34:13 - let's the up-and-down that's going to be
34:16 - fine
34:16 - so the Y here should be shifted a bit
34:24 - and I think that looks pretty great yeah
34:34 - so let's go ahead and see how that looks
34:36 - in the game so close that close that
34:39 - then and that let's hit apply
34:42 - remove the player save and let's hit
34:47 - play LAN host whoops okay so we are
34:53 - definitely flying something is happening
34:55 - here maybe I forgot to remove some
34:57 - script or some swords on these so the
35:00 - thrusters are here you have to burn it
35:03 - yeah there we go
35:05 - they have a physics force and a Collider
35:07 - we want none of that so let's delete
35:10 - them both the physics force and the
35:15 - collider they were adding some kind of
35:16 - force we don't want that to happen so
35:21 - that's it applied to that again say that
35:24 - going and hit play land host it says the
35:29 - reference script on this game
35:31 - behavior is missing so again there is
35:36 - something so let's just move out here
35:38 - find our player graphics play model
35:41 - thrusters it's like both glow objects
35:45 - and let's remove that not that it
35:47 - matters but it's nice to just remove a
35:50 - unnecessary warning that also always
35:53 - feels good so let's apply that delete
35:56 - the player let's try this one last time
35:58 - so let's say play LAN host and now you
36:03 - can see the thrusters are looking great
36:05 - so we can of course get those to vary
36:08 - depending on what we are doing for now I
36:10 - just want them to be a constant thing
36:13 - give the impression that something is
36:16 - holding us up we can definitely also do
36:18 - some hover bouncing or something but
36:22 - we'll see with all of that so that was
36:24 - basically all I could come up with for
36:27 - this tutorial
36:28 - next time will probably take care of the
36:30 - stuff that is currently blocking our
36:32 - screen maybe do something about the
36:34 - environment - I don't know so we'll have
36:36 - a see in the next video but thanks for
36:38 - watching I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
36:40 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to video number nine on making a multiplayer FPS in unity in today's video we're going to take a look at adding some cool graphics to our game most particularly we're going to be adding a player model so that's going to be really awesome before we get started I just want to talk about what's going on with this so if you haven't seen my latest 2d platformer video you don't know that I've changed this video format so I hope you like it as it is now and also I've made a survey where people could answer some questions about how they would like the practice video format to be in the future future and I'm going to make a forum post about that which will be in the description and we can see some of the results on what people have voted for but definitely most people voted that I should keep the face cam so that's what you're going to be seeing in this video so I hope you can bear with me if it's not something of your liking but the people have spoken sort of see so I'll really try and have it so that the face cam is not too distracting or doesn't cover anything up so with that said let's go into today's video all right so you can see um I have this player model folder and I haven't really decided where I want to upload this yet but a link to download it will definitely be in the description and this is an awesome robot model made by semina iDEN and a link to him is also in the description he does client work and he's just great to work with I've done so multiple times and he has great prices and is really experienced so definitely check him out but anyway so we can just import this entire folder you can see it has an FBX file that's a model file and that can be basically opened in pretty much any 3d modeling application if you want to change something we then have the textures for the parts of the robot and for the body which is just a sphere here so you can see we have the different textures in there and the model file itself so what we want to do is simply take this player model folder and drag into a unity just like that and unity will start import all of the different assets this might take a little wild depending on your computer speed I'm recording here so okay it actually wasn't too bad and then it's going to give you a warning here that says it can calculate tangents this can just be ignored that's because we have an empty object within the model hierarchy which we're simply going to delete so it doesn't matter that that's giving us a warning there so you can see we have the player model here and I just want to start by dragging this into the scene and you can see it there and of course make sure the transform is reset and you can see it's way too large so let's go into the play model import settings and scale this down to 0.1 and then hit apply and also now that it has imported the materials we can go ahead and uncheck that and then we can see we have some tangents here we want to calculate those and import the normals so that's perfect hit apply on that we can go into the rig make sure it's set to none and animations and just disable that because there are no animations with this model we're going to create them on our own so you can see now we have the body and parts those are just textures and then we have the materials folder and it's automatically created two different materials for us and that's not quite how we want it set up because if we just move this guy up a bit and our shadow quality is currently awful you can change that under the project settings quality I'm just going to keep it because I'm recording whilst doing this so we can bump it up later so again we can select these different materials and if we just take the body one and color this black you can see that it isn't applied because we lost that connection when we told you not to import the materials so we can go ahead and apply this to the sphere there and then the insides here let's just rename this two parts I'm just using these materials you can go ahead and create them on its it's basically the same thing let's just make this red and we're going to add that to this and to the thrusters those are the pipes and then we can create a three one material and this is going to be the highlight and we can just make this blue and drag it on to there good just so we can know what is what here and then we can expand the player model hierarchy and delete the first object here that one is empty but the rest we are going to need so this is going to be our armor or parts or whatever your armor this is going to be our thrusters this is going to be our body and our eye light so all of these naming and how you choose to do materials it's completely up to you you can take this model and do whatever you want with it but sameen has provided some really awesome materials so let's set those up so let's stop by the with the body here change that to a complete white because we're going to be using a texture to define the old video channel and that's the build body color version here so simply click that and that looks alright but the magic happens when we go in ahead and choose a texture for the metallic setting also because you can drag this around and all that but if we have it defined by a texture things start looking really awesome so simply select the body metal here and you can see what kind of cool shiny look that gives us then we select a normal map that's the body normal and you can see that it's not marked as a normal map we can simply click fix now or you can go ahead and find it and choose normal and then we want a height map and that's going to be our body height and yeah that settings going to be just fine so you can see that is a very nice shiny material that we have there of this kind of well used robot I mean it's not exactly factory new so it's it's well worn good and then we can have some textures for the parts here so again let's change this to white going to the albedo and select parts color then undo metallic and select parts metal and under the normal map and select parts normal and again fixed now and you can see that that gives us this awesome looking texture it's a handpainted cool so I'm actually really satisfied with that however I want to change the slide just a bit instead of changing the albedo I want that to be some kind of gray and then do an omission instead and we're just going to make this a light blue something like that and you can play around with these settings to make it look even better but I think that gives a really nice impression that this is kind of glowing from the robot we're also going to add some thruster particles at some point but I don't know if we'll be doing that in this tutorial we have a lot of stuff to cover so now that we have this set up and you can say just throw sin that morning again we can just clear that now that we have this set up we can go ahead and add this to our player object so let's drag our player into the scene let's drag our you can see under graphics here we have a player model let's just drag our new player model under there delete the old one continue we are going to lose our prefab connection and then reset the transform on this one and then we can simply hit apply again here to bring back the prefab connection here and you can see that the thrusters are made in such a way that we can actually tilt them in order to simulate the player moving because of force applied from the thrusters so that's kind of the animation that we're going to have some when he's idle we are going to have the thrusters pointing downwards when he's moving forward we're going to have them pointing backwards and when he's moving backwards we're going to have them pointing forwards so that's going to look really awesome but you will also see that he's currently rotated by 180 degrees so we're going to flip him over so let's just take the entire player model here and we could just scale him on a negative one on the Z here or we could Tatom I mean this is simply a matter of preference I'm just going to do a 180 on the Y and that's going to work just fine I don't think it's going to have any influence on well anything great so that already looks really awesome and we apply these changes and delete the player we can already take him for spin and these changes will be applied to the actual game or to the network so he will spawn with a cool player model you can see some issues appear however you can see that when we spawn we are actually able to see our own player model and that might be fine for some things but if we have this huge huge piece of armor blocking our screen that's not really something that we want to see so we are definitely going to have to set up some kind of system for disabling that I mean if we go under our player here drag it in here and go under the components to disable but there's nothing nothing really telling this that the Koenen components that we want to disable should be on this object it could be components on other objects and therefore we might just go around and disable renderers on other objects so we can simply add some to this and that's maybe something that we want to do for now so let's just change that so we have room for one more and then find let's lock this and then add a tab inspector add another inspector have this over here that one is locked this one is not then we find our armor and take the mesh renderer on that and drag it know that can actually not be disabled here so it seems that the mesh renderer is not actually a behavior okay it's definitely a component but it's not a behavior so that's fine and that that's definite is something that we can take care of I mean we can add another list here we can add a custom mesh renderer we could have a list that disabled objects or we could add a mask to the camera we have so many options for getting this to work however what I want to do now is simply ignore it so let's just see when we'll have time for that it's an easy fix when we get to it but right now I have some other stuff that I want to focus on so let's just close that tab there and we'll come back to it a bit later so what I wanted to have a look at now is synchronizing is is animating these thrusters and then syncing that over the network and unity has some awesome ways I'm syncing animations and they have what is called a network if we go and here a network animator which requires a normal animator as in a variable slot and then you are able to choose what properties you want to sing over the network however that doesn't smooth anything out so if you want smooth rotation which is something that we want smooth blending that doesn't really work so what we're going to do is we're going to rotate these locally and then add a network transform child to sync their rotation over the network because that will actually apply smoothing so it's maybe not the best way but it's definitely going to work just fine so let's do that let's start by adding some animation so let's find our animation window it's under window animation or press control 6 and in here if we select our player we're able to create a new animator and animation clip let's set create go onto our player model make a new folder called animation go under that folder and in here we are going to let's make the idle animation first and we can simply make sure that this is red and those are red and then we can go on to graphics player model thrusters simply select those again make sure to click this and now we are recording so that means that we can actually change our rotation here so these are actually a bit offset I don't know if you want to start with those offsets let's just disable the animation there and try and reset this no because we want them to be scaled let's just zero that out zero that and that out no it doesn't look good okay so we'll just keep all of these settings and then only change this that's fine so let's hit record again and when we're not moving well we want to change those so they are pointing downwards and the anchor here is not perfect so let's just do about negative 40 that should make them point downwards yeah just by measurement of the eye and just to make sure that this is working let's copy these keyframes move over with one second and paste them again so we're just going to have this animation state here it's not going to do any animation on the timeline we instead going to be blending using the speed of our object but you'll see that in a sec so let's now create a new clip let's call this one move forward and again select the thrusters make sure we're recording find the rotation parameter and I believe we're simply going to set this to negative 90 that looks right and let's copy those over to one second great let's create the last clip here and this is going to be move backward and again select the thruster record and let's simply select zero here copy that for one second stop recording and that was it that was all we needed to do to make our animations and we can just close those off now let's go into the project go and do the pom pom pom pom pom player model animation and find our animation controller here called player just going to call this player controller or play your animation player and them controller there we go let's stop a click that to open it up in the animator and let's just make some room for the animator here and you can see that we have three animation states we have an idle and move forward and a move backward and they each have their associated animation so idle move forward and move backward but we should just go ahead and delete these because we don't want to transition between them by using some kind of boolean state or whether or not we are passing some kind of requirement and then we transition no we want to transition fluently so we want making them the unity animation system to blend between them and therefore we can create what is called a plain tree so right click create state from new plan tree and we can go ahead and rename this to move because it's basically all of our movement in one state and if we then double click on this we open up the move blend tree and you can see this have has a blend parameter and currently that goes between 0 & & 1 and that is kind of that that is the value that will blend between the animations so that's going to be represent our forward speed so we can go ahead and rename this to forward and I was going to say speed here but senses can both be a negative and positive for forward and backwards movement I'm going to say forward velocity and but currently this goes from 0 to 1 and I'm going to show you how to change that so over here in the right hand side we want to add our three motions or 3 animation Clips so let's create add motion field add motion field add motion field in the middle we're going to put our idle at the beginning we are going to put our forward and down here we're going to put our backward then we uncheck automate thresholds and then we say okay when we're moving forward we want to this to be a one when we are standing still we want our speed to be zero and when we are moving backwards we want our speed to be negative one so we have this value clamp between negative one and one and the animation will be will blend using this value so if we now select our player and select our blend tree we can actually preview this down here it's currently set to zero if I okay so this is a place where my FaceCam is probably blocking everything let me just move this up a bit here I promised I wouldn't let it block anything so here you can see it just add a a forward velocity of zero if we then move this up you can see that the thruster is go backwards and if we move it down we can see that they turn forward here so that's perfect so we can easily blend between this in a very nice and fluent way so I'm going to move this back down because we're not going to be needing it anymore there we go and we can basically start applying the forward velocity using a script so we can just drag this back here there we go then we can select our player make sure that we have our player and controller here and that everything is looking great which it is then we can go in and find a script where we can change this so I suggest we do that inside of the player controller because this is what where we calculate our velocity where our speed variable is which we are going to be needing in order to make sure let's clamp between minus 1 and 1 and all that stuff so in here let's add a new serialized field private animator which we are just going to call animator and then in this start method here actually let's not make this a serialize field let's require this so let's we require component of type animator let's move this down here where we cash out components so this is component caching and then here we simply add it so animator equals get component and mater there we go now we're sure it's there because again animator nut animation because we required a up there so for some reason the recording cut out here and it's lacking some audio but I'll just quickly tell you what we did first off we removed the dot normalised but we kept the parentheses you see me adding them back in there then we change the two input lines from get access raw to simply get access that makes the input much more smooth we could smooth that ourselves but unity does it it does a great job actually next up you can see me making a comment here because we are now animating our movement we do this by calling set float on our animator the float we want to change is forward velocity and we want to set it to this set movement and just clear out some warnings here those are just from the new update and they're definitely not important so we won't be looking at those right now and this should now be working locally so let's try and remove that after having applied the changes play the game going to land host and we can maybe zoom out here so we can see what's going on land host yeah it's working so you can see how this is smooth the movement is now much smoother and I think it's a nice amount of smooth it's not overdone and you can see how the thruster is down here change as we move cool so that actually looks very nice and I think it helps give the impression that this robot is actually moving for reason not just adding forces out of thin air next up is sinking this over the network and that might sound really difficult and I definitely had some trouble figuring out the best way to do this but once you know how it's really easy so let's just search for chat transform and then add the network transform child component we've already added one of those up here and we're going to add one with basically the same settings except this time if we drag the player into the hierarchy we're going to go into the graphics player model and instead of having the are having the camera transform we're going to have our thrusters as the target and the movement threshold is going to be the same here again in turbulent movement it's going to be zero this is final point three and we only want to sink our X so it's all of the same values as up here but remember to change the target then we're going to apply this and we can again remove this from the scene and I think we are ready to build this actually so whoops some kind of null reference that's caused by unity I think I don't think we need to worry about that so let's just make sure yeah we have a target here and our animated looks fine I can't see any issues with this so let's try and build this control V or command B and see if it's working so this is taking an odd amount of time here okay great and hit plane here actually I'm just going to wait for it to calculate the lighting here there we go and you can see here that this is waiting so let's make this the host and make this decline and watch this guy now as we start to move no okay so this is not working and I know why do you know why think about this okay so if we take a look at our player here actually I should have waited and taking a look at the other guy so in here we have an animator we have a player mode and a player controller the animator uses the animation controller to every frame check for different values and then transition the animation depending on those values and those values are the properties or the parameters up here and this starts it's a value of 0 so we have a starting forward velocity of 0 unless it's changed by the player motor or the player controller however under our player setup we have this array of components to disable we disable the player motor and all of a bunch of stuff we also disabled the player controller so that's me that means that for all clients which are not the local client the arm or for all players which is not the local player the player controller is going to be disabled and therefore the animator is never going to experience a property of forward velocity other than zero so it's always going to have a forward velocity of zero there's nothing there to change it and that will overwrite whatever information we sync using our network transform child so if we stop this now and find our player we can actually simply expand our player setup go into components to disable add room from one more and drag in our animator and I think that will do it so I think that will basically be it so now we can build this one more time oops hit the wrong key there let's build this one more time and hopefully this time it's going to work let's have that there and this is why net debugging over the network is so difficult because you can have stuff overriding each other without giving any errors and it's K can be such a pain to debug so again let's observe here let's drag this over here client again look over here yes so now it's working that was indeed the error and it actually looks very very smooth with these physics here we have going on it really looks like he's floating on some thrusters so I think that's just perfect and you will notice that if we give it a bit too much force here and drop down you can see the thruster simply clip through the ground but I don't think that's an issue right now I think we have other stuff to look at so that looks really really cool what the heck let let's add some particles so now if we drag our player in here we can we can add some player thruster particles down here so in order to do this let's rightclick go import package particle systems because if I remember correctly unity has some really cool default thruster particles we're not going to be spending too much time on this that would be kind of silly but I definitely think that we should add some of them did I not hit particles here we have all kinds of control stuff don't want any of that none okay so that's like none here and just find the ones that we want so the standard assets no input all of the particle systems of the prefabs don't think we're going to be needing any of the scripts let's just keep them shaders textures none of the utility none of this other stuff okay so that's all we're going to be using here so let's import that this might take a little while okay that was actually quite speedy again let's go into the console just clear those warnings and now we can go into standard assets particle systems now you can see we have some different stuff in here let's find a cool prefab so let's find the afterburner one this was exactly the one that I wanted to find so you can see this is a quite a huge particle system but I think it looks really really cool and it gives this subtle but awesome looking effect of an afterburner so let's definitely keep this but just change it a bit so we definitely want this to be smaller in any kind of way possible so we have this glow here it's that just that's another particle system and the afterburn itself so the glow okay it's just a centered glowy effect there let's just take this one at a time so let's start by looking at the afterburner and this is currently really long so let's start by changing the last lifetime on this to something like 0.1 and maybe bump down the start speed a bit too so let's set this to 20 think that looks a lot better and definitely we want the size of these to be much smaller too so let's try 0.2 and to 0.4 that is better but we definitely want the speed to be lower 10 looks pretty decent but we might want to spawn more or set this lifetime a bit longer because currently we can see between these so the rate here is 80 and that's already a pretty high spawn rate but we can set it to 120 that's not going to matter and this is starting to look like something that we can add to the first edge here so let's just take this now going to player graphics player model thrusters and let's add the afterburners here so let's go on to thruster let's reset the transform on this let's drag this out down here try and position these as accurately as possible yeah that's not far off so let's drag it down a bit something like that and we also need to rotate this to point the right way almost correct oops something like that looks like a great starting point awesome it's not totally even we can do better that looks pretty great awesome so you can see here it's still a pretty long effect so I think we can actually just make the speed lower again so let's change this to 5 yeah that looks much better and we can even move it a bit up in the tube that's fine and then we need to rotate it a bit in widths actually we can do a bit more something like that that's might maybe a a bit too much yeah that looks really great and move it over a bit awesome and you can fill it around with this as much as you want I'm just going to keep it like this for now and then we can add the globe back in and this is going to be probably a too big a bit too big now you can see just how large that is it goes all the way through the ground so let's just change the speed of this on to four and it's going to limit it whoops I don't know why it zoomed out so far there we go see just how launched these particles are so the stat size here is going to be something like 0.5 to 0.6 looks better and the lifetime 0.3 smaller point one point two two point four three two that's pretty I actually really like the look of that for some reason it goes out really far when I try to focus on it so let's try and simulate that that looks awesome okay so I'm really happy with that effect I think we can just go ahead and add this to the other side as well so this this is going to be afterburner one we can duplicate this and do afterburner two actually let's make this left and right so this is going to be afterburner underscore it left and this is going to be afterburner underscore right and we're going to look from the direction of the player here so we are going to inverse the xaxis like that and then we are going to be can maybe just scale it on the X as well that's doing negative here no that doesn't work so we have to inverse on the rotation here as well so let's the upanddown that's going to be fine so the Y here should be shifted a bit and I think that looks pretty great yeah so let's go ahead and see how that looks in the game so close that close that then and that let's hit apply remove the player save and let's hit play LAN host whoops okay so we are definitely flying something is happening here maybe I forgot to remove some script or some swords on these so the thrusters are here you have to burn it yeah there we go they have a physics force and a Collider we want none of that so let's delete them both the physics force and the collider they were adding some kind of force we don't want that to happen so that's it applied to that again say that going and hit play land host it says the reference script on this game behavior is missing so again there is something so let's just move out here find our player graphics play model thrusters it's like both glow objects and let's remove that not that it matters but it's nice to just remove a unnecessary warning that also always feels good so let's apply that delete the player let's try this one last time so let's say play LAN host and now you can see the thrusters are looking great so we can of course get those to vary depending on what we are doing for now I just want them to be a constant thing give the impression that something is holding us up we can definitely also do some hover bouncing or something but we'll see with all of that so that was basically all I could come up with for this tutorial next time will probably take care of the stuff that is currently blocking our screen maybe do something about the environment I don't know so we'll have a see in the next video but thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video
