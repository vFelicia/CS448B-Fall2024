00:00 - one thing that has been a bit confusing
00:02 - the last couple of years was how to deal
00:03 - with 2d lighting in unity unity of
00:06 - course started out as a 3d engine and
00:08 - has since created a bunch of tools to
00:11 - make working with 2d a lot easier
00:13 - however up until this point we've been
00:15 - creating all of our 2d games for a 3d
00:17 - renderer and if we were to use lights
00:19 - they were 3d lights but unity has now
00:22 - created a 2d specific renderer Oh
00:25 - 2d to be this means that lighting is
00:32 - optimized for 2d and that we aren't
00:34 - wasting a bunch of resources on
00:36 - calculating a third dimension the user
00:39 - will never see it also means that unity
00:41 - has created a bunch of 2d specific
00:43 - lights that are much more flexible than
00:45 - 3d lights but before we get too far into
00:47 - it this video is sponsored by Zen ma
00:49 - Academy then where is a unity authorized
00:51 - learning partner which means that the
00:53 - unity curriculums have been reviewed and
00:55 - approved by Unity themselves this
00:58 - ensures top quality courses that will
00:59 - take you all the way from beginner to
01:01 - intermediate and more advanced content
01:03 - the courses are project-based and
01:05 - include everything from 2d 3d AR and VR
01:08 - to making custom avatars and big RPG
01:11 - systems with a one-time payment you get
01:13 - lifetime access to all courses included
01:16 - in a curriculum in course support by
01:18 - expert instructors and by using the
01:20 - coupon code brackets you get 15% off
01:22 - also right now we have a special offer
01:24 - where you can sign up for their five-day
01:26 - unity boot camp for free you can of
01:28 - course do so by clicking the links in
01:30 - the description so lights on It's
01:33 - Showtime so as you can see I've set up
01:36 - this simple example scene here using
01:38 - some of the assets from one of my recent
01:40 - game projects the game is called date
01:42 - night and if you want to see how I made
01:44 - it we have a video showing exactly that
01:46 - of course if you want to use the same
01:48 - example project I'll have a link for
01:49 - that in the description now the first
01:51 - thing that we want to do is make sure
01:52 - that we're using unity 2019 point 2 or
01:55 - later at the time of recording this
01:57 - video this version is currently in beta
01:59 - so I'll be using the beta version we
02:02 - also want to go to window and open up
02:04 - the package manager here we want to
02:06 - select all packages and scroll to the
02:09 - one called
02:09 - lightweight RP for render pipeline let's
02:13 - open this up and choose
02:14 - see all versions and you want to
02:16 - navigate to the latest version here in
02:18 - my case that is six point seven point
02:20 - one and that is the version where these
02:22 - lights are first introduced so you need
02:24 - to make sure that you're using this or
02:25 - later to do that you can simply click it
02:27 - and if it isn't already installed you
02:29 - will have the option to do so here great
02:32 - now we can close down the package
02:33 - manager and we are now ready to set up
02:35 - our project to use the lightweight
02:36 - render pipeline to do this let's go edit
02:39 - let's navigate to our project settings
02:41 - I'm gonna go to the graphics tab here
02:44 - and as you can see there's a slot here
02:45 - for a render pipeline asset and in my
02:48 - case this is empty if you already have a
02:50 - pipeline asset here that's great in my
02:53 - case I do not so I'm gonna go ahead and
02:54 - create one to do this we'll go to the
02:56 - project hit create go on the rendering
02:59 - lightweight render pipeline and select
03:01 - the pipeline asset and I'm just gonna
03:03 - call it
03:03 - WIP asset when then take this asset and
03:07 - drag it into the slot and that's all for
03:09 - our project settings a UND project is
03:11 - now using lightweight
03:13 - however lightweight can be used for both
03:15 - 3d and 2d games so we want to let
03:18 - lightweight know that we are working in
03:20 - 2d to do this we can select the LWR P
03:23 - asset that we just created and here we
03:25 - have a bunch of settings for configuring
03:27 - lightweight in our case we want to
03:29 - change the renderer type from forward
03:31 - renderer which say three-dimensional
03:33 - renderer to a custom renderer so now we
03:36 - have a slot where we can input a custom
03:38 - renderer and this is where the cool part
03:40 - comes because unity has now created a
03:42 - 2-d specific renderer so to use this
03:44 - we'll go create rendering lightweight
03:47 - render pipeline and let's select the 2d
03:49 - renderer let's just call it to the
03:51 - renderer let's select our L WRP acid and
03:54 - drag that in as our data and voila now
03:58 - unity will only render to the lights of
04:01 - course nothing is happening in our scene
04:03 - so it isn't that magical yet and the
04:07 - reason for this is that all of our
04:08 - different sprites here are all using the
04:10 - default sprites material which is an
04:13 - unlit material so it won't react to
04:15 - lighting at all however if we go ahead
04:17 - and drag in a new sprite so I'm just
04:19 - gonna select any of the sprites in my
04:21 - folder here you will see that it's
04:23 - completely black because we don't have
04:25 - any lights in our scene you can also see
04:27 - that on amateur
04:28 - it's using sprite lid default so all we
04:31 - need to do is change this on all of our
04:33 - different objects and you Lee has
04:34 - created a really easy way for us to do
04:36 - this simply go edit render pipeline
04:39 - lightweight render pipeline 2d renderer
04:41 - and here we can upgrade our scene to the
04:44 - 2d renderer let's click that hit proceed
04:46 - and as you can see it tells us the name
04:48 - of all the objects that was upgraded and
04:50 - upgraded just means it swapped out the
04:53 - material and if we clear that and have a
04:55 - look at our scene it's completely black
04:57 - so we're now ready to add lights
05:00 - interest scene and let's start with a
05:02 - point light so let's right click in our
05:04 - hierarchy go light 2d and let's select a
05:08 - point light as you can see it
05:09 - immediately appears here the radius
05:12 - isn't that big so I'm gonna go ahead and
05:14 - increase it and when I do we can see
05:16 - more and more of our level however you
05:18 - will notice that our background still
05:20 - appears completely black the reason for
05:23 - this is that two tea lights allow us to
05:25 - choose what sorting layers to target
05:27 - this is a really cool feature because it
05:29 - gives us a lot of control however it
05:31 - also means that we need to go in here
05:32 - and include all of our target sorting
05:35 - layers for this light and we now see the
05:37 - light spilling on to our foreground and
05:39 - background as well so I'm gonna use this
05:41 - as the light emitting from the candle of
05:44 - our dinner here so I'm gonna move it up
05:46 - I'm also going to increase the outer
05:48 - radius a bit more and as you can see we
05:50 - can also play with the inner radius to
05:52 - fill this out in any way that we'd like
05:53 - I'm just gonna leave that at zero for
05:55 - now we also play around with the
05:57 - fall-off intensity which allows us to
05:59 - kind of smooth out the effect and as
06:01 - with all other lights we have an
06:03 - intensity slider as well as the ability
06:05 - to adjust color so in my case I'm gonna
06:07 - make this way more orange I think that
06:10 - looks pretty cool and we now have kind
06:13 - of the effect of a candlelight you also
06:15 - notice that anything that isn't
06:16 - currently being lid is completely black
06:19 - now this might be something that you
06:20 - wanted some cases but here I think it's
06:23 - a bit too much so to fix this let's go
06:26 - ahead and add a light 2d global light
06:29 - this is simply going to shine light
06:31 - uniformly onto all selected objects so
06:34 - again I'm going to target all sorting
06:36 - layers and I'm simply going to decrease
06:38 - the intensity here to something like 0.3
06:40 - and
06:41 - I'm also going to change the color to
06:42 - kind of a dusty purple I think that
06:45 - gives a pretty cool dungeon a look that
06:47 - definitely already looks a lot better so
06:50 - what else can we add to this scene well
06:52 - let's go in and let's duplicate our
06:53 - point light by simply hitting ctrl D
06:56 - let's move this over to the blue
06:58 - platform let's change the color here to
07:00 - a light blue and right away I think that
07:04 - looks pretty cool I'm gonna do the same
07:05 - thing but for our purple platform and
07:08 - change the hue to a bright purple there
07:11 - we go that already looks so much better
07:13 - in fact a really cool thing about these
07:15 - point lights is that they can also be
07:17 - used as spotlights simply duplicate this
07:20 - one I'm gonna change the color here to
07:22 - or more yellowy tint and we can simply
07:25 - click and drag on any one of these
07:27 - points to change the angle and we have
07:31 - both an inner and an outer angle if we
07:33 - want to create a bit of feathering and
07:35 - right away we have a point light pretty
07:38 - cool now I'm just gonna go ahead and
07:39 - remove this from my scene here and let's
07:42 - try and create a new light and this one
07:44 - is going to be a sprite light so sprite
07:47 - lights
07:47 - as the name suggests basically allow us
07:49 - to input a sprite that will light up our
07:52 - scene in my case I've gone ahead and
07:54 - found this sprite cookie this was part
07:56 - of some 2d light samples that you only
07:58 - put on github I'll of course have a link
08:00 - for that in the description as well and
08:01 - it works really well if we simply drag
08:03 - this into the sprite slot and change the
08:06 - target sorting layers to all and right
08:09 - away we can see the sprite kind of
08:10 - appearing on top of our scene and
08:12 - illuminating the objects now I'm just
08:14 - gonna put this on top of our blue player
08:16 - here I'm gonna change the color to a
08:18 - bluish tint and now it looks like a blue
08:21 - player is shining pretty cool and let's
08:23 - just do the same thing for our pink one
08:26 - awesome now a really cool light type
08:29 - that is specific to 2d is the new
08:31 - freeform light so if we right click go
08:34 - light 2d and choose freeform this light
08:38 - basically allows us to draw the shape of
08:41 - our own light I think you can do some
08:43 - really really cool things with this if
08:45 - for example we wanted to have a pit of
08:47 - acid at the bottom of a level here well
08:50 - then we could simply draw in the light
08:53 - for this pit of acid
08:55 - so I do some kind of a square here it
08:58 - goes up to around here and of course you
09:01 - can add as many points as you'd like for
09:03 - this or simply select and delete them
09:06 - and when you're done simply stop editing
09:08 - this shape we then select all for our
09:10 - sorting layers you can now see that it's
09:12 - illuminating our scene for the color
09:14 - here I'm gonna change that to a green
09:16 - for that acid look we also play around
09:19 - with the fall-off in order to kind of
09:21 - adjust the fade that we're getting now
09:23 - as you can see it kind of looks like we
09:25 - have this light shining from beneath
09:27 - across this entire section really really
09:30 - cool and the final light that we have if
09:32 - we go under light 2d is the parametric
09:35 - light and this basically allows us to
09:38 - create light shapes with X amount of
09:40 - corners so if we just set this to all as
09:42 - you can see we now have a five sided
09:45 - polygon as our light and we can go in
09:48 - and adjust the amount of sides so now we
09:50 - have a triangle we can also do a square
09:52 - and pretty much just keep going I'm just
09:55 - gonna leave this at five sides and put
09:57 - it in the middle here and as always we
09:59 - have a radius as well as some fall-off
10:01 - we can also adjust the angle as you can
10:03 - see there's plenty of fun stuff that you
10:05 - can do with this however I don't think
10:08 - it suits this scene so I'm just gonna go
10:09 - ahead and delete it also I think our
10:12 - asset light down here cuts off a bit too
10:13 - quick so I'm just going to increase the
10:15 - fall-off a bit more that looks a lot
10:17 - better now one of the things that is
10:19 - really cool about this new system is
10:21 - that it's now a lot easier to work with
10:23 - normal Maps yes finally if for example
10:27 - we wanted to apply a normal map to the
10:29 - stones in the background here all we
10:31 - need to do is simply select our
10:32 - background go to the sprite editor and
10:35 - here we now have a new option called
10:37 - secondary textures if we hit the plus
10:41 - sign here and this needs to be exact so
10:43 - underscore normal map just like this you
10:46 - can't name it anything that you want you
10:48 - need to name it exactly this and then
10:51 - specify a texture and I've of course
10:53 - gone ahead and created a normal map
10:55 - version of this background so I'm simply
10:57 - going to drag that in and hit apply of
10:59 - course make sure to select all normal
11:01 - Maps you're using and set the texture
11:03 - type to normal map now type the show
11:05 - inside of our scene we need to select
11:07 - our light
11:08 - I'm just gonna exclude the global light
11:10 - here and as your discovery there is a
11:12 - checkbox here called use normal map so
11:15 - this of course allows you to choose if
11:16 - you want your lights to be affected by
11:17 - normal Maps or not in this case we'll
11:19 - simply set that to true as you can see
11:21 - right away we really clearly get that
11:24 - normal mapped effect I'm just gonna go
11:26 - ahead and increase the distance here to
11:28 - lower the effect a bit and right away I
11:30 - think that looks really cool awesome now
11:33 - just to show you the effects of adding a
11:34 - normal map more clearly I've gone ahead
11:36 - and created this simple space example
11:38 - all this has is a space background as
11:41 - well as a rock that is kind of just
11:44 - floating around here I've also gone it
11:46 - and added a global light that just gives
11:48 - a bit of light to the background here it
11:50 - does nothing for the rock and then a
11:52 - point light that is affecting the rock
11:55 - only and as you can see it looks fine
11:57 - when we're moving around the light but
11:59 - the rock definitely does not look
12:00 - three-dimensional so to have our light
12:02 - bounce more realistically off the rock
12:05 - I've gone ahead and added a normal map
12:07 - in the exact same way that we did with
12:09 - the background so going into the sprite
12:12 - editor going on the secondary textures
12:13 - and simply adding it in here with the
12:16 - name underscore normal map and now if we
12:18 - go to a point light here and choose use
12:21 - normal map we can see just how much
12:24 - three-dimensional character this really
12:26 - brings out in our rock we can see light
12:29 - way more realistically bouncing off
12:31 - these different surfaces of a rock
12:34 - really cool and this rock is also part
12:37 - of the two dissembles that unity put up
12:39 - again link for that in the description
12:41 - so now we have a lit scene in unity that
12:43 - is fully 2d using the new 2d renderer
12:46 - really cool so that's pretty much it for
12:49 - this video now I think there are
12:50 - definitely some things that could help
12:52 - improve this new 2d lighting system most
12:54 - of them are smaller ui/ux changes to
12:56 - make things feel more polished and I'm
12:58 - sure those are coming soon however one
13:00 - big thing for me would be shadows that
13:02 - are based on the shape of sprites
13:04 - similar to an acid like 2d DL luckily I
13:07 - went to the Unity forums and found this
13:08 - reply that indicates that shadows are
13:10 - planned for later this year so I'm
13:12 - definitely looking forward to that also

Cleaned transcript:

one thing that has been a bit confusing the last couple of years was how to deal with 2d lighting in unity unity of course started out as a 3d engine and has since created a bunch of tools to make working with 2d a lot easier however up until this point we've been creating all of our 2d games for a 3d renderer and if we were to use lights they were 3d lights but unity has now created a 2d

unity has created a bunch of 2d specific lights that are much more flexible than 3d lights but before we get too far into it this video is sponsored by Zen ma Academy then where is a unity authorized learning partner which means that the unity curriculums have been reviewed and approved by Unity themselves this ensures top quality courses that will take you all the way from beginner to intermediate and more advanced content the courses are projectbased and include everything from 2d 3d AR and VR to making custom avatars and big RPG systems with a onetime payment you get lifetime access to all courses included in a curriculum in course support by expert instructors and by using the coupon code brackets you get 15% off also right now we have a special offer where you can sign up for their fiveday unity boot camp for free you can of course do so by clicking the links in the description so lights on It's Showtime so as you can see I've set up this simple example scene here using some of the assets from one of my recent game projects the game is called date night and if you want to see how I made it we have a video showing exactly that of course if you want to use the same example project I'll have a link for that in the description now the first thing that we want to do is make sure that we're using unity 2019 point 2 or later at the time of recording this video this version is currently in beta so I'll be using the beta version we also want to go to window and open up the package manager here we want to select all packages and scroll to the one called lightweight RP for render pipeline let's open this up and choose see all versions and you want to navigate to the latest version here in my case that is six point seven point one and that is the version where these lights are first introduced so you need to make sure that you're using this or later to do that you can simply click it and if it isn't already installed you will have the option to do so here great now we can close down the package manager and we are now ready to set up our project to use the lightweight render pipeline to do this let's go edit let's navigate to our project settings I'm gonna go to the graphics tab here and as you can see there's a slot here for a render pipeline asset and in my case this is empty if you already have a pipeline asset here that's great in my case I do not so I'm gonna go ahead and create one to do this we'll go to the project hit create go on the rendering lightweight render pipeline and select the pipeline asset and I'm just gonna call it WIP asset when then take this asset and drag it into the slot and that's all for our project settings a UND project is now using lightweight however lightweight can be used for both 3d and 2d games so we want to let lightweight know that we are working in 2d to do this we can select the LWR P asset that we just created and here we have a bunch of settings for configuring lightweight in our case we want to change the renderer type from forward renderer which say threedimensional renderer to a custom renderer so now we have a slot where we can input a custom renderer and this is where the cool part comes because unity has now created a 2d specific renderer so to use this we'll go create rendering lightweight render pipeline and let's select the 2d renderer let's just call it to the renderer let's select our L WRP acid and drag that in as our data and voila now unity will only render to the lights of course nothing is happening in our scene so it isn't that magical yet and the reason for this is that all of our different sprites here are all using the default sprites material which is an unlit material so it won't react to lighting at all however if we go ahead and drag in a new sprite so I'm just gonna select any of the sprites in my folder here you will see that it's completely black because we don't have any lights in our scene you can also see that on amateur it's using sprite lid default so all we need to do is change this on all of our different objects and you Lee has created a really easy way for us to do this simply go edit render pipeline lightweight render pipeline 2d renderer and here we can upgrade our scene to the 2d renderer let's click that hit proceed and as you can see it tells us the name of all the objects that was upgraded and upgraded just means it swapped out the material and if we clear that and have a look at our scene it's completely black so we're now ready to add lights interest scene and let's start with a point light so let's right click in our hierarchy go light 2d and let's select a point light as you can see it immediately appears here the radius isn't that big so I'm gonna go ahead and increase it and when I do we can see more and more of our level however you will notice that our background still appears completely black the reason for this is that two tea lights allow us to choose what sorting layers to target this is a really cool feature because it gives us a lot of control however it also means that we need to go in here and include all of our target sorting layers for this light and we now see the light spilling on to our foreground and background as well so I'm gonna use this as the light emitting from the candle of our dinner here so I'm gonna move it up I'm also going to increase the outer radius a bit more and as you can see we can also play with the inner radius to fill this out in any way that we'd like I'm just gonna leave that at zero for now we also play around with the falloff intensity which allows us to kind of smooth out the effect and as with all other lights we have an intensity slider as well as the ability to adjust color so in my case I'm gonna make this way more orange I think that looks pretty cool and we now have kind of the effect of a candlelight you also notice that anything that isn't currently being lid is completely black now this might be something that you wanted some cases but here I think it's a bit too much so to fix this let's go ahead and add a light 2d global light this is simply going to shine light uniformly onto all selected objects so again I'm going to target all sorting layers and I'm simply going to decrease the intensity here to something like 0.3 and I'm also going to change the color to kind of a dusty purple I think that gives a pretty cool dungeon a look that definitely already looks a lot better so what else can we add to this scene well let's go in and let's duplicate our point light by simply hitting ctrl D let's move this over to the blue platform let's change the color here to a light blue and right away I think that looks pretty cool I'm gonna do the same thing but for our purple platform and change the hue to a bright purple there we go that already looks so much better in fact a really cool thing about these point lights is that they can also be used as spotlights simply duplicate this one I'm gonna change the color here to or more yellowy tint and we can simply click and drag on any one of these points to change the angle and we have both an inner and an outer angle if we want to create a bit of feathering and right away we have a point light pretty cool now I'm just gonna go ahead and remove this from my scene here and let's try and create a new light and this one is going to be a sprite light so sprite lights as the name suggests basically allow us to input a sprite that will light up our scene in my case I've gone ahead and found this sprite cookie this was part of some 2d light samples that you only put on github I'll of course have a link for that in the description as well and it works really well if we simply drag this into the sprite slot and change the target sorting layers to all and right away we can see the sprite kind of appearing on top of our scene and illuminating the objects now I'm just gonna put this on top of our blue player here I'm gonna change the color to a bluish tint and now it looks like a blue player is shining pretty cool and let's just do the same thing for our pink one awesome now a really cool light type that is specific to 2d is the new freeform light so if we right click go light 2d and choose freeform this light basically allows us to draw the shape of our own light I think you can do some really really cool things with this if for example we wanted to have a pit of acid at the bottom of a level here well then we could simply draw in the light for this pit of acid so I do some kind of a square here it goes up to around here and of course you can add as many points as you'd like for this or simply select and delete them and when you're done simply stop editing this shape we then select all for our sorting layers you can now see that it's illuminating our scene for the color here I'm gonna change that to a green for that acid look we also play around with the falloff in order to kind of adjust the fade that we're getting now as you can see it kind of looks like we have this light shining from beneath across this entire section really really cool and the final light that we have if we go under light 2d is the parametric light and this basically allows us to create light shapes with X amount of corners so if we just set this to all as you can see we now have a five sided polygon as our light and we can go in and adjust the amount of sides so now we have a triangle we can also do a square and pretty much just keep going I'm just gonna leave this at five sides and put it in the middle here and as always we have a radius as well as some falloff we can also adjust the angle as you can see there's plenty of fun stuff that you can do with this however I don't think it suits this scene so I'm just gonna go ahead and delete it also I think our asset light down here cuts off a bit too quick so I'm just going to increase the falloff a bit more that looks a lot better now one of the things that is really cool about this new system is that it's now a lot easier to work with normal Maps yes finally if for example we wanted to apply a normal map to the stones in the background here all we need to do is simply select our background go to the sprite editor and here we now have a new option called secondary textures if we hit the plus sign here and this needs to be exact so underscore normal map just like this you can't name it anything that you want you need to name it exactly this and then specify a texture and I've of course gone ahead and created a normal map version of this background so I'm simply going to drag that in and hit apply of course make sure to select all normal Maps you're using and set the texture type to normal map now type the show inside of our scene we need to select our light I'm just gonna exclude the global light here and as your discovery there is a checkbox here called use normal map so this of course allows you to choose if you want your lights to be affected by normal Maps or not in this case we'll simply set that to true as you can see right away we really clearly get that normal mapped effect I'm just gonna go ahead and increase the distance here to lower the effect a bit and right away I think that looks really cool awesome now just to show you the effects of adding a normal map more clearly I've gone ahead and created this simple space example all this has is a space background as well as a rock that is kind of just floating around here I've also gone it and added a global light that just gives a bit of light to the background here it does nothing for the rock and then a point light that is affecting the rock only and as you can see it looks fine when we're moving around the light but the rock definitely does not look threedimensional so to have our light bounce more realistically off the rock I've gone ahead and added a normal map in the exact same way that we did with the background so going into the sprite editor going on the secondary textures and simply adding it in here with the name underscore normal map and now if we go to a point light here and choose use normal map we can see just how much threedimensional character this really brings out in our rock we can see light way more realistically bouncing off these different surfaces of a rock really cool and this rock is also part of the two dissembles that unity put up again link for that in the description so now we have a lit scene in unity that is fully 2d using the new 2d renderer really cool so that's pretty much it for this video now I think there are definitely some things that could help improve this new 2d lighting system most of them are smaller ui/ux changes to make things feel more polished and I'm sure those are coming soon however one big thing for me would be shadows that are based on the shape of sprites similar to an acid like 2d DL luckily I went to the Unity forums and found this reply that indicates that shadows are planned for later this year so I'm definitely looking forward to that also don't forget to check out Zander Academy get 15% off with the coupon code practice and sign up for their fiveday
