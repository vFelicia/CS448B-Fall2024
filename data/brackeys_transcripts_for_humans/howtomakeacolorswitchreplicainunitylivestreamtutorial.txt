00:00 - hello everyone welcome to this video
00:01 - this is a live stream tutorial on
00:03 - creating a replica of color switch which
00:05 - is a really fun minigame that you can
00:08 - see our works here so if I hit play here
00:10 - you can see that we have this bowl that
00:12 - we can control by pressing the spacebar
00:14 - in order to drum it's very much like
00:16 - flappy bird in this regard and we can
00:19 - jump up here we can only pass through
00:21 - the color that we currently have our
00:23 - ball and you can see a ball can change
00:25 - color along the way so I need to get up
00:28 - here and kind of time it correctly and
00:30 - you can also see that we have a little
00:31 - bug here where we can actually change to
00:34 - the same color that we're already on but
00:36 - we can have a look at changing that and
00:38 - it's it's really a game that you should
00:40 - expand upon in order to make more fun
00:42 - out of but I just want to show you how
00:44 - you can create these basic mechanics in
00:46 - the color changing and hit registration
00:49 - and you can really easily expand upon it
00:51 - to create more levels more shapes maybe
00:54 - even more colors and definitely some
00:56 - power-ups some scores and some cool
01:00 - death particle effects that's that's not
01:02 - a stuff to do here but today we'll just
01:04 - get out the core game so let's just go
01:08 - ahead and get started with this so let's
01:09 - go file new project and we want to of
01:13 - course create a 2d project and let's
01:15 - call this one color switch replica there
01:20 - we go and unity is just going to boot up
01:23 - all of the necessary files in the
01:26 - background here and meanwhile I'm going
01:27 - to have a look in the chat to see how
01:28 - everyone is doing is it infinite no it's
01:32 - not infinite I've done it you could very
01:35 - easily go ahead and make this
01:36 - procedurally generated simply
01:38 - instantiate in circles using some kind
01:40 - of random prefabs selected from an array
01:44 - or I could go the route that I'm doing
01:46 - here which is just allowing you to
01:48 - create your own levels but you can do
01:51 - anything like that it's it's really easy
01:53 - to add procedural generation to this so
01:56 - um and hi to everyone who is joining a
01:58 - lot of people tuning in that's awesome
02:00 - so on let's begin by kind of changing
02:03 - our background here to a darkish gray
02:06 - something like that not too inspiring
02:08 - but we want all of our colors to be
02:10 - overlaid on top let's also go ahead and
02:13 - save the
02:13 - seen here because I am a chronic saver
02:16 - and I cannot stop myself from hitting
02:18 - ctrl s let's go and save it as something
02:20 - like mane so that I can span that along
02:23 - the way and let me see
02:26 - oops I have something open here that I
02:28 - want to close there we go so um the
02:31 - first thing that we could go ahead and
02:32 - do here is maybe create the movement of
02:35 - our player so in order to do that let's
02:37 - go and create a new 2d object sprite and
02:42 - the sprite that we want to select here
02:43 - is the knob we can use that you can also
02:46 - create your own circular sprite and I
02:49 - want to set the scale here to something
02:51 - like 2 by 2 maybe 3 by 3 I don't want it
02:55 - to be too big and the color here we'll
02:57 - just stay white for now but you do want
02:59 - the base sprite to be white so that you
03:01 - can tint it during the game if the base
03:04 - flag was black we wouldn't be able to
03:06 - change the color so you can of course
03:08 - also have multiple sprites that you swap
03:11 - in and out but we'll just be tending
03:12 - this one sprite so you can see now here
03:15 - that we now can actually control the
03:16 - color as we want and we can do that at
03:19 - run time as well so let's go ahead and
03:21 - rename this guy to player and let's also
03:23 - add a new component and the component
03:25 - that we want to add is is a custom see
03:29 - sharp script called player and let's hit
03:32 - create a net and let's double click this
03:34 - to open it up in Visual Studio
03:39 - I hope you guys didn't miss too much all
03:42 - we did was create a player script and in
03:45 - here we deleted the start method and the
03:48 - to using system tags up here and we of
03:51 - course plays the script on the player
03:52 - and now we are creating a variable
03:55 - called jump force it's a public float
03:58 - and I'll just default this to ten and
04:00 - this is of course the height that you
04:01 - will jump and then we also need a
04:05 - reference to our rigidbody we'll be
04:07 - creating a rigidbody on the object in
04:08 - just a second and you can use get
04:10 - components for this but I'm just going
04:12 - to go ahead and make a public rigidbody
04:14 - 2d and call it something like RB so we
04:16 - can just drag it in in the inspector
04:18 - then in the update method will check if
04:21 - input does get button-down and the
04:24 - button that we want to check for here is
04:27 - jump we could also go ahead and maybe
04:29 - check for a mouse click if you want to
04:31 - use that button instead so I'm going to
04:32 - go input dot get mouse button down and
04:36 - the mouse button that we want to check
04:37 - for is zero meaning be a left mouse
04:40 - button cool so oh and we don't want this
04:43 - to be and we want this to be or so two
04:45 - vertical bars so that either one of
04:47 - these will trigger cone then we want to
04:50 - go ahead and jump and we do this by
04:52 - saying RB dot and we could go in here
04:55 - and add a force in the upwards direction
04:57 - using our jump force but that is
05:00 - actually not give us these going to give
05:02 - us the logic that we want because if we
05:05 - go ahead and play the mobile game or
05:06 - flappy bird for that matter these games
05:09 - instead of adding a force simply change
05:12 - the velocity of the player because if
05:15 - the player falls a certain distance we
05:18 - don't want the force to be to be
05:20 - competing with this downwards velocity
05:23 - instead we just want to completely
05:25 - ignore that and then give him a straight
05:27 - upwards velocity and that's going to
05:29 - give more much more predictable movement
05:31 - so we're going to instead going to go in
05:34 - here and say I'll be dubbed the velocity
05:36 - and set this directly to a vector to dot
05:40 - up multiplied with our jump force like
05:45 - that cool so now if we just go in here
05:49 - and save that we'll also go in and
05:52 - add a new component and we're going to
05:54 - add the red lips
05:56 - the rigidbody2d and also a circle
06:00 - Collider 2d and the circle Collider we
06:03 - are going to mark as a trigger and we
06:05 - also want to adjust this so I'm going to
06:07 - say point zero nine and zero eight I
06:10 - like this to be kind of a bit inside of
06:15 - the actual graphic so that you're
06:17 - certain that you won't have a situation
06:19 - where the player when I made that and he
06:22 - really did so you want that to be
06:24 - normally a bit narrower than the
06:26 - graphics of the circle and then the
06:29 - rigidbody here I'm going to bump up the
06:31 - gravity to three just to make him fall a
06:33 - bit quicker I find that that just makes
06:35 - the game feel more interesting and we
06:38 - can then take a rigidbody and drag that
06:40 - into the RB slot so now when we hit play
06:43 - we should see that we are able to yeh
06:46 - click a mouse or use our jump button in
06:49 - order to have this jumping movement and
06:53 - it's actually already really fun to do
06:55 - this so I could do this flowers
06:58 - anyways so um other than that that's not
07:02 - too much we need to do you could go into
07:04 - the rigidbody 2d here and add a
07:06 - constraint on the x-axis and also freeze
07:09 - rotation around the z just to make sure
07:12 - that our player will always only move up
07:14 - on the Y no matter what happens it's
07:16 - just good practice and then what we want
07:20 - to do is of course have some kind of
07:23 - rotating color wheel and you can make
07:27 - this a triangle you can make it a square
07:29 - some kind of pulley he'd roll publish
07:32 - something with polygon and you could
07:35 - also make it a circle it's totally up to
07:38 - you I simply went into Photoshop here
07:41 - and created this circle here which using
07:44 - the rulers which you can get like this I
07:47 - split up into four different parts one
07:51 - is sine one is yellow one magenta and
07:53 - one pink and I then copied this into
07:57 - three different sizes and made sure that
08:00 - the thickness of the line was always the
08:03 - same and then you can go ahead and X
08:05 - or any one of these elements so one by
08:07 - one exploit these into a sprite or you
08:10 - could go and make a sprite sheet out of
08:14 - this by simply separating all of them
08:16 - into kind of a on single image like this
08:20 - to make sure that you can splice it up
08:22 - any way that you want so I went ahead
08:24 - and did this to the small circle and
08:26 - that's what I have lying on my desktop
08:30 - here so this is just four parts of a
08:33 - circle that I've separated out a little
08:34 - bit and colored in four different colors
08:37 - and again if you want to follow your
08:39 - along using my version of this I will
08:42 - have it up on github
08:43 - when the video goes live on youtube so
08:46 - don't worry about that that will be a
08:48 - link in the description if you are
08:49 - watching this on YouTube cool so in here
08:53 - we don't need to configure too many
08:55 - settings pretty much the only thing that
08:57 - we need to do is change the sprite mode
08:59 - from single to multiple because we have
09:01 - four sprites in here and we need to go
09:02 - into the sprite editor hit apply and we
09:05 - then need to go up here and say slice
09:07 - and then slice and now you can see that
09:10 - we've sliced it unity has sliced this
09:13 - into four sprites and if we apply now it
09:16 - is going to be visible in the project
09:19 - panel as well we now have one two three
09:21 - four circle parts here so really quick
09:24 - and easy to do now we want to take all
09:26 - these circle parts and drag them into
09:28 - the unity editor to play with into our
09:31 - scene view here and we can maybe take
09:33 - all them and actually we'll move these
09:36 - in a second we'll take our player for
09:37 - now and drag them down a bit and for the
09:40 - circle talks here we need to let's see
09:44 - we need to set these up so that they
09:46 - align so let's take our first one or
09:48 - which is the second one here the one
09:50 - with index one drag that over until they
09:54 - align and I'm just going to do this
09:56 - using the measurement of my eye but you
09:58 - can of course go in here and do the math
10:02 - I think that's fine then we're going to
10:05 - take the I think it's this one nope the
10:08 - magenta one which is this one and we
10:11 - need that to have the same x value as
10:13 - the yellow one so let's copy the X here
10:16 - paste it over here and now we can take
10:19 - these last two ones the pink and the
10:21 - magenta and we can move those down
10:23 - together they're awesome and now we have
10:27 - a circle split up into four different
10:29 - colors and again be precise with this
10:32 - but because we on stream I'm just doing
10:34 - this really quickly so now we can go
10:37 - ahead and create an empty object and
10:39 - we'll reset the transform on that and
10:40 - we'll call this one something like a
10:42 - small circle in one word I'm going to do
10:47 - that cool and we can take all of our
10:49 - parts and put that those inside of this
10:52 - small circle here and we can also align
10:55 - these to the center so I'm just going to
10:57 - use the points where the color split
11:01 - here in order to align it to the center
11:03 - that would be there and there cool so
11:08 - now we have all of these different parts
11:10 - inside of a parent object called small
11:12 - circle that we can place anywhere we
11:13 - would like and when we now go ahead and
11:15 - rotate this parent object around the
11:18 - z-axis we should see that our color
11:21 - wheel is rotating along awesome just the
11:25 - way we wanted so we could go in here and
11:29 - rename the different circle parts now
11:30 - just to make everything a bit easier so
11:32 - let's name this one cyan this one yellow
11:36 - this one pink and this one magenta and
11:42 - I'm going to drag the magenta up here so
11:43 - it's right before the pink one and we
11:47 - need to select all of these different
11:48 - parts now and add some colliders so
11:50 - let's go in here and add some polygon
11:52 - colliders and this is not particularly
11:54 - pretty I will give you that but I
11:57 - actually found that it's the only
11:58 - Collider that kind of works for this
12:00 - instance because the circle Collider
12:02 - does never radius or I mean I doesn't
12:05 - have a width you can see that doesn't
12:08 - really work for our case we also have
12:11 - the box colliders but it's spending we
12:14 - could reduce experiment with some edge
12:16 - colliders that might produce
12:18 - alright-alright results here but we
12:21 - would have to configure these quite a
12:22 - bit so it's not really too much yeah
12:26 - that works better than the polygon
12:28 - colliders here so I think we'll just go
12:30 - with that we can take our play here and
12:32 - shrink
12:33 - down the radius of him even more to
12:36 - adjust for any kind of errors it doesn't
12:39 - have to be too precise they don't think
12:40 - for this kind of game cool so now we
12:44 - need to of course rotate our circle over
12:46 - time so to do that we're going to hear
12:48 - me add a component on a small circle
12:50 - called the rotator and this is also
12:53 - going to be a c-sharp script and let's
12:56 - double click that to open it up in
12:58 - visual studio reload all and everything
13:00 - is good we can delete the two using
13:02 - system tags up there again and we can
13:04 - also delete this start method once more
13:06 - we do need a public float here and this
13:09 - is going to be the rotation speed and
13:11 - I'm just going to call this one speed
13:12 - and the fold it to maybe something like
13:14 - a hundred so that means that we're going
13:16 - to move a hundred degrees every second
13:22 - so now inside of our update we can take
13:24 - the transform of our current object that
13:26 - the rotator script is sitting on and we
13:29 - can use the rotate method in order to
13:31 - rotate it around its center and we want
13:34 - to rotate it zero on the X 0 on the Y
13:38 - and we want to rotate it our speed on
13:41 - the Z multiplied with and this is
13:44 - important that you write time Delta time
13:47 - in order to make sure that we even out
13:49 - differences in frame rate I've talked
13:52 - about time to does a time a bunch of
13:54 - times if you want to get a better
13:55 - understanding of it I suggest you check
13:57 - out the on unity tutorial on a bullet
14:01 - time effect or slow motion that I have
14:03 - on my youtube channel there we go into
14:05 - time that does a time what it means
14:07 - versus time dot fixed of the time and
14:10 - all these different time related stuff
14:13 - so check that out if you want for now
14:15 - just make sure to write it here because
14:17 - then our speed our rotation speed won't
14:20 - be frame rate on dependent cool so now
14:24 - that we save that that should actually
14:25 - be all we need to do for our rotator
14:27 - script it's just hitting play and it's
14:31 - rotating and we also of course have our
14:33 - player movement working so yeah we have
14:36 - something that somewhat resembles a game
14:38 - already only thing is of course we
14:41 - aren't really able to lose or win but
14:44 - let's just call it a game
14:46 - we can call this one interactive art for
14:49 - now so now we need to take our player
14:51 - here and make sure that it will always
14:52 - be drawn on top of everything else that
14:54 - we make in order to do that let's create
14:56 - a new sorting layer and it's called this
14:58 - one the player layer and we'll select a
15:02 - player and apply that sorting layer
15:05 - there now we are sure that he is always
15:08 - going to draw on top um then we can go
15:12 - ahead and make the actual hit
15:13 - registration and we do have colliders on
15:16 - our different circle elements and we
15:19 - also have a Collider on our player so
15:21 - all we need to do now is go inside of
15:23 - our player script and you could
15:25 - definitely put this inside of a separate
15:26 - script and I'll create a method that
15:30 - will register whenever we collide with
15:32 - something and we know that method
15:34 - it's one of unity spilled in callback
15:37 - methods it's on trigger entered 2d and
15:41 - you use 2d here every time you're
15:43 - dealing with 2d colliders if not used to
15:46 - delete that and you have the 3d
15:47 - equivalent so Ontario into 2d is going
15:50 - to be called every time we collide with
15:52 - something and um what we want to do is
15:55 - gather some information about what we
15:58 - collided with because whether or not we
16:00 - lose or succeed totally depends on what
16:04 - color the object we collided with this
16:06 - and we're going to define the color of
16:08 - the object using a tag so we want to
16:11 - check first of all I gather some
16:13 - information about what we hit and then
16:16 - check if that tag is the same color as
16:18 - ours and if it is not well then we
16:21 - messed up so in order to gather some
16:23 - information about what we hit we create
16:26 - a variable here called collided to or of
16:28 - type Collider 2d and we can call it
16:30 - something like Cole let's refer to it as
16:34 - called
16:34 - meaning they Collider that we just hit
16:37 - and then we check if Cole
16:39 - tack is equal to whatever color we
16:44 - currently have so now we can just go
16:46 - ahead and debug the log call dot tag and
16:49 - that means that whenever we collide with
16:51 - something we're going to write its tag
16:53 - in the console so now inside of unity we
16:57 - can go ahead and hit play and we should
16:59 - see that
17:00 - every time we collide with one of these
17:02 - things it's going to say on tags because
17:04 - we haven't applied a tag yet then for
17:07 - each circle element we can go ahead and
17:09 - add a new tag I mean I can go ahead and
17:12 - add all of the different colors to this
17:14 - tax rate we have this sign we have the
17:17 - yellow we have the magenta and the pink
17:24 - cool so now for the sign we'll add the
17:27 - sign for the yellow we'll add the yellow
17:30 - the magenta we'll add the pink and
17:33 - screaming will add the magenta and for
17:35 - the pink will add the pink code so now
17:39 - we have all these different objects with
17:41 - the correct tax applied and yes you
17:44 - could go ahead and use the name instead
17:47 - of the tag it's a bit maybe a bit too
17:49 - much that I have all them change names
17:52 - as well as tags but I think it's better
17:55 - to use tags because then you are
17:56 - reducing the amount of places that you
17:59 - could arm that you could mess up your
18:03 - writing so definitely recommend using
18:07 - using text for this so inside a visual
18:10 - studio we can now check okay let's just
18:13 - see if this is working first so we apply
18:16 - here and we collide with Sian it's a
18:18 - scientifical ID with yellow magenta it
18:20 - says yellow and magenta and the same
18:22 - thing with the pink cool so now inside
18:26 - the visual studio we can check if Cole
18:29 - tag is equal to and then we can check if
18:33 - it's equal to yellow we can check if
18:36 - it's equal to magenta and you get the
18:38 - idea
18:39 - however we of course need to define a
18:42 - color for a player in order to to do
18:45 - this check so how do we assign a color
18:48 - to all players well there is a bunch of
18:51 - different ways that you can do this and
18:52 - this might not be the prettiest but it's
18:54 - really easy to understand and quick to
18:57 - set up so this is probably the way that
18:59 - I would go about it if I was doing a gem
19:01 - and that is simply keeping all of the
19:04 - code inside of the player method you
19:06 - could go ahead and separate this out
19:08 - into a color manager method that has an
19:10 - array of colors maybe an
19:13 - in enumerator or an enum instead with
19:16 - the different colors with nice with a
19:19 - singleton pattern and you can go ahead
19:21 - and call functions for setting and
19:23 - getting colors and all that fancy stuff
19:26 - but that also doubles development time
19:29 - and because this is a live stream we'll
19:31 - do it the quick fast and fun way and
19:33 - that means that we'll go in here and
19:36 - we'll create a public string and this is
19:39 - going to be our current color and we'll
19:42 - default this and we actually don't want
19:44 - to default this will also make a void
19:46 - start and right when we start the game
19:49 - we want to get a random color and we
19:51 - want to do this multiple times during
19:53 - the game so let's just make a method for
19:56 - that let's call it something like set
19:58 - random color and let's go down here in
20:02 - order to create it that students at the
20:05 - bottom so void set random color and
20:10 - because we know all of the different
20:13 - colors that is going to be in the game
20:15 - which is only four and we know that
20:17 - we're never going to change this and so
20:19 - I'll write to hard-code the same so
20:21 - we'll go Ginn's index in order to get a
20:25 - random value between zero and three
20:27 - meaning zero one two three four
20:30 - different numbers equals random range so
20:34 - this is going to give us that printim
20:36 - number between zero and three and we can
20:39 - then go ahead depending on what number
20:41 - we got switch to a certain color so
20:44 - we'll make a switch statement here and
20:47 - the value that we want to have different
20:51 - cases for is the index and will open and
20:54 - close some curly brackets and then we
20:56 - can write out our different cases now I
20:59 - found out recently that a lot of people
21:01 - actually aren't familiar with using
21:04 - switch statements a lot of beginners
21:05 - only know the basic if statements and
21:08 - maybe a four or for each loop switch
21:11 - statements is something that you don't
21:13 - use as often but they can just be really
21:15 - handy syntax wise they basically allow
21:18 - you to more easily create a series of
21:21 - statements we could go into and say if
21:24 - indexed this
21:26 - equal to zero there's one thing is I do
21:31 - one thing and then else if index is
21:39 - equal to one and then do something else
21:43 - and then keep on going for all of the
21:46 - different are cases but that is pretty
21:48 - syntax heavy and it's also um it doesn't
21:52 - allow you to do or it doesn't as easily
21:55 - allow you to do stuff like default cases
21:57 - um breaking and or falling to other
22:00 - cases I'll show you guys this in a
22:03 - second so here we basically do the same
22:05 - thing we say that we want to have a look
22:08 - at our index value and depending on what
22:10 - it is we want to do different stuff in
22:12 - the case that it is zero we want to do
22:16 - this line right here and what we want to
22:19 - do here is maybe said our current color
22:22 - equal to I will just use the first one
22:26 - which is sign and we then break which
22:29 - means that we exit the switch statement
22:32 - then in case one we want to set current
22:37 - color equal to yellow and we then break
22:40 - as well in case of two we said current
22:46 - color equal two and then we go on
22:50 - magenta and we break us once and in case
22:55 - three we set current color equal to
22:59 - armed and we'll go pink cool so we very
23:05 - easily go ahead and define different
23:07 - cases and if I'm not mistaken this is
23:09 - actually also lighter on the compiler so
23:12 - this will actually happen quicker but
23:14 - there might be some optimization behind
23:17 - the scenes where it recognizes these
23:19 - patterns and if statements and
23:20 - automatically convert them converts them
23:23 - into switch statement I don't know
23:25 - exactly how that works so I'm not going
23:27 - to put my word on it but um your switch
23:31 - statements they are awesome so we have
23:34 - all these different cases and now we
23:36 - should see that when we start our game
23:38 - our current color
23:40 - get set to random color so let's hit
23:42 - play here or let's elect our player and
23:44 - it's hit play and we should see the
23:46 - current color here set to magenta if we
23:48 - try and do that again
23:49 - it's set to yellow whoops with a
23:52 - spelling error and yeah you can see the
23:55 - yellow again there we also have the
23:58 - Scion awesome so I just need to go in
24:00 - here and this is really the danger of
24:02 - doing it this way is that you are prone
24:04 - to spelling errors so make sure to spell
24:06 - things the exact correct way and thank
24:09 - you for pointing that out in the chat I
24:11 - might not have seen it um so yeah so now
24:15 - we set a random color however you will
24:18 - see that the color of our object doesn't
24:21 - actually change so in order to change
24:24 - that we need to access the sprite
24:26 - renderer and set the color property so
24:29 - how to do that we need of course a
24:31 - reference to our a sprite renderer
24:35 - sprite renderer and we'll call this one
24:38 - SR and we also need four different
24:42 - colors we could just go in here and use
24:44 - the default ones color dots I and called
24:47 - magenta actually if it has all of them
24:49 - doesn't have pink all right we'll have
24:52 - to do it then so we can go in here and
24:54 - define our own one we're going to create
24:56 - a public color and this is going to be
24:58 - our color cyan we'll create a public
25:02 - color color um
25:05 - yellow that's a lot of extra typing for
25:10 - this one color magenta and public color
25:14 - color and then pink cool so down here we
25:20 - can then set s our color equal to color
25:24 - cyan or and down here we can do yellow
25:29 - down here we can do magenta and here we
25:31 - can do pink so color yellow color
25:37 - Jesus color magenta and color pink ha I
25:44 - think we made it guys I almost passed
25:47 - out at the pink one
25:49 - too many colors Jesus imagine if we had
25:53 - five or six all right so um why don't
25:58 - you use a color array and use the int as
26:00 - index you could do that just as well and
26:02 - it wouldn't make a difference
26:05 - I'm just hard coding things in here
26:06 - because I don't want to do extra work
26:09 - but you could just as well use anyway if
26:12 - you want so whatever you want to do so
26:17 - that should not work and if we exit out
26:20 - of on Visual Studio we can see now that
26:23 - we have a sprite renderer slot where
26:25 - we'll drag this one in we'll have all
26:28 - these different colors so we can go
26:29 - ahead and color pick the sign here and
26:32 - make sure that you pump up the alpha as
26:34 - well or else it's going to be invisible
26:36 - so make sure to full max out the
26:39 - alphabet on all of these as well so
26:42 - we'll set the whoops that's not the pink
26:45 - one there we go and for the pink here as
26:49 - well cool now when we add play yes we
26:55 - turn into a random color that's awesome
26:58 - we don't actually have this comparing of
27:01 - the tanks yet but that is really really
27:04 - easy to create on top so we had yellow
27:06 - twice in a row there and now we have
27:08 - sine cold so now all we need to do is go
27:11 - into the script here and use and use on
27:18 - trigger Institute II here to check if
27:20 - collider tag is equal to our current
27:24 - color and if it is we pass without
27:31 - anything happening however if it is not
27:36 - we messed up and bad things will happen
27:42 - so we're going here and throw a game
27:44 - over
27:47 - there we go so now if we play and jump
27:52 - up here so now we are signed let's see
27:55 - what happens if we make the jump
27:57 - everything is good but as you see
27:59 - whenever I touch any of the other colors
28:02 - it complaints cold and this is why you
28:07 - would go in and put some kind of death
28:09 - effects some kind of shattering into a
28:11 - thousand pieces and colored some kind of
28:13 - screen shake on the camera and then a
28:16 - way to restart the level we won't be
28:19 - bothering too much with that we can
28:20 - maybe go ahead and restart the level in
28:22 - just a second but first I wanted to show
28:25 - you how you can expand upon this so on
28:27 - the next thing that you probably want to
28:29 - make is a way for us to change color so
28:31 - let's go in here and create another on
28:34 - 2d objects sprite and we'll make this
28:36 - into a knob and we can make this two by
28:40 - two as well reset the transform actually
28:43 - and then make it two by two and we can
28:45 - drag this up on the screen here and we
28:50 - can make this on change our color
28:52 - actually of course if it's outside our
28:55 - screen we need to also have our camera
28:59 - follow the players so I actually just
29:02 - changed my mind let's leave this color
29:05 - changer here for just a moment while we
29:09 - make our camera follow the player so in
29:11 - the original game basically what we have
29:13 - is a situation where the player gets to
29:16 - jump freely but as soon as the player
29:18 - passes the midpoint our camera is going
29:21 - to follow him up so we basically have a
29:24 - still camera that makes sure to always
29:26 - stay at the same if not a greater
29:29 - y-value than the player and so if we add
29:33 - a component here called something like
29:35 - follow player or follow target and we
29:39 - double click that and in here we again
29:42 - get rid of the system namespaces we
29:45 - create a public transform which is the
29:49 - reference to a playroom we can call it
29:51 - either player or target I'm just going
29:53 - to go with player and inside of our
29:55 - update method here we simply check if
29:57 - player dot position dot y is
30:01 - greater than or equal point it's greater
30:03 - than transform.position dot why so if
30:07 - our player has passed our current
30:09 - position we're going to set transform
30:11 - position equal to a new vector3 where on
30:16 - the x we have zero on the Y we have
30:18 - players position dot Y and on the Z we
30:22 - have negative ten or whatever your
30:24 - camera has you can also go in here and
30:27 - input transform that position dot X and
30:30 - transform that position dot ly it's not
30:34 - really going to matter too much in our
30:36 - case but this is a bit more stable it
30:38 - allows you to change things in here
30:40 - without stuff breaking so um yeah let's
30:44 - see here so people are saying random dud
30:47 - ranges between 0 & 4 I do not believe so
30:54 - let's see here's the people spamming
30:56 - that's quite a bit in the chat so I
30:58 - think for integers they are both
30:59 - inclusive so let's see here random that
31:01 - range zero and see here returns a random
31:08 - integer between minimum inclusive and
31:10 - maximum exclusive all right guys I'm
31:13 - sorry I messed it up you're right it
31:16 - should be between 0 & 4 good call Jesus
31:20 - I almost messed that up that makes sense
31:25 - because it's it basically the inclusive
31:27 - exclusive stuff it's made this way so
31:30 - that you can just use it with the length
31:33 - of an array without having to worry
31:34 - about it and the length of an array is
31:37 - always 1 greater than the index of the
31:40 - last element so that's why it's made
31:42 - this way but thank you for the save guys
31:45 - the spam can can stop you guys won good
31:50 - job cool so um yeah so now we have a
31:54 - reference to our player or we have a
31:57 - slot where we can reference our player
31:59 - and we can just drag him in and we
32:01 - should now see if we're playing that in
32:04 - the beginning here nothing happens and
32:06 - then as we continue upwards our camera
32:09 - is going to follow our position and it's
32:12 - not going to follow it down because I
32:15 - players that's falling down well then
32:16 - he's messed up but it's only one way to
32:19 - go here and that's up cool
32:22 - so um then what we want to do is of
32:26 - course have a look at the color changer
32:28 - here so I'm just going to go make this
32:30 - um black where these darker and I think
32:35 - in the original game it was a
32:37 - multicolored like on the circle here so
32:40 - you can go ahead and make a fancy sprite
32:41 - for that but for now I'm just going to
32:43 - do the dark one here and we actually
32:46 - don't need to add a custom component to
32:48 - this what we're going to do instead is
32:50 - simply do the triggering here again
32:53 - inside of the player I mean that's a bit
32:56 - easier at least so instead let's go up
32:59 - here and add a new tag to this and it's
33:01 - called this one on something like color
33:03 - changer and also on the color change
33:06 - your object we'll go ahead and add a
33:08 - circle Collider 2d and we'll snap this
33:11 - in Vice just a tiny bit so point zero
33:15 - nine cool so I believe that's pretty
33:18 - much all we needed to do for the color
33:20 - changer itself let's actually go ahead
33:22 - and turn this into a prefab and we could
33:26 - do the same with the small circle but I
33:27 - don't think that ok that's do it let's
33:31 - turn that into a previous one so now our
33:34 - color changes here which then we go into
33:37 - visual studio we check if code that tag
33:42 - is equal to color changer and if it is
33:47 - we're going to go ahead and set a new
33:48 - color so we're going to say set random
33:51 - color and then we're going to return so
33:54 - that we are not going to get a game
33:57 - overstatement cool so if we now hit play
34:02 - or whoops we also need to set the tag
34:04 - for the color changer man some of these
34:06 - things today it's it's bad so let's
34:08 - apply and let's hit play and let's see
34:14 - if this is working so we make it through
34:16 - here and we make it through there and
34:19 - indeed we change colors every time look
34:21 - at all the color changing it's awesome
34:24 - of course we also need to consume this
34:27 - um
34:28 - a changer here whenever we do this so
34:30 - let's go into Visual Studio let's say
34:34 - let's find a place here and we basically
34:38 - just want to destroy called dot game
34:42 - object there we go again if you're going
34:45 - to make this more serious game that
34:48 - you're going to work more on separate
34:49 - some of this code out from the player
34:51 - script it's not good to have all of this
34:53 - in one place it's just not good and
34:58 - maintain containable
34:59 - code this way but it should work so now
35:02 - we can jump in here and we can continue
35:05 - up and it consumes it and we change
35:07 - color so that is awesome
35:10 - of course I advise you to go in here
35:13 - also under your set random color and add
35:15 - some kind of a check to see if the color
35:18 - you've chosen is the one that you
35:20 - already have and if it is pick a new one
35:23 - so that's something that you can
35:25 - experiment here you don't want to change
35:28 - to another color that you already have
35:30 - this becomes a tiny bit easier actually
35:32 - if you're using the method where you add
35:34 - an array because it allows you to kind
35:37 - of simply X or remove an element from
35:42 - that array which is your current color
35:44 - and then picks a random one in the new
35:46 - array and then put everything back in
35:49 - but I think this method is simply too
35:52 - easy to to pass up cool so that's pretty
35:58 - much all of the logic that I wanted to
36:00 - show you guys how to do today I mean
36:02 - from here it's just a matter of creating
36:04 - some more levels you can duplicate the
36:07 - color circle and move it up here we can
36:10 - make another version of the color
36:13 - changer here we can go ahead and make
36:17 - another version of the circle and this
36:19 - time we'll go ahead and duplicate it and
36:21 - instead of just slicing it up here I do
36:23 - definitely recommend creating a nother
36:26 - sprite which is larger but has the same
36:29 - width because this way you are going to
36:31 - get varying width and then for each
36:34 - circle here we can vary up their speed
36:36 - so we can do a negative 40 on this one
36:39 - make it pretty
36:40 - so actually let's do the opposite let's
36:42 - make it super fast let's do negative one
36:44 - sixty and forth on this one we can go
36:48 - one hundred and then for this one we can
36:50 - go one hundred and 150 here so if we now
36:54 - hit play we should see on that we can
36:56 - actually play this pretty much the same
36:59 - way as the online game man I suck it's a
37:03 - good thing we haven't implemented scene
37:05 - reloading yet so yeah wait for these two
37:09 - to sting up and then go through
37:11 - wow I'm bad so um yeah so the final
37:14 - thing is just reloading the scene and in
37:16 - order to do that we simply go in here we
37:18 - use the whoops you singing unity engine
37:23 - that scene management and down arm here
37:29 - we say if Collider the tyre is not equal
37:32 - to current color we throw a game over
37:35 - statement and we say scene manager dot
37:38 - load scene and the scene that we want to
37:40 - load is two currently loaded scene so we
37:42 - get Seemandhra get active scene dot
37:44 - build index because we need to feed it
37:46 - the index at the scene and we then say
37:49 - that and boom we should have reloading
37:51 - when we mess up so let's see yes cool so
37:56 - that's all I wanted to show you guys
37:57 - today I hope you kind of like a little
38:00 - mini game here which I really really
38:03 - really need to improve on let's see if I
38:06 - can have like one go through if I
38:09 - concentrate don't talk too much
38:10 - oh Jesus
38:14 - oh this is the hard part now I didn't
38:19 - make I'm sorry
38:20 - alright so bad you're supposed to be
38:23 - good at the games that you make oh cool
38:26 - guys so I hope that you learned
38:28 - something from this example and now
38:30 - we'll go ahead and transition over to a
38:33 - Q&A style themed thing where you can ask
38:38 - all the questions that you want and
38:40 - we're also going to have a look at um
38:42 - the bottom tower game so maybe also play
38:46 - some others other guys a Ludum dare
38:49 - games that could be pretty fun
38:50 - but will definitely switch over to a
38:53 - more real
38:53 - next format now and yes that is the
38:56 - tutorial in so yeah remember that both
39:02 - this video will be of am YouTube and the
39:04 - entire project with scripts with the
39:08 - sprites that I used here and all the
39:10 - project files will be up on github so
39:13 - don't worry about that and also if you
39:16 - don't want to wait until this airs on
39:18 - YouTube you can go ahead and watch it
39:21 - immediately after on Twitch but that
39:24 - times out after a couple of you of weeks
39:27 - so let's go and switch to Q&A here is so
39:31 - there we go so ask away with your
39:33 - questions and I'll do my best to answer
39:37 - them as usual so let's see here um Q&A
39:44 - time yes so are you working on some game
39:49 - yourself or do make tutorial video
39:51 - streams exclusively I'm not working on a
39:54 - larger game project right now it's not
39:57 - something that I feel I have the time to
39:59 - do on top of everything else that I'm
40:01 - doing as you say with um with the videos
40:04 - and livestreams and dev assets but I
40:08 - love to do smaller hobby projects on
40:10 - participating in doodleberries it's just
40:13 - so much fun fun to do so it's not not
40:17 - because I don't want to it's more time
40:19 - thing the video will air on YouTube on
40:22 - this evening so later today I am how old
40:28 - am I
40:29 - haha twenty years old that is my age um
40:34 - [Music]
40:35 - seriously I wasn't out there for a
40:37 - second um can you make a video about
40:42 - writing basic shaders I think I covered
40:44 - doing something on shaded programming
40:46 - could be really fun at some point it's
40:49 - not something that I am too good at I
40:52 - mean I know how to write basic shaders
40:53 - and I know how to get some stuff of a
40:55 - running but for example for this first
40:56 - shader that I use for this is autumn
40:58 - dire I actually used another tutorial on
41:01 - to do that because it's not something
41:02 - that I immediately just knew how to do a
41:04 - really great one by N's
41:07 - nissim you can check that out he does a
41:09 - lot of graphics programming stuff that
41:11 - you can check out um let's see when I'm
41:16 - going to make a video about AI Oh soon
41:18 - it is coming I've actually been talking
41:21 - to some guys that we add unity and we're
41:25 - talking about ways that we can kind of
41:26 - collaborate on on video stuff with the
41:29 - unity learn team and I know both for
41:32 - them and for me like AI and knavish and
41:36 - the new national system is pretty much
41:39 - on the top of the list so you can you
41:40 - can definitely count on something being
41:42 - made there and someone has birthday
41:47 - congratulations it's awesome
41:49 - um let's see can you please make a
41:55 - tutorial about making a car that
41:57 - actually works
41:58 - something with car physics could be
41:59 - super fun now definitely I would I would
42:03 - love to do that at some point will you
42:08 - be doing a new tutorial series soon I
42:10 - don't have any plans for a particular
42:12 - series right now I've been enjoying
42:14 - doing standalone stuff quite a bit I
42:18 - just did three videos on kind of shooter
42:21 - related subjects which was all kind of
42:24 - for weapon related stuff which was
42:27 - weapon switching shooting with Ray cast
42:30 - and an ammo and reload system so that
42:33 - was kind of mini serious like but I
42:36 - don't want to go ahead and venture on
42:37 - out into any any large series me know
42:40 - what got you into YouTube
42:43 - that's a good question I actually
42:45 - started on YouTube with making um well
42:52 - in the very beginning it was montages of
42:55 - video games I really overrated montage
43:00 - stuff added a lot of fun with that um I
43:03 - started in Sony Vegas just mixing things
43:07 - together moved on to premiere moved on
43:09 - to After Effects and yeah when I went
43:12 - crazy from that stuff like I did some
43:15 - counter-strike montages some Call of
43:17 - Duty montages I also did Tudor
43:20 - was way back in the day on After Effects
43:23 - before really knew how to to do anything
43:28 - so I hope you guys won't find them ever
43:30 - I need to private them I think they are
43:34 - really embarrassing that's kind of how I
43:37 - got started with YouTube always been
43:38 - interested in the chin the nerdy
43:40 - tutorial stuff what's my favorite game
43:44 - hard question it's been asked before
43:46 - these these dreams I I actually don't
43:49 - know the answer I'm sorry I maybe it was
43:51 - the for craft um let's see um may I ask
44:01 - if you're needy was the first game
44:03 - program you made as a new user here if
44:05 - so where can I hear about you I'm not
44:10 - sure I understand the question sorry um
44:16 - let's see have you tried VR it depends
44:20 - on if you mean developing for VR or
44:23 - tried out some VR equipment I've
44:26 - definitely tried playing some VR games
44:28 - got my hands on the oculus development
44:32 - kit when that was really new I've also
44:34 - tried the HTC vive as some of that
44:36 - different stuff I've tried a bunch of on
44:39 - VR solutions now actually and it's it's
44:42 - really fun it's never really been much
44:45 - of an interest for me per se I feel like
44:48 - some of some people are really really
44:50 - into VR stuff um but I don't know it
44:54 - just it's fun for me but I think it's
44:58 - not something I would personally use on
45:00 - a day-to-day basis and it's not
45:02 - something that I have a huge interest in
45:04 - developing for let's see do you have a
45:09 - lot of experience in unreal if yes how
45:11 - do you feel when switching from unity
45:13 - and vice-versa I don't have a lot of
45:15 - experience in unreal I know my way
45:17 - around unreal
45:19 - sort of and I've used it for some things
45:22 - but I would never ever say that I have a
45:26 - lot of experience in unreal unreal II
45:27 - something that you have to develop for
45:29 - on a day to day basis in order to be
45:32 - I feel I'd say it's a huge Peters piece
45:35 - of software and it's constantly changing
45:37 - and yeah yeah I'm familiar with unreal
45:42 - that's it what age did you start
45:45 - creating games um don't know I think I
45:50 - started creating games when I rust
45:53 - around ten but when I say that you must
45:57 - take it with a grain of salt it was the
45:59 - simplest and simplest of software it was
46:03 - an old version of game maybe not the
46:06 - current game maker that we know now but
46:07 - a very very bad old piece of software
46:12 - from another company which was oh it was
46:15 - so bad I started making games in that
46:18 - moved on to the blender engine which I
46:21 - where I did a bit of being visual nerd
46:23 - scripting and then discovered unity and
46:25 - was just amazed about how much you could
46:29 - do and just how much cleaner of a tool
46:32 - it was and everything I'd been using so
46:34 - far so I think around 10 but it didn't
46:36 - really catch on until I was 14 or 15 or
46:40 - something like that um let's see I will
46:45 - object pooling mega huge difference in
46:47 - performance in this case what we're not
46:48 - instantiated anything so you wouldn't
46:51 - need to apply all the object cooling if
46:53 - you mean like enabling and disabling
46:55 - objects as we go it totally depends on
46:57 - how long your level is if you want to do
47:00 - a procedurally generated world here I
47:03 - would definitely recommend it especially
47:04 - because this is a kind of meant for
47:07 - mobile or with game so that would make a
47:10 - lot of sense
47:12 - what is the first game engine I used
47:14 - well that was the game maker if you can
47:16 - even call that thing an engine bad guy
47:19 - oh if any of you guys have ever used the
47:22 - old old game maker and know what I'm
47:24 - talking about I don't even know they
47:26 - don't even remember the name of the
47:28 - company anymore but yeah let me know how
47:33 - did I learn coding from tutorials have
47:35 - like two books and practice do you think
47:41 - it's worth it to learn c-sharp at school
47:43 - or learn it yourself well it really
47:45 - depends on how you like to
47:47 - learn if you are very much a social
47:49 - Persian person and need to be in kind of
47:51 - the social environment with others in
47:53 - order to learn something when then
47:55 - school can be great for you or if you
47:57 - feel like you don't have the discipline
47:59 - to sit down and learn a skill for
48:01 - yourself then school can also be a good
48:03 - way to do that you put into an
48:05 - institution and your deadlines you have
48:07 - things that you must do and you have a
48:08 - time where you need to get there and so
48:11 - um that can really help drive you along
48:14 - personally I don't do well under that
48:16 - kind of environment I'm much better at
48:18 - just putting tasks laying out tasks for
48:21 - myself and then completing them at my
48:22 - own pace and because I want to also
48:25 - because when you are self taught you can
48:26 - go ahead and not maybe focus so much on
48:29 - the having to learn all sort of stuff
48:31 - and then instead focus on the fun
48:33 - projects that you can do and and what
48:35 - something inspiring that you want to
48:36 - make and that that can really help drive
48:38 - on inspiration and fun in learning stuff
48:42 - like this that at least for me that is
48:44 - the main thing is just finding something
48:46 - that you want to make and then learning
48:48 - the tools required to make that that's
48:50 - always been the way that I've worked if
48:52 - I just sit down and say today I'm going
48:54 - to learn C++ I might write some C++ I
48:58 - might get a better understanding of C++
49:01 - it but it's never the way that I get
49:03 - proficient with it
49:05 - that only happens if I have a project
49:07 - where C++ is required how long did it
49:12 - take you to grow your hair well it
49:13 - depends on the length I mean this long
49:16 - here it's really getting wrong now that
49:20 - has taken a taken a long time like a
49:22 - year or something but we're almost
49:26 - having cutted like trim day only but I
49:31 - mean it it took me three four months to
49:35 - grow long hair why don't you give
49:39 - object-oriented design tutorials well I
49:45 - do a lot of tutorials on object-oriented
49:48 - programming languages but nothing on
49:50 - like object-oriented design patterns so
49:54 - I don't know why haven't had that many
49:58 - requests for it
49:59 - that's why can you teach us how to make
50:04 - our game audible laudable functionality
50:08 - really depends on the game and it's
50:10 - something that you write particularly
50:12 - for every single game if you mean
50:14 - creating some kind of multiple script or
50:17 - some kind of mod scripting language like
50:20 - Lua there's plenty of tutorials on that
50:24 - actually cool eighteen is probably the
50:26 - person to check out he's done a lot of
50:27 - stuff with modding games so you can
50:29 - check out his tutorials but I don't have
50:32 - anything on the roadmap right now um
50:36 - let's see why don't you shake I do shave
50:42 - please be nice I shave regularly maybe
50:46 - not today but like few days ago um let's
50:50 - see are you a programmer or is it or is
50:55 - it a passion both um which programs did
51:00 - you use for little diary I think guys I
51:02 - think it's time to have a look at the
51:04 - little diary don't you want to do that I
51:06 - think I think I want to do that let's
51:08 - let's do it let's have a look at some
51:09 - dumb diary stuff so let me transition
51:12 - over here to my main scene there we go
51:14 - whoops look there are hundreds of me
51:18 - dancing actually there's as many of me
51:21 - dancing as there are pixels on the
51:23 - screen okay so let's uh find it here
51:30 - I'll just take away dancing me and let's
51:36 - go to the LG Chem website so I'm just
51:40 - going to log in here and I'm going to do
51:41 - that on the server monitor here and
51:44 - let's have a look at first of all of
51:46 - course my submission but also some of
51:48 - the ugly stuff on here so um cat first
51:51 - do you guys want to see the cat that
51:53 - receive this anything nearby look like
51:58 - the hero now I'm sorry I will make sure
51:59 - to pick them up if they if they come so
52:05 - yeah this is my submission
52:08 - it's called shrinking planet and die
52:11 - it's about
52:12 - little red car that drives around the
52:14 - road he likes driving and suddenly the
52:18 - planet gets um rained down upon by
52:24 - meteors and it's about surviving as long
52:26 - as you can there are links here for
52:28 - windows/mac and the source I'm just
52:30 - going to link this in the chat there you
52:33 - go if you want to go ahead and play it
52:35 - and here are the tools here so I have a
52:39 - bit of information here you can check
52:40 - out the the making off video it's right
52:43 - here
52:43 - I used unity five point six everything
52:46 - is written in C sharp
52:47 - I used Visual Studio as the code editor
52:49 - use Photoshop to do all the graphics
52:54 - stuff oops I forgot one I also use
52:57 - blender I'm gonna put that in here right
52:59 - now
53:00 - I used blender for all of them on there
53:04 - the modeling I used adobe audition for
53:07 - these sound and Busker sorry but you can
53:09 - see all something this this soft right
53:12 - here for the audio so a lot of fun and
53:15 - I'm just going to go ahead and play this
53:17 - now so let me bring it up I don't even
53:20 - know if I have it installed on my own
53:24 - system if I even created an installer
53:27 - let's go and find it on a project and
53:30 - then load them dari 38 and here we are
53:34 - build windows and here we go
53:38 - through the game boom and we should see
53:44 - that it jumps directly in here cool let
53:47 - me just actually turn on whoops oh no
53:50 - there you go mute myself and let's see
53:58 - everything is going crazy at once panic
54:03 - there we go okay and let me turn on test
54:06 - of audio here let me know how how loud
54:10 - this stuff is and if I need to balance
54:12 - anything up okay so here's the music and
54:15 - here's the game and I actually really
54:19 - like the menu screen that I decided to
54:21 - do here I like the fact that you can
54:22 - actually control the car during the menu
54:25 - screen here
54:26 - you can drive around you will just be
54:28 - able to drive through meteors because I
54:29 - didn't want the play to die going the
54:31 - menu but we have some controls you can
54:33 - quit and you can play and am I going
54:37 - through that include just to make sure
54:39 - I'm just going to bump down the music
54:40 - even more here cool then we can hit play
54:44 - and it's going to do the school zoom out
54:45 - and cementing and we are in the game and
54:48 - this is what it looks like I ended up
54:51 - doing this UI that followed kind of the
54:54 - shrinking planet which I really liked I
54:57 - spend a lot of time on kind of the
54:59 - graphics polishing for this game and wow
55:02 - that was that was bad
55:04 - let's try that again I did a lot of fun
55:09 - I work on the graphics polishing if you
55:12 - have a look at the smoke particles here
55:14 - you can see that I'm using the new noise
55:16 - filter for the particles which makes
55:18 - them look so much cooler and the cool
55:22 - thing is that as the planet shrinks so
55:25 - does the meteors here and they will
55:27 - actually disappear after a little while
55:28 - so you won't get too cluttered but it's
55:31 - still fairly highs and fairly hard and
55:34 - you have to have good reactions in order
55:37 - to do this so yeah it's the game let me
55:41 - see how far you can get here and then
55:43 - we'll boot up the unity project sorry I
55:47 - cannot talk while I'm focusing this no
55:50 - assets of that my personal record is 27
55:55 - meters I know it doesn't look like that
55:58 - right now I think it's all was also the
56:01 - record actually that's not true my
56:04 - present I reckoned exactly is 27.5 and
56:07 - sophia's is 12 27.4 so please try and
56:13 - beat that so um yeah it's let's boot up
56:16 - the identity project here and i'ma show
56:18 - you around and I can see you requests on
56:21 - me trying out um
56:23 - Sebastian rigs game which yeah sure why
56:26 - not
56:27 - um so let me open up wait is it
56:35 - am I just totally missing it here oh
56:40 - it's probably because I moved it
56:43 - let me just reopen it and this is the
56:46 - low domed array 38 shrinking planet
56:50 - looks like that folder and have unity
56:53 - booted up we can have a look at it let's
57:03 - see here
57:04 - cool yeah and you guys got the link
57:07 - that's awesome
57:08 - this might take a little while because
57:10 - they are quite a few assets in here
57:13 - that's meanwhile while we're waiting we
57:15 - want to boot up let's check out Sofia's
57:17 - entry which I'm also going to link you
57:19 - and let's find this with a direct link
57:24 - called Meetup and she did a really cute
57:27 - I thought and kind of original twist
57:29 - interpretation of the theme it's about
57:32 - avoiding people you know on the UH on
57:35 - the street so you don't have to chat
57:37 - with them kind of another interpretation
57:40 - of a small world which I think was
57:42 - really nice so I'm just going to go
57:44 - ahead and throw you a link here and
57:49 - check that out I'm just going to boot up
57:51 - the web version here and show you guys
57:54 - what this looks like and see how well I
57:56 - can do let's see if everything is
57:59 - working here made with unity awesome so
58:04 - yeah she is called Betty our person of
58:07 - interest and these are the people that
58:10 - we need to remember so green red yellow
58:12 - black and blue all right in do that the
58:17 - music is really groovy here ah
58:24 - I'm counting myself at every single
58:28 - decision I don't is black like I think
58:31 - not her he's fine right yeah awesome and
58:35 - this one is definitely fine I love this
58:36 - sweater here see
58:42 - not that one
58:44 - he's fine as well that one is dangerous
58:46 - I think yes good
58:49 - yellow is dangerous as well right you
58:51 - guys can just screenshot it and see how
58:55 - bad this is yeah so with off I messed it
59:00 - up
59:01 - so really cute game I think stuff that
59:03 - could be added to this is a kind of a
59:06 - score modifier or score counter that
59:10 - shows how many friends or non friends
59:12 - that you've passed and maybe also
59:15 - something that could kind of expand upon
59:18 - the depth of the gameplay is have an
59:19 - array of people that you know and have
59:22 - that slowly get larger and larger so
59:24 - that the more you play the more people
59:26 - you know and so you both have to pay
59:28 - attention to that and remember new
59:30 - people as well as who is passing you by
59:32 - I think that could be a pretty fun thing
59:34 - and also of course when you're actually
59:36 - run into something have some kind of
59:37 - chat bubble up here um where where
59:41 - you're talking and you have to kind of
59:43 - sit through that that could also be be
59:45 - pretty fun so but really fun little game
59:48 - I think I'm pretty well done for for
59:50 - first time of course I am also biased so
59:55 - here is the UM the project for a
59:59 - shrinking planet and if we run and hit
60:02 - play here I can played in the editor and
60:05 - if I just pause this we can have a look
60:08 - around so basically the way that I did
60:10 - this was I created a planet which starts
60:14 - off at one one one and I the graphic
60:18 - here is just a sphere that I made in our
60:20 - blender it then has a Fox gravity
60:23 - attractor and I used a combination of
60:26 - different tutorials in order to get this
60:28 - right because I tried doing it on my own
60:31 - and I made it over complicated and this
60:33 - one is super simple it's something that
60:36 - I've done many times just implementing
60:38 - normally normal gravity attraction and
60:41 - then what I did was I wanted some
60:43 - objects to not only be attracted towards
60:46 - the center of the planet but just snap
60:48 - on top of the surface of that planet and
60:50 - there are used move position to just
60:53 - place
60:53 - them at the top of the planet by getting
60:58 - a vector that points from the center of
61:00 - our planet body dub position or
61:03 - transform the position and then subtract
61:05 - that from our body the position which is
61:09 - whatever we attracting here in order to
61:11 - get in a vector from the sender to a
61:13 - body normalize that and then multiply it
61:17 - with on the scale of our planet times
61:20 - the radius so just the radius of our
61:22 - planet so what this allows us to do is
61:25 - as our planet shrinks our car is always
61:29 - going to be snapped right at the top of
61:32 - that planet and that together with the
61:35 - script that shrinks the planet actually
61:37 - does all of the gravity calculations for
61:40 - us then all we have to do on the player
61:43 - object here is have a gravity body that
61:46 - places it on the surface together with
61:49 - the attractor and then a player
61:51 - controller and this is actually fairly
61:54 - simple recently move forward using RBW
61:58 - position and we don't have to worry
61:59 - about the fact that we are going in kind
62:02 - of a tangential line to where we want to
62:04 - be because that's going to be handled by
62:08 - the gravity attractor and then we simply
62:11 - apply some rotation to make sure that
62:13 - the bottom of our car always points
62:15 - toward the center and we also apply some
62:17 - rotation on top of that that is input
62:20 - driven and that's what I do here I get
62:23 - let's see here
62:25 - where is this that's here I get a delta
62:29 - rotation by converting our Y rotation
62:31 - into Euler hang or from Euler angles
62:34 - into a quaternion and I then apply that
62:37 - to our current with the body rotation
62:39 - and I then kind of smooth it out a
62:41 - little bit so yep ended up working it's
62:45 - maybe not the prettiest thing in the
62:47 - world but it ended up being fairly
62:48 - simple at least compared to what I did
62:51 - before and what I really liked about
62:54 - this one is probably just beyond the
62:56 - grasp and I ended up making I think it
62:58 - looks awesome and it's really really
63:00 - easy to adjust this wallet we go ahead
63:02 - and check the planet here and the grass
63:04 - shader
63:05 - and I want to switch to the default
63:07 - controls here actually let me just bring
63:10 - up the material two instead so we don't
63:12 - have this highlight you can see the
63:14 - awesome knobs here and this is all
63:16 - thanks to the tutorial that followed by
63:17 - Alan Taccone we can see how we can still
63:20 - have smoothness on the planet not that
63:22 - this is something that you particularly
63:23 - want actually could use a little bit and
63:26 - a metallic slider but much more
63:28 - important we have furlings
63:30 - you can go totally nuts with this we
63:32 - have the Alpha cutoff for our texture
63:34 - and the texture used here is just a
63:35 - symbol noise that we are generated and
63:38 - applied a few filters to you cut off at
63:42 - the end here we have the fading the
63:44 - amount of fade at the tips the gravity
63:48 - direction if you want to kind of shift
63:49 - that in a certain direction which is
63:53 - really really cool that you can do that
63:55 - as well on the gravity string and we
63:59 - also have stuff like the rim called oops
64:01 - this is something that I tried adding on
64:03 - top where is it um wind power where do
64:08 - they place this this is not yeah I ended
64:12 - up not using this I remember I tried to
64:14 - add kind of a rim fill but I didn't
64:17 - think it looked cool and so I removed it
64:19 - but for some reason I haven't removed
64:20 - key yeah I haven't removed the
64:22 - properties but it was in there at some
64:24 - point
64:25 - and also on the the particles for the
64:28 - meteors I think worked pretty well here
64:31 - you can bring up a media and have a look
64:34 - at it there we go and you can hear the
64:37 - sound here as well as we get closer this
64:40 - is just me saying Shh what I ended up
64:44 - working just fine actually let me play
64:46 - this and having a meteor that is
64:49 - actually flying towards the plane you
64:51 - can see I've messed up the shader here
64:52 - now but it's alright so here it is so I
64:57 - think this ended up being pretty cool I
65:00 - had a combination of trail rendering
65:03 - some particles and yeah just a bunch of
65:07 - particles actually on the light if I go
65:10 - ahead and play it a bit further here we
65:11 - can have a look at it once it gets
65:14 - closer to the planet let's take this one
65:16 - here
65:17 - you can see the actual light emitting on
65:20 - the arm planet we have this trail here
65:23 - if I go ahead and disable that you can
65:25 - see the effect of this so we have the
65:29 - sparks flying off it what's not
65:33 - simulating oh so annoying
65:35 - anyways on top of all the particle
65:38 - systems I have a trail render as well
65:39 - which just helps kind of define it a
65:41 - little bit and at the very tip I made
65:43 - sure to have kind of a clear if I select
65:47 - one of the other meteors I have kind of
65:49 - a clear um emissive texture that um I
65:55 - painted in Photoshop so that's this one
65:58 - under the particle system here the
66:00 - renderer the flare this is something I
66:03 - went into Photoshop and generated using
66:05 - just some noise filters and a bunch of
66:08 - glow and a bit of color and it really
66:11 - helped tie everything together at bat in
66:13 - the beginning I simply use the default
66:15 - particle and you can see that really
66:19 - doesn't look nearly as powerful but as
66:21 - soon as I went in and created this I
66:23 - really helped bring it to light and then
66:25 - of course the awesome part is the the
66:29 - smoke here has noise supplies applied to
66:33 - it which is what gives this random cool
66:35 - look also I have some skies in here
66:37 - around the planet that it are noticeable
66:41 - but just kind of a nice detail to help
66:43 - give more of a 3d feel to the game so
66:47 - yep pretty satisfied with the result of
66:51 - it I'm just going to undo a bunch of
66:53 - times here and and jump out of it and
66:56 - finally on do you guys have a game that
66:58 - I you wanted me to play I can check out
67:00 - the best and legs game for sure if you
67:04 - don't know him he's another job awesome
67:08 - unity tutorial maker check him out he
67:12 - made a game about ah a turtle which he
67:17 - also made a making-of video on I'm just
67:20 - going to get a link to it here
67:23 - find that real quick let me see the
67:27 - check see here yeah let me just get a
67:40 - show of hands how many of you guys
67:42 - participated in Ludum dare it right I
67:45 - did in the chat if you did that would be
67:48 - awesome to see here we go so I found
67:51 - this video and here is a link to the
67:54 - game there it is
67:58 - space turtle right so let's play it it's
68:04 - on edge that IO and hopefully ah know
68:08 - WebGL link wonder why all right I'll
68:11 - just go ahead and download it for
68:12 - windows here shouldn't take too long
68:15 - um let's see oh yeah awesome
68:21 - multiple people here oh thanks for the
68:23 - link to space turtle - I was too slow to
68:27 - see that it's an OGG M game here okay so
68:31 - let's try out space turtle here let's
68:34 - raise turtle extract all right here come
68:42 - on
68:43 - speech - there we go let's boot it up
68:49 - this is pretty cool I mean of course the
68:52 - levels here are procedurally generated
68:54 - and he did a lot of work on kind of
68:56 - smoothing out the planet and the ropes
69:00 - required a bit of math and I can
69:02 - understand from his video that he had a
69:04 - bunch of trouble getting things to work
69:06 - as he wanted them to but let's try it
69:09 - out it's pretty cool that he also added
69:11 - a networked high score you can check out
69:16 - his video if you want to learn more
69:17 - about that I actually didn't have time
69:19 - to do any kind of high score system I
69:21 - was too focused on graphics so hats off
69:24 - to you sir it's nice it's really good to
69:27 - have in these kind of small competitive
69:30 - games just some idea of how did I do
69:32 - it's really nice I think my game is
69:35 - is very much lacking in that department
69:37 - but yeah you can see the ropes here they
69:41 - are definitely working and it kind of
69:43 - adjusts itself to the position of of the
69:46 - arterial slowly whoops that was violent
69:49 - ha ha ha that was way too vile it Porto
69:54 - I and the planned explodes just using a
69:58 - bunch of rigid bodies it's it's
70:01 - definitely nice he also does a lot of
70:04 - other game development tutorials stuff
70:06 - you can check out some of his other
70:10 - making of videos or I think he calls
70:12 - them behind the scenes
70:13 - okay I'm too bad at this he did some
70:16 - some jams as well which were very
70:19 - published um so let's see ah who
70:26 - participated a lot of you guys did
70:28 - that's awesome if you guys have some
70:30 - links I can try some of it out here I've
70:33 - got one here this is from your sink la
70:37 - nine nine one oh this is beautiful
70:39 - oh I really like the graphics here it's
70:42 - awesome um and know what Yelp why why
70:51 - you guys no matter what deal um I mean I
70:55 - can I should really be mistaken this
70:58 - this is not made with unity but alright
71:02 - anyways I'm going to download it looks
71:04 - fun if it want to download uh yes okay
71:13 - so it's downloading twice now alright we
71:15 - only need to download once room number
71:19 - data Andrew normative exe I'm just going
71:21 - to put it up here transferring and I
71:31 - need to bring up the chat again so just
71:33 - disappeared
71:36 - cool run I'm excited now
71:41 - um I'm probably just gonna play this in
71:44 - there in window just so I can see
71:46 - everything else while it's running
71:47 - oh nice room number start oh also the
72:00 - music loving it start I have no idea how
72:07 - to play this
72:08 - welcome to the room number he had some
72:10 - rules to play this game may be you don't
72:13 - like it but I know you will have a great
72:15 - mind you can only move in one axis to
72:18 - move along all the tails and stand in
72:19 - front of the gate to open it you cannot
72:21 - move through one child twice you can see
72:24 - a cube in this level maybe is an
72:27 - obstacle or friend okay I didn't get a
72:29 - chance to read that I have no idea what
72:32 - I'm doing I'm just going to okay to cube
72:38 - don't know what I'm doing
72:40 - probably just trying to get over here
72:42 - right yes no oh I messed up okay we
72:55 - start yes yes
73:01 - I don't get this Oh everything needs to
73:09 - be read right okay yeah I got that
73:11 - but how how do I get past this guy this
73:19 - is this is too difficult for me
73:22 - am I being dumb or do you guys get this
73:24 - I'm sorry
73:25 - the setting is too awesome here I'm
73:27 - loving the click mechanics and I'd
73:29 - really like to highlight here click on
73:31 - the player okay I have to read this ah
73:35 - take the character I'm sorry ah there we
73:42 - go
73:42 - oh this is awesome loving the sounds and
73:47 - and this shifting colors in these make
73:50 - it really nice old portals yes so this
73:59 - takes me over there I would imagine and
74:01 - do I need to click on them to use them
74:05 - I'm still confused I'm just going to
74:12 - move in this direction okay and then if
74:18 - I move down here and then here and then
74:20 - over here let it correct I'll do that
74:24 - but I have to move here is that Alright
74:27 - and then there and over there
74:29 - yes no no ha ha I talk too much really
74:40 - well done game I think probably because
74:43 - I'm skewing right now way too difficult
74:47 - for me way too quickly I suck but I
74:51 - really liked the feel of the game the
74:54 - graphics are nice and once I get that
74:56 - you could click on the character it's
74:58 - also pretty self-explanatory what you're
75:00 - able to do so awesome love it
75:02 - do you have more things from you guys
75:06 - here's one by on no kill this
75:11 - nope nope nope Noah Noah Kellis I'm
75:15 - gonna try it out here we go hey this is
75:19 - not um dari
75:21 - where is gluten where's the dari 14 days
75:30 - ago this is not good embarrassed to try
75:35 - what my team made yes bring it on
75:43 - okay play the game to do to do this
75:46 - looks really cold game link yes please
75:49 - and download for Windows yes
75:56 - it's downloading awesome let's see what
76:02 - other games do we have lined up yeah
76:06 - awesome so let me just drag this over
76:08 - here and we can pull it up
76:10 - I keep shrinking the chat for some
76:13 - reason there we go need to make sure
76:18 - that I don't miss something
76:19 - ah and here cool tabletop arena run and
76:30 - again probably want to run this in
76:32 - window what do you think about window
76:38 - frame the window uploading directed if
76:39 - I'm so cool hey oh what's up I'll so to
76:44 - teach you how to play the game oh it's
76:47 - about to move yeah left click to stab oh
76:49 - yes it's a dummy oh this is I'm already
76:55 - having fun with this okay you're
76:59 - probably supposed to save it I guess
77:00 - we're also - by pressing shift okay
77:04 - that's really rewarding yes Congrats
77:08 - hahaha I love this SMS yep okay can i
77:16 - buy
77:18 - okay that's it awesome let's do this
77:23 - play the game okay so it's kind of an
77:27 - arena survival game classic top-down the
77:30 - dashing axe actually also damage enemy
77:33 - so it's it's only stabbing ouch okay it
77:36 - doesn't look like it oh this is awesome
77:41 - loving the techno music as well this guy
77:44 - probably whoa it's magic
77:48 - ouch this is just me embarrassing myself
77:53 - oh my god Jesus oh come on why I I can't
78:03 - hit the guy it's not it's not possible

78:49 - it's ah ah - horrible oh so much okay
79:00 - we're going to rev it up you guys that I
79:03 - had a lot of fun today often playing
79:05 - some of you guys games we can maybe play
79:07 - some more on next livestream I know it's
79:09 - going to be a whoops holy I know it's
79:13 - going to be a while then since Ludum
79:15 - dare a but I mean then we can also talk
79:17 - about kind of how we did can and have a
79:20 - little post-mortem chat that could be
79:22 - really fun so that's it for this
79:24 - livestream I'm sorry when totally off
79:26 - track and we did crazy stuff but I had a
79:30 - lot of fun I hope you did as well and
79:32 - of course I will see you soon with
79:35 - another video the video that comes out
79:38 - this Sunday is actually super awesome

79:42 - post-processing stack all the different
79:44 - image effects and also it the first
79:46 - sponsored video to come out on the
79:48 - breakage channel so I just wanted to let
79:50 - you guys know that that's the thing now
79:51 - I work together with skills here to
79:55 - create a sponsored video and that just

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to this video this is a live stream tutorial on creating a replica of color switch which is a really fun minigame that you can see our works here so if I hit play here you can see that we have this bowl that we can control by pressing the spacebar in order to drum it's very much like flappy bird in this regard and we can jump up here we can only pass through the color that we currently have our ball and you can see a ball can change color along the way so I need to get up here and kind of time it correctly and you can also see that we have a little bug here where we can actually change to the same color that we're already on but we can have a look at changing that and it's it's really a game that you should expand upon in order to make more fun out of but I just want to show you how you can create these basic mechanics in the color changing and hit registration and you can really easily expand upon it to create more levels more shapes maybe even more colors and definitely some powerups some scores and some cool death particle effects that's that's not a stuff to do here but today we'll just get out the core game so let's just go ahead and get started with this so let's go file new project and we want to of course create a 2d project and let's call this one color switch replica there we go and unity is just going to boot up all of the necessary files in the background here and meanwhile I'm going to have a look in the chat to see how everyone is doing is it infinite no it's not infinite I've done it you could very easily go ahead and make this procedurally generated simply instantiate in circles using some kind of random prefabs selected from an array or I could go the route that I'm doing here which is just allowing you to create your own levels but you can do anything like that it's it's really easy to add procedural generation to this so um and hi to everyone who is joining a lot of people tuning in that's awesome so on let's begin by kind of changing our background here to a darkish gray something like that not too inspiring but we want all of our colors to be overlaid on top let's also go ahead and save the seen here because I am a chronic saver and I cannot stop myself from hitting ctrl s let's go and save it as something like mane so that I can span that along the way and let me see oops I have something open here that I want to close there we go so um the first thing that we could go ahead and do here is maybe create the movement of our player so in order to do that let's go and create a new 2d object sprite and the sprite that we want to select here is the knob we can use that you can also create your own circular sprite and I want to set the scale here to something like 2 by 2 maybe 3 by 3 I don't want it to be too big and the color here we'll just stay white for now but you do want the base sprite to be white so that you can tint it during the game if the base flag was black we wouldn't be able to change the color so you can of course also have multiple sprites that you swap in and out but we'll just be tending this one sprite so you can see now here that we now can actually control the color as we want and we can do that at run time as well so let's go ahead and rename this guy to player and let's also add a new component and the component that we want to add is is a custom see sharp script called player and let's hit create a net and let's double click this to open it up in Visual Studio I hope you guys didn't miss too much all we did was create a player script and in here we deleted the start method and the to using system tags up here and we of course plays the script on the player and now we are creating a variable called jump force it's a public float and I'll just default this to ten and this is of course the height that you will jump and then we also need a reference to our rigidbody we'll be creating a rigidbody on the object in just a second and you can use get components for this but I'm just going to go ahead and make a public rigidbody 2d and call it something like RB so we can just drag it in in the inspector then in the update method will check if input does get buttondown and the button that we want to check for here is jump we could also go ahead and maybe check for a mouse click if you want to use that button instead so I'm going to go input dot get mouse button down and the mouse button that we want to check for is zero meaning be a left mouse button cool so oh and we don't want this to be and we want this to be or so two vertical bars so that either one of these will trigger cone then we want to go ahead and jump and we do this by saying RB dot and we could go in here and add a force in the upwards direction using our jump force but that is actually not give us these going to give us the logic that we want because if we go ahead and play the mobile game or flappy bird for that matter these games instead of adding a force simply change the velocity of the player because if the player falls a certain distance we don't want the force to be to be competing with this downwards velocity instead we just want to completely ignore that and then give him a straight upwards velocity and that's going to give more much more predictable movement so we're going to instead going to go in here and say I'll be dubbed the velocity and set this directly to a vector to dot up multiplied with our jump force like that cool so now if we just go in here and save that we'll also go in and add a new component and we're going to add the red lips the rigidbody2d and also a circle Collider 2d and the circle Collider we are going to mark as a trigger and we also want to adjust this so I'm going to say point zero nine and zero eight I like this to be kind of a bit inside of the actual graphic so that you're certain that you won't have a situation where the player when I made that and he really did so you want that to be normally a bit narrower than the graphics of the circle and then the rigidbody here I'm going to bump up the gravity to three just to make him fall a bit quicker I find that that just makes the game feel more interesting and we can then take a rigidbody and drag that into the RB slot so now when we hit play we should see that we are able to yeh click a mouse or use our jump button in order to have this jumping movement and it's actually already really fun to do this so I could do this flowers anyways so um other than that that's not too much we need to do you could go into the rigidbody 2d here and add a constraint on the xaxis and also freeze rotation around the z just to make sure that our player will always only move up on the Y no matter what happens it's just good practice and then what we want to do is of course have some kind of rotating color wheel and you can make this a triangle you can make it a square some kind of pulley he'd roll publish something with polygon and you could also make it a circle it's totally up to you I simply went into Photoshop here and created this circle here which using the rulers which you can get like this I split up into four different parts one is sine one is yellow one magenta and one pink and I then copied this into three different sizes and made sure that the thickness of the line was always the same and then you can go ahead and X or any one of these elements so one by one exploit these into a sprite or you could go and make a sprite sheet out of this by simply separating all of them into kind of a on single image like this to make sure that you can splice it up any way that you want so I went ahead and did this to the small circle and that's what I have lying on my desktop here so this is just four parts of a circle that I've separated out a little bit and colored in four different colors and again if you want to follow your along using my version of this I will have it up on github when the video goes live on youtube so don't worry about that that will be a link in the description if you are watching this on YouTube cool so in here we don't need to configure too many settings pretty much the only thing that we need to do is change the sprite mode from single to multiple because we have four sprites in here and we need to go into the sprite editor hit apply and we then need to go up here and say slice and then slice and now you can see that we've sliced it unity has sliced this into four sprites and if we apply now it is going to be visible in the project panel as well we now have one two three four circle parts here so really quick and easy to do now we want to take all these circle parts and drag them into the unity editor to play with into our scene view here and we can maybe take all them and actually we'll move these in a second we'll take our player for now and drag them down a bit and for the circle talks here we need to let's see we need to set these up so that they align so let's take our first one or which is the second one here the one with index one drag that over until they align and I'm just going to do this using the measurement of my eye but you can of course go in here and do the math I think that's fine then we're going to take the I think it's this one nope the magenta one which is this one and we need that to have the same x value as the yellow one so let's copy the X here paste it over here and now we can take these last two ones the pink and the magenta and we can move those down together they're awesome and now we have a circle split up into four different colors and again be precise with this but because we on stream I'm just doing this really quickly so now we can go ahead and create an empty object and we'll reset the transform on that and we'll call this one something like a small circle in one word I'm going to do that cool and we can take all of our parts and put that those inside of this small circle here and we can also align these to the center so I'm just going to use the points where the color split here in order to align it to the center that would be there and there cool so now we have all of these different parts inside of a parent object called small circle that we can place anywhere we would like and when we now go ahead and rotate this parent object around the zaxis we should see that our color wheel is rotating along awesome just the way we wanted so we could go in here and rename the different circle parts now just to make everything a bit easier so let's name this one cyan this one yellow this one pink and this one magenta and I'm going to drag the magenta up here so it's right before the pink one and we need to select all of these different parts now and add some colliders so let's go in here and add some polygon colliders and this is not particularly pretty I will give you that but I actually found that it's the only Collider that kind of works for this instance because the circle Collider does never radius or I mean I doesn't have a width you can see that doesn't really work for our case we also have the box colliders but it's spending we could reduce experiment with some edge colliders that might produce alrightalright results here but we would have to configure these quite a bit so it's not really too much yeah that works better than the polygon colliders here so I think we'll just go with that we can take our play here and shrink down the radius of him even more to adjust for any kind of errors it doesn't have to be too precise they don't think for this kind of game cool so now we need to of course rotate our circle over time so to do that we're going to hear me add a component on a small circle called the rotator and this is also going to be a csharp script and let's double click that to open it up in visual studio reload all and everything is good we can delete the two using system tags up there again and we can also delete this start method once more we do need a public float here and this is going to be the rotation speed and I'm just going to call this one speed and the fold it to maybe something like a hundred so that means that we're going to move a hundred degrees every second so now inside of our update we can take the transform of our current object that the rotator script is sitting on and we can use the rotate method in order to rotate it around its center and we want to rotate it zero on the X 0 on the Y and we want to rotate it our speed on the Z multiplied with and this is important that you write time Delta time in order to make sure that we even out differences in frame rate I've talked about time to does a time a bunch of times if you want to get a better understanding of it I suggest you check out the on unity tutorial on a bullet time effect or slow motion that I have on my youtube channel there we go into time that does a time what it means versus time dot fixed of the time and all these different time related stuff so check that out if you want for now just make sure to write it here because then our speed our rotation speed won't be frame rate on dependent cool so now that we save that that should actually be all we need to do for our rotator script it's just hitting play and it's rotating and we also of course have our player movement working so yeah we have something that somewhat resembles a game already only thing is of course we aren't really able to lose or win but let's just call it a game we can call this one interactive art for now so now we need to take our player here and make sure that it will always be drawn on top of everything else that we make in order to do that let's create a new sorting layer and it's called this one the player layer and we'll select a player and apply that sorting layer there now we are sure that he is always going to draw on top um then we can go ahead and make the actual hit registration and we do have colliders on our different circle elements and we also have a Collider on our player so all we need to do now is go inside of our player script and you could definitely put this inside of a separate script and I'll create a method that will register whenever we collide with something and we know that method it's one of unity spilled in callback methods it's on trigger entered 2d and you use 2d here every time you're dealing with 2d colliders if not used to delete that and you have the 3d equivalent so Ontario into 2d is going to be called every time we collide with something and um what we want to do is gather some information about what we collided with because whether or not we lose or succeed totally depends on what color the object we collided with this and we're going to define the color of the object using a tag so we want to check first of all I gather some information about what we hit and then check if that tag is the same color as ours and if it is not well then we messed up so in order to gather some information about what we hit we create a variable here called collided to or of type Collider 2d and we can call it something like Cole let's refer to it as called meaning they Collider that we just hit and then we check if Cole tack is equal to whatever color we currently have so now we can just go ahead and debug the log call dot tag and that means that whenever we collide with something we're going to write its tag in the console so now inside of unity we can go ahead and hit play and we should see that every time we collide with one of these things it's going to say on tags because we haven't applied a tag yet then for each circle element we can go ahead and add a new tag I mean I can go ahead and add all of the different colors to this tax rate we have this sign we have the yellow we have the magenta and the pink cool so now for the sign we'll add the sign for the yellow we'll add the yellow the magenta we'll add the pink and screaming will add the magenta and for the pink will add the pink code so now we have all these different objects with the correct tax applied and yes you could go ahead and use the name instead of the tag it's a bit maybe a bit too much that I have all them change names as well as tags but I think it's better to use tags because then you are reducing the amount of places that you could arm that you could mess up your writing so definitely recommend using using text for this so inside a visual studio we can now check okay let's just see if this is working first so we apply here and we collide with Sian it's a scientifical ID with yellow magenta it says yellow and magenta and the same thing with the pink cool so now inside the visual studio we can check if Cole tag is equal to and then we can check if it's equal to yellow we can check if it's equal to magenta and you get the idea however we of course need to define a color for a player in order to to do this check so how do we assign a color to all players well there is a bunch of different ways that you can do this and this might not be the prettiest but it's really easy to understand and quick to set up so this is probably the way that I would go about it if I was doing a gem and that is simply keeping all of the code inside of the player method you could go ahead and separate this out into a color manager method that has an array of colors maybe an in enumerator or an enum instead with the different colors with nice with a singleton pattern and you can go ahead and call functions for setting and getting colors and all that fancy stuff but that also doubles development time and because this is a live stream we'll do it the quick fast and fun way and that means that we'll go in here and we'll create a public string and this is going to be our current color and we'll default this and we actually don't want to default this will also make a void start and right when we start the game we want to get a random color and we want to do this multiple times during the game so let's just make a method for that let's call it something like set random color and let's go down here in order to create it that students at the bottom so void set random color and because we know all of the different colors that is going to be in the game which is only four and we know that we're never going to change this and so I'll write to hardcode the same so we'll go Ginn's index in order to get a random value between zero and three meaning zero one two three four different numbers equals random range so this is going to give us that printim number between zero and three and we can then go ahead depending on what number we got switch to a certain color so we'll make a switch statement here and the value that we want to have different cases for is the index and will open and close some curly brackets and then we can write out our different cases now I found out recently that a lot of people actually aren't familiar with using switch statements a lot of beginners only know the basic if statements and maybe a four or for each loop switch statements is something that you don't use as often but they can just be really handy syntax wise they basically allow you to more easily create a series of statements we could go into and say if indexed this equal to zero there's one thing is I do one thing and then else if index is equal to one and then do something else and then keep on going for all of the different are cases but that is pretty syntax heavy and it's also um it doesn't allow you to do or it doesn't as easily allow you to do stuff like default cases um breaking and or falling to other cases I'll show you guys this in a second so here we basically do the same thing we say that we want to have a look at our index value and depending on what it is we want to do different stuff in the case that it is zero we want to do this line right here and what we want to do here is maybe said our current color equal to I will just use the first one which is sign and we then break which means that we exit the switch statement then in case one we want to set current color equal to yellow and we then break as well in case of two we said current color equal two and then we go on magenta and we break us once and in case three we set current color equal to armed and we'll go pink cool so we very easily go ahead and define different cases and if I'm not mistaken this is actually also lighter on the compiler so this will actually happen quicker but there might be some optimization behind the scenes where it recognizes these patterns and if statements and automatically convert them converts them into switch statement I don't know exactly how that works so I'm not going to put my word on it but um your switch statements they are awesome so we have all these different cases and now we should see that when we start our game our current color get set to random color so let's hit play here or let's elect our player and it's hit play and we should see the current color here set to magenta if we try and do that again it's set to yellow whoops with a spelling error and yeah you can see the yellow again there we also have the Scion awesome so I just need to go in here and this is really the danger of doing it this way is that you are prone to spelling errors so make sure to spell things the exact correct way and thank you for pointing that out in the chat I might not have seen it um so yeah so now we set a random color however you will see that the color of our object doesn't actually change so in order to change that we need to access the sprite renderer and set the color property so how to do that we need of course a reference to our a sprite renderer sprite renderer and we'll call this one SR and we also need four different colors we could just go in here and use the default ones color dots I and called magenta actually if it has all of them doesn't have pink all right we'll have to do it then so we can go in here and define our own one we're going to create a public color and this is going to be our color cyan we'll create a public color color um yellow that's a lot of extra typing for this one color magenta and public color color and then pink cool so down here we can then set s our color equal to color cyan or and down here we can do yellow down here we can do magenta and here we can do pink so color yellow color Jesus color magenta and color pink ha I think we made it guys I almost passed out at the pink one too many colors Jesus imagine if we had five or six all right so um why don't you use a color array and use the int as index you could do that just as well and it wouldn't make a difference I'm just hard coding things in here because I don't want to do extra work but you could just as well use anyway if you want so whatever you want to do so that should not work and if we exit out of on Visual Studio we can see now that we have a sprite renderer slot where we'll drag this one in we'll have all these different colors so we can go ahead and color pick the sign here and make sure that you pump up the alpha as well or else it's going to be invisible so make sure to full max out the alphabet on all of these as well so we'll set the whoops that's not the pink one there we go and for the pink here as well cool now when we add play yes we turn into a random color that's awesome we don't actually have this comparing of the tanks yet but that is really really easy to create on top so we had yellow twice in a row there and now we have sine cold so now all we need to do is go into the script here and use and use on trigger Institute II here to check if collider tag is equal to our current color and if it is we pass without anything happening however if it is not we messed up and bad things will happen so we're going here and throw a game over there we go so now if we play and jump up here so now we are signed let's see what happens if we make the jump everything is good but as you see whenever I touch any of the other colors it complaints cold and this is why you would go in and put some kind of death effects some kind of shattering into a thousand pieces and colored some kind of screen shake on the camera and then a way to restart the level we won't be bothering too much with that we can maybe go ahead and restart the level in just a second but first I wanted to show you how you can expand upon this so on the next thing that you probably want to make is a way for us to change color so let's go in here and create another on 2d objects sprite and we'll make this into a knob and we can make this two by two as well reset the transform actually and then make it two by two and we can drag this up on the screen here and we can make this on change our color actually of course if it's outside our screen we need to also have our camera follow the players so I actually just changed my mind let's leave this color changer here for just a moment while we make our camera follow the player so in the original game basically what we have is a situation where the player gets to jump freely but as soon as the player passes the midpoint our camera is going to follow him up so we basically have a still camera that makes sure to always stay at the same if not a greater yvalue than the player and so if we add a component here called something like follow player or follow target and we double click that and in here we again get rid of the system namespaces we create a public transform which is the reference to a playroom we can call it either player or target I'm just going to go with player and inside of our update method here we simply check if player dot position dot y is greater than or equal point it's greater than transform.position dot why so if our player has passed our current position we're going to set transform position equal to a new vector3 where on the x we have zero on the Y we have players position dot Y and on the Z we have negative ten or whatever your camera has you can also go in here and input transform that position dot X and transform that position dot ly it's not really going to matter too much in our case but this is a bit more stable it allows you to change things in here without stuff breaking so um yeah let's see here so people are saying random dud ranges between 0 & 4 I do not believe so let's see here's the people spamming that's quite a bit in the chat so I think for integers they are both inclusive so let's see here random that range zero and see here returns a random integer between minimum inclusive and maximum exclusive all right guys I'm sorry I messed it up you're right it should be between 0 & 4 good call Jesus I almost messed that up that makes sense because it's it basically the inclusive exclusive stuff it's made this way so that you can just use it with the length of an array without having to worry about it and the length of an array is always 1 greater than the index of the last element so that's why it's made this way but thank you for the save guys the spam can can stop you guys won good job cool so um yeah so now we have a reference to our player or we have a slot where we can reference our player and we can just drag him in and we should now see if we're playing that in the beginning here nothing happens and then as we continue upwards our camera is going to follow our position and it's not going to follow it down because I players that's falling down well then he's messed up but it's only one way to go here and that's up cool so um then what we want to do is of course have a look at the color changer here so I'm just going to go make this um black where these darker and I think in the original game it was a multicolored like on the circle here so you can go ahead and make a fancy sprite for that but for now I'm just going to do the dark one here and we actually don't need to add a custom component to this what we're going to do instead is simply do the triggering here again inside of the player I mean that's a bit easier at least so instead let's go up here and add a new tag to this and it's called this one on something like color changer and also on the color change your object we'll go ahead and add a circle Collider 2d and we'll snap this in Vice just a tiny bit so point zero nine cool so I believe that's pretty much all we needed to do for the color changer itself let's actually go ahead and turn this into a prefab and we could do the same with the small circle but I don't think that ok that's do it let's turn that into a previous one so now our color changes here which then we go into visual studio we check if code that tag is equal to color changer and if it is we're going to go ahead and set a new color so we're going to say set random color and then we're going to return so that we are not going to get a game overstatement cool so if we now hit play or whoops we also need to set the tag for the color changer man some of these things today it's it's bad so let's apply and let's hit play and let's see if this is working so we make it through here and we make it through there and indeed we change colors every time look at all the color changing it's awesome of course we also need to consume this um a changer here whenever we do this so let's go into Visual Studio let's say let's find a place here and we basically just want to destroy called dot game object there we go again if you're going to make this more serious game that you're going to work more on separate some of this code out from the player script it's not good to have all of this in one place it's just not good and maintain containable code this way but it should work so now we can jump in here and we can continue up and it consumes it and we change color so that is awesome of course I advise you to go in here also under your set random color and add some kind of a check to see if the color you've chosen is the one that you already have and if it is pick a new one so that's something that you can experiment here you don't want to change to another color that you already have this becomes a tiny bit easier actually if you're using the method where you add an array because it allows you to kind of simply X or remove an element from that array which is your current color and then picks a random one in the new array and then put everything back in but I think this method is simply too easy to to pass up cool so that's pretty much all of the logic that I wanted to show you guys how to do today I mean from here it's just a matter of creating some more levels you can duplicate the color circle and move it up here we can make another version of the color changer here we can go ahead and make another version of the circle and this time we'll go ahead and duplicate it and instead of just slicing it up here I do definitely recommend creating a nother sprite which is larger but has the same width because this way you are going to get varying width and then for each circle here we can vary up their speed so we can do a negative 40 on this one make it pretty so actually let's do the opposite let's make it super fast let's do negative one sixty and forth on this one we can go one hundred and then for this one we can go one hundred and 150 here so if we now hit play we should see on that we can actually play this pretty much the same way as the online game man I suck it's a good thing we haven't implemented scene reloading yet so yeah wait for these two to sting up and then go through wow I'm bad so um yeah so the final thing is just reloading the scene and in order to do that we simply go in here we use the whoops you singing unity engine that scene management and down arm here we say if Collider the tyre is not equal to current color we throw a game over statement and we say scene manager dot load scene and the scene that we want to load is two currently loaded scene so we get Seemandhra get active scene dot build index because we need to feed it the index at the scene and we then say that and boom we should have reloading when we mess up so let's see yes cool so that's all I wanted to show you guys today I hope you kind of like a little mini game here which I really really really need to improve on let's see if I can have like one go through if I concentrate don't talk too much oh Jesus oh this is the hard part now I didn't make I'm sorry alright so bad you're supposed to be good at the games that you make oh cool guys so I hope that you learned something from this example and now we'll go ahead and transition over to a Q&A style themed thing where you can ask all the questions that you want and we're also going to have a look at um the bottom tower game so maybe also play some others other guys a Ludum dare games that could be pretty fun but will definitely switch over to a more real next format now and yes that is the tutorial in so yeah remember that both this video will be of am YouTube and the entire project with scripts with the sprites that I used here and all the project files will be up on github so don't worry about that and also if you don't want to wait until this airs on YouTube you can go ahead and watch it immediately after on Twitch but that times out after a couple of you of weeks so let's go and switch to Q&A here is so there we go so ask away with your questions and I'll do my best to answer them as usual so let's see here um Q&A time yes so are you working on some game yourself or do make tutorial video streams exclusively I'm not working on a larger game project right now it's not something that I feel I have the time to do on top of everything else that I'm doing as you say with um with the videos and livestreams and dev assets but I love to do smaller hobby projects on participating in doodleberries it's just so much fun fun to do so it's not not because I don't want to it's more time thing the video will air on YouTube on this evening so later today I am how old am I haha twenty years old that is my age um seriously I wasn't out there for a second um can you make a video about writing basic shaders I think I covered doing something on shaded programming could be really fun at some point it's not something that I am too good at I mean I know how to write basic shaders and I know how to get some stuff of a running but for example for this first shader that I use for this is autumn dire I actually used another tutorial on to do that because it's not something that I immediately just knew how to do a really great one by N's nissim you can check that out he does a lot of graphics programming stuff that you can check out um let's see when I'm going to make a video about AI Oh soon it is coming I've actually been talking to some guys that we add unity and we're talking about ways that we can kind of collaborate on on video stuff with the unity learn team and I know both for them and for me like AI and knavish and the new national system is pretty much on the top of the list so you can you can definitely count on something being made there and someone has birthday congratulations it's awesome um let's see can you please make a tutorial about making a car that actually works something with car physics could be super fun now definitely I would I would love to do that at some point will you be doing a new tutorial series soon I don't have any plans for a particular series right now I've been enjoying doing standalone stuff quite a bit I just did three videos on kind of shooter related subjects which was all kind of for weapon related stuff which was weapon switching shooting with Ray cast and an ammo and reload system so that was kind of mini serious like but I don't want to go ahead and venture on out into any any large series me know what got you into YouTube that's a good question I actually started on YouTube with making um well in the very beginning it was montages of video games I really overrated montage stuff added a lot of fun with that um I started in Sony Vegas just mixing things together moved on to premiere moved on to After Effects and yeah when I went crazy from that stuff like I did some counterstrike montages some Call of Duty montages I also did Tudor was way back in the day on After Effects before really knew how to to do anything so I hope you guys won't find them ever I need to private them I think they are really embarrassing that's kind of how I got started with YouTube always been interested in the chin the nerdy tutorial stuff what's my favorite game hard question it's been asked before these these dreams I I actually don't know the answer I'm sorry I maybe it was the for craft um let's see um may I ask if you're needy was the first game program you made as a new user here if so where can I hear about you I'm not sure I understand the question sorry um let's see have you tried VR it depends on if you mean developing for VR or tried out some VR equipment I've definitely tried playing some VR games got my hands on the oculus development kit when that was really new I've also tried the HTC vive as some of that different stuff I've tried a bunch of on VR solutions now actually and it's it's really fun it's never really been much of an interest for me per se I feel like some of some people are really really into VR stuff um but I don't know it just it's fun for me but I think it's not something I would personally use on a daytoday basis and it's not something that I have a huge interest in developing for let's see do you have a lot of experience in unreal if yes how do you feel when switching from unity and viceversa I don't have a lot of experience in unreal I know my way around unreal sort of and I've used it for some things but I would never ever say that I have a lot of experience in unreal unreal II something that you have to develop for on a day to day basis in order to be I feel I'd say it's a huge Peters piece of software and it's constantly changing and yeah yeah I'm familiar with unreal that's it what age did you start creating games um don't know I think I started creating games when I rust around ten but when I say that you must take it with a grain of salt it was the simplest and simplest of software it was an old version of game maybe not the current game maker that we know now but a very very bad old piece of software from another company which was oh it was so bad I started making games in that moved on to the blender engine which I where I did a bit of being visual nerd scripting and then discovered unity and was just amazed about how much you could do and just how much cleaner of a tool it was and everything I'd been using so far so I think around 10 but it didn't really catch on until I was 14 or 15 or something like that um let's see I will object pooling mega huge difference in performance in this case what we're not instantiated anything so you wouldn't need to apply all the object cooling if you mean like enabling and disabling objects as we go it totally depends on how long your level is if you want to do a procedurally generated world here I would definitely recommend it especially because this is a kind of meant for mobile or with game so that would make a lot of sense what is the first game engine I used well that was the game maker if you can even call that thing an engine bad guy oh if any of you guys have ever used the old old game maker and know what I'm talking about I don't even know they don't even remember the name of the company anymore but yeah let me know how did I learn coding from tutorials have like two books and practice do you think it's worth it to learn csharp at school or learn it yourself well it really depends on how you like to learn if you are very much a social Persian person and need to be in kind of the social environment with others in order to learn something when then school can be great for you or if you feel like you don't have the discipline to sit down and learn a skill for yourself then school can also be a good way to do that you put into an institution and your deadlines you have things that you must do and you have a time where you need to get there and so um that can really help drive you along personally I don't do well under that kind of environment I'm much better at just putting tasks laying out tasks for myself and then completing them at my own pace and because I want to also because when you are self taught you can go ahead and not maybe focus so much on the having to learn all sort of stuff and then instead focus on the fun projects that you can do and and what something inspiring that you want to make and that that can really help drive on inspiration and fun in learning stuff like this that at least for me that is the main thing is just finding something that you want to make and then learning the tools required to make that that's always been the way that I've worked if I just sit down and say today I'm going to learn C++ I might write some C++ I might get a better understanding of C++ it but it's never the way that I get proficient with it that only happens if I have a project where C++ is required how long did it take you to grow your hair well it depends on the length I mean this long here it's really getting wrong now that has taken a taken a long time like a year or something but we're almost having cutted like trim day only but I mean it it took me three four months to grow long hair why don't you give objectoriented design tutorials well I do a lot of tutorials on objectoriented programming languages but nothing on like objectoriented design patterns so I don't know why haven't had that many requests for it that's why can you teach us how to make our game audible laudable functionality really depends on the game and it's something that you write particularly for every single game if you mean creating some kind of multiple script or some kind of mod scripting language like Lua there's plenty of tutorials on that actually cool eighteen is probably the person to check out he's done a lot of stuff with modding games so you can check out his tutorials but I don't have anything on the roadmap right now um let's see why don't you shake I do shave please be nice I shave regularly maybe not today but like few days ago um let's see are you a programmer or is it or is it a passion both um which programs did you use for little diary I think guys I think it's time to have a look at the little diary don't you want to do that I think I think I want to do that let's let's do it let's have a look at some dumb diary stuff so let me transition over here to my main scene there we go whoops look there are hundreds of me dancing actually there's as many of me dancing as there are pixels on the screen okay so let's uh find it here I'll just take away dancing me and let's go to the LG Chem website so I'm just going to log in here and I'm going to do that on the server monitor here and let's have a look at first of all of course my submission but also some of the ugly stuff on here so um cat first do you guys want to see the cat that receive this anything nearby look like the hero now I'm sorry I will make sure to pick them up if they if they come so yeah this is my submission it's called shrinking planet and die it's about little red car that drives around the road he likes driving and suddenly the planet gets um rained down upon by meteors and it's about surviving as long as you can there are links here for windows/mac and the source I'm just going to link this in the chat there you go if you want to go ahead and play it and here are the tools here so I have a bit of information here you can check out the the making off video it's right here I used unity five point six everything is written in C sharp I used Visual Studio as the code editor use Photoshop to do all the graphics stuff oops I forgot one I also use blender I'm gonna put that in here right now I used blender for all of them on there the modeling I used adobe audition for these sound and Busker sorry but you can see all something this this soft right here for the audio so a lot of fun and I'm just going to go ahead and play this now so let me bring it up I don't even know if I have it installed on my own system if I even created an installer let's go and find it on a project and then load them dari 38 and here we are build windows and here we go through the game boom and we should see that it jumps directly in here cool let me just actually turn on whoops oh no there you go mute myself and let's see everything is going crazy at once panic there we go okay and let me turn on test of audio here let me know how how loud this stuff is and if I need to balance anything up okay so here's the music and here's the game and I actually really like the menu screen that I decided to do here I like the fact that you can actually control the car during the menu screen here you can drive around you will just be able to drive through meteors because I didn't want the play to die going the menu but we have some controls you can quit and you can play and am I going through that include just to make sure I'm just going to bump down the music even more here cool then we can hit play and it's going to do the school zoom out and cementing and we are in the game and this is what it looks like I ended up doing this UI that followed kind of the shrinking planet which I really liked I spend a lot of time on kind of the graphics polishing for this game and wow that was that was bad let's try that again I did a lot of fun I work on the graphics polishing if you have a look at the smoke particles here you can see that I'm using the new noise filter for the particles which makes them look so much cooler and the cool thing is that as the planet shrinks so does the meteors here and they will actually disappear after a little while so you won't get too cluttered but it's still fairly highs and fairly hard and you have to have good reactions in order to do this so yeah it's the game let me see how far you can get here and then we'll boot up the unity project sorry I cannot talk while I'm focusing this no assets of that my personal record is 27 meters I know it doesn't look like that right now I think it's all was also the record actually that's not true my present I reckoned exactly is 27.5 and sophia's is 12 27.4 so please try and beat that so um yeah it's let's boot up the identity project here and i'ma show you around and I can see you requests on me trying out um Sebastian rigs game which yeah sure why not um so let me open up wait is it am I just totally missing it here oh it's probably because I moved it let me just reopen it and this is the low domed array 38 shrinking planet looks like that folder and have unity booted up we can have a look at it let's see here cool yeah and you guys got the link that's awesome this might take a little while because they are quite a few assets in here that's meanwhile while we're waiting we want to boot up let's check out Sofia's entry which I'm also going to link you and let's find this with a direct link called Meetup and she did a really cute I thought and kind of original twist interpretation of the theme it's about avoiding people you know on the UH on the street so you don't have to chat with them kind of another interpretation of a small world which I think was really nice so I'm just going to go ahead and throw you a link here and check that out I'm just going to boot up the web version here and show you guys what this looks like and see how well I can do let's see if everything is working here made with unity awesome so yeah she is called Betty our person of interest and these are the people that we need to remember so green red yellow black and blue all right in do that the music is really groovy here ah I'm counting myself at every single decision I don't is black like I think not her he's fine right yeah awesome and this one is definitely fine I love this sweater here see not that one he's fine as well that one is dangerous I think yes good yellow is dangerous as well right you guys can just screenshot it and see how bad this is yeah so with off I messed it up so really cute game I think stuff that could be added to this is a kind of a score modifier or score counter that shows how many friends or non friends that you've passed and maybe also something that could kind of expand upon the depth of the gameplay is have an array of people that you know and have that slowly get larger and larger so that the more you play the more people you know and so you both have to pay attention to that and remember new people as well as who is passing you by I think that could be a pretty fun thing and also of course when you're actually run into something have some kind of chat bubble up here um where where you're talking and you have to kind of sit through that that could also be be pretty fun so but really fun little game I think I'm pretty well done for for first time of course I am also biased so here is the UM the project for a shrinking planet and if we run and hit play here I can played in the editor and if I just pause this we can have a look around so basically the way that I did this was I created a planet which starts off at one one one and I the graphic here is just a sphere that I made in our blender it then has a Fox gravity attractor and I used a combination of different tutorials in order to get this right because I tried doing it on my own and I made it over complicated and this one is super simple it's something that I've done many times just implementing normally normal gravity attraction and then what I did was I wanted some objects to not only be attracted towards the center of the planet but just snap on top of the surface of that planet and there are used move position to just place them at the top of the planet by getting a vector that points from the center of our planet body dub position or transform the position and then subtract that from our body the position which is whatever we attracting here in order to get in a vector from the sender to a body normalize that and then multiply it with on the scale of our planet times the radius so just the radius of our planet so what this allows us to do is as our planet shrinks our car is always going to be snapped right at the top of that planet and that together with the script that shrinks the planet actually does all of the gravity calculations for us then all we have to do on the player object here is have a gravity body that places it on the surface together with the attractor and then a player controller and this is actually fairly simple recently move forward using RBW position and we don't have to worry about the fact that we are going in kind of a tangential line to where we want to be because that's going to be handled by the gravity attractor and then we simply apply some rotation to make sure that the bottom of our car always points toward the center and we also apply some rotation on top of that that is input driven and that's what I do here I get let's see here where is this that's here I get a delta rotation by converting our Y rotation into Euler hang or from Euler angles into a quaternion and I then apply that to our current with the body rotation and I then kind of smooth it out a little bit so yep ended up working it's maybe not the prettiest thing in the world but it ended up being fairly simple at least compared to what I did before and what I really liked about this one is probably just beyond the grasp and I ended up making I think it looks awesome and it's really really easy to adjust this wallet we go ahead and check the planet here and the grass shader and I want to switch to the default controls here actually let me just bring up the material two instead so we don't have this highlight you can see the awesome knobs here and this is all thanks to the tutorial that followed by Alan Taccone we can see how we can still have smoothness on the planet not that this is something that you particularly want actually could use a little bit and a metallic slider but much more important we have furlings you can go totally nuts with this we have the Alpha cutoff for our texture and the texture used here is just a symbol noise that we are generated and applied a few filters to you cut off at the end here we have the fading the amount of fade at the tips the gravity direction if you want to kind of shift that in a certain direction which is really really cool that you can do that as well on the gravity string and we also have stuff like the rim called oops this is something that I tried adding on top where is it um wind power where do they place this this is not yeah I ended up not using this I remember I tried to add kind of a rim fill but I didn't think it looked cool and so I removed it but for some reason I haven't removed key yeah I haven't removed the properties but it was in there at some point and also on the the particles for the meteors I think worked pretty well here you can bring up a media and have a look at it there we go and you can hear the sound here as well as we get closer this is just me saying Shh what I ended up working just fine actually let me play this and having a meteor that is actually flying towards the plane you can see I've messed up the shader here now but it's alright so here it is so I think this ended up being pretty cool I had a combination of trail rendering some particles and yeah just a bunch of particles actually on the light if I go ahead and play it a bit further here we can have a look at it once it gets closer to the planet let's take this one here you can see the actual light emitting on the arm planet we have this trail here if I go ahead and disable that you can see the effect of this so we have the sparks flying off it what's not simulating oh so annoying anyways on top of all the particle systems I have a trail render as well which just helps kind of define it a little bit and at the very tip I made sure to have kind of a clear if I select one of the other meteors I have kind of a clear um emissive texture that um I painted in Photoshop so that's this one under the particle system here the renderer the flare this is something I went into Photoshop and generated using just some noise filters and a bunch of glow and a bit of color and it really helped tie everything together at bat in the beginning I simply use the default particle and you can see that really doesn't look nearly as powerful but as soon as I went in and created this I really helped bring it to light and then of course the awesome part is the the smoke here has noise supplies applied to it which is what gives this random cool look also I have some skies in here around the planet that it are noticeable but just kind of a nice detail to help give more of a 3d feel to the game so yep pretty satisfied with the result of it I'm just going to undo a bunch of times here and and jump out of it and finally on do you guys have a game that I you wanted me to play I can check out the best and legs game for sure if you don't know him he's another job awesome unity tutorial maker check him out he made a game about ah a turtle which he also made a makingof video on I'm just going to get a link to it here find that real quick let me see the check see here yeah let me just get a show of hands how many of you guys participated in Ludum dare it right I did in the chat if you did that would be awesome to see here we go so I found this video and here is a link to the game there it is space turtle right so let's play it it's on edge that IO and hopefully ah know WebGL link wonder why all right I'll just go ahead and download it for windows here shouldn't take too long um let's see oh yeah awesome multiple people here oh thanks for the link to space turtle I was too slow to see that it's an OGG M game here okay so let's try out space turtle here let's raise turtle extract all right here come on speech there we go let's boot it up this is pretty cool I mean of course the levels here are procedurally generated and he did a lot of work on kind of smoothing out the planet and the ropes required a bit of math and I can understand from his video that he had a bunch of trouble getting things to work as he wanted them to but let's try it out it's pretty cool that he also added a networked high score you can check out his video if you want to learn more about that I actually didn't have time to do any kind of high score system I was too focused on graphics so hats off to you sir it's nice it's really good to have in these kind of small competitive games just some idea of how did I do it's really nice I think my game is is very much lacking in that department but yeah you can see the ropes here they are definitely working and it kind of adjusts itself to the position of of the arterial slowly whoops that was violent ha ha ha that was way too vile it Porto I and the planned explodes just using a bunch of rigid bodies it's it's definitely nice he also does a lot of other game development tutorials stuff you can check out some of his other making of videos or I think he calls them behind the scenes okay I'm too bad at this he did some some jams as well which were very published um so let's see ah who participated a lot of you guys did that's awesome if you guys have some links I can try some of it out here I've got one here this is from your sink la nine nine one oh this is beautiful oh I really like the graphics here it's awesome um and know what Yelp why why you guys no matter what deal um I mean I can I should really be mistaken this this is not made with unity but alright anyways I'm going to download it looks fun if it want to download uh yes okay so it's downloading twice now alright we only need to download once room number data Andrew normative exe I'm just going to put it up here transferring and I need to bring up the chat again so just disappeared cool run I'm excited now um I'm probably just gonna play this in there in window just so I can see everything else while it's running oh nice room number start oh also the music loving it start I have no idea how to play this welcome to the room number he had some rules to play this game may be you don't like it but I know you will have a great mind you can only move in one axis to move along all the tails and stand in front of the gate to open it you cannot move through one child twice you can see a cube in this level maybe is an obstacle or friend okay I didn't get a chance to read that I have no idea what I'm doing I'm just going to okay to cube don't know what I'm doing probably just trying to get over here right yes no oh I messed up okay we start yes yes I don't get this Oh everything needs to be read right okay yeah I got that but how how do I get past this guy this is this is too difficult for me am I being dumb or do you guys get this I'm sorry the setting is too awesome here I'm loving the click mechanics and I'd really like to highlight here click on the player okay I have to read this ah take the character I'm sorry ah there we go oh this is awesome loving the sounds and and this shifting colors in these make it really nice old portals yes so this takes me over there I would imagine and do I need to click on them to use them I'm still confused I'm just going to move in this direction okay and then if I move down here and then here and then over here let it correct I'll do that but I have to move here is that Alright and then there and over there yes no no ha ha I talk too much really well done game I think probably because I'm skewing right now way too difficult for me way too quickly I suck but I really liked the feel of the game the graphics are nice and once I get that you could click on the character it's also pretty selfexplanatory what you're able to do so awesome love it do you have more things from you guys here's one by on no kill this nope nope nope Noah Noah Kellis I'm gonna try it out here we go hey this is not um dari where is gluten where's the dari 14 days ago this is not good embarrassed to try what my team made yes bring it on okay play the game to do to do this looks really cold game link yes please and download for Windows yes it's downloading awesome let's see what other games do we have lined up yeah awesome so let me just drag this over here and we can pull it up I keep shrinking the chat for some reason there we go need to make sure that I don't miss something ah and here cool tabletop arena run and again probably want to run this in window what do you think about window frame the window uploading directed if I'm so cool hey oh what's up I'll so to teach you how to play the game oh it's about to move yeah left click to stab oh yes it's a dummy oh this is I'm already having fun with this okay you're probably supposed to save it I guess we're also by pressing shift okay that's really rewarding yes Congrats hahaha I love this SMS yep okay can i buy okay that's it awesome let's do this play the game okay so it's kind of an arena survival game classic topdown the dashing axe actually also damage enemy so it's it's only stabbing ouch okay it doesn't look like it oh this is awesome loving the techno music as well this guy probably whoa it's magic ouch this is just me embarrassing myself oh my god Jesus oh come on why I I can't hit the guy it's not it's not possible to be this bad come on Jesus what do I have to do but yes I did it right he's done what are the potion that's a trailer ah I'm dying this Jesus no norm of this no more public humiliation I'm done guys that's all you're gonna get I'm sorry it's ah ah horrible oh so much okay we're going to rev it up you guys that I had a lot of fun today often playing some of you guys games we can maybe play some more on next livestream I know it's going to be a whoops holy I know it's going to be a while then since Ludum dare a but I mean then we can also talk about kind of how we did can and have a little postmortem chat that could be really fun so that's it for this livestream I'm sorry when totally off track and we did crazy stuff but I had a lot of fun I hope you did as well and of course I will see you soon with another video the video that comes out this Sunday is actually super awesome it's going to be about the full postprocessing stack all the different image effects and also it the first sponsored video to come out on the breakage channel so I just wanted to let you guys know that that's the thing now I work together with skills here to create a sponsored video and that just means that we have an ad break in there it's not something huge I totally decided on the content myself and everything like that so just want to let you guys know that you should be prepared for that one definitely let me uh let me know when um when you see it and if there's anything I can do to improve that thing I don't normally do sponsored content and someone wanted me to say thanks for tuning in the break is thanks for tuning in at Preki and yeah awesome thanks for tuning in guys it was so much fun as always it's going to be up on the youtube channel it's going to be live here or available here on Twitch right after and thanks for watching if you want to get more of this sort of stuff you can go and support me over at patreon patreon comm slash brackets it really helps things going I keep things going and keep the lights on so that's awesome and on that thanks for watching and I will see you guys soon bye thanks to all the awesome patreon supporters who donated in April and a special thanks to Derek Hughes Kirk
