00:00 - in this video we're going to have a look
00:01 - at destroying things in unity this is a
00:03 - pretty easy and short video but creating
00:05 - shadow effects in unity is just so much
00:06 - fun so let's get started destruction in
00:08 - unity is something that can be achieved
00:10 - in two ways the first one is destroying
00:12 - your object through some kind of script
00:14 - here's an example of a unity asset that
00:16 - does exactly that we can see that it
00:18 - splits up our objects into chunks and
00:20 - then apply its physics to each chunk
00:22 - however this way is actually really
00:24 - performance intensive and also as you
00:26 - can see sometimes quite expensive what
00:28 - you can do for free is split up your
00:30 - model in some kind of modeling software
00:31 - this way you will have way more control
00:33 - over how the ARCIC shatters a good
00:35 - example of this is we create here we
00:37 - don't want to split this up into chunks
00:38 - instead we want all of the different
00:40 - wooden panels to separate and some of
00:42 - them to break so it looks like wood and
00:43 - the glass bottle here should for example
00:45 - be hollow of course not everyone knows
00:47 - how to do this stuff in the modeling
00:48 - program before the crate and bottle dark
00:50 - has actually gone ahead and made
00:51 - destructible versions already to
00:53 - download them we simply go to dev assets
00:55 - comm choose western props back to
00:57 - surprise and hit the blue button then to
00:59 - open the example scene that I'm using
01:00 - simply unzip the file double click on
01:02 - the folder and then double-click on the
01:04 - unity package right so let's begin with
01:05 - the crate let's go to western props
01:07 - prefabs and drag the wooden crate into
01:10 - our scene we can then hit F to focus on
01:11 - it and this is currently without a
01:13 - Collider so let's go ahead an add
01:14 - component box Collider and let's also
01:16 - add a rigidbody
01:17 - of course this model is not currently
01:19 - split up instead we have a separate
01:20 - version that wouldn't create cracked
01:22 - that if we drag it into the scene you
01:24 - can see all of the different pieces
01:25 - let's expand this in the hierarchy so
01:27 - like the first piece hold down shift and
01:29 - select the last piece as well to select
01:30 - all of them
01:31 - that's it add component and let's add a
01:33 - mesh Collider of course mesh colliders
01:35 - are colliders that adjust themselves to
01:36 - the mesh we'll also have to check off
01:38 - convex here and now we can see all of
01:40 - the colliders in our scene view
01:41 - of course we'll also want to add rigid
01:43 - bodies to enable physics for these parts
01:46 - let's hit add component rigidbody let's
01:48 - have each of these parts be around 0.5
01:51 - kilos and set the mass of the wooden
01:52 - crate to something around 10 now all we
01:55 - need to do is substitute I wouldn't
01:57 - create the correct version whenever we
01:59 - want it to be destroyed let's take a
02:00 - wooden crate cracked here and drag it
02:02 - into the project panel to make a prefab
02:04 - out of it I'm just going to hit apply
02:05 - let's remove it from a scene select the
02:07 - wooden crate and add a new component we
02:09 - can call the script something like
02:11 - destructible like C sharp and hit create
02:13 - that let's double-click it to open it up
02:15 - in visual studio and of course what
02:17 - we'll be writing here it's going to
02:18 - depend on when you want your crate to be
02:20 - destroyed in our case we'll just set up
02:21 - a simple example where whenever we click
02:23 - on the create would give the actual
02:25 - destruction let's remove our two
02:26 - functions and instead write void on
02:29 - miles down now just like start an update
02:32 - on Mouse down is a callback function in
02:34 - unity that means that whenever unity
02:36 - detects we've clicked on the object
02:37 - onmousedown is going to be called this
02:39 - of course requires the object to have a
02:41 - collider but we've added that already so
02:43 - in here we can instantiate our splendid
02:44 - crate but first we need a reference to
02:46 - the object let's create a variable we'll
02:48 - make it public to access it in an
02:50 - inspector
02:51 - we'll make it of type game object to
02:52 - create a reference to a prefab and we'll
02:54 - name it something like destroyed version
02:57 - now in our onmousedown function will
03:00 - write instantiate to spawn an object the
03:02 - object we want to spawn is the destroyed
03:04 - version we want to spawn it at our
03:06 - current position so we'll input
03:08 - transform dot position and with our
03:10 - current rotations that will input
03:11 - transform rotation as well and let's
03:14 - close this off with a semicolon now of
03:16 - course other than spawning the new
03:17 - version we also have to delete the old
03:19 - one so to do that we simply write
03:21 - destroy and then input game object with
03:23 - a non-capital key this refers to our
03:25 - current object that the script is
03:27 - setting on that's actually all of the
03:29 - coding that we need to do now we can
03:30 - just save this script head back into
03:32 - unity we can see a new empty slot here
03:34 - this is where we can drag in a wooden
03:36 - create cracked prefab try saying that
03:38 - three times over let's have a look in
03:39 - that game view here and we can easily
03:41 - see the crates so we can just go ahead
03:42 - and hit play and when we now click on
03:44 - the crate it shatters and just to show
03:50 - you how easy this effect is to apply to
03:52 - other objects as well we'll take the
03:53 - whiskey bottle and drag it into our
03:55 - scene hit F to focus on it we'll go
03:57 - ahead and add a new Collider you could
03:58 - of course go for a mesh Collider here
04:00 - but I think the box Collider will do
04:01 - just fine let's add one let's also add a
04:03 - rigidbody and our destructible script
04:06 - now we can turn down the mass to be
04:07 - something like point five and we of
04:09 - course need to create a destroyed
04:10 - version to do that we just drag in the
04:12 - whiskey bottle correct we can see that
04:13 - this only has two parts let's select
04:15 - both of them hit add component mesh
04:17 - Collider let's make sure to check off
04:19 - convex and we'll also add a rigidbody
04:21 - finally we can set the mass to something
04:23 - like point to make a prefab out of this
04:25 - object again I'm just going to
04:27 - apply remove it from a scene select a
04:29 - whiskey bottle and I'll drag in that
04:31 - prefab now this might be a bit hard to
04:33 - see with our current camera angle let's
04:34 - use a nifty trick from my recent top 10
04:36 - unity tips video so let's get a good
04:38 - look in our scene view let's just zoom
04:40 - out here a bit so we can also see the
04:42 - crate somewhere around here let's select
04:44 - our main camera and hit control shift F
04:46 - that's going to align our camera without
04:48 - seeing you we can also easily check our
04:50 - whiskey bottle and just duplicate it a
04:51 - few times and move it around just so we
04:53 - can see this working on multiple objects
04:55 - let's now hit play and you can see that
04:57 - we can now shatter these balls and it
04:59 - looks awesome and of course the create a
05:01 - small let's pretty much all I wanted to
05:03 - show you in this video this is really
05:04 - one of those very simple techniques that
05:06 - you can just have so much fun with if
05:08 - you want to challenge yourself you can
05:09 - experiment with creating a script that
05:10 - will make an object shatter if it falls
05:12 - from a high enough distance here's a
05:14 - hint on how to do that on the screen oh
05:15 - and I will of course go ahead and add
05:17 - all of the colliders and rigid bodies to
05:19 - these prefabs so that when you download
05:20 - the pack everything just works right
05:22 - away
05:22 - I'll even include the example script
05:24 - just make sure to add it to the objects
05:26 - yourself so that was pretty much it for
05:27 - this video I hope you enjoyed it if you
05:29 - did make sure to subscribe so you don't
05:30 - miss another video I upload Sundays and
05:32 - when I space also if you're a fan of the
05:34 - videos and want a hill back you can go
05:35 - to patreon.com/crashcourse to make a
05:37 - muscly donation of your choosing so have
05:39 - fun with the effect and I will see you
05:41 - in the next video thanks to the awesome
05:43 - people who donated in January and a
05:45 - special thanks to Derek James Kirk
05:46 - Chaisson verify James Callaghan Robert
