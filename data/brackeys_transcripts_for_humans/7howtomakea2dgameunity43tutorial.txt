00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number seven in going
00:07 - to Dee today we are going to be taking a
00:09 - look at adding some audio to your game
00:12 - we're also going to do a few other
00:13 - things here's the list for today first
00:16 - off we are going to delve into physic
00:18 - iterations with just just a quick fix to
00:21 - make the collisions in our game a bit
00:24 - more accurate the next up we are going
00:26 - to add some sound effects and some
00:28 - backing background music and then at
00:31 - last and this is only if we have time
00:33 - we're going to add a reset and a quit
00:36 - button so cool that's the format for
00:39 - today so as always I've opened up unity
00:42 - here and if we go under edit project
00:46 - settings and then physics 2d you can see
00:49 - that I have bumped up the velocity and
00:52 - the position iteration so normally these
00:55 - are at 8 and 3 and they basically mean
01:00 - how accurately the computer is going to
01:04 - calculate collision between objects and
01:08 - what we want is we want to bump this up
01:11 - a bit because we only have a single
01:12 - rigidbody object in our scene and so the
01:18 - calculations that the computer is going
01:20 - to be doing are not that hard so we
01:22 - might as well make them very accurate
01:24 - and this number is of course going to
01:27 - depend on the platform you're publishing
01:30 - to because physics calculations can be
01:33 - harsh on the CPU which is the processor
01:36 - but again we only have one single rigid
01:40 - body element in the scene so I think
01:42 - we're going to be fine so I'm just going
01:44 - to bump the velocity iteration up to 15
01:47 - and the position position iterations up
01:51 - to 10 cool next up on our list is the
01:57 - sound effects so if you go ahead if you
02:01 - go to brackish comm you can download the
02:05 - 2d assets pack under the unity 2d course
02:09 - here and inside of this I've included
02:12 - some cool
02:13 - and effects and some music that you're
02:16 - free to add to your game also
02:18 - commercially it's completely
02:21 - royalty-free so if we go under the 2d
02:23 - assets pack here under the audio folder
02:26 - you can see we have a bunch of different
02:28 - things and let me just preview this I'm
02:30 - just going to bump down the volume a bit
02:33 - and let's start up with the background
02:36 - music and I've made sure that the
02:45 - background music will loop pretty nicely
02:47 - and seamlessly without weird clicking
02:50 - also we have a bonus song which which is
02:56 - great for pickups we have a click which
03:02 - is pretty subtle so it's something we're
03:04 - going to use whenever the ball hits our
03:07 - players we have a game over if you want
03:09 - to add a game over sound game over I've
03:13 - made that one myself and then we have a
03:16 - hit which is a little more violent so
03:20 - yeah feel free to use this however you
03:24 - want first off let's do the clicking so
03:29 - let's drag the click audio clip inside
03:32 - of unity here and simply release maybe
03:36 - let's make a folder for this so let's
03:39 - make a folder called audio and drag the
03:43 - click audio inside of that so double
03:46 - click it and in here select the click
03:48 - audio and we're going to change the 3d
03:51 - sound to false here so we're just going
03:54 - to disable that because this is a 2d
03:57 - game and we don't want the sound to be
03:59 - relative to the position from the sword
04:04 - or from the listener to the source we
04:06 - just wanted to be there simply so I just
04:10 - disable that and everything else here we
04:13 - can just leave we can make this native
04:16 - and not compress it because it's such a
04:19 - short sound so it's okay that it's
04:21 - really nice quality and and and
04:23 - therefore also a large size so let's hit
04:26 - apply
04:27 - and cool so now let's go ahead and
04:30 - program the functionality that will play
04:33 - this so if we go ahead and find our ball
04:36 - here we can okay so we can do a few
04:40 - things here we can place the script on
04:45 - the ball or on the players because we're
04:48 - going to be detecting whenever the ball
04:51 - hits the player so first off we can open
04:53 - up our ball control script simply
04:55 - double-clicking to open it up in
04:57 - monodevelop and just wait for it to open
05:02 - up probably probably here hmm
05:07 - monodevelop is acting a bit weird I
05:10 - think I'll just close it down and start
05:13 - it up again might need to pause the
05:15 - video here because I think monodevelop
05:19 - I stopped working here let's try this
05:22 - again so open up the ball control script
05:25 - and yeah this looks better cool so now
05:30 - it's working so let me zoom in on the
05:32 - text here and we can see that in here we
05:35 - have an on collision enter where the
05:39 - ball checks if we hit a player and then
05:41 - we add some velocity and this is the on
05:45 - collision enter which means that it will
05:47 - only be called once and this is really
05:50 - great for playing audio so we might as
05:52 - well add our audio here so now we can
05:55 - simply go in here and say audio dot play
06:03 - an inside of these parentheses you can
06:08 - input a name of the audio but because
06:13 - we're only going to have one audio
06:15 - sitting on our one audio source on our
06:19 - Bowl we can simply just leave it empty
06:22 - so now let's save this and hit back into
06:25 - unity and now we can make some audio for
06:28 - the script to play so now let's hit add
06:32 - component audio audio source inside of
06:38 - the audio source we're going to select
06:40 - the clip
06:40 - which is going to be the click then
06:44 - we're going to disable play on awake and
06:46 - make sure that loop is also disabled and
06:48 - just to make sure that this won't be too
06:51 - loud let's just drag it to something
06:53 - like 0.8 it's a great thing to mix
06:57 - everything not too loudly because if you
07:01 - have a player that opens up the game and
07:03 - everything just blows him away
07:05 - chances he's just going to mute it and
07:07 - that's not what you want you want him to
07:09 - be enjoying the audio that you made so
07:11 - just make sure that it's not too loud
07:13 - and then maybe add an option for volume
07:16 - control also you have better control
07:19 - over the maximum value or if your clip
07:23 - is pretty silent if everything is mixed
07:26 - down so just mix it down to start up
07:30 - with cool let's now hit play and see how
07:32 - the sounds we can hear the clicking
07:38 - sound playing whenever the ball hits a
07:41 - player great so that's exactly what we
07:44 - want now whenever it comes to a clip
07:47 - that is played as much as this one I
07:49 - mean it's almost played constantly it
07:52 - can quickly get annoying so here's a
07:54 - pretty cool tip for making it sound less
07:57 - repetitive right before the audio to
08:00 - play we do audio pitch and then we
08:04 - simply change the pitch using a random
08:07 - range so we are just going to change it
08:09 - with a random value so we do equals
08:13 - random range and then inside of this we
08:18 - can simply input to float numbers so
08:21 - something like and you can of course
08:23 - make these into variables up here um so
08:26 - you can change them inside of unity but
08:28 - I'm just going to hard-code them here so
08:30 - something like 0.8 this might be too
08:36 - much but it's good for demonstration
08:38 - purposes and then 1.2 F and then close
08:43 - it off and add a semicolon so now every
08:46 - time right before the audio plays it's
08:48 - going to randomize the pitch a bit and
08:50 - we can see the pitch value down here so
08:53 - when we hit play now
08:53 - [Music]
08:58 - we can see the pitch very and we can
09:00 - hear the small variations it's not much
09:14 - but it's enough that you will not get so
09:17 - annoyed by the sound constantly playing
09:22 - awesome so the next thing to do here is
09:25 - add the next sound effect so we could do
09:29 - something with the bonus let's let's add
09:33 - this whenever a player scores if you
09:36 - have made some AI so that the player is
09:39 - playing against an opponent you could
09:41 - add this sound when the player scores
09:44 - and this sound when the when the AR
09:48 - scores but we're not going to go into
09:50 - that so let's drag our bonus clip under
09:53 - the audio folder inside of unity let's
09:57 - go in here disable 3d sound leave it
10:00 - native and simply hit apply now we can
10:03 - go in here and let's see where this
10:06 - would be good to place so we have our
10:11 - ball here and our ball control script
10:13 - and it inside of this we called the
10:17 - reset ball function so it might be good
10:21 - to play using this I mean we also have
10:26 - let's see so we have the on collision
10:30 - you have the go ball
10:32 - that's not any of what we want so we
10:35 - might I mean it's easiest if you can
10:38 - just spread the different audio sources
10:40 - over a few different objects that way
10:43 - you don't have to switch out audio clips
10:45 - using variables that what that's what
10:47 - you normally do if you need to play
10:49 - multiple clips on one object but just to
10:53 - simplify things I would like this to sit
10:55 - on another object so maybe in here where
10:59 - we detect whether or not something is
11:02 - head so here with the side walls inside
11:05 - of this script we could add something
11:07 - yeah let's let's actually go ahead and
11:09 - do that so inside of this if hitting
11:13 - info dot name is equal to ball it sends
11:16 - out the reset ball and it scores and all
11:18 - that let's play the audio in here
11:20 - so let's simply do right before game
11:24 - manager that score we're just going to
11:25 - do audio dud play and you can add the
11:30 - pitch randomization here also it's not
11:34 - played as much so I'm just going to
11:36 - leave it because I'm lazy but feel free
11:39 - to do it then under then simply select
11:41 - the left and the right wall hit add
11:44 - component audio audio source to add it
11:47 - to them both make sure to disable play
11:49 - on your wake bump down the volume a bit
11:51 - and then under the audio clip we can
11:54 - just select the bonus here and yeah
11:57 - these settings have applied to both the
12:00 - walls and let's hear how this sounds
12:06 - that's just perfect
12:07 - close so now we also have a scoring
12:09 - sound that's basically all the sound
12:12 - effects that I feel like we need you can
12:15 - also add something for every time the
12:16 - ball collides and you can do that just
12:19 - using a normal on collision enter and
12:21 - then switching out the source down here
12:26 - but again that's not something we're
12:28 - going to go into this is a pretty simple
12:30 - game and audio was not the primary theme
12:33 - for this for this series so next thing
12:38 - on our list is the music so let's add
12:41 - some background music to our game so to
12:46 - add background music here let's just
12:48 - first off drag it into unity so drag it
12:50 - onto the audio folder and this is going
12:53 - to take a little while to import
12:55 - whenever it comes to optimizing your
12:59 - game in terms of storage so that it
13:01 - won't be too large for uploading audio
13:04 - is really something you need to go after
13:07 - you because all you really quickly gets
13:10 - really large in file size so watch out
13:14 - with long clips this is actually pretty
13:17 - long it of course depends on the
13:20 - platform it would be
13:21 - line four a PC downloadable but if this
13:24 - is going to be a mobile game I would say
13:27 - that this track is a bit too long also
13:30 - make sure that you do this in a
13:32 - compressed format whenever the clip is
13:35 - so long this one is mp3 which is already
13:40 - compressed so let's disable the 3d sound
13:43 - here and let's match the compression
13:45 - with what I've made so that's two
13:47 - hundred and twenty eight so simply hit
13:51 - apply and actually let's also make this
13:54 - stream from disk which is a great thing
13:56 - to do when it comes to music now let's
13:59 - hit apply and it's going to reemployed
14:02 - everything again so all of the these
14:06 - sounds I've included in the pack are
14:08 - already optimized for for game making
14:12 - but just make sure you don't just
14:14 - download a song and put it in there it
14:17 - will be too large in the end awesome
14:20 - so let's now add this to the game and we
14:23 - can just add this to the GM object I
14:25 - think that would be pretty well relevant
14:27 - so sick select the GM object go to audio
14:31 - audio source and add the clip
14:34 - background music hit play on awake and
14:37 - set loop to true and then just bump down
14:40 - the volume a lot because background
14:43 - music doesn't need to be too loud so
14:45 - that's here now I actually think that's
14:51 - pretty awesome
14:51 - so that's just going to keep on playing
14:53 - and once it's finished it's going to
14:56 - loop and it's gonna sound nicely so that
14:59 - was it for the audio part of this video
15:02 - I think we're gonna go ahead and save
15:05 - the GUI for another video umm but yeah
15:10 - so that was basically it for this one
15:12 - thanks for watching and I'll see you in
15:15 - the next video
15:19 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to video number seven in going to Dee today we are going to be taking a look at adding some audio to your game we're also going to do a few other things here's the list for today first off we are going to delve into physic iterations with just just a quick fix to make the collisions in our game a bit more accurate the next up we are going to add some sound effects and some backing background music and then at last and this is only if we have time we're going to add a reset and a quit button so cool that's the format for today so as always I've opened up unity here and if we go under edit project settings and then physics 2d you can see that I have bumped up the velocity and the position iteration so normally these are at 8 and 3 and they basically mean how accurately the computer is going to calculate collision between objects and what we want is we want to bump this up a bit because we only have a single rigidbody object in our scene and so the calculations that the computer is going to be doing are not that hard so we might as well make them very accurate and this number is of course going to depend on the platform you're publishing to because physics calculations can be harsh on the CPU which is the processor but again we only have one single rigid body element in the scene so I think we're going to be fine so I'm just going to bump the velocity iteration up to 15 and the position position iterations up to 10 cool next up on our list is the sound effects so if you go ahead if you go to brackish comm you can download the 2d assets pack under the unity 2d course here and inside of this I've included some cool and effects and some music that you're free to add to your game also commercially it's completely royaltyfree so if we go under the 2d assets pack here under the audio folder you can see we have a bunch of different things and let me just preview this I'm just going to bump down the volume a bit and let's start up with the background music and I've made sure that the background music will loop pretty nicely and seamlessly without weird clicking also we have a bonus song which which is great for pickups we have a click which is pretty subtle so it's something we're going to use whenever the ball hits our players we have a game over if you want to add a game over sound game over I've made that one myself and then we have a hit which is a little more violent so yeah feel free to use this however you want first off let's do the clicking so let's drag the click audio clip inside of unity here and simply release maybe let's make a folder for this so let's make a folder called audio and drag the click audio inside of that so double click it and in here select the click audio and we're going to change the 3d sound to false here so we're just going to disable that because this is a 2d game and we don't want the sound to be relative to the position from the sword or from the listener to the source we just wanted to be there simply so I just disable that and everything else here we can just leave we can make this native and not compress it because it's such a short sound so it's okay that it's really nice quality and and and therefore also a large size so let's hit apply and cool so now let's go ahead and program the functionality that will play this so if we go ahead and find our ball here we can okay so we can do a few things here we can place the script on the ball or on the players because we're going to be detecting whenever the ball hits the player so first off

much so I'm just going to leave it because I'm lazy but feel free to do it then under then simply select the left and the right wall hit add component audio audio source to add it to them both make sure to disable play on your wake bump down the volume a bit and then under the audio clip we can just select the bonus here and yeah these settings have applied to both the walls and let's hear how this sounds that's just perfect close so now we also have a scoring sound that's basically all the sound effects that I feel like we need you can also add something for every time the ball collides and you can do that just using a normal on collision enter and then switching out the source down here but again that's not something we're going to go into this is a pretty simple game and audio was

add this to the game and we can just add this to the GM object I think that would be pretty well relevant so sick select the GM object go to audio audio source and add the clip background music hit play on awake and set loop to true and then just bump down the volume a lot because background music doesn't need to be too loud so that's here now I actually think that's pretty awesome so that's just going to keep on playing and once it's finished it's going to loop and it's gonna sound nicely so that was it for the audio part of this video I think we're gonna go ahead and save the GUI for another video umm but yeah so that was basically it for this one thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
