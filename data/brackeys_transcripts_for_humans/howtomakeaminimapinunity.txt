00:00 - in this video we'll make a mini map
00:01 - using rendered textures let's get right
00:03 - into it so as you can see I have this
00:04 - very simple scene with a player that we
00:07 - can move around but of course it's very
00:10 - much in need of a mini-map but in order
00:12 - to create a mini-map we need a second
00:14 - camera that can render our scene from a
00:16 - top-down view to do that let's deselect
00:18 - everything right-click in our hierarchy
00:20 - and select camera let's then reset the
00:23 - transform on our camera and make sure
00:25 - that this sits at the same position as
00:26 - our player to do that we can select our
00:29 - player right click on his transform hit
00:31 - copy component we then select our camera
00:34 - right click and hit paste component
00:36 - values but we want to move our camera up
00:38 - so let's drag up on a y2 something like
00:41 - 20 let's also flip the camera so it's
00:43 - facing downwards we do this by rotating
00:45 - by 90 degrees on the X and first off we
00:48 - want to make sure that we have all the
00:50 - same settings as our previous camera
00:51 - because in most cases you probably want
00:53 - to render the seam in pretty much the
00:55 - same way to do that let's select our
00:57 - previous camera hit right click copy
00:59 - component it's like our new camera and
01:01 - paste those back in in my case this just
01:04 - changed the background to a solid color
01:06 - then we can change the projection from
01:08 - perspective to orthographic this pretty
01:11 - much just removes all perspective from
01:13 - our scene this is something that almost
01:15 - all minimaps do it's great because it
01:17 - gives the impression that the scene is
01:18 - laid out flat we then use these sides to
01:21 - zoom out on our mini-map and you can
01:23 - choose the size of your zoom here you
01:25 - can have it show the entire level at
01:27 - once or have it only show a small part
01:29 - of your level but then follow around the
01:31 - player I'm just gonna set mine to 15 we
01:33 - can also delete our audio listener our
01:35 - GUI layer and off layer layer we only
01:38 - want to be using the camera but
01:40 - currently our mini-map is overlaid on
01:42 - top of the entire screen and that's not
01:44 - really the effect we're going for we
01:46 - want our mini-map to be shown as part of
01:48 - our UI
01:49 - let's now rename this object call it
01:51 - mini-map camera let's go into the scene
01:54 - view and let's create another object
01:56 - this time we are going to go under UI
01:58 - and we're going to select raw image we
02:01 - then switch into 2d mode and hit F to
02:03 - focus on a raw image now a raw image is
02:06 - basically like any other UI image
02:08 - component except it takes in a texture
02:11 - instead of a sprite this is good because
02:13 - basically going to tell our mini-map
02:15 - camera to take everything it renders and
02:17 - put it into a texture this is called a
02:20 - render texture we can then take that
02:22 - texture and display it on a raw image
02:24 - let's select our 2d controls up here
02:27 - let's zoom out a bit and now we can
02:29 - position our mini map where we want it
02:31 - I'm gonna anchor mine to the top right
02:33 - here I'm gonna set the offset on the X
02:35 - to negative 75 and the same thing on the
02:38 - Y I'm gonna set the width and height to
02:40 - something like 170 by 170 and then gonna
02:43 - offset it on the X&Y by about 110 so now
02:47 - in our game view we should see a white
02:48 - square in the top right corner of where
02:50 - our mini-map is going to be but of
02:52 - course we still need to display our
02:54 - texture to do that we create a new
02:56 - render texture let's go to the project
02:58 - right click go create and now select
03:00 - render texture and let's call this our
03:02 - mini-map render texture here we have a
03:05 - bunch of texture settings we're gonna
03:07 - leave pretty much all of them as is our
03:09 - link to where you can read about these
03:11 - in the description first off we can set
03:13 - the size to the same as our raw image
03:15 - let's set it to 170 by 170 and we can
03:18 - also disable our depth buffer if we now
03:20 - select our mini-map camera we can see
03:22 - here that there is a target texture
03:25 - variable and this takes in a render
03:27 - texture let's simply drag our mini-map
03:29 - Brenda texture into this slot and you
03:31 - can see now that our game view switches
03:33 - back to our main camera so a mini-map
03:35 - camera is no longer rendering on screen
03:37 - instead all of its data is being fed
03:39 - into this mini map render texture and if
03:41 - we click on it we can actually see the
03:43 - preview here so now all we need to do is
03:46 - select our raw image and drag in our
03:48 - mini map render texture as the texture
03:50 - input and voila our camera is now
03:52 - rendering directly onto the screen as a
03:54 - hue il iment now we can rename this to
03:57 - our mini-map and if we now hit play and
03:59 - start moving around the scene you can
04:01 - see our player moving around of course
04:03 - our mini-map isn't following our player
04:05 - yet but we can add this very easily also
04:08 - remember that you can style this
04:09 - mini-map in any way you'd like it works
04:12 - just like any other UI element you can
04:14 - add a mask in case you want say a
04:15 - circular mini-map you can easily add a
04:17 - border I'm just gonna right click go UI
04:20 - and add another image I'm gonna scale
04:22 - this up to be about 178 by 178
04:26 - then gonna place this behind the
04:28 - mini-map I'm gonna call this the
04:29 - mini-map border
04:31 - we then parent the mini-map to the
04:33 - mini-map border make sure to anchor the
04:35 - mini-map border to the upper right and
04:37 - let's have our mini-map snap to the
04:39 - center of our mini-map border so now
04:41 - we've created a border for our mini-map
04:43 - let's now have it follow our player of
04:45 - course the easiest way is to go ahead
04:47 - and just parent this to the player and
04:49 - as you can see this works just fine as
04:50 - long as it plays only rotating on the
04:52 - y-axis but this is not always the case
04:55 - so better more stable way is by creating
04:58 - a small script let's call this our
05:00 - mini-map script let's say create an ad
05:02 - and open it up in Visual Studio now
05:04 - first off we want a reference to our
05:06 - player will create a public transform
05:09 - player and then instead of the two
05:12 - default methods we'll create a void and
05:14 - now this is going to be a late update
05:16 - method we want to do this in late update
05:19 - because it's called after update and
05:21 - fixed update and so we'll only update
05:23 - the position of our mini-map after a
05:25 - player has moved in here we can create a
05:27 - new vector3 this is going to be the new
05:29 - position of our mini-map and we can set
05:32 - this equal to our players position of
05:34 - course we still want to be zoomed out on
05:36 - the Y so we can set new position dot Y
05:39 - to our current Y position we can then
05:42 - say transformed up position equals new
05:45 - position if we save this go into unity
05:48 - make sure to reference our player and
05:50 - hit play we can now see the mini-map
05:52 - actually follows around the player it
05:55 - doesn't rotate with the player but
05:57 - that's a very common thing for many mini
05:58 - maps if you wanted to also rotate with
06:00 - the player we simply go into our code
06:02 - add a few lines and we can now set
06:04 - transform dart rotation equal to
06:07 - quaternion Euler and here we feed it 90
06:12 - degrees on the X a player's rotation on
06:14 - the Y and here we want to make sure to
06:16 - use Euler angles dot Y and then zero on
06:19 - the Z let say this going to unity hit
06:22 - play and voila our camera is now also
06:24 - rotating with the player less of course
06:27 - a lot of fun stuff that you can do with
06:29 - your mini-map from here and out you can
06:31 - add icons you can add the ability to
06:33 - zoom in and out by simply adjusting the
06:35 - projection size of your camera and you
06:37 - can add lots of styling options and mass

in this video we'll make a mini map using rendered textures let's get right into it so as you can see I have this very simple scene with a player that we can move around but of course it's very much in need of a minimap but in order to create a minimap we need a second camera that can render our scene from a topdown view to do that let's deselect everything rightclick in our hierarchy and select camera let's then reset the transform on our camera and make sure that this sits at the same position as our player to do that we can select our player right click on his transform hit copy component we then select our camera right click and hit paste component values but we want to move our camera up so let's drag up on a y2 something like 20 let's also flip the camera so it's facing downwards we do this by rotating by 90 degrees on the X and first off we want to make sure that we have all the same settings as our previous camera because in most cases you probably want to render the seam in pretty much the same way to do that let's select our previous camera hit right click copy component it's like our new camera and paste those back in in my case this just changed the background to a

click go UI and add another image I'm gonna scale this up to be about 178 by 178 then gonna place this behind the minimap I'm gonna call this the minimap border we then parent the minimap to the minimap border make sure to anchor the minimap border to the upper right and let's have our minimap snap to the center of our minimap border so now we've created a border for our minimap let's now
