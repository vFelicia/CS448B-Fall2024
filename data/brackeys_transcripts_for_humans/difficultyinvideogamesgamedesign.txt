00:00 - you've probably had the feeling of a
00:01 - game being too easy while your friend
00:03 - was struggling or maybe the other way
00:05 - around this may even have led you to put
00:07 - the game down either because you were
00:09 - bored because of it being too easy or
00:11 - annoyed because of the high difficulty
00:15 - but why was the difficulty not right
00:18 - well in this video we're gonna find out
00:20 - but first this video is sponsored by
00:22 - Google for games each year the team
00:24 - shares their latest gaming announcements
00:26 - and this year was no exception Google
00:28 - has published more than 10 hours of
00:30 - content that covers everything from
00:31 - announcements to best practices and case
00:34 - studies that will help you successfully
00:35 - create launched and scale your game they
00:37 - also announced a new service called the
00:39 - game package registry for unity
00:41 - supporting all unity developers on
00:43 - version 2000 18.4 and later the registry
00:46 - gives developers a single point of
00:48 - access for all of Google's relevant
00:50 - api's right from within unity the
00:52 - registry launched with support for play
00:54 - billing library - Android app bundles
00:56 - play asset delivery Play instant and the
00:59 - firebase unity SDK with more API support
01:01 - on the way google has a ton of tools
01:04 - ready to support game developers so I
01:06 - definitely recommend you go check it out
01:07 - now by using the link in the description
01:09 - now before we can find out how to
01:10 - balance difficulty we first have to
01:12 - understand what influence difficulty has
01:15 - on the game well in game design
01:16 - difficulty is part of a bigger concept
01:18 - called game progression which describes
01:21 - how the player and game evolved together
01:23 - over time the ultimate goal with good
01:25 - game progression is for the player to
01:26 - reach and stay in a state of flow but
01:29 - what is flow well flow is a state of
01:32 - hyper focus and engagement some people
01:35 - refer to this as being in the zone you
01:37 - tune out everything except the task at
01:39 - hand and operate at peak performance
01:40 - time flies and you lose your sense of
01:43 - self flow is also not exclusive for
01:48 - games it happens in many things in life
01:50 - all it requires is a challenge that
01:52 - meets three requirements number one you
01:55 - must be performing a challenging
01:56 - activity that requires skill number two
01:58 - the activity must provide clear goals
02:00 - and feedback and number three the
02:02 - outcome must be uncertain but it must be
02:04 - able to be influenced by your actions so
02:07 - to get a better understanding of flow we
02:09 - can visualize it with a flow graph this
02:12 - is a chart that maps play
02:13 - skill on the x-axis and challenge on the
02:16 - y-axis at the start of the game the
02:17 - player has little to no skill and
02:19 - understanding of the game mechanics as
02:21 - the player progresses however the player
02:24 - skill increases and with that an
02:25 - increase in challenge should follow if
02:28 - the challenge doesn't increase enough
02:29 - the player becomes bored and if it
02:31 - increases too quickly the player will
02:33 - get frustrated both cases result in the
02:35 - player getting disinterested in the game
02:37 - and leaving so the goal is to keep
02:39 - everything nicely balanced between these
02:41 - two scenarios but don't think of it like
02:43 - you have to constantly stay on the line
02:46 - think of it more like a channel that
02:48 - allows for some wiggle room because just
02:51 - hitting players with one increasingly
02:52 - difficult challenge after the other is
02:54 - exhausting instead we need to mix things
02:56 - up and give the player some breathing
02:58 - room between challenges and that's all
03:00 - fine and dandy but how can we adjust our
03:02 - difficulty so that we keep the player in
03:04 - the flow Channel and guide them back if
03:06 - they fall out well when talking about
03:09 - difficulty it is important to note that
03:11 - there is no fixed difficulty by that I
03:13 - mean that different players can have
03:15 - vastly different experiences at the same
03:17 - difficulty setting in other words
03:19 - difficulty is relative instead we will
03:23 - refer to difficulty as the perceived
03:25 - difficulty of the player meaning how the
03:27 - player experiences the difficulty level
03:29 - and perceived difficulty can actually be
03:32 - split up into four components the player
03:35 - power level which refers to the players
03:37 - artificial strengths such as stats
03:39 - weapons and abilities give the player
03:42 - extra health and they will stay alive
03:43 - longer give them better weaponry and
03:45 - they will do more damage the player
03:47 - skill level refers to the player's
03:49 - physical and mental strengths how good
03:51 - the player is at the game this contains
03:54 - stuff like game knowledge and raw skill
03:56 - knowing all this smoke spots and
03:58 - call-outs in counter-strike might help
04:00 - you out a lot but in a direct gunfight
04:02 - the player with the better aim aka
04:04 - higher raw skill will probably win if
04:07 - you throw a new player into the last
04:08 - boss fight in a game
04:09 - they'll probably fail because of their
04:11 - lack of game knowledge even with endgame
04:13 - gear and abilities and justice with the
04:16 - player the enemy power level refers to
04:18 - the enemy's power whether being stats
04:20 - and weapons or the actual number of
04:22 - enemies this is a great way to quickly
04:24 - amp up the difficulty without much extra
04:26 - work on
04:26 - dev site but be careful though just
04:30 - buffing the stats of enemies or spawning
04:31 - more might be easy but not necessarily
04:34 - very engaging to the player and finally
04:40 - the enemy's skill level refers to the
04:42 - AIS intelligence their navigation skills
04:46 - decision-making skills and weaponry
04:48 - skills such as aimed precision fighting
04:51 - smarter enemies is often way more
04:53 - rewarding than just shooting the same
04:54 - guy twice as many times thankfully SD
04:57 - game designer we can control many of
04:59 - these variables but the players skill
05:01 - level is out of our hands
05:03 - at least the raw skill however how fast
05:06 - the player learns the mechanics of the
05:07 - game can actually be influenced by our
05:09 - game design but that's for another video
05:11 - so now we know that as a game designer
05:13 - we can control three of the variables in
05:16 - the difficult equation player power
05:18 - enemy power and enemy skill but how do
05:21 - we scale these variables well that
05:23 - completely depends on the game so let's
05:26 - look to some other games for examples in
05:28 - RPG games or similar genres the players
05:31 - power his stats and abilities naturally
05:33 - increase over time as he levels up and
05:35 - games new gear but sometimes the natural
05:38 - power gain is not enough and some
05:40 - players might get stuck at certain
05:42 - bosses or challenges a way to counteract
05:45 - this is by giving players the ability to
05:46 - replay sections to get more HP buy the
05:49 - items new weapons and abilities this way
05:52 - a player that's behind in skill is still
05:54 - able to catch up by getting more power
05:56 - be careful with this though not all
05:58 - players like to grind the same content
05:59 - over and over again a way to make the
06:02 - grind less obvious is to use procedural
06:04 - generation for example randomly
06:05 - generated dungeons and encounters or if
06:08 - you have the resources you can create
06:09 - entire side quests chains with original
06:12 - content another way of adjusting player
06:14 - power is with buffs and debuffs for
06:17 - example take a look at path of Exile
06:19 - which has an endgame system code the
06:21 - Atlas here players craft their own maps
06:24 - with modifiers these modifiers can
06:26 - increase the amount of enemies and loot
06:28 - dropped in the map but they can also
06:30 - give players debuffs such as longer
06:32 - cooldowns or no health regeneration this
06:34 - is a very cool system because it allows
06:36 - the players to challenge themselves
06:37 - without getting better
06:39 - it's also the player is choosing the
06:41 - challenge it's not the system randomly
06:44 - interfering with the players experience
06:45 - in terms of enemies scaling the power is
06:48 - the easiest and most common approach
06:50 - going back to the path of exile example
06:52 - from before when customizing your map
06:54 - enemies can also get modifiers such as
06:57 - more health extra damage higher crit
06:59 - chance and so on I want to point out
07:01 - that I don't think adjusting enemy power
07:03 - is a no-go this part is just as
07:05 - important as enemy skill and almost
07:07 - mandatory for many games imagine playing
07:09 - World of Warcraft without buffing enemy
07:11 - numbers it would look something like
07:13 - this yeah not very exciting enemy power
07:17 - is definitely needed just apply it with
07:19 - caution now enemies skill though is a
07:22 - bit more tricky how do we make the enemy
07:24 - appear smarter or dumber well in games
07:27 - such as Diablo 3 enemies can have traits
07:30 - which have a great impact on gameplay
07:32 - the amount of traits enemies can have
07:35 - increases with the difficulty at higher
07:37 - levels an enemy can have up to four
07:39 - traits adding cool new mechanics to each
07:41 - fight such as illusion clones you have
07:43 - to kill and frost orbs or arcane beams
07:46 - you have to avoid new mechanics like
07:48 - these will spice up the gameplay whilst
07:50 - making it harder for the player another
07:52 - example is the way a eye is handled in
07:54 - Starcraft 2 actions per a minute or a
07:57 - p.m. is a number showing how active a
07:59 - player is a player with a higher APM is
08:02 - often doing more stuff at the same time
08:04 - managing units assigning tasks for
08:06 - workers upgrading stuff and so on APM is
08:10 - even getting tracked in professional
08:11 - matches well a computers of course way
08:14 - faster than a human at performing
08:16 - actions in an RTS game because of this
08:19 - most RTS a eyes have a cap on APM to
08:22 - prevent it from completely destroying
08:24 - every human opponent APM in this case is
08:27 - a great way to scale the difficulty in
08:29 - games with a similar AI now this of
08:32 - course many more ways of scaling the
08:33 - different aspects of difficulty in your
08:35 - game we're just scratching the surface
08:37 - here the most important thing is that
08:39 - you think actively about difficulty when
08:42 - designing your game and I really
08:43 - encourage you to get creative with it
08:45 - but finding the right difficulty balance
08:47 - is one thing we still need to figure out
08:50 - how we allow the player to influence the
08:52 - difficulty
08:53 - should the player be able to just choose
08:54 - a difficulty or should the difficulty
08:57 - change on its own
08:58 - well static difficulty settings is the
09:01 - most basic and probably most common way
09:03 - of addressing the difficulty problem the
09:05 - game has two or more difficulty settings
09:07 - that the player can choose between
09:08 - depending on their skill and preference
09:10 - if the player wants to lean back and
09:12 - steamroll through the game they can
09:14 - choose a difficulty that's lower than
09:15 - their skill level and if the player
09:17 - wants a challenge they can choose a
09:19 - harder setting this leaves the choice up
09:21 - to the player which is fine for some
09:23 - games but what if you want every player
09:25 - to have roughly the same experience when
09:27 - talking about difficulty and what if the
09:30 - player is unsure about their own skill
09:32 - level well with dynamic difficulty
09:34 - adjustment or DDA you analyze the
09:37 - player's performance during gameplay and
09:39 - adjust accordingly now this is something
09:41 - that you can get really nerdy with your
09:44 - system could look at things like how
09:46 - much health did the player loose in the
09:48 - section how fast was the player or how
09:50 - precise was their aim the crash
09:52 - bandicoot games for example make use of
09:54 - DDA to slow down obstacles and give
09:57 - extra hit points according to the
09:58 - players number of deaths this however
10:00 - can be dangerous because we're
10:03 - negatively affecting the player for
10:04 - being good to counteract the difficult
10:07 - to increase we can introduce some sort
10:09 - of reward for getting faced with these
10:11 - hearty enemies DDA also requires a lot
10:14 - of work to develop and fine-tune you
10:16 - have to make sure the change is subtle
10:17 - if players start to realize that their
10:19 - performance has a great impact on the
10:21 - game's difficulty some might try to
10:23 - exploit the system instead you could
10:25 - also go for some sort of hybrid approach
10:27 - Resident Evil 4 for example employed a
10:30 - system called the difficulty scale this
10:32 - system would grade the players
10:34 - performance on a scale from one to ten
10:36 - this is like the difficulty would lock
10:37 - players to a specific grade but with a
10:40 - margin for example on Normal difficulty
10:42 - you start at scale for can move down to
10:45 - two if doing poorly or up to seven if
10:47 - doing well the grades between
10:49 - difficulties can overlap so a player
10:51 - doing well on easy can potentially play
10:53 - at the same difficulty scale that's one
10:55 - doing poorly on normal this is a great
10:58 - approach because we're still adjusting
10:59 - the difficulty based on the player's
11:01 - performance but the player is able to
11:02 - choose if they want the experience to be
11:04 - harder or easier overall
11:06 - that's pretty much all we have time for
11:08 - in this video now we've mostly been
11:11 - focusing on single player or co-op games
11:14 - game difficulty in competitive
11:16 - multiplayer games are quite different in
11:18 - multiplayer games perceive difficulty is
11:20 - determined by things like matchmaking
11:22 - balancing and complexity of the
11:24 - mechanics so throw a comment down below
11:26 - if you want to see a video on that also
11:29 - if you want to take deeper into the
11:30 - theory of flow and difficulty will of
11:32 - course have some links to where you can

Cleaned transcript:

you've probably had the feeling of a game being too easy while your friend was struggling or maybe the other way around this may even have led you to put the game down either because you were bored because of it being too easy or annoyed because of the high difficulty but why was the difficulty not right well in this video we're gonna find out but first this video is sponsored by Google for games each year the team shares their latest gaming announcements and this year was no exception Google has published more than 10 hours of content that covers everything from announcements to best practices and case studies that will help you successfully create launched and scale your game they also announced a new service called the game package registry for unity supporting all unity developers on version 2000 18.4 and later the registry gives developers a single point of access for all of Google's relevant api's right from within unity the registry launched with support for play billing library Android app bundles play asset delivery Play instant and the firebase unity SDK with more API support on the way google has a ton of tools ready to support game developers so I definitely recommend you go check it out now by using the link in the description now before we can find out how to balance difficulty we first have to understand what influence difficulty has on the game well in game design difficulty is part of a bigger concept called game progression which describes how the player and game evolved together over time the ultimate goal with good game progression is for the player to reach and stay in a state of flow but what is flow well flow is a state of hyper focus and engagement some people refer to this as being in the zone you tune out everything except the task at hand and operate at peak performance time flies and you lose your sense of self flow is also not exclusive for games it happens in many things in life all it requires is a challenge that meets three requirements number one you must be performing a challenging activity that requires skill number two the activity must provide clear goals and feedback and number three the outcome must be uncertain but it must be able to be influenced by your actions so to get a better understanding of flow we can visualize it with a flow graph this is a chart that maps play skill on the xaxis and challenge on the yaxis at the start of the game the player has little to no skill and understanding of the game mechanics as the player progresses however the player skill increases and with that an increase in challenge should follow if the challenge doesn't increase enough the player becomes bored and if it increases too quickly the player will get frustrated both cases result in the player getting disinterested in the game and leaving so the goal is to keep everything nicely balanced between these two scenarios but don't think of it like you have to constantly stay on the line think of it more like a channel that allows for some wiggle room because just hitting players with one increasingly difficult challenge after the other is exhausting instead we need to mix things up and give the player some breathing room between challenges and that's all fine and dandy but how can we adjust our difficulty so that we keep the player in the flow Channel and guide them back if they fall out well when talking about difficulty it is important to note that there is no fixed difficulty by that I mean that different players can have vastly different experiences at the same difficulty setting

like game knowledge and raw skill knowing all this smoke spots and callouts in counterstrike might help you out a lot but in a direct gunfight the player with the better aim aka higher raw skill will
