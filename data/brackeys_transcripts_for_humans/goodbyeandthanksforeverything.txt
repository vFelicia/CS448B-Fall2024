00:00 - hello welcome to the first tutorial done
00:02 - by brackie's hello everyone hello
00:04 - everyone hello everyone hello everyone
00:06 - hello everyone and welcome to this video
00:07 - hello everyone everyone it's me
00:10 - hello everyone happy new year yo dawg
00:12 - hello everyone hello everyone hello
00:13 - everyone hey everyone hello one hello
00:16 - everyone
00:17 - as you can probably guess from the title
00:18 - of this video we have some news that we
00:20 - would like to share with you
00:22 - this is pretty crazy so i'm just gonna
00:24 - come right out and say it
00:26 - this is our last video yeah
00:29 - i know that sounds really dramatic and
00:31 - you probably have a bunch of questions
00:34 - so i'm going to do my best to answer
00:36 - them let's start with the
00:37 - why first of all i just want to be very
00:40 - clear that this decision does not come
00:42 - from a negative place
00:43 - nothing in particular has prompted us to
00:45 - stop no one is mad at anyone or anything
00:47 - like that
00:48 - the reason why is simply that it's time
00:50 - for us to move on to new things
00:52 - personally i've been making youtube
00:54 - videos on game development for
00:56 - almost eight years now that's a long
00:58 - time
00:59 - i was 12 when i first picked up unity
01:01 - and 15 when i started the channel
01:03 - so i spent a lot of my younger years
01:05 - trying to make game development more
01:07 - accessible and it's been an incredible
01:10 - experience
01:11 - of course making the videos themselves
01:13 - getting to teach game development to an
01:15 - audience and watching that audience grow
01:17 - but also running the channel with good
01:19 - friends moving into an
01:20 - office traveling to events and meeting
01:23 - developers from all over the world
01:25 - but of course all good things must come
01:27 - to an end
01:28 - and while i'm in love with game
01:29 - development and it's been amazing
01:31 - creating all this content over the years
01:33 - i just checked we've made like 460
01:36 - videos
01:38 - it's time to take a step back and see
01:40 - what other fun stuff there is to try
01:42 - so what does that mean for the future
01:45 - well personally i'm going to be taking a
01:46 - break from the game development space
01:48 - maybe pursue some personal projects or
01:50 - learn some new skills
01:52 - maybe get a bit more time for family for
01:54 - brankies this means that we will no
01:56 - longer be putting out new content
01:58 - will there ever be new videos again who
02:00 - knows but we don't have anything planned
02:02 - but i want to make it very clear that
02:04 - we'll be keeping everything up
02:06 - all of our videos will still be
02:07 - available to watch we've been working on
02:09 - putting subtitles on a lot of them as
02:11 - well
02:11 - the discord server and forum will also
02:13 - remain active the same goes for line of
02:16 - code
02:16 - and dev assets and all of our other
02:18 - downloadable content
02:19 - the only thing that we'll be taking down
02:21 - is the patreon page
02:23 - so a huge thank you to everyone who've
02:25 - supported over the years
02:26 - brackies wouldn't have been possible
02:28 - without you and i've mentioned a few
02:30 - things that made this experience
02:32 - creating brachies amazing
02:34 - but for me the most important thing is
02:36 - the incredible community that has
02:38 - evolved around it
02:39 - it's truly been incredible watching a
02:41 - community come to life in this way
02:43 - and most importantly that it's become
02:45 - such a supportive
02:47 - welcoming nice and just fun place to be
02:49 - for game developers of all different
02:51 - kinds
02:52 - and while it's time for us to move on
02:54 - the last thing that i want
02:55 - is for it to have any impact on the
02:57 - community because of that the discord
02:59 - server will of course remain
03:00 - active and fully functional and the
03:02 - discord staff will continue
03:04 - running it on a day-to-day basis i'll
03:06 - also be checking in once in a while to
03:07 - make sure that everything is running
03:09 - smoothly and to say hi
03:10 - but honestly the discord staff have
03:12 - already been running it independently
03:14 - for a long time now
03:16 - they're really much better at it than i
03:17 - am which is also why we're renaming the
03:20 - server to brackey's community
03:22 - it wouldn't exist without you only seems
03:24 - fair you get some of the credit
03:26 - we'll also continue to host events like
03:28 - the brackey's game jam i'll of course
03:30 - make sure to post about it when the next
03:31 - event
03:32 - is coming up i recommend you follow us
03:33 - at bracket suite on twitter for those
03:35 - kinds of announcements
03:37 - and i'll also make a written youtube
03:38 - post once in a while so i recommend you
03:40 - stay subscribed to get notified of that
