00:00 - so we've previously talked about how
00:01 - amazing tell maps are for quickly making
00:03 - 2d levels in unity
00:05 - well of course talents are only useful
00:06 - if you want everything to be on a fixed
00:08 - grid now sprite shapes on the other hand
00:10 - are set up in a very similar way to tile
00:12 - maps but instead of placing tiles on a
00:14 - grid the sprites will stretch and tile
00:16 - in order to follow a path this makes it
00:19 - super easy to create curves and more
00:21 - organic feeling objects as of making
00:23 - this video sprite shape is still in
00:24 - preview so features are still being
00:26 - moved around and added but it's
00:28 - definitely usable so let's have a look
00:30 - at how to start using it but first this
00:32 - video is sponsored by a skill share
00:33 - skill shares an online learning
00:34 - community with more than 23,000 quality
00:37 - classes on game development tech and
00:39 - more if for example you want to make
00:41 - your own card game in unity I really
00:43 - recommend you check out this awesome
00:44 - course on developing trading card battle
00:46 - systems this guide is made by vladimir
00:48 - imagine and teaches your everything from
00:50 - making your own card faces to
00:52 - implementing your cards in battle let's
00:54 - go see our membership gives you
00:55 - unlimited access to all classes for less
00:57 - than $10 a month so to get started
00:59 - simply click the link in the description
01:01 - and the first 500 people will receive
01:02 - their first two months for free now to
01:05 - take advantage of sprite shape we of
01:06 - course need some nice sprites that are
01:08 - set up in the right way these are the
01:10 - sprites that I will be using in this
01:11 - video you can download them using the
01:13 - link in the description they are made by
01:15 - the awesome mod mod who has a YouTube
01:17 - channel on creating beautiful pixel art
01:19 - so if you want to learn how to create
01:20 - your own pixel out sprites definitely
01:22 - check that out
01:23 - in fact he's made a video on creating
01:24 - this exact sprite sheet alright let's
01:26 - get started so the first thing that we
01:28 - need to do is of course to install
01:30 - sprite shape and it's currently
01:31 - available in a preview version using the
01:33 - package manager so let's go window and
01:35 - open up the package manager let's go
01:37 - under all and find the 2d sprite shape
01:40 - package and here we instantly hit
01:42 - install and that is all we need to do we
01:44 - can now use sprite shape in our project
01:46 - now I've already gone ahead and imported
01:48 - the sprites that we're going to be using
01:50 - in this video I've made sure to select
01:52 - all of them and set the pixels per unit
01:54 - to 16 the folder mode to point because
01:56 - we're using pixel art and I've also
01:58 - removed any kind of compression and the
02:00 - first type of sprite shape that we're
02:01 - going to be creating is an open-ended
02:03 - shape now open-ended shapes are great
02:05 - for stuff like flat platforms and
02:08 - creating these are super simple if I
02:10 - just take my platform sprite here you
02:12 - can see that it's just one
02:13 - unified spread there's no need to split
02:16 - it up into individual tiles using this
02:18 - system and I'll show you why in a sec
02:20 - but for now let's start by creating a
02:22 - sprite shape profile and we do this
02:24 - inside of the project window
02:26 - let's it create go under sprite shape
02:28 - profile let's start by creating a strip
02:30 - profile we'll name this profile
02:31 - something like flat platform and now we
02:34 - can see a bunch of different settings in
02:35 - our inspector here but when creating an
02:37 - open-ended shape there's not a lot of
02:39 - this that we need to adjust in fact for
02:41 - now we can just get away with adding our
02:43 - sprite so that's hit the plus sign under
02:45 - sprites and it's dragging all platform
02:47 - and we see this bright now gets
02:49 - displayed here now with this profile
02:51 - selected we can go to the hierarchy and
02:52 - hit create 2d object sprite shape and
02:55 - we've now created a sprite shape object
02:58 - based on a flat platform profile you can
03:00 - always change the profile over here and
03:02 - what this means is that we're actually
03:04 - ready to start editing our path to do
03:06 - this we go to the right and hit edit
03:08 - spline you can see that we now have
03:10 - these two points that we can drag out in
03:12 - any way that we'd like to you also
03:14 - notice that as soon as we do that our
03:15 - platform starts tiling and it doesn't do
03:18 - so in a very pretty way it simply
03:20 - repeats the entire platform one after
03:22 - another and that's not really what we
03:24 - want instead we would like to see that
03:26 - we have the end of the platform here
03:28 - then it simply repeats the middle part
03:30 - and then we have another end of the
03:32 - platform at the end to set this up we
03:34 - simply stop editing the spline we go
03:37 - select all platform sprite and let's
03:39 - open up the sprite editor and in here we
03:41 - can use the sprite editor to define the
03:43 - ends of our platform as well as the
03:45 - middle part and doing this is super easy
03:47 - we simply adjust the left and right side
03:50 - of our border so I'm gonna set this to
03:52 - something like 5 down here and I'm gonna
03:54 - do the same thing with the right side
03:56 - and now we can see that we've separated
03:57 - the ends of our platform from the center
04:00 - if we apply this and go back into unity
04:03 - we can see that immediately our platform
04:05 - tiles really nicely and if we go in and
04:08 - edit the spreadsheet ghin we can add
04:10 - more points if we simply press on the
04:12 - middle here and drag out we've now added
04:14 - a sharp corner point we can see that
04:16 - here the point mode is currently a sharp
04:18 - point where we go in a straight line
04:20 - from point to point we can also edit
04:22 - this to change it into a curve and here
04:25 - we can adjust the tangents to make it
04:26 - much smooth
04:27 - and nicer and if you don't want the
04:29 - attendance to be mirrored we can choose
04:31 - the last mode here where we can adjust
04:33 - the smoothness of each side individually
04:35 - but I simply want a smooth curve here so
04:37 - I'm gonna select that and let me just
04:39 - draw out a quick shape there we go so
04:42 - you can really see how easy it is to
04:44 - create your own shapes inside of the
04:45 - editor now we can stop editing this
04:47 - spine and at this point we can use it
04:49 - like any other object we can move it
04:50 - around we can scale it and rotate it
04:53 - however of course one thing that we
04:55 - probably want to do is add a Collider to
04:58 - our platform and doing this is actually
05:00 - super simple we simply hit add component
05:02 - and search for edge Collider 2d and then
05:05 - inside of our sprite shape controller we
05:07 - can go under Collider and select update
05:09 - Collider and right away we can see that
05:11 - our green line snaps right into place
05:13 - however of course it's currently in the
05:15 - center of our platform and we want to be
05:17 - able to stand on top of it so to change
05:19 - this we can adjust the offset of our
05:22 - Collider I'm gonna bump this up and that
05:24 - actually looks pretty decent we can also
05:25 - change the corner type to something like
05:27 - round and there we go
05:29 - we now have a Collider for a platform in
05:31 - fact if we were to just add some kind of
05:33 - rigid body into a scene I've gone it and
05:35 - created a bowl here that has the circle
05:37 - Collider supposed a rigidbody and hit
05:39 - play we can see that it works just fine
05:42 - awesome so that is how you can use
05:44 - open-ended shapes to create simple flat
05:46 - platforms but what if we wanted to
05:48 - create closed-ended objects that doesn't
05:51 - just allow us to create lines but
05:52 - actually closed-ended shapes I mean this
05:55 - is fine for platforms but what if we
05:57 - wanted to create larger ground elements
05:59 - now to do this we need to create another
06:01 - profile so inside of our project we'll
06:03 - go create sprite shape profile and this
06:05 - time I want to start with an empty
06:07 - profile let's name it something like
06:09 - ground and you can see that we get all
06:12 - of these same settings however this time
06:14 - we don't have a predefined range now
06:16 - range is basically just allow us to
06:18 - define what sprites we want to show when
06:21 - facing in what direction and for our
06:23 - first profile here we can see that we
06:25 - just have one large range that goes
06:27 - around in the entire circle so we always
06:30 - show the same sprite however for our
06:32 - ground we probably want to have some
06:34 - grass at the top some dirt on the sides
06:36 - some different kind of dirt at the
06:38 - bottom so to do this we actually need to
06:40 - create
06:41 - or ranges in order to create a range we
06:43 - of course hit create range and we then
06:45 - choose these start and end points of our
06:47 - range I'm gonna start this off at 45 and
06:50 - end it at negative 4 to 5 so this makes
06:53 - a 90 degree range I'm going to create
06:55 - another 90 degree range right after that
06:57 - simply by pressing that goes from
06:59 - negative 45 to negative 135 I'm gonna
07:02 - keep pressing here just controlling the
07:05 - numbers to make sure they are ok now we
07:06 - can see that we've created for different
07:08 - ranges and as we adjust this Margaret
07:10 - and go around we can add sprites for
07:12 - each one of them so at the top here I'm
07:14 - going to add a symbol top sprite and
07:15 - this is just some grass and some dirt
07:17 - I'm gonna be using tile 2 for this and
07:20 - as you can see that looks just fine then
07:22 - we get to the right-hand side here I
07:24 - want to be using another sprite so I'm
07:25 - gonna hit + and this is where sprite
07:27 - shape is a bit different than normal
07:29 - towel Maps because my instinct
07:31 - originally was to create a sprite that
07:33 - faced to the right but we actually don't
07:36 - want to do that for sprite shapes
07:38 - instead we actually still want to create
07:39 - a sprite that faces upwards as you can
07:41 - see here that's what we've done and the
07:44 - reason for this is that we don't need to
07:46 - rotate it
07:46 - sprite shape is going to rotate it for
07:48 - us in fact we can see that happening in
07:51 - this wheel spread shape is just
07:52 - constantly rotating our sprite so for
07:55 - the right one here we simply need to
07:56 - choose Tao 7 and we see now that it
07:59 - looks great for the bottom tile we're
08:01 - going to add another one and this is
08:02 - going to be tile 10 again this isn't
08:04 - made to point downwards it still points
08:06 - upwards but it looks different and
08:08 - finally for the left-hand side here I'm
08:10 - going to add in tile 5 so now we can see
08:13 - that this bright will change accordingly
08:14 - as we go round and just to show you this
08:17 - in action let's try and create a sprite
08:19 - shape object based on this profile
08:20 - that's selected let's go to hierarchy
08:23 - and hit create let's like 2d object and
08:25 - sprite shape and you'll notice that it
08:27 - detects that we have multiple sprites in
08:29 - here and therefore it's gone ahead and
08:31 - disabled open-ended but if it hasn't
08:34 - done so you can always make sure to
08:35 - check that box and right away we can see
08:37 - the effect of our changes if we go in
08:40 - and edit the spline here no matter what
08:42 - we do it's always going to display the
08:44 - appropriate sprite depending on which
08:46 - direction the sprite is facing pretty
08:48 - cool of course there's still some stuff
08:50 - lacking mainly we don't have any corners
08:52 - and the inside of our shape is comes
08:55 - dmt to fix this let's select our ground
08:57 - profile and let's start by adding a fill
09:00 - of course we've created a tile for this
09:01 - as well this is tile sex however we can
09:04 - see right away that looks pretty weird
09:06 - the reason for that is that we need to
09:08 - make sure to select the tile that we
09:09 - want to use as fill and set the wrap
09:12 - mode to repeat if we apply that it
09:14 - already looks better
09:16 - however it's currently tiling way too
09:17 - closely let's go in here and set the
09:19 - pixels per unit to 16 here as well and
09:22 - now we can see that we have a nice fill
09:24 - on our tile the last thing that we need
09:25 - to do is add in corners and these are
09:27 - simply defined as separate sprites so
09:29 - for the outer top left corner I'm going
09:32 - to select tile one here for the hourly
09:34 - top right corner I'm gonna select aisle
09:35 - 3 for the bottom left corner I'm gonna
09:37 - select our 9 and 4 bottom right I'm
09:40 - gonna select aisle 11 now these are
09:42 - currently not showing up in our sprite
09:44 - shape and this is one of those things
09:46 - that confused me at first but that's
09:48 - because we have the opportunity to go in
09:50 - and define what points we want to act as
09:52 - corners so if we edit the spine here we
09:55 - can select one of the points and now we
09:57 - get to choose what to do with the corner
09:59 - we neither choose disabled or automatic
10:02 - I can see as soon as we choose automatic
10:04 - the cornea snaps right into place let's
10:06 - do this for all of the points and voila
10:09 - we now have a really nice-looking ground
10:12 - element so let's stop editing the spline
10:14 - here let's move up our objects so we can
10:16 - see everything clearly and there you go
10:18 - that's my introduction to sprite shapes
10:20 - from here it's up to you to create your
10:21 - own custom sprites to play around with
10:22 - and just have fun shaping your own
10:24 - Devils it's a really creative and fun
10:26 - tool to use I do also think that there
10:29 - is a lot of stuff that could be improved
10:30 - here I think the UI is a bit cluttered I
10:33 - think some of the ways that you set up
10:34 - your profiles is a bit overly
10:36 - complicated and generally could just use
10:38 - a tiny bit of tidying up but it is still
10:41 - in preview so we have to cut the
10:43 - developers some slack and it is already
10:44 - a really great tool in fact there's
10:46 - still stuff that you can do with this
10:48 - that I haven't shown you for example you
10:49 - can easily add variations if you don't
10:51 - want to just be tiling the same tile
10:53 - over and over and that's actually also
10:55 - an API you can use to script your own
10:57 - custom behavior if you want to learn
10:59 - more about those things I'll of course
11:00 - have a link in the description awesome
11:02 - so that's pretty much it for this video

Cleaned transcript:

so we've previously talked about how amazing tell maps are for quickly making 2d levels in unity well of course talents are only useful if you want everything to be on a fixed grid now sprite shapes on the other hand are set up in a very similar way to tile maps but instead of placing tiles on a grid the sprites will stretch and tile in order to follow a path this makes it super easy to create curves and more organic feeling objects as of making this video sprite shape is still in preview so features are still being moved around and added but it's definitely usable so let's have a look at how to start using it but first this video is sponsored by a skill share skill shares an online learning community with more than 23,000 quality classes on game development tech and more if for example you want to make your own card game in unity I really recommend you check out this awesome course on developing trading card battle systems this guide is made by vladimir imagine and teaches your everything from making your own card faces to implementing your cards in battle let's go see our membership gives you unlimited access to all classes for less than $10 a month so to get started simply click the link in the description and the first 500 people will receive their first two months for free now to take advantage of sprite shape we of course need some nice sprites that are set up in the right way these are the sprites that I will be using in this video you can download them using the link in the description they are made by the awesome mod mod who has a YouTube channel on creating beautiful pixel art so if you want to learn how to create your own pixel out sprites definitely check that out in fact he's made a video on creating this exact sprite sheet alright let's get started so the first thing that we need to do is of course to install sprite shape and it's currently available in a preview version using the package manager so let's go window and open up the package manager let's go under all and find the 2d sprite shape package and here we instantly hit install and that is all we need to do we can now use sprite shape in our project now I've already gone ahead and imported the sprites that we're going to be using in this video I've made sure to select all of them and set the pixels per unit to 16 the folder mode to point because we're using pixel art and I've also removed any kind of compression and the first type of sprite shape that we're going to be creating is an openended shape now openended shapes are great for stuff like flat platforms and creating these are super simple if I just take my platform sprite here you can see that it's just one unified spread there's no need to split it up into individual tiles using this system and I'll show you why in a sec but for now let's start by creating a sprite shape profile and we do this inside of the project window let's it create go under sprite shape profile let's start by creating a strip profile we'll name this profile something like flat platform and now we can see a bunch of different settings in our inspector here but when creating an openended shape there's not a lot of this that we need to adjust in fact for now we can just get away with adding our sprite so that's hit the plus sign under sprites and it's dragging all platform and we see this bright now gets displayed here now with this profile selected we can go to the hierarchy and hit create 2d object sprite shape and we've now created a sprite shape object based on a flat platform profile you can always change the profile over here and what this means is that we're actually ready to start editing our path to do this we go to the right and hit edit spline you can see that we now have these two points that we can drag out in any way that we'd like to you also notice that as soon as we do that our platform starts tiling and it doesn't do so in a very pretty way it simply repeats the entire platform one after another and that's not really what we want instead we would like to see that we have the end of the platform here then it simply repeats the middle part and then we have another end of the platform at the end to set this up we simply stop editing the spline we go select all platform sprite and let's open up the sprite editor and in here we can use the sprite editor to define the ends of our platform as well as the middle part and doing this is super easy we simply adjust the left and right side of our border so I'm gonna set this to something like 5 down here and I'm gonna do the same thing with the right side and now we can see that we've separated the ends of our platform from the center if we apply this and go back into unity we can see that immediately our platform tiles really nicely and if we go in and edit the spreadsheet ghin we can add more points if we simply press on the middle here and drag out we've now added a sharp corner point we can see that here the point mode is currently a sharp point where we go in a straight line from point to point we can also edit this to change it into a curve and here we can adjust the tangents to make it much smooth and nicer and if you don't want the attendance to be mirrored we can choose the last mode here where we can adjust the smoothness of each side individually but I simply want a smooth curve here so I'm gonna select that and let me just draw out a quick shape there we go so you can really see how easy it is to create your own shapes inside of the editor now we can stop editing this spine and at this point we can use it like any other object we can move it around we can scale it and rotate it however of course one thing that we probably want to do is add a Collider to our platform and doing this is actually super simple we simply hit add component and search for edge Collider 2d and then inside of our sprite shape controller we can go under Collider and select update Collider and right away we can see that our green line snaps right into place however of course it's currently in the center of our platform and we want to be able to stand on top of it so to change this we can adjust the offset of our Collider I'm gonna bump this up and that actually looks pretty decent we can also change the corner type to something like round and there we go we now have a Collider for a platform in fact if we were to just add some kind of rigid body into a scene I've gone it and created a bowl here that has the circle Collider supposed a rigidbody and hit play we can see that it works just fine awesome so that is how you can use openended shapes to create simple flat platforms but what if we wanted to create closedended objects that doesn't just allow us to create lines but actually closedended shapes I mean this is fine for platforms but what if we wanted to create larger ground elements now to do this we need to create another profile so inside of our project we'll go create sprite shape profile and this time I want to start with an empty profile let's name it something like ground and you can see that we get all of these same settings however this time we don't have a predefined range now range is basically just allow us to define what sprites we want to show when facing in what direction and for our first profile here we can see that we just have one large range that goes around in the entire circle so we always show the same sprite however for our ground we probably want to have some grass at the top some dirt on the sides some different kind of dirt at the bottom so to do this we actually need to create or ranges in order to create a range we of course hit create range and we then choose these start and end points of our range I'm gonna start this off at 45 and end it at negative 4 to 5 so this makes a 90 degree range I'm going to create another 90 degree range right after that simply by pressing that goes from negative 45 to negative 135 I'm gonna keep pressing here just controlling the numbers to make sure they are ok now we can see that we've created for different ranges and as we adjust this Margaret and go around we can add sprites for each one of them so at the top here I'm going to add a symbol top sprite and this is just some grass and some dirt I'm gonna be using tile 2 for this and as you can see that looks just fine then we get to the righthand side here I want to be using another sprite so I'm gonna hit + and this is where sprite shape is a bit different than normal towel Maps because my instinct originally was to create a sprite that faced to the right but we actually don't want to do that for sprite shapes instead we actually still want to create a sprite that faces upwards as you can see here that's what we've done and the reason for this is that we don't need to rotate it sprite shape is going to rotate it for us in fact we can see that happening in this wheel spread shape is just constantly rotating our sprite so for the right one here we simply need to choose Tao 7 and we see now that it looks great for the bottom tile we're going to add another one and this is going to be tile 10 again this isn't made to point downwards it still points upwards but it looks different and finally for the lefthand side here I'm going to add in tile 5 so now we can see that this bright will change accordingly as we go round and just to show you this in action let's try and create a sprite shape object based on this profile that's selected let's go to hierarchy and hit create let's like 2d object and sprite shape and you'll notice that it detects that we have multiple sprites in here and therefore it's gone ahead and disabled openended but if it hasn't done so you can always make sure to check that box and right away we can see the effect of our changes if we go in and edit the spline here no matter what we do it's always going to display the appropriate sprite depending on which direction the sprite is facing pretty cool of course there's still some stuff lacking mainly we don't have any corners and the inside of our shape is comes dmt to fix this let's select our ground profile and let's start by adding a fill of course we've created a tile for this as well this is tile sex however we can see right away that looks pretty weird the reason for that is that we need to make sure to select the tile that we want to use as fill and set the wrap mode to repeat if we apply that it already looks better however it's currently tiling way too closely let's go in here and set the pixels per unit to 16 here as well and now we can see that we have a nice fill on our tile the last thing that we need to do is add in corners and these are simply defined as separate sprites so for the outer top left corner I'm going to select tile one here for the hourly top right corner I'm gonna select aisle 3 for the bottom left corner I'm gonna select our 9 and 4 bottom right I'm gonna select aisle 11 now these are currently not showing up in our sprite shape and this is one of those things that confused me at first but that's because we have the opportunity to go in and define what points we want to act as corners so if we edit the spine here we can select one of the points and now we get to choose what to do with the corner we neither choose disabled or automatic I can see as soon as we choose automatic the cornea snaps right into place let's do this for all of the points and voila we now have a really nicelooking ground element so let's stop editing the spline here let's move up our objects so we can see everything clearly and there you go that's my introduction to sprite shapes from here it's up to you to create your own custom sprites to play around with and just have fun shaping your own Devils it's a really creative and fun tool to use I do also think that there is a lot of stuff that could be improved here I think the UI is a bit cluttered I think some of the ways that you set up your profiles is a bit overly complicated and generally could just use a tiny bit of tidying up but it is still in preview so we have to cut the developers some slack and it is already a really great tool in fact there's still stuff that you can do with this that I haven't shown you for example you can easily add variations if you don't want to just be tiling the same tile over and over and that's actually also an API you can use to script your own custom behavior if you want to learn more about those things I'll of course have a link in the description awesome so that's pretty
