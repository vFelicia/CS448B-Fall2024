00:00 - something you always need when making a
00:01 - 2-d game is of course a good camera and
00:04 - trust me if there's anything that's cost
00:07 - me a lot of pain and weird spaghetti
00:09 - code it's cameras luckily unity has made
00:12 - the process so much easier by adding a
00:14 - really solid set of features called
00:16 - cinema sheen and one of the coolest
00:18 - things about cinema sheen is that unlike
00:20 - this guy the cameras never run out of
00:22 - battery so in this video we'll turn this
00:24 - boring scene into this but first this
00:27 - video is sponsored by a skill share
00:28 - skill share is an online learning
00:30 - community with more than 23,000 quality
00:32 - classes on game development tech and
00:34 - more without channel kind of having a 2d
00:36 - theme at the moment I thought I'd
00:38 - mentioned they are complete 2-d game
00:39 - guide this guide is made by Christopher
00:41 - Navarre and gives you a complete crash
00:43 - course on how to develop 2d games in
00:45 - unity plus it also teaches you how to
00:47 - manage prefabs you see sharp scripting
00:50 - and much more a premium Skillshare
00:52 - membership gives you unlimited access to
00:54 - all classes for less than $10 a month so
00:56 - to get started simply click the link in
00:57 - description and the first 500 people
00:59 - will receive the first two months for
01:01 - free alright let's jump into the video
01:03 - so cinema Sheen is actually one of those
01:06 - parts of unity that isn't included by
01:08 - default luckily we can really easily get
01:10 - it by going to window and opening up the
01:12 - package manager let's then take this
01:14 - package manager and dock it at the
01:16 - bottom and you can see all the different
01:18 - packages that are currently included in
01:20 - our project we can also go to all in
01:23 - order to get a list of all the packages
01:25 - that are available to us
01:26 - let's find cinema Sheen and let's go to
01:29 - the right here and hit install and that
01:33 - is all we need to do we now see that in
01:35 - our project we have cinema sheen and it
01:37 - says that it's up to date so now to
01:39 - start using cinema Sheen we'll go to the
01:41 - top here where it says cinema sheen and
01:43 - here we have a bunch of options for
01:45 - different cameras that we can create of
01:47 - course the camera that we want to make
01:49 - is a 2d camera so we'll go to the bottom
01:51 - and hit create 2d camera and right away
01:53 - this might look really weird but fear
01:56 - not what's happening here is actually
01:58 - fairly simple so basically what we just
02:00 - created is what we refer to as a virtual
02:02 - camera you can see over here it says
02:04 - cinema Sheen virtual camera and the
02:06 - virtual camera is basically just like an
02:08 - empty object it's not visible in our
02:10 - scene and the only thing that it has is
02:12 - basically a
02:13 - in a rotation as well as some camera
02:16 - settings however what's in a machine
02:18 - that does is that it applies all the
02:20 - settings of our virtual camera to our
02:22 - actual main camera so if we go into the
02:24 - scene here and shift out of 2d mode we
02:26 - can see that we now have our virtual
02:28 - camera right in the center of our world
02:30 - here and that our main camera is at the
02:33 - exact same position in fact if we go
02:35 - ahead and move our virtual camera out so
02:38 - we move it backwards here we can see
02:40 - that the main camera follows and if we
02:42 - go into our virtual camera and adjust
02:45 - the orthographic size remember we can
02:47 - always use this in order to zoom in and
02:49 - out on a level let's set it to something
02:51 - like 5 this also being applied to a main
02:54 - camera you can see that that now has a
02:56 - size of 5 and at this point you might
02:58 - ask well if the only thing this object
03:00 - is doing is just adjusting our main
03:02 - camera well then why do we need it at
03:04 - all why don't we just adjust all this
03:06 - stuff on our main camera and be done
03:08 - with it and we could definitely do that
03:09 - for this super simple setup however
03:12 - using virtual cameras makes it really
03:15 - really easy to blend from one camera to
03:17 - another because we can have multiple
03:19 - virtual cameras in our scene and then
03:21 - just have our main camera switch between
03:23 - them so I'm just going to go down here
03:24 - and close our packages we don't need
03:26 - them anymore and now under this virtual
03:28 - camera we can see that we have a bunch
03:30 - of different settings and a lot of these
03:32 - we're just going to leave as is however
03:34 - one really important thing is that we
03:36 - can input an object here that we want to
03:39 - follow around of course the object that
03:41 - we would like to follow is our player so
03:43 - I'm simply going to take our player
03:44 - object and drag it into the follow slot
03:47 - and right away we can see that our
03:48 - camera snaps to our player in fact if I
03:51 - was just to go ahead and hit play now we
03:53 - actually already have a fully working 2d
03:55 - camera so you can see just how easy it
03:57 - is to set up cinema scene and start
03:59 - working with it
04:00 - of course cinema Sheen is a really
04:02 - powerful tool and there's lots of
04:03 - settings field that we can configure in
04:05 - order to change the way that our camera
04:07 - behaves if we go into where it says
04:09 - Barney we can change how our camera
04:11 - follows or player around so let's start
04:14 - by just setting all of our damping to 0
04:16 - let's also set our debt zone width and
04:18 - height to 0 as well and what we have
04:20 - here is probably the simplest way to
04:21 - track around a player the camera will
04:23 - always stay right on top of the player
04:25 - and we apply no kind
04:27 - smoothing to the camera to make it look
04:29 - better now let's make this a bit more
04:31 - sophisticated let's first of all adjust
04:33 - where we want our character to be framed
04:35 - on the screen right now he's dead center
04:37 - whenever I'm doing platformers I usually
04:39 - like to put him a bit above the middle
04:42 - so I'm gonna go ahead and adjust a
04:43 - screen why in order to pull him up a bit
04:45 - I just think that looks a lot better
04:47 - we can also add what we referred to as a
04:50 - dead zone let's try and increase the
04:52 - dead zone width and height the dead zone
04:54 - is basically a place on the screen that
04:57 - our character can move freely without
04:59 - the camera following him you can see if
05:01 - I move to the sides here the camera
05:03 - stays in place because I'm moving within
05:05 - the dead zone however at the moment that
05:08 - I step outside this zone we can see that
05:10 - the camera moves and this is true both
05:12 - for x and y now I think this dead zone
05:15 - here is probably a bit overdone but I
05:17 - definitely like to have a tiny bit in
05:19 - there so I'm gonna set my dead zone with
05:21 - to something like point two and the
05:23 - height to point one I think it's nice to
05:25 - keep the dead zone height fairly minimal
05:27 - so that it doesn't mess with jumping too
05:29 - much we can of course also smooth our
05:31 - cameras movement to do this we'll go and
05:33 - adjust the X&Y damping let's try setting
05:36 - both of these to one and we now see
05:38 - right away that our tracking point this
05:40 - yellow point right here actually gets to
05:42 - exit the dead zone because the camera is
05:45 - kind of smoothly following it whereas if
05:48 - we completely remove damping it will
05:50 - never leave the dead zone now I
05:52 - definitely recommend playing around with
05:53 - damping to find the right settings I'm
05:55 - gonna try setting these to three and you
05:57 - can see just how much smoothing this
05:58 - applies and in turn you can also put it
06:00 - at a fairly low number if you want
06:02 - really snappy controls I think in this
06:04 - case setting it to one works pretty well
06:06 - another setting that is often used for
06:08 - platformers is look ahead now this
06:11 - setting is meant to get rid of a very
06:13 - simple issue if we have smoothing on our
06:15 - camera as well as a dead zone and we
06:16 - start to run in a particular direction
06:18 - we can see that it's pretty hard to see
06:20 - what's going on in front of our
06:22 - character until there's something right
06:23 - there in other words it would be really
06:25 - nice if we could look kind of in front
06:27 - of the character and the camera
06:29 - recognized that we wanted to do this to
06:31 - do that we use these luga head settings
06:33 - if we increase the look ahead time to
06:35 - say something like 0.5 we can see that
06:38 - as soon as we start to move in a
06:39 - particular direction
06:41 - the tracking point moves forward in
06:43 - order to allow us to see what's in front
06:44 - of us
06:45 - now this might be a bit overdone but it
06:47 - definitely makes it much easier to see
06:49 - what's happening the look ahead time at
06:51 - just how much we want to look ahead so
06:53 - if we set this to one we can see that
06:55 - we're looking really far I'm just gonna
06:57 - set that to something like point three
06:58 - and as the name suggests look ahead
07:00 - smoothing allows us to smooth out this
07:02 - aberration so we can set that to twenty
07:04 - in order to get it really slow and
07:06 - smooth pan forward I'm going to set it
07:08 - to five in order to make this change
07:10 - really quick I'm just gonna leave it at
07:11 - something like ten finally one thing
07:13 - that I really like to do is ignore the
07:16 - why whenever we're looking ahead and
07:18 - that's because I really don't like what
07:19 - happens to the camera when jumping so
07:21 - I'm just gonna go ahead and press that
07:23 - and now we can see that when jumping
07:24 - nothing happens but it still happens on
07:27 - the X and that's pretty much the
07:29 - settings that I normally use finally we
07:31 - also have some settings down here that I
07:32 - rarely adjust these allow us to change
07:35 - this so-called soft zone if we go ahead
07:37 - and decrease these we can see that the
07:39 - red lines get smaller on the screen and
07:42 - you can see that as soon as the tracking
07:43 - point tries to exit the soft zone it
07:45 - just completely snaps and this ignores
07:48 - any kind of smoothing so this is nice to
07:50 - have in the case that your character
07:52 - moves extremely fast and you want to
07:54 - quickly follow him in this case you can
07:56 - just leave the soft zone at point eight
07:57 - point eight this way the character will
07:59 - always stay on the screen or if you
08:01 - don't care about this effect you can
08:02 - always press unlimited soft zone and
08:04 - that gets rid of the red lines
08:06 - altogether however I like it so I'm
08:08 - gonna put it back oops I accidentally
08:10 - removed the dead sounds let's just put
08:12 - that back that's pretty much it if you
08:14 - want to remove the window guides you
08:16 - know ways press this button here or in
08:18 - simply deselect the camera and now if we
08:20 - fullscreen and play the game we have a
08:22 - nice working camera that will follow
08:24 - around our player pretty cool that's
08:27 - pretty much it for this video if you

Cleaned transcript:

something you always need when making a 2d game is of course a good camera and trust me if there's anything that's cost me a lot of pain and weird spaghetti code it's cameras luckily unity has made the process so much easier by adding a really solid set of features called cinema sheen and one of the coolest things about cinema sheen is that unlike this guy the cameras never run out of battery so in this video we'll turn this boring scene into this but first this video is sponsored by a skill share skill share is an online learning community with more than 23,000 quality classes on game development tech and more without channel kind of having a 2d theme at the moment I thought I'd mentioned they are complete 2d game guide this guide is made by Christopher Navarre and gives you a complete crash course on how to develop 2d games in unity plus it also teaches you how to manage prefabs you see sharp scripting and much more a premium Skillshare membership gives you unlimited access to all classes for less than $10 a month so to get started simply click the link in description and the first 500 people will receive the first two months for free alright let's jump into the video so cinema Sheen is actually one of those parts of unity that isn't included by default luckily we can really easily get it by going to window and opening up the package manager let's then take
