00:00 - in this video we'll have a look at
00:01 - applying textures to our object but to
00:02 - do that we'll first have to go through
00:04 - the process of UV mapping UV mapping is
00:06 - something that a lot of beginners find
00:08 - really frightening but don't worry it's
00:10 - really hard I'm sure I'm just kidding so
00:12 - let's get started
00:13 - UV mapping is the process of projecting
00:15 - a 2d image a texture onto the surface of
00:18 - a 3d model to do this successfully we
00:20 - have to map out what parts of the image
00:22 - correspond to what parts of the model
00:24 - this is done by unwrapping it at this
00:26 - stage we imagine that our model is made
00:28 - of paper and that we want to unfold this
00:30 - paper to lay it out flat to make this
00:32 - easier we can cut our paper along the
00:34 - edges of our model these cuts are called
00:38 - seams so to start UV mapping our barrel
00:40 - we switch into the UV editing layout now
00:43 - here we have two windows that we want to
00:45 - focus on on the right of course we have
00:47 - our 3d viewport and on the Left we have
00:48 - our UV editor so this is the 3d view and
00:51 - this is the 2d surface that we lay out
00:53 - our UVs on we don't need this panel so
00:56 - I'm just going to get rid of it so first
00:57 - we want to hit tab to go into edit mode
00:59 - and our barrel is made up of three
01:00 - different pieces we have the main barrel
01:02 - and we have two rings the first thing we
01:04 - want to do is insert some themes I want
01:06 - to create a seam that separates the top
01:08 - part of our barrel from the sides let's
01:10 - hold down alt and right click in order
01:12 - to select the entire edge loop we can do
01:15 - the same at the bottom let's hold down
01:16 - shift and Alt + right click now we use
01:19 - our quick search by hitting space to
01:21 - search for mark seam and let's hit enter
01:24 - we now see that these edges are Mike
01:25 - with red what I also want to do is
01:27 - create a seam along this side of the
01:29 - barrel imagine that we're cutting
01:30 - through the barrel and we're laying out
01:32 - the sides here it's probably easier to
01:34 - just show you
01:35 - let's switch into H select mode let's
01:37 - select all the edges along the barrel
01:39 - here and let's again hit mark C so now
01:41 - if we go back into vertex mode select a
01:44 - single one of these vertices and hit the
01:46 - L key it's going to select the entire
01:48 - wooden part of our barrel we then hit u
01:51 - to bring up our UV mapping controls and
01:53 - unwrap now this might be really
01:55 - confusing to you in the beginning but
01:57 - what we see here is the wooden part of
01:58 - our barrel laid flat actually something
02:00 - really cool is that we can go down here
02:02 - and hit this little button this one I'll
02:05 - sync our selection between the two
02:06 - windows so if we deselect and go through
02:08 - and select different parts of our UVs we
02:11 - can see it's selecting different parts
02:12 - of our
02:13 - as well and so if we use our bug
02:15 - selection by hitting B to select the two
02:17 - top parts here we can see that that is
02:19 - the top part and button part of our
02:21 - barrel and that everything at the bottom
02:23 - of our UV map is actually the sides of
02:26 - our barrel you can also see that when I
02:28 - select the size of our barrel the outer
02:30 - rings here is ID of a swamp that's
02:31 - because these are the places where the
02:33 - sight connect to the top and bottom and
02:36 - so they are two selected now let's
02:37 - switch out of this mode and have a look
02:39 - at our two metal rings actually want to
02:41 - unwrap these in much the same way we did
02:43 - the barrel I want to Margaret seam at
02:45 - the top of our rings that's it Mike seam
02:48 - and at the bottom of our rings and I
02:50 - also want to make a cut right through
02:52 - them so go into edge select mode and
02:54 - select an edge going through both again
02:56 - Mark C let's now go back to vertex
02:58 - select select both our rings and hit u
03:01 - to unwrap here we can see four circles
03:04 - that's the upper and bottom part of each
03:06 - ring and two lines that's the outer part
03:08 - of our rings and this is why I'm going
03:10 - to show you something really cool
03:11 - because we could just go ahead and use
03:13 - these UVs as is meaning that we could go
03:16 - ahead and paint on top of them to add
03:17 - color but this is actually laid out in a
03:19 - really inefficient way because right now
03:21 - each individual side of our ring is
03:23 - using up texture space and I don't think
03:25 - we're going to have some different
03:26 - textures on each part instead we could
03:28 - use the same texture for both the bottom
03:30 - and top part of both rings to do that we
03:33 - select the vertices on one of the rings
03:34 - hit L to select the entire ring we then
03:37 - hit G and overlaid on top of one of the
03:40 - other rings and we keep doing this until
03:41 - all of the Rings are overlaid at the
03:43 - same place so now whatever we put here
03:46 - in our image is going to be displayed on
03:48 - all of the Rings in fact we can do the
03:50 - same thing with both our bands here we
03:52 - can select one of them hit L then grab
03:54 - it and hit Y to only move it on the y
03:56 - axis and there we go now we only need to
03:59 - text you one of the Rings and it will be
04:01 - applied to both so let's select these
04:02 - rings and move them up on the y-axis
04:04 - let's also move the rest of our rings up
04:07 - here if we then go ahead and select our
04:09 - entire object in the 3d view port you
04:11 - can see that we have plenty of space for
04:12 - our entire model series in fact we could
04:15 - go ahead and take the two bottom and top
04:17 - parts of our barrel here and even scale
04:19 - them up a little now that's of course a
04:20 - bunch of stuff and advanced techniques
04:22 - that we could use to improve this UV
04:24 - layer but for now this is going to work
04:25 - just fine so that's
04:27 - by overlaying a texture to do that we go
04:29 - down here we hit new we can give our
04:31 - texture and name I'm just going to call
04:33 - it feral you can give it some dimensions
04:35 - 1024 is plenty for our case you can give
04:38 - it a base color choose whether or not
04:40 - you want transparency on the parts that
04:42 - aren't textures in our case we'll just
04:44 - leave that off and you can choose to
04:45 - generate a texture if you select blank
04:47 - your entire texture is going to be black
04:49 - but we could also go in here and
04:51 - generate say a color grid these are
04:52 - useful for testing your UV layout so if
04:55 - we hit okay now we can see a color grid
04:57 - is generated and if you go to our 3d
04:59 - viewport and change our mode to texture
05:01 - voila our texture is now overlaid on top
05:04 - of our model this is probably easier to
05:06 - see if we switch out of edit mode and
05:07 - let's also go back to the default layout
05:10 - we'll probably need to change back to
05:11 - texture again so as you can see our UV
05:14 - map is not perfect we have a little
05:15 - distortion on a texture the lines aren't
05:17 - totally straight we also have a visible
05:19 - seam going down the side of our texture
05:21 - and you can definitely also see the seam
05:23 - at the top here but I think if I first
05:25 - go at unwrapping an object you can
05:27 - definitely be proud of it now that we've
05:29 - unwrapped our object it's time to
05:31 - texture it and there's pretty much a
05:32 - million ways to go about that some paint
05:34 - onto the models using software like
05:36 - ZBrush or mud box and some paint onto
05:39 - the 2d layout using some kind of photo
05:41 - editing software like Photoshop often
05:43 - bundled with quick so so texturing is a
05:46 - science in itself but especially if
05:48 - we're going for a low poly look it's
05:49 - actually fairly easy the first thing
05:51 - that I like to do is bake an ambient
05:53 - occlusion map ambient occlusion is the
05:55 - sort of shadows you get when two objects
05:57 - intersect and having blender
05:58 - automatically calculates this gives a
06:00 - really good base to work off of
06:02 - so in our default layout let's go over
06:04 - to the render panel that's the camera
06:06 - that's going to edit mode and select our
06:08 - entire object let's go down to where it
06:10 - says baked and the bake mode we want to
06:12 - set to ambient occlusion if we now hit
06:15 - the back button blender is going to do a
06:17 - bit of calculation and voila you should
06:19 - now see ambient occlusion on your object
06:21 - we see that we have some shadowing here
06:23 - at the top of our barrel and at the
06:24 - edges of our Rings and if we go into our
06:26 - UV editing mode we can see the texture
06:29 - now this texture is just an image and we
06:31 - can open it in any software and play
06:33 - around with it if you want to add stuff
06:34 - to a barrel in paint do so so let's try
06:37 - and export this image out let's go to
06:38 - image save as image I'm just going to
06:40 - say
06:40 - into my projects folder let's call it
06:42 - barrel that PNG hits save as image we
06:45 - navigate to the place where we saved our
06:47 - image a good free application for doing
06:49 - texture work is personally I use
06:51 - Photoshop so let's just drag in our
06:53 - barrel here and that's some different
06:55 - stuff we could do with this I'm just
06:56 - going to begin by adding a curves
06:58 - adjustment and making everything a bit
06:59 - brighter I'll then go and select text
07:01 - and then add a company name to the side
07:04 - of the barrel let's call it Smith & Sons
07:06 - and yes I found a wasting fund for this
07:08 - particular purpose let's also have it
07:10 - say something like beer at the top here
07:13 - so we know what's inside I'm going to
07:15 - double click this to add a color overlay
07:16 - and the color I want here is kind of a
07:19 - darker shade of brown something like
07:21 - that and I also want to select our text
07:23 - and add an arc
07:24 - I'll now duplicate the text by hitting
07:26 - ctrl J hit ctrl T in order to be able to
07:29 - rotate it and then drag it down here and
07:33 - it's pretty much all I want to do for my
07:34 - texture if you want to texture that
07:36 - looks more like real wood you can just
07:38 - go in Google search for a wood texture
07:40 - and overlay it on top of the image but I
07:42 - like this minimal style so let's now go
07:44 - file save as we're going to save it
07:46 - again as a PNG and I'm just going to
07:48 - save it on top of our original file it
07:50 - gets to replace I'm going to hit OK and
07:52 - now when we go into blender if it
07:54 - doesn't update right away we go image
07:56 - reload image or hit old R and there we
07:59 - go we can see that our texture is now
08:00 - overlaid on top of our barrel now that's
08:03 - of course a few problems with this I
08:04 - think the texture is way too big and I
08:06 - also put the beard tag on the wrong side
08:09 - so we can very quickly fix that let's
08:11 - just take our to be tags here move them
08:13 - over
08:13 - let's also scale down our font also I
08:16 - probably don't want this to be totally
08:18 - white but somewhere in between again I'm
08:20 - going to save that and in blender hit
08:22 - old R and there we go
08:24 - congratulations on texturing your first
08:26 - object oh and remember to save let's

in this video we'll have a look at applying textures to our object but to do that we'll first have to go through the process of UV mapping UV mapping is something that a lot of beginners find really
