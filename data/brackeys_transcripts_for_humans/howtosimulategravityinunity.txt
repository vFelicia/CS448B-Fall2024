00:00 - so while back I did a video on forces in
00:02 - there I had a gravity simulation in
00:03 - unity a lot of you guys were asking for
00:05 - tutorial so in this video we'll have a
00:06 - look at how you can implement Newton's
00:08 - universal law of gravity in unity and of
00:10 - course if you want to know more about
00:11 - the theory behind it you can check out
00:12 - the other video so let's get into it
00:14 - here is the basic thing with a camera
00:16 - some lights and a planet I got the model
00:19 - of the acid store and the same thing for
00:21 - these skybox another link for both in
00:23 - the description now currently on my
00:24 - planet I only have a mesh filter and a
00:26 - mesh renderer let's go ahead and add a
00:29 - sphere Collider as well and we also add
00:31 - a new component this is going to be a
00:33 - custom script that will handle all the
00:34 - fog gravitational code you could go
00:36 - ahead and call it planet or celestial
00:38 - body but gravity doesn't only work for
00:40 - planets gravity applies to all objects
00:43 - with a mass so let's instead just call
00:45 - it a tractor it's 2 C sharp and hit
00:47 - create an ad let's open it up in Visual
00:49 - Studio now first off we can go ahead and
00:50 - delete our two methods and let's instead
00:52 - create a method called attract this
00:55 - method is where the magic happens now
00:57 - attraction happens between two objects
00:59 - so as an argument that's taking another
01:02 - attractor which is going to be the
01:03 - object that we want to attract we can
01:05 - call this object to attract now
01:08 - according to Newton's law of universal
01:09 - gravitation there's a few things that we
01:11 - need in order to calculate the
01:12 - gravitational force between two objects
01:15 - the first one is the position of the two
01:16 - objects we'll use this to get both the
01:18 - distance between them and the direction
01:20 - to apply a force in but we'll also need
01:22 - the object's mass now we could of course
01:24 - go up here and define a mass on our own
01:27 - and we also use some more of Newton's
01:28 - laws to calculate how the objects would
01:30 - move after we apply forces to them but
01:32 - unity actually has a component built in
01:34 - for this sort of stuff already
01:35 - so don't see a reason to reinvent the
01:37 - wheel on this one I'm of course talking
01:39 - about the rigidbody component now what
01:41 - we need to do is just make sure that
01:42 - every attractor has a rigidbody
01:44 - component we'll call it
01:45 - RB and let's also make sure to mark it
01:48 - as public so that we can access it from
01:50 - another attractor if we now just save
01:52 - this and go into unity we of course also
01:54 - need to add the component so let's hit
01:56 - add component of type rigidbody and
01:59 - let's drag it into the slot on the
02:01 - rigidbody component we'll make sure to
02:03 - disable use gravity because we want to
02:05 - apply that on our own and here we can
02:06 - adjust the mass now the mass for a
02:09 - planet like Earth is huge and that's
02:12 - despite earth being
02:13 - fairly small luckily however we can
02:15 - define ourselves what unit we're using
02:17 - so we could just say that a massive one
02:19 - here equals six times 10 to the power of
02:22 - 24 kilograms if you're going for realism
02:24 - just make sure to keep the proportions
02:26 - right in our case here let's just set
02:28 - the mass to something like a thousand
02:29 - and of course this will also totally
02:31 - depend on the scale of your scene my
02:33 - planet is fairly big compared to the
02:35 - standard unity sphere so that's why I'm
02:37 - kind of bumping up our mass we can now
02:39 - go into visual studio and we can now
02:41 - access our mass we can also access the
02:43 - rigid body of the object that we're
02:45 - trying to attract let's store that in a
02:47 - variable as well of type rigidbody let's
02:49 - call it the RB to attract and we can
02:52 - just set it equal to obj to attract RB
02:55 - and now we're ready to do some math
02:57 - first off let's get the direction
02:58 - between the object that we're trying to
03:00 - attract to this object we'll do that by
03:02 - taking our current position and
03:03 - subtracting the position of the oddly
03:05 - object we can then store this in a
03:08 - vector3 called direction now in order to
03:11 - get the distance between the two objects
03:13 - all we need to do is make a float called
03:15 - distance and set it equal to our
03:17 - direction vectors magnitude in other
03:20 - words the length of our direction vector
03:22 - then we can calculate the magnitude of
03:24 - our force let's create a float called
03:25 - force magnitude and this is where
03:28 - Newton's central equation comes in we'll
03:30 - take the mass of the one object our bead
03:32 - mass multiplied with the mass of the
03:34 - audio object or be two attracted mass
03:36 - and we'll then divide that by the
03:38 - distance between them squared so square
03:40 - our distance will go math.pow to take a
03:43 - number and lift it to a power in our
03:45 - case we want to take the number of
03:46 - distance and lift it to the power two
03:48 - and now we can create our final force
03:50 - vector let's create a vector three
03:52 - called
03:53 - force and set it equal to our direction
03:55 - vector dot normalized and then multiply
03:58 - it with our force magnitude in other
04:01 - words we'll apply a force in the
04:02 - direction of our object with a strength
04:04 - defined by Newton's equation then in
04:06 - order to apply that force we'll go our
04:08 - be to attract dot add force and here
04:11 - we'll simply input a force vector now of
04:14 - course we aren't calling this method
04:15 - anywhere so currently we will see
04:17 - nothing happening to change that that's
04:19 - going and create a void fixedupdate
04:21 - method remember fixedupdate is called a
04:24 - fixed amount of times per second and we
04:26 - use it
04:27 - all of our physics code here we want to
04:28 - find all the other attractors in our
04:30 - scene I'll show you how to optimize this
04:32 - in a second but for now we can just use
04:34 - fine objects of type and we want to find
04:36 - all a tractors we learn create an
04:39 - attractors array called attractors and
04:42 - set it equal to the objects we found
04:45 - will then create a for each statement
04:46 - what we'll loop through all of the
04:48 - attractor components and we'll call each
04:51 - one the attractor in our attractors
04:53 - array and for each one of these
04:55 - attractors we'll call attract where the
04:57 - object to attract is the attractor
04:59 - recurrently looking at let's now try and
05:01 - save this go into unity select our
05:04 - planet drag it into the project panel to
05:06 - create a prefab out of it let's then
05:08 - duplicate our planet by going ctrl D
05:10 - move it over and let's do this a few
05:12 - times and once you have a few different
05:13 - planets scattered around let's try and
05:15 - hit play now of course we'll get a bunch
05:18 - of errors the reason why it is a simple
05:20 - mistake in our logic when we loop
05:21 - through all of the attractors we find
05:23 - we're actually also looping over our
05:25 - current object that means that each
05:27 - object is also trying to attract itself
05:29 - and getting the direction from point A
05:31 - to point a and the distance between
05:33 - point a and point a doesn't make too
05:35 - much sense so let's go in here and make
05:36 - sure that we check if the attractor we
05:39 - are looking at is not equal to this
05:41 - attractor well then we'll go ahead and
05:43 - call attract let's now try again to hit
05:45 - play and depending on the masses of your
05:48 - object this might look really cool or as
05:50 - boring as - if we look at the position
05:52 - we can see the values are actually
05:54 - changing it's just happening super
05:56 - slowly if we select all of our planets
05:59 - and bump up the mass by putting say
06:00 - another zero here then we can start to
06:02 - see something happening especially if we
06:04 - do that once more luckily we can easily
06:06 - control the scale of all gravitation
06:08 - using a symbol constant and this
06:10 - constant is actually already part of the
06:12 - equation it's called the gravitational
06:13 - constant or just capital G for short
06:16 - let's go ahead and create this in a
06:17 - variable let's make it a constant float
06:20 - we'll call it capital G and this is
06:22 - another one of those ridiculous numbers
06:24 - this one is ridiculously small we can
06:26 - play around with this in any way we want
06:28 - let's just take the base number here six
06:30 - point six seven four put that in here
06:33 - let's just move up with the decimal
06:34 - place a few times here and let's go down
06:36 - to where we calculate our force
06:37 - magnitude and make sure to multiply with
06:40 - gee we now say that going to unity and
06:42 - hit play and now gravitation should be
06:45 - happening at a much quicker rate awesome
06:47 - there's really not much more to it using
06:49 - just the system we have now we can start
06:51 - messing around with planets masses and
06:53 - adding other forces to say make a planet
06:55 - orbit another that's just for fun take
06:57 - our second planet here and scale it up a
06:59 - bit and let's just increase the mass
07:00 - here by a factor 10 if you know it play
07:03 - we should see that all the other planets
07:04 - would get drawn towards this one fairly
07:06 - quickly now in case you want to have
07:10 - huge amounts of planets I definitely
07:12 - recommend that you optimize it a little
07:13 - bit a way to do this is to avoid
07:15 - searching for other attractors each
07:17 - fixedupdate call instead let's go ahead
07:19 - and create a public static list of
07:22 - attractors and we call this our
07:24 - attractors then whenever an object is
07:27 - enabled so void on enabled we want to
07:31 - register this object into the attractors
07:33 - list so will seem to go attractors add
07:36 - this of course we also need to make sure
07:39 - to initialize the attractors array so in
07:41 - here we'll just add a small if statement
07:43 - saying if attractors is equal to null
07:46 - then we'll set attractors equal to a new
07:50 - list of attractors and then on disables
07:53 - so void on disable will go ahead and
07:56 - remove from the attractors list so let's
07:58 - go attractors dot remove this then then
08:02 - the fixedupdate code we can simply avoid
08:03 - this line altogether and simply loop
08:06 - through all of the attractors in our
08:08 - attractors list and I got a bunch of
08:10 - errors here and that's because I
08:12 - misspelled on enable we need to disable
08:14 - the D there and now great play or seen
08:17 - is much more performant one thing you
08:19 - will notice is that if you go ahead and
08:20 - duplicate an object it will show you a
08:22 - quick error the reason for that is that
08:25 - when an object gets duplicated you will
08:27 - have two objects at the exact same
08:28 - position and again our equation does not
08:30 - like that so we'll simply go in here and
08:32 - say that if our distance is equal to
08:35 - zero well then we simply want to return
08:37 - out of it
08:37 - now things are just a little bit safer
08:39 - and we should now be able to hit play
08:41 - select an object and duplicated with no
08:43 - problem that's pretty much it for this

Cleaned transcript:

so while back I did a video on forces in there I had a gravity simulation in unity a lot of you guys were asking for tutorial so in this video we'll have a look at how you can implement Newton's universal law of gravity in unity and of course if you want to know more about the theory behind it you can check out the other video so let's get into it here is the basic thing with a camera some lights and a planet I got the model of the acid store and the same thing for these skybox another link for both in the description now currently on my planet I only have a mesh filter and a mesh
