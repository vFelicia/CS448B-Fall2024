00:02 - hello and welcome to video number 26 in
00:06 - our survival game series done by
00:08 - practice I'm the CEO of Brad keys and
00:10 - this video is going to be a rather short
00:13 - one we're gonna take a look at
00:15 - preventing weapon clipping so making it
00:19 - so that our weapon or our arms and and
00:22 - other you stuff attached to our player
00:24 - will not go through objects so that can
00:28 - be seen at any time and we also going to
00:32 - be making a few minor tweaks and fixes
00:34 - here and there so let's open up a unity
00:38 - as always first of all I just want to
00:42 - select my player and under here we have
00:45 - our main camera and under there we have
00:48 - our arms and it's these arms I want to
00:52 - make a separate layer then we can have a
00:57 - second camera just render that layer and
01:01 - then we can set it to depth only which
01:05 - will mean that they will be rendered no
01:08 - matter what no matter matter what so
01:11 - even though they're inside another
01:13 - object or behind another object we will
01:16 - still be able to see them so that's
01:20 - really cool so what we're going to do
01:21 - now is we are just going to take a look
01:24 - at what's inside our arms because
01:26 - everything that are inside of our arms
01:29 - will also be set to this layer and that
01:33 - means whenever we are going to equipped
01:35 - weapons to these arms that will also be
01:40 - be rendered by this cigarette be
01:43 - rendered by the secondary camera okay
01:46 - cool so what we're going to do now is
01:48 - we're going to select our player hit
01:51 - game object create other and then where
01:56 - we have it that camera and now let's
01:58 - like this too and rename it to something
02:01 - like weapon camera I'm gonna type draw
02:09 - always
02:12 - and then I'm going to drag that under
02:15 - the main camera and center the position
02:18 - and the rotation so that's really
02:22 - important you do that else everything is
02:24 - going to look pretty weird now we go to
02:28 - our clear flags and set this to depth
02:31 - only and the culling mask is something
02:35 - we're going to play with in a sec so now
02:37 - we can go ahead and select our arms go
02:40 - to the lair hit add layer call this draw
02:46 - always then select our arms again go up
02:53 - on the layer select our draw always
02:55 - layer hit yes change children and
03:00 - remember you have to do this with all
03:02 - the weapons too so set them to the layer
03:04 - draw always now we go and our main
03:07 - camera to make sure that it won't be
03:09 - drawn by our main camera because we
03:11 - won't do it won't we don't want to draw
03:14 - this two times so go under the culling
03:17 - mask and this is basically what it's
03:20 - going to draw and by drawing I of course
03:23 - mean a show and then we want to disable
03:27 - the draw always so now we see them
03:29 - disabled under the main camera here so
03:32 - if we were to go ahead and play the game
03:34 - right now you can see that it's not
03:38 - really working and it's all also pretty
03:42 - hard on the computer because we have two
03:44 - cameras drawing both things anyway so
03:48 - now we go under our draw always and then
03:52 - we want to disable these components
03:54 - because we don't need them we want them
03:56 - to be handled by our main camera so just
03:59 - remove component flour layer GUI layer
04:02 - and audio listener now we want to go
04:06 - under our depth and we want to change
04:09 - this to something higher than our main
04:11 - camera to one then we can go under our
04:18 - culling mask it's like nothing and then
04:22 - select the draw always and now it will
04:24 - only
04:24 - our hands as we can see here and now it
04:28 - should be working so if we hit play we
04:32 - can see our hands are being drawn and we
04:35 - have no error saying that there are more
04:37 - than one audio listening the scene they
04:40 - are only being drawn once and if we now
04:44 - run into a post or anything like that we
04:47 - can see that they are not clipping
04:49 - through so we can always see your hands
04:52 - and this is really something that has
04:55 - been standardized in the industry for a
04:59 - long long time because if we were to
05:01 - disable this camera go in the main
05:04 - camera and put back on the draw always
05:08 - you can see the arms going through
05:14 - objects so let's hit this back on main
05:18 - camera and then draw a long ways off
05:21 - okay cool so now that we had that setup
05:24 - I'm just going to make a few changes the
05:28 - first one I want to make is select our
05:30 - player select the graphics and then I
05:34 - want to apply a red color to this so
05:37 - that I can always find our player or any
05:40 - color you might like so now we go into
05:43 - our materials and I hit create material
05:47 - I'm going to call this maybe we should
05:51 - do a blue actually so blue then select
05:58 - our player graphics drag in the blue and
06:05 - now we can change the main color to blue
06:09 - and you can really pick whatever your
06:14 - color you want actually let's go with
06:16 - the black keys color so let's change
06:17 - this to purple or leather or yeah let's
06:24 - go with that that's really girly but
06:27 - that's what we're going to go with for
06:30 - now that just makes it easier to quickly
06:33 - fund I play out if we view it from a
06:35 - distance
06:37 - the last change I want to make is
06:39 - something you have been asking me to do
06:41 - and that's showing how to hide the
06:44 - slider you're up here if you're done
06:47 - with testing I think it's really nice to
06:50 - have it there whenever you're testing
06:52 - out levels because then you can quickly
06:53 - view them at different points in time
06:56 - but I'm just going to show you how to
06:59 - disable it so if we go on our day night
07:01 - cycle then under time of day we have our
07:05 - time of day script we can go ahead and
07:07 - open that up and it will load in
07:12 - monodevelop
07:17 - this is taking quite a while so let's
07:20 - just try this one more time there we
07:22 - have it and oh these are some scripts
07:31 - are used to make the inventory which is
07:34 - something we're going to cover in future
07:35 - videos the next one is probably going to
07:37 - be about making them so look forward to
07:41 - that but in the future we will get to
07:44 - the inventory I promise so now undo
07:47 - function on GUI we have the slider
07:50 - equals GUI horizontal slider and so on
07:53 - this is something you can just go ahead
07:55 - and delete or comment out so I'm just
07:58 - going to make these two dash signs and
08:02 - now when we save this and whoops we open
08:07 - two instances of monodevelop that so
08:10 - when we save this and hidden hit play
08:13 - you can see that it's not being drawn
08:16 - and the time of day will still change
08:20 - okay so now I'm going to show you how
08:22 - you can change the editor the script
08:26 - editor so if you are not interested in
08:28 - using monodevelop but would rather use
08:31 - something like notepad plus plus this is
08:34 - how you do it so you of course you start
08:36 - out by downloading the program and
08:38 - whenever you have it installed and this
08:41 - is what you do so you go to edit and
08:43 - then you go to preferences then you go
08:47 - to external tools
08:50 - then there you see the external script
08:52 - editor then we can click on this
08:56 - monodevelop and if it's not well in here
08:59 - you go to browse and then you find the
09:02 - location where you have installed it I
09:03 - think I installed mine on 2d programs
09:07 - then you find the notepad plus plus I
09:10 - actually might have installed it on the
09:12 - C program files notepad plus plus there
09:17 - you have it and then you select the
09:20 - application XE so we hit open and now we
09:23 - can see that that is a chosen here so we
09:27 - can go ahead and delete this for close
09:29 - this down and now when we go ahead to
09:33 - open the script so let's go into the
09:35 - scripts folder and let's just open up
09:38 - the advanced di you can see that's what
09:41 - opens up so now it opens up in notepad
09:44 - plus plus so that's pretty much it for
09:48 - this tutorial I know it was a short one
09:50 - but this was just a bunch of requests I
09:53 - have done V you guys I just thought I
09:55 - would clear up and get out of the way
09:58 - before we continue with the makin in
10:00 - parts so I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
10:03 - see you in the next video
