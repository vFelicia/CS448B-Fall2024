00:00 - look who's turning in so here is the
00:01 - last video in the how to make a video
00:03 - game series today we're going to be
00:04 - finishing our game by creating a credit
00:06 - screen a Welcome menu and making
00:08 - everything ready for the export phase
00:09 - let's get started
00:10 - so the first thing I want to do is to
00:12 - lead our level 2 that we created in a
00:13 - previous video and the reason for this
00:15 - is that we need to optimize the way that
00:16 - we create levels I see a lot of
00:18 - beginners simply duplicating their first
00:19 - level making a few changes and then
00:21 - repeating that process until they have
00:23 - enough levels and then of course makes
00:25 - sense and it's also what we're going to
00:26 - be doing but unless you think a bit
00:28 - about optimizing the process it makes it
00:30 - very difficult to go back and change
00:31 - settings so if we wanted to change some
00:33 - settings on the player we would have to
00:35 - do that on all the levels that is one of
00:37 - the reasons why we use prefabs so we can
00:39 - just take our player along with our game
00:41 - manager drag it down here our main
00:44 - camera our endpoint and our canvas and
00:47 - turn all of that into a prefab and I
00:49 - think these are all of the objects that
00:50 - we are realistically going to be
00:52 - changing but you could go nuts and
00:53 - change all the objects to prefabs this
00:55 - way we can easily update something and
00:57 - it will change on all of the levels now
00:59 - this is a bit of a hacky approach it's
01:01 - going to work fine for beginner games
01:02 - and that's also why we're going to be
01:04 - doing it here if you are creating a
01:05 - larger game you would either a make some
01:08 - kind of editor tool that makes it easier
01:09 - for you to create levels or be have all
01:12 - of your level data in a separate scene
01:13 - that you then load on top of your main
01:16 - scene if you want to learn more about
01:17 - that stuff I'll have some links in the
01:18 - description for now we can just go ahead
01:20 - and create a folder for all of our
01:22 - prefabs here let's select the canvas and
01:24 - game manager main camera obstacle and
01:26 - player and drag those in there and now
01:28 - we can save the scene and duplicate it
01:30 - as many times as we want I'm just going
01:32 - to duplicate it a few times here and you
01:34 - should of course go nuts now and create
01:36 - a bunch of interesting levels I'm just
01:37 - going to take the first one here and I'm
01:39 - going to remove some of the obstacles
01:40 - actually I'm going to remove all of
01:42 - these I'm going to take these two and
01:44 - move them forward a bit and space them
01:46 - out so this is going to be a really easy
01:47 - start level let's say that go into the
01:49 - second one and here I'm just going to
01:51 - remove about every second obstacle just
01:53 - to also make this a lot easier let's
01:55 - save that and then level three is going
01:57 - to be off full level now these are all
01:58 - really short but they're just for test
02:00 - purposes now we can go ahead and create
02:02 - a separate thing that is going to act as
02:03 - our end screen this theme will be loaded
02:05 - when we complete the last level in our
02:07 - case level 3 let's go file new scene or
02:10 - press control and let's create some UI
02:11 - so let's go and right click go you
02:13 - I knit select panel again the panel is
02:15 - just an image that fills our entire
02:17 - screen let's switch to 2d mode and hit F
02:19 - to focus on it let's remove the source
02:21 - image so we just get a blank color and
02:23 - let's make this non transparent it's
02:24 - also making a big grey we're going to
02:26 - call this panel credits and on top we'll
02:28 - create a UI element text again that's it
02:31 - f to focus on it and that makes it more
02:33 - room for this one I'm holding down alt
02:34 - to scale from the center it's also
02:36 - centered on the x and y let's change the
02:38 - text to something like thanks for
02:41 - playing and let's make the font size
02:42 - something around 50 I'm going to widen
02:45 - it a bit it's also going to define and
02:47 - change it to Roboto thin you can see now
02:49 - that if we maximize our game by hitting
02:51 - shift space oh it takes place the same
02:53 - size to change this we go to the canvas
02:55 - and change the UI scale mode to scale
02:57 - with screen size and drag it all the way
02:59 - to fit the height so now it scales up we
03:01 - can then take our text object and move
03:02 - it up let's rename it to something like
03:04 - thanks
03:05 - and then duplicate it by hitting ctrl D
03:07 - shift drag it down towards the center
03:09 - let's change the text to made by let's
03:12 - change the font size to something like
03:14 - 20 and change the font to Roboto medium
03:17 - again we can duplicate this move it down
03:20 - and you can just write your name I'm
03:21 - just going to write brackets
03:23 - change the font size to 50 again and
03:25 - define back to Roboto thin I think that
03:28 - looks pretty good let's also take these
03:29 - two text elements and move them up a bit
03:31 - and let's rename the first one to made
03:34 - by and the second one to practice
03:35 - finally we can create a button that will
03:38 - allow us to exit the game so I'm going
03:40 - to right click on the credits go UI and
03:42 - then button let's move this down a lot
03:44 - in the center let's scale it up I don't
03:46 - want it to be too big and then I'm going
03:47 - to show you some pretty cool button
03:49 - styling that I like to do I like to take
03:51 - the source image and select none' again
03:53 - so we get a flat colleague I like to
03:54 - leave this ad completely white then I'm
03:56 - going to add a new component and the
03:58 - component we want to add a shadow now
04:00 - this allows us to cast a hard shadow
04:02 - onto the background I'm going to select
04:04 - 0 on the X and negative 2 on the Y and
04:07 - then going to decrease the opacity this
04:09 - gives it kind of a cold simplistic
04:11 - modern look I'm also going to make the
04:13 - button even smaller then we can change
04:15 - the text of the button let's change the
04:16 - text to quit the font to Roboto
04:19 - regular and the font size to something
04:22 - around 20 we can maybe also make the
04:24 - color a bit lighter I think
04:25 - better so when you're satisfied with
04:27 - this all we need to do is hook up the
04:29 - button to some kind of script let's go
04:30 - to our credits and add one we can just
04:32 - go ahead and call it credits and let's
04:34 - open it up in Visual Studio now whenever
04:36 - we want to trigger some code using a
04:38 - button we need to make sure that the
04:40 - function we create is marked as public
04:41 - normally when we make a function we just
04:43 - write void then the name of the function
04:45 - in our case this would be something like
04:47 - quit and then some curly brackets but
04:49 - you can see that if we save this and go
04:51 - back into unity and then go and select
04:53 - our button we add an on click event this
04:55 - means that whenever our button is
04:57 - clicked it's going to notify what every
04:59 - object we put in here and we're going to
05:01 - put the credits object because that's
05:02 - where our script is sitting and that's
05:03 - the function we want to call we're going
05:05 - to go on your credits and then here you
05:07 - can see that there's no quick method so
05:08 - instead we go into visual studio and we
05:10 - mark it as public now when we save we
05:13 - should see that when we try and search
05:15 - for a function
05:16 - it appears let's select that and now
05:17 - every time we click this button it's
05:19 - quit button everything inside of these
05:21 - two curly brackets will happen and we
05:23 - only want something very simple we want
05:25 - to create the application so we go
05:26 - application dot quit and we're not going
05:29 - to be able to see this happening because
05:31 - unity won't actually quit the game when
05:33 - it's inside of unity only when you
05:34 - export it will it actually close down
05:36 - the window so we'll just throw a debug
05:38 - deadlock statement asphault let's say
05:40 - something like quit now if we play the
05:42 - game hover over and click our button you
05:45 - can see that the message quit appears in
05:47 - the console and it will do this every
05:48 - time we click that button of course when
05:50 - we export the game we'll only be able to
05:52 - click it once awesome now if you want
05:54 - you can really easily take the scene and
05:55 - make it into menu to do that we save it
05:58 - and this one is going to be called
05:59 - credits we then duplicate the credits
06:01 - scene and let's rename this to something
06:03 - like menu or welcome screen let's double
06:05 - click that and nothing changes but we
06:07 - are now indeed viewing the menu scene we
06:09 - can then change around some of these
06:10 - settings up here we can say welcome to
06:13 - and then remove brackets here and change
06:16 - the made by to some name for the game
06:18 - it's really popular to use some kind of
06:20 - twist on the void cube cube tastic oh
06:22 - that's cute I'm just going to go with
06:24 - cubes on yeahit's marathon and cube
06:26 - combined it's not good but it's the best
06:28 - I've got right now let's bump up the
06:29 - font size and maybe also change the
06:31 - color to kind of red just to keep things
06:34 - interesting
06:34 - let's drag down the welcome to a little
06:36 - bit let's drag up the button and we want
06:38 - to change some names
06:39 - so credits will be renamed to welcome
06:41 - things will be renamed to welcome to
06:44 - made by will be renamed to cubed on and
06:47 - the text of our button will be changed
06:48 - to start let's take all these objects
06:51 - and move them down a little bit let's
06:53 - also go to a welcome object before it
06:55 - was called credits and remove the
06:56 - credits script let's instead add another
06:58 - script called menu and in here of course
07:01 - we just want to create a single function
07:02 - that will start the game let's open it
07:05 - clean up and let's create again a public
07:07 - void and we can't call it start because
07:10 - that's a function already created by
07:11 - unity let's call it start game then we
07:14 - want to load the next scene so we'll be
07:16 - using unity engine dot scene management
07:19 - like we've done before and we want to
07:21 - write scene manager dot load scene and
07:23 - the scene we want to load is the next
07:25 - scene so we want to get the current
07:27 - scene are going scene manager get active
07:30 - scene then dot build index and then +1
07:33 - if you're confused about what this does
07:35 - check out the last video let's save this
07:37 - going to unity now let's select our
07:39 - button you can see that the on click
07:41 - event is currently missing an object so
07:42 - let's drag in the welcome object let's
07:44 - go in the function and select menu start
07:47 - game now the last thing we need to do in
07:49 - order to string all this together let's
07:51 - go to file build settings and add all of
07:53 - our scenes into the build let's start by
07:56 - adding the menu and we want this to be
07:57 - on top because we want this to be the
07:59 - first scene that we see within the old
08:01 - level 1 level 2 then level 3 and finally
08:04 - the credits I'm also just going to take
08:06 - the two scripts here and drag them under
08:08 - the scripts folder and that should
08:09 - actually be it our game should be fully
08:11 - playable with the menu screen credits
08:13 - and several levels and if we're able to
08:16 - run this now we're actually ready for
08:18 - the export phase so let's hit play it's
08:20 - going to say welcome to cubes on let's
08:22 - select start to start the game you can
08:24 - see I'm in here on the first level that
08:26 - is really easy it's going to say level
08:28 - complete go to the next level that is
08:30 - just a tiny bit harder again level
08:33 - complete and here comes the third level
08:35 - and of course you can make these levels
08:38 - as challenging as you want and finally
08:41 - because we completed all the levels it's
08:42 - going to say thanks for playing and some
08:44 - credits and then we have the button
08:46 - quick here when we click that it's going
08:48 - to say quit and if this was an actual
08:50 - application it would
08:52 - down so that's pretty much it for this
08:53 - video and this series you made it all
08:55 - the way through congratulations on that
08:57 - and congratulations on making your first
08:59 - step as a game developer I decided to
09:01 - keep this video series pretty short so
09:02 - that most people would be able to
09:04 - complete it but I definitely want to
09:06 - make more beginner-friendly videos the
09:07 - new videos will just be on standard on
09:09 - subjects I'm going to begin by making a
09:11 - video on exporting your game to
09:12 - different platforms and we're going to
09:14 - use this as an example project so
09:16 - definitely subscribe and stay tuned for
09:18 - more so without further adieu thanks for
09:19 - watching and I will see you in the next
09:21 - video thanks of the awesome patreon
09:23 - supporters who donated in March and a
09:25 - special thanks to Derek Eames Kirk face
09:26 - llanera find James Calhoun and Jason the
09:28 - Tito if you want to support the channel
09:30 - and become a picture in yourself you
09:31 - would do so a patron account slash
09:33 - brackets thanks a lot guys

Cleaned transcript:

look who's turning in so here is the last video in the how to make a video game series today we're going to be finishing our game by creating a credit screen a Welcome menu and making everything ready for the export phase let's get started so the first thing I want to do is to lead our level 2 that we created in a previous video and the reason for this is that we need to optimize the way that we create levels I see a lot of beginners simply duplicating their first level making a few changes and then repeating that process until they have enough levels and then of course makes sense and it's also what we're going to be doing but unless you think a bit about optimizing the process it makes it very difficult to go back and change settings so if we wanted to change some settings on the player we would have to do that on all the levels that is one of the reasons why we use prefabs so we can just take our player along with our game manager drag it down here our main camera our endpoint and our canvas and turn all of that into a prefab and I think these are all of the objects that we are realistically going to be changing but you could go nuts and change all the objects to prefabs this way we can easily update something and it will change on all of the levels now this is a bit of a hacky approach it's going to work fine for beginner games and that's also why we're going to be doing it here if you are creating a larger game you would either a make some kind of editor tool that makes it easier for you to create levels or be have all of your level data in a separate scene that you then load on top of your main scene if you want to learn more about that stuff I'll have some links in the description for now we can just go ahead and create a folder for all of our prefabs here let's select the canvas and game manager main camera obstacle and player and drag those in there and now we can save the scene and duplicate it as many times as we want I'm just going to duplicate it a few times here and you should of course go nuts now and create a bunch of interesting levels I'm just going to take the first one here and I'm going to remove some of the obstacles actually I'm going to remove all of these I'm going to take these two and move them forward a bit and space them out so this is going to be a really easy start level let's say that go into the second one and here I'm just going to remove about every second obstacle just to also make this a lot easier let's save that and then level three is going to be off full level now these are all really short but they're just for test purposes now we can go ahead and create a separate thing that is going to act as our end screen this theme will be loaded when we complete the last level in our case level 3 let's go file new scene or press control and let's create some UI so let's go and right click go you I knit select panel again the panel is just an image that fills our entire screen let's switch to 2d mode and hit F to focus on it let's remove the source image so we just get a blank color and let's make this non transparent it's also making a big grey we're going to call this panel credits and on top we'll create a UI element text again that's it f to focus on it and that makes it more room for this one I'm holding down alt to scale from the center it's also centered on the x and y let's change the text to something like thanks for playing and let's make the font size something around 50 I'm going to widen it a bit it's also going to define and change it to Roboto thin you can see now that if we maximize our game by hitting shift space oh it takes place the same size to change this we go to the canvas and change the UI scale mode to scale with screen size and drag it all the way to fit the height so now it scales up we can then take our text object and move it up let's rename it to something like thanks and then duplicate it by hitting ctrl D shift drag it down towards the center let's change the text to made by let's change the font size to something like 20 and change the font to Roboto medium again we can duplicate this move it down and you can just write your name I'm just going to write brackets change the font size to 50 again and define back to Roboto thin I think that looks pretty good let's also take these two text elements and move them up a bit and let's rename the first one to made by and the second one to practice finally we can create a button that will allow us to exit the game so I'm going to right click on the credits go UI and then button let's
