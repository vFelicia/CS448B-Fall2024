00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to the
00:05 - first video on creating a tower defense
00:07 - game in unity I'm really really excited
00:09 - about this video both because Tower
00:11 - Defense games are awesome to make it's
00:13 - really fun and I have a lot of stuff
00:15 - that I want to show you but also because
00:18 - this is the very first video I'm doing
00:20 - since going fulltime with Brees I'm
00:22 - Taking My Chances and investing all of
00:24 - my time into the channel That means that
00:26 - you will see more new content such as
00:29 - this and more content on the series we
00:32 - already have going such as the
00:33 - multiplayer FPS and the 2D platformer
00:36 - course so that's really really exciting
00:39 - and to make all of this possible I've
00:40 - started a patreon page because let's
00:42 - face it I do have to pay rent where you
00:45 - can donate monthly uh to support me on
00:48 - my mission and that's really exciting
00:51 - the um page itself looks like this you
00:54 - can click the screen now to be taking
00:56 - over here I offer some humble rewards uh
00:59 - in return and the first 20 or the first
01:02 - five people to donate $25 or more will
01:06 - get whatever project they're working on
01:08 - featured on Twitter Facebook and on the
01:11 - Forum so uh if you're excited about this
01:14 - just as I am you should go here and at
01:16 - least check it out if it's something for
01:18 - you I um I really appreciate it you no
01:21 - way forced to do this but it's awesome
01:24 - and thanks to the people who have
01:26 - already donated so without further Ado
01:28 - let's get right into today's video so
01:30 - I've opened up unity and I'm using
01:32 - version
01:34 - 5.3.5 but you can pretty much use any
01:36 - version that you want to it's not going
01:38 - to matter too much for what we are going
01:40 - to be doing so to create a new project
01:42 - we're going to hit new then we're going
01:44 - to type in the name of our project
01:46 - that's in my case going to be Tower
01:48 - Defense tutorial you can select the
01:50 - location and choose 3D and the reason
01:54 - why is I recently sent out a poll on
01:56 - Facebook and Twitter asking whether or
01:58 - not the series should be in 3D or 2D
02:00 - along with the question of what
02:02 - programming language we should be using
02:05 - and the result of the poll is on the
02:07 - screen now and that was of course 3D and
02:10 - C so that's what we're going to be doing
02:13 - and uh then hit create project which
02:15 - I've already done and opened it up in
02:17 - unity and then it should look like this
02:20 - so the first thing that I want to do
02:22 - here is populate our scene with some of
02:24 - the uh stuff that we are going to uh
02:26 - need in there and these some of these
02:29 - graphics might be temporary uh but it's
02:31 - great to get something uh in there that
02:34 - we can use and the basics of any tower
02:37 - defense game is some kind of start and
02:39 - end point for your enemies to walk from
02:42 - one to another and then a path that they
02:44 - take uh in getting there and also we
02:47 - need some place where we can place
02:49 - turrets in our case any turret is going
02:52 - to be placed on a platform that we call
02:55 - a node so let's go ahead and make a node
02:58 - right now so right click in the key go
03:00 - to 3D object select Cube then we're
03:03 - going to reset the
03:05 - transform do a scale of 4X
03:09 - 1x4 and then hit F to assume in on it so
03:14 - uh you can see here that we are going to
03:15 - keep the Box collider and the mes
03:17 - renderer that's all very fine and uh
03:20 - what we can then do is rename this one
03:22 - to node and drag it down to in the to
03:25 - the project to make it into a prefab
03:28 - then we can create an game object which
03:30 - we will also reset the transform on and
03:33 - rename to nodes and this is simply going
03:35 - to store all of our node uh all of our
03:38 - node objects as children so that's
03:41 - perfect what we can do now is we can
03:43 - simply duplicate this node then we can
03:46 - move it over using control and I'm going
03:49 - to leave a small space here and I just
03:52 - want a bunch of nodes here that will uh
03:56 - be a bunch of places that we can place
03:57 - turrets and also show the confines of
04:00 - our map so let's go ahead and make a
04:02 - grid of some of these notes and of
04:05 - course if you make your map too
04:07 - big uh it's going to be very slow uh
04:11 - this method of doing it that are
04:13 - optimizations that you can uh make but
04:16 - as long as you give your map a
04:19 - reasonable size it's really not going to
04:21 - be an issue especially because Unity has
04:23 - gotten so good at handling a lot of
04:26 - objects uh of the same type so let's
04:29 - select these two by holding down shift
04:31 - hit controll D to duplicate and holding
04:33 - down control again to move them over and
04:36 - keep doing this in shifting Direction so
04:38 - that we end up with a complete square
04:41 - and we I will just keep doing this just
04:44 - a few more times to get a map of a
04:47 - reasonable
04:49 - size and we can do this just once
04:53 - more here in this direction and one time
04:58 - in the other direction of course this if
05:00 - this is going to be a mobile game you
05:01 - will have to think more about
05:03 - performance but this here is going to be
05:06 - fine for any reasonable desktop it's
05:08 - going to be just fine so all of our
05:11 - notes are now in here and the good thing
05:12 - is that we made it into a prefab so if
05:14 - we change one all of them will change so
05:18 - what we can do now is simply collapse
05:20 - this noes here and then we will save our
05:22 - scene just to be on the safe side and
05:25 - I'm going to call this the main
05:28 - scene and what we can do is now specify
05:31 - a path for our enemies to walk along so
05:34 - I want our uh enemies to start up here
05:37 - so I'm going to select this node and
05:39 - delete it and end down here select that
05:42 - node and delete it and we will not do
05:44 - the same with any notes that these
05:46 - enemies should walk um uh over and then
05:51 - uh delete them and then instead create
05:53 - some kind of uh ground object that they
05:56 - will move along so let's go ahead and
05:58 - make a path by simply selecting objects
06:01 - here I want them to uh and again I'm
06:03 - holding down shift to do this I want
06:05 - them to um whoops that was a wrong
06:09 - one a the transform is getting in the
06:12 - way there so I want them to walk down
06:14 - there then over here and then up a bit
06:17 - then I want them to walk
06:19 - over and then take a path down again and
06:23 - this time I want them to go way down
06:26 - here over here and then
06:31 - around and we can make them go up a
06:35 - bit and
06:37 - over and up and
06:39 - over and then I want them to take the
06:42 - straight path down here to their final
06:46 - destination point so this is what my
06:49 - path is going to look like you can of
06:51 - course change yours to whatever you want
06:54 - uh and uh make different levels in this
06:57 - way so this is going to be the first
06:59 - first level and what I'm going to do now
07:01 - is create some ground objects to fill
07:04 - out these empty spaces so let's right
07:07 - click go to 3D object so that Cube again
07:10 - reset the Transformer on this and name
07:13 - this a ground object then we can go
07:16 - ahead and maybe move this over again
07:18 - holding down control make this a 4x4 by
07:22 - default you can watch it here zoom in on
07:25 - it by hitting F let's then create a new
07:28 - material for this so create material and
07:31 - call this one ground and we are going to
07:33 - drag it on there and then let's change
07:35 - the Albedo to something a bit more dark
07:38 - grayish then we can bump up the metallic
07:41 - just a bit and turn the smoothness all
07:44 - the way down to make it a very matte
07:46 - material so that looks kind of great and
07:50 - it's very clear that this note is
07:51 - different from the others so that's
07:53 - perfect and what we can then do is you
07:55 - can of course go with the same node
07:57 - design here but instead I simply want to
08:00 - scale up this node to fill out the
08:02 - entire path so in order to do this let's
08:04 - maybe move it over towards the center
08:06 - here of this small area of the path then
08:10 - we can instead of just scaling like this
08:13 - we can go in and choose edit snap
08:15 - settings and here we can adjust how uh
08:18 - our objects snap to the grid and in this
08:22 - case we want the scale to snap every one
08:24 - units so I'm going to scale it up here
08:28 - and it looks like like every one units
08:30 - actually wasn't perfect because now
08:32 - we're getting this offset which we don't
08:35 - want so let's choose point1 again here
08:38 - and then we can find adjust this so uh
08:41 - let's do that's actually too much so we
08:44 - can
08:45 - do1 or you can simply uh type in the
08:48 - correct uh number up here which I'm
08:50 - going to do so let's try uh 29 here
08:54 - whoops
08:55 - 29 and then move this over with a tool
09:00 - and it's still offset because our
09:02 - movement is now offset so what we can
09:04 - simply do is set the position here and
09:06 - you can see this right here is the X
09:08 - position to
09:11 - 17.5 and that's perfect so now it's
09:13 - snapped correctly and that looks fine
09:16 - then we can go ahead and duplicate this
09:17 - object rotate it by 90° move it down
09:21 - here again by holding down control and
09:23 - you can see again that this is snapped
09:26 - incorrectly so maybe we should set these
09:28 - to 05
09:29 - on the uh x and z so we can move it down
09:33 - there and then we can scale it in and I
09:36 - want to do this every 0.1
09:39 - units and move it over and you can just
09:42 - keep doing this to fill
09:44 - out the entire level something like that
09:47 - and then we can again duplicate this and
09:50 - rotate it
09:51 - back and I'm just going to do this to
09:54 - fill out the entire path and when I'm
09:56 - done uh I'm going to be
09:58 - back
10:02 - [Music]
10:05 - okay so I'm done creating our map and
10:06 - this looks just fine uh you could of
10:09 - course spend more time on this than I do
10:11 - but for the sake of the tutorial let's
10:13 - continue and let's start right click in
10:15 - the Hier ke to create another empty
10:17 - object and I'm just going to reset this
10:20 - and call this one
10:22 - environment and then we can take all of
10:24 - our ground objects and drag them into
10:26 - the environment and close that off just
10:29 - like that then let's create uh a object
10:32 - that will act as our starting point and
10:34 - one that will act as our ending point
10:36 - and again you know the procedure 3D
10:38 - object Cube reset it call this one start
10:42 - and I'm do going to do capital letters
10:44 - on this one and
10:47 - um yeah so that's fine and let's go
10:50 - ahead and add a material for this so uh
10:53 - actually the start Noe here needs to be
10:56 - 4 by 4 on the x and z as well and then
11:00 - I'm thinking for on the Y so what we can
11:03 - do with this is that we can actually
11:06 - move it up uh by
11:10 - 2.5 and then we can drag it
11:13 - over to stand on our ground here and I'm
11:16 - just going to drag it over so it stands
11:18 - correctly something like that and this
11:20 - is going to be the starting point so I
11:22 - think this looks just fine and uh what
11:25 - we can do with this is that we can then
11:27 - change the material so let's create a
11:29 - new material and this is going to be the
11:32 - start and I'm just going to drag that on
11:35 - there and then change the albo to
11:38 - something
11:40 - um let's see let's change this to
11:42 - something green uh so some kind of matte
11:46 - green I think that color there looks
11:48 - just fine let's again bump down the
11:50 - smoothness quite a bit and maybe just a
11:53 - bit of metallic no no metallic on this
11:55 - one and I don't want this to be uh to
11:59 - saturated so something like that looks
12:02 - pretty nice I think and then we can
12:04 - simply duplicate this node and then drag
12:06 - it over
12:08 - here and make this one our end node so
12:13 - there we go and this is going to be our
12:14 - end and we're going to create a separate
12:17 - material for this I'm just going to
12:18 - duplicate the start material and call
12:20 - this one end let's drag it on there as
12:24 - well and change the albo to something
12:27 - more red
12:29 - and we want this to be a bit more
12:31 - saturated so it's very clear that this
12:33 - is a red color great so it's going to
12:37 - walk from the start that's maybe just a
12:39 - bit too
12:41 - much something like that looks nice on
12:43 - my screen at least so uh it's going to
12:46 - walk from start and all the way along
12:48 - this path over to our end
12:51 - node and we should be able to uh remove
12:55 - the Box colliders on the start and end
12:57 - node along with the colliders on all of
12:59 - our ground objects so let's just remove
13:03 - the Box collider on those and if you are
13:05 - very smart you had made the ground
13:07 - object into a prefab I did not think
13:10 - about this you might as well do it if
13:12 - you haven't created them yet but for now
13:14 - unity's multiple object selection works
13:17 - just fine so uh let's save this scene
13:20 - and this is pretty much going to include
13:22 - the very first video on this uh in the
13:24 - next one we are going to make this scene
13:26 - come to uh life a bit more so I hope you
13:30 - enjoyed this video I hope that you're
13:31 - looking as much forward to future videos
13:34 - in this series as I am and again thanks
13:37 - to all of the amazing patreon supporters
13:40 - so thanks for watching the video and
13:42 - I'll see you in the next one thanks to
13:44 - all of the awesome patreon supporters
13:46 - who have donated so far and a special
13:48 - thanks to Lux game TV with the real name

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to the first video on creating a tower defense game in unity I'm really really excited about this video both because Tower Defense games are awesome to make it's really fun and I have a lot of stuff that I want to show you but also because this is the very first video I'm doing since going fulltime with Brees I'm Taking My Chances and investing all of my time into the channel That means that you will see more new content such as this and more content on the series we already have going such as the multiplayer FPS and the 2D platformer course so that's really really exciting and to make all of this possible I've started a patreon page because let's face it I do have to pay rent where you can donate monthly uh to support me on my mission and that's really exciting the um page itself looks like this you can click the screen now to be taking over here I offer some humble rewards uh in return and the first 20 or the first five people to donate $25 or more will get whatever project they're working on featured on Twitter Facebook and on the Forum so uh if you're excited about this just as I am you should go here and at least check it out if it's something for you I um I really appreciate it you no way forced to do this but it's awesome and thanks to the people who have already donated so without further Ado let's get right into today's video so I've opened up unity and I'm using version 5.3.5 but you can pretty much use any version that you want to it's not going to matter too much for what we are going to be doing so to create a new project we're going to hit new then we're going to type in the name of our project that's in my case going to be Tower Defense tutorial you can select the location and choose 3D and the reason why is I recently sent out a poll on Facebook and Twitter asking whether or not the series should be in 3D or 2D along with the question of what programming language we should be using and the result of the poll is on the screen now and that was of course 3D and C so that's what we're going to be doing and uh then hit create project which I've already done and opened it up in unity and then it should look like this so the first thing that I want to do here is populate our scene with some of the uh stuff that we are going to uh need in there and these some of these graphics might be temporary uh but it's great to get something uh in there that we can use and the basics of any tower defense game is some kind of start and end point for your enemies to walk from one to another and then a path that they take uh in getting there and also we need some place where we can place turrets in our case any turret is going to be placed on a platform that we call a node so let's go ahead and make a node right now so right click in the key go to 3D object select Cube then we're going to reset the transform do a scale of 4X 1x4 and then hit F to assume in on it so uh you can see here that we are going to keep the Box collider and the mes renderer that's all very fine and uh what we can then do is rename this one to node and drag it down to in the to the project to make it into a prefab then we can create an game object which we will also reset the transform on and rename to nodes and this is simply going to store all of our node uh all of our node objects as children so that's perfect what we can do now is we can simply duplicate this node then we can move it over using control and I'm going to leave a small space here and I just want a bunch of nodes here that will uh be a bunch of places that we can place turrets and also show the confines of our map so let's go ahead and make a grid of some of these notes and of course if you make your map too big uh it's going to be very slow uh this method of doing it that are optimizations that you can uh make but as long as you give your map a reasonable size it's really not going to be an issue especially because Unity has gotten so good at handling a lot of objects uh of the same type so let's select these two by holding down shift hit controll D to duplicate and holding down control again to move them over and keep doing this in shifting Direction so that we end up with a complete square and we I will just keep doing this just a few more times to get a map of a reasonable size and we can do this just once more here in this direction and one time in the other direction of course this if this is going to be a mobile game you will have to think more about performance but this here is going to be fine for any reasonable desktop it's going to be just fine so all of our notes are now in here and the good thing is that we made it into a prefab so if we change one all of them will change so what we can do now is simply collapse this noes here and then we will save our scene just to be on the safe side and I'm going to call this the main scene and what we can do is now specify a path for our enemies to walk along so I want our uh enemies to start up here so I'm going to select this node and delete it and end down here select that node and delete it and we will not do the same with any notes that these enemies should walk um uh over and then uh delete them and then instead create some kind of uh ground object that they will move along so let's go ahead and make a path by simply selecting objects here I want them to uh and again I'm holding down shift to do this I want them to um whoops that was a wrong one a the transform is getting in the way there so I want them to walk down there then over here and then up a bit then I want them to walk over and then take a path down again and this time I want them to go way down here over here and then around and we can make them go up a bit and over and up and over and then I want them to take the straight path down here to their final destination point so this is what my path is going to look like you can of course change yours to whatever you want uh and uh make different levels in this way so this is going to be the first first level and what I'm going to do now is create some ground objects to fill out these empty spaces so let's right click go to 3D object so that Cube again reset the Transformer on this and name this a ground object then we can go ahead and maybe move this over again holding down control make this a 4x4 by default you can watch it here zoom in on it by hitting F let's then create a new material for this so create material and call this one ground and we are going to drag it on there and then let's change the Albedo to something a bit more dark grayish then we can bump up the metallic just a bit and turn the smoothness all the way down to make it a very matte material so that looks kind of great and it's very clear that this note is different from the others so that's perfect and what we can then do is you can of course go with the same node design here but instead I simply want to scale up this node to fill out the entire path so in order to do this let's maybe move it over towards the center here of this small area of the path then we can instead of just scaling like this we can go in and choose edit snap settings and here we can adjust how uh our objects snap to the grid and in this case we want the scale to snap every one units so I'm going to scale it up here and it looks like like every one units actually wasn't perfect because now we're getting this offset which we don't want so let's choose point1 again here and then we can find adjust this so uh let's do that's actually too much so we can do1 or you can simply uh type in the correct uh number up here which I'm going to do so let's try uh 29 here whoops 29 and then move this over with a tool and it's still offset because our movement is now offset so what we can simply do is set the position here and you can see this right here is the X position to 17.5 and that's perfect so now it's snapped correctly and that looks fine then we can go ahead and duplicate this object rotate it by 90° move it down here again by holding down control and you can see again that this is snapped incorrectly so maybe we should set these to 05 on the uh x and z so we can move it down there and then we can scale it in and I want to do this every 0.1 units and move it over and you can just keep doing this to fill out the entire level something like that and then we can again duplicate this and rotate it back and I'm just going to do this to fill out the entire path and when I'm done uh I'm going to be back okay so I'm done creating our map and this looks just fine uh you could of course spend more time on this than I do but for the sake of the tutorial let's continue and let's start right click in the Hier ke to create another empty object and I'm just going to reset this and call this one environment and then we can take all of our ground objects and drag them into the environment and close that off just like that then let's create uh a object that will act as our starting point and one that will act as our ending point and again you know the procedure 3D object Cube reset it call this one start and I'm do going to do capital letters on this one and um yeah so that's fine and let's go ahead and add a material for this so uh actually the start Noe here needs to be 4 by 4 on the x and z as well and then I'm thinking for on the Y so what we can do with this is that we can actually move it up uh by 2.5 and then we can drag it over to stand on our ground here and I'm just going to drag it over so it stands correctly something like that and this is going to be the starting point so I think this looks just fine and uh what we can do with this is that we can then change the material so let's create a new material and this is going to be the start and I'm just going to drag that on there and then change the albo to something um let's see let's change this to something green uh so some kind of matte green I think that color there looks just fine let's again bump down the smoothness quite a bit and maybe just a bit of metallic no no metallic on this one and I don't want this to be uh to saturated so something like that looks pretty nice I think and then we can simply duplicate this node and then drag it over here and make this one our end node so there we go and this is going to be our end and we're going to create a separate material for this I'm just going to duplicate the start material and call this one end let's drag it on there as well and change the albo to something more red and we want this to be a bit more saturated so it's very clear that this is a red color great so it's going to walk from the start that's maybe just a bit too much something like that looks nice on my screen at least so uh it's going to walk from start and all the way along this path over to our end node and we should be able to uh remove the Box colliders on the start and end node along with the colliders on all of our ground objects so let's just remove the Box collider on those and if you are very smart you had made the ground object into a prefab I did not think about this you might as well do it if you haven't created them yet but for now unity's multiple object selection works just fine so uh let's save this scene and this is pretty much going to include the very first video on this uh in the next one we are going to make this scene come to uh life a bit more so I hope you enjoyed this video I hope that you're looking as much forward to future videos in this series as I am and again thanks to all of the amazing patreon supporters so thanks for watching the video and I'll see you in the next one thanks to all of the awesome patreon supporters who have donated so far and a special thanks to Lux game TV with the real name Jeff sred
