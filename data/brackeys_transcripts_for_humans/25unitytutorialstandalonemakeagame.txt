00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number 25 and make a
00:06 - game a closed series I'm making a video
00:09 - game in unity so in today's video we're
00:12 - going to take a look at exporting our
00:14 - game to a standalone application that
00:17 - means that we will build our game for
00:19 - both Windows and Mac and in this video
00:22 - we'll take the windows files and turn
00:25 - them into an installer an actual setup
00:28 - file and we'll have an uninstall file
00:30 - and all of that cool stuff and also we
00:34 - are are able to build the app the Mac
00:37 - application on a Windows computer here
00:40 - so I'll show you how to do that also
00:42 - and the process is the same on a Mac and
00:44 - I'll talk a bit about what you'll
00:46 - typically do with the application on a
00:49 - Mac once you've build it and yeah that's
00:53 - basically all for the intro I will
00:55 - mention however that I will also be
00:57 - doing a tutorial on exporting for the
01:00 - web so if you want to have a web-based
01:03 - game I'll show you how to do that too
01:06 - but that's for a future video and as
01:08 - always if you have any questions go to
01:10 - firmed up branches comm you can find
01:13 - many answers there cool so as always
01:17 - let's open up a unity and you can see
01:19 - I've updated to unity 5.2 and lots of
01:24 - cool stuff in this update most notably
01:27 - we now have the unity services
01:31 - integrated into the unity editor as you
01:33 - can see by the cloud symbol up here but
01:36 - that's not something we're going to be
01:38 - using today since it's also pro only for
01:42 - a lot of the stuff but first a thing we
01:45 - want to do here is simply select the
01:47 - icon that we created in the last
01:49 - tutorial and we want to change the
01:51 - settings around here bit because if you
01:53 - remember in the last tutorial when we
01:55 - build our game just to ted test it out
01:58 - the icon look really blurry and
02:01 - sometimes you can force windows to
02:04 - update the icon and make it look sharp
02:08 - again by simply moving it into another
02:10 - folder or restarting and something like
02:13 - that
02:13 - and but I found that the settings that
02:16 - work best for creating a sharp icon on
02:19 - Windows and and will work most of the
02:22 - time if we if we actually change this
02:24 - back to editor Korean legacy GUI and
02:27 - change the filter mode to try a linear
02:29 - you will also make want to make sure
02:31 - that the format is set to true color
02:33 - that's it I plan that that this is
02:36 - something that's constantly changing and
02:38 - it's kind of annoying that you can
02:40 - always be sure that your icon will look
02:42 - great but I find that these settings
02:46 - actually work the best cool so now we
02:51 - want to go to a file and then build
02:53 - settings or ctrl shift B and the first
02:56 - thing we want to make sure is that all
02:58 - of the scenes we want to have in our
03:00 - game are added to the scenes inbuilt
03:02 - list and if you're using uh if you're
03:06 - loading scenes dependent on an index you
03:09 - will also make want to make sure that
03:11 - these scenes are in correct order so
03:14 - here you can see we go from the main
03:16 - menu to level 1 to level 2 and then to
03:19 - an end level scene cool so down here you
03:27 - can see a list of all of the different
03:29 - platforms that unity supports today we
03:32 - of course going to be looking at the PC
03:34 - Mac and Linux standalone and you will
03:37 - want to check if there is a unity icon
03:39 - to the right of the name here and you
03:41 - can see on mine that is yours might be
03:45 - on one of the other platforms and if
03:48 - that is the case you want to select the
03:49 - PC Mac and Linux stand alone and hit
03:51 - switch platform this will force the
03:54 - unity editor to use settings that works
04:00 - with the on platform selected and it
04:04 - might take a little while to do then
04:07 - also you can see the target platform
04:09 - here we have three choices today we are
04:12 - going to be ignoring Linux and I'm sorry
04:15 - Linux users I like in Linux too but not
04:18 - today
04:19 - and let's start out by exporting for the
04:22 - Mac here so simply select the Mac OS X
04:25 - under the architecture you can
04:28 - the 32-bit which is x86 or you can
04:35 - choose 64-bit which is this one or the
04:40 - universal one most of the time you are
04:42 - going to be just fine using the 32-bit
04:45 - version you can of course have multiple
04:49 - architecture versions for your program
04:51 - this is completely up to you
04:54 - if you don't have a clue about of what
04:57 - I'm saying simply use the 32-bit one
05:01 - most modern machines today support the
05:03 - 64-bit but if you want to make sure that
05:07 - all of your friends can play in this on
05:09 - all that computers simply select a t6 or
05:12 - 32-bit and we want to uncheck
05:16 - development build here because this is
05:18 - going to be our final build and then we
05:20 - want to go into the player settings and
05:22 - just make sure that all of this is
05:23 - correct so the company name should be
05:25 - Brad keys in my instance the product
05:27 - name is just going to be mega game and
05:30 - then we have the default icon you of
05:33 - course want to drag this in there if it
05:36 - isn't already and down here you can see
05:38 - we have a bunch of different tabs for
05:40 - the different platforms and this is the
05:42 - standalone tab so we want to check or
05:46 - change these settings depending on what
05:48 - we want to do well first off default
05:51 - this full screen is fine for me I think
05:53 - this game is fine in full screen default
05:57 - is native resolution that's definitely
05:59 - something you want to check most of the
06:01 - time and I'll allow this to run in
06:05 - background other than that capture
06:10 - single screen that can be be ignored I
06:13 - want to display the resolution dialog
06:15 - because we haven't actually made a
06:17 - resolution setting option inside of the
06:20 - game so the resolution dialog is is the
06:24 - small window that pops up before you
06:27 - start your game that allows you to
06:29 - change resolution quality settings and
06:33 - controls so I'll just enable that use
06:37 - player log is
06:41 - if that's checked unity will actually
06:43 - store debug log statement in a log file
06:46 - so you can view them afterwards
06:48 - this is not something most of you are
06:50 - going to be using but you can leave it
06:53 - there resizable window I'm not going to
06:56 - check that and Mac App Store validation
07:00 - now let's talk about how you distribute
07:02 - software on Mac well if you want to
07:07 - release your game on Mac and you're
07:10 - going to of course build this and you'll
07:12 - get get an app file and an app file is
07:16 - basically just it looks like a single
07:20 - file but if you right-click it you can
07:22 - actually view all of its contents and
07:26 - and it actually consists of a bunch of
07:29 - sub folders and sub files but the app
07:33 - file in itself is not something that you
07:37 - want to be distributing instead you can
07:40 - either you upload this to a website of
07:42 - yours or Dropbox or some kind of file
07:44 - sharing site and in order to do that you
07:48 - will need to wrap it in a disk image
07:52 - file and this standard here is what I
07:55 - call what is called a dot dmg file and
07:58 - if that's something you want to do and
08:00 - that's something most programs are uses
08:03 - on Mac and then I'll have a link in the
08:06 - description that you can follow that
08:08 - will show you how to package it in a dmg
08:11 - file and that simply means that you
08:13 - download a file from wherever you've
08:15 - stored it you open it and it will prompt
08:18 - you to either run the application
08:20 - directly from the disk image or simply
08:23 - drag it into the Applications folder
08:25 - it's something you've probably done a
08:27 - bunch of time without thinking about it
08:30 - but that's an option or you can of
08:33 - course publish it on the Mac App Store
08:35 - and if that's something you want to do
08:39 - and that's something a lot of people
08:40 - will want to do because then you can
08:43 - easily give a price for your game and
08:48 - you also don't need
08:50 - need a website or any dedicated place
08:53 - for people to download it you can simply
08:55 - use the pre-made app store well then you
09:01 - want to check this option right here and
09:04 - basically what this does is it will make
09:06 - sure that if your game is not downloaded
09:08 - from the App Store well then it's not
09:11 - going to be able to be run so that's
09:14 - something you'll want to check if you
09:15 - have plans about publishing to the App
09:18 - Store then you have the full screen mode
09:20 - this should be a pretty self-explanatory
09:22 - a full screen window with menu by and
09:25 - dark will be fine I think and these two
09:30 - can be ignored visible in background
09:33 - don't want that and I think it's fine
09:35 - that you can run multiple instances of
09:37 - this and I think our game currently
09:40 - supports should support all aspect
09:43 - ratios so these are resolution screen
09:45 - arrest ratios and I think that all of
09:50 - them should be fine here you can of
09:51 - course limit that if you want to then we
09:54 - dig into the icon and you can override
09:56 - some of these if you want to but they
09:59 - should be fine just using a single one
10:02 - this splash image here you can use a
10:09 - custom dialog banner and that means that
10:12 - when we run the game
10:14 - the resolution dialog will pop up and
10:17 - that has the possibility for you to put
10:20 - in an a custom image there that has
10:23 - something to do with your game and this
10:25 - is where you would want to drag that in
10:27 - I don't we're not going to be doing that
10:29 - in this tutorial and I will just
10:31 - continue then undo other settings this
10:35 - is a bit more advanced and can just be
10:37 - completely ignored so basically that was
10:40 - everything we need to set up and think
10:42 - about before building so now we can go
10:45 - and do build and you can see that under
10:47 - our mega game project I've made a folder
10:50 - called builds and inside of this I think
10:53 - we should make a subfolder called
10:55 - Mac
10:57 - and then here we can simply actually
11:01 - will make another subfolder called
11:04 - x86 so 32-bit and we can simply call
11:10 - this make a game and then x86 cool and
11:19 - you can see it saves it as a dot app and
11:22 - what this means is that if you're
11:23 - viewing this on a Mac you will see this
11:27 - answer file as an application that you
11:29 - can run but when we are viewing this on
11:31 - Windows we simply see it as a folder
11:34 - with a bunch of subfolders and this was
11:36 - what I was talking about so there are a
11:38 - bunch of stuff inside of all of these
11:42 - cool so now that we have that done the
11:46 - process is exactly the same for 62 bit
11:50 - or 64 bit and you should be able to
11:54 - simply export for other Mac versions
11:57 - there again either to upload it to the
12:00 - App Store or check out the guy guide in
12:03 - the description on making wrapping this
12:07 - in a disk image so you can easily upload
12:10 - it to any file sharing side of your
12:13 - choice next up is Windows cool so let's
12:17 - go ahead and change the target platform
12:19 - here to Windows and again you can either
12:22 - select 32 bit which is 86 or 64 bit
12:26 - which is this one down here and for now
12:30 - I'm simply going to export to 32-bit
12:32 - because then our program is going to be
12:34 - supported by all computers you can of
12:39 - course have to download links on your
12:41 - site one for 32 and one for 64 then we
12:45 - want to go and hit and again we can go
12:49 - into the player settings here and just
12:52 - check that everything is as we want it
12:54 - to be and this is just something you
12:56 - should double check here and then we can
12:58 - go ahead and hit build and we can go on
13:01 - the builds create a new folder called
13:05 - windows
13:07 - create a new subfolder called 86 and
13:13 - then name this make a game x86 and it's
13:26 - going to go ahead and build this and
13:28 - once it's built it's going to open up
13:30 - here you can see that our icon is now
13:32 - looking much sharper than it did before
13:34 - even though we are making this huge you
13:37 - can see it's very very sharp cool so
13:42 - what we can do now is we can go ahead
13:44 - and make this into an installer you can
13:46 - of course create a 64 bit version but
13:49 - we'll just go ahead and make an
13:50 - installer out of this so now we can
13:53 - actually close down unity I'll simply
13:55 - minimize unity here and what we can do
13:59 - is we can use a program called Ino setup
14:04 - so I NN o setup and if you don't have
14:09 - this already we can go on the web here
14:11 - and search for you know setup here and
14:16 - this is a very good program actually and
14:19 - it's also free for creating installers
14:22 - of a bunch of files and it's fairly
14:27 - simple to use and it offers a lot of
14:30 - customization you can actually make your
14:33 - own scripts and edit these in order to
14:37 - configure exactly how you want your
14:40 - installer to look and what text you want
14:43 - and how you want it to compress your
14:46 - files you can do so much stuff with this
14:50 - but we assume we're going to take the
14:53 - fat assembly fairly simple right route
14:56 - and simply download the you know setup
14:58 - here and then go and do stable release
15:01 - and download the X file XE file here so
15:06 - simply hit random side then you'll get
15:08 - the executable and simply run that and
15:10 - install it once it's downloaded then we
15:15 - can go down here and run a no setup
15:18 - compiler and it's going to prompt you to
15:21 - either open an existing script file or
15:25 - we can create an empty script file or
15:28 - create a new script file using the
15:31 - script wizard so basically in a setup
15:34 - uses these scripts that will compile
15:37 - your program into a setup file and
15:40 - they've made this useful wizard if we
15:44 - don't want to make everything by hand so
15:47 - now we can simply hit next and we can
15:49 - give our application and name and this
15:52 - is going to be make again and this is
15:54 - version 1.0 from brad keys and you can
15:58 - also input a website here and i'm simply
16:01 - going to do wwww stack-on then hit next
16:05 - and last i'm they want these to be
16:08 - installed in the Program Files folder
16:10 - under the application for the name we
16:13 - are going to select make a game and we
16:16 - are going to allow user other users to
16:20 - change the application folder if they
16:22 - want to then let's hit next and now we
16:26 - want to basically find the files on a
16:29 - system that we want the installer to
16:31 - install so let's hit browse here and
16:34 - let's find on our system the executable
16:38 - that we just built so - under is on the
16:44 - Dropbox and then make a game builds
16:48 - Windows 86 and there it is so simply
16:52 - select that and now this is maybe a bit
16:57 - funky but you are going to have to
17:00 - create another folder to store this data
17:03 - folder in because what we are going to
17:06 - write now we've only associated the EXCI
17:08 - file we also want to associate the data
17:11 - folder but when we add that in here it
17:16 - actually doesn't include the folder
17:21 - itself it just extracts all of these
17:24 - files at the same level as
17:27 - to make a game file and therefore we
17:31 - need to create a folder to wrap this in
17:34 - so we'll simply copy the name here and
17:37 - then create a folder and we'll simply
17:40 - call this data and then we'll drag the
17:43 - mega game 86 data into this data folder
17:46 - and rename this to exactly the same so
17:49 - now when we open this we see another
17:52 - folder with the same name and inside of
17:54 - that is all of that data so you can see
17:55 - what the hierarchy looks up like up here
17:59 - so what we then do is in here we say
18:03 - that we want the user to start the
18:06 - application after setup has finished if
18:08 - you want to and then we hit add folder
18:12 - down here we navigate to the place where
18:15 - we have stored this so again this is for
18:18 - me under Dropbox then make a game and
18:21 - builds Windows 86 and then we want to
18:26 - select the parent folder here it's very
18:29 - important that you don't select the
18:30 - subfolder but the parent folder because
18:34 - then when this is extracted this folder
18:38 - is what is going to be lying alongside
18:40 - our executable so simply select that and
18:44 - hit yes to this because we want to
18:48 - include all subfolders and now we hit
18:50 - next and yeah fine we'll make a Start
18:54 - menu folder called
18:55 - make a game and we'll allow the user to
18:58 - change this folder name to disable the
19:01 - the creation of that create an uninstall
19:04 - icon in that folder and we also want to
19:08 - allow the user to create a desktop icon
19:10 - you can change these settings like you
19:13 - want to then we have the possibility to
19:16 - attach a license file or some
19:20 - information files shown before and after
19:23 - installation so if you want to make some
19:25 - custom text saying thank you for
19:28 - downloading and you can check out our
19:30 - github page here and this was made using
19:33 - practice tutorials and then a link feel
19:36 - free to do that
19:38 - but just know that the license files are
19:41 - in the files that you attach here need
19:44 - to be in either dot txt or dot RTF
19:47 - format and they are of course a
19:49 - completely optional so I'm just going to
19:52 - hit next then you can select what
19:54 - languages you want this installer to
19:57 - include and I'm simply going to use
20:00 - English here but you can use select all
20:02 - and just allow that to automatically
20:05 - translate itself then hit next here and
20:08 - now we want to choose the folder where
20:12 - we want our setup file to be compiled to
20:15 - so let's go under browse here and I'm
20:18 - going to go under find our Dropbox
20:21 - folder here the make game folder should
20:25 - be here there and go and do it builds
20:28 - windows and actually instead of yeah
20:34 - builds windows and then make a new
20:37 - folder here and call this installer okay
20:44 - and let's rename this to make a game
20:49 - setup and then we'll do 86 and we can
20:55 - maybe grab that in parenthesis cool and
21:05 - then you can change choose a custom
21:08 - setup icon file I think we're just going
21:10 - to use the default one and set a
21:12 - password if that's something you want to
21:14 - do I'm just going to hit next and finish
21:17 - and you can see that in our setup
21:20 - compiler now creates this cool-looking
21:24 - scripts with all of our settings you can
21:26 - see that our whoops sorry about that you
21:29 - can see that our app name is mega game
21:31 - our app version 1.0 it has references to
21:34 - all the files that we're going to be
21:36 - needing and and that's super cool it's
21:39 - basically done all of this for us
21:41 - and the cool thing about the way that it
21:44 - sets it up here is if we've made us sing
21:47 - a small mistake along the way we can
21:50 - simply go into the script and
21:51 - by hand we don't need to go through the
21:54 - entire process again so now we would
21:57 - like to compile the script so simply hit
22:00 - yes to this and I don't think we want to
22:03 - save the script anywhere you can do that
22:05 - actually let's just save this so in
22:07 - under your windows and then installer we
22:10 - can simply save this as make a game
22:15 - installer compilation or compiler
22:21 - installer compile installer script we
22:29 - could do something like that so then you
22:31 - have it and you can always open it and
22:33 - make a small change and then compile or
22:36 - create this setup file again so let's
22:39 - hit save on that and it's going to start
22:41 - compiling and if we go under builds
22:43 - Windows installer you can see that we
22:46 - now have the script here which you can
22:48 - open up and change
22:50 - that's this script here and we also have
22:53 - the exe we have the executable setup
22:56 - file and this is what you would then
22:57 - upload to a web server or to mediafire
23:01 - and share with your friends because if
23:03 - we run this now simply double click that
23:06 - and give it permission you can see we
23:09 - get this cool-looking Installer welcome
23:11 - to the make it game setup wizard then
23:13 - this will install make a game version
23:15 - 1.0 on your computer you can see that it
23:17 - creates all of this text for us we have
23:20 - the title here we can go next you can
23:23 - choose a custom place to install your
23:25 - game go Next again here and that's the
23:28 - Start menu folder and we can not create
23:30 - that or create that and then hit next
23:33 - and we want to also create a desktop
23:35 - icon next again and install and it's
23:39 - going to quickly install a lot of stuff
23:40 - and now we can launch the mega game
23:42 - immediately here I'm just going to
23:44 - uncheck that to show you that it's now
23:46 - on the desktop here as a shortcut it's
23:49 - also in the Start menu here on the
23:52 - recently added and if we go and open the
23:56 - file location you can see that our mega
23:59 - game XE executable is here our data is
24:02 - here that's also an
24:05 - uninstalled EXCI so if you want to
24:07 - uninstall this program you can simply
24:10 - run this and now we can simply double
24:13 - click make a game to open it up and you
24:16 - can see we have our display dialog er
24:21 - resolution dialog with the banner that
24:23 - you've input that you've set if you have
24:28 - said any banner I don't think it's
24:30 - necessary this is just a formality kind
24:33 - of but you can of course put something
24:36 - cool-looking there and now we can hit
24:38 - play and enjoy our game as installed by
24:42 - I in our system so we can now hit play
24:47 - game here and play through ok so it's
24:51 - actually that easy so that's basically
24:54 - all I wanted to cover in this video I
24:57 - hope you enjoyed it and I'm definitely
25:00 - looking forward to showing how you can
25:02 - export your game to a web-based platform
25:06 - as well so again thanks for watching and
25:09 - I'll see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to video number 25 and make a game a closed series I'm making a video game in unity so in today's video we're going to take a look at exporting our game to a standalone application that means that we will build our game for both Windows and Mac and in this video we'll take the windows files and turn them into an installer an actual setup file and we'll have an uninstall file and all of that cool stuff and also we are are able to build the app the Mac application on a Windows computer here so I'll show you how to do that also and the process is the same on a Mac and I'll talk a bit about what you'll typically do with the application on a Mac once you've build it and yeah that's basically all for the intro I will mention however that I will also be doing a tutorial on exporting for the web so if you want to have a webbased game I'll show you how to do that too but that's for a future video and as always if you have any questions go to firmed up branches comm you can find many answers there cool so as always let's open up a unity and you can see I've updated to unity 5.2 and lots of cool stuff in this update most notably we now have the unity services integrated into the unity editor as you can see by the cloud symbol up here but that's not something we're going to be using today since it's also pro only for a lot of the stuff but first a thing we want to do here is simply select the icon that we created in the last tutorial and we want to change the settings around here bit because if you remember in the last tutorial when we build our game just to ted test it out the icon look really blurry and sometimes you can force windows to update the icon and make it look sharp again by simply moving it into another folder or restarting and something like that and but I found that the settings that work best for creating a sharp icon on Windows and and will work most of the time if we if we actually change this back to editor Korean legacy GUI and change the filter mode to try a linear you will also make want to make sure that the format is set to true color that's it I plan that that this is something that's constantly changing and it's kind of annoying that you can always be sure that your icon will look great but I find that these settings actually work the best cool so now we want to go to a file and then build settings or ctrl shift B and the first thing we want to make sure is that all of the scenes we want to have in our game are added to the scenes inbuilt list and if you're using uh if you're loading scenes dependent on an index you will also make want to make sure that these scenes are in correct order so here you can see we go from the main menu to level 1 to level 2 and then to an end level scene cool so down here you can see a list of all of the different platforms that unity supports today we of course going to be looking at the PC Mac and Linux standalone and you will want to check if there is a unity icon to the right of the name here and you can see on mine that is yours might be on one of the other platforms and if that is the case you want to select the PC Mac and Linux stand alone and hit switch platform this will force the unity editor to use settings that works with the on platform selected and it might take a little while to do then also you can see the target platform here we have three choices today we are going to be ignoring Linux and I'm sorry Linux users I like in Linux too but not today and let's start out by exporting for the Mac here so simply select the Mac OS X under the architecture you can the 32bit which is x86 or you can choose 64bit which is this one or the universal one most of the time you are going to be just fine using the 32bit version you can of course have multiple architecture versions for your program this is completely up to you if you don't have a clue about of what I'm saying simply use the 32bit one most modern machines today support the 64bit but if you want to make sure that all of your friends can play in this on all that computers simply select a t6 or 32bit and we want to uncheck development build here because this is going to be our final build and then we want to go into the player settings and just make sure that all of this is correct so the company name should be Brad keys in my instance the product name is just going to be mega game and then we have the default icon you of course want to drag this in there if it isn't already and down here you can see we have a bunch of different tabs for the different platforms and this is the standalone tab so we want to check or change these settings depending on what we want to do well first off default this full screen is fine for me I think this game is fine in full screen default is native resolution that's definitely something you want to check most of the time and I'll allow this to run in background other than that capture single screen that can be be ignored I want to display the resolution dialog because we haven't actually made a resolution setting option inside of the game so the resolution dialog is is the small window that pops up before you start your game that allows you to change resolution quality settings and controls so I'll just enable that use player log is if that's checked unity will actually store debug log statement in a log file so you can view them afterwards this is not something most of you are going to be using but you can leave it there resizable window I'm not going to check that and Mac App Store validation now let's talk about how you distribute software on Mac well if you want to release your game on Mac and you're going to of course build this and you'll get get an app file and an app file is basically just it looks like a single file but if you rightclick it you can actually view all of its contents and and it actually consists of a bunch of sub folders and sub files but the app file in itself is not something that you want to be distributing instead you can either you upload this to a website of yours or Dropbox or some kind of file sharing site and in order to do that you will need to wrap it in a disk image file and this standard here is what I call what is called a dot dmg file and if that's something you want to do and that's something most programs are uses on Mac and then I'll have a link in the description that you can follow that will show you how to package it in a dmg file and that simply means that you download a file from wherever you've stored it you open it and it will prompt you to either run the application directly from the disk image or simply drag it into the Applications folder it's something you've probably done a bunch of time without thinking about it but that's an option or you can of course publish it on the Mac App Store and if that's something you want to do and that's something a lot of people will want to do because then you can easily give a price for your game and you also don't need need a website or any dedicated place for people to download it you can simply use the premade app store well then you want to check this option right here and basically what this does is it will make sure that if your game is not downloaded from the App Store well then it's not going to be able to be run so that's something you'll want to check if you have plans about publishing to the App Store then you have the full screen mode this should be a pretty selfexplanatory a full screen window with menu by and dark will be fine I think and these two can be ignored visible in background don't want that and I think it's fine that you can run multiple instances of this and I think our game currently supports should support all aspect ratios so these are resolution screen arrest ratios and I think that all of them should be fine here you can of course limit that if you want to then we dig into the icon and you can override some of these if you want to but they should be fine just using a single one this splash image here you can use a custom dialog banner and that means that when we run the game the resolution dialog will pop up and that has the possibility for you to put in an a custom image there that has something to do with your game and this is where you would want to drag that in I don't we're not going to be doing that in this tutorial and I will just continue then undo other settings this is a bit more advanced and can just be completely ignored so basically that was everything we need to set up and think about before building so now we can go and do build and you can see that under our mega game project I've made a folder called builds and inside of this I think we should make a subfolder called Mac and then here we can simply actually will make another subfolder called x86 so 32bit and we can simply call this make a game and then x86 cool and you can see it saves it as a dot app and what this means is that if you're viewing this on a Mac you will see this answer file as an application that you can run but when we are viewing this on Windows we simply see it as a folder with a bunch of subfolders and this was what I was talking about so there are a bunch of stuff inside of all of these cool so now that we have that done the process is exactly the same for 62 bit or 64 bit and you should be able to simply export for other Mac versions there again either to upload it to the App Store or check out the guy guide in the description on making wrapping this in a disk image so you can easily upload it to any file sharing side of your choice next up is Windows cool so let's go ahead and change the target platform here to Windows and again you can either select 32 bit which is 86 or 64 bit which is this one down here and for now I'm simply going to export to 32bit because then our program is going to be supported by all computers you can of course have to download links on your site one for 32 and one for 64 then we want to go and hit and again we can go into the player settings here and just check that everything is as we want it to be and this is just something you should double check here and then we can go ahead and hit build and we can go on the builds create a new folder called windows create a new subfolder called 86 and then name this make a game x86 and it's going to go ahead and build this and once it's built it's going to open up here you can see that our icon is now looking much sharper than it did before even though we are making this huge you can see it's very very sharp cool so what we can do now is we can go ahead and make this into an installer you can of course create a 64 bit version but we'll just go ahead and make an installer out of this so now we can actually close down unity I'll simply minimize unity here and what we can do is we can use a program called Ino setup so I NN o setup and if you don't have this already we can go on the web here and search for you know setup here and this is a very good program actually and it's also free for creating installers of a bunch of files and it's fairly simple to use and it offers a lot of customization you can actually make your own scripts and edit these in order to configure exactly how you want your installer to look and what text you want and how you want it to compress your files you can do so much stuff with this but we assume we're going to take the fat assembly fairly simple right route and simply download the you know setup here and then go and do stable release and download the X file XE file here so simply hit random side then you'll get the executable and simply run that and install it once it's downloaded then we can go down here and run a no setup compiler and it's going to prompt you to either open an existing script file or we can create an empty script file or create a new script file using the script wizard so basically in a setup uses these scripts that will compile your program into a setup file and they've made this useful wizard if we don't want to make everything by hand so now we can simply hit next and we can give our application and name and this is going to be make again and this is version 1.0 from brad keys and you can also input a website here and i'm simply going to do wwww stackon then hit next and last i'm they want these to be installed in the Program Files folder under the application for the name we are going to select make a game and we are going to allow user other users to change the application folder if they want to then let's hit next and now we want to basically find the files on a system that we want the installer to install so let's hit browse here and let's find on our system the executable that we just built so under is on the Dropbox and then make a game builds Windows 86 and there it is so simply select that and now this is maybe a bit funky but you are going to have to create another folder to store this data folder in because what we are going to write now we've only associated the EXCI file we also want to associate the data folder but when we add that in here it actually doesn't include the folder itself it just extracts all of these files at the same level as to make a game file and therefore we need to create a folder to wrap this in so we'll simply copy the name here and then create a folder and we'll simply call this data and then we'll drag the mega game 86 data into this data folder and rename this to exactly the same so now when we open this we see another folder with the same name and inside of that is all of that data so you can see what the hierarchy looks up like up here so what we then do is in here we say that we want the user to start the application after setup has finished if you want to and then we hit add folder down here we navigate to the place where we have stored this so again this is for me under Dropbox then make a game and builds Windows 86 and then we want to select the parent folder here it's very important that you don't select the subfolder but the parent folder because then when this is extracted this folder is what is going to be lying alongside our executable so simply select that and hit yes to this because we want to include all subfolders and now we hit next and yeah fine we'll make a Start menu folder called make a game and we'll allow the user to change this folder name to disable the the creation of that create an uninstall icon in that folder and we also want to allow the user to create a desktop icon you can change these settings like you want to then we have the possibility to attach a license file or some information files shown before and after installation so if you want to make some custom text saying thank you for downloading and you can check out our github page here and this was made using practice tutorials and then a link feel free to do that but just know that the license files are in the files that you attach here need to be in either dot txt or dot RTF format and they are of course a completely optional so I'm just going to hit next then you can select what languages you want this installer to include and I'm simply going to use English here but you can use select all and just allow that to automatically translate itself then hit next here and now we want to choose the folder where we want our setup file to be compiled to so let's go under browse here and I'm going to go under find our Dropbox folder here the make game folder should be here there and go and do it builds windows and actually instead of yeah builds windows and then make a new folder here and call this installer okay and let's rename this to make a game setup and then we'll do 86 and we can maybe grab that in parenthesis cool and then you can change choose a custom setup icon file I think we're just going to use the default one and set a password if that's something you want to do I'm just going to hit next and finish and you can see that in our setup compiler now creates this coollooking scripts with all of our settings you can see that our whoops sorry about that you can see that our app name is mega game our app version 1.0 it has references to all the files that we're going to be needing and and that's super cool it's basically done all of this for us and the cool thing about the way that it sets it up here is if we've made us sing a small mistake along the way we can simply go into the script and by hand we don't need to go through the entire process again so now we would like to compile the script so simply hit yes to this and I don't think we want to save the script anywhere you can do that actually let's just save this so in under your windows and then installer we can simply save this as make a game installer compilation or compiler installer compile installer script we could do something like that so then you have it and you can always open it and make a small change and then compile or create this setup file again so let's hit save on that and it's going to start compiling and if we go under builds Windows installer you can see that we now have the script here which you can open up and change that's this script here and we also have the exe we have the executable setup file and this is what you would then upload to a web server or to mediafire and share with your friends because if we run this now simply double click that and give it permission you can see we get this coollooking Installer welcome to the make it game setup wizard then this will install make a game version 1.0 on your computer you can see that it creates all of this text for us we have the title here we can go next you can choose a custom place to install your game go Next again here and that's the Start menu folder and we can not create that or create that and then hit next and we want to also create a desktop icon next again and install and it's going to quickly install a lot of stuff and now we can launch the mega game immediately here I'm just going to uncheck that to show you that it's now on the desktop here as a shortcut it's also in the Start menu here on the recently added and if we go and open the file location you can see that our mega game XE executable is here our data is here that's also an uninstalled EXCI so if you want to uninstall this program you can simply run this and now we can simply double click make a game to open it up and you can see we have our display dialog er resolution dialog with the banner that you've input that you've set if you have said any banner I don't think it's necessary this is just a formality kind of but you can of course put something coollooking there and now we can hit play and enjoy our game as installed by I in our system so we can now hit play game here and play through ok so it's actually that easy so that's basically all I wanted to cover in this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'm definitely looking forward to showing how you can export your game to a webbased platform as well so again thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
