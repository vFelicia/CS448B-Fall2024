00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus I want to
00:04 - welcome to this video and making a
00:05 - multiplayer PS in unity today we are
00:07 - going to be looking at something really
00:09 - exciting which is importing a
00:11 - cool-looking arena adding a bunch of
00:13 - particle effects and playing around with
00:16 - the lighting to make our scene look a
00:18 - lot more awesome so I've really been
00:20 - looking forward to this video we're not
00:21 - going to be writing a single line of
00:23 - code but we have plenty of stuff to do
00:25 - and the arena of course is custom made
00:27 - and you can use it in any way you like
00:30 - also commercially it's available for
00:32 - download now for free as part of the
00:36 - multiplayer FPS assets pack so without
00:39 - further ado let's jump right into it so
00:42 - you can see that I'm here in unity and I
00:43 - just want to begin by setting up the
00:45 - light the lighting settings so if you go
00:47 - to window and select our lighting it's
00:51 - somewhere here for some reason I kept
00:55 - there it is if you haven't got it open
00:58 - and I like to dock it over here by the
00:59 - inspector and we just want to make sure
01:01 - that our arm build settings down here
01:05 - when it comes to the light Maps is set
01:07 - to auto just so that it will auto build
01:10 - everything as we change things as we go
01:12 - and then we pretty much want to close
01:15 - down unity here or minimize it
01:16 - find the multiplayer FPS assets when
01:18 - you've downloaded those and I've
01:20 - prepared an arena unity package and I've
01:23 - done this because the arena is huge and
01:25 - it has a bunch of models and textures
01:27 - and materials and it's way too much to
01:30 - fit into well even several videos to set
01:34 - all of that up so I've gone ahead and
01:36 - done most of it and we'll just finish it
01:38 - off in this video if you want to do all
01:41 - of this on your own or say edit some of
01:44 - the source files I have included those
01:46 - here so the arena source files let's
01:48 - build up both a blender version and an
01:50 - FBX version and all of the textures that
01:53 - you might use are in here but you can
01:56 - also just import the unity package and
01:58 - then edit the files from there which I
02:00 - definitely recommend you do so please
02:02 - please use this if if you can also on
02:06 - the unity package uses the blender file
02:08 - which means that in order for unity to
02:10 - import and process it properly
02:13 - we will need to have blender installed
02:15 - there will be a link to that in the
02:17 - description it's not a large programming
02:19 - and in any way and it's great to have
02:21 - because it's well friendly awesome to
02:24 - model in so I just definitely just
02:26 - recommend you go over there and install
02:28 - blender so without further ado let's
02:30 - double-click on the arena unity package
02:32 - to open it up in unity here and we can
02:35 - of course deselect different stuff but
02:37 - we just want to import all of it let's
02:39 - say hit import here and this will take a
02:44 - little while because we do have a lot of
02:46 - textures some of them fairly high
02:48 - resolution and some fairly high um
02:53 - detailed models so it will take a little
02:56 - while especially because we have all of
02:59 - the relations between the objects
03:01 - already set up for you so unity has
03:03 - remembered all that stuff but as soon as
03:05 - the as this is done you will see that
03:08 - you get an arena folder over here and in
03:11 - here we have the R this is the model
03:13 - itself you can double click this and it
03:15 - will open up in blender we have a
03:17 - materials folder with all of the
03:19 - different materials that we are going to
03:21 - need and it's actually gone ahead and
03:23 - included some that we don't need so I'm
03:26 - just going to go ahead and delete all of
03:27 - the weirdly named ones which is all of
03:30 - these these shouldn't even be in here
03:34 - it's just the way that unity exports
03:37 - unity packages sometimes it's a bit
03:40 - annoying so you can just select the same
03:43 - ones that I am selecting here if you
03:45 - want to get rid of them or you can just
03:48 - leave them in there it's not going to
03:49 - make a huge difference so just delete
03:51 - all of those and I'm going to do the
03:54 - same with okay so the textures are
03:55 - actually already set up so that was
03:58 - pretty much all we needed to do and now
03:59 - we can just take the arena prefab here
04:01 - which is the one that I've set up for
04:03 - you and simply drag it into a project
04:05 - panel and you should see that all of the
04:08 - textures are here nothing appears weird
04:10 - or anything if it does you might have
04:13 - deleted something that you weren't
04:14 - supposed to so just make sure you don't
04:16 - delete anything I didn't and you can see
04:19 - that this already looks fairly cool but
04:21 - we have so much that we can add it
04:23 - inside of this and you can pretty much
04:25 - click on anything
04:26 - and edit the material or whatever all of
04:29 - the inspectors settings are here so
04:31 - that's pretty cool but what I wanted to
04:33 - go ahead and do is take our environment
04:35 - here and then drag our directional light
04:37 - out from that and maybe call this our
04:39 - Sun and then um you can remove or just
04:43 - disable the environment that we had
04:44 - before just so we only have the arena to
04:47 - work with here so my arena is centered I
04:51 - I think you should do the same thing and
04:53 - basically what I want to begin with here
04:55 - you can see that I've actually made a
04:57 - short to do this here we start by
05:00 - importing the arena well we just did
05:01 - that now we need to set a few layers
05:03 - because the arena here actually I
05:07 - already has some colliders set up if we
05:10 - are select for example the floor here
05:13 - you can see it has a mesh Collider over
05:15 - here however in order for our player to
05:19 - be able to stand on top of this using
05:21 - the system where we're a cast to check
05:24 - if the it's if the player is collidable
05:27 - with this so that he will be able to
05:29 - hover a certain distance above the
05:31 - ground we will have to make sure to
05:32 - change all of the layers where we want
05:34 - that to happen to collidable environment
05:36 - and i've actually done this with my
05:38 - prefab but if your settings are
05:40 - different you will have to go in and do
05:42 - this yourself so make sure to make a tag
05:45 - it as whatever you have called that tag
05:47 - in my case it's collidable environment
05:50 - and you will have to do that with all of
05:52 - the flying platforms as well and you can
05:54 - see here it hasn't done that so let's go
05:56 - and change the layer I believe it just
05:58 - attack if the layer that you want to
06:00 - change you can of course also going and
06:02 - and tagged stuff differently so that
06:05 - will just set that up and that's pretty
06:07 - much all I meant by set layers now we
06:11 - need to position our scene camera
06:13 - because we have our scene camera here
06:15 - and currently it gets an overview of the
06:18 - entire map and that's fine but it
06:19 - doesn't necessarily look too good from
06:22 - the outside so let's find somewhere
06:24 - inside of our scene that looks nice and
06:28 - I'm just going to position it somewhere
06:31 - around here is a pretty nice look I
06:36 - think it gives a pretty nice overview of
06:38 - the map but still with
06:40 - a bit of perspective and what you can do
06:42 - if you've positioned your scene here in
06:46 - a way that you would like your camera to
06:47 - be is press on the scene camera and then
06:50 - press control ship shift F and if you're
06:53 - on a Mac that would be command shift F
06:54 - and it's the same as going to I believe
06:57 - it's game object and then I line with
07:00 - our view and you can see that the scene
07:02 - camera has now snapped to that view so
07:05 - in the game view here will now be the
07:07 - same as the scene view of course not if
07:09 - we change anything you're not seeing the
07:11 - and the camera is still static oops
07:13 - let's just drag that back there
07:15 - cool so I think that looks pretty nice
07:17 - and you can of course position it
07:19 - otherwise and what we also want to do to
07:21 - our scene camera here is just make sure
07:24 - this is not a solid color but that it's
07:25 - also using the skybox however it's not
07:28 - currently visible cone so that was on
07:32 - that now we can go in here we've
07:35 - positioned the camera and it's using the
07:36 - skybox that's perfect now we want to set
07:38 - up another skybox because I think the
07:40 - default skybox is nice for a lot of
07:42 - things but I don't think it kind of
07:44 - suits the style that I'm going for with
07:45 - this arena which is kind of an evening
07:49 - look where the Sun is setting or rising
07:53 - of course and yeah so I want to find
07:57 - something that looks a bit like that and
07:59 - if you do too then go to the asset store
08:03 - and search for skybox and again you find
08:05 - the asset store by going to window and
08:07 - then opening up the asset store it's
08:11 - something here cannot find anything
08:13 - today so we have the asset store right
08:18 - there ok so tunnel vision and search for
08:22 - sky box and hit free only and you
08:24 - actually get a bunch of very high
08:26 - quality sky boxes that you can use in
08:28 - your game and I really like the one
08:29 - called cope here the free skybox pack so
08:33 - if we go ahead and hit import on this
08:34 - that's a really nice guy box in here
08:37 - called sunset which is pretty much
08:39 - perfect for what for the look that I'm
08:41 - going for so let's go ahead and hit
08:43 - import on that and it's just going to
08:46 - import all of the textures and the
08:49 - materials that it set up and it
08:50 - shouldn't take long it's already done
08:52 - here and I'm
08:53 - is going to call this skyboxes there we
08:56 - go and this is again of course free so
08:59 - you can download it as well or find some
09:01 - other pack that suits you and then we'll
09:03 - go under your lighting and we'll change
09:04 - the default skybox to instead be sunset
09:08 - okay so this kind of this very much
09:11 - changes the look of our scene but I
09:13 - think this skybox is absolutely
09:15 - beautiful so that's what we are going to
09:17 - be using and I want to boost the ambient
09:20 - intensity of the light by something like
09:22 - two maybe even two point three I really
09:25 - want that to be very bright by default I
09:29 - think that gives it a nice look in here
09:31 - and we'll also get some other lights in
09:33 - here as well of course so all the other
09:36 - settings I believe we can pretty much
09:38 - leave as is we might want to drag our
09:40 - Sun into the Sun slot right there and we
09:44 - can also find the skybox
09:46 - find the Sun set here and I think the
09:48 - skybox is amazing but it is a tiny bit
09:51 - too dark so what I like to do is go in
09:53 - here and simply bring up the exposure to
09:55 - something like 1.2 and then we'll just
09:58 - boost the overall brightness of the
10:00 - skybox a tiny bit cool I think it's time
10:05 - to mess around with the light but let's
10:07 - see what I have planned here so now it's
10:09 - time to set up lighting and when it
10:12 - comes to lighting I think it's great to
10:14 - start with a cool directional light we
10:16 - already have that in here and I
10:19 - basically want to rotate this to
10:20 - something like 11 negative 108 and 20
10:26 - and I believe that should rotate it to
10:28 - kind of point to what the Sun in our
10:33 - skybox it's actually a bit off so we can
10:35 - just go ahead and rotate it a tiny bit
10:37 - there just so it points in the general
10:39 - direction and the general direction off
10:43 - on the Sun from our skybox I believe
10:46 - that gives the greatest look and you can
10:48 - see the kind of the sun shining in on
10:51 - just part of the arena here and that
10:53 - gives a very cool feel to it so I will
10:55 - also edit the color here and I've
10:57 - actually prepared a color that I think
10:59 - works nice with the scene kind of an
11:01 - evening color here but you can choose
11:02 - your own or just copy the hex color from
11:05 - down here
11:06 - I want the intensity to be somewhere
11:08 - like 1.3 so it is kind of bright but
11:13 - still you can see that it's it's
11:14 - disappearing between the hills and I
11:17 - definitely want soft shadows to be on I
11:19 - think that gives a very nice look for
11:21 - the directional light but you might want
11:23 - to not have that on some of the point
11:25 - lights that will be adding later so that
11:27 - was all for the Sun what I also want to
11:30 - do is kind of have a central light in
11:32 - the middle of the arena maybe up towards
11:36 - the ceiling here and you can see that
11:40 - nice glowing effect that we have on this
11:42 - that kind of just gives the arena some
11:45 - indoor mood light so that's um
11:48 - right-click go light and point light and
11:53 - let's set this up so I want this to be
11:55 - at a y-value of something like two point
11:58 - six five maybe something like that just
12:01 - in the middle of the arena I want the
12:04 - range to be something like 25 the color
12:07 - and I've prepared a color again here
12:10 - just so we don't spend too long trying
12:12 - to get that right you can see it just
12:14 - gives this very nice warm feel almost as
12:16 - if it was coming from this sign up here
12:19 - that's kind of the point you can maybe
12:21 - just raise it a tiny bit and I want the
12:24 - intensity I think to pretty much just be
12:27 - one however to make this effect really
12:30 - nice what I will do is I will go ahead
12:32 - and enable hot cast shadows and this
12:36 - will of course take some performance if
12:38 - you're making this game for a mobile
12:40 - application you probably don't want to
12:42 - have hard shadows on your point lights
12:44 - or at least you want to be careful with
12:46 - how many you have but on a stationary
12:50 - computer or a modern laptop this should
12:53 - not be a problem whatsoever so I just
12:55 - think it really gives a nice feel you
12:57 - can see all of the bars here shining
13:00 - onto the chairs that looks kind of cool
13:04 - you can see what that does to the
13:08 - environment good so yep that all looks
13:14 - nice and we can go in here and just make
13:15 - sure lighting data set was build with an
13:18 - in yeah we can now get that rid of the
13:20 - by removing the auto here and going
13:22 - clear big data and then choosing Auto
13:26 - again and it's going to auto bake the
13:27 - light map now so that's perfect and
13:31 - where do we want to go from now well I
13:33 - definitely want to have some more light
13:35 - in here but I want to have some flames
13:37 - under the obstacles here some cool flame
13:39 - particles and we'll have them light up
13:42 - the arena as well and we'll have them be
13:45 - animated so that they vary in intensity
13:48 - that's a really nice feel so we'll call
13:50 - this the arena center light and we could
13:55 - make this part of the prefab but I'll
13:56 - just keep it out of it for now just so
14:00 - we preserve the original prefab I don't
14:02 - know it just feels better so let's start
14:05 - by doing that as well okay so the next
14:09 - thing on our list here is setting up the
14:12 - flying platforms because at the moment
14:14 - they look at tiny bit boring so again I
14:18 - want to create these huge flames from
14:20 - underneath and we will of course defy
14:23 - physics on this one but I think it's
14:25 - okay because we do have fighting robots
14:27 - in what looks to be a clash between a
14:30 - sci-fi and a Roman Stadium so it's not
14:34 - really realism we're going for it
14:35 - anyways so let's go in here and let's
14:38 - find a cool particle effect to work off
14:43 - of and it's just so happens that unity
14:45 - standard acids include some very cool
14:47 - particle effects especially almost there
14:50 - flames that look really nice and that
14:53 - are very easy to edit so let's just use
14:56 - that as a base for what we're going to
14:58 - be making so but I just noticed that we
15:01 - have a bunch of scripts down here
15:03 - cluttering everything so I'll just take
15:05 - all the scripts into the scripts folder
15:06 - and the room list item into the prefabs
15:09 - just to clean this up a bit because we
15:10 - are we do have a lot of stuff in here
15:13 - and I also have a main level 1 folder I
15:15 - don't know why it's there but we should
15:16 - definitely delete it okay so I know
15:20 - standard assets particle systems and
15:23 - then prefabs you should see a fire
15:26 - complex prefab and that's what I want to
15:29 - use again if you don't have this simply
15:31 - run
15:32 - I click in the project panel go import
15:35 - package and then particle systems and
15:36 - you can make sure that it's imported
15:38 - there but for now we are just going to
15:40 - whoops not prefabs be using it here and
15:43 - let's take it and drag it into the scene
15:46 - and let's find it here let's reset that
15:49 - in the inspector and yep so that's cool
15:54 - and we can delete this script here that
15:56 - is currently missing we don't need that
15:58 - and I don't think we need to multiply
15:59 - this I actually like the default look so
16:02 - that's fine and you can go ahead and
16:04 - select the different particle systems to
16:06 - see them playing or we could just go
16:08 - ahead and hit the play button kind of to
16:10 - see what this file looks like and you
16:12 - can see it has this really nice
16:14 - realistic look where the light is
16:16 - animated in such a way that's actually
16:18 - done using a script that it both varies
16:21 - in intensity and moves around to give a
16:23 - very cool looking a lively fire effect
16:28 - so what we are going to do here is first
16:31 - off we are going to boost the range of
16:33 - this light to something like 10 and I
16:36 - don't think we need to edit the color or
16:39 - the intensity so we'll just leave those
16:42 - as is and then we can um what we
16:46 - basically want to do is we want to flip
16:48 - this effect on its head because we
16:51 - wanted to appear that the fire is coming
16:54 - from beneath these obstacles so let's go
16:57 - ahead and bring this over to one of the
16:59 - obstacles and we can do that by dragging
17:02 - it under one of the flying platforms and
17:04 - then resetting the transform once again
17:07 - so you can see now it's centered on
17:08 - there and we can maybe move this down a
17:11 - bit and we'll just drag it actually
17:15 - let's just have it be part of the
17:16 - platform for now that's fine so we'll
17:18 - bring it to the very bottom of on the
17:23 - platform and then we'll go and look at
17:26 - on the different effects so when it
17:29 - comes to the light actually let's move
17:32 - the whole thing down so that we assure
17:33 - that when the light moves it doesn't go
17:35 - up into the actual platform and then we
17:38 - can move all of the other effects up as
17:40 - we want to so this actual fire effect
17:43 - almost look looks perfect
17:46 - just as is I really like the glowing
17:48 - effect here and it's fine that it rises
17:52 - we can go ahead and just flip the
17:55 - direction on this actually I really like
17:59 - that so let's just have that be flipped
18:01 - and that's fine and then we can find our
18:06 - flames and these are the ones that we
18:08 - definitely need to edit so let's flip
18:09 - the direction on the 90 degrees there
18:12 - however you can sit still our goes
18:14 - upwards and that's because we need to
18:17 - flip it in here as well so the start
18:20 - rotation here let's make that a constant
18:22 - add on 90 a 180 degrees so you can see
18:27 - that flipped it on its head and now we
18:28 - just need to move it down and also we
18:31 - need to remove the gravity modifier so
18:34 - that it stays in place and now we can
18:38 - move it up so that it fits something
18:41 - like that looks pretty nice I don't want
18:43 - any clipping to occur so just move it
18:45 - below so don't doesn't clip into the
18:48 - platform and I think this looks really
18:50 - great as always spend more time on this
18:53 - than I do please to make it look just
18:57 - right but I don't have infinite time
18:59 - when it comes to modifying this stuff we
19:02 - do need to get on with the tutorial so
19:04 - let's select the eye darksmoke here and
19:07 - that's kind of a crazy effect we have
19:09 - going on here and I actually really like
19:11 - it as is but I think we should maybe
19:13 - move it down a bit just a tad and we'll
19:19 - maybe see the start road and the
19:21 - rotation is actually kind of nice if we
19:24 - flip that 90 degrees I'll go crazy but I
19:28 - actually like that I think it's pretty
19:30 - good what we can also do is go into the
19:33 - force over lifetime and make it not rise
19:35 - up as quickly so bump the Y value down
19:38 - nope I want that to stay but we can
19:41 - maybe do a negative one here I don't
19:45 - want it to just go right on through our
19:48 - surface
19:50 - okay I think we'll keep the original
19:52 - value then it's probably better and then
19:56 - we can take the C value here Z value and
19:59 - bump it down to 0.5 so it doesn't look
20:02 - as crazy
20:03 - I actually kind of like that and we can
20:05 - take the emission and run that down as
20:07 - well so it isn't as crazy something like
20:09 - that looks really nice and we do need to
20:11 - do the same thing with the lit smoke
20:13 - that's this one we can pretty much do
20:17 - that by I think we might be able to just
20:20 - rotate it ah so now it just goes
20:25 - straight up and then we want to rotate
20:27 - it on the whatever here so that's just
20:32 - rotated manually so it follows the other
20:35 - smoke here I think that looks pretty
20:38 - great actually and we can add a okay
20:42 - we'll just use the force of a lifetime
20:44 - and I'll just remove the C value see
20:47 - what that does actually really like that
20:49 - so it there is some wind to it I think
20:52 - that looks kind of cool
20:54 - we'll just keep that in there we can
20:56 - maybe move it over a bit there okay so
21:00 - again spend more time but for now we'll
21:02 - be happy with this maybe move it down a
21:05 - bit as well actually it's more the dark
21:10 - smoke that we need to move down
21:12 - something like that okay cool so we're
21:15 - happy with that and then we'll find the
21:18 - sparks falling here and we want to
21:21 - rotate those as well to just point
21:23 - straight down so I'll just do a zero on
21:25 - the x-axis there and I really like the
21:29 - feel of these however I want them to go
21:31 - slower so let's do something like point
21:34 - point two on the gravity modifier I
21:38 - think that looks really really cool and
21:40 - the sparks rising we don't want them to
21:44 - go straight through but I definitely
21:45 - want to have some sparks rising so what
21:47 - we'll do is we'll add some kind of maybe
21:51 - we'll just flip those somehow change the
21:59 - start speed here to be a constant we can
22:02 - add some speed to those
22:05 - something like that and we can do
22:06 - negative 90 to make them follow our
22:09 - smoke and so it will really appear that
22:13 - the wind is blowing here so I actually
22:15 - really like that however I think it's
22:18 - too much when it comes to the emission
22:20 - so you can go in here and change the
22:22 - curve or we could just on change let's
22:28 - see here that's actually going here and
22:30 - find the curve of this come on on time
22:37 - for some reason it doesn't want to open
22:41 - up my curve editor here that's kind of
22:44 - annoying that's okay what we can do
22:47 - instead is we can simply bump down the
22:49 - color here so we can lessen the Alpha a
22:53 - little bit and I think this will give
22:57 - kind of the effect that we are going for
22:59 - something like that just to not make it
23:02 - as apparent okay I really like that I
23:05 - think that works just fine and again
23:07 - play more around with it
23:09 - now we can take this fire complex and we
23:11 - can duplicate it a bunch of times and
23:13 - move it over to the other platforms as
23:15 - well so I'm just going to snap to the
23:19 - top view here shift to on or auto
23:21 - graphic and move that over there I
23:25 - believe that's flying platform - no
23:28 - that's actually that one over there so
23:29 - we'll move that over there duplicated -
23:33 - flying platform 3 that's that one so
23:35 - let's move it over there as well I'm
23:38 - doing it this way so that we can
23:39 - preserve the Y positioning and that over
23:42 - to platform 4 which is hopefully that
23:45 - one over there that's perfect
23:47 - coal and the naming here pretty much
23:51 - doesn't matter so we'll have all of
23:53 - those in there and now when we should
23:55 - switch back into our perspective mode
23:58 - and hit play this looks super cool so I
24:05 - really like the effect that we have
24:06 - going here I really like how it's it's
24:09 - very clear with the wind and all of that
24:13 - good so we can save that and on the next
24:16 - thing on
24:17 - list is dust particles are oh actually I
24:22 - wanted to create a hover animation I
24:23 - think you should go ahead and do this
24:25 - yourself because we will run out of time
24:27 - if I need to go in and do this but it is
24:30 - as basic as finding our animation window
24:34 - right here and then adding a new
24:37 - animation clip and simply animating
24:39 - these platforms on the why it's not too
24:42 - difficult it should definitely be doable
24:44 - and what I also do is I'll shift these a
24:47 - bit in height I think that will look
24:49 - cool if we just have them be random
24:53 - Heights here so something like that that
24:55 - looks better okay and then have them
24:59 - hover up and down that would be just to
25:01 - be awesome and your of course stuff
25:03 - definitely free to add obstacles in here
25:06 - I've purposefully made this a very open
25:09 - arena with not a lot of stuff in it so
25:12 - you can go go crazy with um with
25:15 - designing the gameplay on your own yeah
25:20 - so some test particles and these are
25:22 - very easy to add as well let's find the
25:24 - dust storm prefab again under the
25:26 - standard acid particle systems simply
25:29 - drag that in here and I think this is a
25:31 - prefab that looks very cool just right
25:33 - off the bat we'll just change a few
25:35 - settings so it isn't as large so I will
25:38 - find the shape here and make that
25:39 - something like 40 by 40 or 40 by maybe
25:44 - five by 40 that's 50 40 and let's see
25:50 - just in which direction we made our
25:54 - flames blow in the air here so let's see
26:02 - where was it there so let's find our
26:05 - smoke and our sparks there okay so it
26:10 - went in this direction here so I
26:12 - definitely want our particles to go in
26:16 - the same direction and right now I
26:18 - believe yeah they're going in the pretty
26:21 - much opposite direction so let's do a
26:23 - knot on the X let's do this on the Y of
26:26 - 180 on that and maybe just correct it a
26:29 - tiny bit
26:30 - something like that looks a lot better
26:32 - we can also move it over and let's bump
26:35 - down the admission on this to something
26:37 - like forty maybe let's go back into the
26:40 - arena see what it looks like in here I
26:43 - think it gives a really nice feel
26:44 - however I don't want this to affect the
26:46 - gameplay so we'll just drag it up over
26:49 - the game actual gameplay area or over
26:51 - above the ground at least so that down
26:54 - here you won't be affected by the dust
26:56 - underneath if you look up it becomes
26:59 - very clear that that is definitely a
27:01 - thing so I think that looks pretty cool
27:03 - and I just want to change the color of
27:06 - this to tinned it a tiny bit orange ah
27:11 - there and in here there we go
27:16 - I think that looks really really awesome
27:18 - so we'll just keep that in there and
27:21 - have that playing all the time and we
27:25 - also want to check pre won't run
27:28 - pre-warm on that so that it is going
27:32 - just when we play the game and the next
27:35 - thing on our list and this is a crazy
27:37 - list I'm just going to have a sip of
27:39 - water our image effects hmm and you can
27:45 - pretty much go completely crazy with
27:47 - image effects you can add a color
27:50 - correction you can add a vignette you
27:52 - can add chromatic aberration now all
27:55 - kinds of stuff but I'm just going to add
27:57 - what I think are the two most essential
28:00 - image effects for making your game look
28:03 - a lot cooler without the user thinking
28:06 - wow this is edited this almost looks
28:09 - like he went into Photoshop and play
28:12 - around with all the colors without it
28:14 - being too distracting and unity of
28:17 - course again has some nice standard
28:19 - assets when it comes to this let's
28:20 - import them by going by right clicking
28:23 - import package and then going effects
28:27 - and it's going to process all them here
28:30 - that's it import and there are a bunch
28:32 - of different effects in here you can
28:34 - pretty much add effects all you want it
28:37 - has a really nice vignette and chromatic
28:40 - aberration if that's
28:42 - and the effect that you're going for and
28:44 - I'm just going to find my scene camera
28:47 - here and edit this and let's bring up
28:49 - the art game view so we can see this
28:51 - applied and the first thing that I want
28:53 - to add is screen space ambient occlusion
28:55 - and also called ssao
28:58 - and this is just a very nice image
29:01 - effect that fakes ambient occlusion by
29:05 - looking pretty much at what the screen
29:07 - is seeing so it's it's adding this into
29:10 - the render pod line instead of rendering
29:12 - it into a light map or baking it into a
29:15 - light map beforehand so it's it's adding
29:17 - it real time so therefore it is a bit of
29:20 - an expensive effect but I think it's so
29:22 - worth it when you when you see it so I'm
29:25 - just going to search for screen space
29:28 - ambient and you want occlusion not
29:30 - obscure in so occlusion here and you can
29:33 - see the nice shadows that this adds it
29:35 - adds shadows wherever to objects or
29:39 - surfaces meet and we definitely want to
29:42 - edit that this a bit we are going to
29:46 - bump down the radius to something a lot
29:50 - smaller here something like um I don't
29:55 - know there looks pretty good
29:57 - the occlusion attends intensity I think
29:59 - is fine it is a pretty high intensity
30:02 - but that's alright so let's just have it
30:05 - be some something like that looks pretty
30:07 - nice and you can of course see it in the
30:09 - scene view so let's just cover this
30:12 - component and add it to a player camera
30:15 - as well so paste the component that's
30:17 - new there and on the player will also
30:19 - add a motion blur and we want that
30:22 - called the one called camera motion blur
30:25 - and I really like the default settings
30:28 - on this one so when we hit play now and
30:30 - jump in here with our character and I
30:34 - think this is the first time we're
30:35 - moving around you can see that we have
30:37 - this these cool shadows and we have the
30:41 - nice effects I actually think the dust
30:43 - storm is just a bit too much and
30:46 - everything else looks really nice and
30:49 - you can see that we can hit everything
30:51 - we can fly past this grid and we are
30:55 - able to fly
30:56 - on top of obstacles so let's let's just
30:58 - try that real quick and you can see
31:00 - there and I was able to fly on top of it
31:02 - even though I kind of failed at it
31:04 - so you can see if we can stand on top of
31:06 - this and everything looks cold so I'm
31:10 - actually really happy with that so we'll
31:12 - keep that I will just go in here and
31:14 - bump the emission on the dust storm down
31:16 - to something like thirty and maybe bring
31:21 - the color down just a bit on the Alpha
31:24 - here you can do that something like that
31:27 - I think that's better we can also take
31:30 - it find it in in our scene here on a
31:34 - dust storm and maybe move it up even a
31:36 - bit more here just so it's an effect to
31:40 - see when we look up and that's perfect
31:43 - and let's go back here and the last
31:45 - thing that we want to do is just set a
31:47 - couple of spawn points inside of our
31:48 - arena that make sense
31:49 - so let's find our first spawn point here
31:52 - that's currently right here and I
31:54 - actually think that that's a fine place
31:56 - for us to spawn but I just want to let's
32:01 - see Center it on the X there and
32:04 - everything else looks fine the second
32:07 - spawn point is over here that's fine as
32:11 - well oops that is centered on the X and
32:16 - we can just move it over here cool and I
32:19 - just want to create a couple more I want
32:22 - to create spawn point three here
32:25 - alright let's actually move this on top
32:28 - of one of the platforms let's Center it
32:31 - out in this on the platform there that
32:34 - looks good let's move it over drag it on
32:38 - top there we go I think that looks
32:41 - really nice and the fourth one here will
32:47 - just position add a nother part of the
32:50 - map just to make it or to confuse the
32:53 - players so they aren't able to just camp
32:57 - one spawn point that would be annoying
32:59 - especially when the map is this small
33:01 - and what you want to do is of course add
33:03 - some obstacles in here to duck behind
33:05 - and maybe have some of the spawn points
33:07 - be behind those obstacles
33:09 - so the
33:09 - so that the players aren't shut
33:11 - immediately after they spawn but I think
33:14 - that will be just fine and I believe
33:17 - that the way that we have said it set up
33:19 - here is that um it will automatically
33:22 - include include those two that we just
33:24 - added so that was the entire list I hope
33:28 - you were able to follow me in all of
33:31 - this stuff I really think on the prod or
33:33 - er the final arena here looks super cool
33:39 - and you should definitely play around
33:41 - with it it's again completely free for
33:43 - you to use so yep that's pretty much it
33:47 - thank you so much to some mean iben for
33:51 - creating this arena
33:53 - it's a amazing job if you want to order
33:57 - on other your arm models he does do
34:00 - client work his are not expensive and he
34:04 - is very kind so I definitely recommend
34:07 - him he's my go-to modeler and without
34:10 - further ado thanks for watching and I'll
34:13 - see you in the next video thank you so
34:15 - much to all of the awesome patreon
34:17 - supporters who donated in July and a
34:19 - special thanks to vixen Minnesota and UK
34:22 - and Lux game TV these videos wouldn't be
34:25 - possible without you

Cleaned transcript:

thanks for tuning in at brakus I want to welcome to this video and making a multiplayer PS in unity today we are going to be looking at something really exciting which is importing a coollooking arena adding a bunch of particle effects and playing around with the lighting to make our scene look a lot more awesome so I've really been looking forward to this video we're not going to be writing a single line of code but we have plenty of stuff to do and the arena of course is custom made and you can use it in any way you like also commercially it's available for download now for free as part of the multiplayer FPS assets pack so without further ado let's jump right into it so you can see that I'm here in unity and I just want to begin by setting up the light the lighting settings so if you go to window and select our lighting it's somewhere here for some reason I kept there it is if you haven't got it open and I like to dock it over here by the inspector and we just want to make sure that our arm build settings down here when it comes to the light Maps is set to auto just so that it will auto build everything as we change things as we go and then we pretty much want to close down unity here or minimize it find the multiplayer FPS assets when you've downloaded those and I've prepared an arena unity package and I've done this because the arena is huge and it has a bunch of models and textures and materials and it's way too much to fit into well even several videos to set all of that up so I've gone ahead and done most of it and we'll just finish it off in this video if you want to do all of this on your own or say edit some of the source files I have included those here so the arena source files let's build up both a blender version and an FBX version and all of the textures that you might use are in here but you can also just import the unity package and then edit the files from there which I definitely recommend you do so please please use this if if you can also on the unity package uses the blender file which means that in order for unity to import and process it properly we will need to have blender installed there will be a link to that in the description it's not a large programming and in any way and it's great to have because it's well friendly awesome to model in so I just definitely just recommend you go over there and install blender so without further ado let's doubleclick on the arena unity package to open it up in unity here and we can of course deselect different stuff but we just want to import all of it let's say hit import here and this will take a little while because we do have a lot of textures some of them fairly high resolution and some fairly high um detailed models so it will take a little while especially because we have all of the relations between the objects already set up for you so unity has remembered all that stuff but as soon as the as this is done you will see that you get an arena folder over here and in here we have the R this is the model itself you can double click this and it will open up in blender we have a materials folder with all of the different materials that we are going to need and it's actually gone ahead and included some that we don't need so I'm just going to go ahead and delete all of the weirdly named ones which is all of these these shouldn't even be in here it's just the way that unity exports unity packages sometimes it's a bit annoying so you can just select the same ones that I am selecting here if you want to get rid of them or you can just leave them in there it's not going to make a huge difference so just delete all of those and I'm going to do the same with okay so the textures are actually already set up so that was pretty much all we needed to do and now we can just take the arena prefab here which is the one that I've set up for you and simply drag it into a project panel and you should see that all of the textures are here nothing appears weird or anything if it does you might have deleted something that you weren't supposed to so just make sure you don't delete anything I didn't and you can see that this already looks fairly cool but we have so much that we can add it inside of this and you can pretty much click on anything and edit the material or whatever all of the inspectors settings are here so that's pretty cool but what I wanted to go ahead and do is take our environment here and then drag our directional light out from that and maybe call this our Sun and then um you can remove or just disable the environment that we had before just so we only have the arena to work with here so my arena is centered I I think you should do the same thing and basically what I want to begin with here you can see that I've actually made a short to do this here we start by importing the arena well we just did that now we need to set a few layers because the arena here actually I already has some colliders set up if we are select for example the floor here you can see it has a mesh Collider over here however in order for our player to be able to stand on top of this using the system where we're a cast to check if the it's if the player is collidable with this so that he will be able to hover a certain distance above the ground we will have to make sure to change all of the layers where we want that to happen to collidable environment and i've actually done this with my prefab but if your settings are different you will have to go in and do this yourself so make sure to make a tag it as whatever you have called that tag in my case it's collidable environment and you will have to do that with all of the flying platforms as well and you can see here it hasn't done that so let's go and change the layer I believe it just attack if the layer that you want to change you can of course also going and and tagged stuff differently so that will just set that up and that's pretty much all I meant by set layers now we need to position our scene camera because we have our scene camera here and currently it gets an overview of the entire map and that's fine but it doesn't necessarily look too good from the outside so let's find somewhere inside of our scene that looks nice and I'm just going to position it somewhere around here is a pretty nice look I think it gives a pretty nice overview of the map but still with a bit of perspective and what you can do if you've positioned your scene here in a way that you would like your camera to be is press on the scene camera and then press control ship shift F and if you're on a Mac that would be command shift F and it's the same as going to I believe it's game object and then I line with our view and you can see that the scene camera has now snapped to that view so in the game view here will now be the same as the scene view of course not if we change anything you're not seeing the and the camera is still static oops let's just drag that back there cool so I think that looks pretty nice and you can of course position it otherwise and what we also want to do to our scene camera here is just make sure this is not a solid color but that it's also using the skybox however it's not currently visible cone so that was on that now we can go in here we've positioned the camera and it's using the skybox that's perfect now we want to set up another skybox because I think the default skybox is nice for a lot of things but I don't think it kind of suits the style that I'm going for with this arena which is kind of an evening look where the Sun is setting or rising of course and yeah so I want to find something that looks a bit like that and if you do too then go to the asset store and search for skybox and again you find the asset store by going to window and then opening up the asset store it's something here cannot find anything today so we have the asset store right there ok so tunnel vision and search for sky box and hit free only and you actually get a bunch of very high quality sky boxes that you can use in your game and I really like the one called cope here the free skybox pack so if we go ahead and hit import on this that's a really nice guy box in here called sunset which is pretty much perfect for what for the look that I'm going for so let's go ahead and hit import on that and it's just going to import all of the textures and the materials that it set up and it shouldn't take long it's already done here and I'm is going to call this skyboxes there we go and this is again of course free so you can download it as well or find some other pack that suits you and then we'll go under your lighting and we'll change the default skybox to instead be sunset okay so this kind of this very much changes the look of our scene but I think this skybox is absolutely beautiful so that's what we are going to be using and I want to boost the ambient intensity of the light by something like two maybe even two point three I really want that to be very bright by default I think that gives it a nice look in here and we'll also get some other lights in here as well of course so all the other settings I believe we can pretty much leave as is we might want to drag our Sun into the Sun slot right there and we can also find the skybox find the Sun set here and I think the skybox is amazing but it is a tiny bit too dark so what I like to do is go in here and simply bring up the exposure to something like 1.2 and then we'll just boost the overall brightness of the skybox a tiny bit cool I think it's time to mess around with the light but let's see what I have planned here so now it's time to set up lighting and when it comes to lighting I think it's great to start with a cool directional light we already have that in here and I basically want to rotate this to something like 11 negative 108 and 20 and I believe that should rotate it to kind of point to what the Sun in our skybox it's actually a bit off so we can just go ahead and rotate it a tiny bit there just so it points in the general direction and the general direction off on the Sun from our skybox I believe that gives the greatest look and you can see the kind of the sun shining in on just part of the arena here and that gives a very cool feel to it so I will also edit the color here and I've actually prepared a color that I think works nice with the scene kind of an evening color here but you can choose your own or just copy the hex color from down here I want the intensity to be somewhere like 1.3 so it is kind of bright but still you can see that it's it's disappearing between the hills and I definitely want soft shadows to be on I think that gives a very nice look for the directional light but you might want to not have that on some of the point lights that will be adding later so that was all for the Sun what I also want to do is kind of have a central light in the middle of the arena maybe up towards the ceiling here and you can see that nice glowing effect that we have on this that kind of just gives the arena some indoor mood light so that's um rightclick go light and point light and let's set this up so I want this to be at a yvalue of something like two point six five maybe something like that just in the middle of the arena I want the range to be something like 25 the color and I've prepared a color again here just so we don't spend too long trying to get that right you can see it just gives this very nice warm feel almost as if it was coming from this sign up here that's kind of the point you can maybe just raise it a tiny bit and I want the intensity I think to pretty much just be one however to make this effect really nice what I will do is I will go ahead and enable hot cast shadows and this will of course take some performance if you're making this game for a mobile application you probably don't want to have hard shadows on your point lights or at least you want to be careful with how many you have but on a stationary computer or a modern laptop this should not be a problem whatsoever so I just think it really gives a nice feel you can see all of the bars here shining onto the chairs that looks kind of cool you can see what that does to the environment good so yep that all looks nice and we can go in here and just make sure lighting data set was build with an in yeah we can now get that rid of the by removing the auto here and going clear big data and then choosing Auto again and it's going to auto bake the light map now so that's perfect and where do we want to go from now well I definitely want to have some more light in here but I want to have some flames under the obstacles here some cool flame particles and we'll have them light up the arena as well and we'll have them be animated so that they vary in intensity that's a really nice feel so we'll call this the arena center light and we could make this part of the prefab but I'll just keep it out of it for now just so we preserve the original prefab I don't know it just feels better so let's start by doing that as well okay so the next thing on our list here is setting up the flying platforms because at the moment they look at tiny bit boring so again I want to create these huge flames from underneath and we will of course defy physics on this one but I think it's okay because we do have fighting robots in what looks to be a clash between a scifi and a Roman Stadium so it's not really realism we're going for it anyways so let's go in here and let's find a cool particle effect to work off of and it's just so happens that unity standard acids include some very cool particle effects especially almost there flames that look really nice and that are very easy to edit so let's just use that as a base for what we're going to be making so but I just noticed that we have a bunch of scripts down here cluttering everything so I'll just take all the scripts into the scripts folder and the room list item into the prefabs just to clean this up a bit because we are we do have a lot of stuff in here and I also have a main level 1 folder I don't know why it's there but we should definitely delete it okay so I know standard assets particle systems and then prefabs you should see a fire complex prefab and that's what I want to use again if you don't have this simply run I click in the project panel go import package and then particle systems and you can make sure that it's imported there but for now we are just going to whoops not prefabs be using it here and let's take it and drag it into the scene and let's find it here let's reset that in the inspector and yep so that's cool and we can delete this script here that is currently missing we don't need that and I don't think we need to multiply this I actually like the default look so that's fine and you can go ahead and select the different particle systems to see them playing or we could just go ahead and hit the play button kind of to see what this file looks like and you can see it has this really nice realistic look where the light is animated in such a way that's actually done using a script that it both varies in intensity and moves around to give a very cool looking a lively fire effect so what we are going to do here is first off we are going to boost the range of this light to something like 10 and I don't think we need to edit the color or the intensity so we'll just leave those as is and then we can um what we basically want to do is we want to flip this effect on its head because we wanted to appear that the fire is coming from beneath these obstacles so let's go ahead and bring this over to one of the obstacles and we can do that by dragging it under one of the flying platforms and then resetting the transform once again so you can see now it's centered on there and we can maybe move this down a bit and we'll just drag it actually let's just have it be part of the platform for now that's fine so we'll bring it to the very bottom of on the platform and then we'll go and look at on the different effects so when it comes to the light actually let's move the whole thing down so that we assure that when the light moves it doesn't go up into the actual platform and then we can move all of the other effects up as we want to so this actual fire effect almost look looks perfect just as is I really like the glowing effect here and it's fine that it rises we can go ahead and just flip the direction on this actually I really like that so let's just have that be flipped and that's fine and then we can find our flames and these are the ones that we definitely need to edit so let's flip the direction on the 90 degrees there however you can sit still our goes upwards and that's because we need to flip it in here as well so the start rotation here let's make that a constant add on 90 a 180 degrees so you can see that flipped it on its head and now we just need to move it down and also we need to remove the gravity modifier so that it stays in place and now we can move it up so that it fits something like that looks pretty nice I don't want any clipping to occur so just move it below so don't doesn't clip into the platform and I think this looks really great as always spend more time on this than I do please to make it look just right but I don't have infinite time when it comes to modifying this stuff we do need to get on with the tutorial so let's select the eye darksmoke here and that's kind of a crazy effect we have going on here and I actually really like it as is but I think we should maybe move it down a bit just a tad and we'll maybe see the start road and the rotation is actually kind of nice if we flip that 90 degrees I'll go crazy but I actually like that I think it's pretty good what we can also do is go into the force over lifetime and make it not rise up as quickly so bump the Y value down nope I want that to stay but we can maybe do a negative one here I don't want it to just go right on through our surface okay I think we'll keep the original value then it's probably better and then we can take the C value here Z value and bump it down to 0.5 so it doesn't look as crazy I actually kind of like that and we can take the emission and run that down as well so it isn't as crazy something like that looks really nice and we do need to do the same thing with the lit smoke that's this one we can pretty much do that by I think we might be able to just rotate it ah so now it just goes straight up and then we want to rotate it on the whatever here so that's just rotated manually so it follows the other smoke here I think that looks pretty great actually and we can add a okay we'll just use the force of a lifetime and I'll just remove the C value see what that does actually really like that so it there is some wind to it I think that looks kind of cool we'll just keep that in there we can maybe move it over a bit there okay so again spend more time but for now we'll be happy with this maybe move it down a bit as well actually it's more the dark smoke that we need to move down something like that okay cool so we're happy with that and then we'll find the sparks falling here and we want to rotate those as well to just point straight down so I'll just do a zero on the xaxis there and I really like the feel of these however I want them to go slower so let's do something like point point two on the gravity modifier I think that looks really really cool and the sparks rising we don't want them to go straight through but I definitely want to have some sparks rising so what we'll do is we'll add some kind of maybe we'll just flip those somehow change the start speed here to be a constant we can add some speed to those something like that and we can do negative 90 to make them follow our smoke and so it will really appear that the wind is blowing here so I actually really like that however I think it's too much when it comes to the emission so you can go in here and change the curve or we could just on change let's see here that's actually going here and find the curve of this come on on time for some reason it doesn't want to open up my curve editor here that's kind of annoying that's okay what we can do instead is we can simply bump down the color here so we can lessen the Alpha a little bit and I think this will give kind of the effect that we are going for something like that just to not make it as apparent okay I really like that I think that works just fine and again play more around with it now we can take this fire complex and we can duplicate it a bunch of times and move it over to the other platforms as well so I'm just going to snap to the top view here shift to on or auto graphic and move that over there I believe that's flying platform no that's actually that one over there so we'll move that over there duplicated flying platform 3 that's that one so let's move it over there as well I'm doing it this way so that we can preserve the Y positioning and that over to platform 4 which is hopefully that one over there that's perfect coal and the naming here pretty much doesn't matter so we'll have all of those in there and now when we should switch back into our perspective mode and hit play this looks super cool so I really like the effect that we have going here I really like how it's it's very clear with the wind and all of that good so we can save that and on the next thing on list is dust particles are oh actually I wanted to create a hover animation I think you should go ahead and do this yourself because we will run out of time if I need to go in and do this but it is as basic as finding our animation window right here and then adding a new animation clip and simply animating these platforms on the why it's not too difficult it should definitely be doable and what I also do is I'll shift these a bit in height I think that will look cool if we just have them be random Heights here so something like that that looks better okay and then have them hover up and down that would be just to be awesome and your of course stuff definitely free to add obstacles in here I've purposefully made this a very open arena with not a lot of stuff in it so you can go go crazy with um with designing the gameplay on your own yeah so some test particles and these are very easy to add as well let's find the dust storm prefab again under the standard acid particle systems simply drag that in here and I think this is a prefab that looks very cool just right off the bat we'll just change a few settings so it isn't as large so I will find the shape here and make that something like 40 by 40 or 40 by maybe five by 40 that's 50 40 and let's see just in which direction we made our flames blow in the air here so let's see where was it there so let's find our smoke and our sparks there okay so it went in this direction here so I definitely want our particles to go in the same direction and right now I believe yeah they're going in the pretty much opposite direction so let's do a knot on the X let's do this on the Y of 180 on that and maybe just correct it a tiny bit something like that looks a lot better we can also move it over and let's bump down the admission on this to something like forty maybe let's go back into the arena see what it looks like in here I think it gives a really nice feel however I don't want this to affect the gameplay so we'll just drag it up over the game actual gameplay area or over above the ground at least so that down here you won't be affected by the dust underneath if you look up it becomes very clear that that is definitely a thing so I think that looks pretty cool and I just want to change the color of this to tinned it a tiny bit orange ah there and in here there we go I think that looks really really awesome so we'll just keep that in there and have that playing all the time and we also want to check pre won't run prewarm on that so that it is going just when we play the game and the next thing on our list and this is a crazy list I'm just going to have a sip of water our image effects hmm and you can pretty much go completely crazy with image effects you can add a color correction you can add a vignette you can add chromatic aberration now all kinds of stuff but I'm just going to add what I think are the two most essential image effects for making your game look a lot cooler without the user thinking wow this is edited this almost looks like he went into Photoshop and play around with all the colors without it being too distracting and unity of course again has some nice standard assets when it comes to this let's import them by going by right clicking import package and then going effects and it's going to process all them here that's it import and there are a bunch of different effects in here you can pretty much add effects all you want it has a really nice vignette and chromatic aberration if that's and the effect that you're going for and I'm just going to find my scene camera here and edit this and let's bring up the art game view so we can see this applied and the first thing that I want to add is screen space ambient occlusion and also called ssao and this is just a very nice image effect that fakes ambient occlusion by looking pretty much at what the screen is seeing so it's it's adding this into the render pod line instead of rendering it into a light map or baking it into a light map beforehand so it's it's adding it real time so therefore it is a bit of an expensive effect but I think it's so worth it when you when you see it so I'm just going to search for screen space ambient and you want occlusion not obscure in so occlusion here and you can see the nice shadows that this adds it adds shadows wherever to objects or surfaces meet and we definitely want to edit that this a bit we are going to bump down the radius to something a lot smaller here something like um I don't know there looks pretty good the occlusion attends intensity I think is fine it is a pretty high intensity but that's alright so let's just have it be some something like that looks pretty nice and you can of course see it in the scene view so let's just cover this component and add it to a player camera as well so paste the component that's new there and on the player will also add a motion blur and we want that called the one called camera motion blur and I really like the default settings on this one so when we hit play now and jump in here with our character and I think this is the first time we're moving around you can see that we have this these cool shadows and we have the nice effects I actually think the dust storm is just a bit too much and everything else looks really nice and you can see that we can hit everything we can fly past this grid and we are able to fly on top of obstacles so let's let's just try that real quick and you can see there and I was able to fly on top of it even though I kind of failed at it so you can see if we can stand on top of this and everything looks cold so I'm actually really happy with that so we'll keep that I will just go in here and bump the emission on the dust storm down to something like thirty and maybe bring the color down just a bit on the Alpha here you can do that something like that I think that's better we can also take it find it in in our scene here on a dust storm and maybe move it up even a bit more here just so it's an effect to see when we look up and that's perfect and let's go back here and the last thing that we want to do is just set a couple of spawn points inside of our arena that make sense so let's find our first spawn point here that's currently right here and I actually think that that's a fine place for us to spawn but I just want to let's see Center it on the X there and everything else looks fine the second spawn point is over here that's fine as well oops that is centered on the X and we can just move it over here cool and I just want to create a couple more I want to create spawn point three here alright let's actually move this on top of one of the platforms let's Center it out in this on the platform there that looks good let's move it over drag it on top there we go I think that looks really nice and the fourth one here will just position add a nother part of the map just to make it or to confuse the players so they aren't able to just camp one spawn point that would be annoying especially when the map is this small and what you want to do is of course add some obstacles in here to duck behind and maybe have some of the spawn points be behind those obstacles so the so that the players aren't shut immediately after they spawn but I think that will be just fine and I believe that the way that we have said it set up here is that um it will automatically include include those two that we just added so that was the entire list I hope you were able to follow me in all of this stuff I really think on the prod or er the final arena here looks super cool and you should definitely play around with it it's again completely free for you to use so yep that's pretty much it thank you so much to some mean iben for creating this arena it's a amazing job if you want to order on other your arm models he does do client work his are not expensive and he is very kind so I definitely recommend him he's my goto modeler and without further ado thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video thank you so much to all of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in July and a special thanks to vixen Minnesota and UK and Lux game TV these videos wouldn't be possible without you
