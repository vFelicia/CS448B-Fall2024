00:00 - Hey there, future Pythonistas!
00:02 - Ready to embark on your coding journey?
00:04 - Let's get started with Python!
00:07 - Good news!
00:08 - Many PCs and Macs already have Python installed.
00:11 - But let's make sure it's ready to go on your machine.
00:14 - On a Windows PC, just search for 'Python' in the start menu,
00:17 - or open the Command Line and type this command:
00:20 - python --version
00:24 - If Python is installed,
00:26 -  you'll see the version number displayed.
00:28 - Like Python 3.12
00:31 - On Linux or Mac,
00:32 - open your terminal and type the same command.
00:34 - No Python?
00:35 - No problem!
00:36 - Download it for free at python.org
00:39 - Now, let's dive into the fun part!
00:41 - Writing your first Python program!
00:43 - Let's get coding!
00:45 - Open any text editor and create a new file called 'helloworld.py'
00:50 - Start with a classic:
00:51 - print(”Hello, World!”)
00:54 - Save it,
00:54 - Save it, then open your command line
00:56 - and navigate to where you saved your file.
00:58 - Now run the file,
01:00 - by typing python
01:01 - followed by the name of the file
01:03 - Nice!
01:04 - You've just written and executed your first Python program!
01:08 - Awesome job!
01:09 - Keep going, and you'll be a Python pro in no time.
01:12 - Did you know you can run Python code right in your browser?
01:15 - Check out W3Schools' online Python editor.
01:19 - Simply type your code here and hit 'Run'.
01:21 - Let's try it with our 'Hello, World!' example.
01:24 - Hit 'Run' and see the magic happen!
01:27 - That's it!
01:28 - This editor will be your go-to tool
01:29 - as we explore more Python features.
01:32 - Want to test some quick Python code?
01:34 - Let's use the Python command line!
01:36 - Start it with the command "python"
01:38 - or if that doesn't work try
01:40 - "py" or  "python3.12" or whatever version you are using.
01:43 - Now you're in the Python shell.
01:45 - Type our classic 'Hello, World!' example again.
01:48 - See the result instantly!
