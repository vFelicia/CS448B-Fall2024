00:00 - welcome to the w3schools CSS background
00:03 - tutorial CSS background properties are
00:08 - used to set the background of pages and
00:10 - elements Aircel you set the background
00:13 - color of an element in this example we
00:16 - have set the background color of the
00:18 - page you can do this by setting the
00:20 - background color property for the body
00:23 - element in CSS color is usually
00:28 - specified by either a hex value like
00:31 - this or an RGB value like this or a
00:45 - color name like this let's set the
00:52 - background color for this h1 element and
00:55 - this p element as well
01:07 - set the h1 element background color to
01:11 - orange and the background color for the
01:22 - P elemental paragraph to red you can set
01:32 - the background color for almost any
01:34 - element or you can specify an image to
01:41 - use as a background like this the
01:45 - background image is specify with the
01:47 - background image property and the URL of
01:50 - the image you want to use by default the
01:54 - image is repeated so it covers the
01:56 - entire element let's look at the image
01:59 - we used in this example so we see the
02:05 - image we used is pretty small but in our
02:07 - example it's repeated both horizontally
02:10 - and vertically be careful when setting
02:14 - image as a background some images can
02:18 - make the text almost unreadable you see
02:25 - with this background the text is pretty
02:27 - hard to read let's try with a different
02:29 - image
02:37 - this is a gradient image it starts with
02:41 - a purple uh pair and it goes gradually
02:43 - to a white color this image looks pretty
02:46 - strange when it's repeated both
02:47 - horizontally and vertically it would
02:51 - look a lot better if it's repeated only
02:53 - horizontally you can do this by setting
02:56 - the background repeat' property now this
03:10 - looks a lot better set the background
03:12 - repeat' property to repeat X repeat X is
03:17 - four horizontal repeat repeat Y is
03:20 - vertical repeat you can also specify
03:23 - that the background image should not be
03:25 - repeated at all and only be shown once
03:27 - like in this example showing the image
03:31 - only once specified by setting the
03:34 - background repeat' property to no-repeat
03:38 - but in this example the background image
03:41 - is shown in the same place as the text
03:43 - we want to change the position of the
03:46 - image so it doesn't disturb the text too
03:48 - much this is set the background position
03:51 - properly
04:03 - that's better
04:05 - but the image is still disturbing the
04:06 - text let's also add a margin to the
04:10 - right side so that the text will never
04:12 - touch the image now the text will never
04:23 - disturb the image there are many
04:27 - properties to consider when dealing with
04:29 - backgrounds to shorten a code it's also
04:32 - possible to specify all the properties
04:34 - in a single property this is called a
04:36 - shorthand property the short time for
04:40 - background properties is simply
04:41 - background using the background
04:44 - shorthand we set the following
04:46 - properties background color background
04:51 - image background repeat' and background
04:56 - position when using the shorthand
05:02 - property the order of the property
05:04 - values our background color background
05:08 - image background repeat' background
05:12 - attachment and background position
05:16 - doesn't matter if one of the property
05:18 - values are missing as long as the ones
05:20 - that are present are in this order we've
05:23 - gone through all these properties except
05:25 - background attachment this can be used
05:28 - to set a fixed background image this
05:33 - background image will not scroll with
05:35 - the rest of the page its position is
05:38 - fixed that's because of the background
05:40 - attachment property is set to fixed you
05:46 - can set the background attachment
05:47 - property to scroll and the image will
05:52 - scroll with the rest of the page again
05:54 - like this
05:59 - on the w3schools tutorial page lists all
06:05 - the CSS background properties and
06:07 - there's a link for each property that
06:10 - goes to our CSS reference where you can
06:13 - find more information for any CSS
06:15 - property this concludes some tutorial
06:18 - for the CSS background thank you for
06:21 - watching
