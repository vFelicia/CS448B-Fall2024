00:01 - Hello class! Let's talk about the class attribute
00:05 - In HTML you have the opportunity to 
group or classify elements together
00:10 - This is helpful if you want to apply the same 
action for all elements in a specific group
00:16 - Look at this group of people
00:17 - What if we want all the people 
with red shirts to start jumping
00:22 - Hey! Red shirts! Start jumping!
00:26 - In HTML we can use the class 
attribute to group elements
00:32 - For example if we want this group 
of elements to have a red background
00:35 - we add the class attribute 
with the value "my-group"
00:39 - Now these two paragraphs belong to the same class
00:43 - We can use CSS to select these 
elements with the class selector
00:48 - The syntax for the class selector 
is a dot followed by the class name
00:52 - In our example the class name is "my-group"
00:57 - As you can see the two paragraphs 
now have a red background
01:01 - By the way different elements 
can share the same class
01:04 - See now the heading element 
also has a red background
01:10 - because it has the same 
class as the two paragraphs
01:14 - HTML elements can also 
belong to more than one class
01:19 - Just remember to separate 
them with a space like this
01:23 - Now the heading element belongs to both 
the "my-group" class and the "main" class
01:30 - and we'll get the CSS styles from both classes
01:34 - Now class you know about class
01:38 - Goodbye class
