00:00 - now let's look at the rules for writing
00:01 - python starting with indentation in
00:04 - Python indentation is crucial in this
00:07 - example we have an if statement with a
00:09 - second line print 5 is greater than two
00:13 - the second line is indented with four
00:15 - spaces this indentation tells python
00:18 - that the second line is part of the if
00:20 - statement block if you skip the
00:22 - indentation python will throw a syntax
00:24 - error or read them as two different
00:26 - statements so always remember to indent
00:29 - your code properly you can use different
00:31 - numbers of spaces but the standard is
00:33 - four just make sure you're consistent
00:36 - within the same block because python
00:38 - will throw an error if you use different
00:39 - numbers of spaces within the same block
