00:00 - welcome to the W3 schools CSS selector
00:04 - tutorial CSS selectors allow you to
00:07 - select and style HTML
00:10 - elements selectors are used to find
00:13 - elements based on their ID classes types
00:19 - attributes values of attributes and much
00:22 - more let's go through the most common
00:25 - selectors the element selector selects
00:29 - elements based on the element
00:34 - name this is the CSS selector it is set
00:39 - to P that means it will select all P
00:42 - elements on the page like
00:45 - this so it Styles all P elements to be
00:49 - Center aligned and have a red
00:54 - color but if we add another element that
00:57 - is not a p element it will not be a Ed
01:00 - by the
01:06 - style see this Dev element was not
01:09 - affected by the
01:12 - style the ID selector uses the ID
01:16 - attribute of an HTML element to find the
01:18 - specific
01:20 - element an ID should be unique within a
01:23 - page so you should use the ID selector
01:26 - when you want to find a single unique
01:28 - element
01:30 - to find an element with a specific
01:32 - ID use a hash character followed by the
01:36 - ID of the
01:38 - element so this style rule will be
01:41 - applied to the HTML element with ID
01:44 - equals power
01:48 - one if we add an ID to the second
01:54 - element and change the
01:57 - selector to match the new ID the other
02:00 - element will be affected by the
02:03 - style like
02:07 - this the class selector finds element
02:10 - with a specific class set by the HTML
02:14 - class
02:16 - attribute to select elements with a
02:18 - specific
02:19 - class use a period character followed by
02:24 - the name of the class so this style will
02:27 - be applied to HTML elements with
02:30 - class equals
02:33 - Center or you can specify that only
02:35 - specific HTML elements should be
02:37 - affected by a class by including the
02:39 - element name so if we set p period
02:44 - Center only P elements with class equal
02:47 - Center will be
02:50 - affected like
02:54 - this you can also add multiple classes
02:57 - to an
02:58 - element so if if we create a separate
03:03 - style rule
03:05 - for
03:10 - color see now we have a style rule for
03:14 - Center and a style rule for
03:18 - color and
03:21 - remove the element
03:26 - selector and add a second class to the h
03:29 - one
03:31 - element see both elements are affected
03:34 - by the center style rule but only the H1
03:38 - is affected by the color style rule
03:40 - since it has class equal Center and
03:46 - color in Styles sheets there are often
03:49 - elements using the same
03:54 - style for example here we have the same
03:58 - style for the H1 H2 and P
04:03 - element to minimize the code you can
04:06 - group
04:07 - selectors to group selectors separate
04:10 - each selector with a
04:13 - comma here we have grouped selectors for
04:18 - H1 H2 and P elements so the style is
04:24 - applied to H1 H2 and P elements
04:30 - this works with all kinds of selectors
04:33 - so if we remove the H2 and P element
04:39 - selectors and add an
04:43 - ID to the P element so we
04:49 - can group selectors for H1
04:54 - and elements with ID para one
05:05 - so this works with any kind of selector
05:07 - element selectors ID selectors class
05:10 - selector or any other
05:13 - selector this concludes our tutorial for
05:15 - CSS selectors thank you for watching
