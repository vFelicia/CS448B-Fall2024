00:00 - welcome to the w3schools CSS tables
00:04 - tutorial the look of an HTML table can
00:07 - be greatly improved with CSS let's start
00:11 - with table borders to specify table
00:16 - borders in CSS use the border property
00:20 - this example specifies a black border
00:24 - for table table header and table data
00:28 - elements
00:30 - notice that this example has double
00:33 - borders that's because both the table
00:36 - and the table header and data elements
00:38 - have separate orders to display a single
00:43 - border for the table use the border
00:47 - collapse property
01:00 - like this with the border collapse
01:05 - property set to collapse the table
01:08 - borders are collapsed into a single
01:10 - border the width and height of the table
01:16 - is specified by the width and height
01:18 - properties here we've set the width
01:23 - property of the table to a hundred
01:25 - percent so it takes 100% of the
01:28 - available space let's try to change it
01:31 - to a pixel value and the height of the
01:39 - table header is 50 pixels you see here
01:43 - it's a bit much so let's change it to 10
01:47 - pixels
01:55 - the text in a table is aligned using the
01:59 - text align and vertical align properties
02:03 - the text align property sets the
02:06 - horizontal alignment like left right or
02:09 - Center in this example that takes the
02:12 - line property for the table data
02:15 - elements is set to right so the text in
02:19 - the table data elements are right
02:21 - aligned let's try and change it to left
02:28 - now the text is aligned on the left side
02:39 - to set the vertical alignment you can
02:43 - use the vertical align properly it can
02:52 - be set to top like this or middle or
03:05 - bottom
03:14 - to control the space between the border
03:16 - and content of a table you can use the
03:19 - padding property in this example the
03:24 - padding property is set to 15 pixels for
03:27 - the table data element let's try and
03:30 - change it areas with 50 pixels and here
03:43 - it is with zero you can also change the
03:50 - color of the border the text and the
03:52 - background you can change the background
03:56 - color by setting the background color
03:58 - property
04:07 - or you can change the color of the text
04:09 - by setting the color property in this
04:17 - example we used to set the background
04:19 - color and color for the table header
04:22 - element let's set it for the entire
04:25 - table you can also set the color of the
04:33 - border using the border property and if
04:41 - no color is specified for the border it
04:43 - uses the color of the element it's
04:45 - applied to in this example we've set the
04:48 - color text color for the table to maroon
04:51 - so if we remove the color from the
04:55 - border property the border gets a maroon
05:00 - color this concludes our tutorial for
05:05 - CSS tables but on the w3schools tutorial
05:08 - page you can see more examples thank you
05:12 - for watching
