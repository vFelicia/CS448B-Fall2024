00:00 - welcome to the W3 schools CSS pseudo
00:04 - elements tutorial a CSS pseudo element
00:07 - is used to style specified parts of an
00:10 - element for example it can be used to
00:13 - style the first letter or line of an
00:16 - element or insert content before or
00:19 - after the content of an
00:21 - element let's look at an example where
00:24 - we style the first line of an
00:27 - element in this example we us use the
00:30 - first line pseudo element to style the
00:33 - first line of this text see we set it to
00:36 - a red color and it's in small
00:41 - caps the way to add a pseudo element is
00:44 - to added to a
00:47 - selector like this P selector element
00:51 - selector and a studo element always
00:53 - starts with two columns so it's selector
00:57 - colon colon and the pseudo element you
01:00 - want to
01:03 - add the first line pseudo element can
01:06 - only be applied to block elements like
01:09 - this B element and there are some
01:12 - restrictions on what kind of properties
01:14 - that can be used with the first line
01:16 - pseudo
01:17 - element you can use Font
01:21 - properties uh like font size
01:32 - and te most text
01:35 - properties uh like word or letter
01:37 - spacing you can use color and background
01:40 - properties and clear for
01:44 - floating we can also set the first
01:48 - letter Su
01:50 - element uh to apply style to the first
01:56 - letter like this
02:00 - and like first line the first letter
02:02 - pseudo element can only be applied to
02:04 - block
02:05 - elements and there are some restrictions
02:08 - here too you can use the same properties
02:10 - as you can for first line but also
02:13 - margin padding and Border properties and
02:16 - Float but not word and letter spacing
02:19 - since it's just for single
02:24 - character and you can
02:27 - use both first line and first letter at
02:30 - the same time so let's try and style
02:33 - both the first letter and the first
02:44 - line like
02:47 - this and you can use pseudo elements
02:52 - with almost any kind of
02:56 - selector here we set it for uh an
02:59 - element selector with a class
03:02 - selector or we can just remove the class
03:05 - selector and set it for all P
03:09 - elements or we can add an
03:16 - ID and have the pseudo element applied
03:20 - to
03:24 - that like this
03:30 - the before pseudo element can be used to
03:33 - insert content before the content of an
03:36 - element here we've used the before
03:39 - pseudo element to insert an
03:43 - image before each H1 element or that is
03:48 - before the content of each H1 element we
03:52 - can also use it to add text like this
04:08 - and you can use the after pseudo element
04:13 - to insert content after the content of
04:15 - an
04:17 - element like this
04:31 - and the before and after pseudo elements
04:34 - can be used together for example to set
04:48 - quotes using open quote and close
04:57 - quote like this
05:03 - and on the W3 schools tutorial page we
05:06 - list all the CSS pseudo classes and
05:08 - elements and there's a link for each
05:12 - class or element that goes to our CSS
05:14 - reference for that specific class or
05:17 - element this concludes our tutorial for
05:20 - CSS pseudo elements thank you for
