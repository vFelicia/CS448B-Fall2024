With timestamps:

00:00 - Now today we're discussing something 
found in nearly all web pages: Links
00:05 - They allow users to easily click 
their way from page to page
00:10 - To start let's discuss what HTML links are
00:13 - All HTML links are hyper links,
00:17 - they are clickable links that 
jump you to another document
00:21 - When you move the mouse over the link the 
mouse arrow will turn into a little hand
00:26 - Remember a link doesn't have to 
be a text it could be anything
00:30 - an image, a button
00:31 - or even me
00:33 - Now let's go into syntax.
00:36 - Now in HTML all links are defined 
with the  tag like this
00:41 - The href attribute is like the road map it 
specifies the destination address of the link
00:48 - The link text is the visible part
00:51 - Clicking on the visible part then 
send you to the specified address
00:57 - Next we discuss local links
01:00 - The previous examples were using 
absolute URL, AKA a full web address
01:06 - A local link, AKA a link to the same 
website, is specified with a relative URL
01:13 - That means there's no www part like that
01:20 - By default a link will 
appear in one of three ways:
01:24 - An unvisited link is underlined and blue
01:27 - A visited link is underlined and purple
01:30 - An active link is underlined and red
01:33 - But you can change the default colors by using CSS 
to learn more about that head to the CSS tutorial
01:43 - Next let's cover the target attribute.
01:46 - The target attribute specifies 
where to open the linked document
01:50 - It can have one of the following values:
01:57 - "_blank" opens the linked 
document in in a new window or tab
02:03 - "_self" opens the linked document in 
the same window/tab as it was clicked,
02:09 - this is usually the default
02:13 - "_parent" opens the linked 
document in the parent frame
02:19 - "_top" opens the linked document 
in the full body of the window
02:23 - Lastly frame name opens the 
linked document in a named frame
02:30 - But what if you want to use images as links it's 
actually pretty common and should look like this:
02:36 - As you can see we simply wrap the img
element inside an a element
02:44 - You can add a title to a link 
using the title attribute
02:48 - The title attribute specifies 
extra information about an element
02:53 - The information is most often shown as a tool 
tip text when the mouse moves over the element
02:59 - Before we end class,
let's do a quick chapter summary
03:03 - The a element is used to define a link
03:06 - The hrf attribute is used 
to define the link address
03:11 - The target attribute is used to define 
where to open the linked document
03:16 - Using the img element inside an 
a, will define an image as a link
