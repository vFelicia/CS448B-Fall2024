00:00 - welcome to the w3schools CSS horizontal
00:03 - align tutorial in this tutorial I will
00:06 - show you how to horizontally aligned
00:08 - block elements for layout purposes a
00:11 - block element is an element that takes
00:15 - up the full width available as a line
00:17 - break before and after it
00:19 - examples of block elements are H 1 P and
00:24 - div elements let's look at how we can
00:28 - Center align using the margin property
00:32 - block elements can be center-aligned by
00:34 - setting the left and right margins to
00:37 - auto setting the left and right margins
00:41 - to auto specifies that you split the
00:44 - available margin equally result is a
00:48 - centered element you can also use the
00:51 - shorthand property margin which will set
00:56 - all margins to auto and this includes
01:00 - the left and right margin of course
01:04 - Center aligning like this will have no
01:06 - effect if the width is set to 100% since
01:10 - there's no space for aligning
01:21 - let's see how you can left or right
01:24 - align using the position property you
01:29 - can align elements using absolute
01:30 - positioning for this element you set
01:36 - position absolute and placed it zero
01:40 - pixels from the right side let's change
01:45 - it to zero pixels from the left side
01:53 - absolute position elements are removed
01:56 - from the normal flow of the page you can
01:58 - overlap other elements so if we place a
02:04 - V element air see that our absolute
02:09 - position element overlap set
02:18 - when aligning elements like this is
02:21 - always a good idea to predefined margins
02:24 - and padding's for the body element this
02:28 - is to avoid visual differences in
02:31 - different browsers you can see we have a
02:41 - small gap here
02:42 - let's do to the default body margin and
02:49 - in Internet Explorer 8 in earlier
02:51 - versions 17 pixels of margin will be
02:54 - reserved for the scroll bar on the right
02:56 - side unless a doctype declaration is set
03:02 - now let's see how we can left and write
03:05 - a line using the float property this
03:12 - element is pushed as far right as it
03:15 - will go using the float property
03:20 - elements after the floating element will
03:24 - flow around it like this so unlike
03:29 - elements with absolute positioning
03:31 - floated elements are a part of the
03:34 - normal flow of the page start floating
03:39 - it to the left
03:45 - and again it's always a good idea to
03:49 - predefined margin and padding for the
03:52 - body element you see we have a small gap
04:01 - hair and hair due to the default body
04:05 - margin and this concludes our tutorial
04:11 - for Santi aligning block elements with
04:14 - CSS thank you for watching
