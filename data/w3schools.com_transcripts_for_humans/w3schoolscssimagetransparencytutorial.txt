00:00 - welcome to w3schools CSS image opacity
00:04 - or transparency tutorial creating
00:07 - transparent images with CSS is easy just
00:10 - use the opacity property from css3
00:13 - this is a regular image and this is the
00:17 - same image with transparency let's look
00:21 - at the code all major browsers use the
00:26 - opacity property for transparency the
00:29 - opacity property can take values from
00:31 - zero point zero to one point zero a
00:36 - lower value makes the element more
00:39 - transparent and the higher value makes
00:43 - the element less transparent Internet
00:49 - Explorer 8 and earlier versions use
00:52 - filter:alpha opacity this can take a
00:58 - value from 0 to 100 where 0 is full
01:03 - transparency and 100 is no transparency
01:10 - for these images we've used two pseudo
01:13 - class hover to change the transparency
01:16 - when you mouse over the images let's
01:22 - look at the code the first CSS rule is
01:27 - very similar to the code within example
01:29 - 1 in addition we've added what should
01:33 - happen when a user hovers or Mouse's
01:36 - over one of the images in this case we
01:41 - want the image to not be transparent
01:44 - when a user hovers over it
01:47 - CSS for this is opacity equals 1.0 for
01:53 - Internet Explorer 8 and earlier its
01:55 - opacity equals 100 so when we mouse over
02:01 - the image is not transparent but when
02:04 - the mouse pointer moves away from the
02:06 - image the image will be transparent
02:08 - again
02:10 - and changed values set the default do
02:14 - not be transparent and when we hover
02:21 - over the image it's very transparent
02:28 - like this
02:37 - here is some text placed in a
02:40 - transparent box the source code looks
02:44 - like this first we create a development
02:50 - class equals background set this to a
02:55 - fixed width and height set a background
02:57 - image these flowers and a border then we
03:05 - create a smaller div inside the first
03:09 - development set this class to trams box
03:12 - for transparent box as fixed width and
03:16 - height a margin white background color a
03:21 - border and it's transparent inside the
03:28 - transparent div we have a P element with
03:32 - some text in it the text is a bit hard
03:36 - to read so let's make the transparent
03:40 - div a little less transparent how the
03:49 - text is easier to read
03:54 - this concludes our tutorial for CSS
03:58 - image opacity or transparency thank you
