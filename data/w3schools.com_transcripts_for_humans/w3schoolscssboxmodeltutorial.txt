00:00 - welcome to the w3schools CSS box model
00:04 - tutorial think of HTML elements as boxes
00:10 - in CSS box model is used when talking
00:14 - about layout
00:15 - it has margins borders padding and
00:19 - content let's take a look at an example
00:25 - here's a simple page showing how the box
00:28 - model works this is our box it's a
00:33 - development that's been styled to look
00:35 - like this let's look at the different
00:38 - areas of the box this area is called the
00:42 - content it's for text and images appear
00:45 - I can increase the size of this area by
00:48 - setting the width property
00:50 - let's try setting the weight - 400
00:53 - pixels now the width of the box has
00:57 - changed but the height as well that's
01:00 - because we haven't specified height so
01:04 - the content will take as much space as
01:06 - it needs a press specifying height
01:17 - now there's additional space beneath the
01:20 - text since we specified the height of
01:22 - the content this area here is called the
01:27 - padding it clears an area around the
01:31 - content the padding is always
01:34 - transparent let's try changing the size
01:37 - of the padding now I remove the padding
01:44 - and you can see that the text is
01:47 - touching the border let's give it some
01:50 - space again this area is called the
01:57 - border the border goes around the
02:00 - padding and the content set the border
02:04 - to 25 pixels so you can see where it is
02:07 - but this is a bit much let's try
02:09 - changing it to 10 pixels that's better
02:15 - this area is called the margin the
02:19 - margin Clair's an area around the border
02:23 - the margin is always transparent let's
02:27 - try changing the margin size and see
02:29 - what happens now the box has the lot
02:34 - less space around it you can go to w/t
02:39 - schools who's tried editor an experiment
02:41 - with these values to better understand
02:43 - how it works
02:45 - one of the reasons that it's important
02:48 - to understand the box mode so you can
02:50 - set the width and height of an element
02:52 - correctly for all internet browsers it's
02:55 - important to know that when you set the
02:56 - width and height of an element you are
02:59 - in fact setting the width and height of
03:00 - the content area let's look at an
03:03 - example to calculate the full size of an
03:07 - element you must know and correctly set
03:09 - the padding border and margin this image
03:16 - is 350 pixels wide the total width of
03:19 - the box below it is also 350 pixels you
03:23 - see that the edges of the box line up
03:26 - with the edges of the image
03:28 - let's look at the property values the
03:31 - width property is 320 pixels padding is
03:36 - 10 pixels the border property is 5
03:39 - pixels and the margin is set to 0 now
03:43 - looking at these numbers it doesn't seem
03:45 - like it adds up to 350 pixels but let's
03:49 - do the math 320 pixels that's the width
03:53 - property for the content and add 20
03:56 - pixels that's for left and right padding
03:59 - at 10 pixels each add 10 pixels that's
04:04 - for left and right order at 5 pixels
04:06 - each and cero pixels for the margin now
04:12 - 320 plus 20 plus 10 equals 350 pixels if
04:19 - we try to change one of these values
04:21 - like the border you can see that the
04:25 - edges no longer line up so to sum up the
04:36 - total width of an element should be
04:37 - calculated like this width plus left
04:41 - padding plus right padding plus left
04:44 - border plus right border plus left
04:46 - margin plus right margin and the total
04:50 - height of an element should be
04:51 - calculated like this height Plus top
04:55 - padding plus bottom padding plus top
04:57 - border plus bottom border plus top
05:00 - margin plus bottom margin this concludes
05:04 - our tutorial for the CSS box model thank
05:06 - you for watching
