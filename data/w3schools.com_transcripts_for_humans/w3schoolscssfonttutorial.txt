00:00 - welcome to the W3 schools CSS font
00:04 - tutorial CSS font properties Define the
00:08 - font family boldness size and style of
00:12 - the text in CSS there are two types of
00:16 - font family
00:17 - names generic
00:19 - families which is a group of font
00:22 - families with a similar
00:24 - look these are siif sanserif and
00:28 - monospace
00:31 - and font family
00:33 - names which are specific font families
00:36 - like Times New Roman or Ariel or corer
00:42 - new let's look at how they're
00:45 - grouped Times New Roman and Georgia are
00:49 - a part of the SF family Ariel and Verana
00:53 - are part of the Sans
00:56 - family SF fants have small lines
01:00 - at the end of some
01:01 - characters you see here they are marked
01:04 - in
01:07 - red sansor RI
01:09 - fonts they do not have the lines at the
01:12 - end of the characters actually Sans
01:15 - means
01:17 - without monospace fonts like corer new
01:21 - and Luc
01:23 - consoles are fonts where all characters
01:26 - have the same width you can see the
01:29 - difference especially for the r and I
01:32 - here in corer New and R and I in
01:37 - Arial on computer screens some SF fonts
01:41 - are considered easier to read than SF
01:46 - fonts when uh we speak of fonts it's
01:50 - most often the font family we mean and
01:53 - this is set with the font family
01:55 - property when setting the font family
01:58 - property you should set several font
02:00 - names as a fallback system if the
02:03 - browser doesn't support the first font
02:05 - it tries the next you can specify
02:08 - several fonts using a
02:10 - comma start with the font you
02:13 - want and end with a generic family name
02:18 - so the browser can pick a similar font
02:20 - in a generic family if no other fonts
02:22 - are
02:24 - available if the name of the font is
02:27 - more than one word it must be in
02:29 - quotations marks like
02:32 - this let's change this font to
02:41 - Verana let's see what happens if we
02:44 - deliberately misspell the name of the
02:49 - font see it goes to the next fallback
02:52 - font which which is the generic s
02:58 - SF on our tutor tutorial page we have a
03:01 - link to a page listing web safe font
03:05 - combinations but let's move on to font
03:08 - style the font style property is mostly
03:11 - used to specify italic
03:13 - text the font style property supports
03:17 - three
03:18 - values normal which is how the text is
03:21 - shown
03:22 - normally
03:23 - italic which is italic style and oblique
03:30 - which is leaning text this is quite
03:32 - similar to italic but less supported in
03:35 - browsers so let's
03:38 - remove the oblique font
03:42 - style now the paragraph is shown in the
03:45 - default style which is
03:51 - normal the font size property sets the
03:55 - size of the
03:57 - text the font size value can be an
04:00 - absolute or relative
04:03 - value with absolute value you set the
04:06 - text to the specifi size and you do not
04:09 - allow users to change the text size in
04:11 - their
04:13 - browsers absolute size is useful when
04:16 - the physical size of the output is known
04:18 - like when you know exactly how many
04:20 - pixels of width you have
04:22 - available with relative size you set the
04:26 - size relative to the surrounding
04:28 - elements and you allow users to change
04:31 - the text size in their
04:33 - browsers let's look at an example where
04:35 - we set absolute
04:38 - size here we've set the size in
04:46 - pixels this gives us full control of the
04:48 - text
04:49 - size but it does not allow users to
04:52 - resize the text in their
04:55 - browsers however you can still use the
04:58 - zoom tool to resize the entire page like
05:10 - this to allow users to resize the text
05:14 - many developers use eem instead of
05:17 - pixels the EM size unit is recommended
05:20 - by the worldwide Web
05:22 - Consortium one em is equal to the
05:25 - current font size the default text size
05:29 - in browser is 16 pixels so the default
05:32 - size of 1 em is 16
05:36 - pixels so we want this H1 element to
05:40 - have a size of 40 pixels but we want to
05:43 - set it with
05:45 - em so in our comment here we've shown
05:48 - how to calculate from pixels to em you
05:51 - divide the pixels by
05:55 - 16 so in this example the text size is
05:59 - the same as the previous
06:01 - example however with the EM size it's
06:05 - possible to adjust the text size in all
06:08 - browsers let show you this in a
06:10 - different
06:15 - browser you see we're not zooming we're
06:18 - changing the text size from medium which
06:21 - is default to
06:24 - largest
06:26 - or to smaller size
06:35 - unfortunately there is still a problem
06:37 - with older versions of Internet Explorer
06:40 - the text becomes larger than it should
06:41 - when made larger and smaller than it
06:44 - should when made smaller the solution to
06:47 - this is to set a default font size for
06:52 - the body
06:56 - element so set the font size to 100%
07:00 - for the body
07:03 - element now with this code the text is
07:07 - the same size in all major browsers and
07:10 - it allows users to resize the text or
07:13 - Zoom the
07:16 - page let's see how we can set the
07:18 - boldness of the
07:20 - text in this example we use the F weight
07:24 - property to set the boldness of the
07:26 - text you can set it to normal
07:31 - bold or
07:35 - Bolder
07:37 - lighter or a number from 100 to 900
07:42 - where 400 is the same as
07:47 - normal and 700 is the same as
07:55 - bold the difference between the weight
07:58 - settings for this depends on the font
08:01 - you
08:03 - use on the W preschool tutorial page
08:06 - there are more examples and we list all
08:10 - the CSS font properties and there's a
08:13 - link for each property that goes through
08:15 - our CSS reference where we can find more
08:18 - information for any CSS property this
08:22 - concludes our tutorial for CSS font
08:25 - thank you for watching

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to the W3 schools CSS font tutorial CSS font properties Define the font family boldness size and style of the text in CSS there are two types of font family names generic families which is a group of font families with a similar look these are siif sanserif and monospace and font family names which are specific font families like Times New Roman or Ariel or corer new let's look at how they're grouped Times New Roman and Georgia are a part of the SF family Ariel and Verana are part of the Sans family SF fants have small lines at the end of some characters you see here they are marked in red sansor RI fonts they do not have the lines at the end of the characters actually Sans means without monospace fonts like corer new and Luc consoles are fonts where all characters have the same width you can see the difference especially for the r and I here in corer New and R and I in Arial on computer screens some SF fonts are considered easier to read than SF fonts when uh we speak of fonts it's most often the font family we mean and this is set with the font family property when setting the font family property you should set several font names as a fallback system if the browser doesn't support the first font it tries the next you can specify several fonts using a comma start with the font you want and end with a generic family name so the browser can pick a similar font in a generic family if no other fonts are available if the name of the font is more than one word it must be in quotations marks like this let's change this font to Verana let's see what happens if we deliberately misspell the name of the font see it goes to the next fallback font which which is the generic s SF on our tutor tutorial page we have a link to a page listing web safe font combinations but let's move on to font style the font style property is mostly used to specify italic text the font style property supports three values normal which is how the text is shown normally italic which is italic style and oblique which is leaning text this is quite similar to italic but less supported in browsers so let's remove the oblique font style now the paragraph is shown in the default style which is normal the font size property sets the size of the text the font size value can be an absolute or relative value with absolute value you set the text to the specifi size and you do not allow users to change the text size in their browsers absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known like when you know exactly how many pixels of width you have available with relative size you set the size relative to the surrounding elements and you allow users to change the text size in their browsers let's look at an example where we set absolute size here we've set the size in pixels this gives us full control of the text size but it does not allow users to resize the text in their browsers however you can still use the zoom tool to resize the entire page like this to allow users to resize the text many developers use eem instead of pixels the EM size unit is recommended by the worldwide Web Consortium one em is equal to the current font size the default text size in browser is 16 pixels so the default size of 1 em is 16 pixels so we want this H1 element to have a size of 40 pixels but we want to set it with em so in our comment here we've shown how to calculate from pixels to em you divide the pixels by 16 so in this example the text size is the same as the previous example however with the EM size it's possible to adjust the text size in all browsers let show you this in a different browser you see we're not zooming we're changing the text size from medium which is default to largest or to smaller size unfortunately there is still a problem with older versions of Internet Explorer the text becomes larger than it should when made larger and smaller than it should when made smaller the solution to this is to set a default font size for the body element so set the font size to 100% for the body element now with this code the text is the same size in all major browsers and it allows users to resize the text or Zoom the page let's see how we can set the boldness of the text in this example we use the F weight property to set the boldness of the text you can set it to normal bold or Bolder lighter or a number from 100 to 900 where 400 is the same as normal and 700 is the same as bold the difference between the weight settings for this depends on the font you use on the W preschool tutorial page there are more examples and we list all the CSS font properties and there's a link for each property that goes through our CSS reference where we can find more information for any CSS property this concludes our tutorial for CSS font thank you for watching
