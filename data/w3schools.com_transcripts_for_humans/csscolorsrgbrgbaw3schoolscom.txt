00:26 - In CSS, we can use RGB values to mix colors
00:30 - For example, RGB(255, 0, 0) gives us bright red!
00:35 - Each color can have a value from 0 to 255
00:38 - 0 means no light, and 255 means full blast!
00:43 - Mixing these up, we can create magical colors
00:46 - Like rgb(255 , 99, 71), a beautiful tomato red.
00:53 - What happens if we mix the colors evenly?
00:56 - We get shades of gray

01:02 - That's where RGBA comes in
01:04 - It adds an 'alpha' value for opacity.
01:08 - The alpha value can be anything from 0.0, totally invisible,
01:12 - to 1.0, completely solid.
01:15 - Let's try RGBA(255, 99, 71, 0.5)
01:22 - for a semi-transparent tomato red.

Today, we're diving into the colorful world of CSS Learning about RGB and RGBA colors Imagine you have three flashlights One red, one green, and one blue. RGB stands for these three colors. R is Red, G is Green and B is Blue By mixing these, we can create almost any color we can think of! In CSS, we can use RGB values to mix colors For example, RGB(255, 0, 0) gives us bright red! Each color can have a value from 0 to 255 0 means no light, and 255 means full blast! Mixing these up, we can create magical colors Like rgb(255 , 99, 71), a beautiful tomato red. What happens if we mix the colors evenly? We get shades of gray But what if we want to play with transparency? That's where RGBA comes in It adds an 'alpha' value for opacity. The alpha value can be anything from 0.0, totally invisible, to 1.0, completely solid. Let's try RGBA(255, 99, 71, 0.5) for a semitransparent tomato red. And that's the magic of RGB and RGBA colors in CSS. You can now paint your websites in any color and transparency you like. Experiment and have fun! Thanks for watching!
