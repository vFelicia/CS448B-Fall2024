00:03 - gallery tutorial CSS can be used to
00:07 - style a page to show an image
00:10 - gallery let's look at the
00:13 - code here we have a styled image gallery
00:17 - if we click one of these small images we
00:20 - get a new page with a larger
00:23 - image let's remove the style and start
00:26 - over so we can see how it
00:28 - works
00:39 - now we have a bunch of unstyled
00:43 - developments with a
00:45 - link an
00:47 - image and an image
00:51 - description so let's start by setting
00:53 - the WID and height of all the containing
00:56 - divs like this
00:58 - one okay so we set
01:01 - the width property to 130
01:07 - pixels and the
01:10 - height 250
01:16 - pixels so let's set uh border margin and
01:20 - padding so we can easier see what we're
01:23 - working
01:28 - with
01:45 - okay now let's Center align the content
01:49 - of the containing
01:58 - divis and Float all the
02:03 - divs next to each other set float
02:11 - left now we're getting closer to what we
02:15 - want um let's set
02:18 - some
02:20 - margin around these images since they're
02:23 - a bit close to the top
02:28 - here
02:34 - let's style the description text as well
02:37 - we'll start by Center aligning
02:48 - it and give it a fixed
02:55 - WID and the same
02:58 - margin as the
03:03 - image now I want to add an effect when
03:06 - we Mouse over the divs so we can see
03:09 - what we are
03:11 - selecting going to change this Hoover
03:13 - effect cuz I want to style the
03:14 - containing div and not the link
03:16 - itself so I set the Hoover effect for
03:22 - the
03:23 - div and I want to change the background
03:28 - color
03:31 - to light
03:37 - blue now we can clearly see which image
03:41 - we're selecting when we
03:44 - Hoover now we have a CSS styled image
03:48 - gallery where the containing elements
