00:05 - Think of variables as containers for storing data values.
00:09 - In Python,
00:10 - creating a variable is as simple as assigning a value to it.
00:15 - Here's an example:
00:17 - In this code,
00:18 - x is a variable that holds the number 5, which is an integer
00:21 - And y is a variable that holds the text 'John', which is a string
00:27 - Python doesn't need a special command to declare a variable.
00:31 - It's created the moment you assign it a value.
00:36 - Variables in Python are dynamic.
00:39 - They don't need to be of a specific type
00:41 - and can change type after being set
00:45 - Here, x starts as an integer with the value 4,
00:48 - then changes to a string with the value “Sally”.
00:54 - If you want to specify the data type of a variable,
00:56 - you can use casting:
00:59 - This way, you can control the data type of your variables.
01:05 - Want to know the type of a variable?
01:07 - Use the type() function:
01:10 - Here, type(x) returns class “str”.
01:12 - type(y) returns class “int”,
01:14 - and type(z) returns class “float”.
01:18 - In Python, strings can be declared
01:21 - with either single or double quotes:
01:24 - Both lines do the same thing.
01:26 - It's up to you which style you prefer.
01:29 - Remember, variable names in Python are case-sensitive.
01:33 - That means “a”
01:34 - and “A” are different variables:
01:37 - In this case, “a” holds the integer 4,
01:40 - and “A” holds the string “Sally”.
01:43 - One doesn't overwrite the other.
01:46 - And that's a wrap on Python variables!
01:50 - Keep practicing, and you'll be a Python pro in no time.

Hey there coders! Today we're exploring Python variables. Think of variables as containers for storing data values. In Python, creating a variable is as simple as assigning a value to it. Here's an example In this code, x is a variable that holds the number 5, which is an integer And y is a variable that holds the text 'John', which is a string Python doesn't need a special command to declare a variable. It's created the moment you assign it a value. Variables in Python are dynamic. They don't need to be of a specific type and can change type after being set Here, x starts as an integer with the value 4, then changes to a string with the value “Sally”. If you want to specify the data type of a variable, you can use casting This way, you can control the data type of your variables. Want to know the type of a variable? Use the type() function Here, type(x) returns class “str”. type(y) returns class “int”, and type(z) returns class “float”. In Python, strings can be declared with either single or double quotes Both lines do the same thing. It's up to you which style you prefer. Remember, variable names in Python are casesensitive. That means “a” and “A” are different variables In this case, “a” holds the integer 4, and “A” holds the string “Sally”. One doesn't overwrite the other. And that's a wrap on Python variables!
