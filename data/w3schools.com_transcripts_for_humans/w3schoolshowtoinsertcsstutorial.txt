00:00 - welcome to the W3 schools tutorial on
00:03 - how to insert
00:05 - CSS when a browser reads A stylesheet it
00:08 - will display the document according to
00:10 - the information in the stylesheet but
00:13 - there are three ways of inserting
00:15 - style external
00:18 - stylesheet internal
00:20 - stylesheet and inline
00:24 - style an external stylesheet is a
00:27 - stylesheet stored in a file this is
00:30 - ideal when style is used by many
00:33 - pages with an external stylesheet you
00:36 - can change the look of an entire website
00:39 - just by changing one
00:41 - file the correct way to link to a
00:44 - stylesheet is with a link element placed
00:47 - in the head section of the page set the
00:51 - real attribute to
00:53 - stylesheet the type attribute to text
00:56 - CSS and the hre attribute to the URL of
01:00 - the style you want to
01:02 - use you must include the link
01:06 - element in every page you want to use
01:08 - the style
01:09 - in here is an example of an external
01:13 - stylesheet here you can see there are
01:16 - styles for the background color and the
01:19 - color and margin of the H1
01:22 - elements an external stylesheet file
01:25 - like this can be written in any text
01:27 - editor like notepad and should only
01:29 - include to CSS code and it must be saved
01:33 - with a CSS file
01:36 - extension now an internal stylesheet
01:39 - should be used when setting the style
01:41 - for a single
01:43 - document you define the internal Styles
01:46 - in the head section of the HTML page
01:49 - inside a style
01:51 - tag here you can see styles for
01:53 - background color and the color and
01:57 - margin of the H1 element
02:00 - we can change the background color like
02:12 - this inline styles are set directly on
02:15 - the tag you want to style this loses
02:18 - many of the advantages with the
02:20 - stylesheet since we mixing content and
02:23 - presentation you should use this method
02:26 - sparingly you can see that the style is
02:28 - set directly on relevant element using
02:31 - the style
02:33 - attribute you set the color and margin
02:36 - for this H1
02:38 - element you can change it like
02:50 - this if a style has been set for the
02:53 - same selector in different
02:55 - stylesheets the values from the most
02:58 - specific style will be used
03:00 - for example our external stylesheet my
03:04 - style.css which we saw earlier has the
03:06 - following properties for the H1 selector
03:10 - color Navy and margin left 20
03:14 - pixels now assume that an internal sty
03:17 - sheet has set the color to Orange for
03:21 - the H1 selector what will happen if we
03:24 - use both these stylesheets on the same
03:26 - page the external stylesheet had the
03:29 - color
03:30 - of this element set to Navy a dark blue
03:33 - color and a left margin of 20
03:37 - pixels but the text has inherited the
03:40 - left margin from the external Styles
03:43 - sheet but replaced the color with the
03:46 - one specified in the internal Styles
03:52 - sheet so multiple Styles will Cascade
03:55 - into one you can specify Styles directly
03:59 - in inside an HTML
04:01 - element or inside the head section of an
04:04 - HTML page or in an external CSS file but
04:10 - how do we know which style will be used
04:12 - when there's more than one style
04:14 - specified for an HTML
04:17 - element generally speaking we can say
04:19 - that all the Styles will Cascade into a
04:22 - new virtual style sheet where the
04:26 - browser default has the lowest priority
04:29 - then the external
04:31 - stylesheet then the internal
04:34 - stylesheet and inline style as the
04:37 - highest
04:38 - priority so an inline style will
04:41 - override a style defined inside the head
04:44 - tag or in an external Styles sheet or a
04:48 - browser default
04:50 - value in this page we have set the
04:53 - background color in line directly on the
04:56 - body
04:57 - element and then in
05:00 - in the style
05:02 - tag and in an external Styles sheet
05:05 - let's see how it works the background
05:08 - color showing now is a light
05:11 - Canan specified inline directly on the
05:15 - body
05:16 - element if we remove
05:20 - that the background color specified in
05:23 - the internal Styles sheet will
05:25 - show if we remove
05:28 - that the background color specified in
05:31 - the external stylesheet will
05:34 - show if we remove that the browser
05:38 - default will
05:41 - show let's set some of these styles
05:52 - again earlier I said that internal
05:56 - stylesheet has a higher priority than
05:59 - external stylesheet this isn't always
06:01 - the case if the link to the external
06:06 - stylesheet is placed
06:09 - after the internal stylesheet the
06:12 - external Styles sheet will override the
06:14 - internal
06:15 - stylesheet like
06:17 - this this is useful to know but it's not
06:21 - how CSS is normally
06:24 - used and this concludes our tutorial on
06:27 - how to insert CSS thank you for watching

welcome to the W3 schools tutorial on how to insert CSS when a browser reads A stylesheet it will display the document according to the information in the stylesheet but there are three ways of inserting style external stylesheet internal stylesheet and inline style an external stylesheet is a stylesheet stored in a file this is ideal when style is used by many pages with an external stylesheet you can change the look of an entire website just by changing one file the correct way to link to a stylesheet is with a link element placed in the head section of the page set the real attribute to stylesheet the type attribute to text CSS and the hre attribute to the URL of the style you want to use you must include the link element in every page you want to use the style in here is an example of an external stylesheet here you can see there are styles for the background color and the color and margin of the H1 elements an external stylesheet file like this can be written in any text editor like notepad and should only include to CSS code and it must be saved with a CSS file extension now an internal stylesheet should be used when setting the style for a single document you define the internal Styles in the head section of the HTML page inside a style tag here you can see styles for background color and the color and margin of the H1 element we can change the background color like this inline styles are set directly on the tag you want to style this loses many of the advantages with the stylesheet since we mixing content and presentation you should use this method sparingly you can see that the style is set directly on relevant element using the style attribute you set the color and margin for this H1 element you can change it like this if a style has been set for the same selector in different stylesheets the values from the most specific style will be used for example our external stylesheet my style.css which we saw earlier has the following properties for the H1 selector color Navy and margin left 20 pixels now assume that an internal sty sheet has set the color to Orange for the H1 selector what will happen if we use both these stylesheets on the same page the external stylesheet had the color of this element set to Navy a dark blue color and a left margin of 20 pixels but the text has inherited the left margin from the external Styles sheet but replaced the color with the one specified in the internal Styles sheet so multiple Styles will Cascade into one you can specify Styles directly in inside an HTML element or inside the head section of an HTML page or in an external CSS file but how do we know which style will be used when there's more than one style specified for an HTML element generally speaking we can say that all the Styles will Cascade into a new virtual style sheet where the browser default has the lowest priority then the external stylesheet then the internal stylesheet and inline style as the highest priority so an inline style will override a style defined inside the head tag or in an external Styles sheet or a browser default value in this page we have set the background color in line directly on the body element and then in in the style tag and in an external Styles sheet let's see how it works the background color showing now is a light Canan specified inline directly on the body element if we remove that the background color specified in the internal Styles sheet will show if we remove that the background color specified in the external stylesheet will show if we remove that the browser default will show let's set some of these styles again earlier I said that internal stylesheet has a higher priority than external stylesheet this isn't always the case if the link to the external stylesheet is placed after the internal stylesheet the external Styles sheet will override the internal stylesheet like this this is useful to know but it's not how CSS is normally used and this concludes our tutorial on how to insert CSS thank you for watching
