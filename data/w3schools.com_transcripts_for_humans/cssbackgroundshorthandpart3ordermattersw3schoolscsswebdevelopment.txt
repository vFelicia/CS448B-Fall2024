00:01 - in this shorthand the order matters
00:03 - first we mention the color then the

00:07 - lastly it's position if we miss any
00:10 - that's okay just keep the
00:12 - order you may even have noticed that we
00:14 - did not set a value for background
00:16 - attachment in the example but that is
00:18 - fine as long as the values we do use are
00:21 - in the correct order
