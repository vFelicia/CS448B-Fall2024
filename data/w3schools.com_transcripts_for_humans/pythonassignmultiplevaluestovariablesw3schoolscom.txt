00:02 - Today, we'll learn some cool tricks
00:04 - on how to assign multiple values in Python.
00:07 - Ready? Let's go!
00:09 - First up, let's see how Python lets you assign values
00:12 - to multiple variables in a single line!
00:14 - Here, we have three variables:
00:16 - x, y, and z.
00:18 - And we're assigning them
00:19 - 'Orange', 'Banana', and 'Cherry' all in one go!
00:22 - Pretty neat, right?
00:23 - But remember,
00:24 - the number of variables must match the number of values,
00:27 - or you'll get an error.
00:30 - Next, let's see how you can assign the same value
00:33 - to multiple variables in one line.
00:35 - Here, x, y, and z
00:37 - are all assigned the value 'Orange'.
00:39 - Simple and efficient!
00:41 - Now, let's move on to something called unpacking a collection.
00:44 - This is where the magic happens.
00:47 - We've got a list of fruits,
00:48 - and we're unpacking it into variables x, y, and z.
00:51 - Voila! Each variable gets a value from the list.
00:56 - And that's it for today!
00:57 - You've learned how to assign multiple values to variables,
01:01 - assign one value to multiple variables,
01:03 - and unpack collections in Python.
