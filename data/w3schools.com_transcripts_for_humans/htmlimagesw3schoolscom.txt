00:02 - Greetings! Today's lesson:
00:04 - Images
00:07 - Images can improve the design and 
the appearance of your web page
00:11 - Especially if they are pictures of majestic things
00:15 - See these?
00:16 - Well they actually look like this
00:19 - Let's take a look at what that means
00:22 - In HTML images are defined with the  tag
00:26 - The image tag has no closing tag 
and is what we call an empty tag
00:33 - But it should contain attributes
00:36 - The src attribute specifies 
the URL or source of the image
00:41 - Next let's go over the alt attribute
00:44 - It provides an alternative text for an image
00:47 - This is helpful if the user cannot view 
the image because of slow connection,
00:51 - error in the src attribute ,
00:53 - or the user has a screen reader
00:56 - The value of the alt attribute 
should describe the image.
01:01 - So if a browser cannot show the image it'll 
display the value of the alt attribute instead
01:07 - And the alt attribute is 
required for images in HTML
01:11 - A web page will not validate correctly without it
01:15 - Next, image sizes.
01:17 - When you start to deal with 
the image's width or height
01:20 - use the style attribute to specify it
01:23 - It should look like this
01:27 - Another way to handle this is to use 
the width and and height attributes
01:33 - Make sure to note that you should always 
specify the width and height of the image
01:38 - If they aren't specified the page 
might flicker while the image loads
01:43 - While the width height and style 
attributes are all valid in HTML5
01:48 - we suggest using the style attribute
01:52 - Now moving back to the src attribute and 
finding the specific location of an image
02:00 - If not specified the browser expects to find 
the image in the same folder as the web page
02:05 - But it's common to store images in a subfolder
02:09 - To do so you must include the 
folder name in the src attribute
02:13 - Another way to store images is on image servers
02:16 - You can access the images from 
any web address in the world
02:20 - You can also use animated images
02:23 - No matter how you pronounce them HTML 
allows animated gifs and gifs like this
02:29 - But what if you want to use an image as a link?
02:32 - Just put the  tag 
inside the  tag like this
02:41 - To make an image float to the right or 
left of a text use the CSS float property.
02:47 - Like this
02:50 - Want to learn more? Float 
over to the CSS float tutorial
02:56 - Sorry I couldn't help myself
02:59 - But what if you wanted your image to 
be less functional and more aesthetic?
03:03 - Namely a background image to be precise
03:07 - To do that on an HTML element use 
the CSS property background-image
03:12 - Which works like this.
03:15 - If you only want the background 
image on a paragraph specify the
03:19 - background-image property on the P element
03:22 - This is covered in depth in 
the CSS background tutorial
03:26 - Now we've covered a lot in this 
chapter but here's one final tip
03:31 - Loading images takes time, and large images 
can slow down your page so use them carefully
03:37 - But some are worth it
