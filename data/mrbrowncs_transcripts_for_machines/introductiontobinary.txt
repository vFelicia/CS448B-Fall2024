hey this is an instruction to binary for binary numbering system and then we'll look at some units and the following videos are going to be about how data is represented in the computer in binary so different types of data we first need to go through it authoritative new more systems and library systems so in everyday life we use decimal also known as deanery in this topic so exact concentric decimal Deanery what we use normally so technically speaking it's a base ten numbering system and that means we have ten digits we use zero through two nine so 10 in total and the base comes from whenever an exponent the number have a bottom is the base and wherever's raised to is the exponent and if we go back to place value so we're talking in primary school maths here would you don't really think about because it's too basic but it is important for this topic for column names go up by a factor of 10 each time so really this is saying 10 0 ie 1 anything to power 0 is 1 and then ten for one obviously is 10 and increases Soviets friend goes up 1 each type of base remains the same so what we're only saying is you've got 9 thousands here for hundreds 10 fives and six ones and add together you get a number so this is important when we talk about binary because binary is a base to system meaning it's got only two digits 0 1 so although 2 used or stored in the computer is represented by binary digits shortened to bits so a bit is either 0 or 1 and all inputs to computer have to be converted to binary to be used to be executed which we processed that's what following videos are all about representing data different types of data in binary so we are going to look at representing numbers of course but because binary does not only website numbers it represents all types of data images videos and so on it's better to think of 1 and 0 as symbols representing true or false and this allows us to do something called boolean algebra which we logic as we've talked about and is replicated in a computer with two different voltage levels so it can be on and off on being for one and off being for 0 being reality is probably more like two different voltage levels so 10 volts and 5 volts and that's why we use binary with computers basically because it's so simple to do we could use base 10 refugees decimal but we need 10 or 10 different voltage levels and sant√© logic we can do in binary which we can't do in decimal one of the reasons I was about to think of bits as symbols is because depending on the context one bit pattern ie a string of bits could represent a number character different types of data basically so this bit pattern just a long stream of bits 0 and ones this could be anything with no idea it could be a number it could be an instruction depending on the context is better to think of it not as numeric values but as things would represent other data so just to look at some units for binary so a way to express an amount of binary numbers so a bit is a fundamental unit you can't get in smaller than a bits it's either 0 or 1 a nibble is 4 bits so you've got to be careful in if you're thinking it in terms of a number you can get rid of the leading 0 but don't do that because again we're thinking of it in terms of symbol so 0 doesn't mean something so 4 bits together then you have a byte which is Labor of a capital B was not really simple for nibble and this is 8 bits usually we're using by it's not really using nibbles but often we so you have a group of 8 bits here but often more leave a space in between each nibble for reasons we'll come on to do it to do effects Edessa more now it becomes more confusing than it should be really we have a kilobyte which is a lowercase K and then capital B and this is a thousand bytes then you have a megabyte which is a capital m and a capital B and is a thousand kilobytes so each got by files at each time but the issue is unfortunately there's two kind of ways of dealing with these larger sizes so whoever came up with these so kilo and mega come from physics right but physics deals with decimal not binary so physics is in terms of tens whereas binaries in terms of two's which makes things difficult so actually we're now we now should be using sizes called using binary prefixes so like a kibbeh byte as k ib is 1,024 bytes and this is correct you you never really get a thousand bytes due to where barney works you're always gonna have the closest number you're gonna have is a thousand 24 but I fortunately ever adapted this weirdo for computer science did this cool as those who trouble down the line by adopting the physics instead of defining it as it should be which 2024 and likewise there's an equivalent one for four megabytes I am maybe byte MIB which is a thousand twenty four QB bytes so a similar theme goes along you have a gigabyte which is a thousand megabytes you have a gig a gigabyte which is a thousand twenty four maybe bytes you have a terabyte thousand gigabytes at EBI by 2024 gigabytes and then you have a petabyte which is thousand terabytes and a peppy byte which is 1,024 terabytes so the binary prefix is definitely sound pathetic but these are actually the correct ones basically so if you see megabyte you should assume it's a thousand kilobytes and not a thousand twenty four kilobytes so far people often get this wrong so all we do is grow by a thousand each time make sure you remember the order so it's the same order K mg TB is the same auditor for names and the symbols vary a little bit
