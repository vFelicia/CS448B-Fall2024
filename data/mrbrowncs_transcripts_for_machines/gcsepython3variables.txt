hello we are now going to look at how variables are used in Python the variable was at crop up everywhere in python and all of our future videos will rely on these as well we are going to stick to using an interactive shell just for this demonstration because we're still sort of trying stuff out and a lot of the early programming is is playing around so please please be trying for questions be trying for stuff I'm showing you learn just be sat there watching it's important to play around and try stuff out so I Michelle was really good for us so let me just drag this over so I've got a bit more space to do this I apologize it's a bit small it become bigger in the next few videos so I've got my my prompt here I can start typing some code so we did last video we'll just do some basic arithmetic operations that were like 5 times 10 the Asterix being multiplication first times 10 is 50 I press ENTER on my keyboard and for code runs line by line I want to did my calculation that result 50 was just shown to me underneath my input like that but what if I want to store that result so we can store results using something called variables and the syntax for variables in Python for syntax being vowels of Python is you have a name so let's call this result you have 8 space or you should do a space and an equal sign and then have a space and then you write your result so in this case the results because for 50 here and then press Enter and nothing happens this time you have no output from his code because all we're doing is storing 50 under the name result so result is our first variable like so if I now type in results and press Enter I get 50 back so 50 has been stored under the name result and that name is within reason anything we wanted to be we can't do certain things like we're not allowed to have say a number starting off our name like this if we have 5 result for some reason and in set the 50 press ENTER I get an error I get a syntax error I've broken visuals of Python I'm not allowed to start off with a number it's just how Python works I'm also not allowed to do to several words too funny some like my result equals 50 press ENTER again in various in tax on breaking for was a Python it's got to be one word to get around this if you have if you particularly want to give it one word Meital words can perform as one you could just leave my results like that or I like to to make it a bit easier do what we call camelcase in programming we have a lowercase letter first of all which you should do anyway shouldn't really be starting with variables uppercase and you have lowercase and then after your first word you do uppercase like fat so be like a camel's hump you have a logo starting and each word has a capital letter to make it a little bit clearer this will be fine let us just talk about this a little bit so we've got our lowercase words here result equals 50 so this name over here is what we was cool well so first of all it's a variable in this exact case but more generally we would call this an identifier in programming so an identifiers any word we give we as a programmer are giving other language to represent something in this case is a value so 50 here is a value which we are storing under the name result under the identifier result now it's an identifier for us for human the computer doesn't care what we call result doesn't care what we call the variable but it's a good idea to give a a meaningful name otherwise would be really confusing if you called this a b c equals 50 you wouldn't know what it is but result at least tells us for it there's been some calculation in this case 5 times 10 when you are doing this process when we are giving a name and having an equal sign and putting a value on draw a hand side we are said to be assigning assigning this value to the variable to view identifier so until it changes result is always going to effectively be a placeholder for 50 and the key is variable it can vary so i said until we change it we can easily down the line change this variable to something else right now right now result is 50 but if I decide to down the line change 50 to 75 like that we are allowed to vary this is in contrast to what we might call a constant a constant we can't change after we assign it in python there is not a way to do constant in order to have a constant in other languages you can have constants in Python we just have variables which we can change so now if I type the result it gives back to me 75 because that name result is replace holder for 75 which is the last thing assigned to that variable and the very first time we assign a value to a variable it's got its own word this is called initialization in it alaya zation like that for second time so result equals 75 but it's not initializing it because result was previously 50 initialization is only the first assignment to the first assignment so let me clear this and show some examples of variables in action so for example let's have another variable called age age equals that say 40 presenta age is not saved as a variable I can now change this because it's a variable and go age equal to say for age in course so if we want to increase for current value of age we do age equals age plus say 10 if you have aged 10 years it's unlucky presenter now if I type an age age will be 50 because I've used for current value of age as my value and add to 10 to us it's not always just one value on the right hand side we can have an a we have an expression on the right hand side which can be evaluated using some of the operators we look at acting for last video the key thing is in his right hand side which is being assigned to the left hand side not the other way around so I couldn't do say 50 equals age you'll see I get a syntax error the identifier has got to be on the left hand side so in maths vehicle sign is very flexible you can look at it either way right but in computer science for direction matters or at least in variable assignment it's just for Python is using the equal sign to do this assignment the left hand side is for variable name I have shown how variables can be used to store values store data but also very was really important when you are programming a proper program sometimes it can seem a bit pointless having a variable if you're doing something like in this case foot was 40 plus 10 let's do that you don't need to set say age to be 40 right because you could defend your age plus 10 let's give me as 50 as well setting age as a variable it does not make any difference to that calculation it's just an extra step it's an extra bit of data being stored but variables are really important when you are programming for the future off in fact very very often you're not when you're programming exactly sure what data will be inside your program when it's being used properly maybe you are relying on some user input me before use it's going to input their age and not every users going to be 40 years old so really you'd be sort of leaving age as sort of some question mark really which will come from some input and then you can write your code as if you're using that variable and then the actual value gets inputted during the actual program being used for this try now first of all recommend you play around with some variables especially ones which are relate to your own life so things that your age your birth year and a phone number maybe each one can be very variable if your phone number make sure you don't put say plus four four four start ignore that bit and leave off four first zero which might cause an error question to have a look at these six lines of code see which ones you think are going to cause an error based on what we've looked at which will break the syntax of Python and then try them out to see if you were right or wrong
