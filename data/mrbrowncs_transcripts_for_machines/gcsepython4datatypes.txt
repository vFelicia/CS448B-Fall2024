for a long form I look at variables we're now going to talk about data types we looked in the last video about how there are two main numbers in Python so two main numbers are integers and floats also called reals more generally so an integer is a whole number something like seven or something like minus twelve is an integer there is no fractional part or as a float has this decimal point and a fractional part something like you know seven point two or minus twelve point one has a fractional part it's a float as opposed to an integer now integers and floats are two examples of data types and data types are a really important topic in not only programming also computer science more generally so they're both examples present of course integers and we've got floats two examples of data types but both for numbers these are not the only data types we have in Python we also have characters you also have strings and we also have boolean values as well so let's talk about these one by one a character is any letter number or symbol for example a is a character because it's one letter on its own if I press ENTER after typing an a I get an error it says name error name a is not defined so what it's doing it here is expecting A to B and identify effectively it's expecting a to be a variable so we need to do is four characters and make sure you surround four character the single letter number symbol in quotes so like this double quotes or single quotes you can see when I typed in the single quotes like that and press ENTER it decided to make it into single quotes which is fine eva is okay I personally do double quotes but that's up to you the same idea for numbers if you want a number to be treated as a character as in one snippet of text I'd think of it as you need to put it around quote so if I just type in five and press Enter but also it's fine doesn't cause an error because this five down here is an integer and this five up here is a character now for us as humans for difference between this five miss five is just for quotes which don't mean anything to us but to a computer the computer can do certain things with four five down here that I can't do with a five up here because it's Tweety miss five four quotes as a character not a number it can't do things like division or multiplication or using mod so it needs to limit its operations to the datatype if a new something like five as a character / press Enter I get an error it says we've got unsupported operand types for the division operator STR and int so int is what this side is so the two operands are effectively verb it's a data either side of the operator and the two is an integer and for STR is a string so we'll talk about strings in a second but really it's saying that actually we can't do this operation on a character it just doesn't know how to as 5/2 of course we'll be fine get 2.5 because the two operands are of the same data type errors occur when you try to or mistakingly mix datatypes let's talk about those strings then because they are really smart characters so say hello we did hello world before hello world when it surrounded by quotes either double or single press Enter that's fine but as a string so string as multiple characters put together strings are the datatype before text if we did say hello on its own press Enter again the name hello is not defined because it's expecting that to be a variable which hasn't been initialized yet the datatype dictates the operations we can do on that data and so for example we do hello / again this is going to also cause an exact same error because we can't divide a word by an integer doesn't make sense python is too confused it actually does let you do a few what look like arithmetic operations so timesing by 2 will do hello hello so python is overloaded the operator if you Asterix operator so it works of both integers and strings but obviously in a different way if I did hello as one word like that and plus world as a second word the plus works this operation is called concatenation we put two words together using the addition operator if I have different operands either side of that plus if I do hello Plus 5.5 hello plus a float press ENTER I get an error it can only concatenate string not float to string so again the errors have come from a data type being incorrect and inconsistent the final data type is boolean so boolean value is either true or false and so in Python we have only two values true and false so they start with capital F and lowercase rest of the word true and false like that so those very two boolean values either true or false and if you have done any binary yarn over computers represent all data as zeros and ones and we have boolean logic and we can map this boolean logic to zeros and ones so true can be onefourth kameez zero and we can do lots of logic with this so boolean values are used a lot in programming as we'll come across such as in loops can also set variables to be boolean values as we can have any bit of data because a something like is password correct and initially this is going to be false until the person has put it in then later on to put an A in a correct password you can change that variable to be true it's good we have keeping track of various things in your code because these brilliant values are representing 1 & 0 if you do something like true Plus force you get 1 because true is representing 1 and force is representing 0 so 1 plus 0 is 1 so they are kind of like variables in for we are representing a value but unlike variables you can't change true to be 0 and force to be 1 they are set how they are so in a way they are sort of like constants but first getting into slightly shaky territory I want to show you another useful thing regarding variables so from settings error variable to year he calls let's say 2000 obsessing an integer to the variable year and now I can do some a year equals year plus 20 to add to that value and also save that new value which is now 20 20 under the name year if I did something like year across 20 that's great but it's not saving the new value under the name year okay so if I type in here you'll see it's 2020 not 2040 because this 2040 was coming outside of that assignment so we can use something called an Augmented assignment operator to shorten this process here we have something like year plus 20 is a bit repetitive instead I can use something like year plus equals 20 and this will combine it so it's sort of adding and saving for new value so this should be sort pierced when 20 which should now be 20 40 because I've added 22 year which was 2020 and Batna Valley 2040 has been saved under the variable name you can use similar augmented assignments with the other or fitted operations so if it went equals 20 could do x equals 20 and missile year is now 40 thousand 400 it is shortens the process a little bit just to say one final thing about floats in particular what it's typed more generally are all about categorizing data so some data is text some data is numbers some numbers are whole numbers and if this also determines how the data is stored in the computer and all data is stored in binary but is stored in different ways and floats in particular I can be quite awkward something like an 0.5 plus one point two gives us one point seven which is fine but if I do something like naught point one plus not point to I should get nine point three and I sort of do I get naught point free and a bunch of zeroes and therefore and I'm Intimus because if you play around find this it seems completely bizarre the reason is because because we are trying to represent this decimal number as binary we have to do the computer has to store it as binary and unfortunately there is not just inherent to how the negative powers of two correspond to the negative powers of 10 there isn't always a way to completely represent the number exactly so the computer needs to approximate nor point free in binary and so we get often a slight residue left over usually a very very small number but it looks very word and why you would fix this is by rounding for exactly it round and boom one plus in Auckland and then add a second parameter here of two places two digits and I give it an open free we'll talk more about functions like this in future videos but we have this left over and this is not a huge deal once you understand what's going on and you are careful around it there have been some instances where programmers haven't really understood what's going on and so there's been major issues but we are used to approximations in decimal to thinking in an an open for itself if it's a third we can represent the third as a fraction but we need to cut off an Allpoint free free free free free at some point by use two approximations it's a similar sort of idea here I as always I recommend you pause the video now and try these exercises the first two are just about first of all reading freebies lines of code so we've got one line second line third line four find they're running like that try and think about with a final value of these variables will be so trace it through and see where the assignments are changing and then try it yourself to see if you were correct and four in four have a look at these two lines and see if you can figure out what the errors are and why the errors would occur
