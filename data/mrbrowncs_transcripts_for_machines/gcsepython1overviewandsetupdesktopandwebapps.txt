hello and welcome to first in a series of videos which cover various features of the Python programming language now roads are really good resources online and more specifically on YouTube which cover Python I'm definitely not the first to approach this and you can learn Python so many different ways just using videos may not suit everyone but this series is designed especially for people studying computer science in UK schools including those doing qualifications like GCC's and alevels because python is well and doesn't belong to anyone in exam board the videos will be quite generic I'm not going to be tying from 20 particular exam board but I'll be emphasizing as we go through various concepts which are particularly relevant in UK curricula and likewise leaving out various constructs which aren't going to be required for most exams or assessments if you are wanting to learn or revise programming for a specific qualification especially if you have a written exam coming up have a look at other playlists on my channel where there will be videos which cover the more faretta core programming concepts although many will be showing practically here for now though I just want to give a brief overview of Python itself and show you how to get set up with Python both installing it on your computer and also accessing online and then get you to write your first line of code as well okay so really quickly what is Python so python is what we would consider a highlevel and a very versatile programming language a programming language means we're using it to interact with a computer and get a computer to do what we instruct it to essentially which is very exciting it's high level so high level is a concept or the levels of programming languages is a concept in computer science so a high level language does not mean that it's like especially difficult that's what I perceived high level to me when I was learning my level means 4 there is a lot more readable it's a lot closer to English language than say the computers language which is in binary so you could program a computer in just binary because that's ultimately what a computer understands that's gonna be very difficult and so doing in a high level way means we can do it in pretty much human language just following a very strict the rules and so the high level languages is a massive category but even among them compared to other programming languages you might want to learn Python is especially high level which is really good for beginners because it looks especially like normal written English even if a slightly weird version so the top here this top line is from C or C++ and this bottom line is from Python or dubis Python code a bit later printing hello world they're the same code they do the same thing both outputting hello world to the screen you can see immediately in C it's a little bit strange looking you've got some more elements to it or a semicolon Python is a little bit cleaner and it's a little bit more readable and it's one of the reasons why it's very versatile it can be used in lots different contexts so can see to be fair but python is often used as sort of a glue between various different purposes YouTube for a while use Python to work using lots of different applications you can do pretty much what you want to of Python maybe not for core aspects of Python but you can use what we call libraries to expand what Python can do and linked to various different applications it's also versatile because within Python you can effectively choose what style you want to follow we call them paradigms in computing so different paradigms for programming languages allow you to code in different ways and Python supports the main programming paradigms like functional programming like objectoriented programming and like structured programming which is what we're going to start with according to the later study I found Python is Karin Eva third most popular programming language in the world behind C is number two which is the code up here and number one is Java which you may have heard of both of those to a slightly lower level than Python although still considered high level languages but Python is really really popular especially celina if you ever go to university to do computer science it's very likely you will learn to see java and python good languages to use I personally like Python first and then that Java and C afterwards Python is a good springboard but partners use a lot and it's like hypothesis on my behalf but I would suggest for every big technology company we use Python code somewhere in their company even if it's not creating their main they'll be using Python code somewhere maybe it's running a website maybe it's linking a database maybe it's running some artificial intelligence algorithm python is used a lot but also as we go through these videos it may not be immediately clear how on earth what you're learning would ever be applied I certainly remember learning Python or thinking this is all fine but how is risk I'd ever be used and it it becomes a lot more linked to rule life problems once you start to use for as libraries I mentioned which tie your code to a particular purpose when we're learning for general constructs which are required to leave a more interesting stuff is can seem very detached from real life problems we need to learn for basics before we can do the more advanced stuff perfect itself has been around for a while released back in 1981 by a man called guido van rossum a dutch programmer there are some good interviews of him on YouTube if you're interested and the name itself doesn't actually come from a snake even if the logo apparently is meant to be of two snakes blue snake and the yellow snake I didn't realize that for years her name comes from Monty Python which was or suppose is was a British comedy group back in the 70s in particular pretty famous and he was obviously inspired by them and named the language after them but you I mention this mostly because there are quite a few references to Monty Python has Erlang and it'd be very confusing if you didn't know why they have those references even if you don't get four references yourself there'll be one later involving this man on the right Eric Idle in terms of getting set up so we can start doing some coding a code is just an instruction to a computer a computer can't understand or code on its own because it's high level it's too high for a computer to understand we have to bring back down to a computer can understand which is binary thankfully we don't do both translation is done by a program called an interpreter but winged to have access TV interpreter to be able to run to be able to carry out Python code so there are too many ways of doing this both of which I'll show you briefly in a second the first way is downloading into your desktop which is good if you want to keep it offline and save your files and organize it that way but was also you can access it online via a web app okay I'll show you an example of that later as well perhaps visas worth getting is just by googling install Python and you're looking for the downloads page of python.org who run the Python and so at the top I'm I think it may also detect your OS your operating systems or Windows or Mac or Linux if it doesn't you click for one which you are so I'm Windows so I wanna download the latest version there are previous versions down here I would stick to the latest one there's no reason not to really click download if you are prompted to save it and work for its downloading Chrome it's down at the bottom and now you can click it so it is at least a Windows ad or executable file Exe file and so you just click it now run and you can pretty much leave all the defaults how they are there's no particular reason why you wouldn't want to so you can install now for maybe a administrator request just sign in or press yes event or install like that okay and now once it's done it took me about a minute and a half to install and close it down once you have Python installed and you've closed Installer you now can search for idle or IDL e this is the name of the IDE the integrated development environment which we can write Python code in is called idle not IDE because one of the members of Monty Python is called Eric Idle so it's another reference to Monty Python but it is an integrated development environment so I've got the two minnows up here but this window pops up when you open idle is called for Python shell also called the interactive shell this is where we can type code line by line it's really good for testing things out and so the first few videos will be just in the shell and the first few to type in when you do any programming is always get the computer to say hello world so if you copy this bit of code print bracket quotes hello world close quote close bracket and then press Enter so for return key or Enter key on your keyboard you'll get four computer to speak to you so hello world is the output from the input up here this line of code for computer is running is processing is carrying out this instruction to print hello world as printing it to us and printing being another word for out putting it on the screen you can't really make a proper program in interactive mode effect you can't you can't save it or anything like that it's just for testing really and also running programs instead in Python need to go to script mode so script mode you access but that's a file a new file like that and a new window pops up and you can type the equivalent here the same code prints hello world like that and now this time instead of pressing enter pressing enter will just go down because it's where we'd write a proper long program so instead to run this code we go to run at the top and go to a run module or press f5 you've got to save your code this time which is good because we can keep it you press ok and choose a place on your computer to save it files are called something dot py so I can just do I've done loads at once here example and press ENTER like that and it goes back to the shell because that's where the code is run so instead of having it as your code in the shell it just shows us the output in the show let me do that instead of actually downloading python and installing it on your computer on the desktop you can access it online via a web application an example is replic repl die T and this is free our time recording even if it does have a paid version as well so I'm going through my first few videos at least be using this it has the same features as idle in fact some more useful features as well which I'll show you in a second so once you go to our EPO to IT in your browser you can either to start coding straight to ever clicking this I mean going to like this and then you will create a repple which is very sort of equipment of opening idle and here you can just get started very quickly it will give you here we've got on the one side is what the equivalent of your idle show is somewhere on side we've got the interactive shell we can type here so again if you haven't done in idle make sure at some point you type print hello world it's convention millions of programmers have done it before presenter and it runs it like the idle shell word on the left hand side is reckless equivalent of script mode so instead I can now here type in again hello world so was it struggle to type it when you try to talk so I've got my code ear and now as opposed to saving it thankfully it saves it for us which is quite nice I can hit run here and it runs it in my interactive shell over here like it did in idle so very very similar but this is good because you can do it without installing anything and I'd really recommend you sign up as well so you can sign up here again I can set up a time recording it's free at least initially and say you put username your email and a password sign up once you are signed in and have a new workspace what's good about doing online is you can share your code quite easily so there's a share button over here to click this you can share a link to your work space so if you have code which you want to show up say a teacher or a friend you just put the link into browser or show them the code you can also just share the output if you want to over here so it's quite good at sharing codes and also it can save that and keep it for you without having to manage on your computer so opposed to now I prefer to offline but doing online is really good especially once you're starting up feel free to use return tip software to idle or repla if you want to unfortunately kind of learn a programming language just by sitting watching a video it's really important you actually try for stuff yourself so the end of every video I'm going to include a try now which is exercise on multiple exercises which will hopefully reinforce for content of a video for this video is very simple just have access to Python setup somehow either desktop or online and make sure you have copied this code print hello world and I can see hello world coming back on your screen
