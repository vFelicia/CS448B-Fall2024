hey in this fifth video I want to talk about printing and how it can output stuff to the user I would also talk about comments and casting as we go I would also like to start transitioning away from the interactive mode which is really really useful for us playing around and getting used to things and we'll still use it at some point but I want us to use a script mode because we want to be writing the proper programs which we can download and run so I'm going to keep using red blitz but you can also do mr. Michaux so in repla on the left hand side this is our script mode and Envoy right hand side is our interactive shell we can still use the interactive shell but now we can start to write code on script mode in script mode and run it and it will show the output over here so really the interactive show now is where the output is shown you can imagine the user running your program on their computer this would this show is what shows what they would see let's start with outputting data because we've done that already in our first video where we typed in prints hello world like that and we did it in the interactive show so we didn't see these colors for colors often come from you Wafaa come from the IDE so in this case is a repla online IDE but alternatively we could do it in idle which is awesome colors for colors are different so here let's just do hello here prints goes to purple in repla goes to blue that color scheme is just a down to you for creators or the IDs the color schemes is the help us it doesn't help for computer there being different colors it's a way for us to distinguish between different constructs in Python so this color here blue in repla this refers to a built in function and we'll see many more of these as we go so in script mode I've written my print hello world I've done some blank lines here Beth fine nothing's contained on them I now can hit run up here and run the code before I was just pressing enter and it would do it for us perhaps be interactive show it works differently to script mode and we get hello world to you notice a bit slower sometimes on replica least to run this that's why the interactive shell can be sometimes better but for longer programs it doesn't it's different so we've got hello world same idea in pipe in idle except to get to your script mode we can go to file new file and this window pops up just my other screen is where we would write our code instead and if you want to replicate the same sort of look as on replicant have it side by side we could just drag it across and have a split screen like that same idea here so I've typed in my code on the left hand side of the strip mode but now you've got to make sure you go to run and run module and then it last you to save it you save your file and then it will run in the shell so it's a bit more of a faff honestly doing it in idle but very advantageous to do it offline as well one of the advantages of doing it in I do is you've got that file saved on your computer if you want to get the file which is stored on rep let you go over here and download a zip all of your files will be on the left hand side in this report they call it you download it as a zip extract it and your file will be there and if you want to give it to someone else fastest one where you can do it anyway so printing so what printing does at its core is take whatever is inside these brackets and output it to V user and put it in the form of text on the user's screen so this hello world here was actually output it not by python but by whatever program repla is write whatever language repla is running on the equivalent of a print statement of that language was used to show hello world on the screen all the stuff here was shown to us as users with some equivalent of a print statement except for most programs we are used to are what we call graphical user interfaces you'll notice how in the initial learning of Python we're just going to use commandline interfaces which are quite different to what we are used to which is where we have in a shell just output lines or input into Mempa and it will react like that so programs we're making at the start a very different a programs we're used to the Python can be used to make the fancy graphical programs once you know the basics so carne inside about hello world we've got a string we can also print say an integer is 5 a whole number can also print say 5 5 point 5 that you notice when I'm typing stuff in at least in wrap blur not so much in idle or idle does it occasionally a box pops up this is trying to help us by giving more details about Python which is which can be got useful it's showing us here what else we can put it inside shrink a print function beyond just a value which is useful you can ignore for time beings click away and now we can run this and it will do the same thing can see each print statement is doing it on a separate line if you particularly want to get rid of this you can instead add a comma after your first value you are trying to print and as it says actually in this helpful prompt if we type end like this go equals we can supply what we call a parameter to end is a variable which is submitted to this function and we can stay instead of the default type in say an empty string like that we'll have a space and now if I run it you'll notice for hello world it's followed by five because for hello world print statement is not ending on a new line it's ending on just a space and so there's a space between the hello world and the five say we have some shopping application I want to output the price you could do something like an output saying I don't know for price is five pounds or even we can have a price is some variable called price which a variable would be replaced at one time maybe with an input so what I've done here I've done a hash symbol what you see a hash tag and say Twitter this is what we call a comment so a comment is really good because a comment is where we can kind of type anything we want to but without actually turning up in our actual programs if I run this now nothing will appear here because a comment is completely ignored by the computer so a comment is good if you're wanting to write a message if you yourself will to someone else they're also really important to explain what your code is doing because often code can be a bit complex and if you're sharing it if someone else a comment it can help make sense so anyway let's say we're trying to get this output the price is whatever this price the variable is let's save as price variable for time being is just five pounds maybe so in step five and if we want to print this out we could do print five or could use read print price because five is assigned to price and so when I do print price it replaces price for five which is what's been saved and so we'll just get five fair this isn't matching what we have here so instead you can do something like we could do the price is pound because all of that is a string this up here is not an integer it's a different days to have you put us around it in quotes the price is not a string it's an integer and so we can use for comic gain in the print statement to separate out two values so if I run this now we will get to a price is pound sign space five so almost what I wanted up here using print statements with commas on is really good if you have different datatypes you're wanting to combine somehow because if we did something like the price is pound and then after that quote we did a plus and the price this will not work because five is an integer and we're trying to add an integer to a string which it doesn't like we can fix this by doing something called casting casting from an integer back to a string by surrounding this price with an SDR function so like a print this is built into Python is done to help us so to make sure you have enough brackets because really we are evaluating this first and then including it in our prints Damon and now this will work the advantage if we are getting rid of this space after pound sign because by default for where it was naturally is when you have a comma it replaces vac comma with the separator and by default we're separator is a space if you really wanted to get rid of this like with the end extra parameter you type in set and set this to be an empty string and it gets rid of a separator working as a space a space as a character we just don't see it onscreen so generally casting it's converting data types and we do this by using a shorthand version of datatype so we can do for example int as to us as a comic again could do for example int is 5 as a character this will convert int this will convert for string version of 5 into vintage a version of 5 so we can use it in calculation so that's going to use 4 then a second when we do inputs of a viceversa we can do STR and convert 5 back to that character now before we look at inputting pause this video and have a look at these questions and I recommend you try some of this code out yourself and have a little play around
