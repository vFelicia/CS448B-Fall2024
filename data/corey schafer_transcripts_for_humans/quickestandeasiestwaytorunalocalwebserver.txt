00:00 - hey how's it going everybody in this
00:02 - video we're gonna take a look at how to
00:04 - quickly and easily spin up a local web
00:06 - server so if you're working on a website
00:08 - and you want to open that up in the
00:09 - browser sometimes it can be a pain to
00:11 - download programs like map or to do an
00:15 - entire set up of Apache or something
00:17 - like that it's kind of overkill if you
00:18 - just want to quickly glance at it
00:20 - I think the quickest and easiest way to
00:22 - do this is with pythons built in simple
00:25 - HTTP server now you will have to have
00:27 - Python installed but if you're on a Mac
00:29 - then that's gonna already be installed
00:31 - for you so let's take a look at how to
00:33 - do this first of all you want to open up
00:34 - your terminal so I have two terminal
00:36 - windows open up here and then you want
00:37 - to navigate to where your website is so
00:40 - for example I have a website here in the
00:42 - site's directory and then demos and then
00:46 - test site and if I look at the contents
00:49 - of this folder then the file that I want
00:51 - to take a look at is actually in this
00:52 - disk folder here so I'm going to CD into
00:54 - that directory and now if I do an LS in
00:58 - that folder then you can see here where
01:00 - we have the index.html file now to spin
01:03 - up a quick local web server and to view
01:05 - this file in the browser all you have to
01:07 - do is type in Python - M simple HTTP
01:13 - server and then you want to type in by
01:16 - default it's going to be port 8000 but I
01:19 - always type it in just to be sure so you
01:21 - type in the port number there so hit
01:23 - enter and you can see here in this
01:24 - terminal window it says serving HTTP on
01:27 - port 8000 so now if I go over here into
01:30 - my browser and type in localhost and
01:32 - then go to port 8000 and hit enter now
01:35 - you can see it opens up that test
01:37 - website within the browser so our local
01:39 - web server is running if you come over
01:41 - here into the terminal then you can see
01:43 - that it actually gives you some
01:44 - information - about what the web server
01:46 - is doing so you can see here that a get
01:48 - request on the route gave a 200 response
01:51 - and then you can see where it goes and
01:53 - requests the different CSS files and
01:56 - JavaScript files and things like that
01:57 - now you can minimize this terminal
02:00 - window here but be sure to keep it open
02:02 - because that is what's running your
02:04 - webserver so you don't want to close
02:05 - that down or else it'll close the web
02:07 - server down now the thing I like about
02:09 - this method is that it's so easy to spin
02:12 - up another server on
02:13 - and listen on another port so for
02:16 - example if I go to this other demo that
02:19 - I have called sample map if I CD into
02:22 - that directory and then LS you can see I
02:25 - have my index.html file here and so this
02:28 - other web server is still running here
02:30 - in the background so I could do Python -
02:33 - M HTTP HTTP server and I can do this on
02:38 - whatever port I want I'll just pick a
02:40 - random port at44 hit enter there so now
02:43 - you can see that it's serving on port 80
02:45 - 44 so if I go up here and go to
02:48 - localhost port 80 44 hit enter and now
02:51 - that website has is now running in the
02:55 - browser on that local web server
02:56 - listening on that port and now if you
02:59 - want to close down these web servers all
03:02 - you got to do is either close out of the
03:03 - terminal window or within the terminal
03:05 - window you can also hit control C you
03:08 - can see that it'll send a keyboard
03:10 - interrupt there and now if I try to
03:12 - reload that page then that server is no
03:15 - longer running and if I do it up here as
03:18 - well and try to reload this page and you
03:21 - can see that it's no longer listening on
03:23 - that port so you can see how a method
03:25 - like this is a lot faster than
03:27 - downloading a program like map or trying
03:30 - to set up a patchy or something like
03:31 - that just to quickly look at your
03:33 - website within the browser so that about
03:35 - does it for this video hopefully you
03:37 - guys found this quick tip useful
