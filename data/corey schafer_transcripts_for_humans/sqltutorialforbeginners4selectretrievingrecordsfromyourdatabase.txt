00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video we will be learning how to
00:03 - retrieve data from our database using
00:06 - the select statement now in order to
00:08 - have more data to work with than we had
00:10 - in our previous videos I created a table
00:13 - here called people that has 20 sample
00:17 - random records so this table has this ID
00:20 - column first name last name age and
00:24 - occupation so let's go ahead and get
00:25 - started and see how we can retrieve
00:28 - values from this table using the select
00:30 - statement so first let's just grab all
00:33 - of our records from the table now we can
00:36 - do this with the query select star
00:41 - from people now what's going on here is
00:43 - we're doing select and then we want to
00:47 - specify which columns that we want and
00:49 - if we put a star in then we're just
00:51 - saying that we want everything so we're
00:53 - saying select everything and then we
00:56 - need to tell it where we want everything
00:58 - from and we want it from the table
01:00 - people so if I run this query you can
01:04 - see that we get back all 20 records from
01:07 - our people table so what if instead of
01:09 - all the columns we just wanted the first
01:11 - name and the last name well instead of
01:14 - this star to get all of the columns we
01:16 - can just do first name and then comma
01:20 - last name and if we run this query you
01:23 - can see that now we get all 20 records
01:26 - but we only get the first name and the
01:28 - last name columns so this is great so
01:31 - far but how do we actually filter the
01:33 - results down to records that meet a
01:36 - certain criteria um so we can do this
01:39 - with the wear Clause so let's say I want
01:42 - to retrieve all the records from the
01:44 - people table where the last name is
01:47 - equal to do well to do that I can just
01:50 - add in this wear Clause here then I can
01:52 - say where last name is equal to and then
01:56 - within quotes here do so now if I go
01:59 - ahead and run this then you can see that
02:02 - we got all of the records back where the
02:04 - last name is equal to do now we do need
02:07 - these quotes around uh the last name
02:09 - here because the last name column
02:11 - contains string characters now what if
02:13 - we wanted to retrieve all the records
02:15 - from our database where the last name
02:18 - was either equal to doe or Smith well we
02:21 - can do this by adding an or to our wear
02:25 - Clause so here where we have last name
02:28 - equal to do and on the next line I can
02:31 - add in or last name equal to Smith so if
02:37 - I run this now you can see that we get
02:40 - all of the results back where the last
02:41 - name is equal to do or the last name is
02:44 - equal to Smith so now looking over here
02:46 - in the age column what if I wanted all
02:48 - the records in our table where the last
02:51 - name was equal to do and the age was
02:54 - less than 30 uh so we can do this by
02:58 - adding an and to our w Clause so instead
03:00 - of this or here I'm going to do an and
03:04 - age less than 30 so if we run this we
03:09 - can see that now we only get two results
03:11 - back instead of three and all of the
03:14 - ages are less than 30 so let's quickly
03:16 - look at the difference between the and
03:18 - statement and the or statement so the
03:20 - and requires that both conditions are
03:23 - met so in this example the last name and
03:26 - the age conditions are both met uh if I
03:29 - was to replace this here with an or and
03:33 - ran this query you can see that now it
03:35 - returns all of the records where either
03:37 - of these conditions are met so now
03:39 - instead of returning all of the records
03:41 - where the last name is equal to do and
03:44 - they're less than the age of 30 it's
03:47 - returning all of the records where the
03:49 - last name is equal to do or the age is
03:52 - less than 30 so you can see here that we
03:54 - have a last name with Smith where the
03:56 - age is less than 30 and it got included
03:58 - because we using the or statement so now
04:01 - let's take a look at how we can sort the
04:03 - results that we get back from our table
04:06 - so we can do this by using the order by
04:09 - statement so here I'm going to write a
04:11 - query that retrieves all of the records
04:14 - from our table where the age is less
04:17 - than 34 so if I run this you can see
04:21 - that we got four results back so now
04:24 - let's say that we want to order these
04:26 - results by the age you can see here that
04:29 - right now the age is out of order so if
04:32 - I go down here a line and type in order
04:35 - by now I can specify which column I want
04:38 - to order by so I'll type in age here and
04:41 - now if I run this query you can see that
04:43 - now the results have been sorted by the
04:46 - youngest to the oldest okay so that's
04:49 - good but what if I wanted to order by
04:51 - the oldest to the youngest well we can
04:54 - do this just by adding in this
04:57 - DC to the end of our our query and this
05:01 - stands for order by descending so if I
05:04 - run this now then now you can see that
05:06 - instead of ordering from the lowest
05:08 - number to the highest number now it's
05:10 - ordering from the highest number to the
05:12 - lowest number now order by ascending is
05:14 - the default but if you want to
05:16 - explicitly tell it ascending order then
05:18 - you can type in ASC here for ascending
05:21 - order now if I run this you can see that
05:23 - we got back the results that we did when
05:25 - we did the order by age so it's from the
05:27 - youngest to the oldest now we can also
05:29 - order on multiple columns so let's say
05:32 - that we wanted to order these results by
05:35 - their names so here I can just replace
05:38 - this with order by first name and now if
05:42 - I run this you can see that it did order
05:45 - everything by the first name but down
05:47 - here where we have John Smith and John
05:50 - Doe you can see that our John Smith
05:52 - record comes before John Doe but what if
05:56 - we wanted this to order by the entire
05:58 - name so so what we can do here is we can
06:01 - add the last name onto the end of our
06:04 - order by statement as well so I can put
06:06 - in a comma here and type in last name
06:09 - and now if I run this query now this is
06:12 - going to order all of our results first
06:15 - by the first name and then second by the
06:19 - last name so you can see here that the
06:21 - order of these two names is now uh in
06:24 - the order that we wanted we have John do
06:25 - before John Smith so that about does it
06:28 - for this video and this video we went
06:30 - over how to retrieve values from your
06:33 - database and also how we can specify
06:36 - certain columns and also filter the
06:38 - results down using the wear Clause we
06:41 - also looked at how what the differences
06:43 - were between the and and the or when
06:46 - used with the wear claw and we also
06:48 - learned how to order and sort some of
06:50 - our results so hopefully this video was
06:52 - useful for you all if you do have any
06:54 - questions just ask in the comment
06:56 - section below uh be sure to subscribe
06:58 - for future videos I think in the next
07:00 - video we'll take a look at how to update
07:02 - records in our database so be sure to

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody how's it going in this video we will be learning how to retrieve data from our database using the select statement now in order to have more data to work with than we had in our previous videos I created a table here called people that has 20 sample random records so this table has this ID column first name last name age and occupation so let's go ahead and get started and see how we can retrieve values from this table using the select statement so first let's just grab all of our records from the table now we can do this with the query select star from people now what's going on here is we're doing select and then we want to specify which columns that we want and if we put a star in then we're just saying that we want everything so we're saying select everything and then we need to tell it where we want everything from and we want it from the table people so if I run this query you can see that we get back all 20 records from our people table so what if instead of all the columns we just wanted the first name and the last name well instead of this star to get all of the columns we can just do first name and then comma last name and if we run this query you can see that now we get all 20 records but we only get the first name and the last name columns so this is great so far but how do we actually filter the results down to records that meet a certain criteria um so we can do this with the wear Clause so let's say I want to retrieve all the records from the people table where the last name is equal to do well to do that I can just add in this wear Clause here then I can say where last name is equal to and then within quotes here do so now if I go ahead and run this then you can see that we got all of the records back where the last name is equal to do now we do need these quotes around uh the last name here because the last name column contains string characters now what if we wanted to retrieve all the records from our database where the last name was either equal to doe or Smith well we can do this by adding an or to our wear Clause so here where we have last name equal to do and on the next line I can add in or last name equal to Smith so if I run this now you can see that we get all of the results back where the last name is equal to do or the last name is equal to Smith so now looking over here in the age column what if I wanted all the records in our table where the last name was equal to do and the age was less than 30 uh so we can do this by adding an and to our w Clause so instead of this or here I'm going to do an and age less than 30 so if we run this we can see that now we only get two results back instead of three and all of the ages are less than 30 so let's quickly look at the difference between the and statement and the or statement so the and requires that both conditions are met so in this example the last name and the age conditions are both met uh if I was to replace this here with an or and ran this query you can see that now it returns all of the records where either of these conditions are met so now instead of returning all of the records where the last name is equal to do and they're less than the age of 30 it's returning all of the records where the last name is equal to do or the age is less than 30 so you can see here that we have a last name with Smith where the age is less than 30 and it got included because we using the or statement so now let's take a look at how we can sort the results that we get back from our table so we can do this by using the order by statement so here I'm going to write a query that retrieves all of the records from our table where the age is less than 34 so if I run this you can see that we got four results back so now let's say that we want to order these results by the age you can see here that right now the age is out of order so if I go down here a line and type in order by now I can specify which column I want to order by so I'll type in age here and now if I run this query you can see that now the results have been sorted by the youngest to the oldest okay so that's good but what if I wanted to order by the oldest to the youngest well we can do this just by adding in this DC to the end of our our query and this stands for order by descending so if I run this now then now you can see that instead of ordering from the lowest number to the highest number now it's ordering from the highest number to the lowest number now order by ascending is the default but if you want to explicitly tell it ascending order then you can type in ASC here for ascending order now if I run this you can see that we got back the results that we did when we did the order by age so it's from the youngest to the oldest now we can also order on multiple columns so let's say that we wanted to order these results by their names so here I can just replace this with order by first name and now if I run this you can see that it did order everything by the first name but down here where we have John Smith and John Doe you can see that our John Smith record comes before John Doe but what if we wanted this to order by the entire name so so what we can do here is we can add the last name onto the end of our order by statement as well so I can put in a comma here and type in last name and now if I run this query now this is going to order all of our results first by the first name and then second by the last name so you can see here that the order of these two names is now uh in the order that we wanted we have John do before John Smith so that about does it for this video and this video we went over how to retrieve values from your database and also how we can specify certain columns and also filter the results down using the wear Clause we also looked at how what the differences were between the and and the or when used with the wear claw and we also learned how to order and sort some of our results so hopefully this video was useful

database so be sure to subscribe for those future videos and thank you all for watching
