With timestamps:

00:00 - hey everybody how's it going I wanted to
00:02 - make a video on setting up a development
00:06 - environment in sublime text to just walk
00:09 - through how to get it installed how to
00:12 - get set up with package control and
00:14 - package control it's going to allow you
00:15 - to install some third-party plugins also
00:18 - I will show you some packages that I use
00:21 - everyday and also will mess around with
00:24 - a little a few of the user settings to
00:27 - get you started so we're over here at
00:29 - the sublime text website and the first
00:31 - thing you want to do is just go ahead
00:33 - and download the program you can either
00:34 - click on this download link here or
00:36 - there should be a download button on the
00:39 - home page I already have this downloaded
00:41 - here so I'm just going to go ahead and
00:42 - install it and once this is installed if
00:49 - you're on a Mac and you can just drag
00:51 - this app into your Applications folder
00:52 - and let's go ahead and open that up okay
01:03 - now the first thing I'm going to do now
01:05 - that I have sublime text open as I'm
01:07 - going to drag in a test project that I
01:10 - have here just so that we can see see
01:13 - some files on the screen so I'll just
01:16 - drag that over and drop it and I'm going
01:19 - to open up my sample HTML file my sample
01:23 - CSS file and my sample javascript file
01:27 - okay
01:28 - and now that we have something to work
01:30 - with the first thing that we're going to
01:32 - want to install is packets control so to
01:35 - install package control just go back
01:38 - over here to google and type in sublime
01:44 - text package control and it should be
01:47 - the first link at the top and from here
01:50 - just go to install now and you're gonna
01:53 - have two options listed here you're
01:55 - going to have an option for sublime text
01:57 - 3 and you're gonna have an option for
01:59 - sublime text too since we're doing
02:00 - sublime text to go ahead and move over
02:03 - to that time and copy all this and
02:08 - within sublime text
02:11 - if we go to view and show console that
02:17 - will open up the console to where we
02:19 - need to paste this code in to install
02:21 - package control so just paste there hit
02:24 - enter and it says okay you're finished
02:27 - please restart sublime text to finish
02:29 - the installation so we will quit out of
02:32 - here and open it back up and to test the
02:40 - package control works let's hit command
02:42 - shift P if that if you're on a Mac ctrl
02:45 - shift P if you're on a if you're on
02:47 - Windows and then do install and install
02:51 - package okay and so if you can get to
02:55 - this point then it means package control
02:57 - is work and now we can install all the
02:58 - any of these third-party applications
03:01 - just for just just for our first one
03:04 - let's just do something easy and install
03:06 - color scheme some of the color schemes I
03:10 - like or this guy has a ton these Dale
03:13 - Reis color schemes go ahead and install
03:15 - that to minimize this here and you can
03:20 - see at the bottom left that says
03:21 - installing package color schemes and it
03:25 - shouldn't take long to finish up here
03:27 - but okay so package color scheme
03:29 - successfully install it perfect okay now
03:33 - to change your color scheme you can
03:36 - click on sublime text here and go to
03:38 - your preferences and in color scheme now
03:42 - we should have that plug-in that we just
03:45 - installed and it'll give us you know you
03:47 - have a ton of different color schemes to
03:50 - choose from here so you can just pick
03:51 - any one of these and it changes there's
03:55 - let me make this text a little bit
03:56 - bigger for you guys changes the color of
04:02 - your text but you can also install
04:05 - entire themes and wanting to what a
04:07 - theme is is it will change the entire
04:11 - layout of the application and make it
04:14 - look like an entire different
04:16 - application really so it'll change the
04:18 - style of the tabs it'll change the style
04:20 - of the folders so to do that let's go
04:23 - ahead and install one of those
04:24 - command shift P again and install and a
04:29 - theme that's really popular is one
04:30 - called pre-dawn and if you click up here
04:33 - on pre-dawn it will install and it pops
04:37 - up with a readme sometimes whenever you
04:40 - sometimes whenever you install these
04:43 - packages it automatically comes up with
04:45 - a readme file and a lot of these are
04:47 - really useful so I suggest you read
04:48 - through them whenever you whenever they
04:50 - pop up so right here it says to activate
04:56 - the theme add or replace your current
04:58 - theme settings with the code below so
05:01 - all we need to do is copy this and then
05:07 - we want to open up our settings so we go
05:10 - to sublime text to preferences and we
05:14 - want to open up our user settings the
05:17 - default settings I'll go ahead and open
05:19 - this up so you can see the default
05:21 - settings have all the settings for
05:23 - sublime text there's a ton of them in
05:25 - here but if you change this file then
05:29 - whenever sublime text updates then it's
05:32 - gonna but it's gonna write over all your
05:34 - changes so you don't want to put you
05:37 - don't want to make any of your
05:39 - customizations to the settings in the
05:42 - default settings file you want to do all
05:44 - that in the user settings and it won't
05:47 - overwrite those it'll keep them so let's
05:49 - open up our user settings and we can go
05:52 - ahead and close down the default and as
05:57 - you can see here a few of these have
05:58 - already been changed this changed our
06:00 - color scheme and I change the font size
06:02 - so let's just go ahead and highlight all
06:05 - that and paste it in and save it and
06:12 - you'll see when we save it it changes
06:14 - the entire look of the application so
06:16 - the tabs look different our folders look
06:19 - different and if we go back to that
06:21 - readme file he also says he has some
06:28 - other settings that he likes as well and
06:30 - I happen to agree with them I like these
06:32 - settings also it just changes some of
06:35 - the default behavior
06:38 - the font size the font style so let's go
06:42 - ahead and copy that and let's put a
06:45 - comma there and paste that in and we're
06:50 - not gonna need this last comment down
06:52 - here and go ahead and save that and a
06:58 - few of the chain you can see the font
07:00 - change the font size changed and I'm
07:02 - gonna go ahead and restart this just
07:05 - because it recommended that we do that
07:08 - after we he says he are important make
07:11 - sure to restart sublime after installing
07:14 - and activating freed on okay so now we
07:16 - can close that stuff down now we have
07:19 - our HTML CSS and JavaScript files and so
07:23 - now we have a theme installed and you
07:26 - can switch between color schemes that
07:28 - stuff is all by preference if you guys
07:31 - want to use a different color scheme or
07:33 - use the default that's you know that
07:35 - that's up to you so now let's go ahead
07:38 - and install some packages that are
07:39 - actually going to help you with your
07:41 - development so if we hit command shift P
07:45 - install package let's install one called
07:52 - bracket highlighter and once again we
07:58 - are going to need to restart now what
08:04 - the bracket highlighter does it's a
08:06 - simple plugin all it does is tells you
08:09 - where your brackets are anytime so I'm
08:12 - in this javascript file and I'm inside
08:14 - this function it tells me over here by
08:16 - my line numbers okay this function
08:19 - starts here and it ends here and this
08:22 - works and it's not very useful for the
08:24 - example that I have up right now because
08:26 - it's only 32 lines of code but if you
08:28 - have you know functions that are
08:30 - hundreds of lines long then finding
08:33 - where those brackets begin and end is
08:35 - really useful it works in your
08:37 - JavaScript files and your CSS files it
08:39 - works here and even in your index files
08:41 - so see I click on head here and it tells
08:44 - me hey the head tag starts here and the
08:46 - head tag ends here so that's really
08:49 - useful
08:50 - okay let's go ahead and move on and
08:53 - install another plug-in install package
08:58 - and this one is going to be called
09:03 - sublime code Intel now this one takes a
09:07 - second to install but what the sublime
09:10 - code Intel does is it kind of add some
09:12 - IDE style functionality to your to the
09:15 - program so that'll it'll try to auto
09:18 - complete some code as you're typing it
09:21 - so for example here I'll just go and
09:23 - type in let's see VAR test string equals
09:30 - hey whoops okay so that completed while
09:35 - I was typing and opened up the readme
09:37 - file automatically okay so once again
09:40 - here's the readme file for the sublime
09:43 - code Intel so I highly recommend you
09:45 - guys read through these anytime you
09:47 - install package it get some good tips
09:49 - this one has some really useful
09:50 - shortcuts okay but let's go ahead and
09:53 - close that down and I'll show you what
09:56 - it does so this test string hey a test
10:00 - and on our next line if we type in test
10:04 - string dot then it's just going to give
10:06 - us some it's gonna try to complete the
10:09 - code for so it's going to kind of give
10:10 - us some suggestions here so we can you
10:13 - know see everything that we can do with
10:14 - this string so you know that's useful it
10:18 - kind of kind of helps out alright and
10:23 - let's go ahead and keep moving on
10:24 - install another package and another
10:30 - package I like is called Emmitt and I
10:34 - could do an entire different tutorial on
10:37 - Emmitt so I'm not going to spend too
10:39 - much time on this since we're just
10:40 - setting up and getting your sublime text
10:43 - setup for a development but Emmitt is
10:46 - pretty much a way to scaffold out your
10:51 - HTML files very quickly there's also
10:54 - some good CSS tricks that are built into
10:58 - it also but just really quick here what
11:02 - what Emmitt does is
11:04 - it allows you to quickly type in let's
11:07 - say like div class name with a with
11:14 - another div inside of that with class of
11:17 - summary and we want eight of those then
11:21 - we can hit tab and it's going to go
11:23 - ahead and autocomplete all that for us
11:25 - so it's just a really quick way to type
11:28 - these things out and and get them to
11:30 - display on the screen I'm not going to
11:33 - go through everything that you can do
11:35 - with it but I highly should just reading
11:37 - up on it once once you get comfortable
11:39 - with it it really makes your development
11:42 - setup a lot faster okay and the last
11:46 - plugin I'm going to show you guys is
11:50 - install package is sublime linter okay
12:01 - and you can see here
12:03 - sublime will enter as a plug-in that
12:05 - supports LEM programs known as linter it
12:08 - will highlight lines of code that the
12:11 - Leonard deems to contain potential
12:13 - errors so it kind of helps you out it's
12:17 - that kind of shows you where you might
12:20 - be making mistakes in your code and also
12:22 - give you suggestions to best practices
12:24 - handles a lot of languages here so let's
12:27 - just go ahead and see what it does if I
12:28 - go back to my main J's file here and
12:31 - save it and let's see if we have so as
12:35 - you can see here on the number line it's
12:37 - given a suggestion here and it says if I
12:39 - click on the line at the bottom left is
12:42 - where the suggestion is it says hey test
12:44 - string is defined but never used so I
12:46 - have a variable here that I've defined
12:48 - and I'm not using that anywhere else in
12:49 - my program so you know that's a good
12:53 - that's a good suggestion it's just going
12:56 - to kind of pop those up for you now and
12:59 - then and tell you where you've made a
13:01 - mistake or where or it could just be a
13:05 - warning to maybe not something that'll
13:07 - break your program but something that
13:09 - you might want to look at so there's
13:11 - another one here if I just delete a
13:13 - semicolon and save it then you know same
13:17 - thing click on
13:17 - it says hey you're missing a semicolon
13:19 - here so it's a it's really nice to have
13:21 - while while you're developing just to
13:25 - have something watching in the
13:26 - background like that because everybody
13:28 - makes those makes dumb mistakes like
13:30 - that from time to time so hopefully you
13:35 - got this was used for you guys now you
13:37 - have a way to change your color schemes
13:40 - change your the way that the application
13:43 - is laid out you know now you have a way
13:48 - to install third-party plugins and also
13:50 - a few plugins to get you started so
13:53 - hopefully this tutorial was useful for
13:56 - you guys and thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody how's it going I wanted to make a video on setting up a development environment in sublime text to just walk through how to get it installed how to get set up with package control and package control it's going to allow you to install some thirdparty plugins also I will show you some packages that I use everyday and also will mess around with a little a few of the user settings to get you started so we're over here at the sublime text website and the first thing you want to do is just go ahead and download the program you can either click on this download link here or there should be a download button on the home page I already have this downloaded here so I'm just going to go ahead and install it and once this is installed if you're on a Mac and you can just drag this app into your Applications folder and let's go ahead and open that up okay now the first thing I'm going to do now that I have sublime text open as I'm going to drag in a test project that I have here just so that we can see see some files on the screen so I'll just drag that over and drop it and I'm going to open up my sample HTML file my sample CSS file and my sample javascript file okay and now that we have something to work with the first thing that we're going to want to install is packets control so to install package control just go back over here to google and type in sublime text package control and it should be the first link at the top and from here just go to install now and you're gonna have two options listed here you're going to have an option for sublime text 3 and you're gonna have an option for sublime text too since we're doing sublime text to go ahead and move over to that time and copy all this and within sublime text if we go to view and show console that will open up the console to where we need to paste this code in to install package control so just paste there hit enter and it says okay you're finished please restart sublime text to finish the installation so we will quit out of here and open it back up and to test the package control works let's hit command shift P if that if you're on a Mac ctrl shift P if you're on a if you're on Windows and then do install and install package okay and so if you can get to this point then it means package control is work and now we can install all the any of these thirdparty applications just for just just for our first one let's just do something easy and install color scheme some of the color schemes I like or this guy has a ton these Dale Reis color schemes go ahead and install that to minimize this here and you can see at the bottom left that says installing package color schemes and it shouldn't take long to finish up here but okay so package color scheme successfully install it perfect okay now to change your color scheme you can click on sublime text here and go to your preferences and in color scheme now we should have that plugin that we just installed and it'll give us you know you have a ton of different color schemes to choose from here so you can just pick any one of these and it changes there's let me make this text a little bit bigger for you guys changes the color of your text but you can also install entire themes and wanting to what a theme is is it will change the entire layout of the application and make it look like an entire different application really so it'll change the style of the tabs it'll change the style of the folders so to do that let's go ahead and install one of those command shift P again and install and a theme that's really popular is one called predawn and if you click up here on predawn it will install and it pops up with a readme sometimes whenever you sometimes whenever you install these packages it automatically comes up with a readme file and a lot of these are really useful so I suggest you read through them whenever you whenever they pop up so right here it says to activate the theme add or replace your current theme settings with the code below so all we need to do is copy this and then we want to open up our settings so we go to sublime text to preferences and we want to open up our user settings the default settings I'll go ahead and open this up so you can see the default settings have all the settings for sublime text there's a ton of them in here but if you change this file then whenever sublime text updates then it's gonna but it's gonna write over all your changes so you don't want to put you don't want to make any of your customizations to the settings in the default settings file you want to do all that in the user settings and it won't overwrite those it'll keep them so let's open up our user settings and we can go ahead and close down the default and as you can see here a few of these have already been changed this changed our color scheme and I change the font size so let's just go ahead and highlight all that and paste it in and save it and you'll see when we save it it changes the entire look of the application so the tabs look different our folders look different and if we go back to that readme file he also says he has some other settings that he likes as well and I happen to agree with them I like these settings also it just changes some of the default behavior the font size the font style so let's go ahead and copy that and let's put a comma there and paste that in and we're not gonna need this last comment down here and go ahead and save that and a few of the chain you can see the font change the font size changed and I'm gonna go ahead and restart this just because it recommended that we do that after we he says he are important make sure to restart sublime after installing and activating freed on okay so now we can close that stuff down now we have our HTML CSS and JavaScript files and so now we have a theme installed and you can switch between color schemes that stuff is all by preference if you guys want to use a different color scheme or use the default that's you know that that's up to you so now let's go ahead and install some packages that are actually going to help you with your development so if we hit command shift P install package let's install one called bracket highlighter and once again we are going to need to restart now what the bracket highlighter does it's a simple plugin all it does is tells you where your brackets are anytime so I'm in this javascript file and I'm inside this function it tells me over here by my line numbers okay this function starts here and it ends here and this works and it's not very useful for the example that I have up right now because it's only 32 lines of code but if you have you know functions that are hundreds of lines long then finding where those brackets begin and end is really useful it works in your JavaScript files and your CSS files it works here and even in your index files so see I click on head here and it tells me hey the head tag starts here and the head tag ends here so that's really useful okay let's go ahead and move on and install another plugin install package and this one is going to be called sublime code Intel now this one takes a second to install but what the sublime code Intel does is it kind of add some IDE style functionality to your to the program so that'll it'll try to auto complete some code as you're typing it so for example here I'll just go and type in let's see VAR test string equals hey whoops okay so that completed while I was typing and opened up the readme file automatically okay so once again here's the readme file for the sublime code Intel so I highly recommend you guys read through these anytime you install package it get some good tips this one has some really useful shortcuts okay but let's go ahead and close that down and I'll show you what it does so this test string hey a test and on our next line if we type in test string dot then it's just going to give us some it's gonna try to complete the code for so it's going to kind of give us some suggestions here so we can you know see everything that we can do with this string so you know that's useful it kind of kind of helps out alright and let's go ahead and keep moving on install another package and another package I like is called Emmitt and I could do an entire different tutorial on Emmitt so I'm not going to spend too much time on this since we're just setting up and getting your sublime text setup for a development but Emmitt is pretty much a way to scaffold out your HTML files very quickly there's also some good CSS tricks that are built into it also but just really quick here what what Emmitt does is it allows you to quickly type in let's say like div class name with a with another div inside of that with class of summary and we want eight of those then we can hit tab and it's going to go ahead and autocomplete all that for us so it's just a really quick way to type these things out and and get them to display on the screen I'm not going to go through everything that you can do with it but I highly should just reading up on it once once you get comfortable with it it really makes your development setup a lot faster okay and the last plugin I'm going to show you guys is install package is sublime linter okay and you can see here sublime will enter as a plugin that supports LEM programs known as linter it will highlight lines of code that the Leonard deems to contain potential errors so it kind of helps you out it's that kind of shows you where you might be making mistakes in your code and also give you suggestions

you've made a mistake or where or it could just be a warning to maybe not something that'll break your program but something that you might want to look at so there's another one here if I just delete a semicolon and save it then you know same thing click on it says hey you're missing a semicolon here so it's a it's really nice to have while while you're developing just to have something watching in the background like that because everybody makes those makes dumb mistakes like that from time to time so hopefully you got this was used for you guys now you have a way to change your color schemes change your the way that the application is laid out you know now you have a way to install thirdparty plugins and also a few plugins to get you started so hopefully this tutorial was useful for you guys and thanks for watching
