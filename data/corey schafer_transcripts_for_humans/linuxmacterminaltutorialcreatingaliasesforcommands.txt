00:00 - hey everybody I wanted to do a quick
00:02 - video on getting started with aliases in
00:06 - the terminal pretty much what an alias
00:08 - is is it's just a shortcut for running
00:11 - for running terminal commands one or
00:14 - more terminal commands if you find
00:16 - yourself typing in the same commands
00:19 - over and over and over then it's usually
00:21 - a good idea to make an alias for that
00:23 - and it's gonna save you a lot of typing
00:25 - and also lets you work a lot faster so
00:29 - I'm already over here in the terminal so
00:33 - to start out let's go ahead and do a
00:35 - simple and we'll just write an alias to
00:38 - change directory to the desktop so
00:40 - normally how we would do this is we
00:42 - would just type in CD and to our desktop
00:48 - okay so now let's make an alias for that
00:52 - so let's just go back to our home
00:54 - directory and let's type in sudo nano
00:59 - and we want to go into the file dot bash
01:04 - underscore profile okay and as you can
01:10 - see mine is currently blank so to write
01:14 - our first alias all you have to do is
01:15 - type in alias and then the name of our
01:19 - alias this is just the shortcut for the
01:22 - command I'm going to call this DT since
01:24 - we're since it's changing the directory
01:25 - to the desktop and then equal sign with
01:28 - no spaces or anything and then two
01:33 - single quotes and within the single
01:35 - quotes we're going to put our command
01:37 - so CD and do the desktop okay let's go
01:43 - ahead and save that
01:48 - okay and for this to take effect we're
01:51 - gonna have to restart the terminal okay
01:58 - and now we should just be able to type
01:59 - in DT and it should change directory to
02:02 - our desktop okay so that shortcuts not
02:05 - going to save us a whole lot of time
02:07 - because it's such a short command but a
02:09 - lot of these commands can be a lot
02:12 - longer than that
02:13 - for example the command to to show
02:16 - hidden files on your Mac so if you see
02:20 - here on my desktop there are two hidden
02:24 - files that aren't showing up right now
02:26 - so I'll go ahead and type in the command
02:28 - to show those that is defaults right
02:33 - comm dot Apple finder see Apple show all
02:42 - files yes and then in order for that to
02:46 - take effect you have to restart finder
02:48 - to do that you do kill-all finder okay
02:53 - and now on the desktop here you can see
02:55 - these two hidden files that now show up
02:59 - and then to reverse that and hide the
03:01 - files again we have to do that same
03:04 - command but instead of yes type in no
03:06 - and then you have to restart finder
03:10 - again and now you can see that the files
03:12 - are hidden so that that's a lot to
03:15 - remember and it's such a long command it
03:19 - would be nice just to make an alias for
03:21 - that so let's go ahead and go back to
03:24 - your home directory and let's go ahead
03:26 - and open up that bash profile file again
03:32 - and I'm just going to go ahead and get
03:36 - rid of our alias for the changing
03:40 - directory to the desktop and instead
03:43 - let's make an alias for the command we
03:46 - just did I'm going to call that show
03:49 - files equals and then two quotes and
03:54 - within the quotes let's do defaults
03:57 - right com
04:01 - dot finder app will show all files yes
04:07 - and now that's one command and then we
04:10 - also need to run the command to restart
04:13 - the finder so to end this command you
04:16 - put in a semicolon and now you're still
04:19 - within the quotes here and with the
04:21 - semicolon it's saying okay I'm going to
04:22 - run that command and now we're gonna
04:24 - type in the second one kill-all finder
04:29 - okay now let's go ahead and do one to
04:32 - hide those files all so let's copy that
04:39 - let's paste this in and then study yes
04:44 - let's do no and instead of show files
04:50 - let's call that Hogg files let's go
04:53 - ahead and save our changes and let's
04:58 - restart terminal for those to take
05:00 - effect and now I should just be able to
05:06 - type in show files and if you look here
05:09 - at the desktop I'll hit enter and those
05:12 - hidden files show up and if I come over
05:15 - here and type in hide files and know
05:18 - that now those files are hidden so you
05:21 - can see how that shortcut saved us on a
05:24 - lot of timing and then we don't have to
05:26 - remember those long commands and those
05:28 - multiple commands so let me show you one
05:30 - more example here I have let me open up
05:34 - sublime text and I've made two more
05:38 - commands for myself and let me go ahead
05:44 - and open back up the bash profile file
05:48 - dot bash underscore profile
05:56 - and let me go down to the bottom here
06:01 - okay now these last two aliases that I
06:04 - had typed out here so say before I did a
06:10 - video tutorial if I wanted to do a few
06:12 - things say I wanted to come up here and
06:13 - instead of my clock being digital say I
06:17 - wanted to switch it to analog and also I
06:20 - might want to clean out my recycle bin
06:24 - and empty my downloads folder and also I
06:29 - may want to hide the dock when it's out
06:32 - of sight like that so instead of going
06:36 - through and doing all that stuff every
06:38 - time I want to start doing a screencast
06:42 - I can just make these aliases for me
06:45 - that will go through and do all that for
06:48 - me so let me go ahead and copy this one
06:50 - and paste it in and I'll walk through
06:53 - what it does okay so I'm calling this
06:56 - shortcut this alias I'm calling it Tut
06:59 - mode for tutorial mode and then the
07:02 - commands here I'm doing and I went ahead
07:05 - and put all the commands on new lines so
07:08 - that it's easier to read so I'm doing
07:10 - defaults right compal dot doc auto hide
07:16 - boolean to true that hides the doc to
07:21 - where here if you look at the bottom of
07:23 - the screen it'll hide the dock like that
07:24 - so that so that I don't have to have
07:27 - that up then it this command here kills
07:32 - the doc and restarts it so that that
07:33 - takes effect then this command defaults
07:37 - right Compal menu extra clock is analog
07:42 - boolean is true that switches the clock
07:47 - up here to analog and then kill all
07:52 - system UI server restarts the menu bar
07:56 - up here and then these are just two
07:59 - regular terminal commands this command
08:02 - empties my trash can and this command
08:05 - empties my downloads folder
08:08 - so and let me go ahead and copy and
08:12 - paste this command in and now this one
08:20 - will set everything back to normal so
08:22 - this will unhide the dock restart it and
08:28 - set my clock to digital rather than
08:31 - analog and then I don't need to do
08:33 - anything with the trash and the
08:34 - Downloads folder because you know
08:36 - they've already been emptied anyway so
08:38 - let me go ahead and put something in my
08:41 - trash here so that we can make sure that
08:45 - all this works paste that there and let
08:48 - me just go ahead and put that in okay
08:53 - and then let me go ahead and save the
08:55 - bash profile then we need to let me go
09:03 - ahead and close down sublime text and
09:05 - I'll restart the terminal and now I
09:12 - should just be able to type in Tut mode
09:16 - here and if you look up here at the
09:18 - clock and the recycle bin the Downloads
09:21 - folder and the dock at the bottom it
09:24 - should go through all those okay so it
09:26 - set the clock to analog I scroll down
09:29 - here to my dock the Downloads folder is
09:32 - empty the trash can is empty and the
09:34 - dock hides whenever I move the mouse
09:37 - away from it and then if I do regular
09:42 - mode then it sets everything back to
09:44 - normal so you can see how that saves
09:46 - just a ton of time it makes it so much
09:48 - easier things you know don't have to go
09:52 - through and remember every single step I
09:54 - can just type that in and I know that it
09:57 - does everything that I wanted to do for
09:59 - me so it's really nice if you ever if
10:02 - you ever forget what you're what you
10:05 - named your aliases like instead of Tut
10:08 - mode maybe or reg mode maybe I would
10:10 - think it's regular mode or something if
10:12 - you ever forget what you named it then
10:15 - within your terminal here you can just
10:17 - type the word alias and it'll pop up all
10:21 - the aliases
10:22 - let me make this bigger here for you
10:25 - it'll come up with all the aliases that
10:27 - you've created so you can see here you
10:29 - have alias hide files and this is the
10:32 - command reg mode show files and the Tut
10:39 - mode you know you can explore more with
10:40 - these you can even do functions within
10:43 - that file so that you can open up
10:46 - programs with with specific variables
10:48 - there's a lot you can do with it but I
10:50 - just wanted to give you a quick intro
10:52 - just to kind of show you to get you
10:55 - started so just you know go in there and
10:57 - start messing around with it and and see
11:01 - what you come up with so hopefully this
11:03 - was useful for you guys and thanks for
11:06 - watching

hey everybody I wanted to do a quick video on getting started with aliases in the terminal pretty much what an alias is is it's just a shortcut for running for running terminal commands one or more terminal commands if you find yourself typing in the same commands over and over and over then it's usually a good idea to make an alias for that and it's gonna save you a lot of typing and also lets you work a lot faster so I'm already over here in the terminal so to start out let's go ahead and do a simple and we'll just write an alias to change directory to the desktop so normally how we would
