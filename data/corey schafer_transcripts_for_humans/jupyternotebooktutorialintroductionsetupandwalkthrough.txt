00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be learning
00:02 - how to get started with using Jupiter
00:04 - notebooks now if you don't know what a
00:06 - Jupiter notebook is this is basically a
00:08 - way for us to run code interactively
00:10 - within a web browser alongside some
00:12 - visualizations and some markdown text to
00:15 - explain the process of what's going on
00:17 - now this Jupiter project evolved out of
00:19 - I python so if you've ever used IPython
00:21 - or heard uh someone talking about that
00:24 - then that has now been rolled into this
00:25 - Jupiter project and there are some good
00:27 - reasons behind that that I won't go into
00:29 - too much detail about here uh but they
00:31 - have an entire blog post on their
00:33 - website if anyone is interested so
00:35 - before we even get started let me show
00:37 - you why this is useful and how powerful
00:39 - something like this can be uh so a lot
00:41 - of scientific institutions are using
00:43 - these notebooks in order to clearly
00:45 - explain exactly how they got the results
00:47 - and not only can these notebooks show us
00:49 - how they got the results but we can
00:50 - reproduce the results from within the
00:52 - notebooks themselves so some of you may
00:54 - have heard of ligo that's the
00:56 - observatory that detected gravitational
00:58 - waves in the late 2015 uh they actually
01:00 - put out some of their research in
01:01 - Notebook form so I have one of their
01:03 - notebooks pulled up here which walks you
01:05 - through how you can replicate some of
01:07 - their processing using their own data
01:09 - and you can see that this isn't just uh
01:12 - python code but they also have some
01:14 - markdown code which uh gets displayed as
01:17 - the instructions and also describes
01:19 - exactly what's going on here but you can
01:22 - see if we scroll down here we have a lot
01:24 - of markdown code that's describing
01:26 - what's going on we see some python code
01:28 - and we see some charts here
01:30 - so the way that some of these notebooks
01:32 - are laid out it almost looks like a blog
01:34 - post or a textbook or something like
01:37 - that but these charts and everything
01:39 - that we see here these aren't just uh
01:42 - static visualizations like some PDF file
01:45 - or something like that these are
01:47 - visualizations that were produced right
01:49 - here in the browser by the code that
01:50 - we're looking at and we can even tweak
01:52 - this code and rerun these CS to get
01:54 - different results so for example here we
01:56 - see this chart that was produced by this
01:59 - this code here and I've actually come
02:01 - into this cell here then I can change
02:04 - this xais label instead of an S there I
02:08 - can change that to seconds and if I
02:10 - rerun that cell then you can see that
02:13 - this plot gets recreated right here
02:15 - within our browser interactively um so
02:17 - you can see how that's a really cool
02:19 - concept of being able to interact with
02:21 - the data and the code in this way and
02:23 - you can see why uh notebooks like this
02:25 - would be becoming very popular so that's
02:28 - what we're going to do in this video
02:29 - we're going to learn how we can get
02:31 - Jupiter installed and how we can create
02:34 - our own notebooks get set up with
02:36 - different kernels with this Within These
02:38 - notebooks and also how to navigate
02:39 - around execute code and also some cool
02:42 - tips and tricks okay so let's go ahead
02:44 - and get started with installing Jupiter
02:47 - uh so I have the Jupiter documentation
02:49 - pulled up here on their installation
02:50 - page and you can see that they actually
02:54 - recommend installing Jupiter by using
02:56 - the Anaconda python distribution and I
02:59 - have a separate video where I walk
03:00 - through the installation of anaconda and
03:02 - some of the benefits that you get from
03:04 - that and one of those benefits is that
03:06 - Jupiter comes bundled in with that
03:08 - installation so I'm going to use Jupiter
03:11 - for this walkth through the using the
03:13 - Anaconda distribution but if you don't
03:15 - want to use Anana then they also have
03:17 - the PIP installation instructions here
03:20 - as well so either method is up to you um
03:23 - but I would recommend installing
03:25 - anaconda and that's what I'm going to
03:27 - use for this video so once you run
03:29 - through the process proc of either
03:30 - installing anaconda or doing the PIP
03:33 - installs then now we can just pull up
03:35 - our terminals here and I'm going to kill
03:39 - that notebook server that was running
03:42 - the ligo notebooks and I'm going to CD
03:46 - into a blank directory here that is
03:50 - completely empty so now I'm starting
03:53 - from scratch in this directory if I do
03:54 - an ls- LA on a Mac this is going to list
03:57 - out all the files and directories and
03:59 - you can see that it's completely empty
04:01 - so now within this demo directory to
04:04 - start a new notebook we just have to say
04:07 - Jupiter notebook and if I run that it's
04:10 - going to start a server and pop up with
04:13 - this dashboard here and this is on our
04:15 - Local Host Port
04:17 - 8888 now that server that we started up
04:19 - in our terminal you have to leave that
04:22 - running that's called a notebook server
04:24 - and if we were to close that window and
04:26 - shut down that server then we wouldn't
04:28 - be able to access our uh notebooks
04:31 - within our Local Host so you have to
04:33 - leave that running and you can see that
04:34 - currently in our dashboard here that we
04:36 - don't have much here if we had any files
04:38 - or folders in that test directory uh
04:40 - where we started that notebook server
04:42 - from then those would show up here but
04:45 - that directory was completely empty so
04:48 - we don't have anything here yet okay so
04:50 - let's go ahead and jump right into
04:52 - creating a new notebook and in order to
04:54 - create a new notebook you're going to
04:56 - have to have a kernel and the kernels
04:58 - are basically what programming language
05:00 - that you want to use uh so for python we
05:03 - could also have a separate kernel for
05:05 - python 2 and we'll go over how to set
05:08 - that up here in a little bit but for now
05:11 - I'm just going to go ahead and create a
05:13 - new notebook and this is going to say
05:15 - python root and python root on my
05:18 - machine is Python 3 and so I'm going to
05:21 - go ahead and select that okay so now we
05:23 - have a completely blank notebook here
05:26 - now if this is your first time using a
05:28 - Jupiter notebook then would recommend
05:30 - coming up here and clicking on this help
05:32 - section here and first let's go to this
05:35 - user interface tour now this tour will
05:37 - give a popup on your screen that you can
05:39 - just use your arrow keys to scroll
05:41 - through and it'll show you where certain
05:42 - things are so there it's showing us how
05:45 - to uh change the file name for the
05:46 - notebook and how uh some of these menu
05:50 - bars uh what the icons mean and things
05:52 - like that and also the mode indicators
05:55 - it'll just kind of walk you through how
05:57 - everything is laid out but for now I'm
05:58 - going to go ahead head and exit out of
06:00 - that and also let's go up here back to
06:03 - this help menu and now let's click on
06:06 - this keyboard shortcuts now depending if
06:08 - you're on Mac or Windows these modifier
06:11 - Keys may be different for you um but if
06:13 - you do scroll down here it shows you all
06:15 - the keyboard shortcuts that you can use
06:16 - within either command mode or edit mode
06:19 - and we'll talk about both of those in
06:20 - just a second so I'm going to go ahead
06:22 - and close this down uh but if you ever
06:24 - do want to see either of those again the
06:27 - user interface tour or the keyboard
06:28 - shortcuts they're right here in The Help
06:30 - menu okay so the first thing that I'm
06:32 - going to do with our notebook is I'm
06:33 - just going to go up here and change this
06:35 - from Untitled and I'm just going to call
06:38 - this uh testing Jupiter and I'll go
06:41 - ahead and hit okay there so now that
06:42 - renames our I python notebook file okay
06:47 - so now let's actually look at adding
06:49 - some content to our notebook so
06:51 - notebooks have two different modes they
06:54 - have something called command mode and
06:55 - the other is edit mode so command mode
06:58 - allows us to perform actions like adding
07:00 - and deleting cells and you can put
07:02 - yourself in command mode by hitting the
07:04 - Escape key and the edit mode will allow
07:07 - us to edit our cells and you can put
07:09 - yourself in edit mode by hitting the
07:11 - enter key and we can also just click
07:14 - into a cell to enter edit mode and you
07:16 - can see when I did that we got this
07:18 - green highlight around the cell so
07:20 - that's an indication that we're in edit
07:22 - mode and another indication is up here
07:25 - in the top right you see that we have
07:27 - this pencil icon here if if I hover over
07:30 - that you can see that that says edit
07:31 - mode now if I hit the Escape key to go
07:34 - back to command mode then you can see
07:37 - that that pencil disappears and also our
07:39 - cell here turned blue but I did want to
07:42 - edit that cell so let's go ahead and
07:43 - just click in there again and now let's
07:46 - uh just add some simple code so I'm just
07:47 - going to do a simple print hello world
07:52 - okay so now that we have some code
07:54 - within our cell how do we execute this
07:56 - so if I just press enter you can see
07:58 - that I'm just adding more lines to my
08:01 - python code here um so if I want to
08:03 - execute this code then I can come up
08:06 - here to this cell menu and you can see
08:08 - that we have three different options
08:10 - here I can either run the cell run the
08:12 - cell and select below or run the cell
08:15 - and insert below so let's go ahead and
08:17 - walk through these so if I just run the
08:20 - cell then you can see that it executes
08:23 - the code that was in our cell and
08:25 - displays the output below here and the
08:28 - cell that we just ran is still selected
08:30 - now if I come up here and do a run sell
08:34 - and select below if I do that then you
08:38 - can see that it executes the code in our
08:40 - cell and then it selected the cell below
08:44 - that one now if there isn't a cell below
08:46 - it which there wasn't then it will just
08:48 - insert a cell there so if I select this
08:51 - top cell again and rerun that then you
08:54 - can see that it didn't add another cell
08:57 - but it did execute that code and then
08:59 - and selected that cell below that and
09:02 - lastly if I just choose our top cell
09:04 - here again and do this run and insert
09:08 - below you can see that even though there
09:10 - was an empty cell below here it still ex
09:13 - it still inserted this cell um below the
09:17 - cell that we just executed so those are
09:19 - the differences between those three
09:21 - different options there and the shortcut
09:24 - keys for those at least on a Mac is
09:26 - control enter to just execute the cell
09:29 - that you're currently in and stay there
09:32 - uh shift enter will execute the cell and
09:35 - move to the next one so that's execute
09:38 - the cell and select below and the option
09:42 - enter is to execute the cell and insert
09:45 - below so you can see that that inserted
09:47 - another cell below after I executed that
09:50 - content now for the rest of the video
09:52 - I'm going to be using those keyboard
09:53 - shortcuts just so that I can move a
09:55 - little bit more quickly here I'm not
09:57 - going to be coming up and clicking on
09:59 - this cell to run the cell every time so
10:02 - um if you see code executing it's
10:04 - because I'm using those keyboard
10:06 - shortcuts now one thing about the python
10:08 - code here is that this actually behaves
10:10 - kind of like an interactive prompt so I
10:12 - don't actually have to print this out
10:14 - here if I instead just came in here and
10:17 - did hello world just like we would if we
10:20 - started up python in a terminal or
10:22 - something like that if I go ahead and
10:24 - rerun that then you can see that we get
10:26 - the same output okay so you may have
10:28 - noticed these incrementing numbers here
10:30 - beside the cell where it says in 13 and
10:33 - out 13 here now this is something that
10:36 - you have to get used to when working
10:37 - with these notebooks so these cells
10:39 - don't necessarily have to be executed
10:41 - from top to bottom like we're used to in
10:44 - regular scripts so these numbers show us
10:46 - the order in which these cells were
10:48 - executed so for example if I replace
10:52 - this top code here and I just say name
10:54 - is equal to John and I execute that now
10:58 - current ly that doesn't give us any
11:00 - output but in this next cell I'm just
11:03 - going to say name and go ahead and run
11:06 - that you can see that the output is John
11:09 - now that's what we'd expect so far but
11:11 - in this next cell I'm going to reset
11:13 - this name value here and I'm just going
11:15 - to say name is equal to Corey and I'm
11:18 - going to go ahead and run that and now
11:21 - if I come back here to this top cell and
11:24 - rerun this code here now you can see
11:26 - that that name variable printed out as
11:28 - having the value of Corey even though we
11:31 - didn't make that assignment until after
11:33 - that sell and it's because these numbers
11:35 - here determine the execution order uh
11:38 - not just how things are assigned from
11:40 - top to bottom now with that said you
11:42 - still want these notebooks to be
11:43 - readable and easy to understand so I
11:45 - would still suggest putting things in
11:47 - the correct order from top to bottom um
11:49 - but if you ever have a variable that uh
11:52 - doesn't have the value that you think it
11:54 - should have then you might want to check
11:55 - these numbers here on the side to make
11:57 - sure that your execution order
11:59 - isn't out of whack or anything like that
12:01 - now if you do get things mixed up and
12:03 - you just want to uh treat this like a
12:05 - normal script and run everything from
12:07 - top to bottom uh then we can come up
12:10 - here to the cell menu here and we can
12:13 - just click on run all and that will run
12:16 - all of the cells from top to bottom now
12:18 - if I rerun that then you can see that it
12:20 - prints out um all of these numbers here
12:23 - are 192 they're all in order from top to
12:25 - bottom and our name variable is what we
12:27 - would expect in a regular script and
12:30 - also you may have seen in that cell drop
12:32 - down here that we also have the options
12:35 - of being able to uh execute all of the
12:38 - cells above or below our current cell so
12:41 - if you have some cells that take a long
12:43 - time to compute and only want to
12:45 - re-execute all of the cells below that
12:47 - point then you have the flexibility to
12:49 - do that okay so that's how you execute
12:52 - some basic code from within the cells so
12:55 - now let's look at how we can add some
12:56 - markup so markup is text that gets
12:59 - translated to HTML and we can use it
13:02 - within our notebooks to explain exactly
13:04 - what's going on and we saw a lot of that
13:07 - and the ligo example at the beginning of
13:09 - the video so let's say that I wanted to
13:11 - add some markdown to the top of this
13:13 - document here so first I'm going to
13:15 - select this top cell and now I'm going
13:18 - to add a new cell to the Top by going
13:20 - insert and then insert cell above and
13:23 - now with that top cell selected I'm
13:25 - going to come up here and click sell go
13:28 - down to cell type and I'm going to
13:30 - choose markdown now this isn't a
13:32 - markdown tutorial so I'm not going to go
13:35 - into detail about exactly what markdown
13:38 - text gets translated in HTML but I'm
13:40 - just going to drop in some sample
13:42 - markdown from a Snippets file that I
13:45 - have pulled up here so I'm just going to
13:46 - grab all of this sample mark down here
13:50 - and I'm just going to paste this into
13:51 - our top cell now you can see that while
13:53 - we're still on our edit mode here it
13:55 - kind of gives us a little sample of what
13:58 - we're going to get once once we actually
13:59 - execute this cell um but we still have
14:02 - our mark down here that hasn't been
14:03 - translated completely yet so I'm going
14:05 - to go ahead and just run that by hitting
14:07 - control enter Then when we run that you
14:10 - can see that our markdown got translated
14:12 - to HTML so we have a header here a
14:15 - header two a list and we have um some
14:19 - metallics and bold and things like that
14:22 - okay so that's how you can add mark down
14:23 - to a notebook now let's take a look at
14:25 - some other useful features that we can
14:27 - use Within These notebooks so our
14:29 - current kernel here is using python so
14:33 - any normal code that we add to our cells
14:35 - here will be interpreted as python code
14:38 - but there are some special commands that
14:39 - we can use within our cells that won't
14:42 - just be seen as python code um so for
14:45 - example here I'm going to add another
14:47 - cell here below this um so one of these
14:50 - special commands is if you put an
14:52 - exclamation point then it'll interpret
14:56 - this command as a bash command so if I
14:58 - do exclamation point and do like a pip
15:01 - list and run that then you can see that
15:04 - the output that you get from that uh
15:06 - would be the same as the output if you
15:08 - were to run that command from within the
15:10 - command line so that's kind of cool that
15:12 - you can run these bash commands from
15:14 - directly within the notebook now these
15:16 - notebooks also come with a bunch of
15:18 - built-in commands that they call Magics
15:21 - so if you've looked at notebooks before
15:23 - then you may have seen these these are
15:25 - the ones that begin with either 1% sign
15:28 - or two percent signs so the single
15:30 - percent sign means that the commands
15:32 - arguments will all come from that same
15:35 - line and those are called line Magics
15:37 - and the two% signs uh these mean that
15:40 - the entire cell will be used as that
15:43 - command's arguments and those are called
15:45 - cell Magics so we can actually use one
15:48 - of these magic commands to list all of
15:51 - the other available commands and the
15:53 - command to list all those is called LS
15:56 - magic so if I put a percent sign sign
15:59 - and do LS magic and then run that cell
16:03 - so now you can see that lists out all of
16:05 - these magic commands that we can use and
16:07 - it splits these up into line Magics here
16:10 - and cell Magics here so let's go ahead
16:13 - and take a look at a couple of these so
16:15 - I'm going to go ahead and insert a cell
16:18 - below here so that we can still see all
16:20 - of these Magics as we're working with
16:23 - these um so now if I wanted to print out
16:25 - my uh current working directory then I
16:28 - could just use a single percent sign
16:30 - here and do a PWD for print working
16:34 - directory if I run that then you can see
16:36 - that it shows the directory that we're
16:38 - currently in and you can see in this
16:40 - list of available line Magics they also
16:42 - have an LS here so I can list the files
16:45 - and folders within that directory by
16:47 - doing an LS and if I run that you can
16:50 - see that currently we just have our
16:52 - single I python notebook file now I can
16:55 - also pass normal commands to these just
16:57 - like I would within a terminal so if I
17:00 - do an ls- LA then it'll do the long form
17:03 - of those and you can see that there are
17:06 - uh more files and it lists out the users
17:09 - and permissions and things like that
17:11 - okay so those two commands that I just
17:12 - showed you are just similar to just
17:14 - being able to run bash commands within
17:16 - our notebook which we've already looked
17:18 - at but there are some of these magic
17:20 - commands that give us some functionality
17:22 - Beyond just the bash commands so one of
17:25 - the more common magic commands that
17:27 - you'll see within note books is the Matt
17:29 - plot lib inline command and that is Matt
17:34 - plot lib and then in line so what that
17:39 - does is it allows Matt plot lib charts
17:41 - to be displayed within our notebook so
17:44 - I'm actually not going to execute this
17:47 - just yet and I'm going to exec or insert
17:50 - a cell below here and first I'm going to
17:53 - grab some sample code here from my
17:56 - Snippets that will create a very simple
18:00 - matplot lib chart so I'm just going to
18:02 - go ahead and copy that and paste that in
18:05 - here now this sample here is just some
18:07 - snippet code that I got directly from
18:09 - the matplot lib documentation um so if I
18:12 - paste this in here and try to run this
18:15 - without first running this inline
18:17 - command so I'm going to execute this and
18:19 - try to uh show this plot and you can see
18:22 - that this is just sitting here spinning
18:24 - it's not doing anything and if we look
18:26 - over here this asteris just means that
18:28 - it's still trying to run this cell to
18:30 - completion so I'm just going to kill
18:32 - this by coming up here to Kernel and I'm
18:35 - just going to do a restart and clear
18:38 - output and go ahead and hit yes on that
18:41 - so now I'm going to try to run this
18:43 - again but first i'm going to execute
18:44 - this m plot lib inline magic command
18:47 - first so if I run that and now you can
18:51 - see that it executed with that one there
18:53 - now I'm just going to go ahead and try
18:54 - to display this chart within our
18:56 - notebook so now you can see after we ran
18:58 - that uh setup command there that our
19:00 - plot shows up directly in the notebook
19:03 - now this is extremely useful so this is
19:05 - where we really start to see why these
19:07 - notebooks are becoming really popular
19:09 - because to be able to show plots and
19:11 - things like that as we're stepping
19:12 - through our code it really helps you
19:14 - explore your data and code in real time
19:16 - without needing to uh rerun the entire
19:19 - script okay so let me show you just a
19:21 - couple more of these magic commands that
19:24 - I think that you'll find uh really
19:26 - useful when you start using these
19:28 - notebooks so we can see that one of the
19:30 - cell magic commands here is this uh
19:34 - percent sign percent 2% signs HTML and
19:38 - that will allow us to render HTML
19:40 - directly without using the markdown that
19:42 - we looked at before and this is a cell
19:45 - magic command which means that the
19:47 - entire cell uh will be rendered as HTML
19:51 - and not just the single line so just to
19:53 - show you an example of this I'm going to
19:55 - go back to my Snippets code here I'm
19:57 - just going to grab an iframe and this
20:00 - iframe is just going to uh pull up one
20:02 - of my uh other YouTube videos so if I go
20:05 - ahead and run this cell and you can see
20:08 - that we can actually embed this iframe
20:10 - directly in um our notebook here and
20:14 - really you can use that to render any
20:15 - kind of HTML that you'd want so you can
20:18 - render images or links or anything like
20:21 - that directly within at the notebook
20:22 - here so I'm not going to show an example
20:25 - of all of these commands but I do kind
20:27 - of want to highlight a couple of things
20:29 - that you can do so you can see that they
20:31 - also have a JavaScript command here so
20:34 - that would be everything that you wrote
20:35 - in that cell would get interpreted as
20:38 - JavaScript code um you can see that they
20:40 - have a Bash one here so that you can
20:42 - actually write out a series of bash
20:45 - commands in one cell now there's also a
20:47 - useful magic command here that we can
20:49 - use to time our python code and that is
20:53 - this time it command here so if I grab
20:56 - that I'm going to go ahead and
20:58 - insert another cell here at the bottom
21:01 - and I'm going to use this time it
21:03 - command um now you may have used time it
21:06 - in your regular Python scripts before
21:08 - but this allows us to easily add that
21:10 - functionality into our notebooks with
21:12 - just this one short command so let's say
21:15 - that you wanted to time a list
21:17 - comprehension where you squared the
21:19 - numbers up to a thousand or something
21:21 - like that so I think I have that example
21:24 - yeah so I have that example here in my
21:27 - Snippets so I'm just going to go ahead
21:28 - and grab that and paste it in and now if
21:31 - we run that cell then you can see it's
21:34 - actually going to run that time at
21:36 - command on our code there and then you
21:38 - can see that the output prints the
21:40 - output from that time at command and
21:42 - tells us the average time that it took
21:45 - to execute that so that can be really
21:47 - useful if you want to uh compare the
21:49 - execution time of different functions
21:51 - and things like that you can just add
21:53 - that time it command to the top of your
21:55 - cell and run those for multiple function
21:58 - and get the output right below your
21:59 - cells and like I said there's plenty
22:02 - more that you can do with those magic
22:03 - commands so if you do just run this LS
22:06 - magic command then you can see all the
22:08 - ones that are available for you here and
22:10 - you can just play around with any of
22:12 - these that you'd like now these Jupiter
22:14 - notebooks also have the ability to
22:16 - render certain things within the
22:18 - notebook without any kind of magic
22:20 - commands um so for example we can also
22:24 - display a panda's data frame from
22:27 - directly with in a notebook um now I
22:30 - thought I had a snippet for this but
22:32 - apparently I don't so I'll just go ahead
22:34 - and write this out really quick so if we
22:37 - want to import pandas I'll do import
22:39 - pandas as PD and import numpy as MP and
22:45 - now I'm just going to create a data
22:46 - frame here with some random value so
22:49 - I'll do a pandas data frame and I'm just
22:52 - going to put some random nump values in
22:54 - here so I'll do mp. random do Rand in
23:01 - and I will pass in 10 and five there and
23:05 - then underneath here I'm just going to
23:07 - go ahead and print out that data frame
23:09 - so if I run that code then you can see
23:12 - that just by printing out this data
23:14 - frame here it actually outputs that
23:17 - directly within our notebook in a nice
23:19 - readable form and so if I was to do a DF
23:23 - head there and rerun that then you can
23:26 - see it does the same thing with just
23:28 - those first few rows now if you don't
23:30 - know what these pandas data frames are
23:32 - that's not a big deal I just wanted to
23:34 - show you how you can display certain
23:35 - things within the notebooks that may be
23:38 - hard to visualize or display using a
23:40 - normal python script okay so another
23:42 - thing that I wanted to go over as far as
23:44 - these notebooks goes is that you can
23:47 - export these notebooks in several
23:49 - different formats so if I wanted to
23:51 - export this notebook in HTML so that I
23:53 - could add it to my blog or something
23:55 - like that then I could just come up here
23:57 - to file I could come to download as and
24:01 - you can see that we have a lot of
24:02 - different uh options here we could
24:04 - download this as a python file um I want
24:07 - to choose HTML so I'll download that as
24:09 - an HTML and if I open up that file I
24:12 - just downloaded you can see that we have
24:15 - an HTML version of this now these cells
24:18 - here I can't edit these since now it's
24:19 - HTML but I could post this in a blog or
24:22 - something like that and you can see that
24:24 - it's nice and readable has all of our
24:27 - code and all the output now if you
24:29 - actually wanted to share this notebook
24:31 - file uh with somebody then what is
24:35 - actually in these notebook files so let
24:37 - me go ahead and open one of these up in
24:40 - that's not the terminal window I want
24:42 - I'll go ahead and open up this blank one
24:44 - here so now if I do an LS here we can
24:47 - see that I have our IPython notebook
24:50 - file here so let's go ahead and see what
24:52 - this looks like if we open this up
24:54 - within a text editor so I just opened up
24:57 - our notebook file here within Sublime
25:00 - Text and we can see that it's really
25:02 - just a Json file that has all of the
25:05 - information in here that we need so
25:08 - that's how these files are actually
25:09 - structured in the background okay so
25:12 - another thing that I wanted to mention
25:13 - about these notebooks is at the
25:15 - beginning of this video I mentioned that
25:19 - we could create multiple kernels using
25:22 - multiple versions of python so if I do a
25:26 - new uh notebook here you can see that we
25:29 - have python root which on my machine is
25:31 - Python 3 you can see I also have this
25:33 - python 2 kernel here so how do you go
25:36 - about installing a python 2 kernel now
25:39 - this is another instance where I think
25:41 - it's a little bit more convenient to go
25:43 - with the Anaconda installation um
25:46 - because with the cond virtual
25:48 - environment set up all you have to do is
25:50 - install Jupiter within those virtual
25:52 - environments and then they will come up
25:54 - here as an option as a kernel when you
25:58 - create a new notebook so really this
26:00 - python 27 here is just a cond
26:04 - environment that came with Anaconda if I
26:07 - do AA EnV list then you can see that
26:11 - that python 27 is just in here in my
26:14 - anaconda environments and I go over how
26:16 - to create those Anaconda environments in
26:19 - my other Anaconda installation video now
26:22 - if you didn't go with the Anaconda
26:24 - installation then you can install a p
26:27 - python to Kernel uh if you go to their
26:30 - website then they have the PIP
26:33 - installation instructions that you need
26:35 - to go through in order to install a
26:37 - python 2 kernel okay and before I end
26:40 - the video here there's one last thing
26:41 - that I wanted uh to mention is that if
26:44 - you'd like some practice or to see how
26:46 - other people are using these notebooks
26:48 - then you can find a lot of examples
26:50 - online if you do a Google search for uh
26:54 - uh for Jupiter galleries one of the top
26:56 - results is this IPython GitHub page now
27:00 - there are also newer Jupiter notebooks
27:02 - on here also but they had made this page
27:05 - before the name change so it still says
27:07 - I python here um but if you go to this
27:10 - page then there are a lot of examples of
27:12 - notebooks that you can actually download
27:14 - uh directly and play around with so for
27:17 - example I'll just scroll down here to
27:19 - introductory tutorials and after I
27:21 - clicked on that I'll go here to
27:24 - collection of notebooks and from here we
27:27 - see a lot of sample notebooks that we
27:29 - can play around with so they have one
27:31 - about cell Magics and things like that
27:34 - um so if I get come down and click on
27:36 - this example for a trapezoid
27:40 - rule then you can see within this
27:42 - notebook here that they have some
27:44 - mathematical formulas they have some
27:46 - cell that have or some cells with some
27:48 - code and they also have some
27:50 - visualizations down here at the bottom
27:52 - um so if I wanted to I could actually
27:54 - come up here to the top right of this
27:56 - notebook and download this and so now I
28:00 - have that IPython notebook in my
28:02 - downloads folder so I'm just going to
28:04 - move that to my Jupiter demo I'm just
28:07 - going to say move from my downloads
28:10 - folder and that was called uh trapezoid
28:13 - Rule and I'm just going to move it into
28:16 - the directory that I am currently within
28:18 - here so now if I do an LS then we can
28:21 - see that we have that notebook in our uh
28:25 - demo directory there so now I'm going to
28:27 - go back to our dashboard and reload this
28:30 - you can see now we have that trapezoid
28:32 - Ru uh notebook so now I can click on
28:35 - that and I will just keep that as the
28:39 - Python 3 kernel and click okay and now
28:42 - you can see that we have that sample
28:43 - notebook that we can play around with on
28:45 - our own um so now we can see uh all of
28:49 - the cells that we saw on the website and
28:51 - if we want to see how they did something
28:53 - so for example if I wanted to see how
28:55 - they created this formula then we can
28:57 - just click on this cell and go into edit
29:00 - mode and we can see exactly how they
29:03 - created that and if I rerun that cell it
29:06 - reruns that code and creates that
29:08 - formula again okay so I think that's
29:11 - going to do it for this video um I hope
29:13 - this gave you all an idea for how you
29:14 - can begin using these Jupiter notebooks
29:17 - um they're really becoming popular it's
29:19 - a great way to explore your data and
29:21 - your code in an interactive way it's
29:23 - great for displaying plots and charts
29:26 - and panas data frames and all kinds of
29:28 - different things and it's also something
29:30 - that's already being used in real
29:32 - research so for example we saw the ligo
29:34 - notebook at the beginning of this video
29:36 - which showed some of their gravitational
29:39 - wave research and notebook form so it's
29:41 - definitely something that's nice to know
29:43 - how to use now if you do have any
29:45 - questions about what we covered here
29:46 - then feel free to ask in the comments
29:48 - section below and I'll do my best to
29:49 - answer those if you enjoy these
29:51 - tutorials and would like to support them
29:53 - then there are several ways you can do
29:54 - that the easiest way is to Simply like

Cleaned transcript:

hey there how's it going everybody in this video we're going to be learning how to get started with using Jupiter notebooks now if you don't know what a Jupiter notebook is this is basically a way for us to run code interactively within a web browser alongside some visualizations and some markdown text to explain the process of what's going on now this Jupiter project evolved out of I python so if you've ever used IPython or heard uh someone talking about that then that has now been rolled into this Jupiter project and there are some good reasons behind that that I won't go into too much detail about here uh but they have an entire blog post on their website if anyone is interested so before we even get started let me show you why this is useful and how powerful something like this can be uh so a lot of scientific institutions are using these notebooks in order to clearly explain exactly how they got the results and not only can these notebooks show us how they got the results but we can reproduce the results from within the notebooks themselves so some of you may have heard of ligo that's the observatory that detected gravitational waves in the late 2015 uh they actually put out some of their research in Notebook form so I have one of their notebooks pulled up here which walks you through how you can replicate some of their processing using their own data and you can see that this isn't just uh python code but they also have some markdown code which uh gets displayed as the instructions and also describes exactly what's going on here but you can see if we scroll down here we have a lot of markdown code that's describing what's going on we see some python code and we see some charts here so the way that some of these notebooks are laid out it almost looks like a blog post or a textbook or something like that but these charts and everything that we see here these aren't just uh static visualizations like some PDF file or something like that these are visualizations that were produced right here in the browser by the code that we're looking at and we can even tweak this code and rerun these CS to get different results so for example here we see this chart that was produced by this this code here and I've actually come into this cell here then I can change this xais label instead of an S there I can change that to seconds and if I rerun that cell then you can see that this plot gets recreated right here within our browser interactively um so you can see how that's a really cool concept of being able to interact with the data and the code in this way and you can see why uh notebooks like this would be becoming very popular so that's what we're going to do in this video we're going to learn how we can get Jupiter installed and how we can create our own notebooks get set up with different kernels with this Within These notebooks and also how to navigate around execute code and also some cool tips and tricks okay so let's go ahead and get started with installing Jupiter uh so I have the Jupiter documentation pulled up here on their installation page and you can see that they actually recommend installing Jupiter by using the Anaconda python distribution and I have a separate video where I walk through the installation of anaconda and some of the benefits that you get from that and one of those benefits is that Jupiter comes bundled in with that installation so I'm going to use Jupiter for this walkth through the using the Anaconda distribution but if you don't want to use Anana then they also have the PIP installation instructions here as well so either method is up to you um but I would recommend installing anaconda and that's what I'm going to use for this video so once you run through the process proc of either installing anaconda or doing the PIP installs then now we can just pull up our terminals here and I'm going to kill that notebook server that was running the ligo notebooks and I'm going to CD into a blank directory here that is completely empty so now I'm starting from scratch in this directory if I do an ls LA on a Mac this is going to list out all the files and directories and you can see that it's completely empty so now within this demo directory to start a new notebook we just have to say Jupiter notebook and if I run that it's going to start a server and pop up with this dashboard here and this is on our Local Host Port 8888 now that server that we started up in our terminal you have to leave that running that's called a notebook server and if we were to close that window and shut down that server then we wouldn't be able to access our uh notebooks within our Local Host so you have to leave that running and you can see that currently in our dashboard here that we don't have much here if we had any files or folders in that test directory uh where we started that notebook server from then those would show up here but that directory was completely empty so we don't have anything here yet okay so let's go ahead and jump right into creating a new notebook and in order to create a new notebook you're going to have to have a kernel and the kernels are basically what programming language that you want to use uh so for python we could also have a separate kernel for python 2 and we'll go over how to set that up here in a little bit but for now I'm just going to go ahead and create a new notebook and this is going to say python root and python root on my machine is Python 3 and so I'm going to go ahead and select that okay so now we have a completely blank notebook here now if this is your first time using a Jupiter notebook then would recommend coming up here and clicking on this help section here and first let's go to this user interface tour now this tour will give a popup on your screen that you can just use your arrow keys to scroll through and it'll show you where certain things are so there it's showing us how to uh change the file name for the notebook and how uh some of these menu bars uh what the icons mean and things like that and also the mode indicators it'll just kind of walk you through how everything is laid out but for now I'm going to go ahead head and exit out of that and also let's go up here back to this help menu and now let's click on this keyboard shortcuts now depending if you're on Mac or Windows these modifier Keys may be different for you um but if you do scroll down here it shows you all the keyboard shortcuts that you can use within either command mode or edit mode and we'll talk about both of those in just a second so I'm going to go ahead and close this down uh but if you ever do want to see either of those again the user interface tour or the keyboard shortcuts they're right here in The Help menu okay so the first thing that I'm going to do with our notebook is I'm just going to go up here and change this from Untitled and I'm just going to call this uh testing Jupiter and I'll go ahead and hit okay there so now that renames our I python notebook file okay so now let's actually look at adding some content to our notebook so notebooks have two different modes they have something called command mode and the other is edit mode so command mode allows us to perform actions like adding and deleting cells and you can put yourself in command mode by hitting the Escape key and the edit mode will allow us to edit our cells and you can put yourself in edit mode by hitting the enter key and we can also just click into a cell to enter edit mode and you can see when I did that we got this green highlight around the cell so that's an indication that we're in edit mode and another indication is up here in the top right you see that we have this pencil icon here if if I hover over that you can see that that says edit mode now if I hit the Escape key to go back to command mode then you can see that that pencil disappears and also our cell here turned blue but I did want to edit that cell so let's go ahead and just click in there again and now let's uh just add some simple code so I'm just going to do a simple print hello world okay so now that we have some code within our cell how do we execute this so if I just press enter you can see that I'm just adding more lines to my python code here um so if I want to execute this code then I can come up here to this cell menu and you can see that we have three different options here I can either run the cell run the cell and select below or run the cell and insert below so let's go ahead and walk through these so if I just run the cell then you can see that it executes the code that was in our cell and displays the output below here and the cell that we just ran is still selected now if I come up here and do a run sell and select below if I do that then you can see that it executes the code in our cell and then it selected the cell below that one now if there isn't a cell below it which there wasn't then it will just insert a cell there so if I select this top cell again and rerun that then you can see that it didn't add another cell but it did execute that code and then and selected that cell below that and lastly if I just choose our top cell here again and do this run and insert below you can see that even though there was an empty cell below here it still ex it still inserted this cell um below the cell that we just executed so those are the differences between those three different options there and the shortcut keys for those at least on a Mac is control enter to just execute the cell that you're currently in and stay there uh shift enter will execute the cell and move to the next one so that's execute the cell and select below and the option enter is to execute the cell and insert below so you can see that that inserted another cell below after I executed that content now for the rest of the video I'm going to be using those keyboard shortcuts just so that I can move a little bit more quickly here I'm not going to be coming up and clicking on this cell to run the cell every time so um if you see code executing it's because I'm using those keyboard shortcuts now one thing about the python code here is that this actually behaves kind of like an interactive prompt so I don't actually have to print this out here if I instead just came in here and did hello world just like we would if we started up python in a terminal or something like that if I go ahead and rerun that then you can see that we get the same output okay so you may have noticed these incrementing numbers here beside the cell where it says in 13 and out 13 here now this is something that you have to get used to when working with these notebooks so these cells don't necessarily have to be executed from top to bottom like we're used to in regular scripts so these numbers show us the order in which these cells were executed so for example if I replace this top code here and I just say name is equal to John and I execute that now current ly that doesn't give us any output but in this next cell I'm just going to say name and go ahead and run that you can see that the output is John now that's what we'd expect so far but in this next cell I'm going to reset this name value here and I'm just going to say name is equal to Corey and I'm going to go ahead and run that and now if I come back here to this top cell and rerun this code here now you can see that that name variable printed out as having the value of Corey even though we didn't make that assignment until after that sell and it's because these numbers here determine the execution order uh not just how things are assigned from top to bottom now with that said you still want these notebooks to be readable and easy to understand so I would still suggest putting things in the correct order from top to bottom um but if you ever have a variable that uh doesn't have the value that you think it should have then you might want to check these numbers here on the side to make sure that your execution order isn't out of whack or anything like that now if you do get things mixed up and you just want to uh treat this like a normal script and run everything from top to bottom uh then we can come up here to the cell menu here and we can just click on run all and that will run all of the cells from top to bottom now if I rerun that then you can see that it prints out um all of these numbers here are 192 they're all in order from top to bottom and our name variable is what we would expect in a regular script and also you may have seen in that cell drop down here that we also have the options of being able to uh execute all of the cells above or below our current cell so if you have some cells that take a long time to compute and only want to reexecute all of the cells below that point then you have the flexibility to do that okay so that's how you execute some basic code from within the cells so now let's look at how we can add some markup so markup is text that gets translated to HTML and we can use it within our notebooks to explain exactly what's going on and we saw a lot of that and the ligo example at the beginning of the video so let's say that I wanted to add some markdown to the top of this document here so first I'm going to select this top cell and now I'm going to add a new cell to the Top by going insert and then insert cell above and now with that top cell selected I'm going to come up here and click sell go down to cell type and I'm going to choose markdown now this isn't a markdown tutorial so I'm not going to go into detail about exactly what markdown text gets translated in HTML but I'm just going to drop in some sample markdown from a Snippets file that I have pulled up here so I'm just going to grab all of this sample mark down here and I'm just going to paste this into our top cell now you can see that while we're still on our edit mode here it kind of gives us a little sample of what we're going to get once once we actually execute this cell um but we still have our mark down here that hasn't been translated completely yet so I'm going to go ahead and just run that by hitting control enter Then when we run that you can see that our markdown got translated to HTML so we have a header here a header two a list and we have um some metallics and bold and things like that okay so that's how you can add mark down to a notebook now let's take a look at some other useful features that we can use Within These notebooks so our current kernel here is using python so any normal code that we add to our cells here will be interpreted as python code but there are some special commands that we can use within our cells that won't just be seen as python code um so for example here I'm going to add another cell here below this um so one of these special commands is if you put an exclamation point then it'll interpret this command as a bash command so if I do exclamation point and do like a pip list and run that then you can see that the output that you get from that uh would be the same as the output if you were to run that command from within the command line so that's kind of cool that you can run these bash commands from directly within the notebook now these notebooks also come with a bunch of builtin commands that they call Magics so if you've looked at notebooks before then you may have seen these these are the ones that begin with either 1% sign or two percent signs so the single percent sign means that the commands arguments will all come from that same line and those are called line Magics and the two% signs uh these mean that the entire cell will be used as that command's arguments and those are called cell Magics so we can actually use one of these magic commands to list all of the other available commands and the command to list all those is called LS magic so if I put a percent sign sign and do LS magic and then run that cell so now you can see that lists out all of these magic commands that we can use and it splits these up into line Magics here and cell Magics here so let's go ahead and take a look at a couple of these so I'm going to go ahead and insert a cell below here so that we can still see all of these Magics as we're working with these um so now if I wanted to print out my uh current working directory then I could just use a single percent sign here and do a PWD for print working directory if I run that then you can see that it shows the directory that we're currently in and you can see in this list of available line Magics they also have an LS here so I can list the files and folders within that directory by doing an LS and if I run that you can see that currently we just have our single I python notebook file now I can also pass normal commands to these just like I would within a terminal so if I do an ls LA then it'll do the long form of those and you can see that there are uh more files and it lists out the users and permissions and things like that okay so those two commands that I just showed you are just similar to just being able to run bash commands within our notebook which we've already looked at but there are some of these magic commands that give us some functionality Beyond just the bash commands so one of the more common magic commands that you'll see within note books is the Matt plot lib inline command and that is Matt plot lib and then in line so what that does is it allows Matt plot lib charts to be displayed within our notebook so I'm actually not going to execute this just yet and I'm going to exec or insert a cell below here and first I'm going to grab some sample code here from my Snippets that will create a very simple matplot lib chart so I'm just going to go ahead and copy that and paste that in here now this sample here is just some snippet code that I got directly from the matplot lib documentation um so if I paste this in here and try to run this without first running this inline command so I'm going to execute this and try to uh show this plot and you can see that this is just sitting here spinning it's not doing anything and if we look over here this asteris just means that it's still trying to run this cell to completion so I'm just going to kill this by coming up here to Kernel and I'm just going to do a restart and clear output and go ahead and hit yes on that so now I'm going to try to run this again but first i'm going to execute this m plot lib inline magic command first so if I run that and now you can see that it executed with that one there now I'm just going to go ahead and try to display this chart within our notebook so now you can see after we ran that uh setup command there that our plot shows up directly in the notebook now this is extremely useful so this is where we really start to see why these notebooks are becoming really popular because to be able to show plots and things like that as we're stepping through our code it really helps you explore your data and code in real time without needing to uh rerun the entire script okay so let me show you just a couple more of these magic commands that I think that you'll find uh really useful when you start using these notebooks so we can see that one of the cell magic commands here is this uh percent sign percent 2% signs HTML and that will allow us to render HTML directly without using the markdown that we looked at before and this is a cell magic command which means that the entire cell uh will be rendered as HTML and not just the single line so just to show you an example of this I'm going to go back to my Snippets code here I'm just going to grab an iframe and this iframe is just going to uh pull up one of my uh other YouTube videos so if I go ahead and run this cell and you can see that we can actually embed this iframe directly in um our notebook here and really you can use that to render any kind of HTML that you'd want so you can render images or links or anything like that directly within at the notebook here so I'm not going to show an example of all of these commands but I do kind of want to highlight a couple of things that you can do so you can see that they also have a JavaScript command here so that would be everything that you wrote in that cell would get interpreted as JavaScript code um you can see that they have a Bash one here so that you can actually write out a series of bash commands in one cell now there's also a useful magic command here that we can use to time our python code and that is this time it command here so if I grab that I'm going to go ahead and insert another cell here at the bottom and I'm going to use this time it command um now you may have used time it in your regular Python scripts before but this allows us to easily add that functionality into our notebooks with just this one short command so let's say that you wanted to time a list comprehension where you squared the numbers up to a thousand or something like that so I think I have that example yeah so I have that example here in my Snippets so I'm just going to go ahead and grab that and paste it in and now if we run that cell then you can see it's actually going to run that time at command on our code there and then you can see that the output prints the output from that time at command and tells us the average time that it took to execute that so that can be really useful if you want to uh compare the execution time of different functions and things like that you can just add that time it command to the top of your cell and run those for multiple function and get the output right below your cells and like I said there's plenty more that you can do with those magic commands so if you do just run this LS magic command then you can see all the ones that are available for you here and you can just play around with any of these that you'd like now these Jupiter notebooks also have the ability to render certain things within the notebook without any kind of magic commands um so for example we can also display a panda's data frame from directly with in a notebook um now I thought I had a snippet for this but apparently I don't so I'll just go ahead and write this out really quick so if we want to import pandas I'll do import pandas as PD and import numpy as MP and now I'm just going to create a data frame here with some random value so I'll do a pandas data frame and I'm just going to put some random nump values in here so I'll do mp. random do Rand in and I will pass in 10 and five there and then underneath here I'm just going to go ahead and print out that data frame so if I run that code then you can see that just by printing out this data frame here it actually outputs that directly within our notebook in a nice readable form and so if I was to do a DF head there and rerun that then you can see it does the same thing with just those first few rows now if you don't know what these pandas data frames are that's not a big deal I just wanted to show you how you can display certain things within the notebooks that may be hard to visualize or display using a normal python script okay so another thing that I wanted to go over as far as these notebooks goes is that you can export these notebooks in several different formats so if I wanted to export this notebook in HTML so that I could add it to my blog or something like that then I could just come up here to file I could come to download as and you can see that we have a lot of different uh options here we could download this as a python file um I want to choose HTML so I'll download that as an HTML and if I open up that file I just downloaded you can see that we have an HTML version of this now these cells here I can't edit these since now it's HTML but I could post this in a blog or something like that and you can see that it's nice and readable has all of our code and all the output now if you actually wanted to share this notebook file uh with somebody then what is actually in these notebook files so let me go ahead and open one of these up in that's not the terminal window I want I'll go ahead and open up this blank one here so now if I do an LS here we can see that I have our IPython notebook file here so let's go ahead and see what this looks like if we open this up within a text editor so I just opened up our notebook file here within Sublime Text and we can see that it's really just a Json file that has all of the information in here that we need so that's how these files are actually structured in the background okay so another thing that I wanted to mention about these notebooks is at the beginning of this video I mentioned that we could create multiple kernels using multiple versions of python so if I do a new uh notebook here you can see that we have python root which on my machine is Python 3 you can see I also have this python 2 kernel here so how do you go about installing a python 2 kernel now this is another instance where I think it's a little bit more convenient to go with the Anaconda installation um because with the cond virtual environment set up all you have to do is install Jupiter within those virtual environments and then they will come up here as an option as a kernel when you create a new notebook so really this python 27 here is just a cond environment that came with Anaconda if I do AA EnV list then you can see that that python 27 is just in here in my anaconda environments and I go over how to create those Anaconda environments in my other Anaconda installation video now if you didn't go with the Anaconda installation then you can install a p python to Kernel uh if you go to their website then they have the PIP installation instructions that you need to go through in order to install a python 2 kernel okay and before I end the video here there's one last thing that I wanted uh to mention is that if you'd like some practice or to see how other people are using these notebooks then you can find a lot of examples online if you do a Google search for uh uh for Jupiter galleries one of the top results is this IPython GitHub page now there are also newer Jupiter notebooks on here also but they had made this page before the name change so it still says I python here um but if you go to this page then there are a lot of examples of notebooks that you can actually download uh directly and play around with so for example I'll just scroll down here to introductory tutorials and after I clicked on that I'll go here to collection of notebooks and from here we see a lot of sample notebooks that we can play around with so they have one about cell Magics and things like that um so if I get come down and click on this example for a trapezoid rule then you can see within this notebook here that they have some mathematical formulas they have some cell that have or some cells with some code and they also have some visualizations down here at the bottom um so if I wanted to I could actually come up here to the top right of this notebook and download this and so now I have that IPython notebook in my downloads folder so I'm just going to move that to my Jupiter demo I'm just going to say move from my downloads folder and that was called uh trapezoid Rule and I'm just going to move it into the directory that I am currently within here so now if I do an LS then we can see that we have that notebook in our uh demo directory there so now I'm going to go back to our dashboard and reload this you can see now we have that trapezoid Ru uh notebook so now I can click on that and I will just keep that as the Python 3 kernel and click okay and now you can see that we have that sample notebook that we can play around with on our own um so now we can see uh all of the cells that we saw on the website and if we want to see how they did something so for example if I wanted to see how they created this formula then we can just click on this cell and go into edit mode and we can see exactly how they created that and if I rerun that cell it reruns that code and creates that formula again okay so I think that's going to do it for this video um I hope this gave you all an idea for how you can begin using these Jupiter notebooks um they're really becoming popular it's a great way to explore your data and your code in an interactive way it's great for displaying plots and charts and panas data frames and all kinds of different things and it's also something that's already being used in real research so for example we saw the ligo notebook at the beginning of this video which showed some of their gravitational wave research and notebook form so it's definitely something that's nice to know how to use now if you do have any questions about what we covered here then feel free to ask in the comments section below and I'll do my best to answer those if you enjoy these
