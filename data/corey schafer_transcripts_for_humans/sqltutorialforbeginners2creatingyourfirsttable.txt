00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video we're going to be creating a table
00:03 - for our database if you remember in the
00:06 - last video we created our sample
00:09 - database and we set up our SQL
00:11 - environment so that we could begin
00:13 - writing commands but currently our
00:16 - database is completely empty so let's go
00:18 - ahead and fix that the first thing that
00:21 - we need to do is populate our database
00:23 - with a table so a table is made up of
00:26 - columns and rows and the columns make up
00:29 - the fields and the structure of our
00:32 - table and those will hold our rows which
00:37 - represent individual records within our
00:39 - table and this will make more sense in a
00:41 - minute
00:42 - so when we first create our table we
00:45 - will have to also tell the table what
00:48 - columns we want our table to hold and
00:52 - when the table is first created it won't
00:55 - have any rows because rows will only be
00:58 - created once we begin adding records to
01:00 - our table so that may sound a little
01:02 - confusing but let's go ahead and create
01:04 - our first table and I think it'll make
01:05 - more sense so we're going to create a
01:08 - create table and we're going to call
01:11 - this table people now you're going to
01:14 - open up some parentheses here and I'm
01:17 - going to go ahead and make this on a new
01:18 - line here and now within these
01:20 - parentheses now we're going to create
01:22 - our fields which will be our columns so
01:25 - within this table people I want the
01:27 - fields ID and name and these fields have
01:33 - to be separated by a comma
01:36 - now these fields also need a datatype
01:38 - the table has to know what kind of data
01:41 - each field is going to hold now remember
01:44 - we are using Postgres as our SQL
01:46 - platform so we can view the different
01:49 - data types if we get online here and you
01:52 - type in Postgres
01:53 - data types then you can look at the
01:56 - Postgres documentation to view these
01:58 - data types so it's the very top link
02:00 - here and I've already got that opened up
02:01 - over here now this is a page that has
02:04 - the documentation of the data types now
02:07 - if we scroll down here then we can see
02:09 - the different data types that we can use
02:12 - whenever
02:13 - we create a table now I know that this
02:15 - looks like a lot of options and it is
02:16 - but don't get overwhelmed because a lot
02:20 - of the time you'll only be using a
02:21 - select few of these for your table so in
02:25 - our example we had the fields ID and
02:27 - name so we want ID to be an integer so
02:30 - if I look at the table here we can see
02:33 - that we have integer right here it says
02:35 - that it's assigned for byte integer and
02:37 - it also has a name integer and we can
02:39 - also use int or int for now the value
02:43 - that I'm going to use is integer so if I
02:44 - open up my GUI program again here then
02:48 - I'm going to put this before the comma
02:49 - right after the field name I'm going to
02:52 - type in integer and that is the data
02:54 - type that we want ID to be now for the
02:56 - name field I want that to be a variable
02:59 - length character string and if we look
03:01 - back at the documentation here we can
03:03 - see that we have this character varying
03:07 - and then the alias is far char and the
03:09 - description is exactly what we want a
03:10 - variable length character string now you
03:12 - can see that it also has this in here
03:15 - and what that in is is that is a number
03:18 - that we can put in that will be a
03:20 - maximum on the number of characters that
03:22 - can be added to this field so for
03:25 - example if I was to put 255 therefore
03:28 - that in then we wouldn't be able to add
03:31 - any records with a name longer than 255
03:35 - characters so let's go ahead and go back
03:37 - to our program here and I'm going to use
03:40 - a varchar' here and in the parentheses
03:43 - I'm going to go ahead and put in that
03:45 - 255 so this looks good we haven't run
03:47 - this yet but if we look back we are
03:49 - creating a table called people and
03:52 - within this table we're going to have
03:54 - two fields which will be our columns one
03:56 - is going to be ID which is an integer
03:58 - one is going to be name which is a
04:00 - variable length character string of 255
04:03 - characters max so let's go ahead and run
04:05 - this query and now if I go over here and
04:07 - refresh my tables then we can see that
04:10 - we now have this people table 1 if I
04:12 - click on the people table then you can
04:14 - see that we have a column here ID and a
04:16 - column here name so what if something
04:19 - was wrong with this table and we just
04:21 - wanted to delete the table all together
04:23 - now we in this GUI Pro
04:26 - we could just come over here and
04:27 - right-click and delete table but we're
04:29 - learning about sequel commands so we're
04:32 - going to do this in SQL now this is
04:36 - super easy to do that's just going to be
04:38 - the drop table command so we're just
04:40 - going to delete this and we're going to
04:42 - type in drop table and type in the name
04:46 - of our table which was people and let's
04:48 - put in a semicolon there I think I
04:51 - forgot this in my colon before you kind
04:53 - of want to get in the habit of adding
04:55 - those in so now if I run this query and
04:58 - then refresh my tables over here then
05:01 - you can see that the people table was
05:03 - deleted it got dropped so you want to be
05:06 - careful with the drop command because it
05:09 - will delete your table and all of the
05:10 - information that that table holds so now
05:13 - let's go ahead and recreate that table
05:16 - that we just deleted just to kind of get
05:18 - a firm grasp on this so you may want to
05:21 - type these from scratch a few times just
05:24 - to kind of get the feel for the syntax
05:25 - if you just copy and paste these
05:27 - commands over and over then you might
05:30 - not actually learn the commands as well
05:31 - as you think you are and you won't know
05:34 - how to do it from scratch when you don't
05:36 - have your clipboard clipboard available
05:38 - to you at a later time so let's go ahead
05:40 - and rewrite this create table again from
05:44 - scratch so create table people we'll put
05:47 - in our parentheses here and that was an
05:49 - ID with an integer and we'll put in our
05:52 - comma there and a name with far char 255
05:58 - let's go ahead and run that query
06:00 - refresh our tables over here and we can
06:03 - see that we now have our people table
06:05 - back with ID and name so there we go now
06:08 - we have our table back and in this video
06:11 - we created our first table we looked at
06:13 - columns and the different data types
06:16 - that we can use in the next video we're
06:18 - going to actually start putting records
06:20 - into our table and then we'll be able to
06:23 - kind of see how all of this comes
06:24 - together to create a simple database
06:26 - with all of the parts working together
06:28 - so be sure to check out that video if
06:31 - you guys have any questions just ask in
06:32 - the comment section below

hey everybody how's it going in this video we're going to be creating a table for our database if you remember in the last video we created our sample database and we set up our SQL environment so that we could begin writing commands but currently our database is completely empty so let's go ahead and fix that the first thing that we need to do is populate our database with a table so a table is made up of columns and rows and the columns make up the fields and the structure of our table and those will hold our rows which represent individual records within our table and this will make
