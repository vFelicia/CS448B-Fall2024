00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be learning
00:02 - how to install and use homebrew on the
00:04 - Mac operating system so homebrew is a
00:07 - package manager for Mac so you can kind
00:09 - of think of it like apt or yum for Linux
00:12 - systems or if you're more familiar with
00:13 - Python it then you can think of this as
00:15 - being the PIP of the Mac operating
00:17 - system now this is going to allow us to
00:19 - install software using the command line
00:21 - and a nice and easy to use way and I use
00:24 - this all the time for installing
00:25 - software or setting up new machines I
00:27 - actually just got a new MacBook the
00:29 - other day and I'm going to release a
00:31 - video soon after this one showing how I
00:33 - use homebrew to automate a large portion
00:35 - of the setup of a new development
00:37 - machine but in this video we're just
00:38 - going to learn the basics and how to use
00:40 - homebrew in general so let's go ahead
00:42 - and get started
00:43 - so first of all before we can install
00:44 - homebrew we need to have some command
00:46 - line tools installed and we can install
00:49 - these easily through Xcode so in an open
00:51 - terminal you can install these by saying
00:53 - Xcode - select and then - - install now
01:00 - I'm gonna get an error here because I
01:02 - already have these installed it says
01:03 - command line tools already installed so
01:06 - I've already done that but you might
01:07 - need to do that if you haven't yet but
01:09 - once we have those installed we should
01:11 - be able to now install homebrew so right
01:14 - now I don't have this installed if I try
01:16 - to run the brew command I can see that I
01:18 - get an error and it says brew command
01:20 - not found so to install homebrew we can
01:23 - simply go to their website and I have
01:25 - that open here in my browser and right
01:28 - at the top of their home page they have
01:29 - the installation command so I'm going to
01:32 - copy that and we can simply paste that
01:34 - into our terminal so it's this command
01:36 - here it's a ruby command that's going to
01:39 - run this Ruby script to install so I'm
01:42 - going to open back up my terminal here
01:45 - and now I'm just going to paste in that
01:48 - command it's gonna run it automatically
01:50 - and now it's going to ask us to walk
01:53 - through this so I'm going to and we're
01:56 - also going to need to put in our
01:57 - password as well so I'm just going to
02:00 - let this install and I'm going to pick
02:02 - the video back up once this is complete
02:04 - okay so that installation completed we
02:08 - can see here that it says installation
02:09 - successful so if you didn't have any
02:11 - errors that homebrew should have been
02:13 - installed correctly so we can test this
02:15 - simply by running brew help and if that
02:20 - doesn't give us an error and it actually
02:21 - shows us some brew commands here then it
02:24 - means that that installation was
02:25 - successful okay so now let's go over a
02:28 - few things and see how we can use
02:29 - homebrew so first of all if you want to
02:32 - list all of the packages that you can
02:34 - install with homebrew then we can simply
02:36 - say brew search and we can see that
02:40 - there are a lot of packages listed here
02:42 - that we can install now if we want to
02:44 - see how many packages that is exactly
02:46 - then we could pipe that into the Linux
02:48 - word count command I'm not going to go
02:50 - into the details of Linux commands in
02:52 - this video or piping commands but if you
02:54 - wanted the total lines from that output
02:56 - you could simply say brew search and
02:59 - pipe that into word count and then - L
03:01 - will count the number of lines so if I
03:04 - run that then that should display the
03:07 - number of packages that were displayed
03:08 - with that brew search command now if we
03:11 - wanted to narrow down those results and
03:13 - we don't want to look through all 4700
03:15 - of those then we could pass in a string
03:17 - to brew search as well so let's say that
03:20 - I wanted to install Postgres and wanted
03:22 - to search for that package so to do that
03:24 - I could simply say brew search Postgres
03:28 - and when I run that it's going to go out
03:30 - and search those packages and we can see
03:33 - here that it returns a few results so
03:35 - most likely to install Postgres I would
03:37 - use that formula of Postgres SQL now we
03:41 - can see that there are two sections here
03:43 - one R of these is called formula and the
03:46 - other here is cask we're going to talk
03:49 - more about the differences between those
03:51 - in just a bit and see some examples of
03:53 - both but basically formula typically
03:56 - deal with command-line software and cask
03:58 - is an extension of homebrew that allows
04:00 - us to install mac OS native applications
04:03 - like google chrome and stuff like that
04:05 - and we'll see more of that in just a bit
04:07 - so that's how we can search packages
04:09 - using brew but you can also view this in
04:12 - the browser as well
04:13 - and I have this page pulled up here and
04:15 - I'll leave a link to these in the
04:16 - description section below as well so we
04:18 - can see in the browser here all of the
04:21 - packages available here as well along
04:24 - with a short description of each
04:26 - and you can also search within here in
04:28 - the browser - so if I was to do
04:30 - something like Postgres then we can see
04:32 - that it pops up those same results and
04:34 - then you can get more detailed
04:36 - information about each package okay so
04:38 - now let's look at installing a package
04:41 - using homebrew okay so one package that
04:44 - I like to install with homebrew is
04:46 - called tree it's a nice simple program
04:48 - that prints out tree directory
04:50 - structures in the command line so if I
04:52 - was to try to do this right now then we
04:55 - can see it says that the tree command is
04:56 - not found so this isn't installed so to
04:59 - install this with using brew we can
05:01 - simply say brew install tree and that's
05:05 - going to go out and install that package
05:07 - and once that's finished I'm going to
05:09 - let this download finish here and once
05:12 - that's finished we should be able to now
05:13 - use that tree command so right now I'm
05:16 - in my home folder so I don't want to run
05:18 - tree here since it would show the tree
05:20 - structure of my entire home folder but
05:22 - instead let me CD to my desktop and I'll
05:25 - look at the tree structure of one of my
05:27 - projects there so I'm going to change
05:30 - directory into my desktop and here on my
05:33 - desktop I have my flask blog application
05:36 - from my flask series so I'm gonna run
05:39 - tree on that so I'll say tree and that's
05:42 - called flask blog so I'm going to run
05:44 - that and we can see that it shows a nice
05:46 - directory structure of that project here
05:50 - within our command line so I really like
05:52 - that program it's a nice way to get an
05:54 - overview of a project or a directory so
05:57 - that tree command is working nicely now
05:59 - that we installed it using homebrew so
06:01 - where does homebrew and actually install
06:03 - these packages now if I run the which
06:05 - command to see the path to tree if I say
06:08 - which tree then it looks like that this
06:12 - was installed in user local thin but
06:15 - that's actually just a symbolic link I
06:17 - can see that that's a symbolic link if I
06:19 - say LS - la and now I'm going to just
06:23 - copy this line here and I'm going to
06:27 - list out that directory there and we can
06:30 - see that this L here says that this is a
06:33 - link so this is the link here and then
06:35 - it's going to this location so this is
06:38 - up one directory
06:39 - which would be user local and then it's
06:42 - in this cellar directory and then it
06:45 - installs it in there so that is where
06:48 - homebrew is installing these packages is
06:50 - within this user local cellar directory
06:55 - now if we want to see more information
06:57 - about an installed package then we can
07:00 - do that by using the info command so let
07:03 - me clear my screen here I want to say
07:05 - brew info of tree and that's going to
07:09 - give us a description and where and when
07:11 - it was installed and also some analytic
07:14 - data now if we look at the info for an
07:17 - uninstalled package then it will show us
07:19 - the dependencies and things like that so
07:21 - if I was to clear my screen here and say
07:23 - brew info node and node is not currently
07:26 - installed then we can see here that it
07:28 - says not installed and it also tells us
07:31 - what dependencies it's needs and which
07:33 - ones we already have the red X here
07:36 - means that none of these dependencies
07:38 - are currently installed and if we did
07:41 - have one of those dependencies installed
07:43 - then it would instead be a green
07:44 - checkmark ok so yeah that info command
07:47 - can give you some pretty useful
07:48 - information now to uninstall a package
07:51 - we can simply run the uninstall command
07:53 - so brew uninstall tree and that will go
07:57 - out and uninstall that tree command that
07:59 - we just installed earlier now one really
08:01 - interesting thing with homebrew is that
08:03 - we can use it to install new versions of
08:06 - certain tools that will overwrite max
08:08 - bsd version of the same tool now I'm not
08:11 - gonna go into a lot of details there but
08:13 - basically a lot of people like the Linux
08:15 - can new version of some tools a lot more
08:17 - than the default Mac BSD version so one
08:20 - of the example of that would be the grep
08:22 - command so if I look at the version of
08:25 - the default grep command within Mac then
08:29 - we can see that this says BSD grep so
08:32 - this is the BSD version of grep but if I
08:35 - look at the info for the grep package on
08:37 - home brew if I say brew info grep then
08:42 - we can see that this says this is new
08:45 - grep so that's the Linux canoe version
08:47 - of grip so does that mean that if we
08:49 - install grep using brew that it will
08:52 - overwrite
08:53 - our max default grep command well not
08:56 - really but we could do that if we wanted
08:58 - to if we look down here at the caveat
09:00 - section within this information then we
09:03 - can see that it says all commands have
09:05 - been installed with the prefix G if you
09:07 - need to use these commands with their
09:09 - normal names you can add the new bin
09:11 - directory to your path for your bash RC
09:14 - or in Mac's case sometimes your bash
09:16 - underscore profile so that means that
09:18 - the grep command is going to have a g--
09:21 - prefix so it's going to be G grep so
09:23 - just to show you this let me actually
09:25 - install that so I'll say brew install
09:27 - grep and it's going to go out and
09:30 - install this and I will let this finish
09:32 - and when that finishes it shows us here
09:35 - at the end that same caveat that it
09:38 - displayed in the info that this actually
09:40 - has a prefix of G and how we could set
09:42 - the path if we didn't want that prefix
09:44 - so now we have grep installed but that's
09:48 - going to have a prefix of G so if it's
09:51 - do G grep - - version then we can see
09:55 - that that is good new grep but it did
09:58 - not overwrite my Mac version this is
10:00 - still BSD grip and again if you did want
10:03 - to replace the default version of grep
10:04 - instead of using G grep then you could
10:08 - do what they said and add that ganoub in
10:10 - directory to your path now personally I
10:12 - prefer the new version of tools and my
10:14 - day to day coding but I don't have them
10:16 - installed anymore now that I'm doing
10:18 - these tutorials I never want to have
10:20 - commands configured differently on my
10:22 - machine that might work in a certain way
10:24 - now that don't work for someone else
10:26 - who's falling along with a video so I
10:28 - would recommend these types of tools
10:30 - even though I no longer use them myself
10:33 - because I'm doing these videos okay so
10:35 - now let's look at how you to update
10:36 - packages so first of all to see what
10:39 - packages we currently have installed we
10:41 - can simply say brew list and we can see
10:45 - there that we have two packages the
10:47 - other package here was just a dependency
10:49 - for grep so if we wanted to update our
10:51 - packages none of these will need update
10:54 - since we just installed them but if we
10:56 - did want to update them it's a very
10:57 - similar process to something like apt on
11:00 - Linux so we would just simply say let me
11:04 - clear the screen here we could simply
11:06 - say brew
11:07 - update and that will fetch the newest
11:10 - version of all of the packages and then
11:12 - if we wanted to view the outdated
11:14 - packages we could say brew outdated and
11:17 - that would show us all of the packages
11:20 - that have an updated version available
11:22 - then to actually update those outdated
11:24 - packages then we would then say brew
11:27 - upgrade and run that so anyone familiar
11:30 - with Linux that should be a familiar
11:33 - process because it's how it's done on
11:35 - there as well now by default brew
11:38 - doesn't actually uninstall old versions
11:40 - of a package so over time you might
11:42 - accumulate old versions but to remove
11:44 - those you can simply run a command
11:46 - called brew clean up and that will go
11:48 - out and remove all of the older versions
11:51 - of those packages so that might be
11:53 - something that you want to put into a
11:55 - cron job to run occasionally or
11:57 - something like that now if you ever run
11:59 - into any problems with homebrew and need
12:01 - to check your system for potential
12:04 - problems then brew also comes with a
12:06 - self-diagnosis tool that does this for
12:09 - you and that is called brew dr so if we
12:11 - run brew dr then that's going to
12:14 - diagnose your system and could let you
12:16 - know of any issues that it finds
12:18 - and this might print out a lot of
12:20 - warnings here but if I scroll up here at
12:23 - the top you can see that we have a lot
12:24 - of warnings but if I scroll up to the
12:26 - top then we can see it says please note
12:28 - that these warnings are just used to
12:30 - help homebrew maintainer zhh with
12:32 - debugging if you file an issue but if
12:35 - everything that you use homebrew for is
12:36 - working fine then please don't worry or
12:39 - file an issue just ignore it so home
12:41 - brews working fine for me I'm just going
12:43 - to ignore that output but if I did have
12:46 - any problems then that output there can
12:48 - help the maintainer z' possibly find
12:50 - what the issue is ok so now let's look
12:53 - at what I think is one of the coolest
12:54 - things about homebrew so so far we've
12:57 - installed some command line tools but we
12:59 - can actually install Mac applications as
13:01 - well and I usually use this when i want
13:03 - to write a script to easily set up a new
13:05 - machine and the way that we install this
13:07 - is with a homebrew extension called cask
13:10 - and it's super easy to use
13:12 - so we just need to say brew cask install
13:15 - instead of just brew install like we did
13:17 - before so for example let's say that we
13:20 - wanted to install
13:21 - phox we could just simply say brew cask
13:24 - install firefox and if i run that then
13:28 - that's gonna actually go out and install
13:30 - Firefox for us now this can take a
13:32 - second since it's installing a larger
13:34 - piece of software but I think it's a lot
13:36 - easier than going out to the Firefox
13:37 - website and going through their setup
13:39 - and then dragging and dropping the
13:41 - application to your Applications folder
13:43 - and all of that this is just one easy
13:45 - step to install this so I'm going to let
13:48 - this finish and then we'll pick up the
13:50 - video after this is done okay so we can
13:53 - see here that it says Firefox was
13:54 - successfully installed and it also moved
13:56 - that Firefox tap into my Applications
13:59 - folder now I uninstalled Firefox before
14:03 - this video began so if I run this then
14:07 - we can see that Firefox was actually
14:09 - reinstalled on my machine so that worked
14:11 - properly and sometimes when you're
14:13 - opening something for the first time
14:14 - you'll get this warning here I'm just
14:16 - going to go ahead and click open and
14:18 - this opened in the background here so we
14:21 - can see that that installation worked
14:22 - and that Firefox is working for us so
14:24 - that's good and you can use cast to
14:26 - install all kinds of different software
14:28 - brew cask also has a search command just
14:31 - like brew has so let's say that we
14:33 - wanted to install PyCharm so let's
14:35 - search for that so I'll say brew search
14:38 - and I'll search for PyCharm and when we
14:41 - do that sometimes this takes a second to
14:43 - get results back so we can see that we
14:45 - got a few results but the first result
14:48 - here is probably the one that we want
14:50 - now if you're not sure if that's what
14:52 - you want then you can run brew cask info
14:55 - on that package and it'll show you more
14:57 - information about that so a lot of the
14:59 - brew commands are the same with brew
15:01 - cask so brew info and brew cask info now
15:05 - if you're still not sure then you can
15:07 - run brew cask home on a package and it
15:10 - will take you to the home page of that
15:11 - software so that you're sure it's what
15:13 - you expected so for example if I was to
15:16 - run brew cask home on that pycharm
15:20 - package if I run this then it's going to
15:23 - open up the pycharm home page for us
15:25 - here in the browser now like I said in
15:27 - the near future I'm going to release a
15:29 - video where I'll show you how I use
15:31 - scripts with brew cask to completely
15:33 - setup a new machine
15:35 - and install all kinds of different
15:36 - applications such as google chrome
15:38 - sublime text the fonts that alike
15:40 - Spotify and a few others okay so now
15:44 - let's look at a few other things that
15:46 - you can do with homebrew so I'm going to
15:48 - close down my browser here and go back
15:50 - to my terminal now sometimes with
15:51 - homebrew you're gonna want to install a
15:53 - package that is located in a different
15:55 - repository so far we've only installed
15:58 - software from the core homebrew
16:00 - repository but we can add others so to
16:03 - do this we can simply tap a repository
16:06 - and then install the packages so all of
16:08 - these are kind of homebrew terms you
16:10 - know tap things like that so for example
16:12 - to use the Heroku CLI on Mac it's
16:16 - easiest in my opinion to install this
16:18 - using homebrew but first we have to tap
16:21 - their repository so right now if I was
16:24 - to say brew search and I was to search
16:26 - for Heroku then once this search is
16:30 - complete we can see it says no formula
16:32 - or Cass found for Heroku then it spits
16:34 - out a little bit more information here
16:36 - but the main thing is that it didn't
16:38 - find any formula or cask for Heroku so
16:41 - in order to find that we first have to
16:43 - tap the repository so I'm going to say
16:45 - brew tap and the name of the Heroku
16:48 - repository is Heroku forge slash brew
16:51 - and just so you know I just found that
16:53 - repository name in the Roku
16:55 - documentation I don't actually memorize
16:58 - stuff like that ok so once we have that
17:00 - repository tapped now let me do that
17:02 - same search so I'll say brew search
17:04 - Heroku and now this should return the
17:09 - results from their repository so we can
17:11 - see here this is the repository named
17:13 - Heroku forward slash brew and these are
17:15 - the package names Heroku and Heroku note
17:18 - so if we wanted to install Heroku the
17:22 - Roku CLI I could say Heroku or brew
17:24 - install sorry brew install Heroku and if
17:28 - I run that then that's going to go out
17:30 - and install that Heroku CLI for us okay
17:34 - so now that Heroku installation
17:36 - completed so really that's all I wanted
17:38 - to show you as far as a broad overview
17:40 - to homebrew I think that covers about
17:42 - 99% of what most people would use
17:44 - homebrew for now if you no longer want
17:47 - homebrew on
17:48 - system then uninstalling it is pretty
17:50 - simple - they have a page on their
17:52 - website where they provide a script that
17:54 - does this for us and I have that open
17:56 - here in my browser so if I open my
17:58 - browser and go to their FAQ page I have
18:01 - this here at the top how do I uninstall
18:03 - homebrew and it's this script here it's
18:07 - just a another Ruby script just like
18:09 - they had a ruby script to install they
18:11 - also have one to uninstall so I can copy
18:14 - that and go back to my terminal and I
18:18 - can just paste that in and we can see
18:20 - here when we go to uninstall this it
18:21 - says are you sure you want to uninstall
18:23 - homebrew this will remove your installed
18:25 - packages as well so I'm gonna say yes
18:28 - now that's going to install all of the
18:31 - brew packages but I don't think that
18:33 - install uninstalls the brew cask
18:35 - packages so I think Firefox will remain
18:38 - but it will uninstall things like grep
18:42 - but that we installed okay so that
18:44 - installation or uninstall was successful
18:47 - now if we type brew again we can see
18:49 - that that no longer exists and I'd say
18:51 - that G grep no longer works either
18:53 - so it was uninstalled okay so I think
18:56 - that just going to do it for this video
18:58 - hopefully now you have a pretty good
18:59 - idea for how you can use homebrew on the
19:02 - Mac and can see why this is so useful
19:03 - like I said I'll be doing a video in the
19:06 - near future where I set up a new
19:07 - development machine from scratch and I
19:09 - use my own custom scripts to go out and
19:12 - pull down a lot of software at once that
19:14 - might take hours to do manually without
19:16 - something like homebrew so it not only
19:19 - adds a lot of nice functionality to our
19:21 - machines but it can also be a huge time
19:23 - saver but if anyone has any questions
19:25 - about will be covered in this video then
19:27 - feel free to ask in the comment section
19:28 - below and I'll do my best to answer
19:29 - those and if you enjoy these tutorials
19:31 - and would like to support them then
19:33 - there are several ways you can do that
19:34 - the easiest way is to simply like the
19:35 - video and give it a thumbs up and also
19:37 - it's a huge help to share these videos
19:38 - with anyone who you think would find
19:40 - them useful and if you have the means

Cleaned transcript:

hey there how's it going everybody in this video we're going to be learning how to install and use homebrew on the Mac operating system so homebrew is a package manager for Mac so you can kind of think of it like apt or yum for Linux systems or if you're more familiar with Python it then you can think of this as being the PIP of the Mac operating system now this is going to allow us to install software using the command line and a nice and easy to use way and I use this all the time for installing software or setting up new machines I actually just got a new MacBook the other day and I'm going to release a video soon after this one showing how I use homebrew to automate a large portion of the setup of a new development machine but in this video we're just going to learn the basics and how to use homebrew in general so let's go ahead and get started so first of all before we can install homebrew we need to have some command line tools installed and we can install these easily through Xcode so in an open terminal you can install these by saying Xcode select and then install now I'm gonna get an error here because I already have these installed it says command line tools already installed so I've already done that but you might need to do that if you haven't yet but once we have those installed we should be able to now install homebrew so right now I don't have this installed if I try to run the brew command I can see that I get an error and it says brew command not found so to install homebrew we can simply go to their website and I have that open here in my browser and right at the top of their home page they have the installation command so I'm going to copy that and we can simply paste that into our terminal so it's this command here it's a ruby command that's going to run this Ruby script to install so I'm going to open back up my terminal here and now I'm just going to paste in that command it's gonna run it automatically and now it's going to ask us to walk through this so I'm going to and we're also going to need to put in our password as well so I'm just going to let this install and I'm going to pick the video back up once this is complete okay so that installation completed we can see here that it says installation successful so if you didn't have any errors that homebrew should have been installed correctly so we can test this simply by running brew help and if that doesn't give us an error and it actually shows us some brew commands here then it means that that installation was successful okay so now let's go over a few things and see how we can use homebrew so first of all if you want to list all of the packages that you can install with homebrew then we can simply say brew search and we can see that there are a lot of packages listed here that we can install now if we want to see how many packages that is exactly then we could pipe that into the Linux word count command I'm not going to go into the details of Linux commands in this video or piping commands but if you wanted the total lines from that output you could simply say brew search and pipe that into word count and then L will count the number of lines so if I run that then that should display the number of packages that were displayed with that brew search command now if we wanted to narrow down those results and we don't want to look through all 4700 of those then we could pass in a string to brew search as well so let's say that I wanted to install Postgres and wanted to search for that package so to do that I could simply say brew search Postgres and when I run that it's going to go out and search those packages and we can see here that it returns a few results so most likely to install Postgres I would use that formula of Postgres SQL now we can see that there are two sections here one R of these is called formula and the other here is cask we're going to talk more about the differences between those in just a bit and see some examples of both but basically formula typically deal with commandline software and cask is an extension of homebrew that allows us to install mac OS native applications like google chrome and stuff like that and we'll see more of that in just a bit so that's how we can search packages using brew but you can also view this in the browser as well and I have this page pulled up here and I'll leave a link to these in the description section below as well so we can see in the browser here all of the packages available here as well along with a short description of each and you can also search within here in the browser so if I was to do something like Postgres then we can see that it pops up those same results and then you can get more detailed information about each package okay so now let's look at installing a package using homebrew okay so one package that I like to install with homebrew is called tree it's a nice simple program that prints out tree directory structures in the command line so if I was to try to do this right now then we can see it says that the tree command is not found so this isn't installed so to install this with using brew we can simply say brew install tree and that's going to go out and install that package and once that's finished I'm going to let this download finish here and once that's finished we should be able to now use that tree command so right now I'm in my home folder so I don't want to run tree here since it would show the tree structure of my entire home folder but instead let me CD to my desktop and I'll look at the tree structure of one of my projects there so I'm going to change directory into my desktop and here on my desktop I have my flask blog application from my flask series so I'm gonna run tree on that so I'll say tree and that's called flask blog so I'm going to run that and we can see that it shows a nice directory structure of that project here within our command line so I really like that program it's a nice way to get an overview of a project or a directory so that tree command is working nicely now that we installed it using homebrew so where does homebrew and actually install these packages now if I run the which command to see the path to tree if I say which tree then it looks like that this was installed in user local thin but that's actually just a symbolic link I can see that that's a symbolic link if I say LS la and now I'm going to just copy this line here and I'm going to list out that directory there and we can see that this L here says that this is a link so this is the link here and then it's going to this location so this is up one directory which would be user local and then it's in this cellar directory and then it installs it in there so that is where homebrew is installing these packages is within this user local cellar directory now if we want to see more information about an installed package then we can do that by using the info command so let me clear my screen here I want to say brew info of tree and that's going to give us a description and where and when it was installed and also some analytic data now if we look at the info for an uninstalled package then it will show us the dependencies and things like that so if I was to clear my screen here and say brew info node and node is not currently installed then we can see here that it says not installed and it also tells us what dependencies it's needs and which ones we already have the red X here means that none of these dependencies are currently installed and if we did have one of those dependencies installed then it would instead be a green checkmark ok so yeah that info command can give you some pretty useful information now to uninstall a package we can simply run the uninstall command so brew uninstall tree and that will go out and uninstall that tree command that we just installed earlier now one really interesting thing with homebrew is that we can use it to install new versions of certain tools that will overwrite max bsd version of the same tool now I'm not gonna go into a lot of details there but basically a lot of people like the Linux can new version of some tools a lot more than the default Mac BSD version so one of the example of that would be the grep command so if I look at the version of the default grep command within Mac then we can see that this says BSD grep so this is the BSD version of grep but if I look at the info for the grep package on home brew if I say brew info grep then we can see that this says this is new grep so that's the Linux canoe version of grip so does that mean that if we install grep using brew that it will overwrite our max default grep command well not really but we could do that if we wanted to if we look down here at the caveat section within this information then we can see that it says all commands have been installed with the prefix G if you need to use these commands with their normal names you can add the new bin directory to your path for your bash RC or in Mac's case sometimes your bash underscore profile so that means that the grep command is going to have a g prefix so it's going to be G grep so just to show you this let me actually install that so I'll say brew install grep and it's going to go out and install this and I will let this finish and when that finishes it shows us here at the end that same caveat that it displayed in the info that this actually has a prefix of G and how we could set the path if we didn't want that prefix so now we have grep installed but that's going to have a prefix of G so if it's do G grep version then we can see that that is good new grep but it did not overwrite my Mac version this is still BSD grip and again if you did want to replace the default version of grep instead of using G grep then you could do what they said and add that ganoub in directory to your path now personally I prefer the new version of tools and my day to day coding but I don't have them installed anymore now that I'm doing these tutorials I never want to have commands configured differently on my machine that might work in a certain way now that don't work for someone else who's falling along with a video so I would recommend these types of tools even though I no longer use them myself because I'm doing these videos okay so now let's look at how you to update packages so first of all to see what packages we currently have installed we can simply say brew list and we can see there that we have two packages the other package here was just a dependency for grep so if we wanted to update our packages none of these will need update since we just installed them but if we did want to update them it's a very similar process to something like apt on Linux so we would just simply say let me clear the screen here we could simply say brew update and that will fetch the newest version of all of the packages and then if we wanted to view the outdated packages we could say brew outdated and that would show us all of the packages that have an updated version available then to actually update those outdated packages then we would then say brew upgrade and run that so anyone familiar with Linux that should be a familiar process because it's how it's done on there as well now by default brew doesn't actually uninstall old versions of a package so over time you might accumulate old versions but to remove those you can simply run a command called brew clean up and that will go out and remove all of the older versions of those packages so that might be something that you want to put into a cron job to run occasionally or something like that now if you ever run into any problems with homebrew and need to check your system for potential problems then brew also comes with a selfdiagnosis tool that does this for you and that is called brew dr so if we run brew dr then that's going to diagnose your system and could let you know of any issues that it finds and this might print out a lot of warnings here but if I scroll up here at the top you can see that we have a lot of warnings but if I scroll up to the top then we can see it says please note that these warnings are just used to help homebrew maintainer zhh with debugging if you file an issue but if everything that you use homebrew for is working fine then please don't worry or file an issue just ignore it so home brews working fine for me I'm just going to ignore that output but if I did have any problems then that output there can help the maintainer z' possibly find what the issue is ok so now let's look at what I think is one of the coolest things about homebrew so so far we've installed some command line tools but we can actually install Mac applications as well and I usually use this when i want to write a script to easily set up a new machine and the way that we install this is with a homebrew extension called cask and it's super easy to use so we just need to say brew cask install instead of just brew install like we did before so for example let's say that we wanted to install phox we could just simply say brew cask install firefox and if i run that then that's gonna actually go out and install Firefox for us now this can take a second since it's installing a larger piece of software but I think it's a lot easier than going out to the Firefox website and going through their setup and then dragging and dropping the application to your Applications folder and all of that this is just one easy step to install this so I'm going to let this finish and then we'll pick up the video after this is done okay so we can see here that it says Firefox was successfully installed and it also moved that Firefox tap into my Applications folder now I uninstalled Firefox before this video began so if I run this then we can see that Firefox was actually reinstalled on my machine so that worked properly and sometimes when you're opening something for the first time you'll get this warning here I'm just going to go ahead and click open and this opened in the background here so we can see that that installation worked and that Firefox is working for us so that's good and you can use cast to install all kinds of different software brew cask also has a search command just like brew has so let's say that we wanted to install PyCharm so let's search for that so I'll say brew search and I'll search for PyCharm and when we do that sometimes this takes a second to get results back so we can see that we got a few results but the first result here is probably the one that we want now if you're not sure if that's what you want then you can run brew cask info on that package and it'll show you more information about that so a lot of the brew commands are the same with brew cask so brew info and brew cask info now if you're still not sure then you can run brew cask home on a package and it will take you to the home page of that software so that you're sure it's what you expected so for example if I was to run brew cask home on that pycharm package if I run this then it's going to open up the pycharm home page for us here in the browser now like I said in the near future I'm going to release a video where I'll show you how I use scripts with brew cask to completely setup a new machine and install all kinds of different applications such as google chrome sublime text the fonts that alike Spotify and a few others okay so now let's look at a few other things that you can do with homebrew so I'm going to close down my browser here and go back to my terminal now sometimes with homebrew you're gonna want to install a package that is located in a different repository so far we've only installed software from the core homebrew repository but we can add others so to do this we can simply tap a repository and then install the packages so all of these are kind of homebrew terms you know tap things like that so for example to use the Heroku CLI on Mac it's easiest in my opinion to install this using homebrew but first we have to tap their repository so right now if I was to say brew search and I was to search for Heroku then once this search is complete we can see it says no formula or Cass found for Heroku then it spits out a little bit more information here but the main thing is that it didn't find any formula or cask for Heroku so in order to find that we first have to tap the repository so I'm going to say brew tap and the name of the Heroku repository is Heroku forge slash brew and just so you know I just found that repository name in the Roku documentation I don't actually memorize stuff like that ok so once we have that repository tapped now let me do that same search so I'll say brew search Heroku and now this should return the results from their repository so we can see here this is the repository named Heroku forward slash brew and these are the package names Heroku and Heroku note so if we wanted to install Heroku the Roku CLI I could say Heroku or brew install sorry brew install Heroku and if I run that then that's going to go out and install that Heroku CLI for us okay so now that Heroku installation completed so really that's all I wanted to show you as far as a broad overview to homebrew I think that covers about 99% of what most people would use homebrew for now if you no longer want homebrew on system then uninstalling it is pretty simple they have a page on their website where they provide a script that does this for us and I have that open here in my browser so if I open my browser and go to their FAQ page I have this here at the top how do I uninstall homebrew and it's this script here it's just a another Ruby script just like they had a ruby script to install they also have one to uninstall so I can copy that and go back to my terminal and I can just paste that in and we can see here when we go to uninstall this it says are you sure you want to uninstall homebrew this will remove your installed packages as well so I'm gonna say yes now that's going to install all of the brew packages but I don't think that install uninstalls the brew cask packages so I think Firefox will remain but it will uninstall things like grep but that we installed okay so that installation or uninstall was successful now if we type brew again we can see that that no longer exists and I'd say that G grep no longer works either so it was uninstalled okay so I think that just going to do it for this video hopefully now you have a pretty good idea for how you can use homebrew on the Mac and can see why this is so useful like I said I'll be doing a video in the near future where I set up a new development machine from scratch and I use my own custom scripts to go out and pull down a lot of software at once that might take hours to do manually without something like homebrew so it not only adds a lot of nice functionality to our machines but it can also be a huge time saver but if anyone has any questions about will be covered in this video then feel free to ask in the comment section below and I'll do my best to answer those and if you enjoy these tutorials and would like to support them then there are several ways you can do that the easiest way is to simply like the video and give it a thumbs up and also it's a huge help to share these videos with anyone who you think would find them useful and if you have the means you can contribute through patreon and there's a link to that page in the
