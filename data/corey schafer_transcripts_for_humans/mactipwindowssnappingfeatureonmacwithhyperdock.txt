00:00 - hey what's going on guys I wanted to
00:02 - make a quick video about an app that
00:05 - I've been using a lot lately whenever
00:07 - I'm at work I work a lot on a Windows
00:10 - machine and then whenever I get home
00:11 - I'll work on my Mac and there's actually
00:14 - a couple of features from Windows I find
00:16 - myself missing whenever I'm programming
00:19 - on the Mac mostly it's the windows
00:23 - snapping feature and that's where this
00:26 - application comes in it's called hyper
00:29 - dock that I found on the on the App
00:33 - Store you can once you download it you
00:36 - can come in here and change some
00:39 - settings around and tweak it to how you
00:42 - like it but let me go ahead and show you
00:44 - what it does here so normally if I've
00:50 - got a couple windows open here and I've
00:52 - got some code over here and a test
00:55 - website over here now I like to have my
00:59 - code and my website taken up equal sides
01:02 - of screen just fifty-fifty and normally
01:06 - you'd have to come in here and manually
01:09 - adjust these every time that you want to
01:12 - do that but with the hyper dock it
01:15 - brings that window snapping
01:16 - functionality from Windows to where I
01:19 - can just take this window and drag it
01:21 - all the way over to the right and then
01:23 - it snaps and then I can take this and
01:26 - drag it all the way over to the left and
01:28 - then it snaps into place
01:30 - so that's really nice if I take it up to
01:33 - the top it will maximize it and there's
01:36 - also keyboard shortcuts for this too so
01:38 - if you hit the command key and the left
01:43 - arrow then it goes to the left and then
01:46 - command key right arrow takes it out to
01:48 - where it was normally and then if I do
01:51 - right again then it goes you can see
01:53 - right side of the screen so it's a
01:56 - really quick way to move windows around
01:58 - on your screen
02:00 - and you can do really quick layouts with
02:04 - this say I want to say I wanted the you
02:08 - can also go to the corners so if I
02:10 - wanted this website
02:12 - you take up the top half of the screen I
02:15 - could go up here to this top corner and
02:18 - then stretch this over and then if I
02:21 - wanted my javascript file to be at the
02:26 - bottom right I could put that down here
02:28 - and if I wanted the HTML file I could
02:31 - put that down in the bottom left and
02:33 - then I can see everything and I could go
02:39 - ahead and make changes to the website
02:41 - and see them in real time so you can
02:46 - pretty much lay that out any way that
02:48 - you want to do it and it's just really
02:51 - nice to be able to do that quickly
02:53 - instead of constantly manually dragging
02:56 - those around and like I said I usually
02:58 - just go with the 50/50 but this that's
03:02 - not the only functionality that this app
03:03 - has it also has the ability to let me go
03:07 - ahead and drag these over here you'll
03:12 - see I also have some windows open up in
03:14 - the background here and those are in
03:16 - Google Chrome if on my dock whenever you
03:19 - scroll over the icon and the dock it
03:23 - actually gives you a preview of all the
03:25 - windows that are open so instead of
03:26 - moving windows around to see what's in
03:29 - the back I can just scroll over these
03:30 - and it'll show me a little preview of
03:33 - each one so if I want to go to this one
03:36 - here I can just click on that and it
03:38 - brings it to the front you can also
03:39 - close windows down from this little
03:42 - screen here so if I scroll over this
03:44 - Google tab here and then just click this
03:47 - X then it closes it down and then you
03:49 - can also add windows by clicking this
03:52 - little plus button so that's a whole lot
03:56 - better than then you know moving windows
04:00 - around on your desktop trying to find
04:02 - trying to find where everything is
04:06 - another nice feature I like is whenever
04:10 - you scroll over your calendar it will
04:16 - show your events that are coming up yeah
04:20 - whenever you scroll through your
04:21 - calendar it will show your events that
04:23 - are coming up and also if you scroll
04:25 - over your music applications like iTunes
04:29 - or Spotify then instead of maximizing
04:31 - these to play music you can just scroll
04:34 - over top of them and come up here and
04:36 - hit play and you know you can switch
04:40 - through these and you can also do that
04:43 - with iTunes so I can play a song then I
04:46 - can switch the next one all from here so
04:51 - it's really nice that it you know
04:55 - everything that I like more about
04:57 - windows this app brings it all over to
05:00 - the Mac and I think the application was
05:04 - around ten dollars but I get a ton of
05:07 - use out of it and I like it a whole lot
05:10 - so I just wanted to share it with you
05:11 - guys so yeah check it out and thanks for
05:15 - watching
