00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video I want to talk about some big
00:02 - announcements and some updates and also
00:05 - go over some future plans so the first
00:07 - thing I wanted to talk about some of you
00:09 - may know about this and some of you may
00:10 - not but a couple months ago it's
00:12 - actually able to quit my previous
00:14 - full-time job and now I'm able to focus
00:16 - on doing videos and tutorials full-time
00:18 - now so first of all I just want to give
00:20 - a big thanks to all of you because
00:22 - there's no way I'd be able to do this
00:24 - full-time if it wasn't for the people
00:25 - who have subscribed to the channel and
00:27 - supported the channel over the years and
00:29 - also given me such good feedback along
00:32 - the way now I've been doing these videos
00:33 - for about four years now and honestly
00:35 - it's not something I ever thought I
00:36 - would be able to do full-time you know I
00:39 - was looking back at my old stats the
00:40 - other day from you know 2014-2015 and I
00:44 - think after my first 75 videos I was
00:47 - looking at my earnings and I think I was
00:48 - making less than a dollar a day after my
00:50 - first 75 videos so not even enough to
00:52 - buy a cup of coffee on let alone enough
00:54 - to live on
00:55 - but then in 2016 2017 I started seeing
00:59 - some more subscribers and views come in
01:01 - I was able to buy some better equipment
01:03 - and record better videos and now it's
01:06 - you know four years later I'm to the
01:08 - point where I'm able to do this
01:09 - full-time
01:09 - and speaking of subscribers we actually
01:12 - recently went above 100 thousand
01:13 - subscribers for the channel now I think
01:15 - we actually hit a hundred thousand back
01:17 - in March and now we're actually closer
01:19 - to 150 thousand or something like that
01:21 - but I just recently got my silver play
01:23 - button in the mail and I wanted to share
01:25 - it with you all so this is the silver
01:27 - play button here and this has been a big
01:30 - goal of mine ever since I started making
01:31 - these videos so again I just wanted to
01:34 - thank all of you all because it really
01:35 - means a lot to me that there are so many
01:37 - people out there who have found these
01:38 - videos helpful and have learned from
01:40 - these videos and also take you know have
01:43 - taken time over the years to be active
01:45 - in the comments section you know getting
01:47 - up each morning and reading through the
01:48 - comments is one of my favorite parts of
01:50 - the day because I love hearing stories
01:53 - from you all about you know some people
01:55 - tell me that the videos have helped them
01:57 - through their college courses some
01:58 - people have said that it's helped them
02:00 - land their first job and things like
02:01 - that and reading comments like that
02:03 - really means a lot to me so I just
02:06 - wanted to thank all of you all again so
02:08 - I appreciate that okay so with that
02:10 - stuff out of the way I'd like to take
02:12 - the rest of the video and talk
02:13 - what we can expect now that this is
02:15 - going to be a full-time thing so first
02:17 - of all you're gonna see a lot more
02:19 - larger courses from me now so I have
02:21 - time to actually spend working on larger
02:24 - courses so for example I just released a
02:26 - 12-part flash course recently and I
02:29 - think that was over eight hours of
02:31 - content all together so you're gonna see
02:34 - more things like that now that I have
02:35 - the time because before it was just too
02:38 - hard to work on a large course because I
02:41 - was only able to work on these videos on
02:43 - the weekends and it was hard to keep the
02:45 - continuity in large courses like that
02:47 - over the weekends because you forgot
02:48 - where you left off and it was hard to
02:51 - pick things back up and things like that
02:52 - so now it makes it so much easier being
02:54 - able to do this on a daily basis now one
02:57 - big mistake that I made whenever I first
02:58 - went full-time was that I saw all of
03:01 - this free time that I had to work on
03:02 - these larger courses and I dog directly
03:05 - into working on a large course I started
03:06 - directly working on that Flass course
03:08 - but what I should have done in hindsight
03:10 - and what I'm going to do from here on
03:12 - out is I'm going to also work on some
03:14 - smaller videos so that I have a queue of
03:17 - videos built up that I can release try
03:19 - to release on a weekly basis so that
03:21 - there's no not so much time between
03:23 - video releases because it took me about
03:26 - a month of research and building that
03:28 - Flast blog before I got that out and a
03:31 - lot of people were kind of wondering
03:33 - where I was for that month so now I'm
03:35 - gonna try to have some videos that I can
03:37 - release on a weekly to bi-weekly basis
03:39 - while I'm working on those big courses
03:41 - so right now I'm working on a django
03:43 - course but I'm also going to record some
03:45 - smaller videos in between so that we
03:47 - have some content coming out now I'd
03:49 - also like to talk about funding and how
03:51 - I'm going to be able to afford to do
03:52 - this now that I'm doing this full-time
03:53 - so currently the majority of my income
03:56 - is coming from YouTube ads and that is
03:59 - just based on the total number of views
04:00 - that I get each month so I think that
04:02 - number is I think 95% of my revenue
04:05 - right now is coming from YouTube ads but
04:07 - ideally I would love to get to the point
04:09 - where the majority of my income is
04:11 - coming through fan funded sites like
04:12 - patreon and that way I wouldn't have to
04:14 - worry as much about YouTube's algorithms
04:16 - or advertisers or anything like that
04:19 - because right now any small change sets
04:22 - to the platform that they make it could
04:23 - drastically change how my videos are
04:25 - discovered or
04:27 - ad rates or anything like that so it's
04:29 - not exactly the most stable form of
04:31 - income I think that fan funding from
04:33 - people who really feel like they could
04:35 - support the videos would be much more
04:37 - stable in the long run now one option
04:39 - that a lot of people have mentioned to
04:40 - me is that I could start creating paid
04:42 - courses but that's one thing that I'm
04:43 - not gonna do because I don't want to
04:45 - exclude anybody who can't pay for a
04:47 - course from getting access to my content
04:49 - like I said before there are a lot of
04:52 - students who watch these videos or
04:53 - people who are struggling to find a new
04:55 - job and there's simply people who can't
04:58 - afford to pay for a course right now so
05:00 - I don't want to exclude those people
05:01 - from being able to get access to this
05:03 - kind of educational content so I'm just
05:06 - hoping that by continuing to release
05:07 - everything for free and putting out good
05:09 - content that that'll bring in people who
05:11 - want to support what I'm doing and will
05:12 - contribute if they can so either a
05:14 - monthly support through something like
05:15 - patreon or a one-time contribution
05:17 - through PayPal even YouTube has added a
05:21 - sponsor button below each video where
05:23 - you can directly support creators
05:24 - through YouTube itself okay so lastly I
05:27 - would like to talk to you about sponsors
05:28 - so now that I'm doing this full-time
05:30 - you're occasionally going to see a
05:32 - sponsor here and there but I'm very
05:34 - picky when it comes to sponsors so I get
05:36 - hundreds of emails from people who want
05:38 - me to promote their product or their
05:39 - website or something like that but I'm
05:42 - not going to pitch anything to you all
05:44 - unless it is something that I actually
05:45 - believe in and something that I would
05:47 - actually use myself and at this point
05:49 - I've only found one sponsor that has met
05:51 - that criteria and that is brilliant Borg
05:53 - so I'm extremely excited that brilliant
05:55 - is going to sponsor some videos because
05:57 - I use their site even before they
05:59 - contacted me brilliant is a
06:01 - problem-solving website that helps you
06:03 - understand underlying concepts by
06:05 - actively working through guided lessons
06:07 - they have computer science courses
06:08 - ranging from algorithms and data
06:10 - structures to machine learning and
06:11 - neural networks they even have a coding
06:13 - environment built into their website so
06:15 - that you can run code directly in the
06:17 - browser and that's a great way to
06:18 - complement watching my tutorials because
06:20 - you can apply what you've learned in
06:21 - their active problem-solving environment
06:23 - and that helps to solidify that
06:25 - knowledge there are guided lessons will
06:26 - challenge you but you also have the
06:28 - ability to get hints or even solutions
06:30 - if you need them it's really tailored
06:31 - towards understanding that material so
06:33 - they're computer science material is
06:35 - fantastic and I really like what they're
06:36 - doing they also have plenty of courses
06:39 - depending on what
06:40 - most interested in so they have courses
06:42 - in different fields of mathematics or
06:44 - astronomy solar energy computational
06:47 - biology and all kinds of other great
06:49 - content so to support my channel and
06:51 - learn more about brilliant you can go to
06:52 - brilliant org ford slash CMS to sign up
06:56 - for free and also the first 200 people
06:58 - that go to that link will get 20% off
07:00 - the annual premium subscription and you
07:02 - can find that link in the description
07:04 - section below and again that's brilliant
07:06 - org /c m/s okay so I think that it's
07:11 - going to do it for this video I guess I
07:13 - should also acknowledge the fact this is
07:15 - the first time I've done a video like
07:16 - this where I'm talking directly to the
07:18 - camera so let me know what you all think
07:20 - about this I don't plan on doing a lot
07:22 - of these I'm going to still mainly stick
07:25 - to tutorials but I do have some video
07:27 - ideas that I have written down that kind
07:29 - of make more sense to have a
07:30 - conversation style like this so things
07:33 - like you know career advice and stuff
07:35 - like that it doesn't make as much sense
07:37 - just to look at my screen the whole time
07:39 - while I'm talking so anyways let me know
07:42 - what you think about this style of video
07:44 - but as usual if you enjoy these videos
07:47 - and would like to support them then
07:49 - there are several ways you can do that
07:50 - the easiest way is to simply like the
07:52 - video and give it a thumbs up and also
07:53 - it's a huge help to share these videos
07:54 - with anyone who you think would find
07:56 - them useful and if you have the means
07:57 - you can contribute through patreon and
07:59 - there's a link to that page in the
08:00 - description section below be sure to
08:02 - subscribe for future videos and thank
08:03 - you all for watching
08:15 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey there how's it going everybody in this video I want to talk about some big announcements and some updates and also go over some future plans so the first thing I wanted to talk about some of you may know about this and some of you may not but a couple months ago it's actually able to quit my previous fulltime job and now I'm able to focus on doing videos and tutorials fulltime now so first of
