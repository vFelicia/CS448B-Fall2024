00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video we will look at how to update and
00:04 - delete records from our database using
00:07 - the update and delete commands now I'm
00:09 - putting both of these into one video
00:11 - because they are very similar concepts
00:14 - now before we update or delete any
00:17 - records in our database it's usually a
00:19 - good idea to first run a select
00:21 - statement on the values so that we know
00:24 - that we're acting upon the correct data
00:26 - but first let's look at an extremely
00:29 - simple example with this test table here
00:33 - so that we can see what happens
00:35 - if we update or delete values without
00:37 - using a where clause to filter which
00:40 - records we want so if we look at this
00:42 - test table here it's a very simple table
00:44 - that just has eight records in it and
00:46 - all of the location values here are null
00:49 - so let's update this to where all of the
00:53 - location values are set to the string
00:55 - unknown so to do this we can run the
00:58 - update statement so I'm going to go over
01:00 - here to write my query and I'm going to
01:02 - say update test table and then I'm going
01:05 - to do set location equal to and then the
01:10 - string unknown so if I run this query
01:14 - and then I go back over here to the
01:17 - table and reload the data you can see
01:20 - that now all of the location values in
01:22 - the entire table have been set to
01:24 - unknown now the reason that updated all
01:27 - of those values is because in our query
01:29 - we didn't have a where clause so it's
01:31 - just going to do all of the records so
01:33 - now let's say that we want to delete all
01:35 - of the records from this table so we can
01:37 - do this with the delete statement and if
01:40 - we want to delete everything then it's
01:41 - just as easy as doing a delete from test
01:47 - table so if I run this and then I go
01:49 - back over here to the content and reload
01:51 - the data you can see that our table is
01:54 - completely empty it deleted all of the
01:55 - records that we had and again the reason
01:58 - that it did that is because we don't
02:00 - have a where clause here so it's just
02:01 - going to go and delete everything now
02:03 - more commonly you're going to use these
02:06 - commands to update or delete specific
02:09 - records and not all of them at once
02:12 - so this is where
02:13 - I said that it's beneficial to first run
02:16 - a select statement for the records that
02:18 - you want to update or delete and that
02:20 - way you know what you're acting upon is
02:23 - the correct data so let's look at all of
02:26 - the records from this people table by
02:29 - running the query select star from
02:33 - people and if we run this then we have
02:37 - all of our records back so now let's say
02:40 - that this record right here number 14
02:42 - that we want to set Jane Smith's
02:45 - occupation from student to programmer so
02:49 - first let's write a select statement to
02:51 - grab that record so that we're sure that
02:53 - we're getting the correct one so once
02:55 - the like statement that could get that
02:56 - record we could do a select from people
02:59 - where first-name is equal to Jane and
03:04 - lastname is equal to Smith now if I run
03:10 - this query and you can see that we only
03:12 - get back to one result which is good
03:14 - because that's the one that we want to
03:16 - update now we could have also done a
03:19 - where the ID is equal to 14 if we were
03:22 - worried about there being multiple Jane
03:24 - Smith's but this is good for our purpose
03:28 - here so now let's replace this select
03:31 - with our update and we're going to leave
03:33 - the where clause exactly like it is so
03:35 - let's do an update people and then we
03:39 - will do set occupation equal to
03:43 - programmer and let me capitalize this so
03:47 - now if I run this query and now it
03:51 - doesn't look like anything happened but
03:52 - now if I do the select star from people
03:56 - again and run this query you can see now
03:59 - if we look at Jane Smith down here at
04:02 - number 14 now her occupation is set to
04:05 - programmer so now let me show you why
04:07 - it's important to run the select
04:09 - statement before updating or deleting
04:11 - records so in this example let's say
04:13 - that we want to delete all of the people
04:16 - with the occupation scientists who are
04:19 - younger than the age of 58 so let's let
04:22 - write a select statement that we think
04:25 - will do this but
04:27 - we accidentally make a small mistake so
04:29 - let's do select star from people where
04:33 - occupation is equal to scientist and let
04:39 - me fix this here and now when we do our
04:42 - age less than 58
04:44 - let's accidentally type in or age less
04:48 - than 58 so notice when I run this query
04:51 - we get back a lot of results here and
04:53 - it's a lot more than we planned and it's
04:56 - because we meant to say that we wanted
04:58 - scientists and their age is less than 58
05:02 - not or so now if we run it then we can
05:05 - see that we only get one result now if I
05:08 - had run the delete statement with that
05:10 - bad where clause without first running
05:13 - the check using the Select statement
05:15 - then I would have accidentally deleted
05:18 - all of those records that were returned
05:20 - with that first select statement that I
05:21 - didn't mean to delete so now that we
05:24 - have selected this record and we know
05:26 - that we're acting upon the correct data
05:28 - then now if I want to delete this record
05:31 - then I can just do a delete from people
05:33 - and I could leave the where clause
05:35 - exactly as it is so now if I run this
05:38 - query and then do a select store from
05:43 - people and run this if we look through
05:46 - all of this data then we'll notice that
05:48 - the Neil Tyson record that we had in
05:53 - there has been deleted and it no longer
05:55 - exists in our table so that about does
05:57 - it for this video hopefully that cleared
05:59 - up some different ways in which you can
06:01 - use the update and delete statements if
06:03 - you do have any questions just ask in

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody how's it going in this video we will look at how to update and delete records from our database using the update and delete commands now I'm putting both of these into one video because they are very similar concepts now before we update or delete any records in our database it's usually a good idea to first run a select statement on the values so that we know that we're acting upon the correct data but first let's look at an extremely simple example with this test table here so that we can see what happens if we update or delete values without using a where clause to filter

the location values are set to the string unknown so to do this we can run the update statement so I'm going to go over here to write my query and I'm going to say update test table and then I'm going to do set location equal to and then the string unknown so if I run this query and then I go back over here to the table and reload the data you can see that now all of the location values in the entire table have been set to unknown now the reason that updated all of those values is because in our query we didn't have a where clause so it's just going to do all of the records so now let's say that we want to delete all of the records from this table so we can do this with the delete statement and if we want to delete everything then it's just as easy as doing a delete from test table so if
