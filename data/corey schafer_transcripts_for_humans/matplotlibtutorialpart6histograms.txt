00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be learning
00:02 - how to plot histograms so histograms are
00:05 - great for visualizing the distribution
00:07 - of data where the data falls within
00:09 - certain boundaries it's a lot like a bar
00:11 - graph but a histogram groups the data up
00:13 - into bins instead of plotting each
00:16 - individual value so the best way to see
00:18 - what this looks like is to just take a
00:19 - look at some examples now I would like
00:22 - to mention that we do have a sponsor for
00:23 - the series of videos and that is
00:25 - brilliant dot work so I really want to
00:27 - thank brilliant we're sponsoring this
00:28 - series and it would be great if you all
00:30 - could check them out using the link in
00:31 - the description section below and
00:33 - support the sponsors and I'll talk more
00:34 - about their services and just a bit so
00:37 - with that said let's go ahead and get
00:38 - started so I have a little starting code
00:40 - here that you might recognize if you're
00:42 - continuing from previous videos but if
00:44 - you're not then let me give a quick
00:46 - overview of the code here and what's
00:48 - what's going on ok so up here at the top
00:50 - of the code I am importing pandas I'm
00:52 - also importing pipe lot from matplotlib
00:55 - I'm using the 538 style
00:58 - 4 just to make our plots look a little
01:01 - nicer and here is the data that I'm
01:04 - going to be using for this video right
01:06 - now I just have a list of ages here
01:07 - between 18 and 55 I here's some data
01:10 - that I have commented out in a CSV file
01:12 - and we'll look at this once we get
01:14 - further along in the video and see how
01:16 - to plot out more data than just this
01:18 - small list ok so down here at the bottom
01:21 - we are also creating a title for our
01:23 - plot we have X and y axis labels we have
01:27 - a tight layout which just gives our plot
01:31 - some padding and also we are doing plot
01:34 - dot show which will actually show our
01:35 - plot now as usual if you'd like to
01:37 - follow along then I will have this code
01:39 - available on my github and there's a
01:41 - link to that and it's description
01:42 - section below if you want to go there
01:44 - and copy and paste this into your editor
01:46 - so that you can follow along with this
01:47 - exact data and I'm also going to have
01:49 - the data CSV file that I'm using in this
01:52 - video as well ok so like I was saying
01:54 - we're first gonna look at how to do this
01:55 - using this list of data directly here in
01:59 - the Python script and then we'll look at
02:01 - a real word example with data that I'll
02:03 - load in from a CSV file so first let's
02:06 - look at this small list of sample data
02:08 - so let's pretend that we took a survey
02:10 - and we track the ages of all the people
02:13 - who respond
02:13 - now it might be useful to plot those
02:15 - ages to get an idea of which age groups
02:18 - are in our sample size so how should we
02:21 - actually plot these well off the top of
02:23 - your head you might think that a bar
02:24 - chart would be a good idea for this but
02:27 - if you think about it we possibly have
02:29 - up to a hundred different possible ages
02:32 - maybe even more so if you plot it out
02:35 - how many responses we got from each age
02:37 - then that would mean you'd have almost a
02:39 - hundred different columns which
02:41 - definitely isn't useful
02:42 - so this is where histograms come in
02:44 - histograms allow us to create bins for
02:47 - our data and plot how many values fall
02:50 - into those bins so to see this let's
02:53 - create a histogram of this list of ages
02:55 - that we have here so to do this I can
02:58 - simply say BLT dot hist and we will plot
03:03 - out those ages now if I ran this now
03:07 - then it would give us a plot but really
03:10 - we wouldn't know what bins it's actually
03:12 - using so I always like to pass those in
03:14 - manually and explicitly so that people
03:17 - know what those bins are so when we
03:19 - specify bins we can either pass in an
03:22 - integer or a list of values if we pass
03:25 - in an integer then it will just may make
03:28 - that number of bins and divide our data
03:30 - into those accordingly so for example if
03:33 - I was to say bins is equal to 5 then
03:36 - this will divide all of these ages up
03:39 - into 5 different bins and then tell us
03:41 - how many people fell into those age
03:43 - ranges so if we run this then we can see
03:47 - that we get a pretty simple histogram
03:49 - here and what this is is a distribution
03:52 - here now I personally find it a bit
03:54 - difficult to read these sometimes if we
03:56 - don't have edge colors for each bin
03:58 - because they all just kind of run
04:00 - together here so I don't know exactly
04:02 - how many bins there are here and here
04:05 - I'm a guessing since we have five bins
04:06 - it's two bins here and three bins here
04:08 - but let's add in some edge color so
04:10 - that's more clear so we can add those in
04:13 - by going back to our plot here and I'm
04:15 - just going to pass that as an argument
04:17 - so edge color is equal to I'll just say
04:20 - black so now let's run this and now we
04:23 - can see those bins a bit more clearly so
04:26 - let me
04:27 - make this a little larger and also to
04:29 - where you can see the ages up here at
04:31 - the top and let me explain what this is
04:33 - actually doing so we said that we wanted
04:35 - our data plotted on a histogram and we
04:38 - wanted that broken up into five
04:39 - different bins so it calculated those
04:42 - ages for us so this looks like it's
04:44 - between let's see 18 and like 26 maybe
04:48 - and then 26 to 33 and so on but what
04:53 - this is telling us here is that there
04:55 - are four people in our ages here that
04:58 - fall between 18 to 26 and there are four
05:02 - people that fall between 26 to 33 and so
05:05 - on and then we just have one person in
05:08 - these higher age ranges for each of
05:10 - those bins so if you pass in an integer
05:12 - for our bins then that's what we get but
05:15 - we can also pass in our own list of
05:17 - values and those values will be the bins
05:20 - and I like passing in a list of bins for
05:22 - this kind of data because you have more
05:24 - control over the exact values so for
05:26 - example let's say that I wanted to plot
05:28 - the ages broken up into groups of ten
05:31 - year differences so I could say right
05:34 - here above my plot I'm gonna say bins is
05:37 - equal to and I'm just going to say that
05:40 - we want to bend for 10 20 30 40 50 and
05:44 - 60 and now instead of passing in that we
05:48 - want 5 bins I want to say that I want to
05:51 - use this list as my bins so now if I run
05:54 - this then we can see that we still get
05:57 - five different bins here but that's only
06:01 - because we have six values here in our
06:04 - list so it starts at 10 and then 10 to
06:07 - 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 40 to 50 and 50 to
06:11 - 60 so that is five bins total so if I
06:14 - open this back up now the reason I like
06:17 - using my own bins for this kind of data
06:19 - is because now it doesn't have to try to
06:22 - guess where I want these broken up so we
06:25 - can see that now we have from 10 to 20
06:28 - it's a lot easier to read we don't have
06:29 - to guess it's like 26 or something like
06:31 - that so we're saying from 10 to 22
06:34 - people and our ages list fell into that
06:36 - bin there were 4 people from 20 to 30
06:40 - three from 30 to 40 one from 40 to 50
06:43 - and one from 50 to 60 so that's how you
06:45 - plot and read a histogram and we can
06:48 - even exclude some data if we don't want
06:51 - to add those ranges to our bins so for
06:54 - example let's say that we didn't want to
06:57 - include the ages between 10 to 20 in my
07:00 - results well to do that we can just
07:02 - simply remove 10 from the bin and now 20
07:06 - will be that leftmost value so now if we
07:09 - run this then now we can see that it's
07:12 - not even plotting out the ages from 10
07:15 - to 20 there so this 19 and 20 don't even
07:17 - show up in our results here so this is
07:20 - now just giving us our results for the
07:22 - people who fell into these age ranges
07:24 - between 20 and 60 okay so now that we've
07:27 - looked at this small example now let's
07:29 - look at a real world example looking at
07:32 - some real data so let me uncomment what
07:35 - I've got here let me remove ages here so
07:40 - I'm just going to remove that data that
07:43 - is directly in our Python script now I'm
07:46 - going to uncomment out the data that I
07:47 - had down here let me cut that out and
07:50 - paste it here above our bins and our
07:55 - plot okay so I'm loading in this data is
07:58 - V file and I'm using this Panda stop
08:01 - read CSV method to do this now we've
08:03 - done this a few times so far in the
08:05 - series but if this is your first video
08:07 - that you are watching in the series then
08:08 - let me explain this really quick so we
08:11 - are loading in this data CSV so what
08:14 - this does is it goes to this see data
08:16 - CSV file here so let me explain what
08:19 - this survey data is so we have these
08:22 - responder IDs and this is just an ID for
08:24 - each person who responded to the survey
08:26 - so this is one person here this is
08:29 - another person here another person here
08:30 - and then our age column here is just the
08:33 - age for the people who responded to this
08:35 - survey so this person was 14 this person
08:37 - was nineteen twenty eight twenty two and
08:39 - so on so back here we have our IDs
08:43 - variable and we're setting that equal to
08:45 - data and then we are passing in this
08:48 - responder ID key so what that does is it
08:51 - sets those IDs equal to all of
08:53 - these IDs here that are in this
08:55 - responder ID column and here we're
08:58 - saying ages is equal to data age and
09:00 - that is setting that ages variable
09:03 - they're equal to this entire column here
09:05 - for our ages and the data that I'm using
09:08 - here are the responses from the 2019
09:11 - stackoverflow developer survey so this
09:14 - is actually real data for people who
09:16 - answered that survey so we have let's
09:18 - see over 79,000 responses here in this
09:23 - data csv file okay so let's plot a
09:26 - histogram of the ages for this data set
09:28 - and see what age ranges most people fall
09:31 - into who answered this survey so I'm
09:33 - going to expand the bins here a bit and
09:36 - I'm gonna say 10 20 30 40 50 60 we'll
09:40 - also cover 70 80 whoops 80 90 and let's
09:45 - also put in a hundred there now since we
09:47 - called this ages variable here the same
09:49 - thing that we had before we don't even
09:51 - need to change our histogram plot
09:53 - because that is still just ages there so
09:56 - now I should be able to run this and get
09:58 - some real data here from this or some
10:01 - results here from that data so we can
10:04 - see here that based on this plot that
10:06 - almost 40,000 of the respondents were
10:09 - between the ages of 20 and 30 and almost
10:13 - 25 thousand were between the ages of 30
10:16 - and 40 now it might not look like we
10:19 - have data for 70 to 80 and 80 to 90 but
10:23 - it's likely because there just weren't
10:25 - many responses with those ages and
10:27 - compared to 40,000 responses for the 20
10:30 - to 30 group it's just too small to show
10:32 - up but I bet if I was to zoom in on
10:35 - these values here then we will start to
10:37 - see something okay so here's 70 to 80 if
10:40 - i zoom in here then we can see 80 to 83
10:43 - so there are some responses there but
10:46 - they're just being dwarfed by these
10:48 - numbers over here now when you have
10:50 - certain values that are a lot more than
10:51 - your other values then you can plot this
10:54 - on a logarithmic scale to montón to not
10:57 - make this look so extreme so to do this
10:59 - we can add an argument of log equals
11:03 - true to our plot so within our hist
11:06 - method
11:07 - I'm just gonna say log is equal to true
11:10 - and now if I run this then this is
11:13 - plotting this on a logarithmic scale and
11:15 - we can see that now we do have that data
11:18 - visible for 70 to 80 80 to 90 and 90 to
11:21 - 100 so we actually had more people who
11:24 - responded to the survey that they were
11:26 - between the ages of 90 to 100 than the
11:29 - people who were between 80 and 90 so I
11:31 - think that's kind of interesting there
11:33 - now sometimes you might find it useful
11:36 - to add some additional information
11:38 - within these plots as well so for
11:41 - example let's just leave the histogram
11:43 - how we have it for now but let's say
11:46 - that we want to plot a vertical line
11:47 - where the median age of all the
11:50 - respondents is and I've got this
11:52 - commented out down here at the bottom
11:55 - here so let me uncomment out this median
11:58 - age and also I'm going to uncomment this
12:00 - color and this legend as well so I went
12:03 - through and I calculated the median age
12:05 - of all of the respondents and it was 29
12:08 - years old so now let's plot a vertical
12:11 - line on our existing plot with that age
12:14 - so to do that just above our legend here
12:18 - I'm going to say PLT dot ax V line so
12:23 - I'm pretty sure that is stands for axis
12:25 - vertical line and we want that line to
12:28 - be plotted at the median age and now
12:32 - let's also I want to add in a color here
12:35 - and the custom color I'm going to add as
12:38 - this I think this is just a red color
12:40 - that I grabbed and also let's put in a
12:42 - label so that we know what this line
12:44 - represents and I'm just going to say age
12:46 - median so now let's run this and now we
12:50 - can see that within our histogram we now
12:52 - have this vertical line here which is
12:55 - the age median so this plot tells us a
12:58 - lot of things it tells us how many
13:00 - people are falling within which age
13:02 - groups who answered the survey and also
13:05 - where the median is for those survey
13:07 - results and if you think that this line
13:09 - is a little bit thick and kind of
13:10 - obstructing the data anyway then you can
13:12 - play around with how this looks so for
13:15 - example if you wanted to change the
13:16 - thickness there instead we could say
13:18 - line width is
13:19 - equal to two if I run that then that's a
13:23 - little thinner there so that's basically
13:26 - what these histogram plots are used for
13:29 - we can use these for dropping our data
13:32 - into these different bins and see how
13:35 - many values fall into these certain bins
13:37 - so that's what you would use a histogram
13:38 - for okay so we are just about finished
13:40 - up here but before we end I'd like to
13:43 - mention the sponsor of this video and
13:44 - that is brilliant org brilliant is a
13:47 - problem-solving website that helps you
13:49 - understand underlying concepts by
13:51 - actively working through guided lessons
13:53 - they have computer science courses
13:54 - ranging from algorithms and data
13:56 - structures to machine learning and
13:58 - neural networks they even have a coding
13:59 - environment built into their website so
14:01 - that you can run code directly in the
14:03 - browser and that's a great way to
14:04 - complement watching my tutorials because
14:06 - you can apply what you've learned and
14:08 - their active problem-solving environment
14:09 - and that helps to solidify that
14:11 - knowledge there are guided lessons will
14:13 - challenge you but you also have the
14:14 - ability to get hints or even solutions
14:16 - if you need them it's really tailored
14:18 - towards understanding that material so
14:19 - they're computer science material is
14:21 - fantastic and I really like what they're
14:23 - doing they also have plenty of courses
14:25 - depending on what you're most interested
14:26 - in so they have courses in different
14:28 - fields of mathematics or astronomy solar
14:31 - energy computational biology and all
14:34 - kinds of other great content so to
14:36 - support my channel and learn more about

14:51 - and again that's brilliant org /c m/s
14:55 - okay so I think that is going to do it
14:57 - for this video I hope you feel like you
14:59 - got a good understanding of how to use
15:01 - histograms and also when it might be
15:02 - appropriate for different kinds of
15:04 - datasets
15:05 - these are definitely nice when we have
15:07 - data like we did in this video where we
15:09 - want to divide those ages up into
15:12 - different bins and get an idea of those
15:14 - age distributions because like I was
15:16 - saying before you might be tempted to
15:18 - use a bar plot but when you have a
15:20 - hundred ages like this that means that
15:22 - we're going to have a hundred little
15:24 - bars and sometimes that just doesn't
15:25 - tell you the information that you're
15:27 - looking for and these histograms are
15:30 - better suited for that now in the next
15:32 - video we're going to be learning about
15:33 - Scott
15:33 - plots so scatter plots are great when we
15:35 - want to show the relationship between
15:37 - two sets of values and see how they're
15:39 - correlated so for example let's say that
15:41 - we wanted to see how salaries were
15:43 - correlated with age or something like
15:45 - that well we would probably assume that
15:48 - on average we'd see higher salaries with
15:51 - higher ages but to be sure we can plot
15:54 - that with a scatterplot and see what
15:56 - that data looks like so definitely be
15:58 - sure to check out that video but if
15:59 - anyone has any questions about what we

Cleaned transcript:

hey there how's it going everybody in this video we're going to be learning how to plot histograms so histograms are great for visualizing the distribution of data where the data falls within certain boundaries it's a lot like a bar graph but a histogram groups the data up into bins instead of plotting each individual value so the best way to see what this looks like is to just take a look at some examples now I would like to mention that we do have a sponsor for the series of videos and that is brilliant dot work so I really want to thank brilliant we're sponsoring this series and it would be great if you all could check them out using the link in the description section below and support the sponsors and I'll talk more about their services and just a bit so with that said let's go ahead and get started so I have a little starting code here that you might recognize if you're continuing from previous videos but if you're not then let me give a quick overview of the code here and what's what's going on ok so up here at the top of the code I am importing pandas I'm also importing pipe lot from matplotlib I'm using the 538 style 4 just to make our plots look a little nicer and here is the data that I'm going to be using for this video right now I just have a list of ages here between 18 and 55 I here's some data that I have commented out in a CSV file and we'll look at this once we get further along in the video and see how to plot out more data than just this small list ok so down here at the bottom we are also creating a title for our plot we have X and y axis labels we have a tight layout which just gives our plot some padding and also we are doing plot dot show which will actually show our plot now as usual if you'd like to follow along then I will have this code available on my github and there's a link to that and it's description section below if you want to go there and copy and paste this into your editor so that you can follow along with this exact data and I'm also going to have the data CSV file that I'm using in this video as well ok so like I was saying we're first gonna look at how to do this using this list of data directly here in the Python script and then we'll look at a real word example with data that I'll load in from a CSV file so first let's look at this small list of sample data so let's pretend that we took a survey and we track the ages of all the people who respond now it might be useful to plot those ages to get an idea of which age groups are in our sample size so how should we actually plot these well off the top of your head you might think that a bar chart would be a good idea for this but if you think about it we possibly have up to a hundred different possible ages maybe even more so if you plot it out how many responses we got from each age then that would mean you'd have almost a hundred different columns which definitely isn't useful so this is where histograms come in histograms allow us to create bins for our data and plot how many values fall into those bins so to see this let's create a histogram of this list of ages that we have here so to do this I can simply say BLT dot hist and we will plot out those ages now if I ran this now then it would give us a plot but really we wouldn't know what bins it's actually using so I always like to pass those in manually and explicitly so that people know what those bins are so when we specify bins we can either pass in an integer or a list of values if we pass in an integer then it will just may make that number of bins and divide our data into those accordingly so for example if I was to say bins is equal to 5 then this will divide all of these ages up into 5 different bins and then tell us how many people fell into those age ranges so if we run this then we can see that we get a pretty simple histogram here and what this is is a distribution here now I personally find it a bit difficult to read these sometimes if we don't have edge colors for each bin because they all just kind of run together here so I don't know exactly how many bins there are here and here I'm a guessing since we have five bins it's two bins here and three bins here but let's add in some edge color so that's more clear so we can add those in by going back to our plot here and I'm just going to pass that as an argument so edge color is equal to I'll just say black so now let's run this and now we can see those bins a bit more clearly so let me make this a little larger and also to where you can see the ages up here at the top and let me explain what this is actually doing so we said that we wanted our data plotted on a histogram and we wanted that broken up into five different bins so it calculated those ages for us so this looks like it's between let's see 18 and like 26 maybe and then 26 to 33 and so on but what this is telling us here is that there are four people in our ages here that fall between 18 to 26 and there are four people that fall between 26 to 33 and so on and then we just have one person in these higher age ranges for each of those bins so if you pass in an integer for our bins then that's what we get but we can also pass in our own list of values and those values will be the bins and I like passing in a list of bins for this kind of data because you have more control over the exact values so for example let's say that I wanted to plot the ages broken up into groups of ten year differences so I could say right here above my plot I'm gonna say bins is equal to and I'm just going to say that we want to bend for 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 and now instead of passing in that we want 5 bins I want to say that I want to use this list as my bins so now if I run this then we can see that we still get five different bins here but that's only because we have six values here in our list so it starts at 10 and then 10 to 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 40 to 50 and 50 to 60 so that is five bins total so if I open this back up now the reason I like using my own bins for this kind of data is because now it doesn't have to try to guess where I want these broken up so we can see that now we have from 10 to 20 it's a lot easier to read we don't have to guess it's like 26 or something like that so we're saying from 10 to 22 people and our ages list fell into that bin there were 4 people from 20 to 30 three from 30 to 40 one from 40 to 50 and one from 50 to 60 so that's how you plot and read a histogram and we can even exclude some data if we don't want to add those ranges to our bins so for example let's say that we didn't want to include the ages between 10 to 20 in my results well to do that we can just simply remove 10 from the bin and now 20 will be that leftmost value so now if we run this then now we can see that it's not even plotting out the ages from 10 to 20 there so this 19 and 20 don't even show up in our results here so this is now just giving us our results for the people who fell into these age ranges between 20 and 60 okay so now that we've looked at this small example now let's look at a real world example looking at some real data so let me uncomment what I've got here let me remove ages here so I'm just going to remove that data that is directly in our Python script now I'm going to uncomment out the data that I had down here let me cut that out and paste it here above our bins and our plot okay so I'm loading in this data is V file and I'm using this Panda stop read CSV method to do this now we've done this a few times so far in the series but if this is your first video that you are watching in the series then let me explain this really quick so we are loading in this data CSV so what this does is it goes to this see data CSV file here so let me explain what this survey data is so we have these responder IDs and this is just an ID for each person who responded to the survey so this is one person here this is another person here another person here and then our age column here is just the age for the people who responded to this survey so this person was 14 this person was nineteen twenty eight twenty two and so on so back here we have our IDs variable and we're setting that equal to data and then we are passing in this responder ID key so what that does is it sets those IDs equal to all of these IDs here that are in this responder ID column and here we're saying ages is equal to data age and that is setting that ages variable they're equal to this entire column here for our ages and the data that I'm using here are the responses from the 2019 stackoverflow developer survey so this is actually real data for people who answered that survey so we have let's see over 79,000 responses here in this data csv file okay so let's plot a histogram of the ages for this data set and see what age ranges most people fall into who answered this survey so I'm going to expand the bins here a bit and I'm gonna say 10 20 30 40 50 60 we'll also cover 70 80 whoops 80 90 and let's also put in a hundred there now since we called this ages variable here the same thing that we had before we don't even need to change our histogram plot because that is still just ages there so now I should be able to run this and get some real data here from this or some results here from that data so we can see here that based on this plot that almost 40,000 of the respondents were between the ages of 20 and 30 and almost 25 thousand were between the ages of 30 and 40 now it might not look like we have data for 70 to 80 and 80 to 90 but it's likely because there just weren't many responses with those ages and compared to 40,000 responses for the 20 to 30 group it's just too small to show up but I bet if I was to zoom in on these values here then we will start to see something okay so here's 70 to 80 if i zoom in here then we can see 80 to 83 so there are some responses there but they're just being dwarfed by these numbers over here now when you have certain values that are a lot more than your other values then you can plot this on a logarithmic scale to montón to not make this look so extreme so to do this we can add an argument of log equals true to our plot so within our hist method I'm just gonna say log is equal to true and now if I run this then this is plotting this on a logarithmic scale and we can see that now we do have that data visible for 70 to 80 80 to 90 and 90 to 100 so we actually had more people who responded to the survey that they were between the ages of 90 to 100 than the people who were between 80 and 90 so I think that's kind of interesting there now sometimes you might find it useful to add some additional information within these plots as well so for example let's just leave the histogram how we have it for now but let's say that we want to plot a vertical line where the median age of all the respondents is and I've got this commented out down here at the bottom here so let me uncomment out this median age and also I'm going to uncomment this color and this legend as well so I went through and I calculated the median age of all of the respondents and it was 29 years old so now let's plot a vertical line on our existing plot with that age so to do that just above our legend here I'm going to say PLT dot ax V line so I'm pretty sure that is stands for axis vertical line and we want that line to be plotted at the median age and now let's also I want to add in a color here and the custom color I'm going to add as this I think this is just a red color that I grabbed and also let's put in a label so that we know what this line represents and I'm just going to say age median so now let's run this and now we can see that within our histogram we now have this vertical line here which is the age median so this plot tells us a lot of things it tells us how many people are falling within which age groups who answered the survey and also where the median is for those survey results and if you think that this line is a little bit thick and kind of obstructing the data anyway then you can play around with how this looks so for example if you wanted to change the thickness there instead we could say line width is equal to two if I run that then that's a little thinner there so that's basically what these histogram plots are used for we can use these for dropping our data into these different bins and see how many values fall into these certain bins so that's what you would use a histogram for okay so we are just about finished up here but before we end I'd like to mention the sponsor of this video and that is brilliant org brilliant is a problemsolving website that helps you understand underlying concepts by actively working through guided lessons they have computer science courses ranging from algorithms and data structures to machine learning and neural networks they even have a coding environment built into their website so that you can run code directly in the browser and that's a great way to complement watching my tutorials because you can apply what you've learned and their active problemsolving environment and that helps to solidify that knowledge there are guided lessons will challenge you but you also have the ability to get hints or even solutions if you need them it's really tailored towards understanding that material so they're computer science material is fantastic and I really like what they're doing they also have plenty of courses depending on what you're most interested in so they have courses in

brilliant org /c m/s okay so I think that is going to do it for this video I hope you feel like you got a good understanding of how to use histograms and also when it might be appropriate for different kinds of datasets these are definitely nice when we have data like we did in this video where we want to divide those ages up into different bins and get an idea of those age distributions because like I was saying before you might be tempted to use a bar plot but when you have a hundred ages like this that means that we're going to have a hundred little bars and sometimes that just doesn't tell you the information that you're looking for and these histograms are better suited for that now in the next video we're going to be learning about Scott plots so scatter plots are great when we want to show the relationship between two sets of values and see how they're correlated so for example let's say that we wanted to see how salaries were correlated with age or something like that well we would probably assume that on average we'd see higher salaries with higher ages but to be sure we can plot that with a scatterplot and see what that data looks like so definitely be sure
