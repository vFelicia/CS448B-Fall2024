00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this series of videos we'll be going
00:02 - over the basics of Python programming
00:04 - now I get a lot of messages from people
00:06 - who say that they enjoy my Python videos
00:07 - but that they're either just getting
00:09 - started out in programming or coming
00:11 - from another language and would like a
00:12 - beginner's overview of Python so that
00:14 - they can better understand the more
00:16 - advanced topics and that's what we're
00:17 - going to do here we're going to cover
00:19 - how to get up and running with Python
00:20 - how to work with the different data
00:22 - types how to work with conditionals and
00:24 - loops and iterations how to create
00:27 - functions also importing modules and
00:30 - working with the standard library so
00:31 - basically everything that you need to
00:33 - know in order to have a firm
00:34 - understanding of the Python fundamentals
00:36 - now one thing I do want to point out is
00:38 - that throughout these tutorials I'm
00:39 - going to go over a few topics that I've
00:41 - already made eat more detailed videos
00:43 - about and anytime that happens I'll
00:45 - touch on the basics of that topic but
00:46 - then reference the more detailed video
00:48 - if you'd like to see more examples and
00:50 - that will allow us to move along at a
00:51 - good pace so let's go ahead and get
00:53 - started so first we're going to learn
00:55 - how to install Python and set up our
00:57 - development environment and we're going
00:58 - to look at how to do this on both Mac
01:00 - and Windows and this is pretty
01:02 - straightforward process
01:03 - so first we'll look at how to do this on
01:05 - a Mac but if you're on a Windows machine
01:06 - then you can look in the description
01:08 - section below and I'll put a link to the
01:10 - time stamp where we start the
01:12 - installation for Windows and that way
01:13 - you can skip ahead if you want or if you
01:16 - already have Python installed for your
01:17 - operating system and I also put a link
01:19 - to the time stamp or both of these
01:21 - installations are complete so that you
01:22 - can skip to where we're ready to write
01:24 - some code so for a Mac Python usually
01:26 - comes pre-installed the check if Python
01:29 - is pre-installed then we can just open
01:31 - up our terminal and within our terminal
01:34 - we can say Python - - version now we can
01:38 - see here that the default Python is
01:40 - Python - 7 now it used to be more
01:42 - controversial as to which version you
01:44 - want to use but almost everyone is
01:46 - moving over to Python 3 and if you're
01:48 - learning Python then you're definitely
01:49 - going to want to go with Python 3 unless
01:52 - you have a really good reason to do
01:53 - otherwise so let's go ahead and install
01:55 - the latest version of Python 3 so to do
01:58 - this we're just going to pull up an
01:59 - internet browser and we're going to go
02:01 - to the Python website which is here at
02:03 - python.org and from here we can go to
02:06 - downloads and we can see that it already
02:08 - detected that we're on a Mac and has
02:10 - offered up either python 3 or python 2
02:13 - and
02:13 - you want to go with the latest version
02:14 - Python 3.6 so that's going to download a
02:18 - pkg file and we will click on this to go
02:21 - ahead and start the installation now
02:22 - this is a pretty standard walkthrough
02:24 - here if you've installed software before
02:26 - then all a lot of this will look
02:27 - familiar so we're just going to agree to
02:29 - some terms you can change the install
02:31 - location if you want I'm just going to
02:32 - leave that as default and you may need
02:35 - to put in your password to install this
02:37 - now once that's finished installing it
02:40 - will place a Python 3:6 directory in
02:43 - your Applications folder and if we open
02:45 - up our Applications folder and scroll
02:48 - down here a bit and you can see I have
02:50 - an old version of Python 3 5 here but it
02:52 - installed this Python 3 6 and if we open
02:55 - this up and look inside here and we can
02:57 - see that we have this ID or Idol
03:00 - application and we'll come back to that
03:01 - in just a second so now that we have
03:03 - python 3 6 installed let's go back to
03:06 - our terminal and check our python
03:09 - version again so if i run that actually
03:12 - let me close down the terminal and open
03:14 - this back up just so that we're sure
03:15 - that we're starting with a fresh slate
03:17 - so now if I run that python version
03:19 - again then most likely you're going to
03:21 - see that it still says python 2 7 now
03:24 - the reason is because when we installed
03:26 - Python 3 it actually uses this Python 3
03:29 - command instead so if I instead use this
03:32 - Python 3 command and check that version
03:34 - and we can see that we get python 3 6
03:37 - that we just installed now if we want
03:39 - the Python command to use Python 3 then
03:42 - one way we can do this is to create an
03:44 - alias now to do this we can add a line
03:47 - to this dot bash profile file and if you
03:51 - don't know what that is then don't worry
03:53 - about it too much this is just going to
03:54 - allow us to associate the Python command
03:57 - with python 3 so you can use any editor
04:00 - to edit this file but since I'm already
04:02 - in the terminal I'm just going to go
04:03 - ahead and use nano and nano is pretty
04:05 - easy for beginners so I will say Nano
04:08 - now this is in your home directory so a
04:11 - tilde means your home directory and then
04:13 - a slash now this file is called bash
04:16 - underscore profile so now let's go ahead
04:18 - and open that up now within this file
04:20 - you might realize that I have some more
04:21 - content here than you do and these are
04:24 - just some personal customizations that I
04:26 - have but
04:26 - don't worry about any of this if I go to
04:28 - the bottom here and let me like make
04:30 - this just a little bit larger here now
04:34 - you should see that whenever you install
04:36 - the Python 3 that it actually added a
04:38 - few lines here at the bottom and you
04:40 - should have these lines also now setting
04:43 - this path variable like it's doing here
04:45 - is what allows the Python 3 command to
04:49 - work so we'll move down here below to
04:52 - the bottom and add an alias not to do
04:55 - this all we have to do is say alias
04:58 - Python equals Python 3 and you want to
05:02 - make sure it looks exactly like this no
05:03 - space between the equals or anything
05:05 - like that so now to save this we can
05:08 - just hit ctrl X to close hit Y that to
05:11 - say that we want to save it and then hit
05:13 - enter to keep that same filename so now
05:16 - if we quit out of our terminal and open
05:18 - this back up and now let's check that
05:21 - python version again so I'm going to do
05:23 - Python - - version and now we can see
05:26 - that it's using Python 3 6 now I
05:29 - probably should have mentioned this
05:30 - earlier but you do not have to create
05:32 - that Python alias if you wanted to you
05:35 - could just use that Python 3 command to
05:37 - run all of your scripts but I like to
05:40 - use this Python command so that's why I
05:42 - personally like to create the alias okay
05:45 - so now let's walk through how we install
05:46 - Python 3 for Windows now if you're on a
05:51 - Mac and want to skip through this part
05:52 - and you can click on the timestamp in
05:54 - the description below that skips forward
05:56 - when both of these installations are
05:58 - complete but this install for Windows
06:00 - actually doesn't take very long at all
06:01 - ok so to check if python is already
06:04 - installed we can open up our command
06:06 - prompt by going down here to start and
06:08 - then search for CMD and let's open up
06:12 - that and I'm going to make this font a
06:14 - little bit bigger so that we can see
06:15 - here I think I can click on properties
06:17 - and font and we'll go with something a
06:20 - little bit larger there okay now to see
06:23 - if we have access to Python we can just
06:25 - type in Python - - version and most
06:28 - likely you'll see that this is not yet
06:30 - installed and get this Python is not
06:32 - recognized err so to install this we can
06:35 - just open up an internet browser and go
06:36 - to the Python web site which is Python
06:39 - dot
06:40 - and from here we can click on downloads
06:42 - and from this page you can see that it's
06:44 - already detected that we are on Windows
06:47 - and has offered up either Python 3 or
06:49 - python 2 now if you're learning Python
06:52 - then you're definitely going to want to
06:53 - go with Python 3 unless you have a
06:55 - really good reason to do otherwise so
06:57 - let's go ahead and go with this download
06:59 - of python 3.6 so let's go ahead and run
07:02 - this download and we should get this
07:05 - pop-up so i'm going to go ahead and run
07:07 - that now this is an important step here
07:09 - one thing that you're going to want to
07:10 - do is click this option to add python 3
07:14 - 6 to your path this will allow us to get
07:17 - by without going into the advanced
07:19 - system settings and setting this path
07:21 - manually and adding that to your path
07:23 - will allow the Python command to work
07:25 - within the command prompt so with that
07:27 - selected now let's go ahead and just
07:28 - click through this installation and it
07:33 - says that setup was successful so now
07:35 - that python is installed let's come down
07:38 - here to our command prompt and open it
07:40 - back up actually let's close this one
07:42 - down and start from scratch so we'll
07:44 - open this back up type in CMD and open
07:47 - up that command prompt again and now we
07:49 - can make sure that that installed by
07:50 - typing in Python and then - - version
07:54 - you can see here that it says that we're
07:55 - working with Python 3 6 so that's good
07:58 - now if we come down here and click on
08:00 - start and all programs and we'll see
08:03 - that we have this Python 3 6 folder here
08:05 - that was installed with python within
08:07 - this folder we can see that we have a
08:09 - program called idle and I'm going to
08:12 - come back to this idle program in just a
08:14 - second so when I mention this program
08:16 - then just remember that you can find it
08:17 - here within this Python 3 6 folder so
08:20 - that is how we install Python for
08:22 - Windows now I'm going to switch back to
08:23 - my native operating system on the Mac
08:26 - but from this point on python is going
08:29 - to work the same for both operating
08:30 - systems so everyone is going to be able
08:32 - to follow along ok so now I'm just going
08:34 - to go ahead and minimize that ok so now
08:37 - that we have Python installed now we can
08:40 - begin and go ahead and write our first
08:42 - bit of code by opening up either our
08:44 - terminal or our command prompt and I'll
08:47 - just close this installation window down
08:49 - in the back here and Center this ok so
08:51 - now within the terminal or command
08:52 - prompt if
08:54 - just type in Python and this will open
08:56 - what's called an interactive prompt and
08:58 - we can see that it shows that we're
09:00 - using Python 3 6
09:03 - now the interactive prompt allows us to
09:05 - write one line of Python at a time so
09:07 - for example for a hello world
09:09 - application then we could simply write
09:11 - print hello world and we can see that it
09:15 - prints that out and we can also set
09:17 - variables so I could say X is equal to
09:20 - equal to 10 and if I print out X then we
09:25 - can see that we get 10 now this
09:27 - interactive prompt is OK for testing
09:29 - Python commands but we really want to
09:31 - have a Python file where we can write
09:33 - multiple lines and run an entire script
09:35 - so let's exit this interactive prompt
09:37 - and we can do that by typing exit and
09:39 - then opening closed parenthesis so to
09:42 - create a Python file we're going to need
09:44 - some kind of plain text editor when we
09:46 - downloaded Python it came with an editor
09:49 - called idle so let's open up that idle
09:51 - program so again on windows that's in
09:54 - the Python 3 6 folder that we opened up
09:57 - earlier and on the Mac it's just down
09:59 - here and our applications and we can go
10:01 - ahead and open this up so I'm going to
10:03 - go ahead and make the font a little bit
10:05 - bigger here by going to my preferences
10:07 - just so that everyone can see and I'll
10:09 - bump this up to 18 or so okay I think
10:12 - that's good now by default when we open
10:15 - up idle this is just another interactive
10:17 - prompt where we can write one line at a
10:19 - time and you can usually tell when
10:20 - you're at an interactive prompt because
10:22 - of these three arrows here so to create
10:25 - an actual file we can click on file and
10:28 - new file now this will create a new file
10:32 - where we can write multiple lines of
10:33 - Python and actually make a script so for
10:36 - our first script let's just print out
10:37 - hello world like we did before we can do
10:40 - that by calling the print function and
10:41 - then these opening and closing
10:43 - parenthesis and then either single or
10:45 - double quotes and then typing in hello
10:48 - world now we're going to want to save
10:50 - this file so we can save this by
10:51 - clicking on file and then save and I'm
10:55 - going to call this intro dot pi and I'm
10:58 - just going to save this to my desktop so
11:00 - now I'll go ahead and save that so now
11:04 - to run the python file that we just
11:05 - created we can go back to our terminal
11:08 - or our command prompt and from here we
11:10 - can type in Python and then we want to
11:13 - type in the name of the file that we
11:15 - want to run now this is relative to the
11:17 - directory that we're currently in so if
11:19 - we're in our home folder and when you
11:21 - saved it to your desktop then that
11:23 - should be in desktop and then the name
11:25 - of that file is intro dot pi so if we
11:29 - run that and you can see that it printed
11:31 - out hello world so we just ran our first
11:33 - Python program now I still have this
11:35 - Python file up over here and real quick
11:38 - let me show you how to do a single
11:40 - inline comment and Python because I'll
11:42 - be using these inline comments
11:44 - throughout these tutorials and don't
11:45 - want them to throw you off so in my
11:47 - script here if I wanted to write a
11:49 - description of what's going on then I
11:52 - could add a comment and to do this we
11:54 - can just start up here at the top line
11:57 - and I'm going to go ahead and write a
11:58 - comment of what we're doing so what it
12:00 - starts with the pound sign and then our
12:03 - comment so I'll just say print a welcome
12:05 - message now if I go ahead and save that
12:08 - file and then run this again from my
12:11 - desktop then you can see that it didn't
12:13 - do anything to our script that still
12:15 - just prints out hello world so when we
12:17 - actually run our Python programs these
12:19 - comments are ignored it's only there for
12:22 - the developer and the programmer to
12:24 - actually see what's going on now you
12:26 - don't need anything fancy to run these
12:28 - Python scripts so if you wanted to then
12:30 - you could follow through all of my
12:32 - videos using this idle application like
12:34 - we have running here and then running
12:37 - the script from the command line but if
12:39 - you plan on doing a lot of Python
12:41 - programming then you'll likely want to
12:43 - upgrade to a better editor now you can
12:45 - use any kind of plain text text editor
12:47 - that you want you can even use some
12:49 - command line editors like vim or Emacs
12:51 - if you'd like some of the most popular
12:54 - editors and I have some of these pulled
12:55 - up and the browser here so one very
12:58 - popular editor is sublime text and
13:01 - that's at sublime text calm another
13:03 - popular text editor is atom and that's
13:06 - at atom IO and a very popular IDE is the
13:11 - JetBrains
13:12 - pycharm ide so sublime text and atom are
13:15 - text editors but with a lot of extra
13:18 - functionality built in and PyCharm is a
13:21 - full
13:21 - loan ide and that will give you a lot of
13:24 - extra features that you might not find
13:26 - and other editors like the ability to
13:28 - debug a running application and things
13:30 - like that now in this series of videos
13:32 - i'm going to be using sublime text now i
13:35 - have a full video on how i set up and
13:37 - customize my sublime text and i also
13:39 - have a full video on how to set up and
13:42 - customize atom so if you want to use
13:44 - either of those editors and i highly
13:45 - recommend watching those videos and i'll
13:47 - leave links to those in the description
13:49 - section below now one nice thing about
13:51 - using one of these editors is that you
13:54 - can run Python from directly within the
13:56 - editor so I have the same intro PI file
13:59 - that we just created pulled up here in
14:01 - sublime text and I can run this by going
14:04 - to tools and build or we could have just
14:08 - used that keyboard shortcut but you can
14:10 - see that if we run that and we get the
14:11 - same hello world output that we got when
14:14 - we ran at this file from our command
14:16 - line so to follow along with these
14:18 - videos you can use the idle application
14:20 - and use the command line to run those
14:22 - scripts or you can set up one of these
14:24 - other text editors the choice is
14:26 - completely up to you okay so I think
14:28 - that is going to do it for this video in
14:29 - this video we walk through how to
14:31 - install Python on both Mac and Windows
14:33 - we looked at how to run Python
14:35 - interactively within the terminal or
14:37 - command line and we also have saw how to
14:39 - create a Python file and execute that
14:41 - script so in the next video we'll start
14:44 - learning about variables and datatypes
14:46 - and specifically we're going to look at
14:47 - the string datatype and everything that
14:49 - we can do with those but if anyone has
14:51 - any questions about what we covered in
14:52 - this video then feel free to ask in the
14:54 - comment section below and I'll do my
14:56 - best to answer those now if you enjoy
14:57 - these tutorials and would like to
14:59 - support them there are several ways you
15:00 - can do that the easiest ways to simply
15:02 - like the video and give it a thumbs up
15:03 - and also it's a huge help to share these
15:05 - videos with anyone who you think would
15:07 - find them useful and if you have the
15:08 - means you can contribute through patreon
15:10 - and there's a link to that page in the
15:11 - description section below be sure to
15:13 - subscribe for future videos and thank
15:15 - you all for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey there how's it going everybody in this series of videos we'll be going over the basics of Python programming now I get a lot of messages from people who say that they enjoy my Python videos but that they're either just getting started out in programming or coming from another language and would like a beginner's overview of Python so that they can better understand the more advanced topics and that's what we're going to do here we're going to cover how to get up and running with Python how to work with the different data types how to work with conditionals and loops and iterations how to create functions also importing modules and working with the standard library so basically everything that you need to know in order to have a firm understanding of the Python fundamentals now one thing I do want to point out is that throughout these tutorials I'm going to go over a few topics that I've already made eat more detailed videos about and anytime that happens I'll touch on the basics of that topic but then reference the more detailed video if you'd like to see more examples and that will allow us to move along at a good pace so let's go ahead and get started so first we're going to learn how to install Python and set up our development environment and we're going to look at how to do this on both Mac and Windows and this is pretty straightforward process so first we'll look at how to do this on a Mac but if you're on a Windows machine then you can look in the description section below and I'll put a link to the time stamp where we start the installation for Windows and that way you can skip ahead if you want or if you already have Python installed for your operating system and I also put a link to the time stamp or both of these installations are complete so that you can skip to where we're ready to write some code so for a Mac Python usually comes preinstalled the check if Python is preinstalled then we can just open up our terminal and within our terminal we can say Python version now we can see here that the default Python is Python 7 now it used to be more controversial as to which version you want to use but almost everyone is moving over to Python 3 and if you're learning Python then you're definitely going to want to go with Python 3 unless you have a really good reason to do otherwise so let's go ahead and install the latest version of Python 3 so to do this we're just going to pull up an internet browser and we're going to go to the Python website which is here at python.org and from here we can go to downloads and we can see that it already detected that we're on a Mac and has offered up either python 3 or python 2 and you want to go with the latest version Python 3.6 so that's going to download a pkg file and we will click on this to go ahead and start the installation now this is a pretty standard walkthrough here if you've installed software before then all a lot of this will look familiar so we're just going to agree to some terms you can change the install location if you want I'm just going to leave that as default and you may need to put in your password to install this now once that's finished installing it will place a Python 36 directory in your Applications folder and if we open up our Applications folder and scroll down here a bit and you can see I have an old version of Python 3 5 here but it installed this Python 3 6 and if we open this up and look inside here and we can see that we have this ID or Idol application and we'll come back to that in just a second so now that we have python 3 6 installed let's go back to our terminal and check our python version again so if i run that actually let me close down the terminal and open this back up just so that we're sure that we're starting with a fresh slate so now if I run that python version again then most likely you're going to see that it still says python 2 7 now the reason is because when we installed Python 3 it actually uses this Python 3 command instead so if I instead use this Python 3 command and check that version and we can see that we get python 3 6 that we just installed now if we want the Python command to use Python 3 then one way we can do this is to create an alias now to do this we can add a line to this dot bash profile file and if you don't know what that is then don't worry about it too much this is just going to allow us to associate the Python command with python 3 so you can use any editor to edit this file but since I'm already in the terminal I'm just going to go ahead and use nano and nano is pretty easy for beginners so I will say Nano now this is in your home directory so a tilde means your home directory and then a slash now this file is called bash underscore profile so now let's go ahead and open that up now within this file you might realize that I have some more content here than you do and these are just some personal customizations that I have but don't worry about any of this if I go to the bottom here and let me like make this just a little bit larger here now you should see that whenever you install the Python 3 that it actually added a few lines here at the bottom and you should have these lines also now setting this path variable like it's doing here is what allows the Python 3 command to work so we'll move down here below to the bottom and add an alias not to do this all we have to do is say alias Python equals Python 3 and you want to make sure it looks exactly like this no space between the equals or anything like that so now to save this we can just hit ctrl X to close hit Y that to say that we want to save it and then hit enter to keep that same filename so now if we quit out of our terminal and open this back up and now let's check that python version again so I'm going to do Python version and now we can see that it's using Python 3 6 now I probably should have mentioned this earlier but you do not have to create that Python alias if you wanted to you could just use that Python 3 command to run all of your scripts but I like to use this Python command so that's why I personally like to create the alias okay so now let's walk through how we install Python 3 for Windows now if you're on a Mac and want to skip through this part and you can click on the timestamp in the description below that skips forward when both of these installations are complete but this install for Windows actually doesn't take very long at all ok so to check if python is already installed we can open up our command prompt by going down here to start and then search for CMD and let's open up that and I'm going to make this font a little bit bigger so that we can see here I think I can click on properties and font and we'll go with something a little bit larger there okay now to see if we have access to Python we can just type in Python version and most likely you'll see that this is not yet installed and get this Python is not recognized err so to install this we can just open up an internet browser and go to the Python web site which is Python dot and from here we can click on downloads and from this page you can see that it's already detected that we are on Windows and has offered up either Python 3 or python 2 now if you're learning Python then you're definitely going to want to go with Python 3 unless you have a really good reason to do otherwise so let's go ahead and go with this download of python 3.6 so let's go ahead and run this download and we should get this popup so i'm going to go ahead and run that now this is an important step here one thing that you're going to want to do is click this option to add python 3 6 to your path this will allow us to get by without going into the advanced system settings and setting this path manually and adding that to your path will allow the Python command to work within the command prompt so with that selected now let's go ahead and just click through this installation and it says that setup was successful so now that python is installed let's come down here to our command prompt and open it back up actually let's close this one down and start from scratch so we'll open this back up type in CMD and open up that command prompt again and now we can make sure that that installed by typing in Python and then version you can see here that it says that we're working with Python 3 6 so that's good now if we come down here and click on start and all programs and we'll see that we have this Python 3 6 folder here that was installed with python within this folder we can see that we have a program called idle and I'm going to come back to this idle program in just a second so when I mention this program then just remember that you can find it here within this Python 3 6 folder so that is how we install Python for Windows now I'm going to switch back to my native operating system on the Mac but from this point on python is going to work the same for both operating systems so everyone is going to be able to follow along ok so now I'm just going to go ahead and minimize that ok so now that we have Python installed now we can begin and go ahead and write our first bit of code by opening up either our terminal or our command prompt and I'll just close this installation window down in the back here and Center this ok so now within the terminal or command prompt if just type in Python and this will open what's called an interactive prompt and we can see that it shows that we're using Python 3 6 now the interactive prompt allows us to write one line of Python at a time so for example for a hello world application then we could simply write print hello world and we can see that it prints that out and we can also set variables so I could say X is equal to equal to 10 and if I print out X then we can see that we get 10 now this interactive prompt is OK for testing Python commands but we really want to have a Python file where we can write multiple lines and run an entire script so let's exit this interactive prompt and we can do that by typing exit and then opening closed parenthesis so to create a Python file we're going to need some kind of plain text editor when we downloaded Python it came with an editor called idle so let's open up that idle program so again on windows that's in the Python 3 6 folder that we opened up earlier and on the Mac it's just down here and our applications and we can go ahead and open this up so I'm going to go ahead and make the font a little bit bigger here by going to my preferences just so that everyone can see and I'll bump this up to 18 or so okay I think that's good now by default when we open up idle this is just another interactive prompt where we can write one line at a time and you can usually tell when you're at an interactive prompt because of these three arrows here so to create an actual file we can click on file and new file now this will create a new file where we can write multiple lines of Python and actually make a script so for our first script let's just print out hello world like we did before we can do that by calling the print function and then these opening and closing parenthesis and then either single or double quotes and then typing in hello world now we're going to want to save this file so we can save this by clicking on file and then save and I'm going to call this intro dot pi and I'm just going to save this to my desktop so now I'll go ahead and save that so now to run the python file that we just created we can go back to our terminal or our command prompt and from here we can type in Python and then we want to type in the name of the file that we want to run now this is relative to the directory that we're currently in so if we're in our home folder and when you saved it to your desktop then that should be in desktop and then the name of that file is intro dot pi so if we run that and you can see that it printed out hello world so we just ran our first Python program now I still have this Python file up over here and real quick let me show you how to do a single inline comment and Python because I'll be using these inline comments throughout these tutorials and don't want them to throw you off so in my script here if I wanted to write a description of what's going on then I could add a comment and to do this we can just start up here at the top line and I'm going to go ahead and write a comment of what we're doing so what it starts with the pound sign and then our comment so I'll just say print a welcome message now if I go ahead and save that file and then run this again from my desktop then you can see that it didn't do anything to our script that still just prints out hello world so when we actually run our Python programs these comments are ignored it's only there for the developer and the programmer to actually see what's going on now you don't need anything fancy to run these Python scripts so if you wanted to then you could follow through all of my videos using this idle application like we have running here and then running the script from the command line but if you plan on doing a lot of Python programming then you'll likely want to upgrade to a better editor now you can use any kind of plain text text editor that you want you can even use some command line editors like vim or Emacs if you'd like some of the most popular editors and I have some of these pulled up and the browser here so one very popular editor is sublime text and that's at sublime text calm another popular text editor is atom and that's at atom IO and a very popular IDE is the JetBrains pycharm ide so sublime text and atom are text editors but with a lot of extra functionality built in and PyCharm is a full loan ide and that will give you a lot of extra features that you might not find and other editors like the ability to debug a running application and things like that now in this series of videos i'm going to be using sublime text now i have a full video on how i set up and customize my sublime text and i also have a full video on how to set up and customize atom so if you want to use either of those editors and i highly recommend watching those videos and i'll leave links to those in the description section below now one nice thing about using one of these editors is that you can run Python from directly within the editor so I have the same intro PI file that we just created pulled up here in sublime text and I can run this by going to tools and build or we could have just used that keyboard shortcut but you can see that if we run that and we get the same hello world output that we got when we ran at this file from our command line so to follow along with these videos you can use the idle application and use the command line to run those scripts or you can set up one of these other text editors the choice is completely up to you okay so I think that is going to do it for this video in this video we walk through how to install Python on both Mac and Windows we looked at how to run Python interactively within the terminal or command line and we also have saw how to create a Python file and execute that script so in the next video we'll start learning about variables and datatypes and specifically we're going to look at the string datatype and everything that we can do with those but if anyone has any questions about what we covered in this video then feel free to ask in the comment section below and I'll do my best to answer those now if
