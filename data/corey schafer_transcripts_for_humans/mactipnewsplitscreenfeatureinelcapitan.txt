00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video we're gonna take a look at the new
00:03 - split screen feature that's shipped with
00:05 - the newest version of OS X it's called
00:08 - El Capitan
00:08 - now the split screen feature is
00:10 - something that I think has been missing
00:13 - from the Mac for a long time and I even
00:15 - did a video a while back on some
00:17 - third-party software that I use called
00:19 - hyper dock which has this boot screen
00:22 - functionality because I use split screen
00:24 - Windows so often and I need something
00:27 - that does them efficiently now I'm
00:29 - actually still more of a fan of hyper
00:31 - dock than I am of the native split
00:33 - screen functionality in El Capitan but
00:36 - even having the functionality available
00:37 - is a step in the right direction and
00:40 - hopefully they will continue to improve
00:41 - upon it in the future
00:43 - so with that said let's go ahead and get
00:45 - started and see how to use this new
00:47 - split-screen functionality so first you
00:49 - need to be sure that you've updated your
00:51 - operating system to the newest version
00:53 - now once you've done this then so this
00:57 - maximize button here if you click this
00:59 - it'll maximize a window now in the
01:02 - latest version if you click and hold
01:03 - this then it'll give you an option to
01:06 - choose which side of the screen that you
01:08 - want this to be on split screen so if I
01:11 - choose the right side of the screen here
01:13 - now it's going to take my other programs
01:15 - and applications and I'm running and
01:17 - it's going to spread them out over here
01:18 - and what at once is for me to choose
01:20 - which one of these I want to share the
01:23 - other half of the screen so if I click
01:24 - on my terminal window here then now you
01:27 - can see that both of these programs are
01:30 - in split screen now what are the things
01:32 - that I like most about the native split
01:34 - screen functionality is how both windows
01:36 - are resized at the same time if you move
01:39 - this middle point so if I click and drag
01:41 - here then you can see that I never have
01:44 - to worry about one application
01:45 - overlapping the other because they're
01:48 - both resized at the same time so if I
01:50 - want one half of the screen to be more
01:52 - dominant than the other and see maybe I
01:55 - don't need as much room here in the
01:56 - terminal so I can make that a little
01:59 - smaller while I'm over here working and
02:01 - then for my text editor here this can be
02:03 - a little bit larger and and then I can
02:06 - come over here and do what I need to do
02:08 - so it's nice to have that functionality
02:09 - built in so that I can move the windows
02:12 - around to diff
02:13 - sizes without having to fuss too much
02:16 - with which one is overlapping another
02:18 - now another thing I really like about
02:20 - this is that they really provide as much
02:22 - real estate as possible so that you'll
02:24 - see that there's no border here in the
02:27 - middle it's just they do as little as
02:29 - possible so that you have as much screen
02:31 - to work with and it's just nice to have
02:34 - all this extra room now there's actually
02:37 - another way that we can do split-screen
02:39 - instead of clicking and dragging on the
02:42 - maximize button what we can do instead
02:45 - is so if I go ahead and maximize one of
02:50 - these and then go back over here to my
02:52 - desktop now if you're familiar with the
02:54 - Mac's then you should be familiar with
02:56 - being able to flip between the desktop
02:58 - and full screen applications but if you
03:01 - don't know how to do this that all I'm
03:03 - doing is holding in the control key and
03:05 - using my arrows to switch back and forth
03:07 - between the desktop and these full
03:08 - screen applications so now that we're
03:10 - back here to our desktop another way to
03:13 - do this split screen is instead of
03:14 - clicking and holding on this maximize
03:17 - button here since we already have a full
03:18 - screen application open I can just drag
03:21 - this up here to the top and once this
03:24 - opens up you can see that I have a
03:25 - desktop here and I also have my full
03:27 - screen window here now if I drag this
03:30 - over the full screen you can kind of see
03:32 - that it puts this overlay down and it'll
03:34 - tell me where which side of the screen I
03:37 - can drop this on so if I drop this on
03:39 - the left side of the screen here and
03:40 - then click on this window now those are
03:43 - in split screen mode so that's pretty
03:46 - much it for the new split-screen
03:48 - functionality I'm really glad that they
03:50 - finally have this available on the Mac
03:52 - it's been in Windows for a while but I
03:54 - do still like the third-party
03:57 - application hyper dock a little bit more
03:59 - and there's a couple of reasons for that
04:01 - so let me go ahead and get out of split
04:04 - screen mode here and then I'll open up a
04:07 - hyper dock and show you a couple of
04:09 - things that I like a little bit more and
04:11 - hopefully that maybe they'll get added
04:13 - to future versions of this split screen
04:15 - functionality so I'm just going to go
04:17 - ahead and open this up now I'm not going
04:19 - to go into too much detail because I
04:20 - have already done an entire video on
04:22 - hyper dock so I'm not going to go into
04:25 - too much detail
04:26 - but a couple of the things that I like
04:28 - more about it so for example I can just
04:31 - take this window and drag it to the
04:33 - right side of the screen here and it
04:34 - automatically takes up one half of the
04:36 - screen now if I wanted to do a quarter
04:40 - of the screen then I can take this
04:42 - terminal window and drag it to the top
04:44 - left and it takes up the top left corner
04:46 - and then for this one I could drag it
04:48 - down here and take up the bottom
04:50 - left-hand corner so you can see see
04:53 - instead of just to split halves of the
04:55 - screen you kind of have more options of
04:57 - what you can do with this and I actually
04:59 - use this a lot of the time whenever I'm
05:01 - doing
05:02 - whenever I have multiple terminal
05:03 - windows open here or terminal sessions
05:05 - running and I want to see what's going
05:06 - on in both and not having them overlap
05:09 - each other now another thing that I
05:11 - really like about hyper dock and this
05:12 - doesn't have anything to do with split
05:14 - screen functionality but I would like to
05:16 - see this at some point on the Mac is
05:19 - that hyperduck gives you these these
05:22 - previews to your open applications so
05:25 - for example if I have I have my Chrome
05:27 - browser open here with a couple of
05:28 - different windows and if I scroll over a
05:31 - chrome that I can see the different web
05:33 - sites that I'm on here and it also works
05:36 - with like music players so on Spotify if
05:39 - I scroll over Spotify here instead of
05:41 - opening up Spotify and playing what I
05:43 - need I can just scroll over here and get
05:46 - quick ask access to whatever is playing
05:48 - so I can go ahead and play a song and
05:50 - and do that that way so it's just nice
05:54 - to be able to preview those windows and
05:56 - be able to make those clicks and changes
06:00 - like that without fussing around with
06:02 - moving windows around and going in and
06:05 - out of full screen and things like that
06:06 - now like I said there are a lot of
06:09 - things that I like about the native
06:10 - split-screen functionality I really like
06:12 - how the windows are tied together so for
06:15 - instance here whenever I resize one of
06:17 - these windows it doesn't resize the
06:19 - other I like how they both move together
06:22 - in the native functionality and also I
06:24 - like how it provides so much more screen
06:27 - real estate so all these borders are
06:29 - gone and you really have that room to
06:31 - work with so yeah like I said I think
06:33 - it's a step in the right direction
06:34 - hopefully we'll see some there's certain
06:37 - updates I would like to see with it but
06:38 - if
06:39 - all you're looking for is two different
06:41 - for two programs to be in split screen
06:44 - then it's a great option for you so
06:46 - definitely give it a try so that about
06:48 - does it for this video if you guys have
06:49 - any questions just ask in the comment
06:51 - section below
