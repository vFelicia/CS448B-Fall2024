00:12 - okay did that do it all right can
00:25 - everybody hear me okay
00:28 - sometimes I have problems with this
00:30 - microphone where you can only hear from
00:32 - one side so hopefully you can hear from
00:35 - both sides of the alright okay so
00:44 - hopefully this is working I know that a
00:47 - lot of us are stuck in our homes right
00:51 - now with everything going on so I
00:53 - figured I just hop on and we could just
00:57 - chat and have just a laid-back kind of
01:00 - session and maybe do some coding maybe
01:03 - answer some questions and things like
01:05 - that I've got a couple of drinks here so
01:07 - I can have some drinks while we're doing
01:08 - some coding might not be the best idea
01:10 - but so what would you guys like to see
01:16 - this is my first live stream that I've
01:19 - ever had so we could just have a Q&A and
01:25 - I could kind of read the chats back and
01:26 - forth for a little bit and answer some
01:28 - questions or I could just jump in and
01:30 - start start doing some code worst
01:34 - problems for you guys we can kind of do
01:37 - a mix of both comments are coming in
01:41 - pretty quick I didn't expect this well
01:47 - thank you guys yeah
01:58 - okay so it looks like some people want
02:01 - to do kind of like a QA at the beginning
02:04 - I've never I've did a Q&A video a long
02:06 - time ago and call somebody send a super
02:11 - chat thank you for all the Python videos
02:12 - thank you for that so I did a Q&A a long
02:17 - time ago I think that's back when I had
02:19 - gosh it was probably I don't know five
02:22 - thousand subscribers or something it's
02:23 - been several years since I've done one
02:26 - so yeah let's go ahead and answer a few
02:31 - common questions here okay somebody
02:33 - asked vs code versus sublime text so it
02:40 - really depends on what you want to do
02:42 - I'd say a lot of you have probably
02:44 - noticed that I use sublime text in my
02:46 - videos but the reason that I use sublime
02:49 - text in my videos is mainly because it
02:53 - is very minimalist and it just lets you
02:57 - see the code and the output without
02:59 - anything else getting in the way so I
03:02 - used that for the videos so that people
03:05 - can see when I'm doing without all this
03:07 - other stuff kind of taking up their
03:09 - peripheral vision but vs code is a very
03:12 - good editor I have a video on how to set
03:15 - that up as well so whenever I'm actually
03:18 - working on projects I will use vs code
03:21 - to actually work on projects because
03:23 - that way I get access to the debugger I
03:26 - get access to the I get access to being
03:33 - able to jump into the code and things
03:36 - like that and seeing all the packages
03:38 - that I have installed so I actually like
03:40 - the s code more for actually working on
03:44 - projects but I use sublime text for kind
03:47 - of day-to-day coding just being able to
03:48 - do things like that I also have a couple
03:51 - of questions here
03:53 - thank you for pandas and Jango series oh
03:56 - you're welcome I'm glad that you like
03:58 - those that is from Alpha Umar Diallo
04:05 - thank you
04:07 - I also have some questions here that I
04:12 - have pulled up excuse me
04:15 - and these are some common questions that
04:17 - I have that I just wrote down before we
04:21 - started the livestream just in case I
04:23 - didn't get too many questions pulling in
04:25 - from the chat but I also answer some
04:27 - questions from the chat as well but a
04:29 - lot of people just ask me you know what
04:31 - is your full-time job or what do you do
04:33 - full-time so recently now I'm actually
04:37 - doing YouTube full-time so before I was
04:40 - doing YouTube full-time I've had several
04:43 - different jobs I worked in I grew up in
04:45 - West Virginia and I lived in West
04:47 - Virginia for most of my life and always
04:49 - worked at universities and I used to
04:52 - work at a GIS lab and that's where I
04:56 - actually started or I worked at gs GIS
04:59 - lab at West Virginia University and
05:01 - that's actually where I first started
05:03 - using Python before that I was a
05:05 - JavaScript developer full-time and then
05:07 - I started using some Python scripts on
05:10 - the back end and that was probably
05:12 - that's around the time that I started
05:14 - making my videos like my very first
05:16 - videos which will probably I don't know
05:18 - about six years ago now or something
05:20 - like that that's when I was basically
05:22 - just getting into Python and I was
05:25 - making the videos just so that I could
05:27 - learn personally and and it kind of grew
05:32 - from there and then I moved out to
05:33 - Boulder Colorado and got a full-time job
05:35 - in Python doing some flash web
05:39 - development on the back end and then we
05:46 - also did a lot of system and sorry this
05:50 - is my first this is my first live stream
05:53 - and I'm sure I'll get used to it
05:55 - eventually if you guys like this kind of
05:57 - video then I can do more of these but
05:59 - it's it's kind of I'm getting used to
06:01 - talking and seeing all the chats coming
06:03 - in at the same time so it's so if I get
06:06 - distracted then sorry about that but
06:10 - yeah so I was mainly working in flash
06:13 - development doing some back-end web
06:15 - services and then moved on to do some
06:19 - more system administration
06:21 - stuff with using things like ansible and
06:24 - then after I did went YouTube for full
06:28 - time that's been over a year now I ended
06:31 - up moving back east and moving to
06:34 - Greenville South Carolina where I live
06:36 - now so and now I'm just doing Utah
06:39 - YouTube's full-time here and putting
06:41 - courses together okay let me check some
06:48 - of these super chats I don't want to
06:49 - miss any of these just to make sure I
06:53 - answer any questions that are coming in
06:55 - here because it's so hard to thank you
06:58 - all for the Python and Django videos
07:00 - thank you thank you for helping me
07:04 - understand higher-order functions
07:08 - closures and decorators keep up the good
07:10 - work I'm glad you guys enjoy those so
07:17 - another question that I get a lot is
07:20 - people ask me a best way to prepare a
07:23 - portfolio so this is kind of a difficult
07:28 - question because it really depends it
07:33 - really depends on the the job that
07:36 - you're going for but I would always say
07:39 - that the best way to prepare a portfolio
07:41 - I've said this a couple of times when
07:44 - people ask me this question is I think
07:47 - the best thing you can do if you're
07:48 - preparing for a job or trying to get a
07:51 - job is to make a website with all of
07:55 - your let make a personal website and it
07:59 - depends on the time frame as well so if
08:01 - you were a time frame for getting a new
08:04 - job is within the next you know a few
08:08 - weeks or months and you don't have time
08:09 - to build a website from scratch then
08:11 - there's nothing wrong with those
08:13 - services that just allowed you allow you
08:15 - to easily build a website like you know
08:18 - what are some of the services like wicks
08:20 - or Squarespace or something like that or
08:24 - something like WordPress but whenever I
08:26 - say to build a website for your
08:28 - portfolio what I think the best thing to
08:30 - do in the long term is to go in with
08:34 - something like
08:35 - flask or like Django if you're a Python
08:37 - developer and take what you have learned
08:42 - there and it's going to expose you to so
08:45 - many other technologies as well so
08:48 - you're going to learn Python because
08:49 - you're going to be building a website in
08:51 - flask or you were going to be building
08:53 - the website and Django and from there
08:56 - you're going to have to host the website
08:59 - so you're going to get a hosting service
09:00 - either like Heroku or like the node or
09:04 - something like that and you're it's most
09:06 - likely going to be a Linux server of
09:08 - some kind so you're going to get some
09:10 - linux experience and some system and
09:11 - administration experience by logging
09:14 - into that and and doing you know setting
09:18 - up security and setting up things like
09:20 - that you're going to learn SQL and
09:23 - databases if your website has a database
09:25 - so making a website will really expose
09:28 - you to kind of all the different areas
09:30 - that you can learn and that will be and
09:37 - that's something that's going to be
09:39 - really valuable to employers whenever
09:41 - they see that on your portfolio so
09:43 - that's always my recommendation if
09:45 - somebody doesn't have anything and
09:47 - they're just looking for something
09:49 - eye-catching that they can show to
09:51 - somebody then I always recommend you
09:53 - know making a website ok let me grab
09:57 - another beer here so let's see I grabbed
10:01 - a bunch of local beer as well whenever I
10:03 - went in the town so alright I'll take
10:07 - this one this one is from Asheville
10:09 - North Carolina Gaelic ale so let's try
10:14 - this out ok let me catch up on some of
10:23 - these questions here these are scrolling
10:27 - back past pretty quickly ok well you do
10:34 - a series on machine learning yes I
10:37 - definitely want to do a machine learning
10:39 - series mmm it people ask me this a lot
10:42 - now the reason that I haven't put
10:45 - together a series on machine learning
10:46 - yet
10:48 - is just because it is such a large topic
10:52 - to cover so it is something that I'm a
10:57 - bit intimidated to kind of tackle
11:00 - because when I do a series like the
11:02 - Panda series that I'm working on now you
11:04 - know I've probably been working on that
11:06 - series now for about four months or
11:09 - something like that so and that's gonna
11:11 - be that's not going to be as large of a
11:15 - topic as machine learning so I just know
11:18 - that it's going to take a lot of time
11:19 - but I know that a lot of people are
11:20 - looking for that so I will start working
11:23 - on something like that here soon but
11:25 - it's definitely gonna be a big
11:26 - commitment so I've been a little slow to
11:28 - to do that but I know that a lot of
11:31 - people want that so I will start working
11:32 - on a machine learning course here in the
11:35 - near future okay let's see best websites
11:49 - to learn a w s gosh I would say that the
11:54 - best websites learn AWS I did a little
11:56 - bit of AWS training back whenever I was
11:58 - at my last job and I think that Amazon
12:01 - as far as I could tell Amazon had the
12:04 - best training for AWS on their own
12:07 - personal websites AWS is a hard thing to
12:11 - it's a hard thing to teach and it's a
12:13 - hard thing to make tutorials about
12:16 - because they are adding so much so often
12:18 - I think they're starting to kind of
12:20 - settle on some things that won't be
12:23 - changed too often now but whenever it
12:24 - first came out there were just you know
12:27 - hundreds of services being added on you
12:30 - it seemed like every year there were
12:32 - hundreds of new services so let's see
12:35 - here okay more about machine learning
12:43 - what is your age I'm 33 years old
12:51 - Oh is flasks better than Django okay so
12:56 - this is a question that I get a lot
12:57 - especially since I've done a video on
12:59 - for a series on flask and a series on
13:02 - Django in my opinion there isn't one
13:07 - that is better it just depends on what
13:09 - you are doing
13:10 - so flask is what they call a micro
13:12 - framework so flask is you I use flask a
13:16 - lot because I usually don't need all the
13:19 - bells and whistles of Django
13:22 - but Django comes built-in so flask will
13:25 - give you hardly any functionality out of
13:27 - the box and you can come up with a
13:29 - complete website with just one file
13:32 - that's all you need
13:33 - but Django is kind of intimidating for
13:35 - beginners because you download it and
13:38 - you're handed this entire directory with
13:41 - all these different things and it's kind
13:42 - of hard to you know to look at that and
13:45 - to know even where to start but it comes
13:48 - with so much out of the box you have an
13:50 - admin panel where you can create users
13:52 - and things like that so it depends on
13:57 - what you're doing if you need a very
13:58 - simple website like say that you're
14:01 - making a static website generator or
14:03 - something like that then I would
14:05 - definitely recommend flask for that but
14:08 - something like Django if you need an
14:10 - entire user system then it's probably
14:13 - better to go with Django since that
14:16 - comes with all that out of the box and
14:18 - people have put in so much work in
14:19 - making these secure user systems and
14:22 - that's just a bunch of code that you
14:23 - don't have to rewrite yourself so I
14:26 - would recommend a Django for those
14:28 - applications where you want all that
14:30 - out-of-the-box functionality and I would
14:32 - recommend flask for simpler websites
14:38 - quarry you coughed I'll probably be
14:41 - coughing a lot it probably wasn't a
14:43 - great idea to drink beers on stream
14:46 - whenever I have my mic right in my mouth
14:48 - and I'm sure I'm gonna be burping a lot
14:50 - as well so but I'll try to cover up the
14:57 - mic when I do that so I don't curse you
14:59 - guys out
15:03 - okay let's see what else we got here do
15:06 - you have a CS degree yes I went to I
15:08 - have a computer science degree I went to
15:10 - Marshall University in Huntington West
15:12 - Virginia and I got my computer science
15:14 - degree from there okay let's see and if
15:26 - we run out of questions here then I can
15:27 - go ahead and just start coding up some
15:30 - sample problems and you guys can kind of
15:33 - watch as I solve some problems here or
15:36 - try to solve some problems
15:48 - okay from our June hopefully I don't if
15:51 - I mess up these names I'm very sorry but
15:54 - it looks like our June said Cory thanks
15:57 - for being an inspiration I'm a developer
15:59 - now after starting to learn from you do
16:02 - more videos like react and flask and
16:04 - come to human you too me too
16:06 - okay yeah I've heard a lot about react I
16:10 - actually haven't used react personally
16:12 - but I haven't seen a big demand for that
16:17 - lately it's been a long time since I've
16:19 - got dope back into the JavaScript world
16:21 - back when I did JavaScript full time
16:23 - that was before es6 even came out so
16:27 - that was probably I think the biggest
16:31 - framework back then was probably ember
16:33 - j/s I don't even know if that's if
16:35 - people still use ember or not but that
16:37 - was before angular and all that stuff so
16:40 - it's been a while since I've done
16:41 - JavaScript coding but I do know that a
16:44 - lot of people have told me to do react
16:46 - in flask so that would be that would be
16:49 - a fun series to do will I do a web
16:57 - scraping series well I've put together
17:01 - several web scraping videos already so I
17:04 - have one on beautifulsoup and I have one
17:07 - on requests HTML and requests HTML was
17:11 - written by the same person who wrote the
17:13 - request library Kenneth rights and but
17:17 - those are kind of the basics of web
17:19 - scraping if you want me to do something
17:22 - more in-depth like you know maybe
17:27 - crawling some dynamic sites that have
17:29 - JavaScript and things like that then
17:32 - yeah I could use a framework like scrapy
17:36 - or mechanize or something like that we
17:39 - could definitely put together a series
17:40 - like that and the same thing with async
17:43 - io that's kind of the same thing that I
17:46 - was talking about with the machine
17:48 - learning is I definitely want to do an
17:51 - async IO course but it's something
17:53 - that's kind of a large topic that a lot
17:55 - of people that I just know will take me
17:59 - a while to put together
18:01 - so I've been a little hesitant to do
18:04 - that because sometimes I get burned out
18:06 - on these courses like this pandas
18:08 - courses has taken a long time and I'm
18:10 - getting getting to the end of that
18:11 - course now and I'm getting you know a
18:15 - little burn out on pandas but after I
18:18 - put out these next couple of videos then
18:20 - I'm probably going to take a break from
18:22 - pandas for a while and then go back to
18:24 - someone off videos and and go from there
18:27 - and but yeah async is definitely on the
18:29 - list of stuff to cover okay
18:50 - any plans for a PI spark development
18:54 - series in the future well it's not in
19:00 - the immediate future I've had a lot of
19:01 - people that have asked about that so I
19:04 - definitely have it written down but
19:07 - probably I don't know if I'll get around
19:10 - to PI spark even in 2020 maybe in 2021
19:14 - but in 2020 I'm kind of focusing I'm
19:18 - gonna finish this panda series and then
19:21 - a lot of people want me to do that
19:22 - machine learning course so I might dive
19:24 - straight in the machine learning now and
19:31 - then I might I want to do a machine
19:34 - learning basics before I get into Python
19:37 - machine learning kind of like whenever I
19:41 - did the matplotlib series and I didn't
19:43 - touch on and I didn't touch on pandas in
19:47 - that series until I had a series on
19:48 - pandas I kind of want to do a machine
19:51 - learning course Quan Python first that's
19:56 - kind of general - any any programming
19:59 - language and then from there I can jump
20:02 - into Python machine learning but yeah PI
20:04 - spark a lot of people have wanted me to
20:08 - do videos on that as well so
20:17 - and I'm kind of taking my cues from you
20:19 - guys here like I said this is a laid
20:21 - back laid back livestream I don't have
20:24 - really any plans for what I'm doing here
20:27 - so if you want to see coding or if
20:29 - you're enjoying just listening to me
20:31 - answer questions then I can do that too
20:33 - so it's it's completely I'm kind of
20:35 - taking my cues from you all so I I
20:38 - didn't really have anything planned out
20:40 - I just know that a lot of people are
20:42 - home right now including myself with
20:45 - everything that's going on so so I just
20:50 - thought I would hop on and this would be
20:51 - kind of a fun thing to do so I see a lot
21:01 - of people that say I've seen several
21:03 - comments so far about switching over to
21:07 - you to me and I've actually I've used
21:10 - you to me for some courses but some of
21:16 - these comments I've used you to me for
21:19 - some courses but all of my stuff is
21:25 - available for free on YouTube and I plan
21:27 - to have it remain free on YouTube I've
21:30 - thought about switching over to you
21:31 - nummy just for people who want add free
21:36 - videos so maybe I could just put all of
21:38 - the same all the same videos that I have
21:42 - on you to YouTube and put those on you
21:44 - to me
21:45 - and and you know just offer those as an
21:50 - ad-free version but everything that I
21:53 - have on youtube or all the content that
21:55 - I have is going to continue to be free
21:58 - into the future so anything that I'd
21:59 - ever do put on you to me it's it's also
22:02 - going to remain on YouTube so don't
22:04 - worry about any paywalls or anything
22:06 - like that
22:11 - what kind of beer are you drinking this
22:14 - is a local beer from Asheville North
22:17 - Carolina and this is called Gaelic ale I
22:21 - think it's kind of like an amber ale or
22:23 - something like that
22:29 - yeah please stick to YouTube is what
22:32 - somebody said yeah I'll definitely like
22:34 - I was saying I'm not going to get off
22:36 - the YouTube platform I'll always be on
22:38 - YouTube and all the videos will remain
22:41 - free if I ever go to another service
22:45 - it'll just be to upload the same free
22:47 - material on to that other service so so
22:50 - yeah don't worry about that can you get
22:56 - rich off of Python programming I saw
23:01 - that I saw that question and then I lost
23:04 - it so I don't know who asked that um
23:07 - well I mean it really depends on mmm it
23:11 - really depends on what you're doing I
23:14 - mean if I was to give somebody career
23:19 - advice I mean I think that computer
23:21 - programming is one of the best careers
23:22 - that you can get into right now I don't
23:24 - know about I've never looked at the
23:27 - standard salaries around the world I
23:30 - know that in the United States it varies
23:32 - a lot on where you're from so if you're
23:34 - in Silicon Valley in California then
23:36 - you're gonna be making you know you're
23:39 - gonna be making a lot more than you
23:41 - would in a state like West Virginia or
23:44 - South Carolina or something like that so
23:46 - it really depends on where you are but
23:48 - but the salaries are definitely good I
23:50 - would say in in California it's probably
23:53 - six figures for sure but they also have
23:56 - extremely high cost of living out there
23:59 - but you know depending on where you are
24:03 - it's it's usually on the higher pay
24:06 - grade compared to other jobs what games
24:11 - are you playing these days I don't I
24:14 - don't play a lot of games I used to play
24:16 - a lot more than I do now right now I'm
24:19 - playing League of Legends a lot so I
24:20 - play League of Legends but that's about
24:22 - the only game that I play any ideas on
24:30 - CI CD so for those who don't know CI CD
24:33 - is continuous integration continuous
24:35 - deployment so it is you know the most
24:40 - popular ones are like Travis CI and
24:42 - Jenkins
24:43 - I think it's great I don't it depends on
24:46 - what your project is it might be
24:48 - overkill for a certain project but if
24:51 - you know CIC D most jobs are using that
24:55 - these days too to handle their projects
24:57 - you can set up pipelines to where
24:59 - whenever you commit your code to a
25:03 - repository it'll automatically run your
25:06 - unit tests and deploy and things like
25:08 - that so it's definitely a good thing to
25:10 - know okay got another super chat here I
25:22 - vote for a little introduction to the
25:25 - machine learning course yet that's a lot
25:28 - of people definitely want that course I
25:30 - I think after the pan discourse I will
25:33 - get started on something like that
25:41 - excuse me
25:42 - try not to burp into the mic bad idea to
25:44 - drink beer on a live stream all favorite
25:49 - youtubers okay yeah that's a great
25:52 - question I actually planned on doing a
25:54 - video about this
25:56 - and I do I am gonna do a video about
25:59 - this in the in the near future but yeah
26:03 - my favorite youtubers I would say Centex
26:07 - Harrison Kinsley over syntaxes channel
26:09 - he's great tech with Tim is really good
26:14 - the good thing about syntax is he just
26:17 - seems like an extremely nice guy like he
26:19 - is just very whenever I was just getting
26:25 - started out I think I probably had you
26:27 - know five thousand subscribers or
26:29 - something like that
26:30 - and he shared a post of mine to all of
26:33 - his subscribers and said hey I found
26:36 - this really good object their morning
26:37 - course by this guy Corey Shaffer and I
26:40 - didn't ask him to do that I never talked
26:42 - to the guy before at all and it was just
26:45 - really cool that that he would do that
26:46 - and whenever I almost had no subscribers
26:50 - at all
26:51 - and I also found tech with Tim through
26:53 - his channel he he had him in his
26:56 - suggested channels on the on the right
26:58 - that he put together so who else who
27:02 - else do I like on YouTube there he
27:06 - doesn't do many videos anymore but if
27:08 - you go back and watch Derek manases old
27:12 - YouTube videos he doesn't do a lot on
27:15 - Python but if you're really trying to
27:17 - get an understanding of computer
27:20 - programming in general he did a he did
27:24 - like a design patterns course using Java
27:26 - and design patterns carry over from
27:29 - language to language so as long as
27:30 - you're learning in one language it'll
27:32 - kind of carry over oh yeah somebody said
27:34 - traversing media I love ya I love Roger
27:37 - see stuff he's he's got some good stuff
27:39 - I don't I've seen that he has a he's
27:43 - more JavaScript oriented from what I can
27:45 - tell but but yeah he has some great I
27:51 - think he has a flass course and some
27:52 - Python stuff as well let me see here let
27:59 - me uh these chats are that's that's one
28:04 - thing I'll have to keep in mind for next
28:05 - time is whenever I did this live stream
28:08 - I thought it would be a few people in
28:10 - here I didn't know that the chats would
28:12 - be going by so quickly so let's see
28:16 - mm-hmm so Piyush Sharma asked can we
28:23 - expect a series on data structures and
28:26 - algorithms using Python and common algo
28:30 - problems I would definitely like to do
28:32 - that that that kind of brings up
28:36 - whenever you asked favorite youtubers
28:38 - that kind of brings up something else is
28:40 - before I do a data structures and
28:43 - algorithms course I would really like to
28:45 - get good with computer animation because
28:49 - I'm not very I've not really used a lot
28:53 - of computer animation libraries and I
28:55 - feel like the best way to learn certain
28:57 - algorithms is to see a good visual
28:59 - representation of these so if you've
29:03 - ever seen what is his name grant
29:05 - Sanderson he goes by the name of three
29:08 - blue one Brown
29:09 - and his videos are awesome he usually
29:11 - does he usually does mathematical
29:13 - related content but he has an
29:16 - open-source Python library that he uses
29:20 - to create those animations so I want to
29:24 - learn how to use that library and if I
29:26 - could do those types of animations then
29:28 - that would really help with those with
29:31 - that algorithms course being able to
29:33 - actually visualize those in a good way
29:39 - okay let me look through some of these
29:41 - other questions here oh yeah real Python
29:44 - somebody mentioned real Python as the
29:46 - YouTube channel the websites already is
29:48 - great that's run by Dan Bader actually
29:50 - met Dan at PyCon two years ago and yeah
29:54 - he's a really good guy I don't know if
29:57 - anybody's aware but PyCon 2020 was
30:00 - cancelled I was going to go to PyCon I
30:04 - actually backed out of Python before
30:07 - they cancelled out the just to just to
30:10 - be safe but then a couple of days later
30:12 - they they cancelled PyCon for goods hmm
30:21 - okay let me look through a couple of
30:23 - these here and I hope you guys don't
30:26 - mind I'm not doing hardly any
30:27 - programming yet you've been basically
30:29 - been looking at a blank screen here I
30:31 - should have planned this a little bit
30:32 - better let me see if if we want to work
30:37 - through some problems we definitely can
30:39 - I didn't realize how many questions I'd
30:42 - be getting so I've been kind of stuck on
30:44 - the questions here for a while
30:47 - but let me see if there's any more
30:49 - pouring in here and then maybe I'll just
30:51 - work through a couple of problems
31:07 - okay and very grateful and appreciative
31:13 - so Jim Shawn I'm very grateful and
31:16 - appreciative that your videos are free
31:17 - used to only make thirteen dollars an
31:20 - hour now I'm actually in the middle of
31:22 - class making six figures congratulations
31:24 - man that's awesome yeah I'm really happy
31:28 - to hear that
31:30 - okay so let's I've been answering gosh I
31:32 - don't even know how long this
31:33 - livestreams been going on for now about
31:36 - 30 minutes Oh a delq I know I know I
31:40 - know this I know this girl that's one of
31:44 - my friends they're great content looking
31:47 - good thank you a dhoka all right so
31:54 - let's let's go through and do a problem
32:00 - here and just kind of work through these
32:02 - problems and also I kind of want to show
32:04 - you guys how you don't have to whenever
32:09 - I do my videos I have everything
32:11 - scripted out so I kind of know exactly
32:15 - what I'm gonna say and when I'm gonna
32:17 - say it and things like that and people
32:20 - always say like Oh in your videos how do
32:22 - you never mess up and how do you always
32:24 - you know it's like you never make
32:26 - mistakes
32:27 - but I make mistakes all the time it's so
32:31 - and then I just edit those out so
32:33 - whenever I'm doing this live you're
32:35 - probably going to see a lot of these
32:36 - mistakes so we can see kind of what that
32:40 - looks like so let's go ahead and work
32:44 - through a couple of problems here on
32:45 - code Wars if nobody knows what code Wars
32:48 - is it's basically a website where you
32:50 - can just get some daily challenges so
32:53 - you hop in and let me go ahead and cover
32:56 - up my chat here because it's distracting
32:58 - me a little bit more than I thought it
33:00 - would and then I will hop in and see
33:02 - your all's chats after I get done
33:05 - solving a problem here
33:08 - so basically you get a daily problem
33:11 - here and a lot of people ask like okay
33:14 - well does this apply to real
33:16 - programming when I do these types of
33:17 - problems that's kind of a hard question
33:21 - I mean this isn't going to make you an
33:23 - excellent programmer by any means but
33:26 - it's one of those things that you can do
33:28 - just to kind of you know get the syntax
33:34 - down and to you know kind of keep fresh
33:40 - with with whatever language you're using
33:42 - they have problems and Python they have
33:45 - JavaScript C++ c-sharp
33:47 - all kinds of different things and it's
33:49 - usually you know some short solution so
33:52 - let's just work through one of these
33:53 - problems and see what this looks like
33:55 - and they also have these sample tests
33:57 - down here so that whenever you run the
33:59 - test it'll tell you if you got the
34:01 - problem right so you don't have to write
34:03 - your own unit tests or anything like
34:05 - that and I've not seen this problem yet
34:08 - so this is new to me and I'm not very
34:10 - good at these types of problem so you
34:12 - guys in the chat might have to help me
34:14 - out but let's see here so it says write
34:17 - a function that takes an array of
34:19 - strings as an argument and returns a
34:22 - sorted array containing the same strings
34:24 - ordered from shortest to longest so for
34:29 - example if we get this array where were
34:32 - your past an argument of this string
34:34 - here then the function would return so
34:37 - let me actually post this and sublime so
34:39 - that you guys can see a little bit
34:40 - better I know that the screen is a
34:42 - little small here but I'll just leave a
34:45 - comment here so let's say that we got
34:47 - this as an input this list here and we
34:52 - want to return or we want to write a
34:53 - function that will return that list
34:56 - sorted to where it looks like this so
35:01 - they are sorted by length of characters
35:03 - I think is what it's asking for all the
35:07 - strings in the array pasts your function
35:09 - will be different links so you not have
35:12 - to decide how to order multiple strings
35:14 - of the same length okay so from here the
35:21 - way that I would solve this we can write
35:23 - a custom sorting function and this is
35:27 - another thing that a lot of people ask a
35:30 - lot
35:30 - people always ask like how do you
35:32 - remember everything that you write down
35:34 - in your video well I really don't
35:36 - remember everything from the video like
35:38 - I said I have scripts for the videos so
35:40 - something like this you know this can be
35:45 - something where I need to search like
35:47 - okay list or Python Python list custom
35:54 - sort something like that and then I can
35:58 - go to the Python documentation or a
36:00 - stack overflow question here and I can
36:02 - see how to pass in a function to the
36:06 - sort argument so we can see here that we
36:10 - have a list dot sort and we can pass in
36:13 - the key so if you forgot that syntax
36:15 - then that's how you would do it so how I
36:18 - would do this problem here let's see if
36:20 - we get this right so I have just this
36:22 - custom Python script open here so I'm
36:25 - just gonna call this you know code Wars
36:29 - func and we're gonna take in a list as
36:33 - an argument and now what I want to do
36:37 - with this list is let me create another
36:42 - function up here let's say you know sort
36:48 - by Lynn and we will take in let's see
36:54 - how do we want to do this actually I
37:00 - don't even need to do this all I can do
37:04 - is I can just return L that's sorted and
37:10 - then I can pass in a lambda function and
37:13 - for those who don't know a lambda
37:15 - function is basically just a throwaway
37:16 - function I can just pass the lambda
37:19 - function here and I believe that I can
37:22 - just return by the length of X let's see
37:26 - if this works let me try this might not
37:30 - work you guys are also seeing the code
37:36 - after a few drinks here so hopefully
37:40 - this may not have been the best idea
37:44 - let me go ahead and copy that return
37:46 - statement here and let's test this see
37:52 - what we get
37:54 - L is not defined okay I have to pass
37:57 - this in they were taking it as a ray I'm
37:59 - gonna take it in as L has no object
38:08 - sorted sort see this is my problem here
38:20 - so people say I don't make mistakes and
38:22 - videos and now you can see how many
38:25 - mistakes I'm actually making so yeah we
38:28 - want to set the key equal to that lambda
38:30 - function so let me go back here
38:43 - okay so why wouldn't this work so now
38:47 - whenever I'm working in something like
38:48 - code wars if I don't get it to work then
38:52 - I'll just take the function here and I
38:55 - will paste it into my sublime text and
39:00 - now let's just try to run this function
39:02 - and pass in their sample input and see
39:08 - what we get so I'm going to do a sort by
39:10 - length pass in this list here I'm going
39:13 - to set this equal to L and then I'll
39:15 - print out the return the list okay so we
39:22 - get none okay so let's try this here
39:30 - let's do result is equal to sorted L key
39:44 - is equal to this okay so this might be
39:55 - what we need here so we have the sorted
39:57 - function so when we did L dot sort what
40:03 - it does is it actually sorts the list in
40:04 - place but it doesn't return a sorted
40:06 - list so when we actually capture this as
40:10 - a variable using sorted then this should
40:12 - work
40:12 - so now let me take this back to code
40:15 - Wars here and let's see if this works
40:18 - instead okay
40:23 - so it looks like all of our tests pass
40:24 - and if I hit enter here then the good
40:27 - thing about code Wars is that once you
40:30 - get the right result so we did get the
40:33 - right result here and all of our tests
40:34 - pass if I submit this then I haven't
40:38 - done code words in a long time
40:40 - but it should take me to a page here
40:42 - where I can see everybody else's top
40:46 - submissions and so then we can see all
40:51 - the other submissions that were uploaded
40:54 - and
40:57 - the most what the best practices were
40:59 - and whether they have a clever ranking
41:03 - and they have a best practice ranking so
41:06 - we can see here that this is pretty
41:07 - similar to what we did they returned a
41:09 - sorted array with the key oh ok so see
41:13 - they just set the key equal to Lin which
41:15 - so that was kind of bad practice what I
41:18 - did by passing in that lambda function
41:20 - we didn't even need the lambda function
41:22 - because there's already a length
41:24 - function so that's the kind of stuff
41:25 - that whenever you make those small
41:27 - mistakes and then you see how somebody
41:29 - else did it you can just say like I knew
41:32 - that of course but but yeah it can make
41:35 - you feel dumb sometimes when you see
41:37 - other people's submissions but that's
41:41 - kind of what you can do with code words
41:43 - there so now let me jump back to the
41:46 - chat and see how many people are making
41:47 - in front of me for for how bad I'm doing
41:50 - on these projects here what's the name
41:57 - of this practice exercise so this one
42:00 - was called sort array by string length
42:05 - and let's look at some of these other
42:08 - questions while I was while I was doing
42:10 - that
42:18 - okay so somebody else left a super chat
42:21 - here they said coding coding game.com
42:26 - word / start is another good site for
42:29 - working on problems while making it more
42:32 - fun I've never used that but if anybody
42:34 - wants to give that a shot they can
42:37 - mm-hmm
42:41 - TJ Durkin said I'm stuck on database
42:43 - best practices after refactoring to app
42:48 - factories can we get an SQL light my
42:52 - sequel QuickStart I do have a video on
42:56 - sequel light using Python but I haven't
43:02 - done I haven't jumped into a pack
43:05 - thérèse yet so I think I started to
43:10 - touch on app factories at the end of the
43:12 - flash series but yeah if that's
43:15 - something that that people want to know
43:17 - more about them we can take a look at
43:19 - that as well let me see if I missed any
43:22 - other chats up here
43:31 - love the accent thank you it's pretty
43:35 - thick yeah like I said I grew up in West
43:37 - Virginia so I have a thick southern
43:40 - American accent why Python 3 4 I'm
43:51 - actually on my on my machine I'm
43:54 - probably using what am I using here on
43:58 - my machine I'm probably using 3 7
44:06 - so yeah I'm using 3 7 on my machine I
44:09 - need to download 3 8 but it looks like
44:14 - on code worse they're still using 3 4
44:16 - I'm not sure why they are maybe it just
44:18 - takes them a while to update that on the
44:21 - website or maybe they had 3 7 then I
44:25 - just didn't see it I could have done a
44:27 - drop-down or something
44:37 - do I use code words often I don't use
44:41 - code words often anymore I used to a lot
44:44 - it was a nice daily exercise for me to
44:47 - kind of try to solve problems on my own
44:50 - and to see I I think the best thing
44:53 - about code Wars is seeing other people's
44:56 - respond or other people's solutions to
44:59 - the problems that you just work through
45:02 - because just like just like I just
45:04 - showed I use that lambda where I
45:07 - returned the length of that list but I
45:10 - could have just set that key equal to
45:12 - the Ling to the length function and that
45:14 - would have been even easier and even
45:17 - better so yeah a lot of you got the
45:26 - answer to that question long before I
45:29 - did like I said I'm not great at those
45:31 - on-the-spot programming questions you
45:35 - guys should see me in a job interview
45:36 - it's you can ask me the easiest question
45:39 - and I will freeze up when I know people
45:41 - are watching
45:53 - you code better after beers I don't know
45:56 - about that I think I'm I think I might
45:59 - be proving that wrong here somebody said
46:14 - how about data science videos so I am
46:17 - starting on data science videos if
46:20 - you've watched my last videos I've been
46:25 - doing pandas videos and that's you use
46:28 - pretty heavily in the data science world
46:30 - and I'm going to continue with the data
46:34 - with the data science series I'll
46:38 - probably have three or four videos left
46:40 - on pandas and then I'm gonna take a
46:44 - little bit of a break and but that
46:47 - doesn't mean that the series is over
46:48 - there's still a lot to cover so in the
46:50 - next couple of videos on pandas is going
46:52 - to be our you know is going to be how to
46:56 - load in data from multiple different
46:58 - sources how to read in data from
47:00 - multiple different sources like SQL JSON
47:05 - files Excel files and things like that
47:08 - and then after that I'll probably take a
47:10 - break and start doing some one-off
47:12 - videos for a while but then I'll come
47:13 - back to pandas to touch on some topics
47:15 - that people have requested you know like
47:18 - how to merge data frames and how to do
47:21 - pivot tables and pandas and things like
47:23 - that so where is my dog my dog is
47:32 - currently out of town so I went to
47:35 - Canada a few weeks ago it was actually
47:39 - right before
47:41 - gosh how long ago was that it was
47:42 - probably about a month ago it was right
47:44 - before all this virus stuff became you
47:48 - know became very serious and to where
47:50 - people shouldn't travel anymore so it
47:54 - was right before that so it was there
47:57 - were kind of talks of that virus
48:00 - spreading in certain areas but I don't
48:03 - think there were any confirmed cases
48:04 - the United States at that time so but it
48:09 - was yeah it was a strange experience so
48:12 - when I went to Canada
48:12 - I dropped my dog off at my parents place
48:15 - and and I haven't picked him up yet but
48:18 - I'll probably go and pick him up next
48:19 - week now that's something that a lot of
48:25 - people wanted me to make a video on as
48:28 - well whenever I went up to Canada I
48:30 - visited a I visited a quantum computing
48:36 - company and that was a deep wave deep
48:41 - wave is the name of that company and I
48:43 - don't know anything really about quantum
48:46 - computing it was a totally new
48:47 - experience for me so I was kind of going
48:50 - in completely blind not understanding
48:52 - how this stuff works at all and and I
48:55 - would like to say that I learned a lot
48:57 - while I was there and I think I did
48:59 - learn a lot while I was there but that
49:00 - stuff it still is absolutely
49:02 - mind-blowing to me that they actually
49:03 - have these things working and running
49:07 - like I didn't I thought that this stuff
49:08 - was still hypothetical but deep wave if
49:12 - I do do a video on that experience some
49:15 - time then I'll show you their online
49:17 - platform they actually have a service
49:20 - where you can get on and you can run
49:23 - some of your code on their quantum
49:25 - computers and get results back
49:27 - I think there that service is called
49:30 - leap through deep wave and that was in
49:32 - Burnaby Canada it's it's close to
49:35 - Vancouver
49:48 - let's see here let's see if what other
49:52 - questions we have what kind of music do
49:55 - you like and play gosh can okay so yeah
50:01 - you can see my I got my guitar in my
50:04 - banjo in the background there but that's
50:05 - kind of a that's kind of a lie because I
50:09 - don't I'm not good at playing music I
50:12 - just I want to get good at playing music
50:15 - but I I listen to a lot of folk music so
50:18 - I like folk Americana style Avett
50:21 - Brothers Mumford & Sons Lumineers bands
50:24 - like that but I can't really play I'd
50:28 - like to I'd like to learn at some point
50:30 - in the future I saw your face for the
50:38 - first time okay well yeah the I did I've
50:40 - only had one video previously where I
50:42 - actually showed my face so yeah I don't
50:45 - do it a lot I don't like having the
50:47 - webcam on I feel like it's it can be
50:48 - distracting in most videos I just like I
50:52 - just like people being able to see the
50:54 - code so yeah this is this is kind of new
50:57 - new for me as well but in the last video
51:00 - I did I had short hair so I've grown out
51:02 - the hair since then and let's see
51:09 - somebody asked so we have one super chat
51:17 - I just want to thank you and a year and
51:19 - a half
51:20 - thanks to you and syntax I went from
51:22 - zero to senior D s I don't have enough
51:27 - words thank you
51:28 - well yeah man that's I'm glad to hear
51:31 - that that's yeah I love getting messages
51:34 - like that it's one of my favorite things
51:36 - to wake up to is to get messages from
51:38 - people that say that the videos have
51:40 - helped them out in some way so yeah I
51:42 - really appreciate that and thank you for
51:43 - the message I thought you were younger
51:49 - yeah I probably need to change my avatar
51:51 - that's probably my fault that avatar
51:54 - that I have for the YouTube channel is
51:58 - pretty old it's probably about ten years
52:00 - old so I hardly ever take pictures so
52:11 - how do you make your videos uh I've
52:18 - thought about I've thought about doing a
52:20 - video on this as well I use basically it
52:25 - kind of depends it depends on who you
52:27 - are some people were very good at just
52:28 - being able to get on and talk off the
52:31 - cuff and teach whatever they need to
52:33 - teach I'm better when I go off of the
52:35 - script so you guys can probably tell you
52:38 - know this being my first live stream I
52:40 - probably sound a lot different and trip
52:43 - over my words a lot more than I do in
52:45 - the videos and that's because in the
52:47 - videos I write scripts and that takes
52:50 - about probably 95% of the time to write
52:54 - the scripts so I'll write the scripts
52:55 - for the videos I have all my bullet
52:57 - points I know exactly what I want to say
53:00 - what coding examples I want to show and
53:02 - then after I get those scripts done I
53:05 - will use Camtasia to record the videos
53:10 - and then I edit in Camtasia and Camtasia
53:14 - as well
53:21 - have I been to India I've never been to
53:24 - India actually I actually didn't start
53:26 - traveling until recently after i whent
53:30 - full time in youtube I've really only
53:33 - been out of the United States a handful
53:35 - of times I would love to come over to
53:36 - India it would be a be a nice trip the
53:40 - places that I have travelled have been
53:44 - I've been to Mexico a few times I went
53:48 - to Dubai for a work trip whenever I was
53:50 - out in Boulder I worked for the
53:52 - laboratory for atmospheric and space
53:55 - physics and we had a Mars mission with
53:57 - Dubai and the Mars mission was being
54:02 - worked on by the Mohammed bin Rashid
54:05 - Space Center and we went over to Dubai
54:08 - to visit that Space Centre and kind of
54:10 - train their team and get to work with
54:13 - their team that was a lot of fun and
54:17 - then recently after I quit my job in
54:21 - went full-time I went down to Peru but
54:23 - yeah I'd like to do a lot more traveling
54:25 - I've not done a lot of traveling outside
54:27 - the United States do I have a wife I do
54:31 - not have a wife I'm not married
54:39 - how was Boulder Boulder is a great town
54:42 - I loved it out in Boulder it was a
54:45 - beautiful area it was just kind of high
54:48 - cost of living so it's a very expensive
54:50 - place to live and it just didn't make as
54:52 - much sense for me anymore now that I'm
54:55 - working from home to live in such a
54:57 - high-cost area so I could get a lot more
55:00 - bang for my buck and where I'm living
55:02 - now and I was able to get a little bit
55:05 - more land for for the dog to run around
55:08 - and stuff out here so so I decided to
55:11 - move back
55:20 - okay so how long have we been going here
55:23 - we've been going for almost an hour now
55:26 - and so like I said I didn't have any
55:29 - plans for this for this live stream
55:32 - whenever I came on I just wanted to you
55:35 - know just to kind of see what you guys
55:39 - were up to and I know that a lot of us
55:42 - are home so I just wanted to get on and
55:44 - do something that might be a little bit
55:46 - fun and answer some questions and maybe
55:48 - do a coding problem but let me know what
55:53 - you guys think about this like I said
55:54 - this is my first live stream
55:56 - I'm completely new to this I probably
55:59 - tripped over over my words a lot and I
56:02 - spent most the time answering questions
56:04 - I planned on doing some more coding but
56:06 - I didn't realize how many people would
56:07 - actually be here writing questions so
56:13 - since we're coming up on an hour let's
56:16 - say yeah I'll probably stop the stream
56:19 - at about 3:30 and then just do an
56:22 - hour-long stream and if you guys liked
56:24 - this then we can do more of this and if
56:27 - you hated it then you can just say hey
56:29 - go back to 2:00 and go back to doing
56:32 - normal videos and only do those very you
56:35 - know only do the live streams very
56:36 - rarely so so it's up to you guys really
56:39 - I just want to uh it's it's something we
56:42 - can do more of if you like it it's it's
56:45 - but also the main focus is always going
56:49 - to be the tutorials the the normal
56:51 - tutorials that we do let me read a
56:55 - couple more questions here and then
56:56 - we'll so we'll spend about two more
56:58 - minutes answering questions I'm sorry I
56:59 - didn't do more coding problems but like
57:02 - I said there were just a lot more
57:05 - questions than what I initially thought
57:07 - I thought I'd be answering like two or
57:08 - three questions and then doing mostly
57:11 - coding but we have a lot of questions
57:13 - here so how did I choose Python well I
57:18 - didn't really choose Python I'm glad
57:21 - that I learned Python though it's my
57:22 - favorite language now that I'm using it
57:24 - so like I said I was a full-time
57:26 - JavaScript developer and after I had to
57:33 - do a back-end
57:34 - Python web service once and I learned
57:36 - Python to create that web service and
57:38 - after I wrote that I kind of fell in
57:40 - love with that I was like man this is so
57:42 - much easier than you know what I've been
57:44 - using before which was Java and
57:46 - JavaScript so after that I really
57:50 - enjoyed it wanted to learn more and I
57:51 - wanted to do it full-time so I started
57:53 - looking for full-time Python jobs okay
58:07 - all right let's say I'll answer one more
58:10 - question here and then then let's in the
58:13 - live stream for now and if you guys want
58:16 - to do more like this then we can in the
58:18 - future I'll probably be less nervous
58:21 - than now that I've got the first one out
58:22 - of the way let's see here so do I one
58:29 - question was do I plan to do more with
58:31 - the Django and flask series it's been a
58:33 - while since I have have put out videos
58:37 - on the Django and flash series now I
58:40 - definitely do want to do more with the
58:42 - Django and flash series but I think what
58:44 - I'm gonna do is instead of adding to
58:47 - those existing tutorials I think what
58:50 - I'm going to do is I'm just going to
58:51 - completely revamp the series and I'm
58:54 - gonna do flasks from scratch and I'm
58:56 - gonna do Django from scratch and I'll
58:58 - probably build a similar application but
59:01 - I'm just going to add more to the
59:03 - application so so some things that
59:06 - weren't added to the first Django series
59:08 - or the first flash series that I would
59:10 - like to add to the to the next series
59:12 - that I do on those are going to be
59:15 - things like two-factor authentication
59:17 - how to you know a lot of people want me
59:21 - to show how to add pictures and comments
59:25 - to different posts and things like that
59:27 - so we could take that application and we
59:30 - could make it a lot larger than it is
59:33 - now with a lot more functionality and
59:35 - teach you guys a lot more so that so
59:38 - that's something that we can definitely
59:40 - do with that series and I will do that
59:42 - for both flask and Django but those
59:44 - those should take a while to put
59:46 - together but not too
59:47 - because I'm probably just gonna use the
59:49 - same the same building blocks of the
59:53 - application that we built before and
59:54 - just add to that with those extra
59:56 - features and you guys can always send me
59:59 - the features that you'd like to see
60:01 - added we can do two-factor
60:03 - authentication images and comment
60:08 - section and things like that as well all
60:11 - right well I think that is going to be
60:13 - it I really appreciate you guys tuning
60:16 - in and asking all these questions I know
60:19 - that it's not
60:21 - hopefully that it hopefully you guys had
60:23 - a good time hanging out and asking
60:26 - questions and and just you know talking
60:31 - back and forth I hope you guys are all
60:32 - staying safe I know that it's crazy
60:34 - times going on right now it's it's wild
60:40 - it's wild what's happening and I hope
60:44 - you guys are all staying inside and
60:45 - doing the social distancing protocols
60:49 - that are in place everywhere so but yeah
60:52 - you guys stay safe stay out of crowded
60:55 - areas and I will talk to you guys soon
60:59 - if you guys enjoyed this again just let
61:01 - me know we can always do more all right
61:05 - thank you guys so much and I will see
61:08 - you soon

Cleaned transcript:

okay did that do it all right can everybody hear me okay sometimes I have problems with this microphone where you can only hear from one side so hopefully you can hear from both sides of the alright okay so hopefully this is working I know that a lot of us are stuck in our homes right now with everything going on so I figured I just hop on and we could just chat and have just a laidback kind of session and maybe do some coding maybe answer some questions and things like that I've got a couple of drinks here so I can have some drinks while we're doing some coding might not be the best idea but so what would you guys like to see this is my first live stream that I've ever had so we could just have a Q&A and I could kind of read the chats back and forth for a little bit and answer some questions or I could just jump in and start start doing some code worst problems for you guys we can kind of do a mix of both comments are coming in pretty quick I didn't expect this well thank you guys yeah okay so it looks like some people want to do kind of like a QA at the beginning I've never I've did a Q&A video a long time ago and call somebody send a super chat thank you for all the Python videos thank you for that so I did a Q&A a long time ago I think that's back when I had gosh it was probably I don't know five thousand subscribers or something it's been several years since I've done one so yeah let's go ahead and answer a few common questions here okay somebody asked vs code versus sublime text so it really depends on what you want to do I'd say a lot of you have probably noticed that I use sublime text in my videos but the reason that I use sublime text in my videos is mainly because it is very minimalist and it just lets you see the code and the output without anything else getting in the way so I used that for the videos so that people can see when I'm doing without all this other stuff kind of taking up their peripheral vision but vs code is a very good editor I have a video on how to set that up as well so whenever I'm actually working on projects I will use vs code to actually work on projects because that way I get access to the debugger I get access to the I get access to being able to jump into the code and things like that and seeing all the packages that I have installed so I actually like the s code more for actually working on projects but I use sublime text for kind of daytoday coding just being able to do things like that I also have a couple of questions here thank you for pandas and Jango series oh you're welcome I'm glad that you like those that is from Alpha Umar Diallo thank you I also have some questions here that I have pulled up excuse me and these are some common questions that I have that I just wrote down before we started the livestream just in case I didn't get too many questions pulling in from the chat but I also answer some questions from the chat as well but a lot of people just ask me you know what is your fulltime job or what do you do fulltime so recently now I'm actually doing YouTube fulltime so before I was doing YouTube fulltime I've had several different jobs I worked in I grew up in West Virginia and I lived in West Virginia for most of my life and always worked at universities and I used to work at a GIS lab and that's where I actually started or I worked at gs GIS lab at West Virginia University and that's actually where I first started using Python before that I was a JavaScript developer fulltime and then I started using some Python scripts on the back end and that was probably that's around the time that I started making my videos like my very first videos which will probably I don't know about six years ago now or something like that that's when I was basically just getting into Python and I was making the videos just so that I could learn personally and and it kind of grew from there and then I moved out to Boulder Colorado and got a fulltime job in Python doing some flash web development on the back end and then we also did a lot of system and sorry this is my first this is my first live stream and I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually if you guys like this kind of video then I can do more of these but it's it's kind of I'm getting used to talking and seeing all the chats coming in at the same time so it's so if I get distracted then sorry about that but yeah so I was mainly working in flash development doing some backend web services and then moved on to do some more system administration stuff with using things like ansible and then after I did went YouTube for full time that's been over a year now I ended up moving back east and moving to Greenville South Carolina where I live now so and now I'm just doing Utah YouTube's fulltime here and putting courses together okay let me check some of these super chats I don't want to miss any of these just to make sure I answer any questions that are coming in here because it's so hard to thank you all for the Python and Django videos thank you thank you for helping me understand higherorder functions closures and decorators keep up the good work I'm glad you guys enjoy those so another question that I get a lot is people ask me a best way to prepare a portfolio so this is kind of a difficult question because it really depends it really depends on the the job that you're going for but I would always say that the best way to prepare a portfolio I've said this a couple of times when people ask me this question is I think the best thing you can do if you're preparing for a job or trying to get a job is to make a website with all of your let make a personal website and it depends on the time frame as well so if you were a time frame for getting a new job is within the next you know a few weeks or months and you don't have time to build a website from scratch then there's nothing wrong with those services that just allowed you allow you to easily build a website like you know what are some of the services like wicks or Squarespace or something like that or something like WordPress but whenever I say to build a website for your portfolio what I think the best thing to do in the long term is to go in with something like flask or like Django if you're a Python developer and take what you have learned there and it's going to expose you to so many other technologies as well so you're going to learn Python because you're going to be building a website in flask or you were going to be building the website and Django and from there you're going to have to host the website so you're going to get a hosting service either like Heroku or like the node or something like that and you're it's most likely going to be a Linux server of some kind so you're going to get some linux experience and some system and administration experience by logging into that and and doing you know setting up security and setting up things like that you're going to learn SQL and databases if your website has a database so making a website will really expose you to kind of all the different areas that you can learn and that will be and that's something that's going to be really valuable to employers whenever they see that on your portfolio so that's always my recommendation if somebody doesn't have anything and they're just looking for something eyecatching that they can show to somebody then I always recommend you know making a website ok let me grab another beer here so let's see I grabbed a bunch of local beer as well whenever I went in the town so alright I'll take this one this one is from Asheville North Carolina Gaelic ale so let's try this out ok let me catch up on some of these questions here these are scrolling back past pretty quickly ok well you do a series on machine learning yes I definitely want to do a machine learning series mmm it people ask me this a lot now the reason that I haven't put together a series on machine learning yet is just because it is such a large topic to cover so it is something that I'm a bit intimidated to kind of tackle because when I do a series like the Panda series that I'm working on now you know I've probably been working on that series now for about four months or something like that so and that's gonna be that's not going to be as large of a topic as machine learning so I just know that it's going to take a lot of time but I know that a lot of people are looking for that so I will start working on something like that here soon but it's definitely gonna be a big commitment so I've been a little slow to to do that but I know that a lot of people want that so I will start working on a machine learning course here in the near future okay let's see best websites to learn a w s gosh I would say that the best websites learn AWS I did a little bit of AWS training back whenever I was at my last job and I think that Amazon as far as I could tell Amazon had the best training for AWS on their own personal websites AWS is a hard thing to it's a hard thing to teach and it's a hard thing to make tutorials about because they are adding so much so often I think they're starting to kind of settle on some things that won't be changed too often now but whenever it first came out there were just you know hundreds of services being added on you it seemed like every year there were hundreds of new services so let's see here okay more about machine learning what is your age I'm 33 years old Oh is flasks better than Django okay so this is a question that I get a lot especially since I've done a video on for a series on flask and a series on Django in my opinion there isn't one that is better it just depends on what you are doing so flask is what they call a micro framework so flask is you I use flask a lot because I usually don't need all the bells and whistles of Django but Django comes builtin so flask will give you hardly any functionality out of the box and you can come up with a complete website with just one file that's all you need but Django is kind of intimidating for beginners because you download it and you're handed this entire directory with all these different things and it's kind of hard to you know to look at that and to know even where to start but it comes with so much out of the box you have an admin panel where you can create users and things like that so it depends on what you're doing if you need a very simple website like say that you're making a static website generator or something like that then I would definitely recommend flask for that but something like Django if you need an entire user system then it's probably better to go with Django since that comes with all that out of the box and people have put in so much work in making these secure user systems and that's just a bunch of code that you don't have to rewrite yourself so I would recommend a Django for those applications where you want all that outofthebox functionality and I would recommend flask for simpler websites quarry you coughed I'll probably be coughing a lot it probably wasn't a great idea to drink beers on stream whenever I have my mic right in my mouth and I'm sure I'm gonna be burping a lot as well so but I'll try to cover up the mic when I do that so I don't curse you guys out okay let's see what else we got here do you have a CS degree yes I went to I have a computer science degree I went to Marshall University in Huntington West Virginia and I got my computer science degree from there okay let's see and if we run out of questions here then I can go ahead and just start coding up some sample problems and you guys can kind of watch as I solve some problems here or try to solve some problems okay from our June hopefully I don't if I mess up these names I'm very sorry but it looks like our June said Cory thanks for being an inspiration I'm a developer now after starting to learn from you do more videos like react and flask and come to human you too me too okay yeah I've heard a lot about react I actually haven't used react personally but I haven't seen a big demand for that lately it's been a long time since I've got dope back into the JavaScript world back when I did JavaScript full time that was before es6 even came out so that was probably I think the biggest framework back then was probably ember j/s I don't even know if that's if people still use ember or not but that was before angular and all that stuff so it's been a while since I've done JavaScript coding but I do know that a lot of people have told me to do react in flask so that would be that would be a fun series to do will I do a web scraping series well I've put together several web scraping videos already so I have one on beautifulsoup and I have one on requests HTML and requests HTML was written by the same person who wrote the request library Kenneth rights and but those are kind of the basics of web scraping if you want me to do something more indepth like you know maybe crawling some dynamic sites that have JavaScript and things like that then yeah I could use a framework like scrapy or mechanize or something like that we could definitely put together a series like that and the same thing with async io that's kind of the same thing that I was talking about with the machine learning is I definitely want to do an async IO course but it's something that's kind of a large topic that a lot of people that I just know will take me a while to put together so I've been a little hesitant to do that because sometimes I get burned out on these courses like this pandas courses has taken a long time and I'm getting getting to the end of that course now and I'm getting you know a little burn out on pandas but after I put out these next couple of videos then I'm probably going to take a break from pandas for a while and then go back to someone off videos and and go from there and but yeah async is definitely on the list of stuff to cover okay any plans for a PI spark development series in the future well it's not in the immediate future I've had a lot of people that have asked about that so I definitely have it written down but probably I don't know if I'll get around to PI spark even in 2020 maybe in 2021 but in 2020 I'm kind of focusing I'm gonna finish this panda series and then a lot of people want me to do that machine learning course so I might dive straight in the machine learning now and then I might I want to do a machine learning basics before I get into Python machine learning kind of like whenever I did the matplotlib series and I didn't touch on and I didn't touch on pandas in that series until I had a series on pandas I kind of want to do a machine learning course Quan Python first that's kind of general any any programming language and then from there I can jump into Python machine learning but yeah PI spark a lot of people have wanted me to do videos on that as well so and I'm kind of taking my cues from you guys here like I said this is a laid back laid back livestream I don't have really any plans for what I'm doing here so if you want to see coding or if you're enjoying just listening to me answer questions then I can do that too so it's it's completely I'm kind of taking my cues from you all so I I didn't really have anything planned out I just know that a lot of people are home right now including myself with everything that's going on so so I just thought I would hop on and this would be kind of a fun thing to do so I see a lot of people that say I've seen several comments so far about switching over to you to me and I've actually I've used you to me for some courses but some of these comments I've used you to me for some courses but all of my stuff is available for free on YouTube and I plan to have it remain free on YouTube I've thought about switching over to you nummy just for people who want add free videos so maybe I could just put all of the same all the same videos that I have on you to YouTube and put those on you to me and and you know just offer those as an adfree version but everything that I have on youtube or all the content that I have is going to continue to be free into the future so anything that I'd ever do put on you to me it's it's also going to remain on YouTube so don't worry about any paywalls or anything like that what kind of beer are you drinking this is a local beer from Asheville North Carolina and this is called Gaelic ale I think it's kind of like an amber ale or something like that yeah please stick to YouTube is what somebody said yeah I'll definitely like I was saying I'm not going to get off the YouTube platform I'll always be on YouTube and all the videos will remain free if I ever go to another service it'll just be to upload the same free material on to that other service so so yeah don't worry about that can you get rich off of Python programming I saw that I saw that question and then I lost it so I don't know who asked that um well I mean it really depends on mmm it really depends on what you're doing I mean if I was to give somebody career advice I mean I think that computer programming is one of the best careers that you can get into right now I don't know about I've never looked at the standard salaries around the world I know that in the United States it varies a lot on where you're from so if you're in Silicon Valley in California then you're gonna be making you know you're gonna be making a lot more than you would in a state like West Virginia or South Carolina or something like that so it really depends on where you are but but the salaries are definitely good I would say in in California it's probably six figures for sure but they also have extremely high cost of living out there but you know depending on where you are it's it's usually on the higher pay grade compared to other jobs what games are you playing these days I don't I don't play a lot of games I used to play a lot more than I do now right now I'm playing League of Legends a lot so I play League of Legends but that's about the only game that I play any ideas on CI CD so for those who don't know CI CD is continuous integration continuous deployment so it is you know the most popular ones are like Travis CI and Jenkins I think it's great I don't it depends on what your project is it might be overkill for a certain project but if you know CIC D most jobs are using that these days too to handle their projects you can set up pipelines to where whenever you commit your code to a repository it'll automatically run your unit tests and deploy and things like that so it's definitely a good thing to know okay got another super chat here I vote for a little introduction to the machine learning course yet that's a lot of people definitely want that course I I think after the pan discourse I will get started on something like that excuse me try not to burp into the mic bad idea to drink beer on a live stream all favorite youtubers okay yeah that's a great question I actually planned on doing a video about this and I do I am gonna do a video about this in the in the near future but yeah my favorite youtubers I would say Centex Harrison Kinsley over syntaxes channel he's great tech with Tim is really good the good thing about syntax is he just seems like an extremely nice guy like he is just very whenever I was just getting started out I think I probably had you know five thousand subscribers or something like that and he shared a post of mine to all of his subscribers and said hey I found this really good object their morning course by this guy Corey Shaffer and I didn't ask him to do that I never talked to the guy before at all and it was just really cool that that he would do that and whenever I almost had no subscribers at all and I also found tech with Tim through his channel he he had him in his suggested channels on the on the right that he put together so who else who else do I like on YouTube there he doesn't do many videos anymore but if you go back and watch Derek manases old YouTube videos he doesn't do a lot on Python but if you're really trying to get an understanding of computer programming in general he did a he did like a design patterns course using Java and design patterns carry over from language to language so as long as you're learning in one language it'll kind of carry over oh yeah somebody said traversing media I love ya I love Roger see stuff he's he's got some good stuff I don't I've seen that he has a he's more JavaScript oriented from what I can tell but but yeah he has some great I think he has a flass course and some Python stuff as well let me see here let me uh these chats are that's that's one thing I'll have to keep in mind for next time is whenever I did this live stream I thought it would be a few people in here I didn't know that the chats would be going by so quickly so let's see mmhmm so Piyush Sharma asked can we expect a series on data structures and algorithms using Python and common algo problems I would definitely like to do that that that kind of brings up whenever you asked favorite youtubers that kind of brings up something else is before I do a data structures and algorithms course I would really like to get good with computer animation because I'm not very I've not really used a lot of computer animation libraries and I feel like the best way to learn certain algorithms is to see a good visual representation of these so if you've ever seen what is his name grant Sanderson he goes by the name of three blue one Brown and his videos are awesome he usually does he usually does mathematical related content but he has an opensource Python library that he uses to create those animations so I want to learn how to use that library and if I could do those types of animations then that would really help with those with that algorithms course being able to actually visualize those in a good way okay let me look through some of these other questions here oh yeah real Python somebody mentioned real Python as the YouTube channel the websites already is great that's run by Dan Bader actually met Dan at PyCon two years ago and yeah he's a really good guy I don't know if anybody's aware but PyCon 2020 was cancelled I was going to go to PyCon I actually backed out of Python before they cancelled out the just to just to be safe but then a couple of days later they they cancelled PyCon for goods hmm okay let me look through a couple of these here and I hope you guys don't mind I'm not doing hardly any programming yet you've been basically been looking at a blank screen here I should have planned this a little bit better let me see if if we want to work through some problems we definitely can I didn't realize how many questions I'd be getting so I've been kind of stuck on the questions here for a while but let me see if there's any more pouring in here and then maybe I'll just work through a couple of problems okay and very grateful and appreciative so Jim Shawn I'm very grateful and appreciative that your videos are free used to only make thirteen dollars an hour now I'm actually in the middle of class making six figures congratulations man that's awesome yeah I'm really happy to hear that okay so let's I've been answering gosh I don't even know how long this livestreams been going on for now about 30 minutes Oh a delq I know I know I know this I know this girl that's one of my friends they're great content looking good thank you a dhoka all right so let's let's go through and do a problem here and just kind of work through these problems and also I kind of want to show you guys how you don't have to whenever I do my videos I have everything scripted out so I kind of know exactly what I'm gonna say and when I'm gonna say it and things like that and people always say like Oh in your videos how do you never mess up and how do you always you know it's like you never make mistakes but I make mistakes all the time it's so and then I just edit those out so whenever I'm doing this live you're probably going to see a lot of these mistakes so we can see kind of what that looks like so let's go ahead and work through a couple of problems here on code Wars if nobody knows what code Wars is it's basically a website where you can just get some daily challenges so you hop in and let me go ahead and cover up my chat here because it's distracting me a little bit more than I thought it would and then I will hop in and see your all's chats after I get done solving a problem here so basically you get a daily problem here and a lot of people ask like okay well does this apply to real programming when I do these types of problems that's kind of a hard question I mean this isn't going to make you an excellent programmer by any means but it's one of those things that you can do just to kind of you know get the syntax down and to you know kind of keep fresh with with whatever language you're using they have problems and Python they have JavaScript C++ csharp all kinds of different things and it's usually you know some short solution so let's just work through one of these problems and see what this looks like and they also have these sample tests down here so that whenever you run the test it'll tell you if you got the problem right so you don't have to write your own unit tests or anything like that and I've not seen this problem yet so this is new to me and I'm not very good at these types of problem so you guys in the chat might have to help me out but let's see here so it says write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings ordered from shortest to longest so for example if we get this array where were your past an argument of this string here then the function would return so let me actually post this and sublime so that you guys can see a little bit better I know that the screen is a little small here but I'll just leave a comment here so let's say that we got this as an input this list here and we want to return or we want to write a function that will return that list sorted to where it looks like this so they are sorted by length of characters I think is what it's asking for all the strings in the array pasts your function will be different links so you not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length okay so from here the way that I would solve this we can write a custom sorting function and this is another thing that a lot of people ask a lot people always ask like how do you remember everything that you write down in your video well I really don't remember everything from the video like I said I have scripts for the videos so something like this you know this can be something where I need to search like okay list or Python Python list custom sort something like that and then I can go to the Python documentation or a stack overflow question here and I can see how to pass in a function to the sort argument so we can see here that we have a list dot sort and we can pass in the key so if you forgot that syntax then that's how you would do it so how I would do this problem here let's see if we get this right so I have just this custom Python script open here so I'm just gonna call this you know code Wars func and we're gonna take in a list as an argument and now what I want to do with this list is let me create another function up here let's say you know sort by Lynn and we will take in let's see how do we want to do this actually I don't even need to do this all I can do is I can just return L that's sorted and then I can pass in a lambda function and for those who don't know a lambda function is basically just a throwaway function I can just pass the lambda function here and I believe that I can just return by the length of X let's see if this works let me try this might not work you guys are also seeing the code after a few drinks here so hopefully this may not have been the best idea let me go ahead and copy that return statement here and let's test this see what we get L is not defined okay I have to pass this in they were taking it as a ray I'm gonna take it in as L has no object sorted sort see this is my problem here so people say I don't make mistakes and videos and now you can see how many mistakes I'm actually making so yeah we want to set the key equal to that lambda function so let me go back here okay so why wouldn't this work so now whenever I'm working in something like code wars if I don't get it to work then I'll just take the function here and I will paste it into my sublime text and now let's just try to run this function and pass in their sample input and see what we get so I'm going to do a sort by length pass in this list here I'm going to set this equal to L and then I'll print out the return the list okay so we get none okay so let's try this here let's do result is equal to sorted L key is equal to this okay so this might be what we need here so we have the sorted function so when we did L dot sort what it does is it actually sorts the list in place but it doesn't return a sorted list so when we actually capture this as a variable using sorted then this should work so now let me take this back to code Wars here and let's see if this works instead okay so it looks like all of our tests pass and if I hit enter here then the good thing about code Wars is that once you get the right result so we did get the right result here and all of our tests pass if I submit this then I haven't done code words in a long time but it should take me to a page here where I can see everybody else's top submissions and so then we can see all the other submissions that were uploaded and the most what the best practices were and whether they have a clever ranking and they have a best practice ranking so we can see here that this is pretty similar to what we did they returned a sorted array with the key oh ok so see they just set the key equal to Lin which so that was kind of bad practice what I did by passing in that lambda function we didn't even need the lambda function because there's already a length function so that's the kind of stuff that whenever you make those small mistakes and then you see how somebody else did it you can just say like I knew that of course but but yeah it can make you feel dumb sometimes when you see other people's submissions but that's kind of what you can do with code words there so now let me jump back to the chat and see how many people are making in front of me for for how bad I'm doing on these projects here what's the name of this practice exercise so this one was called sort array by string length and let's look at some of these other questions while I was while I was doing that okay so somebody else left a super chat here they said coding coding game.com word / start is another good site for working on problems while making it more fun I've never used that but if anybody wants to give that a shot they can mmhmm TJ Durkin said I'm stuck on database best practices after refactoring to app factories can we get an SQL light my sequel QuickStart I do have a video on sequel light using Python but I haven't done I haven't jumped into a pack thérèse yet so I think I started to touch on app factories at the end of the flash series but yeah if that's something that that people want to know more about them we can take a look at that as well let me see if I missed any other chats up here love the accent thank you it's pretty thick yeah like I said I grew up in West Virginia so I have a thick southern American accent why Python 3 4 I'm actually on my on my machine I'm probably using what am I using here on my machine I'm probably using 3 7 so yeah I'm using 3 7 on my machine I need to download 3 8 but it looks like on code worse they're still using 3 4 I'm not sure why they are maybe it just takes them a while to update that on the website or maybe they had 3 7 then I just didn't see it I could have done a dropdown or something do I use code words often I don't use code words often anymore I used to a lot it was a nice daily exercise for me to kind of try to solve problems on my own and to see I I think the best thing about code Wars is seeing other people's respond or other people's solutions to the problems that you just work through because just like just like I just showed I use that lambda where I returned the length of that list but I could have just set that key equal to the Ling to the length function and that would have been even easier and even better so yeah a lot of you got the answer to that question long before I did like I said I'm not great at those onthespot programming questions you guys should see me in a job interview it's you can ask me the easiest question and I will freeze up when I know people are watching you code better after beers I don't know about that I think I'm I think I might be proving that wrong here somebody said how about data science videos so I am starting on data science videos if you've watched my last videos I've been doing pandas videos and that's you use pretty heavily in the data science world and I'm going to continue with the data with the data science series I'll probably have three or four videos left on pandas and then I'm gonna take a little bit of a break and but that doesn't mean that the series is over there's still a lot to cover so in the next couple of videos on pandas is going to be our you know is going to be how to load in data from multiple different sources how to read in data from multiple different sources like SQL JSON files Excel files and things like that and then after that I'll probably take a break and start doing some oneoff videos for a while but then I'll come back to pandas to touch on some topics that people have requested you know like how to merge data frames and how to do pivot tables and pandas and things like that so where is my dog my dog is currently out of town so I went to Canada a few weeks ago it was actually right before gosh how long ago was that it was probably about a month ago it was right before all this virus stuff became you know became very serious and to where people shouldn't travel anymore so it was right before that so it was there were kind of talks of that virus spreading in certain areas but I don't think there were any confirmed cases the United States at that time so but it was yeah it was a strange experience so when I went to Canada I dropped my dog off at my parents place and and I haven't picked him up yet but I'll probably go and pick him up next week now that's something that a lot of people wanted me to make a video on as well whenever I went up to Canada I visited a I visited a quantum computing company and that was a deep wave deep wave is the name of that company and I don't know anything really about quantum computing it was a totally new experience for me so I was kind of going in completely blind not understanding how this stuff works at all and and I would like to say that I learned a lot while I was there and I think I did learn a lot while I was there but that stuff it still is absolutely mindblowing to me that they actually have these things working and running like I didn't I thought that this stuff was still hypothetical but deep wave if I do do a video on that experience some time then I'll show you their online platform they actually have a service where you can get on and you can run some of your code on their quantum computers and get results back I think there that service is called leap through deep wave and that was in Burnaby Canada it's it's close to Vancouver let's see here let's see if what other questions we have what kind of music do you like and play gosh can okay so yeah you can see my I got my guitar in my banjo in the background there but that's kind of a that's kind of a lie because I don't I'm not good at playing music I just I want to get good at playing music but I I listen to a lot of folk music so I like folk Americana style Avett Brothers Mumford & Sons Lumineers bands like that but I can't really play I'd like to I'd like to learn at some point in the future I saw your face for the first time okay well yeah the I did I've only had one video previously where I actually showed my face so yeah I don't do it a lot I don't like having the webcam on I feel like it's it can be distracting in most videos I just like I just like people being able to see the code so yeah this is this is kind of new new for me as well but in the last video I did I had short hair so I've grown out the hair since then and let's see somebody asked so we have one super chat I just want to thank you and a year and a half thanks to you and syntax I went from zero to senior D s I don't have enough words thank you well yeah man that's I'm glad to hear that that's yeah I love getting messages like that it's one of my favorite things to wake up to is to get messages from people that say that the videos have helped them out in some way so yeah I really appreciate that and thank you for the message I thought you were younger yeah I probably need to change my avatar that's probably my fault that avatar that I have for the YouTube channel is pretty old it's probably about ten years old so I hardly ever take pictures so how do you make your videos uh I've thought about I've thought about doing a video on this as well I use basically it kind of depends it depends on who you are some people were very good at just being able to get on and talk off the cuff and teach whatever they need to teach I'm better when I go off of the script so you guys can probably tell you know this being my first live stream I probably sound a lot different and trip over my words a lot more than I do in the videos and that's because in the videos I write scripts and that takes about probably 95% of the time to write the scripts so I'll write the scripts for the videos I have all my bullet points I know exactly what I want to say what coding examples I want to show and then after I get those scripts done I will use Camtasia to record the videos and then I edit in Camtasia and Camtasia as well have I been to India I've never been to India actually I actually didn't start traveling until recently after i whent full time in youtube I've really only been out of the United States a handful of times I would love to come over to India it would be a be a nice trip the places that I have travelled have been I've been to Mexico a few times I went to Dubai for a work trip whenever I was out in Boulder I worked for the laboratory for atmospheric and space physics and we had a Mars mission with Dubai and the Mars mission was being worked on by the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center and we went over to Dubai to visit that Space Centre and kind of train their team and get to work with their team that was a lot of fun and then recently after I quit my job in went fulltime I went down to Peru but yeah I'd like to do a lot more traveling I've not done a lot of traveling outside the United States do I have a wife I do not have a wife I'm not married how was Boulder Boulder is a great town I loved it out in Boulder it was a beautiful area it was just kind of high cost of living so it's a very expensive place to live and it just didn't make as much sense for me anymore now that I'm working from home to live in such a highcost area so I could get a lot more bang for my buck and where I'm living now and I was able to get a little bit more land for for the dog to run around and stuff out here so so I decided to move back okay so how long have we been going here we've been going for almost an hour now and so like I said I didn't have any plans for this for this live stream whenever I came on I just wanted to you know just to kind of see what you guys were up to and I know that a lot of us are home so I just wanted to get on and do something that might be a little bit fun and answer some questions and maybe do a coding problem but let me know what you guys think about this like I said this is my first live stream I'm completely new to this I probably tripped over over my words a lot and I spent most the time answering questions I planned on doing some more coding but I didn't realize how many people would actually be here writing questions so since we're coming up on an hour let's say yeah I'll probably stop the stream at about 330 and then just do an hourlong stream and if you guys liked this then we can do more of this and if you hated it then you can just say hey go back to 200 and go back to doing normal videos and only do those very you know only do the live streams very rarely so so it's up to you guys really I just want to uh it's it's something we can do more of if you like it it's it's but also the main focus is always going to be the tutorials the the normal tutorials that we do let me read a couple more questions here and then we'll so we'll spend about two more minutes answering questions I'm sorry I didn't do more coding problems but like I said there were just a lot more questions than what I initially thought I thought I'd be answering like two or three questions and then doing mostly coding but we have a lot of questions here so how did I choose Python well I didn't really choose Python I'm glad that I learned Python though it's my favorite language now that I'm using it so like I said I was a fulltime JavaScript developer and after I had to do a backend Python web service once and I learned Python to create that web service and after I wrote that I kind of fell in love with that I was like man this is so much easier than you know what I've been using before which was Java and JavaScript so after that I really enjoyed it wanted to learn more and I wanted to do it fulltime so I started looking for fulltime Python jobs okay all right let's say I'll answer one more question here and then then let's in the live stream for now and if you guys want to do more like this then we can in the future I'll probably be less nervous than now that I've got the first one out of the way let's see here so do I one question was do I plan to do more with the Django and flask series it's been a while since I have have put out videos on the Django and flash series now I definitely do want to do more with the Django and flash series but I think what I'm gonna do is instead of adding to those existing tutorials I think what I'm going to do is I'm just going to completely revamp the series and I'm gonna do flasks from scratch and I'm gonna do Django from scratch and I'll probably build a similar application but I'm just going to add more to the application so so some things that weren't added to the first Django series or the first flash series that I would like to add to the to the next series that I do on those are going to be things like twofactor authentication how to you know a lot of people want me to show how to add pictures and comments to different posts and things like that so we could take that application and we could make it a lot larger than it is now with a lot more functionality and teach you guys a lot more so that so that's something that we can definitely do with that series and I will do that for both flask and Django but those those should take a while to put together but not too because I'm probably just gonna use the same the same building blocks of the application that we built before and just add to that with those extra features and you guys can always send me the features that you'd like to see added we can do twofactor authentication images and comment section and things like that as well all right well I think that is going to be it I really appreciate you guys tuning in and asking all these questions I know that it's not hopefully that it hopefully you guys had a good time hanging out and asking questions and and just you know talking back and forth I hope you guys are all staying safe I know that it's crazy times going on right now it's it's wild it's wild what's happening and I hope you guys are all staying inside and doing the social distancing protocols that are in place everywhere so but yeah you guys stay safe stay out of crowded areas and I will talk to you guys soon if you guys enjoyed this again just let me know we can always do more all right thank you guys so much and I will see you soon
