00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video I'd like to walk through how
00:03 - to set up a Python development
00:04 - environment in sublime text now I get a
00:06 - lot of requests to show how I have my
00:09 - development environment set up and also
00:11 - what packages I have installed and what
00:13 - settings I use and also how I run Python
00:16 - from within sublime text now I've
00:18 - actually done a basic walkthrough of
00:20 - setting up sublime text in a previous
00:22 - video but that's actually more geared
00:24 - towards web development back when my
00:26 - full time job was doing front-end
00:28 - JavaScript work now that video is also
00:30 - pretty old now and there are a few
00:31 - things that are now done differently so
00:34 - I'm just going to completely uninstall
00:35 - sublime text and walk through the entire
00:37 - process from scratch and this time
00:39 - instead focusing on setting up an
00:41 - environment for Python development so
00:44 - with that said let's go ahead and get
00:45 - started
00:46 - so I've already completely deleted
00:48 - sublime text from my machine and now I'm
00:51 - over here at the sublime text 3 download
00:53 - page now the first thing usually people
00:57 - ask me about sublime text is whether or
00:59 - not it is free and you can see here on
01:01 - their download page that sublime text
01:04 - may be downloaded and evaluated for free
01:07 - however a license must be purchased for
01:10 - continued use and there's currently no
01:11 - enforced time limit for the evaluation
01:13 - so basically what that means is that
01:15 - sublime text is free to download and use
01:18 - for an unlimited amount of time but if
01:20 - you don't purchase a license then you'll
01:22 - occasionally get a notice asking you to
01:24 - make a purchase
01:25 - so I've personally bought a license but
01:27 - it's not 100% necessary so you don't
01:30 - need one to do this walkthrough let's
01:32 - walk through this video or to use
01:33 - sublime text for as long as you want ok
01:35 - so let's go ahead and download sublime
01:37 - text so I'm going to download this for
01:38 - my operating system and I'm on a Mac but
01:41 - if you're on Windows or Linux then
01:43 - you'll want to install the version for
01:44 - your system ok so now that is finished
01:47 - downloading I'm going to go ahead and
01:49 - open this and on a Mac I just have to
01:53 - drag this into my Applications folder
01:55 - but on another operating system you
01:57 - might have to walk through a quick
01:59 - installation ok so now let's go ahead
02:01 - and open up that fresh installation of
02:03 - sublime text
02:04 - now I have a sample python module here
02:08 - that I'm going to use just so we have
02:10 - something to run within sublime
02:13 - so let me go ahead and drag this over
02:16 - real quick okay now I'll just go ahead
02:18 - and maximize this here and open up this
02:23 - test module so this is a sample class
02:25 - that I used for my object-oriented
02:26 - series now if you don't know what this
02:28 - code is doing then don't worry about it
02:30 - I just wanted something that we can run
02:31 - within sublime and also something with
02:33 - classes and functions so that we can see
02:35 - the difference between the different
02:37 - color schemes so let me go ahead and
02:39 - make this big enough so that everyone
02:40 - can see here okay so at this point you
02:43 - can run Python programs using the
02:45 - automatic build system so if I wanted to
02:48 - run this code then I could just come up
02:50 - here to tools and if I wanted to see the
02:52 - build systems and I could just hover
02:54 - over that and you can see that it's set
02:56 - to automatic now I don't really use the
02:58 - automatic build system anymore but we'll
03:00 - get to that later now if you wanted to
03:02 - try to run this Python code then you
03:04 - could just come down here to build and
03:06 - if you're on a Mac then you can see that
03:08 - the shortcut for that is command B so
03:11 - I'm going to go ahead and run that now
03:13 - with this automatic build system mine
03:15 - has some weird characters here at the
03:17 - top and that's because it has a conflict
03:19 - with one of my dot files you can just
03:21 - ignore that because you're probably not
03:23 - going to have anything like that but it
03:25 - does run the code from our file here at
03:27 - the bottom and like I said that yours
03:30 - will most likely just run the first
03:32 - statements without all that other junk
03:33 - at the top but I'll talk more about
03:35 - build systems towards the end of this
03:37 - video okay so this is just a basic fresh
03:40 - installation of sublime text where we
03:42 - can run some simple code so let's go
03:44 - ahead and customize this a bit and add
03:46 - some extra functionality so I'll show
03:47 - you how I set this up and how you're
03:49 - used to seeing this in my videos so
03:52 - first of all we're going to want to
03:53 - install package control now it used to
03:55 - be that you had to do this manually and
03:57 - copy and paste a long command into your
03:59 - sublime text terminal but after one of
04:01 - the updates I'm not sure which one but
04:03 - they added the ability to do this
04:05 - directly through sublime text and I'm
04:07 - sure that they did this because package
04:08 - control is so popular and they wanted to
04:11 - make this as easy as possible so package
04:13 - control allows us to install third-party
04:15 - packages that add functionality to
04:17 - sublime text so we can up open our
04:20 - command palette by going to tools and
04:23 - then clicking here on command palette
04:25 - and the shortcut on the
04:27 - Mack you can see here is command shift P
04:29 - and I'll probably use that shortcut for
04:31 - the rest of this video now once we have
04:33 - that command palette open then let's
04:35 - just type in install and you can see
04:38 - that the top option here is install
04:40 - package control so let's go ahead and
04:42 - click on that and if we wait for just a
04:45 - second there then it should pop up with
04:48 - this package control was successfully
04:50 - installed pop-up once that is finished
04:52 - so let's go ahead and exit out of that
04:54 - okay so after you get that notification
04:56 - we should be able to install packages so
04:59 - let's open up that same command palette
05:01 - as before so on Mac that was command
05:04 - shift P and now let's just type install
05:07 - and you can see that the first option
05:09 - here is install package so I'm going to
05:11 - go ahead and select that
05:12 - so the first packages that I'm going to
05:14 - want to install are my themes and color
05:17 - schemes that I use now if you explore
05:19 - around different packages then you might
05:20 - notice color schemes and themes the
05:23 - difference between a color scheme and a
05:24 - theme is that the color schemes change
05:26 - the color of your syntax and things like
05:28 - that and the theme changes the entire
05:31 - look and interface of sublime text so if
05:33 - you like this interface but just want to
05:35 - change the color of your code then you
05:37 - could try different color schemes but
05:39 - I've been using the same theme and color
05:41 - scheme for some time now and I really
05:43 - like that and you can look around at
05:45 - different ones to see what you like but
05:47 - a color scheme that I like is called
05:49 - pre-dawn and the theme that I like is
05:51 - called material so I'm going to go ahead
05:53 - and install both of those so to install
05:55 - pre-dawn I'm just going to type in
05:57 - pre-dawn here and you'll see that that
05:59 - pops up as the first option so I'm just
06:02 - going to go ahead and click on that to
06:03 - install it if you look in the bottom
06:05 - left you can see that it says that it's
06:07 - installing a pre-dawn so most of these
06:09 - packages install pretty quickly now
06:10 - after you install a package then some of
06:13 - them pop up with these readme files
06:15 - giving you more information so you can
06:18 - see here that this theme popped up a
06:20 - readme and gives us some activation
06:22 - instructions and additional recommended
06:24 - settings and things like that
06:26 - now I'm not only going to be using the
06:28 - pre-dawn color scheme and not the entire
06:30 - theme so to install the theme that I'm
06:33 - going to open up my command palette
06:34 - again and install another package and
06:37 - this is called material theme
06:40 - so if I just type in material it doesn't
06:42 - pop up all the way but material theme is
06:45 - the one that we want and now that's the
06:46 - top one here so I'm going to go ahead
06:47 - and install that okay so that material
06:50 - theme has finished installing and it
06:52 - usually pops up a another readme file
06:54 - just like the pre-dawn readme but for
06:56 - some reason it didn't this time but
06:58 - that's okay because I'm going to show
06:59 - you all the settings that I personally
07:01 - use and I've kind of mixed and matched
07:03 - the recommended settings for both of
07:05 - these packages and also have some
07:07 - additional settings that I personally
07:08 - like to have set as well and I have
07:10 - these available on my github page and
07:12 - I'll put a link to this in the
07:13 - description section below a lot of
07:15 - people have been asking me to put more
07:17 - things up on my personal github page
07:19 - lately so I'm going to try to start
07:20 - putting everything up there so if I pull
07:23 - up my github page here I've already got
07:25 - it pulled up here within Chrome and so
07:28 - my sublime text settings are a little
07:30 - Barry's down here and my dot files and
07:32 - NIT folder but like I said I'll have a
07:35 - link to this page directly in the
07:37 - description section
07:37 - so the first settings that I'm going to
07:39 - change here are my general sublime text
07:41 - settings and these are located within
07:44 - this Preferences dot sublime settings
07:46 - file here so I'm going to go ahead and
07:49 - click on that and I'll go over these in
07:51 - a minute but for now I'm just going to
07:52 - go ahead and copy all of these and place
07:55 - these into sublime so I'm going to copy
07:57 - those and now within sublime text I'm
07:59 - going to click up here on sublime and
08:01 - then preferences and then settings now
08:04 - that's how you get there on a Mac I
08:07 - believe on the windows those preferences
08:08 - might be under the file but I'm not
08:11 - entirely sure now when I open up the
08:13 - sublime settings it opens up two
08:15 - different files here and this confuses
08:17 - some people so on the Left we have our
08:20 - default settings and on the right we
08:22 - have our user settings now you only want
08:24 - to make changes to the user settings
08:26 - because the default settings can get
08:28 - overwritten when we do updates and
08:30 - things like that so within my user
08:32 - settings over here on the right I'm
08:34 - going to go ahead and erase everything
08:36 - and then just paste in what I copied
08:39 - over from my github page okay so now
08:41 - when I save these settings then you're
08:43 - going to see the theme change the entire
08:45 - interface so if I save that then you can
08:48 - see that that entire interface looks
08:50 - different now
08:50 - now usually after I make a lot of
08:52 - changes to any settings
08:54 - I usually like to restart sublime text
08:56 - just to make sure that all those changes
08:58 - take effect so let's go ahead and quit
09:00 - out of sublime text and then open this
09:03 - back up and we may need to quit out of
09:06 - these settings and reopen those when we
09:09 - open sublime text back up to okay so now
09:12 - let's go over some of these settings
09:13 - that I set and like I said these are my
09:15 - personal preferences so you can tweak
09:17 - these any way you like
09:19 - now a few of these are suggested
09:21 - settings that came with the packages so
09:23 - for example here we have the theme is
09:25 - set to material theme and I like the
09:28 - darker theme for that and the color
09:30 - scheme like I said is that pre-dawn
09:31 - theme and then these are just some
09:33 - additional theme settings that I like to
09:35 - have set here the graphite color and the
09:39 - compact sidebar now for the font face I
09:41 - use source Crowe Pro and that is
09:44 - available for free on google fonts and
09:46 - I'll leave a link to that in the
09:47 - description section below as well now I
09:49 - have the font size set really large
09:51 - because I do these videos but when I'm
09:53 - working on personal projects I usually
09:55 - take that down a bit okay so I'm not
09:57 - going to go over all of these but let's
09:59 - see if any of these really pop out to me
10:02 - here
10:03 - so this scroll past the end I like to
10:05 - have that set to true because if that's
10:08 - not set to true then once you get to the
10:10 - end of a file then it doesn't let you
10:12 - scroll past it kind of like over here
10:14 - let that set the true it just lets you
10:16 - scroll past and I find that useful
10:18 - I'm also here I have my translate tabs
10:20 - to spaces set to true and that's just so
10:23 - everything stays consistent even when I
10:25 - use tabs now I've got my show
10:28 - definitions and show errors and line set
10:31 - to false because I don't really like
10:33 - things popping up and getting getting in
10:35 - my way when I'm coding now if you want
10:37 - more of an IDE type of feel and maybe
10:40 - you want those set to true okay so
10:42 - that's a quick look on my sublime
10:44 - settings now you can always go over here
10:46 - to the default settings and look at
10:47 - everything that is available for you and
10:49 - also they have a lot of good comments
10:51 - here that show you what those options
10:54 - mean so if you want to read through
10:56 - there then you can figure out if you
10:58 - want to you know change some of these
10:59 - round around to your own personal
11:01 - preferences okay so now let's go ahead
11:03 - and get moving along and installing some
11:06 - more package
11:07 - and some of these we're going to move
11:09 - through fairly quickly so I'm going to
11:11 - close that down and now I'm going to
11:13 - open up my command palette again and
11:16 - like I said before you can click on
11:18 - tools and command palette or you can use
11:20 - that keyboard shortcut now I'm going to
11:22 - type in install package now one package
11:25 - I like is called bracket highlighter if
11:28 - I type in bracket we can see it down
11:30 - here bracket highlighter I'm going to
11:32 - install that and after that finish
11:34 - installing it will pop up a small readme
11:36 - now basically what this does is it helps
11:38 - you keep track of where certain brackets
11:40 - begin and end so if I have a set of
11:44 - brackets up here that spans multiple
11:47 - lines then you'll see when I click on
11:50 - the opening or closing brace it'll show
11:53 - you the other brace over here and the
11:55 - gutter where that begins or ends and
11:57 - it's extremely useful in languages that
11:59 - use a lot of braces like JavaScript but
12:01 - I find it useful in Python from time to
12:03 - time too especially since it underlines
12:06 - the other bracket so you can more easily
12:08 - see if you haven't closed something off
12:10 - properly or not so now let's go ahead
12:13 - and get rid of those and install another
12:16 - package now another package that I find
12:20 - useful is sidebar enhancements now if I
12:22 - do a secondary click over here in my
12:26 - sidebar without this installed then you
12:29 - can see that the options are pretty
12:30 - limited we just have new file new folder
12:33 - things like that so now let's install
12:35 - sidebar enhancements and once that's
12:41 - finished installing if I click over here
12:43 - and do a secondary click in my sidebar
12:45 - now and you'll see that we have a lot
12:47 - more options for searching and opening
12:49 - files and things like that and I find
12:51 - these new options very useful okay so
12:54 - now let's install a package that's a
12:56 - very Python specific so this adds a lot
13:00 - of Python functionality to sublime text
13:02 - now this will allow you to set up code
13:05 - linting and auto formatting the ability
13:08 - to jump to function definitions and
13:10 - things like that
13:11 - now this package is called let me in
13:13 - click install package and this package
13:16 - is called anaconda so I'm going to go
13:19 - ahead and install that now this is
13:21 - different
13:21 - from the Anaconda Python distribution
13:24 - from continuum analytics this is just a
13:26 - sublime text package with the same name
13:28 - so let's install that and I'll show you
13:31 - a few of the specific settings that I
13:33 - use with that anaconda package now if
13:35 - you're ever unsure if you're installing
13:37 - the correct package or not then a lot of
13:39 - these have links to the github pages as
13:42 - well so you can always go to those pages
13:44 - to make sure that you're installing what
13:46 - you think you're installing okay so now
13:47 - that we have this installed let me show
13:49 - you some of the settings that I use
13:50 - specifically with this package now I'm
13:52 - going to pull back up my github page
13:54 - here and if I go back a page and you can
13:59 - see that I have anaconda sublime
14:01 - settings here as well so I'm going to go
14:02 - ahead and click on that now there's a
14:04 - lot less personal settings that I have
14:06 - here than my general sublime settings so
14:09 - I'm just going to go ahead and do the
14:10 - same thing and copy these and now we
14:13 - want to access the anaconda settings
14:15 - within sublime text now to get here we
14:18 - can go to sublime preferences package
14:21 - settings anaconda and then within
14:25 - anaconda I'll go to settings actually
14:28 - I'm going to open up settings default
14:30 - and then I'm also going to go to that
14:33 - same place preferences package settings
14:35 - anaconda and I'm also going to open up
14:37 - the settings user now I'm going to go
14:40 - ahead and set someone Tex and to split
14:42 - screen mode so that we can see both of
14:44 - these and on a Mac that is command
14:46 - option 2 and I'm sorry I'm not sure what
14:48 - that keyboard shortcut is on Windows now
14:51 - just like with our general settings we
14:53 - don't want to change the default
14:55 - settings we only want to change our user
14:57 - settings because the default settings
14:59 - can be overridden when we do updates and
15:02 - the user settings will always remain
15:04 - what we put in that file so we want to
15:06 - make our changes to the user settings so
15:08 - the user settings are currently blank so
15:11 - I'm going to go ahead and paste in what
15:12 - I got from the github file and then I'm
15:14 - going to go ahead and save those now
15:16 - just a quick side note if you want to
15:18 - change settings for any other packages
15:20 - then the same place that we located the
15:22 - Anaconda settings that's where you can
15:24 - locate settings for other packages as
15:26 - well and those were within package
15:28 - settings but anaconda are the ones that
15:30 - we're going to change right now
15:31 - now just like my general settings when I
15:33 - save a lot of changes to the settings
15:35 - I usually like to restart sublime text
15:37 - just to make sure that everything takes
15:39 - effect correctly I don't think you have
15:41 - to always do that but I do it just in
15:43 - case okay so we just restarted that now
15:46 - let's go ahead and take a look at the
15:48 - settings now there isn't a whole lot
15:49 - here basically I'm saying that I want
15:52 - Auto formatting turned on and what this
15:55 - does is it will auto format your code to
15:57 - be pet bait compliant if possible I like
16:00 - this because it keeps my code consistent
16:02 - so for example if I go here to my test
16:06 - module and I put some extra lines here
16:09 - between the methods and the properties
16:13 - and then I save this and you can see as
16:15 - soon as I save it it formatted back to
16:18 - the proper pep eight compliant settings
16:21 - there okay so back to the settings I
16:23 - also have some Auto formatting ignores
16:26 - in here now I actually don't remember
16:29 - what III o.9 is but I do remember that
16:32 - the e 501 is for maximum line length
16:36 - allowed now I probably should keep my
16:38 - lines
16:38 - shorter when coding but I go over that
16:41 - limit a lot and I don't like warnings to
16:43 - pop up all the time so if you have any
16:45 - auto formatting or pet bait warnings
16:47 - that you want to ignore then you can
16:49 - just put those within the auto format
16:51 - ignore and the pet bait ignore now
16:53 - really other than that I just have some
16:54 - lender settings here that are turned off
16:57 - now the reason I have those turned off
16:58 - is because it already marks the errors
17:01 - and the gutter and that's good enough
17:02 - for me and also you know this is less
17:05 - intrusive with these turned off so what
17:08 - I mean that it marks those in the gutter
17:10 - so let's say for example that I make a
17:13 - for loop here so I'll just do for num in
17:16 - and then do a list of one two three four
17:19 - and I'm going to forget to put a colon
17:21 - here and then I'm just going to print
17:23 - and instead of printing num I'm going to
17:26 - print n so I'm going to have the wrong
17:27 - variable name there and I'll save that
17:29 - so you can see with the linting that
17:31 - this anaconda package provides that it
17:34 - pops up with a ball here and the gutter
17:36 - telling me that something looks wrong
17:38 - now if I click anywhere in this line and
17:41 - look at the bottom left I'm sorry if
17:43 - this is a little small for your screen I
17:44 - don't know how to make this larger but
17:47 - down here it says invalid its syntax
17:49 - now after looking at that line for a
17:51 - little bit then you'll probably notice
17:53 - that the colon is missing so we'll go
17:55 - ahead and add that in and save it and
17:57 - now the warning that pops up down here
17:59 - is that we're supposed to have another
18:01 - line in between our class and the rest
18:04 - of the code so it's go ahead and save
18:06 - that now we have one more ball over here
18:09 - in the gutter and if I click on that
18:10 - line then it says undefined name in so
18:14 - then we'll realize that all instead of
18:15 - in that's supposed to be none and then
18:18 - when I save that you can see that the
18:20 - rest of those go away so it's nice
18:21 - having that linter watching everything
18:23 - in the background because we all make
18:25 - dumb mistakes like that and it's nice to
18:27 - have something that points those out now
18:29 - the reason I opened the default settings
18:31 - for anaconda here is just like with the
18:35 - general sublime settings it's nice to be
18:39 - able to look through all of the options
18:41 - that you have available and also all the
18:43 - documentation of what each of these
18:45 - options do so you can read through and
18:48 - know exactly what changes will do what
18:51 - and like I said these are just my
18:52 - personal preferences so I'd recommend
18:54 - you come in and kind of you know read
18:56 - around and try some different things for
18:58 - yourself and you know set this up how
19:00 - you prefer to have it set up in your
19:03 - sublime text okay so now that we're done
19:05 - with those settings I'm going to go
19:06 - ahead and make this non split screen
19:09 - again and to do that I hit command
19:11 - option and one to make this one pane and
19:14 - now I'm going to go ahead and close down
19:16 - all of the other windows or tabs that we
19:18 - have open here and just have my test
19:21 - module here now as far as the packages
19:23 - that I install that's basically it now I
19:26 - also mentioned that I'd go over build
19:27 - systems real quick and I think that if
19:30 - you're going to be working on multiple
19:31 - projects then you should become more
19:33 - familiar with how these work now like I
19:35 - said before this is currently set up as
19:38 - the automatic build system which runs
19:40 - your script with a default Python on
19:42 - your machine but if you want to use
19:44 - different versions of Python or virtual
19:46 - environments then you'll need to set up
19:48 - multiple build systems now I'm not going
19:50 - to go in depth about build systems in
19:52 - this video because I have a video
19:53 - specifically about build systems and
19:55 - I'll link to that in the description
19:57 - section below but I will show the quick
19:59 - process of how to set up a basic Python
20:01 - version 2 and
20:03 - Python version 3 build system now I also
20:05 - have these available on my github page
20:07 - as well so I'm going to go ahead and
20:09 - pull those up and go back and you can
20:11 - see that I have a Python sublime build
20:15 - system for Python 2 7 and 1 also for
20:18 - Python 3 5 I'm going to open these both
20:20 - up and their own tabs so you can see
20:22 - these files are very small and this one
20:25 - has the path to python 2 7 and this one
20:28 - has the path to python 3 5 now like i
20:32 - said i'm not going to go in-depth as to
20:34 - what these build systems do i have a
20:36 - separate video on that but for now i'm
20:38 - just going to go ahead and copy this
20:39 - code from this Python to build system
20:42 - and now within sublime text
20:44 - I'm going to go up here to tools and
20:46 - build system and then down here to new
20:49 - build system and now look in here I'm
20:51 - just going to paste the code that I
20:54 - grabbed from the github page now within
20:57 - here I'll go ahead and save this and I'm
21:00 - going to save this as Python 2 7 dot
21:04 - sublime build now be sure that you leave
21:07 - that sublime build extension on there
21:09 - you don't want to accidentally remove
21:10 - that so I'm going to go ahead and save
21:12 - that
21:13 - now this pop-up that I just received
21:15 - here now these are what you'll get from
21:17 - time to time if you haven't purchased a
21:19 - license for sublime text so like I said
21:21 - you can use sublime text for an
21:22 - unlimited amount of time but if you
21:24 - don't purchase a license then you'll get
21:26 - these pop-ups from time to time so for
21:28 - now I'm just going to go ahead and hit
21:29 - cancel on that okay so now we just
21:31 - created our Python 2:7 build system now
21:34 - let's do the same thing for Python 3 5
21:37 - so I'm going to open up my github page
21:40 - here and copy those settings for the
21:43 - Python 3 5 build system then I'm just
21:46 - going to go through the same process I'm
21:47 - going to go to tools build system new
21:50 - build system and paste all of that code
21:54 - in there and save that now be careful
21:56 - not to overwrite the sublime build
21:58 - extension we just want to call this
22:00 - python 3.5 and save that so now that
22:04 - we've saved these build systems then we
22:07 - can go to tools build system and now we
22:11 - have this Python 2 7 and python 3 5
22:14 - build system in here so if I choose this
22:16 - Python
22:17 - three five build system and now if I run
22:19 - my code here within sublime text now you
22:22 - could have gone to tools and build but I
22:25 - just use the keyboard shortcut for that
22:27 - you can see that now when we run our
22:29 - code now we're running this user local
22:32 - bin Python 3 5 and when we print out the
22:35 - version it says 3 5 and then it also
22:37 - runs the rest of our code down here at
22:39 - the bottom now like I said I do have a
22:41 - full video on those build systems so I
22:43 - would suggest watching that if you need
22:45 - to use Python from a specific virtual
22:47 - environment or anything like that ok so
22:50 - that basically does a prowl I set up my
22:52 - Python development environment now one
22:54 - more thing if you do experiment around
22:56 - with different packages and you don't
22:58 - like one that you've installed then you
23:00 - can easily remove a package by opening
23:02 - up your command palette so I'm going to
23:04 - do that with command shift P and instead
23:06 - of installing a package if you type
23:09 - remove and you can see remove package
23:11 - down here as well and if I click on
23:13 - remove package it'll show you all the
23:15 - packages that you've installed and you
23:17 - can remove any of those that you try out
23:18 - and end up not liking ok so I think
23:21 - that's going to do it for this video now
23:23 - this is everything specific to my Python
23:25 - development environment now if you look
23:27 - at the github page that I linked then
23:29 - you'll see that I also have some
23:30 - personalized keyboard shortcuts in there
23:32 - as well but I thought that those were
23:34 - you know so personal preference that no
23:36 - one would be too interested in those but
23:38 - if you'd like to see those shortcuts
23:40 - then you can view those you know at the
23:44 - same github page that I have linked so
23:46 - if you'd like to see some more videos on
23:48 - optimizing sublime text then you can
23:50 - view my playlist on my channel and I'll
23:52 - put a link to that in the description
23:54 - section below and if you're doing
23:55 - anything with web development related
23:57 - and you can watch my older sublime text
23:59 - setup video and I go over some
24:01 - additional packages that are good for
24:02 - you know linting HTML CSS JavaScript and
24:06 - things like that now I also have a video
24:08 - on how to set up the s UBL command line
24:11 - command in order to open files and
24:13 - folders and sublime text from your
24:15 - command line and I find that extremely
24:17 - useful and you can find those in the
24:19 - playlists that I just mentioned so I
24:21 - hope that people found this useful one
24:23 - of the most popular questions on the
24:24 - channel is you know what editor I'm
24:26 - using and how I set it up to run Python
24:28 - code so I hope now every
24:30 - one gets their setup exactly how they
24:32 - like now I've also had a lot of
24:34 - questions of people asking me for my
24:36 - opinion on Adam which is another editor
24:39 - that is becoming popular now I do like
24:41 - Adam and some good things is that you
24:42 - know it's completely free it's made by
24:44 - the people of github and it has a lot of
24:46 - support I've also put together a video
24:48 - on setting up by Python development
24:50 - environment within Adam also so that if
24:53 - anyone is interested in using that
24:55 - editor then they can see how that's done
24:57 - and I'll put a link to that in the
24:58 - description section below as well now if
25:00 - anyone is wondering if I would recommend
25:02 - sublime text or Adam and I would really
25:05 - just say that it depends now I think
25:06 - Adam is more user-friendly if you're
25:08 - just getting started out now if you
25:10 - don't want to purchase sublime text and
25:13 - I would say that Adam is a good option
25:14 - but I've been using sublime text for so
25:17 - long now that I'm more used to it and
25:19 - find myself always going back to it so
25:21 - you know really the choice is just up to
25:23 - you okay so I think that about does it
25:25 - if anyone has any questions about what
25:27 - we covered in this video then feel free
25:29 - to ask in the comment section below and
25:30 - I'll do my best to answer those now if
25:32 - you enjoy these tutorials and would like
25:34 - to support them then there's several
25:35 - ways you can do that now the easiest way
25:37 - is to simply like the video and give it
25:39 - a thumbs up and also it's a huge help to
25:40 - share these videos with anyone who you
25:42 - think would find them useful and if you
25:44 - have the means and you can contribute
25:45 - through patreon and there's a link to

Cleaned transcript:

hey there how's it going everybody in this video I'd like to walk through how to set up a Python development environment in sublime text now I get a lot of requests to show how I have my development environment set up and also what packages I have installed and what settings I use and also how I run Python from within sublime text now I've actually done a basic walkthrough of setting up sublime text in a previous video but that's actually more geared towards web development back when my full time job was doing frontend JavaScript work now that video is also pretty old now and there are a few things that are now done differently so I'm just going to completely uninstall sublime text and walk through the entire process from scratch and this time instead focusing on setting up an environment for Python development so with that said let's go ahead and get started so I've already completely deleted sublime text from my machine and now I'm over here at the sublime text 3 download page now the first thing usually people ask me about sublime text is whether or not it is free and you can see here on their download page that sublime text may be downloaded and evaluated for free however a license must be purchased for continued use and there's currently no enforced time limit for the evaluation so basically what that means is that sublime text is free to download and use for an unlimited amount of time but if you don't purchase a license then you'll occasionally get a notice asking you to make a purchase so I've personally bought a license but it's not 100% necessary so you don't need one to do this walkthrough let's walk through this video or to use sublime text for as long as you want ok so let's go ahead and download sublime text so I'm going to download this for my operating system and I'm on a Mac but if you're on Windows or Linux then you'll want to install the version for your system ok so now that is finished downloading I'm going to go ahead and open this and on a Mac I just have to drag this into my Applications folder but on another operating system you might have to walk through a quick installation ok so now let's go ahead and open up that fresh installation of sublime text now I have a sample python module here that I'm going to use just so we have something to run within sublime so let me go ahead and drag this over real quick okay now I'll just go ahead and maximize this here and open up this test module so this is a sample class that I used for my objectoriented series now if you don't know what this code is doing then don't worry about it I just wanted something that we can run within sublime and also something with classes and functions so that we can see the difference between the different color schemes so let me go ahead and make this big enough so that everyone can see here okay so at this point you can run Python programs using the automatic build system so if I wanted to run this code then I could just come up here to tools and if I wanted to see the build systems and I could just hover over that and you can see that it's set to automatic now I don't really use the automatic build system anymore but we'll get to that later now if you wanted to try to run this Python code then you could just come down here to build and if you're on a Mac then you can see that the shortcut for that is command B so I'm going to go ahead and run that now with this automatic build system mine has some weird characters here at the top and that's because it has a conflict with one of my dot files you can just ignore that because you're probably not going to have anything like that but it does run the code from our file here at the bottom and like I said that yours will most likely just run the first statements without all that other junk at the top but I'll talk more about build systems towards the end of this video okay so this is just a basic fresh installation of sublime text where we can run some simple code so let's go ahead and customize this a bit and add some extra functionality so I'll show you how I set this up and how you're used to seeing this in my videos so first of all we're going to want to install package control now it used to be that you had to do this manually and copy and paste a long command into your sublime text terminal but after one of the updates I'm not sure which one but they added the ability to do this directly through sublime text and I'm sure that they did this because package control is so popular and they wanted to make this as easy as possible so package control allows us to install thirdparty packages that add functionality to sublime text so we can up open our command palette by going to tools and then clicking here on command palette and the shortcut on the Mack you can see here is command shift P and I'll probably use that shortcut for the rest of this video now once we have that command palette open then let's just type in install and you can see that the top option here is install package control so let's go ahead and click on that and if we wait for just a second there then it should pop up with this package control was successfully installed popup once that is finished so let's go ahead and exit out of that okay so after you get that notification we should be able to install packages so let's open up that same command palette as before so on Mac that was command shift P and now let's just type install and you can see that the first option here is install package so I'm going to go ahead and select that so the first packages that I'm going to want to install are my themes and color schemes that I use now if you explore around different packages then you might notice color schemes and themes the difference between a color scheme and a theme is that the color schemes change the color of your syntax and things like that and the theme changes the entire look and interface of sublime text so if you like this interface but just want to change the color of your code then you could try different color schemes but I've been using the same theme and color scheme for some time now and I really like that and you can look around at different ones to see what you like but a color scheme that I like is called predawn and the theme that I like is called material so I'm going to go ahead and install both of those so to install predawn I'm just going to type in predawn here and you'll see that that pops up as the first option so I'm just going to go ahead and click on that to install it if you look in the bottom left you can see that it says that it's installing a predawn so most of these packages install pretty quickly now after you install a package then some of them pop up with these readme files giving you more information so you can see here that this theme popped up a readme and gives us some activation instructions and additional recommended settings and things like that now I'm not only going to be using the predawn color scheme and not the entire theme so to install the theme that I'm going to open up my command palette again and install another package and this is called material theme so if I just type in material it doesn't pop up all the way but material theme is the one that we want and now that's the top one here so I'm going to go ahead and install that okay so that material theme has finished installing and it usually pops up a another readme file just like the predawn readme but for some reason it didn't this time but that's okay because I'm going to show you all the settings that I personally use and I've kind of mixed and matched the recommended settings for both of these packages and also have some additional settings that I personally like to have set as well and I have these available on my github page and I'll put a link to this in the description section below a lot of people have been asking me to put more things up on my personal github page lately so I'm going to try to start putting everything up there so if I pull up my github page here I've already got it pulled up here within Chrome and so my sublime text settings are a little Barry's down here and my dot files and NIT folder but like I said I'll have a link to this page directly in the description section so the first settings that I'm going to change here are my general sublime text settings and these are located within this Preferences dot sublime settings file here so I'm going to go ahead and click on that and I'll go over these in a minute but for now I'm just going to go ahead and copy all of these and place these into sublime so I'm going to copy those and now within sublime text I'm going to click up here on sublime and then preferences and then settings now that's how you get there on a Mac I believe on the windows those preferences might be under the file but I'm not entirely sure now when I open up the sublime settings it opens up two different files here and this confuses some people so on the Left we have our default settings and on the right we have our user settings now you only want to make changes to the user settings because the default settings can get overwritten when we do updates and things like that so within my user settings over here on the right I'm going to go ahead and erase everything and then just paste in what I copied over from my github page okay so now when I save these settings then you're going to see the theme change the entire interface so if I save that then you can see that that entire interface looks different now now usually after I make a lot of changes to any settings I usually like to restart sublime text just to make sure that all those changes take effect so let's go ahead and quit out of sublime text and then open this back up and we may need to quit out of these settings and reopen those when we open sublime text back up to okay so now let's go over some of these settings that I set and like I said these are my personal preferences so you can tweak these any way you like now a few of these are suggested settings that came with the packages so for example here we have the theme is set to material theme and I like the darker theme for that and the color scheme like I said is that predawn theme and then these are just some additional theme settings that I like to have set here the graphite color and the compact sidebar now for the font face I use source Crowe Pro and that is available for free on google fonts and I'll leave a link to that in the description section below as well now I have the font size set really large because I do these videos but when I'm working on personal projects I usually take that down a bit okay so I'm not going to go over all of these but let's see if any of these really pop out to me here so this scroll past the end I like to have that set to true because if that's not set to true then once you get to the end of a file then it doesn't let you scroll past it kind of like over here let that set the true it just lets you scroll past and I find that useful I'm also here I have my translate tabs to spaces set to true and that's just so everything stays consistent even when I use tabs now I've got my show definitions and show errors and line set to false because I don't really like things popping up and getting getting in my way when I'm coding now if you want more of an IDE type of feel and maybe you want those set to true okay so that's a quick look on my sublime settings now you can always go over here to the default settings and look at everything that is available for you and also they have a lot of good comments here that show you what those options mean so if you want to read through there then you can figure out if you want to you know change some of these round around to your own personal preferences okay so now let's go ahead and get moving along and installing some more package and some of these we're going to move through fairly quickly so I'm going to close that down and now I'm going to open up my command palette again and like I said before you can click on tools and command palette or you can use that keyboard shortcut now I'm going to type in install package now one package I like is called bracket highlighter if I type in bracket we can see it down here bracket highlighter I'm going to install that and after that finish installing it will pop up a small readme now basically what this does is it helps you keep track of where certain brackets begin and end so if I have a set of brackets up here that spans multiple lines then you'll see when I click on the opening or closing brace it'll show you the other brace over here and the gutter where that begins or ends and it's extremely useful in languages that use a lot of braces like JavaScript but I find it useful in Python from time to time too especially since it underlines the other bracket so you can more easily see if you haven't closed something off properly or not so now let's go ahead and get rid of those and install another package now another package that I find useful is sidebar enhancements now if I do a secondary click over here in my sidebar without this installed then you can see that the options are pretty limited we just have new file new folder things like that so now let's install sidebar enhancements and once that's finished installing if I click over here and do a secondary click in my sidebar now and you'll see that we have a lot more options for searching and opening files and things like that and I find these new options very useful okay so now let's install a package that's a very Python specific so this adds a lot of Python functionality to sublime text now this will allow you to set up code linting and auto formatting the ability to jump to function definitions and things like that now this package is called let me in click install package and this package is called anaconda so I'm going to go ahead and install that now this is different from the Anaconda Python distribution from continuum analytics this is just a sublime text package with the same name so let's install that and I'll show you a few of the specific settings that I use with that anaconda package now if you're ever unsure if you're installing the correct package or not then a lot of these have links to the github pages as well so you can always go to those pages to make sure that you're installing what you think you're installing okay so now that we have this installed let me show you some of the settings that I use specifically with this package now I'm going to pull back up my github page here and if I go back a page and you can see that I have anaconda sublime settings here as well so I'm going to go ahead and click on that now there's a lot less personal settings that I have here than my general sublime settings so I'm just going to go ahead and do the same thing and copy these and now we want to access the anaconda settings within sublime text now to get here we can go to sublime preferences package settings anaconda and then within anaconda I'll go to settings actually I'm going to open up settings default and then I'm also going to go to that same place preferences package settings anaconda and I'm also going to open up the settings user now I'm going to go ahead and set someone Tex and to split screen mode so that we can see both of these and on a Mac that is command option 2 and I'm sorry I'm not sure what that keyboard shortcut is on Windows now just like with our general settings we don't want to change the default settings we only want to change our user settings because the default settings can be overridden when we do updates and the user settings will always remain what we put in that file so we want to make our changes to the user settings so the user settings are currently blank so I'm going to go ahead and paste in what I got from the github file and then I'm going to go ahead and save those now just a quick side note if you want to change settings for any other packages then the same place that we located the Anaconda settings that's where you can locate settings for other packages as well and those were within package settings but anaconda are the ones that we're going to change right now now just like my general settings when I save a lot of changes to the settings I usually like to restart sublime text just to make sure that everything takes effect correctly I don't think you have to always do that but I do it just in case okay so we just restarted that now let's go ahead and take a look at the settings now there isn't a whole lot here basically I'm saying that I want Auto formatting turned on and what this does is it will auto format your code to be pet bait compliant if possible I like this because it keeps my code consistent so for example if I go here to my test module and I put some extra lines here between the methods and the properties and then I save this and you can see as soon as I save it it formatted back to the proper pep eight compliant settings there okay so back to the settings I also have some Auto formatting ignores in here now I actually don't remember what III o.9 is but I do remember that the e 501 is for maximum line length allowed now I probably should keep my lines shorter when coding but I go over that limit a lot and I don't like warnings to pop up all the time so if you have any auto formatting or pet bait warnings that you want to ignore then you can just put those within the auto format ignore and the pet bait ignore now really other than that I just have some lender settings here that are turned off now the reason I have those turned off is because it already marks the errors and the gutter and that's good enough for me and also you know this is less intrusive with these turned off so what I mean that it marks those in the gutter so let's say for example that I make a for loop here so I'll just do for num in and then do a list of one two three four and I'm going to forget to put a colon here and then I'm just going to print and instead of printing num I'm going to print n so I'm going to have the wrong variable name there and I'll save that so you can see with the linting that this anaconda package provides that it pops up with a ball here and the gutter telling me that something looks wrong now if I click anywhere in this line and look at the bottom left I'm sorry if this is a little small for your screen I don't know how to make this larger but down here it says invalid its syntax now after looking at that line for a little bit then you'll probably notice that the colon is missing so we'll go ahead and add that in and save it and now the warning that pops up down here is that we're supposed to have another line in between our class and the rest of the code so it's go ahead and save that now we have one more ball over here in the gutter and if I click on that line then it says undefined name in so then we'll realize that all instead of in that's supposed to be none and then when I save that you can see that the rest of those go away so it's nice having that linter watching everything in the background because we all make dumb mistakes like that and it's nice to have something that points those out now the reason I opened the default settings for anaconda here is just like with the general sublime settings it's nice to be able to look through all of the options that you have available and also all the documentation of what each of these options do so you can read through and know exactly what changes will do what and like I said these are just my personal preferences so I'd recommend you come in and kind of you know read around and try some different things for yourself and you know set this up how you prefer to have it set up in your sublime text okay so now that we're done with those settings I'm going to go ahead and make this non split screen again and to do that I hit command option and one to make this one pane and now I'm going to go ahead and close down all of the other windows or tabs that we have open here and just have my test module here now as far as the packages that I install that's basically it now I also mentioned that I'd go over build systems real quick and I think that if you're going to be working on multiple projects then you should become more familiar with how these work now like I said before this is currently set up as the automatic build system which runs your script with a default Python on your machine but if you want to use different versions of Python or virtual environments then you'll need to set up multiple build systems now I'm not going to go in depth about build systems in this video because I have a video specifically about build systems and I'll link to that in the description section below but I will show the quick process of how to set up a basic Python version 2 and Python version 3 build system now I also have these available on my github page as well so I'm going to go ahead and pull those up and go back and you can see that I have a Python sublime build system for Python 2 7 and 1 also for Python 3 5 I'm going to open these both up and their own tabs so you can see these files are very small and this one has the path to python 2 7 and this one has the path to python 3 5 now like i said i'm not going to go indepth as to what these build systems do i have a separate video on that but for now i'm just going to go ahead and copy this code from this Python to build system and now within sublime text I'm going to go up here to tools and build system and then down here to new build system and now look in here I'm just going to paste the code that I grabbed from the github page now within here I'll go ahead and save this and I'm going to save this as Python 2 7 dot sublime build now be sure that you leave that sublime build extension on there you don't want to accidentally remove that so I'm going to go ahead and save that now this popup that I just received here now these are what you'll get from time to time if you haven't purchased a license for sublime text so like I said you can use sublime text for an unlimited amount of time but if you don't purchase a license then you'll get these popups from time to time so for now I'm just going to go ahead and hit cancel on that okay so now we just created our Python 27 build system now let's do the same thing for Python 3 5 so I'm going to open up my github page here and copy those settings for the Python 3 5 build system then I'm just going to go through the same process I'm going to go to tools build system new build system and paste all of that code in there and save that now be careful not to overwrite the sublime build extension we just want to call this python 3.5 and save that so now that we've saved these build systems then we can go to tools build system and now we have this Python 2 7 and python 3 5 build system in here so if I choose this Python three five build system and now if I run my code here within sublime text now you could have gone to tools and build but I just use the keyboard shortcut for that you can see that now when we run our code now we're running this user local bin Python 3 5 and when we print out the version it says 3 5 and then it also runs the rest of our code down here at the bottom now like I said I do have a full video on those build systems so I would suggest watching that if you need to use Python from a specific virtual environment or anything like that ok so that basically does a prowl I set up my Python development environment now one more thing if you do experiment around with different packages and you don't like one that you've installed then you can easily remove a package by opening up your command palette so I'm going to do that with command shift P and instead of installing a package if you type remove and you can see remove package down here as well and if I click on remove package it'll show you all the packages that you've installed and you can remove any of those that you try out and end up not liking ok so I think that's going to do it for this video now this is everything specific to my Python development environment now if you look at the github page that I linked then you'll see that I also have some personalized keyboard shortcuts in there as well but I thought that those were you know so personal preference that no one would be too interested in those but if you'd like to see those shortcuts then you can view those you know at the same github page that I have linked so if you'd like to see some more videos on optimizing sublime text then you can view my playlist on my channel and I'll put a link to that in the description section below and if you're doing anything with web development related and you can watch my older sublime text setup video and I go over some additional packages that are good for you know linting HTML CSS JavaScript and things like that now I also have a video on how to set up the s UBL command line command in order to open files and folders and sublime text from your command line and I find that extremely useful and you can find those in the playlists that I just mentioned so I hope that people found this useful one of the most popular questions on the channel is you know what editor I'm using and how I set it up to run Python code so I hope now every one gets their setup exactly how they like now I've also had a lot of questions of people asking me for my opinion on Adam which is another editor that is becoming popular now I do like Adam and some good things is that you know it's completely free it's made by the people of github and it has a lot of support I've also put together a video on setting up by Python development environment within Adam also so that if anyone is interested in using that editor then they can see how that's done and I'll put a link to that in the description section below as well now if anyone is wondering if I would recommend sublime text or Adam and I would really just say that it depends now I think Adam is more userfriendly if you're just getting started out now if you don't want to purchase sublime text and I would say that Adam is a good option but I've been using sublime text for so long now that I'm more used to it and find myself always going back to it so you know really the choice is just up to you okay so I think that about does it if anyone has any questions about what we covered in this video then feel free to ask in the comment section below and I'll do my best to answer those now if you enjoy these tutorials and would like to support them then there's several ways you can do that now the easiest way is to simply like the video and give it a thumbs up and also it's a huge help to share these videos with anyone who you think would find them useful and if you have the means and you can contribute through patreon and there's a link to that page in the description section below be sure to
