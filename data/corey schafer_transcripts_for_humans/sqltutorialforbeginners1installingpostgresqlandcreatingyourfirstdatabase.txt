00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:01 - video we'll be learning the basics of
00:03 - SQL queries from the ground up now SQL
00:07 - is a great language for programmers to
00:09 - learn because it's hard to find a
00:11 - software system these days that doesn't
00:13 - talk to some type of database on the
00:15 - back end and not only is it a great
00:18 - thing to know but it's also a good
00:20 - starting point for certain people who
00:22 - are interested in getting started in
00:23 - computer science because in my opinion
00:26 - it's not nearly as difficult as learning
00:27 - the ins and outs of a programming
00:29 - language like Python or JavaScript or
00:32 - Java I mean there are just a limited
00:36 - number of commands and for most jobs
00:38 - you're going to be using the basics of
00:41 - SQL such as grabbing values from a
00:44 - database that meet a certain criteria or
00:46 - something like that
00:48 - now there are times when more advanced
00:50 - queries are going to be needed but if
00:52 - you learn the basics then it's going to
00:54 - put you in a position where you can do
00:56 - the majority of the queries and then you
00:59 - can learn the more advanced stuff
01:01 - whenever you're ready
01:02 - so with that said let's go ahead and get
01:05 - started so in this video I'm going to
01:07 - show you how I set up my environment so
01:08 - that I can run SQL queries and also
01:11 - we're going to create our first database
01:13 - and connect to that database now for
01:15 - these tutorials I'm going to be using a
01:17 - Postgres database now I'm on a Mac so
01:21 - I'll show you the process that I went
01:22 - through to set this up on my machine so
01:25 - first we're gonna need to install
01:26 - Postgres and on the Mac the easiest way
01:29 - to do this is with the Postgres dot app
01:32 - now if you search in google here for
01:35 - Postgres Mac the first result is the
01:38 - official website and if we open up that
01:40 - website you can see that they have a
01:42 - downloader here but then they also
01:44 - recommend the Postgres app here as a
01:46 - simple native Mac app that runs in the
01:49 - menu bar without the need of an
01:51 - installer and that's what I think is the
01:53 - easiest so I already have that pulled up
01:56 - here but if you run the search it's the
01:59 - second result here this Postgres dot app
02:02 - so now that we're in this website we can
02:05 - just download like this like any other
02:07 - application so let's go ahead and run
02:09 - that download so now once that download
02:12 - is finished let's go
02:13 - ahead and unzip this and now let's go
02:16 - ahead and move this application over to
02:19 - our Applications folder so I've already
02:22 - got that pulled up here I'm gonna drag
02:23 - that on over okay
02:25 - now with that Postgres app installed
02:27 - that's going to give us a Postgres
02:30 - server that we can talk to using the
02:33 - command line now the command line isn't
02:35 - the best way to visualize what's going
02:37 - on so we're also going to want a
02:39 - graphical interface program to inspect
02:43 - our databases now on the Postgres app
02:46 - website that i had pulled up earlier
02:49 - they list a few of their favorite GUI
02:52 - tools here so I'm going to click on this
02:53 - link and these are some of the GUI tools
02:56 - that they recommend now the tool that
02:58 - I'm going to be using for these
02:59 - tutorials is this one down here near the
03:02 - bottom called P sequel now if you prefer
03:04 - another option then go ahead and use
03:07 - what you like but the reason that I
03:09 - chose this program is because it's very
03:13 - clean it has a simple layout and it also
03:16 - has the ability to enlarge fonts which a
03:18 - few of the other one surprisingly didn't
03:20 - have now these features are important to
03:23 - me because recording these videos I
03:26 - don't want a lot of windows and stuff
03:28 - getting in the way and also I want to
03:30 - make the font large enough for you guys
03:32 - to be able to see what I'm typing so
03:35 - let's go ahead and download this program
03:38 - just like we did the other one and then
03:40 - we're also going to move that to our
03:42 - Applications folder so let's go ahead
03:44 - and unzip this and I will open up
03:47 - Applications folder again and just drag
03:50 - this over here okay now with both of
03:53 - these programs installed let's first
03:55 - start our sequel server by Ronit up by
03:57 - running this Postgres app so now we can
04:01 - see that our server is running because
04:03 - if we look up here in the top menu we
04:06 - can see that this little elephant icon
04:08 - here and it says running on port 5 4 3 2
04:11 - now it's also going to pop up this
04:13 - window here with this option to open P
04:16 - SQL and what that's going to do is it's
04:18 - going to open up the command line for us
04:21 - to start typing in commands now I know
04:23 - that the command line can be
04:25 - intimidating to some people but we're
04:26 - not going to be
04:27 - in here for long all we're gonna do is
04:29 - create a database that we can work with
04:31 - so to create this database it's just as
04:34 - simple as running the command create
04:37 - database and we're gonna call this
04:39 - sample underscore DB and we need to end
04:42 - this with a semicolon so let's go ahead
04:44 - and hit enter there and you can see that
04:46 - it says create database now there's a
04:49 - piece equal command here
04:50 - backslash L if we run that then we can
04:54 - view the databases that we have here and
04:56 - you can see that it created a few for us
04:58 - whenever we first installed the program
05:00 - but we can see here that we do have this
05:02 - sample underscore DB now to quit out of
05:06 - this command line we can do this
05:08 - backslash Q and it takes us back to our
05:10 - normal terminal so now I quit out of the
05:13 - command line there because we're not
05:15 - going to need to use it anymore because
05:17 - the command line it's not the prettiest
05:18 - way to see what's going on in our
05:20 - database so let's connect to the sample
05:23 - database that we just created using the
05:25 - P sequel application that we downloaded
05:28 - earlier so I'm going to go ahead and
05:29 - launch that now if you get this little
05:31 - error here cannot be opened because
05:33 - developer cannot be confirmed that's
05:35 - because I double clicked it's a weird
05:37 - thing with the Mac if you actually right
05:38 - click it and click open
05:40 - then it'll give you the option to
05:42 - override that and just open that up
05:44 - anyway now you'll see that with certain
05:45 - applications so now that we have this
05:47 - application opened up we're going to
05:49 - connect to our database and we're going
05:51 - to accept most of the defaults here you
05:54 - can see the port is 5 4 3 2 the same one
05:56 - that's listed whenever we right-click on
05:58 - our server it says it's running on port
06:00 - 5 4 3 2 the one thing that we are going
06:02 - to want to change here is that we're
06:04 - going to want to type in the database
06:06 - that we created so we called that sample
06:08 - underscore DB and now we can go ahead
06:11 - and connect to that database and we've
06:15 - successfully connected to the database
06:17 - now there's nothing here right now
06:19 - that's because we don't have any tables
06:22 - or any information within our database
06:24 - yet but we are in a position now to
06:26 - where we can begin writing a sequel
06:28 - command so for example if I wanted to
06:31 - create a table here I could create a
06:33 - table we'll just call this test
06:36 - underscore table now I'm not going to go
06:38 - too far into the details here because
06:39 - I'm going to
06:40 - go go into this further in another
06:43 - tutorial but if I just create a very
06:46 - basic table here with one column I can
06:49 - run that query and if i refresh our
06:51 - tables over here then we have a test
06:54 - table with one column called a so in
06:58 - this tutorial we installed a Postgres
07:01 - server we created the database and then
07:04 - we also installed a visual application
07:06 - to where we can visually inspect this
07:08 - database and we've also set it up to
07:11 - where we can now run SQL queries against
07:13 - this database so in the next tutorial
07:16 - we'll start adding tables to our
07:18 - database and we'll go over exactly how
07:20 - to do that so I hope this tutorial was
07:22 - useful for you guys if you have any
07:24 - questions just ask in the comment
07:25 - section below
07:26 - be sure to watch the other videos to get
07:29 - more in depth in the SQL commands and
07:32 - thank you all for watching
