00:00 - hey what's going on guys I wanted to do
00:02 - a walkthrough on how to set up a
00:03 - development environment in sublime text
00:05 - 3 I've already done a video on setting
00:07 - up a dev environment in sublime text 2 a
00:09 - lot of people are switching over to 3
00:11 - and a few of those steps and the process
00:13 - are different so I want to make a
00:15 - separate video for this as well so I'll
00:18 - show you how to get it installed how to
00:20 - get package control working how to
00:22 - install a few packages show a few
00:24 - packages that I like and also how to
00:26 - change around a few settings and things
00:27 - like that so let's go ahead and get
00:29 - started I'm over here at the sublime
00:31 - text website that is sublime text calm
00:33 - if we come down here into this download
00:35 - link this is a download link for sublime
00:37 - text too but they have a link here for
00:40 - sublime text 3 in beta so let's go ahead
00:43 - and just click on that and then choose
00:44 - the operating system that you have and
00:47 - go ahead and download it and now once
00:50 - that's finished downloading we'll go
00:51 - ahead and install it and I'm gonna drag
00:56 - this over to my Applications folder
01:00 - and I'm gonna go ahead and open this up
01:09 - ok now first thing I'm going to do here
01:12 - is drag in a sample project that I have
01:16 - that way we just have some files to work
01:18 - with this project has a sample HTML file
01:24 - a CSS file and a JavaScript file ok and
01:30 - let me make this text a little bit
01:31 - bigger so that you guys can see now the
01:35 - first thing that we're going to want to
01:36 - do is install package control if we go
01:38 - over here to Google you can google this
01:43 - sublime text package control and it's
01:46 - one of the first links at the top so
01:47 - just click on that then you'll see a
01:49 - link over here that says install now and
01:51 - we want to go to where it says sublime
01:54 - text 3 you have two options for spine
01:56 - text 2 & 3 let's be sure that we're on
01:59 - the three tab and highlight all this
02:01 - code here and copy that and then open up
02:04 - sublime and in our top menu here go to
02:08 - view show console and then paste the
02:11 - code that we got from that website and
02:13 - the console and hit enter and wait for
02:16 - that to finish and once that finishes
02:19 - we'll have to be sure to restart sublime
02:21 - text so I'm gonna go ahead and restart
02:27 - okay
02:28 - and to test if that worked let's hit
02:31 - command shift P and then type install
02:34 - and if we see this command here package
02:37 - control install package that means that
02:40 - we successfully installed package
02:41 - control so let's go ahead and install a
02:43 - package here just to get started with
02:46 - we'll do some color schemes there are
02:49 - some color schemes that I like by this
02:52 - guy here they'll rece color schemes
02:54 - there's a lot to choose from so go ahead
02:56 - and install that and you'll see in the
02:58 - bottom left it'll say installing package
03:00 - and whenever this finishes it will let
03:03 - you know okay and now that that package
03:06 - is finished we can go up here to sublime
03:09 - text preferences color scheme and then
03:13 - we can see all these color schemes here
03:15 - that we have to choose from so the color
03:18 - schemes are nice just for changing
03:22 - around changing up the color of your
03:24 - code but there's also entire themes that
03:27 - you can download that will not only
03:29 - change the color but it'll change the
03:31 - entire layout and look of the
03:32 - application so it'll change these folder
03:34 - icons over here it'll change the way
03:36 - that your tabs look up at the top so
03:38 - let's go ahead and install one of those
03:40 - so again hit command shift P type
03:43 - install and the theme I use is called
03:48 - pre-dawn and now whenever this package
03:53 - finishes you'll see that it pops up with
03:55 - this readme file sometimes whenever you
03:58 - install a package that has a couple of
04:00 - steps that you need to go through in
04:01 - order to get the package to work it'll
04:04 - come with a readme file to walk you
04:06 - through those steps so like for example
04:09 - here he says to activate the theme add
04:13 - to replace your current theme settings
04:14 - with the code below so we can just
04:16 - highlight this code copy that go up here
04:20 - to sublime text preferences and settings
04:23 - user we don't want to go to settings
04:25 - default because settings default is
04:27 - the default settings for sublime text
04:29 - and if we change anything in there if
04:32 - there's ever an update to the program
04:33 - and those could be overwritten so your
04:36 - safest bet is to always make sure that
04:39 - you make your custom changes to the
04:40 - settings user file so now that we're in
04:44 - here let's go ahead and highlight all
04:46 - this and erase that and paste in the
04:48 - code that he gave us for the theme and
04:51 - whenever we save we'll see those changes
04:53 - take effect okay now we can see that the
04:56 - theme changed the entire look of the
04:58 - application the tabs look different
04:59 - folders look different if we go back to
05:02 - the readme file he has some other
05:05 - settings that he's just adding in and
05:07 - these are settings I like as well so I'm
05:09 - going to go ahead and copy these and if
05:13 - we go to our user settings and put these
05:15 - within these brackets here and we're
05:17 - gonna have to put a comma here and paste
05:20 - those in and save okay and now you can
05:26 - see that the the tabs still look a
05:27 - little funny here and some of this text
05:30 - doesn't quite look right over here it's
05:31 - because if we go to the back to the
05:33 - readme file he has an important tag here
05:36 - that says make sure that you restart
05:37 - sublime after installing to make sure
05:39 - that the activation was successful so
05:41 - let's go ahead and restart sublime and
05:43 - bring it back up ok and now we can see
05:49 - that these tabs look right and all this
05:52 - text is fixed over here so now I'm going
05:57 - to blow this text up a little bit so
05:58 - that you can see it better and so now we
06:02 - have some ways to customize the
06:05 - application we can customize the colors
06:06 - or change the entire theme if we want
06:08 - but now let's try to install a few
06:10 - packages that will hopefully help you
06:12 - with your workflow so the first one I'd
06:15 - like to show you is one called bracket
06:16 - highlighter so if we get command shift P
06:18 - and type install and then
06:25 - type in bracket highlighter and install
06:27 - that now what this does is we're on our
06:32 - JavaScript file right now if we go to
06:34 - you just click on any of the brackets
06:37 - here and it'll tell you where over here
06:38 - in the gutter it'll show you where that
06:40 - bracket starts and where that bracket
06:41 - ends it's really mmm it's really useful
06:44 - for longer functions whenever you don't
06:47 - know or whenever you have nested
06:49 - functions and and sometimes these
06:52 - beginning and ending brackets can be
06:54 - hard to see it also works in your CSS
06:56 - files so you can see over here in the
06:58 - gutter it shows where these brackets
07:00 - begin and end and it also works in your
07:03 - HTML files if you click within a div
07:06 - here it'll show you where this tag
07:08 - begins and where this tag ends so it's a
07:12 - useful little plug-in for you know just
07:15 - a quick reference X package I'd like to
07:17 - show you is one called sidebar
07:19 - enhancements and I didn't show this in
07:21 - my sublime text to video because it's no
07:24 - longer supported in sublime text too so
07:26 - now it's only on sublime text 3 but by
07:31 - default if we right click over here and
07:34 - our application folders or any of these
07:36 - folders so you'll see that our options
07:39 - are pretty limited we only have a total
07:40 - of 6 here right now so let's go ahead
07:43 - and install the sidebar enhancements so
07:45 - that's command shift P install and this
07:50 - one's called sidebar enhancements go
07:53 - ahead and install that and now you'll
07:55 - now that that's installed you'll see if
07:57 - we right click over here we have a lot
07:59 - more options and in my opinion these are
08:02 - a lot more useful than the 6 that we had
08:06 - before so now moving on let's install
08:11 - one called sublime code Intel and what
08:13 - sublime code Intel does is it kind of
08:15 - adds some like some IDE style
08:17 - functionality to sublime text it'll add
08:20 - in some code completion and things like
08:22 - that
08:23 - so let's hit command shift P type
08:26 - install and this one is called sublime
08:30 - code Intel and this one can take a
08:35 - second to install ok when that's
08:37 - finished installing it will pop up
08:39 - this readme file here and this just kind
08:41 - of gives some information about the
08:43 - package what languages it supports it
08:47 - also comes with a few shortcuts that you
08:50 - can use in your application so let me go
08:52 - ahead and show you what this does so in
08:56 - my JavaScript file here I have this
08:59 - pestering variable right here if I come
09:02 - down a couple lines and do test string
09:05 - dot and whenever I hit the dot it'll
09:08 - come up with all these different methods
09:10 - that I can use and you know code
09:13 - completion is always useful just you
09:16 - know sometimes you have trouble
09:18 - remembering these off the top of your
09:20 - head so it's just nice to have those
09:21 - little hints from time to time
09:24 - okay the next package I'd like to show
09:27 - you is one called Emmet command shift P
09:30 - install package and this one is called
09:34 - Emmet okay now when this finishes
09:39 - installing it'll pop up with a readme
09:41 - file as well so let me show you what
09:44 - Emmet does now I'm not the best within
09:46 - it but basically what it is is it's a
09:49 - way to quickly scaffold out large chunks
09:54 - of code just using a little bit of text
09:57 - so in my HTML file here for example if I
09:59 - want three divs I can say div times
10:02 - three and hit tab and I'm gonna come out
10:04 - with those three divs if I wanted three
10:08 - divs with or say I wanted six Diggs with
10:11 - the class myclass
10:14 - then I could do div dot my class times
10:17 - six hit tab and it fills it all in for
10:20 - you
10:21 - there's tons of tutorials online I'm not
10:23 - going to go into Emmet in depth but some
10:26 - people are really good with this I'm not
10:27 - that great but even if you just learned
10:30 - a little bit it really does boost how
10:32 - fast you can scaffold out your code so
10:34 - it's very useful once you get the hang
10:36 - of it okay the last package I'm going to
10:39 - show you has changed pretty drastically
10:40 - from sublime text to to sublime text 3
10:42 - and that is the sublime linter and
10:45 - sublime text - all you had to do was
10:47 - install the sublime aligner package and
10:49 - it came with all these languages and
10:51 - what it would do
10:53 - it would anytime that you use those
10:55 - languages it would do contents checks
10:58 - and give you warnings and errors
11:00 - whenever you made mistakes in your code
11:02 - and it's very useful in sublime text 3 I
11:06 - think it works even better but the
11:09 - downside is that it's a little bit
11:10 - harder to install and you have to
11:12 - install each language individually so
11:15 - let me go ahead and walk through and
11:16 - show you how to get this installed
11:18 - before you install this you will need to
11:22 - have no js' installed and that's over
11:24 - here on ojs dot org slash download I
11:27 - already have it installed on my machine
11:28 - so I'm not gonna do that again
11:31 - but whenever you download it it will
11:33 - install the node package manager for you
11:35 - and you'll need that in order to install
11:38 - some of the languages that you can get
11:42 - with this linter so let's go ahead and
11:45 - install this so as usual hit command
11:48 - shift P and then type in install and
11:53 - this is called sublime linter now you
11:57 - want to be careful because there's one
11:59 - here called sublime lint and that's not
12:01 - the right one the main one is called
12:04 - sublime lint or interactive code linting
12:06 - framework for sublime text 3 so let's go
12:08 - ahead and install that now the
12:10 - difference in sublime text 3 is once
12:13 - that's installed it doesn't actually do
12:16 - anything by itself we have to install
12:18 - each language separately so there's a
12:22 - bunch of different languages to choose
12:23 - from but just for the sake of this
12:26 - tutorial I'm going to show you how to do
12:28 - jes hint which is a popular JavaScript
12:30 - linting library and CSS lamp for CSS so
12:36 - if I go over here to my browser and I
12:39 - type in sublime linter J's hint then the
12:46 - top link here is to their github page
12:49 - and we can see how to install this
12:52 - pretty much all you need to do is down
12:54 - here where it says install JSN by typing
12:57 - this into the terminal you can copy this
12:59 - code and you can open up your terminal
13:02 - and paste that in
13:06 - to install JSN and if you get an error
13:11 - you may need to do sudo before the
13:13 - command ok now once that's complete
13:18 - let's go ahead and pull up sublime text
13:21 - and now we're going to install the
13:23 - sublime lint or J s hint package so
13:26 - command shift P and install and then
13:31 - type in sublime linter and - and
13:35 - anything with the sublime Lenore - and
13:37 - then these languages after it these are
13:40 - ones that are actually supported by the
13:43 - sublime layer framework and you can also
13:45 - check to make sure if it's if it's
13:48 - official if by the github link because
13:50 - the github link while we speak github
13:52 - comm slash sublime winter slash and
13:55 - language so we want to find J s hint and
13:59 - that's this one right here so let's go
14:02 - ahead and install that and once that's
14:04 - installed we're gonna want to go ahead
14:06 - and restart sublime so let's take that
14:11 - down and bring it back up and now let's
14:14 - go over to our javascript file and see
14:16 - if that worked so say that you're doing
14:18 - some coding and you leave out a
14:20 - semicolon it'll pop up here with a
14:23 - warning on the side or if you misspelled
14:25 - a word it'll pop up with a bunch of
14:28 - warnings here and whenever you click on
14:30 - any of these warnings in the bottom left
14:32 - is where it tells you what it thinks the
14:34 - problem is and right here it says
14:35 - missing a semicolon you know down here
14:39 - it's you know function is not defined or
14:42 - if you see tion is not defined so you
14:46 - can see that you spelled something wrong
14:47 - so it's really useful to to have these
14:51 - code warnings and code errors displayed
14:54 - to you as you're going along and you
14:57 - know it really cuts down on mistakes now
15:00 - really fast I'll show you how to install
15:02 - one more of the sublime linear languages
15:04 - that way you can kind of get the hang of
15:05 - it and then install more on your own so
15:10 - now I'm going to show you how to do the
15:11 - one for CSS if we go over here to the
15:14 - CSS now you can see if we take out these
15:16 - semicolons it's not giving us any
15:18 - warnings on the side here that anything
15:19 - this code so if we go back to Google and
15:26 - instead of searching for J's hint we
15:29 - search for CSS lint and click on the top
15:33 - link here then it's pretty much the same
15:36 - thing we just want to do npm install
15:38 - global CSS let go back to terminal I'm
15:43 - going to do a sudo install and once that
15:49 - finishes we can open up sublime and
15:51 - actually install that linter package so
15:54 - they said command shift p5 install and
15:57 - that one is called sublime winner CSS
16:02 - lint and install that and once that's
16:05 - finished to be safe let's go ahead and
16:07 - restart sublime again and now you can
16:11 - see whenever we delete this semicolon or
16:15 - make any mistakes it will give us a few
16:18 - warnings and some errors here if we
16:20 - click on the warning in the bottom left
16:22 - it'll tell us that it was expecting a
16:24 - semicolon but it didn't find one so it's
16:28 - always nice to have those things
16:29 - watching in the background as you're
16:31 - doing coding because everybody makes you
16:34 - know silly mistakes here and there and
16:35 - it's nice to have something that pops up
16:38 - and says says hey this is wrong or you
16:42 - have a warning in this area so that's
16:45 - the last package I wanted to show you
16:47 - guys if you want to come in and to
16:50 - sublime text and start playing around
16:52 - with different packages if you ever want
16:54 - to remove a package it's really easy if
16:57 - you hit command shift P instead of
16:59 - typing and install you just type remove
17:01 - and then choose the option here for
17:05 - package control remove package and then
17:07 - click that and it'll show you all the
17:09 - packages that you have installed and
17:11 - then you can just come in here and
17:13 - remove any one that you want so I think
17:17 - that that about does it you guys have a
17:19 - way to customize the application and
17:22 - hopefully these packages will help you
17:25 - out with your workflow if you guys have
17:27 - any questions you know feel free to ask
17:29 - in the comment section be sure to
17:31 - subscribe for a future
17:32 - videos and hopefully this was useful for
17:35 - you guys and thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on guys I wanted to do a walkthrough on how to set up a development environment in sublime text 3 I've already done a video on setting up a dev environment in sublime text 2 a lot of people are switching over to 3 and a few of those steps and the process are different so I want to make a separate video for this as well so I'll show you how to get it installed how to get package control working how to install a few packages show a few packages that I like and also how to change around a few settings and things like that so let's go ahead and get started I'm over here at the sublime text website that is sublime text calm if we come down here into this download link this is a download link for sublime text too but they have a link here for sublime text 3 in beta so let's go ahead and just click on that and then choose the operating system that you have and go ahead and download it and now once that's finished downloading we'll go ahead and install it and I'm gonna drag this over to my Applications folder and I'm gonna go ahead and open this up ok now first thing I'm going to do here is drag in a sample project that I have that way we just have some files to work with this project has a sample HTML file a CSS file and a JavaScript file ok and let me make this text a little bit bigger so that you guys can see now the first thing that we're going to want to do is install package control if we go over here to Google you can google this sublime text package control and it's one of the first links at the top so just click on that then you'll see a link over here that says install now and we want to go to where it says sublime text 3 you have two options for spine text 2 & 3 let's be sure that we're on the three tab and highlight all this code here and copy that and then open up sublime and in our top menu here go to view show console and then paste the code that we got from that website and the console and hit enter and wait for that to finish and once that finishes we'll have to be sure to restart sublime text so I'm gonna go ahead and restart okay and to test if that worked let's hit command shift P and then type install and if we see this command here package control install package that means that we successfully installed package control so let's go ahead and install a package here just to get started with we'll do some color schemes there are some color schemes that I like by this guy here they'll rece color schemes there's a lot to choose from so go ahead and install that and you'll see in the bottom left it'll say installing package and whenever this finishes it will let you know okay and now that that package is finished we can go up here to sublime text preferences color scheme and then we can see all these color schemes here that we have to choose from so the color schemes are nice just for changing around changing up the color of your code but there's also entire themes that you can download that will not only change the color but it'll change the entire layout and look of the application so it'll change these folder icons over here it'll change the way that your tabs look up at the top so let's go ahead and install one of those so again hit command shift P type install and the theme I use is called predawn and now whenever this package finishes you'll see that it pops up with this readme file sometimes whenever you install a package that has a couple of steps that you need to go through in order to get the package to work it'll come with a readme file to walk you through those steps so like for example here he says to activate the theme add to replace your current theme settings with the code below so we can just highlight this code copy that go up here to sublime text preferences and settings user we don't want to go to settings default because settings default is the default settings for sublime text and if we change anything in there if there's ever an update to the program and those could be overwritten so your safest bet is to always make sure that you make your custom changes to the settings user file so now that we're in here let's go ahead and highlight all this and erase that and paste in the code that he gave us for the theme and whenever we save we'll see those changes take effect okay now we can see that the theme changed the entire look of the application the tabs look different folders look different if we go back to the readme file he has some other settings that he's just adding in and these are settings I like as well so I'm going to go ahead and copy these and if we go to our user settings and put these within these brackets here and we're gonna have to put a comma here and paste those in and save okay and now you can see that the the tabs still look a little funny here and some of this text doesn't quite look right over here it's because if we go to the back to the readme file he has an important tag here that says make sure that you restart sublime after installing to make sure that the activation was successful so let's go ahead and restart sublime and bring it back up ok and now we can see that these tabs look right and all this text is fixed over here so now I'm going to blow this text up a little bit so that you can see it better and so now we have some ways to customize the application we can customize the colors or change the entire theme if we want but now let's try to install a few packages that will hopefully help you with your workflow so the first one I'd like to show you is one called bracket highlighter so if we get command shift P and type install and then type in bracket highlighter and install that now what this does is we're on our JavaScript file right now if we go to you just click on any of the brackets here and it'll tell you where over here in the gutter it'll show you where that bracket starts and where that bracket ends it's really mmm it's really useful for longer functions whenever you don't know or whenever you have nested functions and and sometimes these beginning and ending brackets can be hard to see it also works in your CSS files so you can see over here in the gutter it shows where these brackets begin and end and it also works in your HTML files if you click within a div here it'll show you where this tag begins and where this tag ends so it's a useful little plugin for you know just a quick reference X package I'd like to show you is one called sidebar enhancements and I didn't show this in my sublime text to video because it's no longer supported in sublime text too so now it's only on sublime text 3 but by default if we right click over here and our application folders or any of these folders so you'll see that our options are pretty limited we only have a total of 6 here right now so let's go ahead and install the sidebar enhancements so that's command shift P install and this one's called sidebar enhancements go ahead and install that and now you'll now that that's installed you'll see if we right click over here we have a lot more options and in my opinion these are a lot more useful than the 6 that we had before so now moving on let's install one called sublime code Intel and what sublime code Intel does is it kind of adds some like some IDE style functionality to sublime text it'll add in some code completion and things like that so let's hit command shift P type install and this one is called sublime code Intel and this one can take a second to install ok when that's finished installing it will pop up this readme file here and this just kind of gives some information about the package what languages it supports it also comes with a few shortcuts that you can use in your application so let me go ahead and show you what this does so in my JavaScript file here I have this pestering variable right here if I come down a couple lines and do test string dot and whenever I hit the dot it'll come up with all these different methods that I can use and you know code completion is always useful just you know sometimes you have trouble remembering these off the top of your head so it's just nice to have those little hints from time to time okay the next package I'd like to show you is one called Emmet command shift P install package and this one is called Emmet okay now when this finishes installing it'll pop up with a readme file as well so let me show you what Emmet does now I'm not the best within it but basically what it is is it's a way to quickly scaffold out large chunks of code just using a little bit of text so in my HTML file here for example if I want three divs I can say div times three and hit tab and I'm gonna come out with those three divs if I wanted three divs with or say I wanted six Diggs with the class myclass then I could do div dot my class times six hit tab and it fills it all in for you there's tons of tutorials online I'm not going to go into Emmet in depth but some people are really good with this I'm not that great but even if you just learned a little bit it really does boost how fast you can scaffold out your code so it's very useful once you get the hang of it okay the last package I'm going to show you has changed pretty drastically from sublime text to to sublime text 3 and that is the sublime linter and sublime text all you had to do was install the sublime aligner package and it came with all these languages and what it would do it would anytime that you use those languages it would do contents checks and give you warnings and errors whenever you made mistakes in your code and it's very useful in sublime text 3 I think it works even better but the downside is that it's a little bit harder to install and you have to install each language individually so let me go ahead and walk through and show you how to get this installed before you install this you will need to have no js' installed and that's over here on ojs dot org slash download I already have it installed on my machine so I'm not gonna do that again but whenever you download it it will install the node package manager for you and you'll need that in order to install some of the languages that you can get with this linter so let's go ahead and install this so as usual hit command shift P and then type in install and this is called sublime linter now you want to be careful because there's one here called sublime lint and that's not the right one the main one is called sublime lint or interactive code linting framework for sublime text 3 so let's go ahead and install that now the difference in sublime text 3 is once that's installed it doesn't actually do anything by itself we have to install each language separately so there's a bunch of different languages to choose from but just for the sake of this tutorial I'm going to show you how to do jes hint which is a popular JavaScript linting library and CSS lamp for CSS so if I go over here to my browser and I type in sublime linter J's hint then the top link here is to their github page and we can see how to install this pretty much all you need to do is down here where it says install JSN by typing this into the terminal you can copy this code and you can open up your terminal and paste that in to install JSN and if you get an error you may need to do sudo before the command ok now once that's complete let's go ahead and pull up sublime text and now we're going to install the sublime lint or J s hint package so command shift P and install and then type in sublime linter and and anything with the sublime Lenore and then these languages after it these are ones that are actually supported by the sublime layer framework and you can also check to make sure if it's if it's official if by the github link because the github link while we speak github comm slash sublime winter slash and language so we want to find J s hint and that's this one right here so let's go ahead and install that and once that's installed we're gonna want to go ahead and restart sublime so let's take that down and bring it back up and now let's go over to our javascript file and see if that worked so say that you're doing some coding and you leave out a semicolon it'll pop up here with a warning on the side or if you misspelled a word it'll pop up with a bunch of warnings here and whenever you click on any of these warnings in the bottom left is where it tells you what it thinks the problem is and right here it says missing a semicolon you know down here it's you know function is not defined or if you see tion is not defined so you can see that you spelled something wrong so it's really useful to to have these code warnings and code errors displayed to you as you're going along and you know it really cuts down on mistakes now really fast I'll show you how to install one more of the sublime linear languages that way you can kind of get the hang of it and then install more on your own so now I'm going to show you how to do the one for CSS if we go over here to the CSS now you can see if we take out these semicolons it's not giving us any warnings on the side here that anything this code so if we go back to Google and instead of searching for J's hint we search for CSS lint and click on the top link here then it's pretty much the same thing we just want to do npm install global CSS let go back to terminal I'm going to do a sudo install and once that finishes we can open up sublime and actually install that linter package so they said command shift p5 install and that one is called sublime winner CSS lint and install that and once that's finished to be safe let's go ahead and restart sublime again and now you can see whenever we delete this semicolon or make any mistakes it will give us a few warnings and some errors here if we click on the warning in the bottom left it'll tell us that it was expecting a semicolon but it didn't find one so it's always nice to have those things watching in the background as you're doing coding because everybody makes you know silly mistakes here and there and it's nice to have something that pops up and says says hey this is wrong or you have a warning in this area so that's the last package I wanted to show you guys if you want to come in and to sublime text and start playing around with different packages if you ever want to remove a package it's really easy if you hit command shift P instead of typing and install you just type remove and then choose the option here for package control remove package and then click that and it'll show you all the packages that you have installed and then you can just come in here and remove any one that you want so I think that that about does it you guys have a way to customize the application and hopefully these packages will help you out with your workflow if you guys have any questions you know feel free to ask in the comment section be sure to subscribe for a future videos and hopefully this was useful for you guys and thanks for watching
