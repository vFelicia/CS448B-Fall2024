00:00 - hey how's it going everybody in this
00:02 - video I wanted to give a quick update of
00:03 - where we currently are with this channel
00:05 - also wanted to go over my plans for
00:06 - future tutorials so that you all know
00:08 - what videos you can expect to see in the
00:10 - near future and lastly I also thought it
00:12 - would be fun to do some kind of giveaway
00:14 - for subscribers and we'll go over the
00:16 - details of that at the end of this video
00:18 - so the channel is rapidly approaching
00:20 - 5000 subscribers and it looks like it's
00:23 - going to get there in another day or two
00:25 - so first of all I just want to say thank
00:28 - you when I first started making these
00:30 - videos I didn't really know what to
00:31 - expect but the entire experience so far
00:34 - has been nothing but positive I get a
00:37 - lot of feedback from you all and
00:38 - honestly I can't think of hardly any
00:41 - negative comments that I've received
00:42 - even when somebody writes in with
00:44 - constructive criticism it's always
00:46 - extremely respectful and meant to be
00:49 - helpful and I just wanted you all to
00:50 - know how much I appreciate that and also
00:53 - while I'm thinking people I especially
00:55 - wanted to thank people who have
00:56 - contributed so far through my patreon
00:58 - page there's a lot I want to do to
01:00 - improve this channel in the future and
01:01 - it's so motivating to see this kind of
01:04 - support early on in the process so thank
01:06 - you all so much for that now as far as
01:09 - channel updates go I've had a few
01:11 - requests from people saying that I
01:13 - should put together a list of tutorials
01:15 - that I'm currently working on and make
01:17 - release schedule for when you can expect
01:19 - those classes now the reason I haven't
01:21 - done this so far is because sometimes
01:23 - something will come up with my full-time
01:24 - job that prevents me from devoting as
01:27 - much time to these videos as I'd like
01:29 - and I was worried I would announce to
01:31 - you all that I would have certain
01:32 - classes ready at a certain time and
01:34 - something would come up where I wouldn't
01:36 - be able to meet that deadline but I do
01:38 - like the idea of having a list of videos
01:40 - that I'm currently working on so I'm
01:42 - going to try to keep a small updated
01:44 - list here on my website and if you don't
01:47 - know my website is corey ms calm and
01:51 - that's c.o.r.e why ms calm and you can
01:56 - see here on my website that i have added
01:58 - a small list of tutorials coming soon to
02:01 - my sidebar now don't worry if you've
02:03 - suggested a video that you don't see
02:05 - here on this list I have a separate
02:07 - personal list that i keep on my computer
02:10 - locally with hundreds of video ideas
02:12 - that I plan on
02:13 - getting to as soon as possible but these
02:15 - are the videos that I've actually
02:16 - started writing sample code for and
02:19 - writing scripts for and things like that
02:20 - now I know there are only two Python
02:23 - videos currently on this list but don't
02:26 - worry I'm still going to focus heavily
02:28 - on Python tutorials since that seems to
02:30 - be the most popular videos on the
02:32 - channel but I've also wanted to start
02:35 - adding more command line tutorials and
02:36 - the ones that I have listed here I've
02:39 - been meaning to finish for some time and
02:41 - they shouldn't take that long to knock
02:43 - out but definitely expect to see more
02:45 - advanced Python tutorials coming soon as
02:48 - well now I would also like to start
02:51 - doing more videos on other tools that
02:53 - you'll likely be using in the industry
02:55 - so for example I'd like to put together
02:56 - some videos on continuous integration
02:59 - specifically how to install and use
03:01 - Jenkins I'd also like to do some more
03:04 - advanced get tutorials and also some
03:07 - more advanced SQL and database tutorials
03:09 - I could even do some SQL alchemy with in
03:13 - Python as well but this here is just a
03:16 - small list that I threw together on my
03:17 - website for now and i'll be adding and
03:20 - removing from this as time goes on and
03:22 - as always your feedback is always
03:24 - welcome so if there is something in
03:26 - particular you would like me to cover
03:27 - then just leave me a comment or send me
03:30 - a message and I'll write it down on my
03:32 - list of topics okay and lastly along
03:35 - with the channel update I thought it
03:36 - might be fun to also do a giveaway so I
03:39 - have a lot of programming books that
03:41 - helped me out a lot whenever I was first
03:43 - getting started and I thought instead of
03:45 - these books just sitting on my shelf
03:47 - that they would be more useful if I gave
03:49 - them away to subscribers so this time
03:52 - the book i'll be giving away is my own
03:54 - copy of the pragmatic programmer and you
03:57 - can see down here on my sidebar that i
03:59 - have this listed as one of my
04:01 - recommended books on my website now you
04:03 - also see this on a lot of lists as one
04:05 - of the top books to read when learning
04:06 - software development I enjoyed it a lot
04:09 - and hopefully someone else will find it
04:11 - useful as well so the value of the book
04:13 - on Amazon is currently about $35 and it
04:17 - looks like they're temporarily out of
04:19 - stock here now this is my used copy so
04:22 - it does have a little bit of wear to it
04:23 - but nothing too bad now I know a
04:25 - programming book isn't the most
04:27 - exciting giveaway that you've ever seen
04:29 - it's not like a new macbook or something
04:32 - like that but this is the first time
04:33 - I've ever done one of these so we'll see
04:36 - how this goes and if it's pretty simple
04:38 - process then maybe we can do some more
04:40 - valuable giveaways in the future so in
04:43 - order to enter for this giveaway you can
04:45 - just go here to my website and at the
04:47 - top I have this link here for the
04:49 - giveaway and the URL to that page is
04:52 - corey ms calm ford / giveaway now i'm
04:56 - using a third-party service here that
04:58 - will handle all of the entries for me
05:00 - and randomly choose a winner and things
05:02 - like that and there are multiple ways
05:04 - that you can enter if you're a
05:05 - subscriber to the channel then you
05:08 - automatically get an entry and you can
05:10 - see here that you can get additional
05:11 - entries by visiting my different social
05:14 - media pages and referring friends to
05:17 - enter the competition as well so I
05:19 - believe that this is set up to end on
05:21 - May fifteenth so you can see here that
05:23 - there are 13 days left but by the time I
05:26 - post this video the robber be 12 days
05:29 - left to join so just so y'all know
05:31 - anytime I release a video in the first
05:33 - week or so there are usually only a
05:35 - couple of hundred views and I'd say that
05:37 - the percentage of people who watch this
05:39 - and actually inner will be fairly low so
05:43 - if you go here and enter then I'd say
05:45 - that your chances of winning are going
05:47 - to be pretty good so like I said we'll
05:49 - see how this goes and if it goes well
05:50 - then maybe we can do these giveaways
05:52 - from time to time when we have channel
05:56 - updates and things like that so I think
05:58 - that's going to do it for this video
05:59 - thank you all again so much I'm really
06:01 - excited that the channel has reached
06:03 - 5000 subscribers and I hope that
06:05 - everyone continues to enjoy and learn
06:07 - from these tutorials and you can expect
06:09 - many more in the near future so thanks
06:12 - again and thank you all for watching
