00:00 - hey everybody how's it going I've been
00:02 - getting a lot of questions from people
00:03 - lately asking me how I customized my
00:06 - terminal and if I would do a video
00:08 - showing how to set it up so in the next
00:10 - few videos I'm going to show you how you
00:12 - can customize your own terminal now
00:14 - there's a lot of different
00:15 - customizations that you can make which
00:17 - will help you be more productive and
00:19 - also it's just nice to set up an
00:21 - environment that is unique and also
00:23 - pleasant to work with on a daily basis
00:25 - so some of the customizations that you
00:27 - can make you can simply just change the
00:29 - colors like I've done here you can add
00:32 - aliases which will allow you to have
00:34 - shortcuts for certain commands you can
00:36 - add a get prompt which will if you're
00:40 - inside a git repository it'll show you
00:42 - what get branch you're on you can also
00:45 - add get Auto completion and you can also
00:47 - export certain variables like if you
00:50 - need to change your path variable you
00:51 - can do that as well so all kinds of
00:52 - stuff so in this video to get started
00:54 - out we're going to be taking a look at
00:56 - the files that we need to edit that will
00:59 - allow us to customize our terminal so
01:01 - first of all why do we need to edit
01:03 - files you may have seen people customize
01:05 - their terminal just by typing directly
01:07 - into it so for example I could customize
01:11 - my prompt in the terminal by typing
01:13 - something like PS 1 equals and I'll just
01:18 - do a custom with an arrow and a space
01:21 - here and if I run that you can see that
01:24 - this did customize my prompt so I have a
01:26 - custom prompt here now that I just
01:28 - changed from within the terminal but the
01:30 - problem is that this is only temporary
01:32 - so if I quit out of the terminal and
01:35 - open this back up now you can see that
01:37 - it's back to the way that it was so we
01:40 - need to add these customizations to
01:41 - specific files so that they are applied
01:44 - every time we run the terminal so the
01:46 - files we're going to edit are the dot
01:48 - ashe underscore profile and the dot bash
01:51 - RC files located in our home directory
01:53 - and these are dot files so if I do an LS
01:57 - on my home directory then I need to put
02:00 - in this a tag here so that it shows all
02:04 - of the dot files and if I scroll up here
02:06 - to my dot files you can see that I have
02:08 - a dot bash underscore profile and also
02:11 - have a dot bash our
02:13 - see now if you don't see these files and
02:15 - that's okay you can just create them if
02:17 - they don't already exist so I'm going to
02:19 - go ahead and get rid of the
02:20 - customizations that I've made to my
02:21 - terminal and the way that I'm going to
02:23 - do that is that I'm just going to move
02:26 - those Bosch files into a temporary
02:29 - folder for now so I'm going to move my
02:31 - Bosch underscore profile into dot files
02:35 - so I will move that there and I'll also
02:38 - do that with the Ashe RC file to that
02:41 - dot files is just a temporary directory
02:43 - that I made so that could stash these
02:45 - away somewhere for now so now if I quit
02:47 - terminal and I open it back up then my
02:51 - customizations should be gone so you can
02:53 - see here all the colors that I had
02:54 - previously aren't here anymore
02:56 - and if I was to go into a git repository
02:58 - or something like that then it wouldn't
03:00 - show me my git branch or apply any of
03:02 - the other customizations that I've made
03:04 - so now that I have my new terminal
03:06 - window open up here I'm going to
03:08 - recreate my Ashe underscore profile and
03:11 - my bash RC file now I'm not going to go
03:14 - into too much detail about why we need
03:17 - these two files instead of just one but
03:20 - long story short the bash underscore
03:23 - profile is a file that is used for
03:25 - something called a login shell and the
03:27 - bash RC file is used for non login
03:30 - shells so I'm not going to go into the
03:32 - exact differences in this video but let
03:34 - me go ahead and just recreate these and
03:36 - we can kind of take a look at what I
03:38 - mean by that so I'm going to go ahead
03:40 - and create that
03:41 - bash underscore profile and then I'll
03:44 - also create a bash RC file so now I'm
03:47 - going to open up each one of these and
03:49 - sublime text and add an echo statement
03:52 - so that you can see when each one is
03:54 - executed so now I'm within my bash
03:56 - underscore profile and what I'm going to
03:58 - do is I'm just going to put in an echo
04:00 - statement and I'm going to echo out from
04:03 - bash underscore profile and I'll go
04:07 - ahead and save that now if I go back to
04:09 - my terminal here I'm also going to open
04:11 - up my bash RC file within sublime and in
04:15 - this case I'm just going to do an echo
04:17 - and I'm going to do from bash RC and
04:20 - save that so now let me go ahead and
04:22 - quit out of terminal and open it back up
04:25 - and
04:26 - see which one of these files gets
04:28 - executed so if I open terminal back up
04:30 - you can see that it ran our code from
04:32 - bash underscore profile but not from the
04:35 - batch RC file and that's because this is
04:38 - a login shell on the Mac and it is run
04:41 - every time we open up a new terminal now
04:44 - I don't think that's exactly the case on
04:45 - Linux but I'm not 100% sure about that
04:47 - so these login shells are also run
04:50 - anytime you SSH into a machine and
04:52 - things like that
04:53 - now the bash RC file is run when we
04:56 - start a non login or a sub shell so if I
04:59 - just type in bash here then what it's
05:02 - going to do is it's going to start a sub
05:03 - shell and you can see as soon as I start
05:05 - that sub shell it runs the echo
05:07 - statement that we put into our bash RC
05:09 - file hear this from bash RC now this is
05:13 - different for some people but I
05:14 - personally like my customizations to be
05:17 - the same whether I am in a login shell
05:20 - or a non login shell so there's a simple
05:23 - trick that we can do which will allow us
05:25 - to modify just a single file and it will
05:28 - be applied to all of our shells so to do
05:31 - this I'm going to open up my bash
05:33 - underscore profile again in sublime text
05:37 - and all I'm going to do is call my bash
05:40 - RC file from within this file so to do
05:44 - this we're just going to type in this
05:46 - command and you can find this online and
05:47 - copy and paste it if you want but I can
05:49 - type
05:50 - if bracket F dash F and then I'm going
05:54 - to say within my home directory here dot
05:56 - bash RC and then close that bracket off
06:00 - then and source dot H RC and then to
06:07 - close out that if statement we can just
06:09 - type in Fi okay so basically what this
06:12 - code is saying it's saying that if the
06:14 - bash RC file exists then execute the
06:18 - code in that file so now imagine what's
06:21 - going on here so as soon as we open up a
06:23 - login shell and it runs the code that's
06:26 - it within our bash underscore profile
06:28 - it's going to run this code which in
06:31 - turn runs the bash RC file and if you
06:34 - run a sub shell then it's also going to
06:36 - run the bash RC file so now we can add
06:38 - all of our customers a
06:39 - to our bash RC file and not really have
06:42 - to worry about our bash underscore
06:43 - profile anymore so they actually see
06:46 - this at work I can go back over here to
06:48 - my terminal and if I quit out of the
06:51 - terminal and I'll close that and if I
06:53 - reopen it you can see here now that it's
06:55 - echoing the statement from our bash RC
06:58 - file which is what we wanted and if I
07:01 - was to run a sub shell here with bash
07:03 - then you can see again that it ran the
07:06 - code from the bash RC file so now we can
07:10 - add all of our customizations to a
07:12 - single place so if I was to open up the
07:15 - bash RC file in sublime text and I was
07:19 - to do something instead like I did
07:20 - earlier of PS 1 equals and then I'll
07:24 - just do the same thing custom arrow with
07:26 - the space and if I save that and then
07:29 - open back up my terminal again I'll
07:33 - close out of that and open it up now you
07:35 - can see I have a custom prompt here and
07:37 - if I run a sub shell then I still have
07:39 - that custom prompt so I think that's
07:41 - going to do it for this video now we
07:43 - have our files set up in such a way that
07:45 - we can add all of our customizations to
07:47 - one file and in the following videos
07:49 - I'll show you more specifically exactly
07:52 - how I customized my own terminal and it
07:54 - can give you some ideas of how you want
07:55 - to customize yours as well so I hope
07:57 - this video was useful I hope it helps
07:59 - you somewhat understand the difference
08:01 - between the bash underscore profile and
08:03 - the bash RC files but if you do have any
08:06 - questions just ask in the comment
08:07 - section below be sure to subscribe for
08:10 - future videos and thank you all for

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody how's it going I've been getting a lot of questions from people lately asking me how I customized my terminal and if I would do a video showing how to set it up so in the next few videos I'm going to show you how you can customize your own terminal now there's a lot of different customizations that you can make which will help you be more productive and also it's just nice to set up an environment that is unique and also pleasant to work with on a daily basis so some of the customizations that you can make you can simply just change the colors like I've done here you can add aliases which will allow you to have shortcuts for certain commands you can add a get prompt which will if you're inside a git repository it'll show you what get branch you're on you can also add get Auto completion and you can also export certain variables like if you need to change your path variable you can do that as well so all kinds of stuff so in this video to get started out we're going to
