00:00 - hey what's going on everybody this is
00:01 - going to be a super quick video um i
00:04 - just made a video on how to use a get
00:07 - diff tool and the git diff tool that i
00:09 - used was called diff merge
00:12 - and i wanted to show you a problem that
00:14 - i ran into whenever i was recording that
00:15 - video
00:17 - if i do a
00:18 - if i open up
00:19 - diff merge by using the get diff tool
00:22 - that i showed in the previous video
00:24 - by default you can see when this opens
00:27 - up this text is extremely small i think
00:30 - this is like a 10
00:32 - point font or something like that and on
00:34 - the latest version of mac if you go in
00:36 - here and you try to
00:39 - change this font
00:40 - so i'll go over here to window font and
00:43 - choose a different font and you can see
00:45 - here that the program crashes and it
00:47 - won't allow you to do it no matter no
00:49 - matter how many times you do this it's
00:51 - going to crash
00:52 - so whenever i was looking for a solution
00:55 - to that problem i couldn't really find
00:57 - too many good answers online and i
00:59 - finally found one but it was kind of
01:01 - hidden in some forums so i figured i'd
01:02 - make a quick video about it
01:04 - so to change this problem
01:07 - you can't
01:09 - change the font using the window you
01:11 - have to use this kind of work around
01:13 - here but if you use this command here
01:16 - and open up the diff merge preferences
01:19 - so just paste this into your terminal
01:21 - and hit enter
01:22 - and you'll see that'll pop open in text
01:25 - edit and then these lines right here
01:28 - will change the font you need this file
01:31 - in brackets and then font equals and
01:33 - then this 22 is the font size i'm not
01:36 - sure what the 76 is but
01:39 - i saw it there in the in the work around
01:41 - so i just included it in
01:44 - so i just put this here under license
01:47 - and paste that in
01:48 - and save it
01:50 - and exit out of that and so now if i go
01:53 - back up here and run the gif get diff
01:55 - tool again
01:56 - now you can see
01:58 - that the font is a 22 size font so you
02:01 - guys can
02:02 - change that font size to whatever is it
02:04 - you want so yep hopefully this quick tip
02:07 - was useful
