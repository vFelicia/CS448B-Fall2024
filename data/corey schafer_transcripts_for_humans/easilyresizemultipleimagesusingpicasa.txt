00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to
00:04 - resize multiple images all at once
00:07 - really quickly and easily using Google
00:10 - Picasa if you've never used Picasa
00:14 - before and you want to download it you
00:16 - can easily find it over here on the
00:18 - internet it is at
00:21 - picasa.google.com
00:23 - also if
00:25 - using the terminal is more your style I
00:29 - also have a video on how to quickly
00:32 - resize lots of images just using the
00:35 - terminal but in this video we're going
00:37 - to be focusing on using Picasa so this
00:41 - is what Picasa looks like whenever you
00:43 - first open it up what you might see at
00:46 - first is it may ask you what folders you
00:49 - want to connect to Picasa if it doesn't
00:52 - ask you then you can get to that by
00:54 - going up here to tools and then folder
00:57 - manager okay so this might be what you
00:59 - see whenever you first open up Picasa so
01:02 - the folder that we want to connect I
01:04 - have a folder on my desktop and it is
01:07 - this large folder and I will just do
01:09 - scan once and click ok
01:12 - now really quickly on my desktop let me
01:15 - open up this large folder and I'll show
01:16 - you what's in here if I highlight all
01:19 - these pictures and open these up in
01:20 - preview you can see that all these
01:22 - pictures are really large high
01:24 - definition pictures you know if we
01:27 - wanted to put this on a website maybe we
01:29 - would want the large high definition
01:31 - pictures for the detailed View and then
01:34 - maybe we would want some medium to small
01:37 - pictures for maybe like a thumbnail view
01:40 - or something like that so that's one of
01:43 - the reasons that you might want to
01:44 - resize lots of images at once okay so
01:47 - now we have all of these images loaded
01:50 - into Picasa and we can see our folder
01:52 - over here to the left and we have all of
01:54 - our images here so resizing these is
01:57 - super easy all we got to do is highlight
02:00 - all of our images
02:01 - and then come up here to file and then
02:05 - we want to come down here to export
02:08 - picture to folder click on that and now
02:11 - to this export location we're already on
02:14 - our desktop let's go to browse let's go
02:16 - to desktop let's choose the desktop and
02:19 - instead of large let's call this
02:22 - medium
02:23 - and then image size we want to resize to
02:27 - let's go ahead and stick with 640
02:29 - picture pixels that's a good
02:30 - medium-sized picture image quality we'll
02:33 - just keep that automatic and we won't
02:35 - add an add a watermark right now but you
02:37 - can do that if you want to so let's go
02:39 - ahead and click export and you can see
02:41 - down here that it's exporting all the
02:43 - pictures to the desktop
02:45 - and then it'll open up the desktop and
02:47 - finder whenever that finishes up but I'm
02:49 - just going to close this down and then
02:51 - show you that the folder did pop up here
02:54 - on the desktop so if I double click on
02:56 - that then we can see all the images are
02:59 - here I can highlight all these open them
03:02 - up in preview and you can see that they
03:04 - all are
03:06 - 640 pixels so now you know if you wanted
03:10 - we could do this again if you wanted
03:13 - a really small 300 Pixel picture we
03:16 - could do the same thing export instead
03:18 - of large we'll call this small instead
03:21 - of 640
03:22 - call this 300 export that and it's as
03:26 - easy as that it's super fast to resize
03:29 - the pictures this way so close that down
03:32 - and open up our small directory and you
03:36 - know we can
03:37 - open these up and look through those and
03:39 - they are all sized to 300 pixels
03:42 - so if resizing your pictures was all
03:46 - that you wanted and needed to do then at
03:48 - this point you would be done you have
03:50 - your three folders all of your large
03:52 - medium and small pictures
03:54 - one thing additional that you might want
03:57 - to do is rename the photos and there's
04:00 - not so much an easy way to do that but I
04:03 - figured it's kind of outside the scope
04:05 - of this video but I will show you a way
04:07 - to do that anyway I'm just in case you
04:10 - need to do it it's something that a lot
04:12 - of people need to do because once they
04:15 - have their different size photos
04:17 - they want to rename those to the
04:19 - specific size of their image so that
04:23 - they can distinguish between the
04:26 - different sizes maybe on their web
04:27 - server for the website or something like
04:29 - that so over here in my terminal I'm
04:31 - going to a CD into my small directory
04:35 - that is this directory here on my
04:38 - desktop
04:40 - and then I'm just going to go up to this
04:43 - command that I ran earlier
04:46 - so you don't want to run this command
04:49 - unless you know for sure that you're in
04:51 - the correct directory because this will
04:54 - overwrite the names of files so only do
04:57 - this if you're sure 100 that you're in
05:00 - the correct directory and we are here
05:02 - we're in the small directory on the
05:04 - desktop
05:05 - and what this is doing is it's finding
05:09 - within the current directory all the
05:11 - files which in this case it's all JPEG
05:15 - files and then we're going to execute
05:16 - this bash command where we're going to
05:19 - move but pretty much move is the same
05:22 - thing as rename so we're going to rename
05:24 - this file we're going to disregard the
05:27 - extension here Pack 1 size 300 and then
05:31 - also add on the dot JPEG to the end
05:35 - again since we disregarded it earlier so
05:38 - if I hit enter there and then I run an
05:40 - LS command which just lists all the
05:42 - files into directory now you can see
05:45 - that all of our small images now have
05:47 - this 300 packed onto the end of the
05:50 - image name before these were just the
05:54 - same names as the large and medium size
05:57 - images and now they have this Dash 300
05:59 - on the end to distinguish that they are
06:02 - 300 pixels wide well that about does it
06:05 - for this video like I said if you'd like
06:08 - to see another video on how to do this
06:10 - image resizing within the terminal I do
06:12 - have a video on that and I will put the
06:14 - link in the description below but other
06:17 - than that I hope that this video was
06:19 - useful for you guys if you have any
06:21 - questions feel free to ask in the
06:23 - comments below be sure to subscribe for
06:26 - future videos and tutorials and thank

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody how's it going in this video I'm going to show you how to resize multiple images all at once really quickly and easily using Google Picasa if you've never used Picasa before and you want to download it you can easily find it over here on the internet it is at picasa.google.com also if using the terminal is more your style I also have a video on how to quickly resize lots of images just using the terminal but in this video we're going to be focusing on using Picasa so this is what Picasa looks like whenever you first open it up what you might see at first is it may ask you what folders you want to connect to Picasa if it doesn't ask you then you can get to that by going up here to tools and then folder manager okay so this might be what you see whenever you first open up Picasa so the folder that we want to connect I have a folder on my desktop and it is this large folder and I will just do scan once and click ok now really quickly on my desktop let me open up this large folder and I'll show you what's in here if I highlight all these pictures and open these up in preview you can see that all these pictures are really large high definition pictures you know if we wanted to put this on a website maybe we would want the large high definition pictures for the detailed View and then maybe we would want some medium to small pictures for maybe like a thumbnail view or something like that so that's one of the reasons that you might want to resize lots of images at once okay so now we have all of these images loaded into Picasa and we can see our folder over here to the left and we have all of our images here so resizing these is super easy all we got to do is highlight all of our images and then come up here to file and then we want to come down here to export picture to folder click on that and now to this export location we're already on our desktop let's go to browse let's go to desktop let's choose the desktop and instead of large let's call this medium and then image size we want to resize to let's go ahead and stick with 640 picture pixels that's a good mediumsized picture image quality we'll just keep that automatic and we won't add an add a watermark right now but you can do that if you want to so let's go ahead and click export and you can see down here that it's exporting all the pictures to the desktop and then it'll open up the
