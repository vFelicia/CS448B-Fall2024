00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be learning
00:03 - how to install Ubuntu Linux on
00:04 - VirtualBox so I plan on doing more Linux
00:07 - tutorials in the near future so if you'd
00:09 - like to have a fresh install to follow
00:11 - along or if you just like to give Linux
00:13 - a try then this will be a good starting
00:15 - point so first we'll need to download
00:17 - and install VirtualBox so this is pretty
00:19 - straightforward so I'm not gonna go into
00:21 - too much detail here but if you just do
00:24 - a quick search on google for a
00:25 - VirtualBox and it should take you to the
00:27 - downloads page and that's here at
00:29 - virtualbox.org now from here you can
00:32 - choose your operating system and walk
00:33 - through the installation so for example
00:36 - I'm on a Mac so I would choose the OS X
00:38 - installation here so I already have
00:40 - VirtualBox installed so I'm not going to
00:42 - walk through that but it's just a very
00:44 - simple step-by-step process that you
00:46 - click through just like installing any
00:48 - other software so after you get that
00:50 - installed then if you open it up then it
00:52 - should look like this here so now that
00:54 - we have VirtualBox installed we're gonna
00:56 - need to download the ubuntu linux iso
00:59 - file so this will allow us to install
01:02 - the operating system so do a quick
01:04 - google search for a boon tube and it
01:06 - should take you to their home page that
01:08 - looks something like this so once you go
01:11 - here then you can go to the downloads
01:13 - page and the boon to desktop should be
01:16 - the first option here so if we go ahead
01:18 - and choose the desktop now you can see
01:20 - here it has a couple of recommended
01:22 - system requirements and we can just go
01:24 - over here and click download now this is
01:26 - free open-source software but it will
01:28 - take you to a donation page so you can
01:32 - donate if you'd like to but if you just
01:34 - like to download the ISO file then you
01:36 - can go to not now and take me to the
01:39 - download now your download here should
01:41 - start automatically now you can see that
01:43 - this is a pretty large file so here this
01:46 - is nearly one and a half gigs so I'm
01:48 - gonna go ahead and fast forward this
01:49 - video to when it's finished downloading
01:51 - ok so once we have that downloaded now
01:54 - let's go ahead and minimize Chrome here
01:56 - and pull up VirtualBox so now we're
01:58 - ready to create a new virtual machine so
02:01 - let's go ahead and choose new now for
02:03 - the name here let's just go ahead and
02:05 - call this a boon to Linux and for the
02:08 - type it's just going to be Linux
02:12 - it's Auto selected Ubuntu 64-bit for the
02:15 - version so let's go ahead and keep that
02:17 - and continue now we're not going to go
02:19 - into too much detail with some of these
02:21 - setup options basically we're just
02:23 - saying how much memory and disk space we
02:25 - want allocated to our virtual machine
02:27 - and this depends on your computer but
02:29 - you're usually safe staying within the
02:31 - green sections here so from my memory
02:34 - I'm going to go ahead and choose 4096
02:37 - megabytes which is 4 gigabytes and for
02:42 - the hard disk here I'm gonna leave that
02:44 - default and I'm gonna leave the
02:46 - VirtualBox disk image as the default
02:48 - there I'm going to leave that as
02:50 - dynamically allocated now for the hard
02:54 - disk size I'm actually going to bump
02:56 - this up to 25 Giga bytes here because
02:59 - that's what a boon to recommends on
03:01 - their downloads page now you can
03:04 - probably get by with allocating less but
03:06 - I'm going to go ahead and do the 25 so
03:10 - now we have that machine created but
03:12 - there's one more setting that I'm going
03:13 - to change before we install Ubuntu so if
03:16 - we select our machine and go to settings
03:18 - then we can see that we can change some
03:21 - of the values that we just set but there
03:24 - are also a lot of other customizations
03:25 - that we can make within here so one
03:28 - change I'm going to make is I'm going to
03:29 - go to the display tab and the video
03:32 - memory I'm going to go ahead and bump
03:34 - this up to the max and that's just going
03:37 - to improve our performance when we start
03:39 - the virtual machine so I'm going to go
03:42 - ahead and save that okay so now we're
03:44 - ready to install it boom - so we install
03:47 - this using the ISO file that we
03:49 - downloaded earlier so to do this we can
03:51 - select our ISO by going down here to
03:54 - storage and clicking on this empty
03:57 - optical drive and then go to choose disk
04:00 - image and then we just navigate to where
04:03 - we downloaded that ISO file and select
04:06 - that ISO file and click open so now you
04:09 - can see that it has that ISO file
04:10 - attached so now we can just go ahead and
04:12 - start this virtual machine to install
04:15 - boon to
04:23 - okay so the actual installation here is
04:25 - a pretty straightforward process but
04:27 - we'll go ahead and walk through this
04:28 - really quickly so now we can just go
04:31 - here to install Ubuntu now this is
04:35 - optional here I usually choose to
04:37 - download the updates while it's
04:38 - installing so I don't don't have to do
04:40 - it later but for the sake of time here
04:43 - I'm just going to go ahead and leave
04:44 - this unchecked but it's up to you
04:45 - whether you want to download those
04:47 - updates now so now since this is a fresh
04:49 - installation we can just leave this
04:51 - erase disk and install and go to Install
04:54 - Now and then here we can just choose
04:55 - continue and then here you can just go
04:57 - ahead and choose your timezone and then
04:59 - continue and I'll just keep walking
05:02 - through here and now it'll bring up to
05:05 - where we can type in our name and choose
05:08 - a name for our computer if we would like
05:10 - and also a password and you need to
05:13 - remember this password because it's
05:15 - going to be what you use to log in
05:17 - whenever we restart the machine so let's
05:20 - go ahead and continue there and now this
05:22 - will install the operating system so I'm
05:24 - gonna go ahead and let this install and
05:26 - fast-forward until that's complete okay
05:29 - so once that installation is complete
05:30 - then I'll come up here and ask you to
05:32 - restart so let's go ahead and do that
05:35 - now at this point you may run into this
05:38 - problem where it freezes and it gives
05:39 - you this warning and I have to be honest
05:41 - I didn't really understand this warning
05:43 - until I did a little research online but
05:46 - basically it's a harmless warning and we
05:48 - can just manually exit out of here to
05:51 - power down the machine so if we were to
05:55 - start that machine back up then it
05:57 - should just be good to go but if you do
05:59 - want to suppress that warning then I did
06:02 - see a few people say that you could come
06:04 - in here to settings and then you can go
06:06 - to system and acceleration and you can
06:10 - turn off this enabled nested paging but
06:13 - it's never really been an issue for me
06:15 - so I'm going to go ahead and leave that
06:17 - checked and just start back up my
06:20 - machine here okay so once we start our
06:23 - machine back up then everything should
06:25 - be installed and we should see a login
06:28 - screen here so now we can just sign in
06:30 - with the password that we specified
06:32 - during the installation
06:34 - okay so now
06:35 - having a boom to desktop ready to go but
06:37 - we're not quite done yet one thing
06:39 - you're gonna want to do is install guest
06:41 - additions software so guest additions
06:44 - software will fix the display settings
06:46 - that so that you can use the Linux in
06:48 - full screen and it'll also allow you to
06:50 - share directories between your host
06:52 - computer and the VM and it'll also allow
06:55 - you to share your clipboard which means
06:57 - you'll be able to copy and paste back
06:58 - and forth between your host computer and
07:00 - your VM so for example right now this is
07:04 - full screen and you can see that it
07:06 - doesn't take up much of the screen and
07:08 - that we have a lot of wasted space here
07:10 - on the sides and guest additions will
07:12 - fix this now there's a couple of
07:14 - different ways that you can do this but
07:16 - one of the simplest ways is just to come
07:18 - up here to devices and then you can
07:21 - choose insert guest additions CD image
07:24 - so this will pop up here and ask us if
07:26 - we want to run the software and we go
07:28 - ahead and do that and then we will have
07:31 - to put in our password and once that's
07:35 - done it will ask us to go ahead and
07:38 - restart so to restart we can just up
07:41 - here in the top right we can choose
07:43 - shutdown and when we choose shutdown we
07:46 - can go to restart ok so once that's done
07:51 - you can see that now we're in
07:53 - full-screen and that the VM uses all the
07:55 - space that it didn't before so now we
07:57 - can just go ahead and log back in here
07:59 - ok so now you should be good to go so
08:02 - you have a working fresh installation of
08:04 - Ubuntu and if you ever want to follow
08:06 - along with any of my command line
08:07 - tutorials then you can just come up here
08:10 - and search for the terminal and run that
08:14 - and you can just come in here and start
08:17 - playing around with any of these
08:19 - commands ok so I think that's going to
08:21 - do it for this video for people who are
08:23 - new to using VirtualBox one of the first
08:26 - things that they usually want to know is
08:27 - how to do simple things like getting
08:29 - guest additions software installed if it
08:31 - isn't already and we've already done
08:33 - that on this machine they also would
08:35 - like to know how to copy and paste back
08:37 - and forth between the host and virtual
08:39 - machine and also how to share folders
08:41 - between the host and virtual machine and
08:44 - I'm putting together a quick video
08:45 - covering how to do all of that if it's
08:48 - something that you want to
08:49 - learn and I'll put a link to that video
08:51 - in the description section below once I
08:53 - get it released if you do have any
08:55 - questions and feel free to ask in the
08:57 - comment section below and I'll do my
08:58 - best to answer those if you enjoy these
09:00 - tutorials and would like to support them
09:02 - then there are several ways you can do
09:03 - that the easiest way is to simply like
09:06 - the video and give it a thumbs up also
09:08 - it's a huge help to share these videos
09:09 - with others who you think would find
09:11 - them useful and if you have the means
09:13 - you can contribute to the channel
09:14 - through patreon and there's a link to
09:16 - that page in the description section

Cleaned transcript:

hey there how's it going everybody in this video we're going to be learning how to install Ubuntu Linux on VirtualBox so I plan on doing more Linux tutorials in the near future so if you'd like to have a fresh install to follow along or if you just like to give Linux a try then this will be a good starting point so first we'll need to download and install VirtualBox so this is pretty
