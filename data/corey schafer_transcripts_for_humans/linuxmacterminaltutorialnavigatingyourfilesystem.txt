00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video we will begin learning how to run
00:04 - commands from within the terminal and
00:06 - we'll start by learning how to navigate
00:08 - the file system so learning to navigate
00:11 - the file system is a great way to get
00:14 - your feet wet in the command line
00:15 - because there aren't any commands that
00:17 - we're going to run in this tutorial that
00:20 - have any side effects on your system so
00:22 - while navigating through your terminal
00:24 - you can run these commands and get
00:26 - comfortable without worrying about
00:27 - accidentally deleting important folders
00:30 - or files or changing something that you
00:33 - shouldn't be changing also in this
00:35 - walkthrough I will have this Finder
00:37 - window open here on the right side of
00:39 - the screen so that you can see exactly
00:41 - where we are as if we were navigating
00:44 - through finder so this will help us
00:47 - better visualize where we are and what's
00:49 - going on as we navigate through the
00:51 - terminal so to do this we basically only
00:54 - need three commands PWD LS and CD and
00:59 - also need to understand relative paths
01:01 - so let's go ahead and open up the
01:03 - terminal and see how we use these so the
01:05 - first command we'll run is PWD which
01:08 - stands for print working directory so
01:11 - this will print where we currently are
01:13 - on the filesystem and currently we're in
01:15 - our home directory so on a Mac this is a
01:18 - user's folder followed by your username
01:21 - if you're on a Linux machine this will
01:23 - be a directory called home followed by
01:25 - your username so we're on a Mac so you
01:27 - can see here that we are currently in
01:29 - this users directory followed by our
01:32 - user name so if I look over here in the
01:34 - Finder window that we're in the same
01:36 - place we're in this quarry shaver home
01:39 - directory and if we look at the bottom
01:40 - here you can see that we are in this
01:42 - users directory within this username
01:45 - folder so now let's say I want to view
01:48 - the files and folders within this
01:49 - directory just like we can see over here
01:51 - in the finder window and to do that we
01:53 - use the LS command now if we compare
01:56 - everything that just popped up with the
01:58 - LS command you can see that it matches
02:00 - what we see over here in our Finder
02:04 - window so now let's say that we want to
02:06 - navigate to this navigation demo folder
02:09 - here so within finder we can just double
02:12 - click on this
02:13 - and it takes us when that within that
02:15 - folder but over here in the terminal
02:17 - we're going to do this
02:18 - by doing a CD command and CD stands for
02:22 - change directory so if I do a CD and
02:25 - navigation demo and hit enter then it
02:29 - will take us within that folder now if I
02:31 - do a PWD which is print working
02:33 - directory which we use before within
02:35 - here then we can see that we're now in
02:37 - this user's gauri and then navigation
02:41 - demo so now just same as before if I do
02:44 - an LS command then it will list all of
02:46 - these same files and folders that we can
02:49 - see over here in the Finder window now
02:51 - one thing that doesn't show up from
02:53 - within our Finder window is hidden files
02:56 - so there are hidden files in this
02:58 - directory that we can't currently see
03:00 - now to view these files from within the
03:02 - terminal it's as easy as adding a tag a
03:06 - after the LS command so if I do an LS
03:09 - space and then - a then hit enter it's
03:13 - going to show me all the files including
03:15 - those that are hidden so you can see
03:18 - here not only do we have the directories
03:21 - and the txt files that we can see over
03:23 - here within finder but we can also see
03:25 - these hidden files which you can tell
03:28 - our hidden files because they begin with
03:30 - a dot so now what if we want to see more
03:33 - information about our files and our
03:35 - folders we can add the - L command onto
03:39 - the end of our LS command and this will
03:41 - list the long form which displays the
03:46 - permissions the user and group owners of
03:50 - the files and folders some sizes and
03:53 - also some date information now we can
03:55 - combine those options and do the long
03:58 - form of the hidden files by doing a - la
04:01 - so we're using the L and the a Auctions
04:04 - and this will list the long forms of the
04:06 - files which does all the extra
04:08 - information plus you can see here but up
04:10 - at the top that we have our hidden files
04:12 - listed as well so I mentioned before
04:14 - that we should also understand relative
04:17 - paths what I mean by that is that we
04:20 - should understand what dot and what dot
04:23 - dot are in relation to where we
04:26 - currently
04:26 - or so one dot is the current directory
04:29 - and two dots is our parent directory so
04:33 - what do I mean by parent directory if I
04:34 - do a PWD here to print the working
04:36 - directory it'll make a little bit more
04:38 - sense so here we are within this
04:41 - navigation demo directory and our parent
04:44 - directory would be one above this so
04:47 - this quarry Schaeffer directory is the
04:50 - navigation demo parent directory parent
04:52 - directory for this folder is the users
04:56 - directory now you can kind of see the
04:58 - same set up over here within finder down
05:00 - here at the bottom so users Corey
05:02 - Schaeffer and then in the navigation
05:04 - demo now let's navigate to this sub
05:07 - Durer one right here so we just
05:09 - navigated there from within finder and
05:11 - to do this within terminal we're going
05:13 - to navigate to sub der one change
05:16 - directory there let's do a PWD just to
05:18 - make sure we got that right and you can
05:20 - see now we're in this sub dyrone so now
05:23 - let's say I wanted to navigate back to
05:24 - this navigation demo folder now I can't
05:28 - do a CD and then navigation demo because
05:32 - there's not a navigation demo from
05:35 - within this directory what we do to do
05:37 - that is to use our parent directory so
05:40 - we're going to navigate using CD dot dot
05:43 - and that's going to take us up one
05:45 - directory to our parent directory so if
05:47 - I type that in then type in PWD then you
05:51 - can see that we just navigated up to our
05:53 - parent directory now we can also put in
05:55 - folders we can also put in multiple
05:58 - folders at once so if I do an LS on this
06:02 - sub directory one this will show us the
06:07 - files and folder folders from within sub
06:10 - directory one even though we aren't
06:12 - currently in that directory so we can
06:14 - see here that there is a folder within
06:17 - sub door one called sub dirt two now
06:21 - even though that is down to directories
06:23 - we can navigate there by typing in
06:25 - subtor one and then followed by sub dirt
06:29 - too so we're doing it all in one command
06:32 - now if I do a PWD you can see that we
06:35 - navigate it down into both of these
06:37 - directories in one command
06:39 - now this works with the relative paths
06:41 - as well so if I want to get back to this
06:43 - navigation demo folder then I can do a
06:45 - CD dot dot to go back to our sub turn
06:49 - and then I can do another dot dot to go
06:53 - back to navigation demo so if I hit
06:56 - enter with that CD command into a PWD
06:59 - then you can see that now we're back in
07:01 - our navigation demos folder that would
07:04 - be the same if I'm over here in finder
07:05 - that would be the same as navigating up
07:07 - to my sub dyrone and then I could go to
07:11 - navigation demo and now I'm back in the
07:13 - navigation demo folder now lastly let's
07:16 - say that we want to go back to our home
07:18 - directory now there's two ways we can do
07:20 - this we can just type in CD and hit
07:22 - enter and it will assume that we want to
07:24 - go to our home directory or we can do a
07:26 - CD with this tilde here and if we do
07:29 - that and I'm going to a PWD you can see
07:31 - that now we're back in our home
07:33 - directory now we can also use that tilde
07:35 - as a starting point so if I did a CD and
07:37 - then the tilde then I can navigate
07:40 - anywhere within my home directory so
07:42 - from here I can type in navigation demo
07:44 - and if I do a PWD here then we navigated
07:48 - into that navigation demo folder using
07:51 - that tilde so that about does it for
07:53 - this video play with these three
07:55 - commands and learn how to navigate your
07:57 - system and once you're more comfortable
07:59 - with navigating through your file system
08:02 - and the relative paths then we can start
08:04 - using more advanced commands which will
08:06 - actually alter your file system and
08:08 - create files and create directories and
08:10 - and so on so I know this was a pretty
08:13 - basic tutorial but if you're new to
08:14 - navigating through the terminal then I
08:16 - hope that you found it useful if you do
08:18 - have any questions just ask in the
08:20 - comment section below

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody how's it going in this video we will begin learning how to run commands from within the terminal and we'll start by learning how to navigate the file system so learning to navigate the file system is a great way to get your feet wet in the command line because there aren't any commands that we're going to run in this tutorial that have any side effects on your system so while navigating through your terminal you can run these commands and get comfortable without worrying about accidentally deleting important folders or files or changing something that you shouldn't be changing also in this walkthrough I will have this Finder window open here on the right side of the screen so that you can see exactly where we are as if we were navigating through finder so this will help us better visualize where we are and what's going on as we navigate through the terminal so to do this we basically only need three commands PWD LS and CD and also need to understand relative paths so let's go ahead and open up the terminal and see how we use these so the first command we'll run is PWD which stands for print working directory so this will print where we currently are on the filesystem and currently we're in our home directory so on a Mac this is a user's folder followed by your username if you're on a Linux machine this will be a directory called home followed by your username so we're on a Mac so you can see here that we are currently in this users directory followed by our user name so if I look over here in the Finder window that we're in the same place we're in this quarry shaver home directory and if we look at the bottom here you can see that we are in this users directory within this username folder so now let's say I want to view the files and folders within this directory just like we can see over here in the finder window and to do that we use the LS command now if we compare everything that just popped up with the LS command you can see that it matches what we see over here in our Finder window so now let's say that we want to navigate to this navigation demo folder here so within finder we can just double click on this and it takes us when that within that folder but over here in the terminal we're going to do this by doing a CD command and CD stands for change directory so if I do a CD and navigation demo and hit enter then it will take us within that folder now if I do a PWD which is print working directory which we use before within here then we can see that we're now in this user's gauri and then navigation demo so now just same as before if I do an LS command then it will list all of these same files and folders that we can see over here in the Finder window now one thing that doesn't show up from within our Finder window is hidden files so there are hidden files in this directory that we can't currently see now to view these files from within the terminal it's as easy as adding a tag a after the LS command so if I do an LS space and then a then hit enter it's going to show me all the files including those that are hidden so you can see here not only do we have the directories and the txt files that we can see over here within finder but we can also see these hidden files which you can tell our hidden files because they begin with a dot so now what if we want to see more information about our files and our folders we can add the L command onto the end of our LS command and this will list the long form which displays the permissions the user and group owners of the files and folders some sizes and also some date information now we can combine those options and do the long form of the hidden files by doing a la so we're using the L and the a Auctions and this will list the long forms of the files which does all the extra information plus you can see here but up at the top that we have our hidden files listed as well so I mentioned before that we should also understand relative paths what I mean by that is that we should understand what dot and what dot dot are in relation to where we currently or so one dot is the current directory and two dots is our parent directory so what do I mean by parent directory if I do a PWD here to print the working directory it'll make a little bit more sense so here we are within this navigation demo directory and our parent directory would be one above this so this quarry Schaeffer directory is the navigation demo parent directory parent directory for this folder is the users directory now you can kind of see the same set up over here within finder down here at the bottom so users Corey Schaeffer and then in the navigation demo now let's navigate to this sub Durer one right here so we just navigated there from within finder and to do this within terminal we're going to navigate to sub der one change directory there let's do a PWD just to make sure we got that right and you can see now we're in this sub dyrone so now let's say I wanted to navigate back to this navigation demo folder now I can't do a CD and then navigation demo because there's not a navigation demo from within this directory what we do to do that is to use our parent directory so we're going to navigate using CD dot dot and that's going to take us up one directory to our parent directory so if I type that in then type in PWD then you can see that we just navigated up to our parent directory now we can also put in folders we can also put in multiple folders at once so if I do an LS on this sub directory one this will show us the files and folder folders from within sub directory one even though we aren't currently in that directory so we can see here that there is a folder within sub door one called sub dirt two now even though that is down to directories we can navigate there by typing in subtor one and then followed by sub dirt too so we're doing it all in one command now if I do a PWD you can see that we navigate it down into both of these directories in one command now this works with the relative paths as well so if I want to get back to this navigation demo folder then I can do a CD dot dot to go back to our sub turn and then I can do another dot dot to go back to navigation demo so if I hit enter with that CD command into a PWD then you can see that now we're back in our navigation demos folder that would be the same if I'm over here in finder that would be the same as navigating up to my sub dyrone and then I could go to navigation demo and now I'm back in the navigation demo folder now lastly let's say that we want to go back to our home directory now there's two ways we can do this we can just type in CD and hit enter and it will assume that we want to go to our home directory or we can do a CD with this tilde here and if we do that and I'm going to a PWD you can see that now we're back in our home directory now we can also use that tilde as a starting point so if I did a CD and then the tilde then I can navigate anywhere within my home directory so from here I can type in navigation demo and if I do a PWD here then we navigated into that navigation demo folder using that tilde so that about does it for this video play with these three commands and learn how to navigate your system and once you're more comfortable with navigating through your file system and the relative paths then we can start using more advanced commands which will actually alter your file system and create files and create directories and and so on so I know this was a pretty basic tutorial but if you're new to navigating through the terminal then I hope that you found it useful if you do have any questions just ask in the comment section below be sure to subscribe for some more advanced terminal tutorials and thank
