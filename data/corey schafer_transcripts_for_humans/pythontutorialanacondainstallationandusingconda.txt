00:00 - Hey there. How's [it] going everybody in this video?
00:02 - We'll be learning how to get started with Anaconda by continuum
00:05 - analytics now if you don't know what Anaconda is it is a data science platform that comes with a lot of stuff right out of
00:10 - The box so it comes with a python
00:12 - Distribution a package manager called conda a way to manage environments and a lot of other
00:17 - Libraries and packages pre-installed now these packages are usually related to data science
00:21 - So it comes with things like numpy [Sci] [Pi] [jupiter] Notebooks
00:25 - and things like that now the number one question [people] usually have when they first hear about something like
00:29 - Anaconda is why would you need it?
00:31 - So what benefit you get from Anaconda as opposed to just installing these packages through pip or something like that
00:37 - Well, you shouldn't feel obligated to use Anaconda. It's really just an option that some people prefer
00:42 - So if you're getting along, just fine with regular python and haven't run into any problems then there's really no huge reason to switch
00:48 - But a lot of people especially those in the data science community who might not be full-time developers they find that
00:55 - Anaconda simplifies a lot of common problems that beginners run into and it's also good to use in classrooms
01:01 - So that you know your students are all on the same page, [so] things like installing python on multiple platforms
01:08 - separating out different environments
01:10 - Dealing with not having correct privileges and getting up and running with specific packages and libraries all of those are things that
01:16 - Anaconda can help with so let's go ahead and download Anaconda here, and we'll walk through some of the features
01:21 - So I'm here on the anaconda download Page and if you just Google python
01:27 - Anaconda then this should be one of the first results, [and] you can also [Google] the company name which is continuum analytics
01:33 - So at the top of the download page here
01:35 - We can see that there [is] a link for the list of packages that comes pre-installed with Anaconda
01:41 - So I'm going to go [ahead] and open this up and I'm going to pull up python
01:45 - 3.5 now if we scroll down here then you can see that it comes with a lot of stuff right out of the box
01:51 - So all those packages can take up a lot of space now
01:54 - If hard drive space is an issue for you
01:56 - And you don't want to download all those packages
01:57 - Then they do offer a download here called mini conda and mini Conda is a small bootstrap version that comes with their python
02:06 - Distribution essential packages and conda and we'll talk about Conda in just a second
02:10 - but we're going to go ahead and download the entire thing so that's going to include all of the packages that it comes pre-installed with
02:18 - So the download is pretty straightforward, so I'm going to download this for my mac
02:22 - But if you're on a windows or a linux machine, and you can just choose one of those for your operating system
02:27 - So I'm just going to choose os x here and then I'm going to download this graphical installer
02:33 - So I'm going to go ahead and cancel out of this here, and then I'll just wait for this download to finish
02:39 - [ok] so once that is downloaded. Let's go ahead and open that [up] and run through the installer now
02:44 - We're pretty much [just] going to be clicking through and accepting defaults here
02:49 - So I'm going to go ahead and agree [to] these and I'm going to stall only for me
02:53 - And I'm going to leave the default location and so now I'm just going to fast forward until this is finished installing
03:00 - Ok so now that that download is finished
03:02 - [I'm] just going to go ahead and close down my browser here and pull up my terminal okay?
03:06 - So when we install it anaconda, [it] should have automatically added that to our path
03:10 - So to test this we can just go ahead and type in python now
03:16 - If everything installed correctly and we should have a python version 3 here and you can see that
03:21 - It's using this anaconda distribution, and if you install the full version of Anaconda
03:25 - [then] we should be able to import certain packages that were included with that download so I should just be able to type in import
03:32 - numpy and run that and you can see that that didn't give us an error so that package does exist and just
03:37 - To test that further let's go ahead and also import matplotlib and see if that works so you can see that that worked also
03:44 - So we already have a couple of packages here ok so now let's just go ahead and exit out [of] python here
03:50 - And now I'm just going to go ahead and clear my screen. So that's all there is to installing
03:54 - Anaconda and depending on what kind of system
03:56 - You're on a lot of people find that kind of installation of python much easier than doing it manually
04:01 - Especially whenever you get a lot of popular packages out of the box now if you do need to add more packages
04:06 - We still have pip which most of you are probably familiar with and if you'd like to learn more about pip
04:10 - then I do have a separate video on that, but if I go ahead and type in pip list
04:16 - Then you can see that it lists out all [of] the packages that came pre-installed
04:20 - with Anaconda
04:22 - Now Anaconda also comes with its own package manager called conda
04:26 - And conda is useful because we can [use] it to install non python packages and dependencies
04:32 - So it can install some things that wouldn't necessarily make sense
04:35 - with pip so we can view all the commands that we can use with Conda by running Conda - - [he'll]
04:43 - Now you can see that a lot of these conda commands are similar to our pip commands, so in here
04:49 - We have list and search and install and things like that
04:53 - so let's go ahead and clear the screen here and
04:56 - let's run conda list now if we compare this to our pip list then we notice that all of these with the
05:04 - Py tags here are python packages that were also listed in our pip list
05:09 - so if you ever need to install [additional] packages
05:11 - Then you can try running
05:12 - Conda install and if for some reason you have any issues [with] using Conda or just prefer pip then you can still use pip install?
05:20 - to install packages now one thing that's really interesting and useful about conda is that you can use it to manage your
05:26 - environments - so some of you may have seen my video on virtually envy where you can make isolated virtual environments for different projects and
05:33 - Conda can do that as well, and it even has a few advantages over birthday and B
05:38 - So let's take a look at how we can create some virtual environments now
05:42 - I'm not going to go into too much depth about why we should be using virtual environments
05:45 - I covered that in some previous videos
05:47 - But basically what they're used for is when we want to work on multiple projects these projects may use different
05:53 - versions of different packages and possibly even different versions of python
05:57 - So instead of trying to get all of our projects to conform to [our] global installations and versions
06:02 - We can instead just create these separate environments that have the specific packages and versions that we need
06:08 - So [let's] say that we wanted to start working on a flask app now to create a new environment for this
06:14 - Application using conda then we can just say conda create and then I'm going to do a - - name here
06:20 - I'm just going to call this my app
06:22 - And now I'm going to go ahead and pass in some
06:25 - Starting packages that we want so I'm going to say flask and sql alchemy
06:29 - Now you have to have at least one starting package when you create a new environment with Conda
06:34 - But if you don't want one then you can just pass in something like pip or python
06:38 - But it is required to have a but in this case
06:41 - We're going to be building a flask application anyway
06:43 - So let's just go ahead and pass flask and sql alchemy in as those packages
06:47 - And then it's going to show you what it's going to install and let's just go ahead and [hit] yes
06:53 - Okay, so now we want to activate that new environment that we just created now
06:57 - This is going to be different on a Mac than on windows on windows. I believe you can just say something [like]
07:03 - activate my app, but on Mac
07:06 - This [is] actually going to be source activate my app
07:10 - So if I run that you can tell that we're in our new environment here because it added the name of our environment above our
07:17 - Prompt right here
07:18 - and if I clear my screen
07:19 - You can see that that still stays there and once we have that environment
07:22 - Activated if we do a pip list then you can see that we only have our base flask and sql alchemy
07:29 - Packages and on Mac or linux if we want to see the path to which python we're using then we can run which
07:35 - Python and you can see that the python that we're using is now within this my app environment, okay?
07:41 - And once you're done with your environment and want to deactivate it on windows. You can just say
07:47 - Deactivate but on Mac or linux that's actually going to be source deactivate
07:52 - So we can also use content to create environments using different versions of python also?
07:57 - so let's say that I wanted to create an environment for the same flask at but using python [2] 7 instead of python 3 5
08:04 - Now I'm just going to bring back up that command that we used to create [that] environment, but instead
08:09 - I'm just going to change this name to my app 2 7 and I'm also going to pass in this keyword here
08:15 - [python] equals two point seven now this python doesn't have
08:20 - Dashes before so it's not an option. It's just python [two] seven there
08:24 - So now I'm going to go ahead and run that and it's going to tell us what packages
08:28 - It's going to install so I'm going to go ahead and hit yes on that and once that environment is done installing
08:34 - Now I'm just going to go ahead and activate it. So I'm going to say
08:37 - Source activate my app [two] seven and now that we have [that] activated let's go ahead and Run python
08:45 - Within here, and you'll see that the version of python that we have here is python 2.7
08:50 - So specifying that version when we created our environment work for luckly, okay?
08:54 - So now let's just go ahead and exit out [of] python and let's go ahead and also
08:59 - deactivate our
09:01 - Virtual environment there now one useful thing that we can do with conda is that we can view our environments that we've created
09:06 - so if I say conda
09:08 - ENv list and list those out then you can see that both of the environments [that] we created are there and
09:15 - currently this default when this root one is the one that's
09:18 - activated and if you ever want to remove [an] environment
09:21 - Then we can just say conda remove and then we'll pass in the name of our environment
09:26 - So I'll grab this my app here and paste that in and now we need to
09:30 - Specify all of the packages and if we just want to delete the [entire] thing then we can just say all
09:35 - it's going to ask us if we want to continue, and we can just hit yes and
09:39 - Now if I relist those environments, then you can see that the my app is gone
09:44 - So I'm going to go ahead and do that same thing for my
09:48 - 2.7 also say yes, and
09:50 - Clear the screen and if I list those out then you can see we [just] have our root and a content environment
09:56 - Okay, so I think that's going to do it for this video
09:58 - I hope this gave you an idea of why some people would prefer using Anaconda for their python development now
10:03 - It's not for everyone, but if you are someone who is working in Data science?
10:06 - Then it really does come with some nice packages out of the box, and you're probably going to see it recommended on certain sites
10:12 - So I wanted you all to know what it was and why certain sites might suggest it so for example
10:17 - Jupiter notebooks are becoming very popular right now if you go to their website they recommend installing
10:23 - Anaconda because after the installation of Anaconda, you can just say jupiter notebook and fire one of those up
10:32 - And you can see that that just pops up ready to go so speaking of Jupiter Notebooks
10:36 - I plan on doing a tutorial on these very soon
10:39 - So installing Anaconda might be a good starting point if you want to follow along with those videos
10:43 - But it's also real easy to install through pip
10:45 - So if you don't want to install Anaconda, then you'll still be able to follow along just fine
10:49 - So if anyone has any questions about what we cover in this video
10:52 - Then [feel] free to ask in the [comment] section below and I'll do my best to answer those
10:55 - If you [enjoy] these tutorials and would like to support them then there are several ways you can do that
10:59 - These just ways to simply like the video and give it a thumbs up and also
11:02 - it's a huge help to share these videos with anyone who you think would find them useful and if you
11:06 - The means you can contribute through patreon
11:08 - And there's a link to that page in a description section below be sure [to] subscribe for future videos and thank you all for [watching]
