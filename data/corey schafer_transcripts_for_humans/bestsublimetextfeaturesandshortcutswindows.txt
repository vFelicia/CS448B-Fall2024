00:00 - hey there how's it goin everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be going over
00:02 - my favorite features and shortcuts in
00:04 - sublime text so sublime text is the
00:06 - editor that I use in most of my videos
00:08 - and I get tons of questions about how
00:10 - I'm doing certain things or what
00:11 - features I'm using so we'll cover my
00:13 - favorites here now learning how to use
00:15 - the features and shortcuts of the editor
00:17 - that you're using can definitely help
00:19 - you be more productive and get things
00:21 - done more quickly now this video will be
00:23 - for sublime text on the Windows
00:25 - operating system now if you're on a Mac
00:27 - then I do have a video for that as well
00:29 - so I'll put a link to that in the
00:30 - description section below I was gonna
00:32 - try to do this as one single video but
00:34 - the shortcuts are so different for each
00:36 - operating system that it was best just
00:37 - to split those into separate videos okay
00:40 - so the features that we're going to go
00:41 - over in this video will be features that
00:43 - will be available on the default
00:44 - installation of sublime text so you
00:46 - won't need any of the packages that I
00:48 - have installed with my installation but
00:51 - if you are curious about what packages
00:52 - and setup I'm using then I do have a
00:54 - separate video on that as well so I'll
00:56 - also put a link to that in the
00:58 - description section below also so with
01:00 - that said let's go ahead and get started
01:01 - so first of all the feature that I use
01:04 - the most and the one that I get asked
01:05 - about the most is the multi cursor
01:07 - functionality so I use this in a lot of
01:10 - my videos to speed up certain things but
01:12 - I use it all the time and my daily
01:13 - coding as well so this is also what will
01:16 - spend the most time one because there
01:18 - are a lot of different ways to use this
01:20 - so for people who don't know what this
01:22 - is it's a way to have multiple cursors
01:24 - at once now at first that might not
01:26 - sound useful but let's look at some
01:28 - examples and see why this is so awesome
01:30 - so I have a blank HTML file open here so
01:33 - let's say that we wanted to write some
01:34 - sample HTML code to put into a project
01:36 - so for example we're just going to
01:38 - create an unordered list with ten
01:40 - different items so I'm gonna create an
01:42 - unread list by hitting ul and then
01:44 - hitting tab and now we want ten list
01:46 - items and let's say that within those
01:48 - list items we wanted each one to be an
01:50 - h1 tag so we could just create one list
01:53 - item and then copy and paste that 10
01:55 - times or we can use multiple cursors to
01:58 - just type them all at once so to do this
02:01 - I'm gonna hit enter and make 10 blank
02:03 - lines here so we already have one line
02:05 - so I'll make nine more 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 ok
02:09 - so now we have 10 blank lines and now
02:11 - I'll create a new cursor on each
02:13 - by clicking on the first line here and
02:16 - I'm just going to make sure that that's
02:18 - untapped and now I'm going to hold down
02:20 - control and just click on each spot that
02:23 - I want another cursor so I'm holding
02:25 - down control and just clicking on these
02:28 - other lines and you can see that it's
02:29 - creating multiple cursors here and once
02:31 - we have those cursors in place that we
02:33 - could just start typing and it will type
02:35 - that content in all of those cursor
02:37 - locations so if I type out a list item
02:39 - so li and then hit tab creates the list
02:42 - item and now I can create an h1 tag by
02:45 - hitting h1 and pressing tab and that
02:47 - completes that and now I can just fill
02:49 - this in with some dummy text so I'll
02:50 - just put tests there okay so now you can
02:52 - see that we have ten list items fully
02:54 - complete so we can see that it just
02:56 - typed out multiple lines for us at once
02:59 - so using that ctrl-click is one way to
03:02 - get multiple cursors now another use
03:04 - case for this would be if we wanted to
03:06 - edit something in multiple places so for
03:08 - example let's say that we wanted to
03:10 - change all of the h1 tags in this list
03:12 - to be h2 tags now you might be thinking
03:15 - that you can just do a standard fine and
03:17 - replace all and in this example you
03:19 - could but a shortcut for this if I just
03:21 - select the first h1 here if I have my
03:25 - cursor here within the first h1 and then
03:27 - hand hit alt f3 then you can see that
03:31 - that highlights all of our h1 tags for
03:33 - editing so now we can just simply change
03:35 - those to h2 and save that so that
03:38 - changes all of the instances of the h1
03:41 - tags but in a larger document you might
03:43 - have some other h1 tags outside of this
03:45 - list that you don't want to change
03:47 - so simply highlighting and changing all
03:49 - of them might not be exactly what you
03:51 - want so let's change these back to h1 so
03:55 - I'm just going to undo that change so
03:57 - now let's look at an example we're going
03:58 - to want to be a little more selective so
04:01 - let's say that we just want to change
04:02 - certain h1 tags so let's change the last
04:05 - 5 h1 tags to be h2 tags now one way that
04:09 - we could do this would be by clicking
04:11 - where we want to start so that would be
04:13 - right here and then just holding down
04:15 - ctrl and double clicking all of these
04:18 - instances that we want to change but
04:20 - going through and clicking like that
04:21 - might take a while and there's actually
04:23 - a shortcut that we can use that will
04:24 - highlight the next match
04:26 - for us so if I just click the first one
04:28 - here now our cursor is within that h1
04:31 - tag and now let's just hit control D and
04:34 - then keep hitting ctrl D and it'll
04:37 - highlight the next h1 so whatever you
04:40 - have highlighted hitting control D will
04:42 - highlight that next match for you so
04:44 - that you can make multiple changes at
04:45 - once
04:46 - so now we went all the way to the bottom
04:48 - here if I was to hit control D again
04:50 - then it would cycle back up to the top
04:52 - but we don't want to do that so now I'm
04:54 - just going to change those last five to
04:57 - h2 tags so we can see that we can use
04:59 - those multiple cursors to only change
05:01 - those where we want okay now another
05:03 - awesome thing that we can do with
05:05 - multiple cursors is to copy and paste
05:07 - multiple things at once so what do I
05:09 - mean by that well for example I have a
05:11 - snippets file open here and let me open
05:14 - this up it's got a few different lines
05:15 - and we can see that we have ten items
05:17 - here on different lists so let's say
05:19 - that we want these items to be the text
05:21 - that is inside of our HTML list items so
05:24 - how could we do this well some people
05:26 - might just copy and paste one item at a
05:29 - time back and forth but that would take
05:31 - a really long time especially if our
05:32 - list was a lot larger so instead let's
05:35 - just highlight all of these at once and
05:38 - then copy those and paste them so I'm
05:40 - going to do a ctrl click at the end of
05:43 - each of these lines which we saw before
05:44 - will create a cursor at the end of each
05:47 - of these lines so I'm just going through
05:48 - and control clicking down on each of
05:51 - these items and now I'm going to
05:52 - highlight all of this by holding in
05:54 - control shift and then hitting my left
05:57 - arrow and I'm just going to do that
05:59 - multiple times until I get back to the
06:01 - beginning of the line and now once we
06:04 - have everything highlighted let's copy
06:06 - this by hitting ctrl C and now going
06:09 - back to our HTML and now back in our
06:11 - list let's highlight the 10 locations
06:13 - that we want to change and I'll do that
06:15 - just by clicking on the first test here
06:18 - and then pressing ctrl D like we did
06:21 - before and just highlight all of these
06:23 - so I will just highlight down all the
06:25 - way to the bottom and now that we have
06:26 - all 10 of these highlighted then we can
06:29 - simply paste in what we copied by
06:30 - pressing control V so you can see that
06:33 - it pastes in all of that information
06:35 - into those 10 locations so that pays our
06:38 - 10 copied items into
06:40 - ten different locations now when you
06:42 - copy and paste multiple multiple items
06:44 - like this you have to have the same
06:46 - number of cursors that you used to copy
06:48 - in order to paste so if you don't then
06:52 - it will paste in all of those items and
06:54 - that can be pretty ugly so what I mean
06:56 - by that let me just show you what I mean
06:58 - so I'll come down here to the bottom and
07:00 - create a few blank lines here now I'm
07:02 - going to just create two cursors now
07:04 - remember we have 10 items copied but
07:07 - only two cursors here so now if I paste
07:10 - this in then it's just going to paste
07:12 - all 10 of those items on those two
07:15 - cursors so be on the lookout for that
07:18 - maybe that's what you want but maybe
07:20 - it's not so if you have 10 cursors then
07:23 - it's just gonna paste all 10 of those
07:25 - items one time just like it did up here
07:27 - in our list so now I will remove that
07:30 - and go back to our list here so this
07:32 - multi cursor copy and paste trick has
07:35 - saved me a ton of time more times than I
07:36 - can count so it's pretty awesome now
07:39 - another thing that I use this for is to
07:41 - split things out and make them more
07:43 - readable so for example let me go back
07:45 - to my snippets file here if I scroll
07:47 - down here to the bottom so this is a
07:49 - real example of what my path environment
07:51 - variable looks like on my Mac and Linux
07:53 - machines now if you don't know what this
07:55 - is then don't worry about it it's just
07:57 - basically a list of directories on your
07:59 - machine where your terminal looks for
08:01 - commands now all of these directories
08:03 - are separated by colons so that's not
08:06 - really readable right now especially if
08:08 - you have a lot more directories how to
08:10 - do it than this so let's say that I
08:11 - wanted to split these up onto different
08:13 - lines so that I could read this a little
08:15 - better so to do this I can just simply
08:17 - highlight the first colon here and now
08:20 - I'm just going to press control D until
08:22 - I highlight all the way up until the
08:24 - last colon and now I'm just going to
08:26 - simply hit enter and we can see that it
08:28 - replaced all of those colons with a new
08:30 - line and split all of these directories
08:32 - up onto their own lines then and that
08:34 - makes it a lot more readable ok so now
08:37 - that we saw a few examples of using this
08:39 - in HTML let's look at a quick example of
08:42 - how you might use this and Python so
08:44 - we'll just do a quick overview of a few
08:46 - tricks that we just learned so I have a
08:48 - Python script opened up here so let me
08:50 - switch to that so this script here is
08:53 - from my abs
08:54 - Oriented video where we started learning
08:55 - about classes and manually setting
08:58 - attributes now this is actually a
09:00 - mistake that I made in that video so if
09:02 - you look here then I created my employee
09:05 - one object and an employee two object
09:07 - and then I'm manually setting attributes
09:10 - on both of those here now for the second
09:13 - group of attributes here I accidentally
09:15 - set them on employee one again so all of
09:17 - these actually should be employee two
09:20 - here so we could go through and manually
09:22 - fix those or we can simply use multi
09:24 - cursors to just click on employee one
09:27 - here at the top then press control D
09:30 - until we highlight the four that we want
09:32 - to change now remember we don't want to
09:33 - change all of the employee ones just the
09:35 - ones in the second group so that's why
09:37 - control D is so useful once we have all
09:39 - those highlighted then we can just go to
09:41 - the end here delete that one make that a
09:44 - to save it and we're done okay and now
09:46 - let's say that our boss comes in and
09:48 - tells us that this EMP one variable name
09:51 - isn't descriptive enough so we need to
09:53 - change that to something more
09:55 - descriptive so we want to change EMP one
09:58 - and EMP to to be employee one and
10:01 - employee two and in this case since we
10:03 - want to change them all then we can
10:05 - simply highlight one of these here so
10:08 - I'll just highlight the top one and then
10:10 - I will press alt and then f3 to
10:14 - highlight all of those EMP variable
10:17 - names and to change all of them all at
10:19 - once I will just go to where we want to
10:21 - make the addition and type that in and
10:24 - you can see it's typing at all of those
10:25 - cursor locations and changing them all
10:27 - and then we can save that so now we can
10:29 - see that all of those were changed okay
10:31 - so that is a look at the multi cursor
10:33 - functionality in sublime text
10:35 - now that is by far my favorite feature
10:37 - in sublime now this is also becoming
10:39 - more popular and other editors as well
10:41 - so if you're not using sublime text then
10:43 - check if the editor that you are using
10:45 - has multi cursor functionality and start
10:48 - using it if you can because it'll save
10:49 - you a ton of time okay so now let's look
10:52 - at some more features and shortcuts that
10:54 - I use a lot within sublime so one
10:56 - feature that I use all the time is
10:58 - switching between tabs and creating
11:00 - multiple panes so first of all we can
11:03 - see that we already have multiple tabs
11:04 - open here with multiple files open so
11:07 - to switch through these with a keyboard
11:09 - shortcut we can use ctrl tab and ctrl
11:12 - tab will move to the next tab and ctrl
11:15 - shift tab will move to the previous tab
11:18 - now if we want to close a tab then we
11:22 - can hit ctrl W and we can see that that
11:25 - club that that tab that we're on closed
11:27 - down now if we accidentally closed the
11:29 - tab and we want to reopen a closed tab
11:31 - then we can hit control shift T and it
11:36 - will reopen the tab that we closed now
11:38 - if any of you are Google Chrome users
11:39 - then that should be familiar to you
11:41 - because it's the same keyboard shortcuts
11:43 - for Chrome tabs also and I'm glad that
11:45 - sublime uses those familiar shortcuts ok
11:48 - so now that we've looked at tabs now
11:50 - let's look at how to set up multiple
11:52 - panels now this is something that I also
11:54 - use a lot especially when I'm doing
11:56 - something like web development where I
11:58 - want to be able to see the HTML and CSS
12:00 - at the same time or maybe you know maybe
12:03 - look at a Django or flask view and a
12:06 - template at the same time or anything
12:08 - like that so there are a lot of
12:10 - different panel layouts that we can use
12:11 - so if we hit alt shift and 2 then we can
12:15 - see that it creates and opens two panels
12:18 - side by side and a column layout and we
12:20 - can drag any tab that we want into this
12:23 - panel so that we can see both of these
12:25 - at once so now I can see the HTML file
12:29 - here along with the snippets file here
12:31 - now if we hit alt shift and 3 then it'll
12:35 - open up 3 panels in a column layout and
12:38 - then we can look at three files at once
12:40 - now with the word wrap here and the text
12:42 - so large it's getting all scrunched
12:44 - together but usually I have two text a
12:46 - lot smaller than this so this three
12:48 - column layout is extremely useful if
12:49 - you're working on something like
12:50 - front-end code and you want to see your
12:52 - HTML Javascript and CSS all at the same
12:56 - time ok now we can also hit alt shift
12:59 - and 4 and that will open up four columns
13:02 - now I feel like this starts to get a
13:04 - little crowded and a little less
13:05 - practical unless you have a really big
13:07 - monitor but some people find it useful
13:09 - now we can also hit alt shift and five
13:12 - and it will split our four panels into a
13:16 - grid so instead of that four column
13:18 - layout now we have two columns and two
13:21 - rose now I feel like this would be a
13:23 - little more practical on a large monitor
13:26 - but still I don't really use the four
13:27 - panels very often I use the two panels a
13:30 - lot and the three panels a little bit
13:32 - also now we can also hit alt shift eight
13:36 - and that'll just open up two rows if you
13:38 - prefer them stacked one on top of
13:41 - another rather than side by side and to
13:43 - get back to our single window then we
13:45 - can simply just hit alt shift and one
13:47 - and it'll take us back to that single
13:48 - window okay so another nice quick
13:51 - shortcut that I like in sublime text is
13:53 - being able to move lines around using
13:55 - ctrl shift and then the up and down
13:58 - arrows so let me show you this by going
14:00 - back to our sample HTML here so let's
14:03 - say that we wanted to move a few of
14:04 - these items around so instead of copying
14:07 - and pasting them all around we can
14:09 - simply click on the line that we want to
14:11 - move and then hold in ctrl shift and
14:14 - then use the up and down arrows to move
14:17 - this around where we want so we can see
14:19 - I'm moving it up to the top of the list
14:21 - now and if I hit the down there it moves
14:23 - it to the bottom so if we wanted to
14:25 - reverse this whole list then I could
14:27 - simply click on the first item and hold
14:29 - ctrl shift use the arrows to move it
14:32 - down and then just do this for every
14:34 - item in the list and pretty soon we will
14:38 - have the whole thing reversed and then
14:43 - switch the five and six and that
14:44 - reversed our list so that would have
14:46 - taken a lot longer if we were to copy
14:48 - and paste everything okay so the rest of
14:50 - these features that we're going to look
14:51 - at are just going to be real quick
14:53 - keyboard shortcuts so first of all in my
14:56 - videos I'll often run a Python code
14:58 - using sublime text so sublime has some
15:01 - built in build systems where it will try
15:03 - to run the code of whatever language
15:05 - you're using so let me open up my
15:07 - sandbox Python file here and I will
15:11 - close that and we can see that we have a
15:14 - print statement here at the bottom of
15:15 - the file so the keyboard shortcut for
15:17 - running code in sublime text is control
15:20 - B so if I press control B then we can
15:23 - see that it runs that code and prints
15:24 - out that first employees email now by
15:26 - default sublime will try to guess how
15:28 - you want to run certain code but if
15:30 - you're using different versions of
15:32 - Python or anything like that then I have
15:34 - a separate video
15:34 - on sublime build systems showing how you
15:37 - can set those up exactly how you want
15:39 - okay so another thing that I do a lot
15:41 - when I've opened a directory is to get
15:44 - some more screen space and collapse the
15:47 - sidebar so first of all let me close
15:49 - this bottom panel here where we ran our
15:51 - code and to do that we just press escape
15:53 - and now I want to collapse this sidebar
15:56 - to get more screen space so to collapse
15:58 - that I can just hold down ctrl and then
16:01 - press K and then B and you want to hold
16:04 - down control the whole time when you're
16:06 - pressing both of those buttons so again
16:07 - I'm gonna hold down control and open
16:09 - this sidebar again and then press K and
16:13 - then B while holding down control and it
16:15 - opens that back up so that's a nice
16:17 - quick keyboard shortcut to collapse that
16:20 - and pull it back up when you want it
16:21 - okay so something else that I use a lot
16:23 - is the keyboard shortcut for commenting
16:25 - code and to do that you can use control
16:27 - forward slash and this works for
16:29 - multiple languages as well so over here
16:32 - in my HTML if I want to comment out
16:35 - these last five items here then I can
16:37 - just highlight those then press control
16:39 - Ford slash and we can see that it
16:41 - comments out those last five items there
16:44 - and if I want to do this in Python then
16:47 - I can come in and click on a line and
16:49 - press control Ford slash and it will
16:51 - comment out one line or I can highlight
16:53 - multiple lines press control Ford slash
16:56 - and it comments out all of those lines
16:58 - at once so we can see that the syntax
17:00 - for comments and HTML and Python both
17:03 - have different ways of commenting their
17:05 - code and sublime adds those in correctly
17:08 - automatically for each language so
17:10 - that's really useful okay so lastly
17:12 - another one of my favorite features with
17:14 - sublime is the command palette now you
17:17 - can open the command palette by pressing
17:19 - ctrl shift P and that will open up the
17:23 - command palette now the command palette
17:25 - allows you to do a few different things
17:27 - like setting different syntaxes and
17:30 - things like that but the best thing that
17:32 - you can do is install new packages and
17:34 - packages allow you to add functionality
17:36 - that currently isn't in sublime so for
17:39 - example you may have noticed that my
17:40 - HTML has been Auto formatting throughout
17:44 - the video and that is an HTML package
17:47 - that
17:48 - or match your code for you and you can
17:49 - also install packages that make visual
17:51 - changes as well
17:52 - so it gives you different color schemes
17:54 - and different themes and things like
17:56 - that also now I've already done a video
17:58 - on the packages and other preferences
18:00 - that I have set in my sublime text so I
18:02 - won't go into details in this video but
18:05 - I will put a link to that video in the
18:06 - description section below if anyone is
18:08 - interested okay so I think that is gonna
18:10 - do it for this video
18:11 - hopefully you found this helpful and
18:13 - learn some new things about sublime text
18:14 - I get a lot of comments asking about
18:17 - these features so hopefully this cleared
18:19 - up any questions that anyone would have
18:21 - now if you have any favorite features or
18:23 - shortcuts that I didn't mention in this
18:24 - video then feel free to leave a comment
18:27 - and let me know about it so if you enjoy
18:29 - these tutorials and would like to
18:30 - support them then there are several ways
18:32 - you can do that the easiest ways to
18:33 - simply like the video and give it a
18:35 - thumbs up and also it's a huge help to
18:37 - share these videos with anyone who you
18:38 - think would find them useful and if you

Cleaned transcript:

hey there how's it goin everybody in this video we're going to be going over my favorite features and shortcuts in sublime text so sublime text is the editor that I use in most of my videos and I get tons of questions about how I'm doing certain things or what features I'm using so we'll cover my favorites here now learning how to use the features and shortcuts of the editor that you're using can definitely help you be more productive and get things done more quickly now this video will be for sublime text on the Windows operating system now if you're on a Mac then I do have a video for that as well so I'll put a link to that in the description section below I was gonna try to do this as one single video but the shortcuts are so different for each operating system that it was best just to split those into separate videos okay so the features that we're going to go over in this video will be features that will be available on the default installation of sublime text so you won't need any of the packages that I have installed with my installation but if you are curious about what packages and setup I'm using then I do have a separate video on that as well so I'll also put a link to that in the description section below also so with that said let's go ahead and get started so first of all the feature that I use the most and the one that I get asked about the most is the multi cursor functionality so I use this in a lot of my videos to speed up certain things but I use it all the time and my daily coding as well so this is also what will spend the most time one because there are a lot of different ways to use this so for people who don't know what this is it's a way to have multiple cursors at once now at first that might not sound useful but let's look at some examples and see why this is so awesome so I have a blank HTML file open here so let's say that we wanted to write some sample HTML code to put into a project so for example we're just going to create an unordered list with ten different items so I'm gonna create an unread list by hitting ul and then hitting tab and now we want ten list items and let's say that within those list items we wanted each one to be an h1 tag so we could just create one list item and then copy and paste that 10 times or we can use multiple cursors to just type them all at once so to do this I'm gonna hit enter and make 10 blank lines here so we already have one line so I'll make nine more 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 ok so now we have 10 blank lines and now I'll create a new cursor on each by clicking on the first line here and I'm just going to make sure that that's untapped and now I'm going to hold down control and just click on each spot that I want another cursor so I'm holding down control and just clicking on these other lines and you can see that it's creating multiple cursors here and once we have those cursors in place that we could just start typing and it will type that content in all of those cursor locations so if I type out a list item so li and then hit tab creates the list item and now I can create an h1 tag by hitting h1 and pressing tab and that completes that and now I can just fill this in with some dummy text so I'll just put tests there okay so now you can see that we have ten list items fully complete so we can see that it just typed out multiple lines for us at once so using that ctrlclick is one way to get multiple cursors now another use case for this would be if we wanted to edit something in multiple places so for example let's say that we wanted to change all of the h1 tags in this list to be h2 tags now you might be thinking that you can just do a standard fine and replace all and in this example you could but a shortcut for this if I just select the first h1 here if I have my cursor here within the first h1 and then hand hit alt f3 then you can see that that highlights all of our h1 tags for editing so now we can just simply change those to h2 and save that so that changes all of the instances of the h1 tags but in a larger document you might have some other h1 tags outside of this list that you don't want to change so simply highlighting and changing all of them might not be exactly what you want so let's change these back to h1 so I'm just going to undo that change so now let's look at an example we're going to want to be a little more selective so let's say that we just want to change certain h1 tags so let's change the last 5 h1 tags to be h2 tags now one way that we could do this would be by clicking where we want to start so that would be right here and then just holding down ctrl and double clicking all of these instances that we want to change but going through and clicking like that might take a while and there's actually a shortcut that we can use that will highlight the next match for us so if I just click the first one here now our cursor is within that h1 tag and now let's just hit control D and then keep hitting ctrl D and it'll highlight the next h1 so whatever you have highlighted hitting control D will highlight that next match for you so that you can make multiple changes at once so now we went all the way to the bottom here if I was to hit control D again then it would cycle back up to the top but we don't want to do that so now I'm just going to change those last five to h2 tags so we can see that we can use those multiple cursors to only change those where we want okay now another awesome thing that we can do with multiple cursors is to copy and paste multiple things at once so what do I mean by that well for example I have a snippets file open here and let me open this up it's got a few different lines and we can see that we have ten items here on different lists so let's say that we want these items to be the text that is inside of our HTML list items so how could we do this well some people might just copy and paste one item at a time back and forth but that would take a really long time especially if our list was a lot larger so instead let's just highlight all of these at once and then copy those and paste them so I'm going to do a ctrl click at the end of each of these lines which we saw before will create a cursor at the end of each of these lines so I'm just going through and control clicking down on each of these items and now I'm going to highlight all of this by holding in control shift and then hitting my left arrow and I'm just going to do that multiple times until I get back to the beginning of the line and now once we have everything highlighted let's copy this by hitting ctrl C and now going back to our HTML and now back in our list let's highlight the 10 locations that we want to change and I'll do that just by clicking on the first test here and then pressing ctrl D like we did before and just highlight all of these so I will just highlight down all the way to the bottom and now that we have all 10 of these highlighted then we can simply paste in what we copied by pressing control V so you can see that it pastes in all of that information into those 10 locations so that pays our 10 copied items into ten different locations now when you copy and paste multiple multiple items like this you have to have the same number of cursors that you used to copy in order to paste so if you don't then it will paste in all of those items and that can be pretty ugly so what I mean by that let me just show you what I mean so I'll come down here to the bottom and create a few blank lines here now I'm going to just create two cursors now remember we have 10 items copied but only two cursors here so now if I paste this in then it's just going to paste all 10 of those items on those two cursors so be on the lookout for that maybe that's what you want but maybe it's not so if you have 10 cursors then it's just gonna paste all 10 of those items one time just like it did up here in our list so now I will remove that and go back to our list here so this multi cursor copy and paste trick has saved me a ton of time more times than I can count so it's pretty awesome now another thing that I use this for is to split things out and make them more readable so for example let me go back to my snippets file here if I scroll down here to the bottom so this is a real example of what my path environment variable looks like on my Mac and Linux machines now if you don't know what this is then don't worry about it it's just basically a list of directories on your machine where your terminal looks for commands now all of these directories are separated by colons so that's not really readable right now especially if you have a lot more directories how to do it than this so let's say that I wanted to split these up onto different lines so that I could read this a little better so to do this I can just simply highlight the first colon here and now I'm just going to press control D until I highlight all the way up until the last colon and now I'm just going to simply hit enter and we can see that it replaced all of those colons with a new line and split all of these directories up onto their own lines then and that makes it a lot more readable ok so now that we saw a few examples of using this in HTML let's look at a quick example of how you might use this and Python so we'll just do a quick overview of a few tricks that we just learned so I have a Python script opened up here so let me switch to that so this script here is from my abs Oriented video where we started learning about classes and manually setting attributes now this is actually a mistake that I made in that video so if you look here then I created my employee one object and an employee two object and then I'm manually setting attributes on both of those here now for the second group of attributes here I accidentally set them on employee one again so all of these actually should be employee two here so we could go through and manually fix those or we can simply use multi cursors to just click on employee one here at the top then press control D until we highlight the four that we want to change now remember we don't want to change all of the employee ones just the ones in the second group so that's why control D is so useful once we have all those highlighted then we can just go to the end here delete that one make that a to save it and we're done okay and now let's say that our boss comes in and tells us that this EMP one variable name isn't descriptive enough so we need to change that to something more descriptive so we want to change EMP one and EMP to to be employee one and employee two and in this case since we want to change them all then we can simply highlight one of these here so I'll just highlight the top one and then I will press alt and then f3 to highlight all of those EMP variable names and to change all of them all at once I will just go to where we want to make the addition and type that in and you can see it's typing at all of those cursor locations and changing them all and then we can save that so now we can see that all of those were changed okay so that is a look at the multi cursor functionality in sublime text now that is by far my favorite feature in sublime now this is also becoming more popular and other editors as well so if you're not using sublime text then check if the editor that you are using has multi cursor functionality and start using it if you can because it'll save you a ton of time okay so now let's look at some more features and shortcuts that I use a lot within sublime so one feature that I use all the time is switching between tabs and creating multiple panes so first of all we can see that we already have multiple tabs open here with multiple files open so to switch through these with a keyboard shortcut we can use ctrl tab and ctrl tab will move to the next tab and ctrl shift tab will move to the previous tab now if we want to close a tab then we can hit ctrl W and we can see that that club that that tab that we're on closed down now if we accidentally closed the tab and we want to reopen a closed tab then we can hit control shift T and it will reopen the tab that we closed now if any of you are Google Chrome users then that should be familiar to you because it's the same keyboard shortcuts for Chrome tabs also and I'm glad that sublime uses those familiar shortcuts ok so now that we've looked at tabs now let's look at how to set up multiple panels now this is something that I also use a lot especially when I'm doing something like web development where I want to be able to see the HTML and CSS at the same time or maybe you know maybe look at a Django or flask view and a template at the same time or anything like that so there are a lot of different panel layouts that we can use so if we hit alt shift and 2 then we can see that it creates and opens two panels side by side and a column layout and we can drag any tab that we want into this panel so that we can see both of these at once so now I can see the HTML file here along with the snippets file here now if we hit alt shift and 3 then it'll open up 3 panels in a column layout and then we can look at three files at once now with the word wrap here and the text so large it's getting all scrunched together but usually I have two text a lot smaller than this so this three column layout is extremely useful if you're working on something like frontend code and you want to see your HTML Javascript and CSS all at the same time ok now we can also hit alt shift and 4 and that will open up four columns now I feel like this starts to get a little crowded and a little less practical unless you have a really big monitor but some people find it useful now we can also hit alt shift and five and it will split our four panels into a grid so instead of that four column layout now we have two columns and two rose now I feel like this would be a little more practical on a large monitor but still I don't really use the four panels very often I use the two panels a lot and the three panels a little bit also now we can also hit alt shift eight and that'll just open up two rows if you prefer them stacked one on top of another rather than side by side and to get back to our single window then we can simply just hit alt shift and one and it'll take us back to that single window okay so another nice quick shortcut that I like in sublime text is being able to move lines around using ctrl shift and then the up and down arrows so let me show you this by going back to our sample HTML here so let's say that we wanted to move a few of these items around so instead of copying and pasting them all around we can simply click on the line that we want to move and then hold in ctrl shift and then use the up and down arrows to move this around where we want so we can see I'm moving it up to the top of the list now and if I hit the down there it moves it to the bottom so if we wanted to reverse this whole list then I could simply click on the first item and hold ctrl shift use the arrows to move it down and then just do this for every item in the list and pretty soon we will have the whole thing reversed and then switch the five and six and that reversed our list so that would have taken a lot longer if we were to copy and paste everything okay so the rest of these features that we're going to look at are just going to be real quick keyboard shortcuts so first of all in my videos I'll often run a Python code using sublime text so sublime has some built in build systems where it will try to run the code of whatever language you're using so let me open up my sandbox Python file here and I will close that and we can see that we have a print statement here at the bottom of the file so the keyboard shortcut for running code in sublime text is control B so if I press control B then we can see that it runs that code and prints out that first employees email now by default sublime will try to guess how you want to run certain code but if you're using different versions of Python or anything like that then I have a separate video on sublime build systems showing how you can set those up exactly how you want okay so another thing that I do a lot when I've opened a directory is to get some more screen space and collapse the sidebar so first of all let me close this bottom panel here where we ran our code and to do that we just press escape and now I want to collapse this sidebar to get more screen space so to collapse that I can just hold down ctrl and then press K and then B and you want to hold down control the whole time when you're pressing both of those buttons so again I'm gonna hold down control and open this sidebar again and then press K and then B while holding down control and it opens that back up so that's a nice quick keyboard shortcut to collapse that and pull it back up when you want it okay so something else that I use a lot is the keyboard shortcut for commenting code and to do that you can use control forward slash and this works for multiple languages as well so over here in my HTML if I want to comment out these last five items here then I can just highlight those then press control Ford slash and we can see that it comments out those last five items there and if I want to do this in Python then I can come in and click on a line and press control Ford slash and it will comment out one line or I can highlight multiple lines press control Ford slash and it comments out all of those lines at once so we can see that the syntax for comments and HTML and Python both have different ways of commenting their code and sublime adds those in correctly automatically for each language so that's really useful okay so lastly another one of my favorite features with sublime is the command palette now you can open the command palette by pressing ctrl shift P and that will open up the command palette now the command palette allows you to do a few different things like setting different syntaxes and things like that but the best thing that you can do is install new packages and packages allow you to add functionality that currently isn't in sublime so for example you may have noticed that my HTML has been Auto formatting throughout the video and that is an HTML package that or match your code for you and you can also install packages that make visual changes as well so it gives you different color schemes and different themes and things like that also now I've already done a video on the packages and other preferences that I have set in my sublime text so I won't go into details in this video but I will put a link to that video in the description section below if anyone is interested okay so I think that is gonna do it for this video hopefully you found this helpful and learn some new things about sublime text I get a lot of comments asking about these features so hopefully this cleared up any questions that anyone would have now if you have any favorite features or shortcuts that I didn't mention in this video then feel free to leave a comment and let me know about it so if you enjoy these tutorials and would like to support them then there are several ways you can do that the easiest ways to simply like the video and give it a thumbs up and also it's a huge help to share these videos with anyone who you think would find them useful and if you have the means you can contribute through patreon and there's a link to that page and it's scripts in
