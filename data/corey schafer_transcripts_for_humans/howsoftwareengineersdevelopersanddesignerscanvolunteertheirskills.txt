00:00 - hey how's it going everybody uh this
00:02 - video is going to be a little different
00:03 - from the tutorial videos that I usually
00:05 - do um in this video I want to talk about
00:08 - volunteering and ways for software
00:11 - Engineers uh computer programmers web
00:14 - developers and web designers to give
00:16 - back to their Community there's a great
00:18 - line from the book Tuesdays with Mory
00:21 - when the main character was talking
00:22 - about giving back to your community and
00:24 - he talks about not just giving back with
00:26 - money but giving back with your skill
00:28 - set and uh here's the line from that
00:30 - book he says I don't mean money I mean
00:33 - your time it's not so hard there's a
00:35 - senior center that opened near here
00:37 - dozens of elderly people come there
00:39 - every day if you're a young man or a
00:41 - young woman and you have a skill you're
00:43 - asked to come and teach it say you know
00:45 - computers you come there and you teach
00:46 - computers you're very welcome there and
00:48 - they are very grateful this is how you
00:50 - start to get respect by offering
00:52 - something that you have now I couldn't
00:54 - agree with this more um you know it's a
00:56 - win-win situation too because when you
00:58 - share a skill that you have not not only
01:00 - are you helping other people but it also
01:02 - helps you hone your own skills so this
01:05 - got me thinking um what are some
01:07 - different ways in which software
01:09 - engineers and programmers and developers
01:11 - and designers um what are some ways that
01:13 - they can volunteer their skills and give
01:15 - back to the community and you know
01:17 - overall have a positive impact on the
01:19 - world well first of all you could uh
01:21 - take the advice directly from the book
01:24 - you could volunteer at a senior center
01:25 - or you could volunteer at an assisted
01:27 - living home uh I took this approach a
01:29 - few years ago I volunteered at an
01:31 - Assisting Living assisted living home
01:33 - for one night a week uh for two or three
01:36 - hours depending on the number of people
01:37 - who needed help um now I'm not
01:40 - mentioning this for a pat on the back or
01:41 - anything like that I'm only telling you
01:43 - this because there's this misconception
01:46 - out there that uh elderly people aren't
01:48 - interested in technology and uh from
01:50 - doing this I know firsthand that uh
01:53 - that's just not true um they want to be
01:55 - connected just as much as anybody else
01:57 - does and uh but sometimes they simply
02:00 - have the means or have the knowledge uh
02:02 - to get things up and running themselves
02:04 - and not only that but um perhaps maybe
02:08 - the staff or other volunteers there
02:10 - might not have that ability to help them
02:11 - out either um so you know on a typical
02:14 - night of this type of volunteering uh
02:17 - you might help someone do something as
02:19 - simple as uh setting up a free Google
02:22 - email account so that they can start
02:24 - emailing their family uh receiving
02:26 - pictures of their grandchildren and when
02:28 - they do start receiving the those family
02:30 - pictures and staying in closer contact
02:32 - with the family it really does make
02:33 - their day now the great thing about this
02:35 - type of volunteer work is that you don't
02:38 - have to be a software engineer or an
02:40 - expert programmer to help with these
02:42 - kind of issues um the things that you
02:44 - would do uh in a situation like that are
02:46 - very simple tasks so um you know there's
02:48 - young kids out there who can get in
02:50 - there and set up email accounts and do
02:52 - basic computer troubleshooting like uh
02:55 - you know uh connecting computers to the
02:57 - internet and things like that now if
03:00 - you're looking for uh something that
03:02 - involves a more in-depth skill set then
03:05 - maybe you want to look into making a
03:06 - website for a local business free of
03:08 - charge um so perhaps there's a local
03:11 - farmers market or a pet shelter um you
03:14 - know it's easy to get the impression
03:16 - that every business in in your city has
03:19 - a website already but there's a lot of
03:21 - businesses out there that don't
03:22 - especially the local businesses um also
03:25 - I see a lot of developers and designers
03:27 - online uh that are always asking for
03:29 - advice and trying to come up with
03:31 - different projects that they can use to
03:34 - build up their portfolio so if you're
03:36 - wanting to learn how to build a website
03:37 - or get into something like WordPress
03:39 - development uh maybe you can build up
03:41 - your portfolio and help someone out at
03:42 - the same time so if you have a favorite
03:45 - local business in town that doesn't have
03:47 - a website or has a bad website then this
03:50 - could be a great project to take on one
03:52 - thing that might be consider it though
03:54 - is that if you do decide to do this and
03:56 - it's one of your first websites that
03:58 - you've that one of your first websites
04:00 - that you've ever made uh you might want
04:02 - to be sure to let the people know that
04:03 - it that your website might not be top
04:05 - quality uh but most likely if these
04:08 - people don't have a website already or
04:09 - if they have a really bad website uh
04:11 - then they're going to enjoy whatever
04:12 - additional exposure that you can provide
04:14 - them anyways um even if that's just a
04:17 - quick and easy website that displays you
04:19 - know their business address business
04:21 - hours contact information um if it's a
04:24 - restaurant maybe their menu and things
04:26 - like that now something else that you
04:28 - might want to look into
04:30 - is becoming a tutor um there's always
04:34 - opportunities to tutor people at just
04:36 - about any age that you're comfortable
04:38 - with and you know as engineers and
04:40 - programmers most of you have a lot of
04:43 - training in math and problem solving and
04:46 - coding and among other things um so to
04:49 - check out what tutoring opportunities
04:51 - are available in your area I would just
04:54 - recommend getting online and doing a
04:55 - quick Google search um and if that
04:57 - doesn't turn anything up uh you can
05:00 - usually ask people at your local public
05:02 - library if they have anything like that
05:04 - available uh I don't know if that's the
05:06 - norm or not but personally every town
05:09 - that I've ever lived in has had tutoring
05:11 - opportunities through their public
05:13 - libraries uh so if that's something that
05:15 - interest you then I would definitely
05:16 - check that out and speaking of tutoring
05:19 - I would definitely check uh with the
05:22 - maybe the schools in your area and see
05:25 - if there's a youth first robotics
05:27 - program uh first stands for for
05:30 - inspiration and recognition of Science
05:33 - and Technology it's a terrific program
05:35 - it gets uh kids of all different ages
05:37 - involved in science and technology um if
05:40 - you check the first robotics volunteer
05:42 - website uh that I'm at now this is USF
05:45 - first.org
05:47 - community/ volunteers uh you can find
05:50 - pretty much any information that you
05:51 - would need um how to get involved what
05:54 - to expect uh as a volunteer volunteer
05:58 - training and how to become a a mentor
06:00 - and a coach also if you look down here
06:02 - at the bottom it says that they have
06:04 - close to 27,000 teams worldwide so most
06:08 - likely you're going to be able to find a
06:10 - program like this in your
06:12 - area now if you are a female then one
06:16 - organization that you might want to look
06:17 - into getting involved with is called
06:20 - girls who code um so software and
06:23 - programming and coding is an industry
06:26 - that unfortunately has been pretty
06:27 - male-dominated throughout the years and
06:30 - girl who code from what I hear is uh is
06:33 - a great organization that's getting more
06:35 - females interested in the field of
06:37 - computer science um if you go to their
06:39 - website here they have this tab that is
06:42 - get involved um so if you click on that
06:45 - then you can see that they have a
06:47 - volunteering section
06:49 - here and if you look down through um the
06:52 - volunteering opportunities here U
06:54 - they've got a few listed as well as
06:57 - becoming an instructor at a girls who
06:59 - club or a girls who code Club so that
07:03 - would be a great one to check out now
07:05 - everything that I've mentioned so far
07:07 - has involved personal interaction in
07:10 - order to volunteer uh but if tutoring or
07:13 - helping uh in person isn't something
07:15 - that you're comfortable with then
07:17 - perhaps you could you know you could
07:19 - always try answering people's questions
07:21 - online at websites like stack Overflow
07:24 - or Reddit or some other online forums
07:27 - now I'm sure this wouldn't be considered
07:28 - official public service and any court of
07:30 - law or anything like that uh but I
07:32 - personally consider it a form of
07:34 - volunteering for sure um you and this is
07:37 - also something that I've been wanting to
07:38 - do more of myself um and for any of
07:42 - those people who answer questions on
07:44 - these sites who might be watching this
07:45 - video I would just like to give a big
07:47 - thank you because you know at this point
07:50 - I definitely receive a much larger
07:52 - benefit from these uh sites than the
07:55 - amount that I contribute to them um you
07:58 - know some people put in a a ton of time
08:01 - uh answering questions on these sites um
08:03 - some of these detailed answers could be
08:06 - entire articles themselves and the
08:08 - people who answer those questions uh
08:09 - they don't get anything from the time
08:11 - that they put in other than a thank you
08:13 - and maybe some reputation points or
08:15 - something like that there is an added
08:17 - bonus uh to being active in these
08:19 - communities um you know it's something
08:22 - that you can uh point a potential future
08:25 - employer to uh you can point them to the
08:27 - answers that you've given on these
08:29 - websites and prove how well that you
08:31 - know your stuff and you know there's not
08:33 - absolutely nothing wrong with putting
08:34 - your volunteer efforts on a resume or
08:37 - anything like that now somewhat similar
08:39 - to answering questions online you can
08:42 - also start your own blog or your own
08:44 - YouTube channel and start writing and
08:46 - making videos about problems that you've
08:48 - run into and how you solve them uh you
08:51 - can share your knowledge that way now
08:53 - this is kind of cheating because if
08:55 - there was one thing on the list of
08:57 - things that I'm going to show you in
08:58 - this video that I don't don't
08:59 - necessarily consider volunteer work uh
09:02 - it would be your own blog or your own
09:04 - YouTube channel because you can always
09:06 - put ads on your blog articles and on
09:08 - your videos and if those become popular
09:10 - enough then uh you'll get a little bit
09:11 - of money kicked back your way for that
09:13 - but I would still recommend uh that
09:16 - people do this if they can and if they
09:18 - have the time to do it because not only
09:20 - will it help you learn more about the
09:22 - topics that you write about uh but you
09:24 - never know how many people will run into
09:26 - those exact same problems that you have
09:28 - and then Find Your solution online now
09:31 - another thing you that you can do is
09:33 - contribute to open- Source projects
09:36 - there's a lot of Open Source projects
09:38 - out there uh that help people in need um
09:41 - I would recommend checking out github's
09:43 - showcases uh page here and see if
09:46 - there's something there that interests
09:47 - you you can see here that they have this
09:50 - made in Africa section um if you click
09:52 - on here uh you'll most likely be able to
09:55 - find some great projects to work on and
09:57 - you're going to see a common theme some
09:59 - of these projects you have uh
10:00 - interactive messaging messaging engine
10:04 - SMS gateway um pretty much keeping
10:07 - people uh ways of connecting people it's
10:09 - extremely important to get people
10:10 - connected um so that's one option uh if
10:14 - we go back here to the showcases page if
10:16 - you scroll down you also see this uh
10:19 - government app section and within this
10:21 - government app section you're going to
10:23 - see projects for NASA um code for
10:26 - America which is a great organization
10:29 - um you also see National Park Service
10:32 - making making mapping libraries for the
10:34 - National Park Service um so uh lot of
10:38 - projects that you could contribute to
10:40 - here now something else that you might
10:42 - want to check out is the Milla volunteer
10:45 - page now I've personally never
10:47 - volunteered through this site so I have
10:49 - no firsthand experience with it um I
10:51 - just saw that it was recommended online
10:54 - as a way for um tech people to volunteer
10:58 - uh but if you look down here it's pretty
11:00 - much exactly what we've been talking
11:01 - about you can see here it says it's
11:04 - about learning collaborating and sharing
11:06 - your skills with a global Community um
11:09 - coders organizers activists and things
11:12 - like that and you can see that if you
11:14 - click here that they say that you can
11:16 - volunteer as much as you like or as
11:19 - little as you like it's totally up to
11:20 - you and if you click on get involved it
11:24 - takes you to a page where you can be
11:26 - matched up with your skill set and with
11:28 - your interest that are most suitable for
11:31 - you so I think that this looks pretty
11:33 - neat and maybe it's something that I'm
11:35 - going to give a try in the future and if
11:37 - it's something that looks interesting to
11:38 - you then you should definitely give it a
11:40 - shot now one of the last things I want
11:42 - to talk to you about is that if you want
11:44 - to be involved but you just don't have
11:47 - the time to do it then there are ways
11:50 - that pretty much require uh very little
11:53 - to zero effort um you know as software
11:56 - engineers and programmers uh a lot of us
11:59 - are are very fortunate to work for great
12:01 - companies that pay well and that
12:03 - sometimes allows us to earn more money
12:05 - uh than we need for our personal needs
12:07 - so if that includes you then I would try
12:09 - to find a charity that is involved with
12:11 - causes that are close to your heart and
12:14 - commit the donating portions of your
12:15 - salary to those Charities um on top of
12:18 - your donations a lot of tech companies
12:20 - like Google and apple and Microsoft will
12:23 - match donations made by their employees
12:26 - so if you're somebody who's uh currently
12:29 - already donating to Charities uh
12:31 - definitely check with your employer and
12:33 - see if they offer a match because uh you
12:36 - could potentially be doubling those
12:37 - donations and you should definitely take
12:40 - advantage of that if they offer that and
12:42 - there's one last thing that I wanted to
12:44 - talk about uh before wrapping this up
12:47 - and this goes for anyone not just people
12:50 - in the tech industry so it's great to
12:53 - get excited about volunteering and doing
12:55 - good things in the world but try not to
12:57 - overdo yourself um you're going to have
12:59 - the greatest impact when this becomes
13:01 - part of your routine and part of your
13:03 - daily life uh you don't want this just
13:05 - to be a one-time thing so if you
13:07 - overexert yourself or if you uh put in
13:10 - more time than what you have available
13:12 - or if what you're doing becomes more of
13:14 - a chore than something that fulfills you
13:16 - then you're less likely to keep it up
13:18 - and you're less likely to try it again
13:19 - in the future so I would just recommend
13:22 - starting slow finding your comfort zone
13:25 - and uh I can promise you that it's
13:27 - something that you'll enjoy once you get
13:28 - started
13:29 - so that about does it for this video um
13:31 - you know there's tons of ways to get
13:33 - involved out there if I missed anything
13:35 - which I'm sure that I did um then you
13:37 - know just put your suggestions for
13:39 - getting involved in the comment section
13:40 - below so I hope this video was useful
13:43 - for everybody and thank you all for
13:45 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey how's it going everybody uh this video is going to be a little different from the tutorial videos that I usually do um in this video I want to talk about volunteering and ways for software Engineers uh computer programmers web developers and web designers to give back to their Community there's a great line from the book Tuesdays with Mory when the main character was talking about giving back to your community and he talks about not just giving back with money but giving back with your skill set and uh here's the line from that book he says I don't mean money I mean your time it's not so hard there's a senior center that opened near here dozens of elderly people come there every day if you're a young man or a young woman and you have a skill you're asked to come and teach it say you know computers you come there and you teach computers you're very welcome there and they are very grateful this is how you start to get respect by offering something that you have now I couldn't agree with this more um you know it's a winwin situation too because when you share a skill that you have not not only are you helping other people but it also helps you hone your own skills so this got me thinking um what are some different ways in which software engineers and programmers and developers and designers um what are some ways that they can volunteer their skills and give back to the community and you know overall have a positive impact on the world well first of all you could uh take the advice directly from the book you could volunteer at a senior center or you could volunteer at an assisted living home uh I took this approach a few years ago I volunteered at an Assisting Living assisted living home for one night a week uh for two or three hours depending on the number of people who needed help um now I'm not mentioning this for a pat on the back or anything like that I'm only telling you this because there's this misconception out there that uh elderly people aren't interested in technology and uh from doing this I know firsthand that uh that's just not true um they want to be connected just as much as anybody else does and uh but sometimes they simply have the means or have the knowledge uh to get things up and running themselves and not only that but um perhaps maybe the staff or other volunteers there might not have that ability to help them out either um so you know on a typical night of this type of volunteering uh you might help someone do something as simple as uh setting up a free Google email account so that they can start emailing their family uh receiving pictures of their grandchildren and when they do start receiving the those family pictures and staying in closer contact with the family it really does make their day now the great thing about this type of volunteer work is that you don't have to be a software engineer or an expert programmer to help with these kind of issues um the things that you would do uh in a situation like that are very simple tasks so um you know there's young kids out there who can get in there and set up email accounts and do basic computer troubleshooting like uh you know uh connecting computers to the internet and things like that now if you're looking for uh something that involves a more indepth skill set then maybe you want to look into making a website for a local business free of charge um so perhaps there's a local farmers market or a pet shelter um you know it's easy to get the impression that every business in in your city has a website already but there's a lot of businesses out there that don't especially the local businesses um also I see a lot of developers and designers online uh that are always asking for advice and trying to come up with different projects that they can use to build up their portfolio so if you're wanting to learn how to build a website or get into something like WordPress development uh maybe you can build up your portfolio and help someone out at the same time so if you have a favorite local business in town that doesn't have a website or has a bad website then this could be a great project to take on one thing that might be consider it though is that if you do decide to do this and it's one of your first websites that you've that one of your first websites that you've ever made uh you might want to be sure to let the people know that it that your website might not be top quality uh but most likely if these people don't have a website already or if they have a really bad website uh then they're going to enjoy whatever additional exposure that you can provide them anyways um even if that's just a quick and easy website that displays you know their business address business hours contact information um if it's a restaurant maybe their menu and things like that now something else that you might want to look into is becoming a tutor um there's always opportunities to tutor people at just about any age that you're comfortable with and you know as engineers and programmers most of you have a lot of training in math and problem solving and coding and among other things um so to check out what tutoring opportunities are available in your area I would just recommend getting online and doing a quick Google search um and if that doesn't turn anything up uh you can usually ask people at your local public library if they have anything like that available uh I don't know if that's the norm or not but personally every town that I've ever lived in has had tutoring opportunities through their public libraries uh so if that's something that interest you then I would definitely check that out and speaking of tutoring I would definitely check uh with the maybe the schools in your area and see if there's a youth first robotics program uh first stands for for inspiration and recognition of Science and Technology it's a terrific program it gets uh kids of all different ages involved in science and technology um if you check the first robotics volunteer website uh that I'm at now this is USF first.org community/ volunteers uh you can find pretty much any information that you would need um how to get involved what to expect uh as a volunteer volunteer training and how to become a a mentor and a coach also if you look down here at the bottom it says that they have close to 27,000 teams worldwide so most likely you're going to be able to find a program like this in your area now if you are a female then one organization that you might want to look into getting

that then you can see that they have a volunteering section here and if you look down through um the volunteering opportunities here U they've got a few listed as well as becoming an instructor at a girls who club or a girls who code Club so that would be a great one to check out now everything that I've mentioned so far has involved personal interaction in order to volunteer uh but if tutoring or helping uh in person isn't something that you're comfortable with then perhaps you could you know you could always try answering people's questions online at websites like stack Overflow or Reddit

can and if they have the time to do it because not only will it help you learn more about the topics that you write about uh but you never know how many people will run into those exact same problems that you have and then Find Your solution online now another thing you that you can do is contribute to open Source projects there's a lot of Open Source projects out there uh that help people in need um I would recommend checking out github's showcases uh page here and see if there's something there that interests you you can see here that they have this made in Africa section um if you click on here uh you'll most likely be able to find some great projects to work on and you're going to see a common theme some of these projects you have uh interactive messaging messaging engine SMS gateway um pretty much keeping people uh ways of connecting people it's extremely important to get people connected um so that's one option uh if we go back here to the showcases page if you scroll down you also see this uh government app section and within this government app section you're going to see projects for NASA um code for America which is a great organization um you also see National Park Service making making mapping libraries for the National Park Service um so uh lot of projects that you could contribute to here now something else that you might want to check out is the Milla volunteer page now I've personally never volunteered through this site so I have no firsthand experience with it um I just saw that it was recommended online as a way for um tech people to volunteer uh but if you look down here it's pretty much exactly what we've been talking about you can see here it says it's about learning collaborating and sharing your skills with a global Community um coders organizers activists and things like that and you can see that if you click here that they say that you can volunteer as much as you like or as little as you like it's totally up to you and if you click on get involved it takes you to a page where you can be matched up with your skill set and with your interest that are most suitable for you so I think that this looks pretty neat and maybe it's something that I'm going to give a try in the future and if it's something that looks interesting to you then you should definitely give it a shot now one of the last things I want to talk to you about is that if you want to be involved but you just don't have the time to do it then there are ways that pretty much require uh very little to zero effort um you know as software engineers and programmers uh a lot of us are are very fortunate to work for great companies that pay well and that sometimes allows us to earn more money uh than we need for our personal needs so if that includes you then I would try to find a charity that is involved with causes that are close to your heart and commit the donating portions of your salary to those Charities um on top of your donations a lot of tech companies like Google and apple and Microsoft will match donations made by their employees so if you're somebody who's uh currently already donating to Charities uh definitely check with your employer and see if they offer a match because uh you could potentially be doubling those donations and you should definitely take advantage of that if they offer that and there's one last thing that I wanted to talk about uh before wrapping this up and this goes for anyone not just people in the tech industry so it's great to get excited about volunteering and doing good things in the world but try not to overdo yourself um you're going to have the greatest impact when this becomes part of your routine and part of your daily life uh you don't want this just to be a onetime thing so if you overexert yourself or if you uh put in more time than what you have available or if what you're doing becomes more of a chore than something that fulfills you then you're less likely to keep it up and you're less likely to try it again in the future so I would just recommend starting slow finding your comfort zone and uh I can promise you that it's something that you'll enjoy once you get started so that about does it for this video um you know there's tons of ways to get involved out there if I missed anything which I'm sure that I did um then you know just put your suggestions for getting involved in the comment section below so I hope this video was useful for everybody and thank you all for watching
