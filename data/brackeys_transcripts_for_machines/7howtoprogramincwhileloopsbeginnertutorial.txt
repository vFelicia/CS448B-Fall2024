thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to video number seven in the how to program and csharp course in today's video we're going to be taking a look at something quite similar to the for loop it's called the while loop and it's really quite useful for a bunch of things and some ways if you have any questions throughout this video head over to forum Rocky's comm where I among many others are ready to answer your questions cool so as always I've opened up xamarin studio and I'm just quickly going to walk you through my solution to the problem that I suggested you solved last time so the challenge from last times video was to loop through the numbers one to a hundred and print out all the even numbers and the way I've solved this solve this is using a basic for loop where I create a variable called I and set it equal to one I say that this uh this loop should run until I is less while I is less than or equal to 100 and we want to increment I every time we live through and then I just check if I is evenly divided by two so this percentage sign here is an operator that will check it for the remainder of a division so if I is equally divided by two it will result in zero and if it does I simply write out the number and separate them with a comma and a space so in order to see this in action let's go ahead and hit play and you can see that it prints out two four six eight ten and it goes all the way up to 100 cool so let's just delete this for now leave the console tricky and let's delve into the world of while loops so a while loop can perform many of the same operations that a for loop can such as counting numbers let's say we wanted to print out the numbers 1 3 and then we would create an integer we could just call this I stick to the same naming convention as before we could equal this to one then we could create a while loop code while and then we put in that condition say while I is less than or equal to ten and then just like the for loop and if statement we open up the brackets and in here by the way I just quickly want you it I want to and notice that you can also put the brackets down here if you find that easier to read many newer developers does I simply just like them up here but it's really something that programmers can argue about for hours and hours so inside of this while loop we can again simply say console dot write line and then put in the eye but this is where many many developers beginner developers go wrong with the while loops the thing okay I've created this I I've set a condition and I've written out let's go ahead and hit play no no no no no this is not where you go ahead and hit play because what we've created right here is what is called an infinite loop and infinite loops are ugly as hell they will often or almost definitely cause your program to crash because currently we don't increment I I will always remain one and therefore it will never go above ten and so we will keep out writing lines in to infinity and that's really not what we want so what we want to do instead is below the console dot write line we want to remember to increment I and by simply doing simply doing I plus plus we simply say that I should plus equals one however you want to write it so now when we play you can see that it prints out the numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine and then 10 and then it exits the loop and we are done with our main method cool but this is is what you can do with a while loop to emulate a for loop you can also do some other things let's say that we know a person called Tom and Tom knows his basic math and he likes to play with dices so he knows that if he has a dice with the numbers 1 through 6 and he throws this he has a 1 in 6 chance of getting of rolling a 6 but he wants to test this theory out in practice so what he does is he starting through stats throwing his dice and he notates you know a writes down every number that he gets so on the first hit he might get a 2 on the second he might get a 4 and then on the third try he might get a a 6 so he writes down 2 4 6 and then he writes out that took three tries but he wants to do this a bunch of time so he can test test out how many times this how many tries it actually takes him to do this so instead of throwing a dice each time he's asked us he's asked us to write a program for him and this is where wild loops are incredibly useful so let's try and write this out in code so first off we're going to need some variables we're going to need an integer and we're going to call this number of attempts and we're going to default this to zero because we start out by the haven't attempted anything let me run want to write out another integer and we are simply going to call this attempt this is going to store the single attempt and we're going to default that to zero also then what we want to do is we want to say while attempt is not equal to 6 we want to do something so while we haven't hit a six we want to first off set number of attempts or I'm sorry we want to first offset attempt to a random value so we haven't had it hit a six let's set it to a new random value let's roll again so in order to do this we say attempt equals and this is where we want to get some kind of number generator remember in one of the previous videos I showed you how to generate numbers at random so if you don't know how to do this so if you find the next part here a bit complicated please go ahead go back and watch it there so up here in the beginning of our method we're going to do random and we are going to call this number generator or maybe just number gen and we're going to equal this to a new random then down here we will say that attempt equals number Gen dot next and this will give us a random number between these two values and we're going to put in one because it's inclusive and then seven because that's exclusive so that will give us numbers between one and six and what we can then do is we can set the number of attempts to one more so we can simply increment the number of attempts and let's also write out what what he actually rolled on this particular attempt so let's write out console dot write line and we can maybe say Tom rolled a rolled and then it's simply going to write it out like this so we're going to plus attempt and then maybe a dot and remember the ending semicolon there and a ending parenthesis also whoops and a plus sign there cool so Tom rolled we inside the attempt and then simply finish it off with a dot and then we increment the number of attempts and then when we are done whoops when we exit out of this while loop it's because our attempt hit a six so down here we can write out console dot write line it took Tom and then we can inside number of attempts and then plus attempts so we are going to write out how many attempts it took tom to roll a sex so let's just say to roll a six now let's save this make sure you don't have an infinite loop that we are doing something with the attempt then we are here we're not simply incrementing it but we are getting a random number so let's try this out by hitting play and you can see that see that here he was actually quite unlucky it took him 16 attempts to roll a six first four then four then one five three blah blah blah until he wrote a six on his 16th attempt let's try this again so he took him 11 attempts to roll the six he took him only three attempts first a three then a three and then finally a sex and you can just keep on doing this as long as as you want to and it's now much easier to write down of these results than simply rolling a dice each time so let's say a good introduction I think to practical problem solving using while loops you can also do something else with while loops you can do what is called a dowhile loop it is used not as common though where you simply write like this too and then we put in I'm just going to delete this down here so you this Intex looks like this here so what you do is you first do some kind of action and then you check if a condition is met and if it is it loops back and does the action again we're with a an ordinary while loop it will check if the condition is met before it does the first iteration so a dowhile loop is basically you're basically sure that it would do at least one iteration so that's the simple difference there I don't think I need to demonstrate and that's really all you need to do so thanks for watching this video I think it was kind of short actually and I quite like the hand so thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video we're going to where I think we're going to be taking a look at methods which is really awesome so again thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
