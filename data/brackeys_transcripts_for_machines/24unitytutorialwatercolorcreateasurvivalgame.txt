hello everyone and welcome to the 24th video in our Survival game series done by Braes I am the CEO of Braes and in this video we're going to take a look at expanding on our time of day script to allow us to change the color of the water so it can fit in with the time of day so uh when it's night we're going to have like a dark water not that saturated and when it's bright uh or daytime we're going to have bright and uh colorful water so uh if we open up Unity you can see that a lot of things has changed here wow um I am currently working on a video where I do some time lapsing and then slow down uh certain parts of the video to show you what I've done here but basically I've just made a new terrain and uh don't worry every thing will be shown in the video it's going to be called uh Survival game level design uh 01 I think um so but I have sculpted and painted a new terrain uh I've added some water uh from the standard assets pack I've also made a path and I've included some of the uh different objects uh that we uh imported in the last tutorial so I've put some of them together and Chang them up a bit and I've also added some particles and some lights and some colliders here and there and so uh everything I've done here will again be explained in a future video so that's going to be really really awesome but for now let's just take a look at how it it looks so hit play and we can see it looks much better now we have much more detail we actually uh are starting to see a level uh shape uh type deal going on here uh so if we walk down to the water and and this is of course not the finished result uh the the level design video is probably going to be a whole series uh showing how I'm uh what I'm doing to expand on the level so if we walk down to the water uh right now it's it isn't looking too bad keep in mind that this is done with the free version of unity and so the water will never get to look really really awesome but uh we can make it look more awesome than this because if we change the slider to nighttime and look at the water it's almost like it's glowing and that's not really something we want and if we change it to like midday we can see that the water is then too dark so uh I just had to go uh with a property in between there so now let's actually modify our time of day script to allow us to change the color of the water so now let's go ahead and double click on our time of day script and so now let's go ahead and change this so um let me just bring my copy of this up on the other screen so I can see what we're doing okay so uh at the botton of the variable declaration here I want to create several new variables but first of I just want to type out some quick comments saying that this was added in tutorial number 24 it allows uh for changing the color that reflects of a water object and and just one more comment saying that uncheck include water if you are not interested in using this so basically what we're going to do now is we're going to create a variable that will store uh our water game object we are going to create a variable that will allow the user to decide or or rather you guys uh to decide whether not you want to actually use this feature so you can enable and disable it and uh then we're going to create two variables one that would will Define the W night color and one that will Define the W day so now let's go ahead and just do that so VAR v v uh game objects and so myON another one called uh include water it's going to be equal to false by default so you have to enable this feature as we will get a null reference if we haven't uh assigned anything to the game object and so it will just give us a bunch of Errors so uh the user or you guys have to decide whether not you want to use this before you assign stuff uh then we're going to have one called water KN which is going to be a type color and then a order day which is also going to be a type color so now save this out and now we should be able to go back into unity and see some variables appearing at the button here so we have the Warrior game object we have a checkbox if we want to include the water and we have then two color properties which you can just click and set or use the uh Color Picker here to choose anything from the scene so uh let's actually go ahead and set this up so let's drag in the start area water here so that's just the warrior object and of course you can make multiple of these variables and just assign it to all of them if you have if you have more than one uh uh water place or C or whatever uh so time of day and then drag in the start area water to the water variable hit the include water and uh now let's change the water night night to completely black and the water day to something like a bright blue I would say so something like that and again you can just go ahead and change uh change it to whatever you want uh that's completely up to you now let's go down to where uh actually let's go down to right under the sun. color equals color. lope and make some space and let's type uh let's actually com uh copy these comments down also so just so we're completely clear that people are understanding this and so if uh include water is equal to true then we want to do something here oops get a hold of the bracket keys there we go and what we want to happen is we want to take our water do renderer so the one that stores stuff like materials shaders and so on do material we want to access the material and we want to set a color for it so set color and then open up a parentheses and this is where we're going to access a Shader property and we have never talked about uh shaders and and scripting custom shaders and so on before but basically what a Shader property is is um it's a uh it's a variable for the Shader basically so it uh just like we can have um a checkbox and color stuff going on here we can have a property in a Shader called for example color or um blend amount reflectivity amount uh transparency and so on so uh we are simply going to type start parentheses and then underscore Horizon color comma and now we want want to set it so this is what it's called for the Shader that basic water uses and uh we can go ahead and find this inside of unit so we can go under our assets our day night no on our standard assets and this is where I have imported the uh water by press right clicking hitting import package and then water basic and if we import the water Pro we can see if this uses the same kind of Shader so if we just hit import on that and wait for it to import correctly should see it being done in a sec um so I really recommend that if this is not working for you you go ahead and check whether or not the property is called the same so if we go under the water basic select the day uh daylight symbol water we can see that it is using the water symbol shape and so under sources and under shaders we can see here the effects were symbol and there's a uh a category here called properties and the first one is indeed called Horizon color and we can see that it's a type color so if we go back uh we can see that the nighttime uh symbol water uses the same one and we can also see that if we go under our Pro and hit the daylight water it uses the effects water so if we go under sources here under shaders hit the effects water it is here called the let's see Horizon color there so that's also called Horizon color and uh we also have the water for and so on so you can go ahead and find it by doing this so go under do the different kinds of water here and changing that up so here I don't know if it's called Horizon but uh you can I'm sure you can find it on your own so let's delete out the water Pro go back to the water basic go under our time of day and now let's just uh finish the script up so Horizon color comma color. Lop parentheses water night comma water day comma slider 2 * 2 0.2 end up the parentheses and end with the semicolon so I won't go into too much detail here here but basically this line allows the color to lurp or fade between the water night and the water Day based on our slider values so now if we go in back into Unity hit the play button I can see we have an error so let's check that out vo base editor this is something to do with the word Pro which we en we import it so let's just go ahead and delete the editor version there too so go under the editor hit delete that so now that that's done we should be able to play the game indeed we are and if we walk down to the water and maybe change the speed variable of our time of day so go under our time of day and change this to something like 30 so we can see changing quickly you can see that the color of the water now fits the day much more nicely and everything Blends together it's not like it's shining and um and glowing so that's pretty much it for this video guys I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one yeah
