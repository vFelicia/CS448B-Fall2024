with the beginning of a new year and luckily that means there is a bunch of new indie games waiting to come out and of course as a fellow developer it's always great to see what others are working on in this video I want to share the indie games that I'm most excited about in 2018 so let's jump into first up we have Griff Lance this is one of those games that you take one look at and you immediately want to play made by the people behind don't starve the art style of gift lands is pretty similar it has an extremely put together look Griff dance is a turnbased RPG taking place in a bracket scifi world and with fighting animations like these I'm definitely excited about it next we have manifold garden manifold garden is a firstperson exploration game and it's actually made by a friend of mine William sure inspired by this real architecture of MC Escher manifold Gardens level design is a short force stretching as far as the eye can see and then some manifold garden just looks inherently interesting so yeah I'm looking forward to this one another beautiful game is the last night all the sprites are incredibly detailed and paired with the strange beauty of the dystopian backgrounds this game's atmosphere looks amazing the last night revolves around storytelling and making the players decisions count it's always interesting to see developers try and give their players real influence on the game also the cute 2d platformers bill donkey is finally getting a sequel the trailer doesn't give much away but if it's anything like the original it's definitely going to be worth playing now as some of you might know I'm a huge fan of Ori and the blind forest which is why I was absolutely stoked to find out that there's going to be a sequel orientable of the wisps has much to live up to since I consider the original the greatest platformer ever made judging by the trailer will if the wisps looks just as beautiful but of course when it comes to the gameplay we'll just have to wait and see this is definitely the game that I'm looking forward to the most this year also getting a sequel is the muchloved classic Super Meat Boy back when it came out Super Meat Boy pioneered a new era in indie titles and help show how popular indie games could become as for its sequel Super Meat Boy forever would be an adventure to translate market debate just like the original this game will be focused on fast paced gameplay and is probably going to be crazy hard but we all know which game is truly the most anticipated in the title of 2018 I'm of course talking about call of duty known among indie devs as the mother of indie games can can add another title to its range this year being a small studio I'm personally impressed that tragus able to publish a game so shortly after their last one all right on a more serious note I wanna mention Frost Punk made by the creators of this war of mine frost Punk gives you the power to rule over a population in a bleak frozen future you might even say that this game looks seriously cold frost Punk is definitely going to test your moral compass and your ability to prioritize so sign me up a game I'm personally really excited about it's octahedron a 2d platformer with an absolutely amazing color palette the soundtrack is also found to be awesome as its partially made by the artist behind the music for super hexagon which is an old favorite of mine and just like super hexagon I expect octahedron to rely heavily on its music this game is made by the oneman studio demimonde a and is to be released in January lastly I want to mention a fun game that's also created by a friend of mine nor nor isn't as much a game as it's a tool that enables you to do something very important play with your food I'm definitely looking forward to playing around with it so that pretty much sums up my most anticipated in the games of 2018 actually there's so many awesome indie titles coming this year that it was impossible to fit them all into this video so bear in mind that this is just my personal pics feel free to leave a comment stating the indie game that you just can't wait to play on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in December and a special thanks to German beefy OU infinity PBR euro Omer and soft tune sighs mummy Derrick Eames Kirk Murr face Tamara fine Peter die double tap 45 James Pete and Evans Thomas wooly Superman the great John Burkhart clock approaches Lotito Alex rickets key SUNYAC obscene James Rogers Robert Byrne Rob fan and Erasmus
