hello everyone here are my top 10 Unity quick tips they all tricks that I personally use and love do know that the list here is in no particular order all right so let's jump into it number one ending the editor while in play mode now most of you probably know just how annoying it is to make some changes to a game that you're really happy with only to realize that you were in play mode the entire time and so your progress was lost well that time has come to an end if you select edit preferences and then color you can adjust the play mode tint this makes the editor change color when you play the game so you almost can't help but notice number two snapping to the grid a lot of people don't know that you can snap objects to the grid if you hold down control while dragging on an object in fact you can also get a bunch of extra control by going edit snap settings here you can change the size of the Grid on the different axes and even quickly snap the selected objects into position number three locking the inspector if you need to select something but you don't want your inspector to change way from what you're currently viewing locking the inspector can be really handy this is especially useful when adding multiple objects to an array because it allows you to simply select them and add them all at once number four debug mode now it's good practice to Mark variables that are only accessed within the same class as private however this can be annoying when debugging because we can't visibly see the values of private variables in the inspector of course we can always insert some debug.log statements or change the variables to be public but much easier is just setting the inspector to debug mode and all of the sudden your private variables become visible number five align with view when you're setting up your camera for an as shot using the unity move move and rotate tools can feel really clumsy a much easier way is to find a good camera angle in the scene view then select your camera and press control shift F this will take the position and rotation of your scam View and paste it onto the camera transform you can also go to game object and click align with view number six range you can use the range attribute before a variable to give it a minimum and maximum value this will draw a slider in the unity inspector for easy tweaking number seven saving changes in play mode so if you're playing a game and adjusting some settings on a component you need to make sure that these changes aren't lost when you stop playing to do this you can right click the component select copy component then when you stop playing simply right click on the component once more and hit paste component values this one sure can be a lifesaver number eight spaces and headers if you're making a large script with a lot of public variables you can help organize them by inserting attributes space will create a gap between your variables and header allows you to write a title number nine hide an inspector staying on the subject of being organized you can always hide a variable by marking it with the hideen inspector attribute number 10 serialized field not all variables that you want to set in the inspector should be public in fact there's no reason to make a variable public unless it needs to be accessed from another class instead create a private variable and Mark it with civilized field this will make the variable show up in the inspector while still being private so that was pretty much it for this video if you liked it and want to see more definitely let me know also if you have any handy Unity tips make sure to share them in the comments down below and I might include them in a future video so thanks for watching and I will will'll see you in the next video thanks to all the awesome Patron supporters who donated in December and a special thanks to Sultan Al Sheriff Derek hrk facel marifi James Kell Hound Robert Barham and Jason latio if you want to become a patreon yourself you can do so at
