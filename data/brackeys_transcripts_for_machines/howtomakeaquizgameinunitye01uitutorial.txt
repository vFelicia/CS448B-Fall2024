thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to the first video in this short series on making a quiz game in unity using csharp so a lot of you guys have been requesting me to do some smaller series may be only a few videos long that cover how to make different kind of games and we are going to begin with a quiz game hopefully I will be able to teach basic objectoriented programming concepts we will also focus on how to store data and manipulate data in form if in the form of questions and then how to display that data in unity using unity Skua system so it's going to be a lot of fun if you are a beginner to intermediate user on this series is just for you and yeah so before we get started I just want to say that the multiplayer FPS tutorial and the 2d platformer course is still being worked on of course I have some really cool stuff coming out for that as well so this is just extra stuff don't freak out so let's just jump right into it so what we are going to be making in this video is the actual interface we are not going to be programming we are just going to be sketching some stuff out in unity and I have something really cool that we can use to do that so let's just make a new project here and I'm going to call mine simply quiz game and I'm going to save it on new projects and select 2d as default let's then hit create project and unity will open up a standard default project fast so that's going to be nothing in here what you could do now is simply right click here and go on the UI and start building the interface using these elements however I searched around a bit and I've actually found a really cool plugin that has some nice features or some nice elements that we can use for our interface and it's called material UI it's a unity plugin that has created the Google material design in unity so you can see all the cool looking elements right here that we are now able to use we are not going to be using all of the different features in this we're basically just going to be using some nice buttons with a cool click animation and some nice shadows and maybe a bit of the color palettes and stuff like that but you can really create some advanced stuff with this this package costs about $50 on the assets story so if you don't have that money and I definitely don't expect you to buy this you can either follow along and unity' using the normal stuff or do as I will do in this video and use the beta version before the official release release which is still publicly available on github so you're fine to use this this is licensed under the Apache License and you can definitely use this commercially so I'm going to have a link to this skip github page where you can download it in the description again should the link be broken or the stuff be taking down you can either sacrifice the money and get this really cool plugin or just use the default stuff in unity it's going to be just as fine there's nothing we are going to be using here that you can't do in unity so let's click material UI unity package for the latest release and you can see that it will be downloading down here as soon as it stops downloading we can simply click on this to open it up in unity that's the cool thing about unity packages they are completely wrapped finished packages that you can import into unity and it will take care of structuring everything together and all that so you can see we have this material UI folder which with a bunch of different assets inside and we're just going to import them all here so this might take a little while depending on your computer because this material UI plugin has a lot of elements in it I've used it for several product and projects now and I've been really fond of using it so especially especially for the animations which are really really well done so we should get hopefully no errors you might get a warning here that's just complaining about some line endings so I'm just going to clear that that's definitely not on the todo list so let's hop into the material UI folder and you can see that they've even included a star die scene this just has a standard camera with a white color it has a canvas with some different settings on it and just an event system which follows in any kind of canvas so you can see in the game right now we just have this right white screen so let's go ahead and add an element to this let's right click on the canvas let's go under material UI instead of UI and you can see we have a lot of a lot of different stuff just as in the unity we have a text as we have under the unity UI you also have a text here and a panel and all that stuff but we also have some extra elements such as radio buttons which is some selection boxes and stuff like that you can go crazy playing around with these so what we are going to select is just panel I want to make the panel from where we will select our question so you can see that it's already added this nice panel with some rounded edges and a cool shadow I'm going to make this darker so let's select our main camera and change the background color and if you've gone to presets here and click this button right here and you instead of having just the default you can change to one of these project presets right here and those are included with the material UI so I'm just going to select basics here and we can select the basic back dark background color here then we can find our panel open that go and do panel layer and let's change this color to the same one except maybe just a bit brighter there so something like this looks pretty good now we can select the entire panel and let's hold down alt and while we scale it on the horizontal axis almost all the way over here and let's now drag it up a bit something like there and then also scale it up something like that I think that looks pretty nice and you can always change this later now let's anchor this correctly so that it will scale correctly with the screen so let's first off yeah let's choose this one so it will stretch horizontally and be anchored to the top so if we now move our canvas here oops if we move our canvas you can see that it will follow and if we move the top here you can see that it will just follow the top but not scale vertically so that's perfect and what we can do is just take our scene view and put that over here this way we can have a nice preview of our game here and work on the right hand side so the next thing that we need to add is a couple of buttons that we can click I want our quiz game to have two states either the question is true or its false and depending on what you are choose you can get either a Kuwait correct answer or a wrong answer so that's kind of how we will model this out you could definitely have different options here you could say in what year was Jason born created and then you can have three different options if you want and that's completely fine it's the same basic concepts but I think for simplicity we're only going to have two so let's go under cabinets let's rightclick that and go under your material UI and let's select a button and it's going to be a text raised so you can see just how that looks and let's take this button and let's drag it over so it's aligned with the center and let's drag it up so it's aligned with our panel there and drag it down so it's around line with our bottom and let's take the same button and we don't want to align it here we want these surfaces to a line you can see that the box here is a bit bigger than the button itself that's because we have the shadow in there too so we'll have to drag it out here and just do an eye measurement that looks good used to create to align them there and you can see that that looks just like a sharp edge over there something like that looks pretty good and now we can go ahead and configure this button a bit so if we go under here actually let's just rename our panel here this is going to be the question panel weight statement pan panel whatever you want to call it and this down here is going to be the true button and we can go into the button layer go into the button text and let's delete the snap button to text because we don't want the size of our button to be controlled by the text and now we can take the font size here and scale that up dramatically let's also change the font type here from maybe Roboto regular to a Roboto a medium that looks pretty good and we also want to change the color here to a white down here using the preset that looks cool let's change the text here to true and then we can maybe scale it up a bit further something like that then we can take the button layer itself and let's make this a light blue something like that looks pretty good and yeah I think we will begin with that at least I actually want this text maybe to be just a bit wider or something like that and then let's make a second button so let's duplicate this true button let's move it over just like this so it's aligned let's make this the false button so change the name here to a false button and by the way to duplicate it I simply pressed ctrl D or command D if you're on the Mac let's go to the button layer and let's first change the color here want it to be completely red and actually the tint already looks very nice so maybe just a bit more saturated there and that looks super cool let's I open this up and go to button text and let's change this to false so there we go we have very clearly indicated with both both of colors and font that these are polar opposites now what we can do is maybe scale these buttons in a bit I think they're a bit too far apart so we can maybe just take this and if we okay so let's anchor them correctly first actually so let's take the true and the false button and change their anchors so we basically want them to scale with the entire screen on one axis but only half the screen on another axis so we want them to scale around the center here and then half the horizontal width yeah good so in order to do that let's make them stretch here and simply click that down here and then we'll make sure that if our canvas scales on the Y you can see that the button scale with it however it's not currently good on the X so we will select our true button and we'll take this Oh we'll take this anchor here if I can just click it there we go and move this all the way over this way when I resize the canvas you can see that that resizes in a nice way resizes with this part of the screen then we can take the false button and do the same except now we take the right part here and drag it all the way over so now when I resize the screen you can see just what happens here so that's actually completely perfect and if you want kind of a very tall the odd look the text is going to be clipping and this is not going to be looking nice anymore but then you might look into resizing the text or anything like that but for now we're just going to make it look great for this format what we can then do with the button says we can have this go a bit to the right so we'll maybe put in a negative 10 there and do the same with the false here so let's do negative 10 for the left so now they are just a bit closer together and I think that looks even better and then we can take the true/false and question panel and we can maybe just move them all up a bit just so they are completely centered on the screen and we could even go ahead and just scale it out just a tad so it fills almost the entire screen that looks great okay so I'm actually really satisfied with that I'm think we're going to stick with that for now you can always change this and spend more time on time on it than I do then under the question panel we want to right click go on to material UI and select text and we want to of course instead sort our actual question or statement of fact or whatever you want to call this we are just going to call it the question and we want this to be on this is a question actually it's a place holder good and will of course be changing this through code so it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time thinking about what this should say let's just scale that up I'm holding down alt and clicking here to make it scale with the entire panel and then we'll send you that on both the X and the y then we'll scale up the fund something like that let's make this the white color down in the presets here and I think that actually looks good you could go ahead and change the fund if you want a different look but I actually really like this and that's basically it I mean now we've created our UI and I'm going to show you just how cool the material UI plucking is because when I go ahead and hit play now we are not going to have any borrowing animations but if I click this you can see I get this really cool looking ripple effect so that's super awesome if you want a bit more of a hover animation you can see that currently when I hovered we do get a bit more shadow but we can also make it tint a bit so let's go and do that let's select our true button go into the button layer and do the same thing with the false button select both button layers excuse me the shadow normal size I want to change that to two and the shadow access active size I want to change that to three and then I wanted to also highlight when hover it so now when we play you can see that the shadow is a bit more clear and they actually tense so they react to the mouse hovering over and we still get that really cool ripple effect so that was basically it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'm definitely looking forward to the next one so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
