so here's something we have never tried before motion capture a couple of months ago XM's reached out to us and asked if we wanted to try out their motion capture suit and I first thought was we're going to need a bigger studio however at a second glance we realized that the suit just uses on body motion sensors this is really high in hardware and so you can imagine we were pretty excited when we received this very team spawned looking suitcase in the mail but before we look at what's inside this shady box this video is sponsored by a Skillshare Skillshare is an online learning community with more than 28,000 quality classes on game development tech and more you can for example check out this really cool class on how to use pro builder in unity it will take you all the way from installing pro product to learning how to sketch out your levels the course touches on subjects such as progress and the material editor sculpting and painting with poly brush and much more Skills is

all the included sensors wires battery packs and so on we were pretty overwhelmed with the amount of hardware packed together here the suit even came with a router for wirelessly connecting it to a computer and an action figure yes as for setup it wasn't without its difficulties accents had offered to set up a Skype call with us to help us get started and even with their help it took us quite a few hours to get everything working of course this process can be much faster if you know what you're doing the suit was fairly easy to put on we just had to place and link together all the sensors throw on a battery pack and the on suit computer and we were set since we have no prior experience with equipment like this we had some trouble getting the suit to connect to the computer in fact we ended up hardwiring this suit to a laptop in order to get it to recognize after that though everything worked flawlessly we calibrated the suit by getting Andreas to give us his best catwalk and voila the suit was tracking his motion in real time to a shocking degree of precision and pretty much without any input lag at this point we were pretty excited and dress broke out into a quick dance and oh oh we just recorded some quick movements to test out and with that it was time to import the movement into unity first the software did a processing pass by analyzing the movement and getting rid of imperfections as lat getting the animations into unity was as easy as exporting to an FBX in fact it was so easy that we didn't even try out the live link feature that allows you to see movements in unity in realtime so after setting up the write import settings in unity and downloading the Exxon's asset store package we managed to get the test character moving around the scene so we set up a quick example level and boom we had a dancing robot now we had the idea to search the asset store for free characters that we could try and apply this animation to in theory it should work as long as the character uses a humanoid rig and indeed it did in fact we had a crazy amount of fun quickly swapping out characters and I think it really shows the opportunities with using motion capture with an environment like unity it gives you endless amounts of opportunity to reuse animations across a wide range of characters so at this point we concluded that this suit works extremely well when it works and it's actually reliable when you start to learn the different tricks to making this software do what you want it to next up we wanted to try out on body recording so we enabled it through the software and when outside it was hilarious to watch andreas casually stroll down the street wearing well that we decided he looked like a mashup between an eighties Joker and a superhero recording outside was really easy press a button to calibrate and then press the same button to record first we went to the bench where we had shot the intro for this video we wanted to see if the tracking could be precise enough to allow him to sit on a bench in virtual space without sliding around as you can see from the recording it wasn't perfect the suit tracking works extremely well with horizontal movement but moving the core of your body on the yaxis seemed to cost the suit to realign a bit however we later found out that this was due to our lack of knowledge of this software as you'll see later I think we managed to work around it by blending together the good parts of the animation to clean it up a bit now remember this is just using raw animations with fast processing if you want you can always open up the animation in a standalone software to do Corrections however for this test we couldn't be bothered and in general we recorded under nutso ideal conditions we didn't record on Flag around in fact most of the places we recorded were on a slope and we also tried jumping on and from things which didn't turn out so well we decided to stay clear of height differences going forward but apparently there are features in the software that allows for better height tracking we just didn't know at the time however one thing that the suit did really well right out the box was jumping we managed to track andreas doing a backflip which I think looked really really cool especially on a big scifi robot and we also had him jump over an obstacle in this case me we asked him what we should replace me with in the unity scene and he requested a goat so we went goat shopping on the asset store of course unfortunately there weren't any free coats available so instead we decided on a symbol barrel from the western props pack I think it ended up looking really cold and it's so fun to be able to spectate the movement from different angles we also wanted to try having two characters interact with each other this was of course a challenge since we had to use the same suit for both characters we quickly put together a fighting sequence and had Andreas reenact both sides of the fight with me as a sparring partner considering that we recorded everything in less than 10 minutes the result was pretty great however I think this would have been the perfect place to use live link to preview what the animations look like with a sword and a shield in hand finally we of course had to put together a tiny game and I don't think there's any game more animation dependent than a fighting game so we had a dress go through various fighting movements and loaded them all into unity and then programmed a symbol controller to make the character change animation based on player input and that's pretty much it of course adding colliders hit detection reactions and all the gameplay systems is for another day and that's pretty much all we had time to do in this video of course a big thanks to accents for reaching out and letting us borrow this really cool suit also don't forget to check out Skillshare simply click the link in description and the first 500
