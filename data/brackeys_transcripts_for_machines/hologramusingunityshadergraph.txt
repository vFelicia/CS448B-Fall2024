a really cool effect that is used pretty often in both games and movies is the hologram in this video we'll have a look at how to create this effect in unity using shader graph towards the end we should have something like this and that's with pretty much anything that we make in shader graph we can really easily tweak it to make different results and yes we are using this lovely monkey again you could say that I am bananas for this model alright enough monkeying around let's get into the video also special thanks to Michael Neely Clinton fans Kira vo Infiniti PBR cheetah 3d and Alex and the player for their support on patron and with that let's get to it so we're here in the same symbol scene as always all we have is a camera two lights a bit of post processing as well as this monkey model and on this monkey of course we have a material that just uses standard settings so let's go ahead and create a new shader that's rightclicking the project go create let's go under shader and select PPR graph we'll name it something like hologram let's double click it to open it up in shader graph and I'm just going to maximize the you window here I'm also going to take the preview and dark it to the right and it's also move over a bit and now we're ready to start sculpting our shader and the first thing that I want to do is just be able to control the base color of our hologram right now we can do that here in the albedo channel but let's just go ahead and create a property for this so we'll go to the plus sign select color and we'll call this base color I'm gonna go ahead and pick some kind of color let's just try out a light green maybe and that's then take this property and plug it right into the albedo Channel and we can now see that our object is green next we want to use a texture to control the transparency of our object to do that we of course need to specify a texture so we're go ahead and create another property this time of type texture and we'll call it something like hologram texture and we can go ahead and choose a default texture here I've prepared two textures beforehand a hologram lines cool and a hologram lines simple I've discussed like the cool one right away but I'm gonna show you how different textures can affect the look of our hologram later and just to give you an idea of what these textures look like we can have a look at them here so the simple one is basically just a bunch of gradients stacked on top of each other this is super simple to create in a program like Photoshop we could even create this procedurally but it's just easier to supply a texture the second one is pretty much the same thing but I've gone ahead and made way more lines and I've also taken logic gradients and overlaid them on top this creates a much more complicated texture but I think it also makes the hologram look a lot cooler so jumping back into shadowgraph we are now ready to start using this texture if we just drag it into a workspace here we really just want to plug it directly into the alpha channel of our PBR node however remember we can't actually do this because the Alpha Channel takes in a different type than a texture so we first have to convert our texture and we do this using a sample texture node so to take the output of our texture we'll search for a sample texture there we go we can now see the texture being displayed here and we can finally take this and input it into our alpha now we won't see anything happening on our object just yet but that's because we need to change the surface from opaque to transparent and voila this already kind of starts to look like a hologram we can also rightclick on a preview and choose a custom mesh and I'm just gonna select our monkey here just so we get a better idea of what this looks like so as we can see right now our texture is kind of being overlaid on top of the UV of our monkey and that's what we want for almost all textures we want a certain part of the texture to correspond to a certain part of our model however in our case we really just want these lines to kind of scroll down a monkey not relative to the model but relative to our view luckily we can change the UVs that our sample texture uses to do this we'll go ahead and create another node will search for tiling and offset and here we have a bunch of control over our URIs we can tile them we can offset them and we can do something pretty cool that I'll show you in a sec so let's just link this up to the UVs of our sample texture and let's now take the input you've ease of our tiling and offset node here and let's plug in a screen position and right away we can see that our hologram lines change to now be overlaid kind of from the perspective of our screen and they're not wrapping around the sides of our model pretty cool we can go ahead and minimize this view here we really don't need that and drag it over we and also controlled the tiling of our texture here so if we wanted to tile it on the Y for example we can do that and I think it would be pretty neat if we could control this from within the editor so let's go ahead and create a vector to let's call it a hologram texture tiling let's just set the X to 1 and the Y to something like 3 the same numbers we have here let's drag it into a workspace and let's hook that up to the tiling input channel and now here comes the cool part because just like we controlled the tiling we can of course also control the offset and if you go ahead and offset on the Y we can actually see that we kind of have this effect where our lines are scrolling down our model and instead of setting this manually we can have this change over time so we'll go ahead and create a time node here we can take the current time of our game and if we just plug it directly into the offset we can see that the lines are scrolling right away of course it would be nice if we could control the speed of this so we'll go ahead and remove this connection and just create a quick multiply node in between so we'll create a multiply here and that will go from time into the offset and we don't want to multiply by two we want to be able to control this speed up here so we'll go ahead and create a vector one we'll call this the scroll speed let's set it to something like point 1 by default drag it down here and let's plug that right into the second channel off our multiply node and now we can see that we have these nice scrolling lines that are slowly moving down our monkey pretty darn cool I'm just gonna reorganize the notes a tiny bit here just to try and keep everything nicely tied together and that is kind of the first part of our effect in fact we could stop here if we just save this jump into unity and select our monkey material we're going to shader and graphs and select our hologram we can see that already it actually looks quite decent and if we play we should see that the texture is indeed animating and if you just want a very kind of lowkey hologram effect this could be it we'd go ahead and change the base color to say a light blue and you can see that we can easily control the look of our hologram this way also if we go ahead and select a different texture for example if we select these simple hologram lines we can very easily change the look of a hologram pretty drastically so I definitely recommend that you try and create your own textures and see what comes out on the other end so I'm just gonna change this back to the cool lines and let's try and kind of beef this effect up by adding some glowy parts so one thing that I really think could benefit this effect is a tiny bit of friend L let's open up a hologram and maximize it let's just go to the top here and we'll create a simple color node we'll change the mode to HDR so that we can make it glow I'm just gonna select some kind of pretty bright orange here and for the intensity I'm gonna set this all the way to something like four or five we can then also create a final node so we will create it for now effect and again we need to move this up a bit more and we've used this effect before in the introduction video and you can see that it just creates this cool radial ramp we can change the power here to modify the effect I'm just gonna set that to something like three let's then multiply this with our color so we'll output this into a multiply node and we'll also put the other one and we should get something like this we then take the final output here and drag it into the emission flood of our PBR master node and this looks pretty weird in the preview because it's not necessarily set up for HDR but if we go ahead and save this asset and have a look at it in our scene this is actually really bright so we can go in here and it's actually create the ability for us to modify this from within the editor so that's right click on the color node and it's converted to a property and so it pops up in our blackboard and we can go ahead and rename this to something like for nail color and there we go and let's now modify this to have a much lower intensity so we'll just set it to one for now and let's save the asset and that looks much nicer actually I think one might be a bit too small but luckily we can now adjust it from in here I'm just gonna try setting it to something like three so right away I think that helps our hologram pop a lot more and also think it helps bring out kind of the 3d feel of our object so that it's not completely flat but there's definitely still more that we can do with this if we go back to our shader I want to try and use these lines to add some emission as well in fact let's try taking the output of our sample texture here and we still want to feed this into the Alpha but let's create another output we're going to plug this into another node and I on a one note here which is simply going to take the texture and invert it and then take the output of this and multiply it together with our base color let's create a multiply node here and let's also take our base color and drag it into the output and I want this to go into the emission as well so let's go ahead and add these two emissions together let's remove this connection here and instead we can maybe take this entire branch here and move it out a tiny bit just to create some more room we now take the output off our for another fact feed it into an add node take the output from here and feed it into our secondary input and we can now see that the two are kind of overlaid on top of each other finally let's go from this add node here and it's feed that into our emission on the PPR master if we say that and preview it inside of unity I think it actually looks a lot nicer for me at least using the emission for some of the lines as well makes it feel like the hologram is actually part of a scene and it makes the hologram look much brighter and vibrant of course it completely depends on the look that you're going for I'm also going to go in here and definitely give our Fornell a tiny bit more intensity and now if we had play I think a hologram looks super cool and that's pretty much all I did for the effect shown in the intro the only thing that I added on top was a tiny bit of flickering light and making that it's actually pretty easy let me just quickly show you how it could be done so this is pretty much how all I did was create a time note and feed that into the seed channel of a random range this means that every frame we get a random number between 0 and 1 which creates this crazy flickering I then used a comparison node to see if this flickering is greater than point 9 and it's not really drawing the UI properly for me here right now but we can choose here whether or not we want to check if it's equal less or greater and of course Cho is greater here and this plugs directly into a branch node and it says if it is greater than 0.9 we're going to output a value of 1 and otherwise we're going to output a value of 0.8 just so are flickering won't be too crazy and this outputs into a multiply node where we multiply it together with our original emission and this of course feeds into the emission channel of our master node so if we say that and play that inside of unity we can see that our hologram kind of flickers every once in a while I might have gone a bit overboard with the effect here but I wanted to show you how that looks like you can of course fine tune the effect and the values to your liking yay let's pretty much it for this
