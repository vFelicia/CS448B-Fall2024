hello everyone and welcome to the sprinting tutorial done by Brad keys I am the CEO of Rockies and I know exactly what you're thinking sprinting well why not crouching hour crouching will be in the next video I make I promise so in there and we'll explain how to do crouching functionality and also how to merge the Sprint and Crouch scripts together but first of all we are gonna of course take a look at how to run so I have as always open up unity and I have made a new scene here just to demonstrate how sprinting and crouching would work and let's go ahead and select the player here and you can see that I have the finished script attached to him called the sprint and Crouch so this is what we are going to be making let's have a look so this is my default run speed and if I hold down the shift key you can see getting a lot faster and when I let go it goes back to normal if you hold down the ctrl key oh I'm sorry this C key for Crouch you can see that our character smoothly animates into a crouching position and my speed decreases and if I now hold down the shift key nothing happens so you can't sprint while crouching and that's basically it for this script let me just go ahead and show you what is actually happening inside of unity so if i zoom in on our character here of course when I sprint nothing happens but when I do the crouching you can see that the capsule Collider or rather the character controller which is just a capsule get scaled down so not the entire object gets scaled and you might be thinking that well that looks really weird he might be clipping through walls or floors but it's really just a graphic that looks weird the reason why it's done this way is because if we scale down the whole game object stuff like weapons and other things attached would be compressed also and so you would have to make a crouching animation for your your character on whatever you have instead of this object so I'll leave you to do that on your own but that's basically how the crouching and sprinting works let's get into creating the script so I'll hit the player and disable the sprinting Crouch script now go down to the project pane hit create JavaScript call this sprint drag it on to our player and doubleclick it to open it up in monodevelop there we have it now we can go ahead and delete the prac Maastricht you can also leave it be and we are gonna keep both the function start and the function update I'll just go ahead and space out the brackets the bracket keys and that's how I like it so now let's go to the top and declare some variables the first one is pretty selfexplanatory it's the one called walk speed and it's gonna be a type float and it's gonna be equal to let's say 7 so this is just the regular speed regular speed and the reason why we need this is because we need to set the speed to something that means that every frame when we are not sprinting or crouching this speed will be applied so we'll make a new one called you guessed it sprint speed which is also going to be a type float and it's going to be about let's say 13 this is gonna be the run speed alright so we are also gonna need to make some private variables private var if you're gonna call this char loader it's gonna be a type character motor and it's and let's make the semicolon another private variable is needed this one is going to be called char controller and it's gonna be a type character controller there we go so let's start out by in the function start telling these variables what they need to contain so basically why we need this is because of how we need the character to interact the charm motor will allow us to actually move the character forward or I should say change the speed of the character once we decide whether he's walking sprinting or crouching this character motor will allow us to change his speed this character controller will allow us to check if our character is grounded that means if he is standing on something or if he's floating in the air because we only want him to be able to sprint if he's standing on the ground so now let's go under the function start and let's type char motor the variable we just created equals get component and this is the type of function you use whenever you need a component from a game object and since there can only be one of every type of component we can just write character motor so this will take the character motor from our game object and play around with that so now the charge controller this is going to be equal to get component and then character controller and remember this script could be made without making these variables but then you would have to access the character motor and the character controller through the gate component each time you wanted to change something and that could be very taxing on your computer remember that every time you need to change something for example in the transform or access some information for example the character motor from the character controller then it's a really good idea to do what's called catch the data or cache and depending on how you would pronounce it but to cache the data in two different variables instead of having to do a search for them so that's really really handy so make sure you do that and the script will run a lot smoother so now let's go into the function update and that's right power speed no capital equals warp speed the variable above and semicolon so now we create a new variable every time it draws the frame and it's going to be called speed and it's by default gonna be equal to the walk speed now you're gonna check if character controller is grounded so that is grounded and then we're going to type and and that is done by making these two symbols and input dot get key get key see if I get this right left shift I remember if this isn't working for you it's because unity might have named it as something else or you have gone into the settings and named it as something else so you can always use input that gate key and then key code and then dot and you'll get a list of everything you need so that's a a good way to make sure that it will work but for now I'm just going to use this left shift end up the parentheses and now we are gonna make two symbols and it's gonna be these two here and these two standing brackets they mean that it could also be the input or whatever we are gonna write here so these ant symbols they mean and so if the character controller is grounded and the input key that left shift is pressed then we want something to happen and these mean or so if the character is grounded DFCS and the key dot K key left shift is press it isn't well then we can check if input dot get key and then right shift so that you can sprint with both the left and the right shift keys so remember the standing brackets means or now let's open up the brackets and inside of here we are gonna write speed this variable here equals sprint speed the one we made in the top so this script is simply gonna allow us to make sure that every time we draw a frame we want to create a speed variable which is going to be equal to the sprint speed if the character is standing and the key is pressed if not it's just going to be equal to the walk speed but this doesn't actually influence how our character moves to influence that we have to access the character motor so charm motor that movement dot max forward speed equals speed and here we are setting the speed so here we are making making the actual speed variable and here in the if statement we are checking for opportunity to sprint and here we are actually change in the speed to sprint so that is how our script is gonna look there's really not any more to it so let's go ahead and save this and head back into unity and let's try to see what happens here yeah we can see two variables pop up the block speed the sprint speed and indeed we have no errors so we can just go ahead and try to hit play and when I run forward and hold down the shift the speed does indeed increase so that's how to do basic sprinting in the next video we're going to take a look at crouching and maybe sometime in the future we'll also take look at how to do it actual sprinting bar so that our character can run out of craft that's it for now guys I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll see you in the next one you
