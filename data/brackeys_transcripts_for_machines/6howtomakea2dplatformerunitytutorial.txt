thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to video number six in the how to make a 2d platformer course wow it's been quite a while since the last one I've been having a bunch of audio problems but they should soon be over with I've come up with a temporary fix until I get them solved and also if you want to follow my progress in making videos and should something come up always write on Twitter so please go ahead and follow me at Brad key Street for more updates so let's get into today's video as you can see we're going to be doing a bunch of fixes first off we are going to fix the characters colors because there something wrong with those then we're going to change the pivot of the arm then we're going to set up the parallaxing to work with our tiling script which a lot of you have been been writing me about it should be an easy fix and then we are going to fix the problem with collision where we get stuck on certain colliders so all of this we are going to do in the visual editor we're not going to be scripting today so it should be pretty easy to follow along cool so let's get started let's first off open up unity and fix the characters colors so if we have a look at the character here select the player and focus on them you can see that some of the colors here are not as they should be they're pretty washed out and that's because last time when I did a video I forgot to change what is called the the color compression here the color format to 16bit so let's select the astronauts bright sheet and instead of hitting compressed let's change this to 16 bits this will be pretty accurate representation of the colors but if you want them to be completely accurate you can always do true color but I think 16 bits is going to be just fine for this character so now you can see it looks much better already we could do a go ahead and do this with the environment also we can see how it looks so change this to 16bit and now it's actually a bit more accurate than before again we can zoom in on the environment here and maybe compared so this is 16 bits and this is compressed so it's really up to you what you like the most we can also try to color and compare that to 16 bits actually I think I like true color on this quite a lot let's try and compare that to compressed mmm the difference is not big I think the 16 bits here is just a bit too vibrant in its colors I would like them to be just a bit watch washed out so I think I'm just going to leave it at compressed actually because the difference is not that big but you can leave it at true color if you want to of course compressed is going to be smaller in file size cool so now we can go ahead and move on to point number two which is changing the arm pivot because right now when we hit play you can see that our arm rotates towards our mouse cursor but it does so with a wrong pivot so let's have a look at our arm here zoom in on it so right now the pivot is all the way back here where the shoulders rotational pivot its anchor point would maybe be more like here so let's go ahead and change this we can set up what is called a custom pivot so let's select the astronauts bright field again and let's go ahead into and open the sprite editor let's zoom in on the arm here and instead of left pivot we're going to do custom and now we can adjust the X and the y to to Center the pivot where we want so we're simply going to take the X here and slide it over a bit and maybe bump up the wire bit so the X is going to be pretty much 0.18 and let's try 0.6 for the Y that's actually pretty good I think going to do five seven that looks just perfect so now that we've set that up we can hit apply in the top right always remember to hit apply in this window and then we can exit out and now when we select them you can see that it's centered where this shoulder actually is so now we can again Center this on the player to be where we like and when we go in game now and rotate the arm it looks a lot more realistic it looks like it's actually rotating around a fixed shoulder that's really awesome maybe we want to push this over just a bit there see how this looks yeah that's better cool so now that we have this fixed let's move on to point number three which is setting up the parallaxing with tiling this is pretty much what we've been waiting for right so what we can do here is it's actually quite simple so right now the problem is that when we turn on tiling under our GM object or parallaxing I'm sorry you can see that once we get over here to Wed start to tile on the tiles don't move with each other and the reason why is that when we are automatically spawning new tiles they aren't added to the backgrounds list so they won't actually be affected by the parallaxing script and we could do this by adding them to the list through code but instead of doing all that it's really easier to just have groups of objects that will all move together so instead of adding the background Mountains blue for example directly here adding the single object we're going to create a container which is just going to be an empty game object where all our background mounts and blue objects are going to be parented to and this way when remove the empty game object they will all move at the same time so let me just show you what I mean here so right now you can see that this isn't working over here they are overlapping but what we're going to do is we are going to create an empty object so command shift N or controlshiftn if you're on a Windows like me and then we're going to name this background mountains blue and then maybe we're going to change this to singular instead of plural so we have a difference so we can differentiate between the container and the single element and then we're going to just zero this out just for good practice so make sure it's centered and then what we're going to do is we're going to give this the same Z position as deep background Mountain blue because remember our parallaxing script will parallax the objects depending on the Z value so we have to make sure that this is the same Z value as the mountains blue in order for it to parallax correctly so in order to do this we're simply going to select the background mount in blue and then we're going to copy over the Z value and paste it into the background Mountains blue our container so now that they have the same D position we can simply parent the Hmong background mounts in blue to the background mountains blue simply drag it under there and now when we hit play oh yeah we also have to add the container here to the list so instead of adding the background Mountain blue this single element you're going to add the background mountains blue so we're going to add the container there we could also instead actually let's just do instead of mountains blue it's simply too similar so let's do background mountains blue container it's a really long name and then let's just change this back to mountains I think this naming is going to be a little better so instead of adding the background mountains blue we're going to add the background mountains blue contain so just drag that on there to replace it and now the blue background should actually tile correctly now when we jump over here you can see that they are perfectly tiling and the reason why this is working is because if we open up our parallaxing script and monodevelop so just double click it to open it up we're going to wait for it here while it's opening I can just quickly talk about the unity editor changes so one thing you will notice over here in the new version of unity which is always that unity 4.5 I'm going to get this wrong where this is it it's you can always view this by going to edit I believe nope window nope help and yeah about unity and you can view your version number here so this is 4.5 and they've added the ability to sort things in the hierarchy so you don't like you don't have to do this underscore GM methods anymore to get them in top of the hierarchy you can simply drag them around and and sort them yourselves so that's pretty awesome but anyway let's go back into monodevelop here and that was not the script I wanted I wanted the parallaxing script here and what you will notice is that we if we search for parent know oh it's not the parallaxing script we want we want the the tiling scripts so let's find the tiling here that's what I wanted so if we look at the tiling here and we search for parent you will notice that whenever we are creating a new tile or a new body we are setting its parent to the same as the other tile and that's why we can simply just parent it to the blue container because all the other tiles will automatically be parent it to the same object and we can see this when we hit play if we disable maximize on play and then hit play we can see that if we run over here when it creates a clone it's also parented to the blue container so now we can simply use on the same methods for all the other tiling elements so let's just go ahead and create a new object again let's throw this out let's call this background mountains purple container let's drag under the background mountains purple let's just drag this up here so we have all of the background so we have all of the containers at the same place and yeah that was yeah of course we also oh we have to adjust the Z position of the container here so first off let's just drag out the object again so we can copy over the Z position so take the background mountains purple copy the Z position to the background mountains purple container hit enter and now we can parent it so there we go and then again in the GM object instead of having the background Mountains purple we're going to drag in the background mountains purple container like this cool then we can do the last thing with the foreground dirt so let's do command shift n let's rename this to foreground dirt container let's zero it out let's select the foreground dirt copy over the Z position to the foreground dirt container and let's parent the foreground dirt to the foreground dirt container let's drag it up here so we have them all in the same place and then let's select the GM object and drag on the foreground dirt container cool so now whenever you want to adjust the parallaxing of these elements make sure to select the entire container and not the individual objects awesome so now when we hit play all of our elements are correctly tiling and parallaxing as needed so that was awesome so that was the third a third pint here now we're going to go ahead and fix the collision so right now when we hit play and we jump into a Collider here and just keep on holding in the direction we are jumping here you can see that we get stuck and then when I really release the key it just waits like a half a second or something and then it falls and that's of course not something we want we don't want to get stuck to objects in this way and the fix is actually quite simple we're going to use what is called a physics what's called a physics object it's a physics material here so you're going to make a physics 2d material so right click in the project pane go to create physics 2d material and let's rename this twoplayer mature player physics fish mat let's do that player first mat and then the friction we're going to change this to zero so whenever you've zero out the friction you will make sure that we don't get stuck on walls so now when we select our player find the rigidbody component and then no actually not the rigidbody I mean the collider component the Box Collider here we can drag under the player physics and we are going to do the same to the circle Collider so now that our player frisomat is selected in both the circle Collider and the Box Collider when we hit play you will notice we behave just as before but when I jump into a platform we won't get stuck and of course you can adjust this effect if you bump up the friction just a bit something like 0.2 it will actually hang on completely now that make sense okay so you have to just throw this out completely because the friction it doesn't matter when you have a constant pole so make sure the friction is set to zero and that problem will be solved cool so that was basically it for today's video I know we didn't code in this one but we got a lot of stuff done and the game is now a little more enjoyable to play it just makes more sense so sometimes you just have to get the boring stuff done and just get the fixes out of the way so you can continue adding new stuff in the next video I think we'll delve into some character animation and then hopefully we'll soon get on to some shooting so that's going to be really awesome so thanks for watching again if you want more updates on when I post videos and what I'm working on and all that cool stuff you can follow me on twitter at Braca street or find me on facebook at facebook.com slash brakus so that was basically it for today thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
