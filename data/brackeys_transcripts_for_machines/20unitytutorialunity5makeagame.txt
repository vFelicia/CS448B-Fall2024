thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to make a game number 20 in this video we're going to be porting over our current project to the all new unity 5 I'm sorry but it's quite a long time since I've made a new video in this series but I've been moving and so things have been quite busy but let's get right into it first off if you don't have unity 5 already visit unity 3d comm click get unity and just download the free personal edition everything that was before pro with the engine is now free so we have a bunch new features here along with some newly added stuff also if you have any questions throughout this video as always we said the Brack is forum cool so I promise that this is going to be the last unity 5 porting video but I just wanted to show you how this is done for the mega game project so that everyone is able to follow along so when you've downloaded unity 5 just doubleclick it to open it up and it's going to prompt you to open up a project let's click open other let's navigate to wherever you have your projects stored and before you actually open up your project and convert it over I recommend that you find it in your finder and I'm going to find mine here and then just copy it over on the desktop just so you have a duplicate shoot anything with the process go wrong unity 5 is still very new and so some conversion problems may occur so once that is done find the project that you want to convert over hit select folder now click upgrade and unity is going to reimport the assets to the new unity 5 standards also what it will do is it will update the scripts that you've made so that they will be configured to the new API there's been a few API changes meaning changes in the way that we do programming in unity and it actually has an automatic converter for those to just take out the old bits and insert the new syntax or they say so we'll just say that we've made a backup and we would like it to do so you can of course say that you don't want that and then just change it on your own should this not work but for a similar game like ours it's pretty much ensured to work so once it does that it's going to open up a fresh scene and you can see that a a fresh scene in the new unity looks quite different from the old one and if we load up let's say our main menu some things might have changed a bit such as the skybox not working but what I want to do is I want to convert all of the materials to the cool new unity standard shader setup a better lighting system and then of course fix this skybox issue that's most of what we're going to be doing today so let's start out by fixing the skybox because that's horrible to look at so let's find our main camera let's find the skybox here let's double click it and you will see that it locates it in our project and selects it and we now have some more things that we can change with a sixsided skybox but we actually want to leave all these options what we do want to do is to click fix now and the reason that this error occurs is that this texture contains alpha but it's not our GBM so it means it's incompatible with what is called HDR rendering and I'm not going to go too much into what that actually means just know that HDR is awesome and that if you can most likely you want to use HDR rendering it's basically a technique that will make sure that you have lots of details detailed both in the dark paths and bright parts of your image without HDR you pretty much has to have to choose so let's now hit fix now for all of these and you can see the problem tada disappears so with that done you can of course do it on all of your other sky boxes if you want to use them also but with that done what we can do is we can create a new scene so let's save this one let's do ctrl n to create a new scene let's do ctrl shift s to save this scene let's call this main menu reported or modified or whatever and this is going to be our new main menu scene and then I want to open up our old man menu I want to select all of the stuff in here and copy it over we could change all of the different parameters individually but that would mean going over quite a few things and if you want to know how the new unity 5 lighting system really works I suggest you check out the new unity 5 primer video that I've done I think it's called get up to speed with unity 5 and it's of course on the channel so if you want to really know what what is new in unity 5 I suggest you visit that video because it's simply too much to cover here I mean it's an hour long but I will show you how we can easily do this so if we select all of our objects if we then exclude our Sun because we want the default Sun from the other scene then press ctrl C to copy it then we move over to our new scene in menu port it press find our main camera here and delete that one and then press control V then you can see that now everything has now that now the new lighting system takes over here so that's really cool and we can just save that and you can leave the old main menu but I'm just going to delete it and open up the new one so you can see that already a quite a few things have changed but we can make this look much nicer so the first thing I want to do here is I want to select our directional light and have a look at what's changed in here first off you will notice that it has a a bit of a color here it's tinted a bit brow a bridge yellow which gives gifted this kind of a warm nice feel it also deforms to soft shadows which was for before a pro feature but is now included in unity personal Edition so that's really awesome and you can see how that looks down here we're just going to have it set to quality settings of course if you are exporting to a mobile game you will need to use lower settings and so it's fine that if it that they just carry over from our quality settings in here currently I have set it quite high cool so let's go back here where was I let's see the directional light here so that's pretty much all you need to know about that you can see that there are some new parameters here such as the bounce intensity this basically controls how much bounce light is going to be applied from our Sun but that's not really something we need to mess around with yet because we don't have the shaders applied so let's go ahead and fix the shaders so first thing we want to do here is we want to find our ball here we want to open up the mesh renderer go into materials and select the ball would select it in the project panel and you can see that it's currently using the legacy shader called bump diffuse this is pretty outdated so let's change change this to the standard shader you can see what this does it's quite a bit too much here but it gives it quite a lot of smoothness some nice rim lighting and a specular it almost looks like wet wood as is so what we need to do here is basically nothing nothing because the diffuse map carries over to the OB Doe and the normal map also carries over to the normal map slide but we can maybe bump down the smoothness a bit because that's just a bit too much so let's do something like 0.25 and maybe even this that's up to you I do like a bit of rim in here I think it gives a a pretty cool look so what we can also do is we can select our arm platform and we can do the same to that I do how we want to select the platform under the standard oops under the prefabs so that we can change it for all of them you can also just select this one and hit apply which we're going to do just make sure it really affects all of them all so let's actually we don't have a prefab fireball that's funny yeah we do it's right here but for some reason there is no apply button here maybe I already hit apply let's all we only change something on the material of course and it's going to affect all of the instances that's me being Seletar sticking or that will continue cool so find the ground brick legacy shader and again change this to the standard shader you can see what that does I'm just going to locate the material in the project panel so we can select that instead of the cube and then let's get rid of these colliders and you can see that this already looks a lot better what we can do is maybe bump down the smoothness a bit on this you can have a look at what it looks like if it was a spherical down here so something like 0.2 actually let's give it a little more let's do is 0.25 and you can also control the amount of normal map the amount that we want our normal map to affect our our texture so I currently it's set to 1 I think this could maybe be bumped up to 2 so we really get this coollooking 3dimensional brick unfortunately we don't have any height map or occlusion map or anything like that or anything to control the the specularity either but I think this already looks a lot better than it did before so let's continue here I think that was basically all we want to do with these two shaders at least and you can just see how powerful the new standard shader is you're going to use this for 99.9% of all your shader work because it simply does so much and it's also I assure you very well optimized so that's really cool and then now let's save this what we also want to do is maybe change back our skybox you can of course keep this one if you think it looks cool I sure do but you will notice that if we in our scene view it shows this guy box but in our game view it shows another one and the reason for this is that on our main camera we currently have one skybox selected but we have another one as default and we can see this if we go in the window lighting and this is a really really important panel in here we first off set the default skybox and the Sun we can just drag in our directional light here as the Sun and maybe we also want to rename this as underscore Sun or just Sun that's up to you I like underscore Sun and I'm going to put it at the top with music and one thing we can also do is going to select the Sun go to the inspector and Magid s static we can do say the same with our platform here then hit apply and this means that whenever we change some lighting it will be baked onto the platform because the really cool thing about the new unity lighting system called them Lydon is that it will automatically know if something is static to bake as much lighting as it can onto that object so it will figure out the best way to get realistic lighting without it ever breaking because something has moved so that's really cool but let's go back into our lighting panel and in here we can of course change the skybox you will however notice that if we do that the lighting becomes very very sharp so you can keep this one and then just overlay the skybox on the camera which could look pretty good or you can change it to this one and then maybe just bring down the ambient intensity bring down the reflection intensity and you can see now it's that looking a bit better that's of course up to you what you want to do with that but the cool takeaway here is that as the ambient source of the lighting we know no longer just need to select the color but can actually get from a whole skybox which gets a just much more realistic looking result so that's something you can do I might actually go ahead and change it back to the default one I almost like that one better for this yeah I think that looks pretty good actually so let's let's keep that maybe bring down the reflection intensity just a bit and then we can then we can go back to our main camera and we can enable the overlay skybox there so this is how it's going to look and I like that look very much cool so the next thing we will do is update our level and we can now rename this to main menu just just main menu not ported and we can head into level one so as you can see in here it doesn't look as good it's kind of dying right now and the shaders are of course not really playing well together with the old lighting setup so what we want to do is again create a new scene let's save this as level 1 poured it let's head into level 1 and let's select everything except the Sun and let's just uh press oops let's press ctrl C to copy this head into level 1 pointed and press ctrl V to paste it all in call now let's rename our directional light to underscore Sun just to keep up with the rest of our project it's good to be consistent and just drag the GM and Sun to the top of the hierarchy then you can of course fiddle with the sun's settings if you want to change some of that I'm just going to leave it as is for now at least but you can see there's quite a few things that doesn't look really nice as is right now so first off I want to disable this coin because it's interfering with our lining and we want to see just how it looks without any lighting or a secondary lighting applied then I want to take the main camera here and drag it up a bit and rotate it down a bit just so it looks a bit more like when we are playing also I want to delete the oh that was the old camera I want to delete the old camera there and then drag up the new camera a bit to give it kind of more the angle that it actually has when we hit play so you can see that that looks a lot better so it doesn't jump awesome and now you can see that the shaders are already looking much much better here the cube power is very very bright and the reason why is it's using the old legacy shader so we can just quickly change that let's hit under the materials folder and we actually have an unnamed one which I'm going to delete here we also have this cube one default you can also just delete that let's then make a new material and let's just call this oops let's just call this um actually that's called this default let's drag it onto the cube and let's just bump down the albedo a bit here we can maybe also make it metallic if you wish or bump down or up the smoothness it's completely up to you I'm just going to make it nonmetallic and then a bit gray here just so it does it isn't as overblown and crazy like it was before I'm actually going to bump up the smoothness a bit so you can see what that looks like on a sphere down here cool so now that that is taking up our the intention of the eye let's adjust some of the lighting settings again as the skybox I'm going to leave the default skybox I think that gives a cool look then maybe bring down the ambient intensity just a bit and maybe also the reflection just a tiny tad actually it's mostly the reflection I like the ambient intense so let's just leave it up there and this is of course a lot of fiddling I have so you can of course spend more time on it than I am I just want to get along with the tutorial and then for the coin if we enable this let's first off disable the coin light and let's change the material here because that looks really really boring as is so let's go into the glowing material that's instead of the legacy shader actually use the standard shader let's change the albedo here to white actually I'm going to make it a bit darker than white so a very light gray then I'm going to bump up the metallic Ness so we get this coollooking shine here and the smoothness about half ways so we get this really shiny looking thing and then to actually color this bright orange I'm going to use the emission and I'm not actually going to use the emission to emit light I'm just going to use it to color our surface in a way that looks like it's emitting light so if we set this to let's say one and then instead of this white here change it to an orange you can see kind of what that does so we get this bright looking yellow coin but it also has this nice shine to it so we can just play around round with that maybe darken it a bit maybe make it a bit more reddish and you can see what that does I actually think this looks very very cool and when we then turn back on the coin a light and maybe even color this more orange like this you can see that it really looks like an orange coin that is actually a meeting light or almost a gold coin here so I think that looks a lot better we have the shiny feel and the color of the light is is more attended towards the actually color of the surface I do however want to boost a bump down the intensity a bit maybe set it to one instead that looks better wait for it to bake on the ground objects here and yeah I'm actually quite satisfied with that so that's awesome I do how we want to select the coin light and make sure that the baking is set to real time because this baking effect does look really nice we get some nice bounce lighting and all that but if we kinda hit play and pick up the coin you can see that the light doesn't disappear so in order to take care of this instead of mixed we want to set this to real time only because we know that the coin is going to disappear at some point now let's hit apply and maybe make a coin more over here because I think it's a bit too boring only having one in the scene so let's go into the prefabs and drag the coin over there let's drag this up a bit something like that looks super cool and now let's hit play and enjoy the new coollooking make a game lighting and shaders so that's basically how to port the game over to unity 5 this was pretty easy because everything we had to change was basically in the rendering everything else was pretty much behaving as we hoped it would the the script the script importer or API changer their work just as it should and we have no audio issues and and all that so that's perfect and now that we have that out of the way we can hopefully focus on improving this game so I think in the next video I hope in the next video that we can make a cool model or import a cool model and make it work in game for our enemy so that doesn't look like a box anymore that would be really cool and I hope if that's ready for the next video so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
