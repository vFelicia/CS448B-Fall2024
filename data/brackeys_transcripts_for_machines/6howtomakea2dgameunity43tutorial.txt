thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone welcome to episode number six in going to Dee today we are going to reset and restart our ball whenever the player scores and also just do a few cool fixes here and there to make the game better these are things we need to get out of the way before we can start doing sound work which will we'll probably do in the next episode so as always I've opened up unity and if we go in here let's first off select the ball and just Center it because it does noise me that it needs to be all the way up there now that we have this ball centered we can go ahead and take a look at what happens right now when the ball goes out of the screen we can see that our score it goes up but the ball doesn't reset and also another thing that that is not like it should be is that these two numbers it might be hard to see are a little bit to the right and the reason why is because whenever you are Center something in unity it centers from an anchor point and when it comes to DUI like text that our anchor point is by default in the top left corner so what we need to do in scripting is we need to subtract about half the width of the both the 0 and the 1 here so that it will be actually centered so if we go ahead and find out GM object go under the game manager script so double click it to open it up in game monodevelop we can go down here where we create our labels and then here we subtract 150 from the center but we also need to subtract half the width and I've played around with this a bit and it lies about 12 points so that should be just fine in here because we say plus 150 we still need to say because it's still oriented in the left hand corner so just do 112 hundred and 12 on both of them so let's see and now these are centered so that might have been hard to see but if we moved up our ball in the center you could see that they were not perfectly aligned cool so what we can do now is we can take care of the ball resetting and restarting so to do this let's open up the game manager know the that's the ball script we need to take care of here so go on the ball then ball control and we can see right now whenever we start the game we just do a random function that will make it shoot out to either side and first thing I want to change here is because I think it's a little bit slow as is so I want to change this to something like 100 or 110 you can of course go ahead and make a variable for this actually let's just go ahead and do that so let's call this bar ball speed make it a float value and make it equal to let's say 100 by default then in here instead of 80 we're just going to write ball speed and here in negative 80 we're just going to do minus 1 times ball speed actually I'm pretty sure you can just do ball speed let's see if you can do that so let's save it out and we get no errors hopefully no we don't and now the ball speed is 100 and that's just a little faster cool umm yeah so what we could do here is instead of just having it start right when the game opens because that it gets pretty hectic and most of the time the ball just goes flying off before you get to react and let's put a little bit of a yield statement in here a little bit of a wait so one let's move all of this code into another function that we can call when we want to so let's control X that or command exit so let's cut it and then down here write a function called function let's do go ball and here open up some brackets an inside of this function we can simply paste all everything we copied before so that's all this function needs needs to do and so up here in the function start we can simply say yield wait four seconds so this will delay the next action by two seconds because we've inputted the number two and again you can make this into a variable if it's something you want to tweak and then then let's do COBOL so now when we play the game if we save this and go back into unity we will play it it will wait two seconds and then launch the ball which is just perfect for just getting your fingers ready on the keyboard and such great so next thing is we need to be able to reset our ball whenever we want so let's do another function called reset ball and oops there and then the brackets and inside of here we are first off going to yeah let's first just and make the velocity zero so that okay let me just show you this actually if we just used to transform that position dot X and set that to zero and then use the transform that position that Y set that to zero on the problem one right now is that when we call the reset ball it will be centered but it will fly out immediately and the reason for this is that it still has the velocity that is it's generated so if it's traveling at a velocity of a hundred it will just teleport back here but still fly out so what we need to do is we all need to also reset the velocity so before the transform that position we need to say rigidbody2d dot velocity dot y equals zero and just the same with the x value so ready to body d dot velocity dot x equals zero and what we then want to do is we want to put in a yield and because we are currently playing and we already have our hands on the keyboard and such we'll just do something like 0.5 seconds and then say go ball and so once we call the reset ball function we it will Center everything wait for half an second and then shoot out the ball so that's all we need to call from our sidewalls so now let's go into our side wall script you can find it under GM and then left wall and then double click it and in here right after we bump up the score we need to say reset ball so we simply call this by first off using our reference to the ball and that's the hidden foe because we have collected some info about what's hit this Collider we've called this info hit info we've checked if this Collider this actual lead the ball and so now we can assume that inside this if statement hit info is our ball so we can simply do hit info that game object and this is more efficient than searching for the object or referencing it through a value variable because then you have to make sure that that variable so always stay connected and such so hit info that game object and then we can do that send message and then we need to open up a parenthesis and in here we simply write the name of the function which is reset ball and whenever you need to write something in strings it will probably not throw an error if it's wrong so it's just a good idea to go in copy the function name inside of the strings here just to avoid errors enter then just close this up and it will call the function reset ball whenever we hit a wall so now when we hit play and the ball just flies out it resets wait for half and second and then goes back so now you can see this is working just how we want it and if we start if I start at actually playing here we can see that our game is is quite fun to play great of course if you want to make this game harder you can add some randomness to whenever it hits a player so that you can't quite predict the X velocity and you can do this inside of the Impala control script here with the on collision enter you can simply add some random Y velocity using random range so that's your challenge for you to figure out and please if you can get it to work write it in the comments so that other people can can use it also great so that's pretty much it for the first part of this video that's just actually the whole video let's just first off when we hit play now because the velocity is is higher it can sometimes looks like it looked like the ball is going through our players especially if we bump it up even more it really depends on your frame rate and my frame rate is not too great because I'm recording but if we just try to bump up the ball speed by selecting the ball and changing the ball speed to let's say 130 and now hit play let's see if I can catch it we can see that it looks like the ball is colliding all kinds of weird ways and really with a good frame weight it should look like the ball is coming in and then going right past and then bouncing off so just to avoid these weird kinds of collisions I'm going to first of all keep the ball speed at about 100 you can go up to 130 if needed but I'm also going to select the player here both players and then I'm going to take the Box Collider exercise and I'm just going to bump this up a bit so just bump it up to something like 0.45 let's do 4 3 and that just makes the collider more solid and it will just give an overall better results so when we now play it's just more solid and it reacts better to the bowl that's something to play around with until it works for you again it really depends on the framerate the size of your game all that's weird stuff so that's basically it for this video I know it was pretty short compared to many others but next time we can go ahead and do some sound break so if you just want a quick teaser maybe you can see here in the 2d assets pack I've found some audio I found some game over audio which have made a bonus audio and a hit audio so I'm not going to play it but that's for next time so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
