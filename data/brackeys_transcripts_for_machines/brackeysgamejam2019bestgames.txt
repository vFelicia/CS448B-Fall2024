a few weeks ago we hope this second official break is game jam a competition where you get one week to make a game from scratch and we were so overwhelmed with how many people participated in the jam over 1,700 people joined and we got more than 300 submissions which makes it not only twice as big as the first Jam but also the fifth biggest gem in each history so before we start going through the amazing entries I just want to say a huge thanks to everyone who participated in the Jam and helped make it a success over the past few days we've been playing a bunch of submissions and while all of them are awesome in their own way there are a few that we would like to show in this video so without further ado let's have a look at my favorite games from the second practice game jam but first

was love is blind and I'm really impressed with how many unique games you guys were able to come up with based on this theme take for example the game note to self which is about a person who is so in love that he has literally gone blind and you have to help him get safely to his destination I think this game is cool because instead of controlling a character you are manipulating the world around him and also the menu and cutscenes are just amazing another example of guiding the player on his path to love is my love is blind here you have to guide your love home using your voice gameplaywise this works by moving the player in the direction of your mouse when clicking however it's not only the player that reacts to your voice also enemies and platforms which means that you suddenly have to plan out when and where to use it the game combines that with some really great audio work and it's just an overall fun experience and talking about audio sightless is a game where you essentially use sound to reveal the world around you things like movement shooting and shouting will enhance your vision but also attract enemies it felt to me like a fusion of superhot and the horror game perception which worked really well the only thing I would change about this game is to make the levels a tiny bit less complicated and the jump puzzles easier since I often found myself getting stuck but after playing white Heights I was starting to think that it might just be my jumping skills that are subpar this is a game by the same guy who made last gleam for the previous gem and man this one blew me away the gameplay is fast paced the music is thrilling and the graphics are as crazy as they are cold and on the subject of crazy have you ever wondered what would happen if you went Sambi fishing with a brain as bait I have but I didn't think I would find the answer here in the pide fishermen of Hamelin your task is to lead all the zombies out of the city your only friend a fishing rod I guess there's not much more to say about that now one of the games that struck me the most is heart bound in this game you help these two robots find love on their endless journey into the unknown and I think that's exactly what the graphics in the game feel like endless the way that the platform's fade into nothingness and the paths that just keeps continuing smoothly from one level to the next makes the world feel large with very few elements the game also begins with an incredibly simple yet effective tutorial in fact I think a lot of the games did a really good job on introducing the game to the player take for example the menu for now I see I think it does two things very well first it helps set the atmosphere of the game but more importantly it teaches the player the main mechanic before the game even starts I really like this detail because menus are often quickly thrown together it should just be a place where you configure settings so it's nice to see this one working so well so if you've ever wondered what a guy madly in love looks like just take a look at the character from why do you love I absolutely love this character and the gameplay is super fun a bit much blood for a love game but to be honest the animations and sound effects are half the fun and I think it was generally really impressed with the amount of work you guys were able to put into graphics and detail the game for you I'll become a hero is a cyclic story based platformer and I just can't believe how much these two guys were able to do in a week's time the game has tons of beautiful sprites cutscenes a menu a very large level a shop with cool items and even a progression system pretty much the only thing for me that gave away that this was a jam game is the fact that the movement felt a bit clunky but still great job guys another game that really caught me off guard was love machine first of all the concept is extremely well done the game is about a machine from outer space that tries to learn how to love and by analyzing human behavior it concludes that we as a species are incredibly fond of violence because of this it starts killing Earthlings to improve its love or level of violence expertise now that's of course a good wordplay but the best wordplay of the jam and perhaps of all time I give to you significant order extremely cute and also followers it's a super fun and very dangerous game if you don't watch out you might end up spending hours just trying to beat your high score it reminds me a lot of cross the road which I have spent so much time on back in the days I really like the idea of getting more and more followers the only problem was I didn't really understand exactly what they were good for except serving as extra lives perhaps implement a bonus based on how many followers she crossed the road with super fun game and man did it feel awesome running through all the cars as ghosts now I am puzzled pun intended by hot Ronin I was by the puzzle game television it is super innovative as you have to turn on and off your vision in order to get past the guards and safely reach your true love at the top of the tower the graphics are what they are but for some reason they kind of grew on me if I were to change one thing it would be the number of steps you are able to take while blind since often you can take more steps than needed to complete the level this would make the game harder and force the player to find the shortest possible path and talking about paths love is blind is a store for princess trying to find the path transitions trial of before it's too late it's as well written as it is drawn and the atmosphere had me captivated from start to end as a reviewer said this one really captured the feeling of blindly stumbling around a dungeon and talking about blindly stumbling around dungeons this next game has exactly nothing to do with that does however have something to do with teamwork all I see is you is the only coop game we decided to feature it splits the screen into two and the players are forced to guide each other through the level what makes this amazing is that you have to completely rely on your partner's directions since you're totally blind on your half of the screen actually that is kind of like blindly stumbling around the dungeon that transition just kind of wrote itself has checked nice heart Quest is a throwback to old retro platformers and I personally really enjoyed the aesthetic what impressed me about this game was how varied the levels were I've been playing for good while jumping around onto this starry night sky and then suddenly everything was on the ground and claustrophobic super cool I also want to mention the game make a weird heart first of all what second of all yeah that's been much the feeling I had when playing this game the graphics and sounds are really cool and for some reason don't ask me why I was quite amused to in playing this one it's a no rules make what you want a bit type of game another game I had a lot of fun with is bullet heart it's just a very solid bullet hell game clean graphics snappy controls and a mechanic that allows you to slow down the game with the tradeoff that you start to see less of the screen one it's also frustratingly hard but in the good way and finally we have the last thing she saw this is a game about a photon making it to someone's eyes while listening to her story it's a symbol and really solid platformer that was challenging but not too hard and the story kept me engaged from start to end and that's pretty much all the games we have time to cover in this video of course there are so many amazing games that we haven't talked about so I definitely encourage you to go play them yourself that's of course a link to all of them in the description finally I would just like to thank aqua XV code Myst job Maiko Jillian and the touch magic card for organizing this amazing event thanks to
