in this video we'll have a look at applying textures to our object but to do that we'll first have to go through the process of UV mapping UV mapping is something that a lot of beginners find really frightening but don't worry it's really hard I'm sure I'm just kidding so let's get started UV mapping is the process of projecting a 2d image a texture onto the surface of a 3d model to do this successfully we have to map out what parts of the image correspond to what parts of the model this is done by unwrapping it at this stage we imagine that our model is made of paper and that we want to unfold this paper to lay it out flat to make this easier we can cut our paper along the edges of our model these cuts are called seams so to start UV mapping our barrel we switch into the UV editing layout now here we have two windows that we want to focus on on the right of course we have our 3d viewport and on the Left we have our UV editor so this is the 3d view and this is the 2d surface that we lay out our UVs on we don't need this panel so I'm just going to get rid of it so first we want to hit tab to go into edit mode and our barrel is made up of three different pieces we have the main barrel and we have two rings the first thing we want to do is insert some themes I want to create a seam that separates the top part of our barrel from the sides let's hold down alt and right click in order to select the entire edge loop we can do the same at the bottom let's hold down shift and Alt + right click now we use our quick search by hitting space to search for mark seam and let's hit enter we now see that these edges are Mike with red what I also want to do is create a seam along this side of the barrel imagine that we're cutting through the barrel and we're laying out the sides here it's probably easier to just show you let's switch into H select mode let's select all the edges along the barrel here and let's again hit mark C so now if we go back into vertex mode select a single one of these vertices and hit the L key it's going to select the entire wooden part of our barrel we then hit u to bring up our UV mapping controls and unwrap now this might be really confusing to you in the beginning but what we see here is the wooden part of our barrel laid flat actually something really cool is that we can go down here and hit this little button this one I'll sync our selection between the two windows so if we deselect and go through and select different parts of our UVs we can see it's selecting different parts of our as well and so if we use our bug selection by hitting B to select the two top parts here we can see that that is the top part and button part of our barrel and that everything at the bottom of our UV map is actually the sides of our barrel you can also see that when I select the size of our barrel the outer rings here is ID of a swamp that's because these are the places where the sight connect to the top and bottom and so they are two selected now let's switch out of this mode and have a look at our two metal rings actually want to unwrap these in much the same way we did the barrel I want to Margaret seam at the top of our rings that's it Mike seam and at the bottom of our rings and I also want to make a cut right through them so go into edge select mode and select an edge going through both again Mark C let's now go back to vertex select select both our rings and hit u to unwrap here we can see four circles that's the upper and bottom part of each ring and two lines that's the outer part of our rings and this is why I'm going to show you something really cool because we could just go ahead and use these UVs as is meaning that we could go ahead and paint on top of them to add color but this is actually laid out in a really inefficient way because right now each individual side of our ring is using up texture space and I don't think we're going to have some different textures on each part instead we could use the same texture for both the bottom and top part of both rings to do that we select the vertices on one of the rings hit L to select the entire ring we then hit G and overlaid on top of one of the other rings and we keep doing this until all of the Rings are overlaid at the same place so now whatever we put here in our image is going to be displayed on all of the Rings in fact we can do the same thing with both our bands here we can select one of them hit L then grab it and hit Y to only move it on the y axis and there we go now we only need to text you one of the Rings and it will be applied to both so let's select these rings and move them up on the yaxis let's also move the rest of our rings up here if we then go ahead and select our entire object in the 3d view port you can see that we have plenty of space for our entire model series in fact we could go ahead and take the two bottom and top parts of our barrel here and even scale them up a little now that's of course a bunch of stuff and advanced techniques that we could use to improve this UV layer but for now this is going to work just fine so that's by overlaying a texture to do that we go down here we hit new we can give our texture and name I'm just going to call it feral you can give it some dimensions 1024 is plenty for our case you can give it a base color choose whether or not you want transparency on the parts that aren't textures in our case we'll just leave that off and you can choose to generate a texture if you select blank your entire texture is going to be black but we could also go in here and generate say a color grid these are useful for testing your UV layout so if we hit okay now we can see a color grid is generated and if you go to our 3d viewport and change our mode to texture voila our texture is now overlaid on top of our model this is probably easier to see if we switch out of edit mode and let's also go back to the default layout we'll probably need to change back to texture again so as you can see our UV map is not perfect we have a little distortion on a texture the lines aren't totally straight we also have a visible seam going down the side of our texture and you can definitely also see the seam at the top here but I think if I first go at unwrapping an object you can definitely be proud of it now that we've unwrapped our object it's time to texture it and there's pretty much a million ways to go about that some paint onto the models using software like ZBrush or mud box and some paint onto the 2d layout using some kind of photo editing software like Photoshop often bundled with quick so so texturing is a science in itself but especially if we're going for a low poly look it's actually fairly easy the first thing that I like to do is bake an ambient occlusion map ambient occlusion is the sort of shadows you get when two objects intersect and having blender automatically calculates this gives a really good base to work off of so in our default layout let's go over to the render panel that's the camera that's going to edit mode and select our entire object let's go down to where it says baked and the bake mode we want to set to ambient occlusion if we now hit the back button blender is going to do a bit of calculation and voila you should now see ambient occlusion on your object we see that we have some shadowing here at the top of our barrel and at the edges of our Rings and if we go into our UV editing mode we can see the texture now this texture is just an image and we can open it in any software and play around with it if you want to add stuff to a barrel in paint do so so let's try and export this image out let's go to image save as image I'm just going to say into my projects folder let's call it barrel that PNG hits save as image we navigate to the place where we saved our image a good free application for doing texture work is personally I use Photoshop so let's just drag in our barrel here and that's some different stuff we could do with this I'm just going to begin by adding a curves adjustment and making everything a bit brighter I'll then go and select text and then add a company name to the side of the barrel let's call it Smith & Sons and yes I found a wasting fund for this particular purpose let's also have it say something like beer at the top here so we know what's inside I'm going to double click this to add a color overlay and the color I want here is kind of a darker shade of brown something like that and I also want to select our text and add an arc I'll now duplicate the text by hitting ctrl J hit ctrl T in order to be able to rotate it and then drag it down here and it's pretty much all I want to do for my texture if you want to texture that looks more like real wood you can just go in Google search for a wood texture and overlay it on top of the image but I like this minimal style so let's now go file save as we're going to save it again as a PNG and I'm just going to save it on top of our original file it gets to replace I'm going to hit OK and now when we go into blender if it doesn't update right away we go image reload image or hit old R and there we go we can see that our texture is now overlaid on top of our barrel now that's of course a few problems with this I think the texture is way too big and I also put the beard tag on the wrong side so we can very quickly fix that let's just take our to be tags here move them over let's also scale down our font also I probably don't want this to be totally white but somewhere in between again I'm going to save that and in blender hit old R and there we go congratulations on texturing your first object oh and remember to save let's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe so you
