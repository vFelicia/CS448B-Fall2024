hey do you guys know what time it is that's right it's time to have a look at a new unity release unity two thousand eighteen point three is now in public beta and I definitely encourage you to check it out they'll of course be a link to where you can download it in the description also this video is sponsored by unity we've worked together to make sure we cover as much as possible now that's a lot to cover so let's get right to it here's what's new in unity 2000 18.3 so jumping right into it unity now supports isometric to detail maps for those of you who don't know what isometric means it's basically a different way of making perspective an isometric object has all three dimensions drawn at the same length rather than shortening them depending on the position of the observer this is an art style often used for both 3d and 2d games and can now be achieved pretty easily using the tom map system you simply create your art symmetric tiles and start painting with them and the talib renderer is capable of doing Portales sorting which opens up the possibility of having your character walk behind buildings trees or other objects moving on the new and improved prefab workflows will be part of 2018 point 3 I've been trying them out using a preview build and I must say that so far I'm in love with these tools if you're interested in learning how to use the new workflows we've covered them in a separate video which I definitely recommend you check out + unity also has some demos available on their website and this release unity has also added a new tool to their profiler memory profiling as the name suggests this tool makes it a lot easier to understand what's happening with memory in your game the current profiler already shows a summary of all allocations for an asset but the new memory profiler gives the possibility to break down each allocation which greatly helps optimize memory usage in other news unit is upgrading from Nvidia PhysX 3.3 to 3.4 the upgrade speeds up operations such as ray casting shape sweeping and mesh cooking to run up to twice as fast which is a lot it also improves support for detecting collisions with fast rotating objects and adds enhanced determinism also the default scripting run time is now dotnet for X Y net 3.5 runtime has been deprecated and support for it will soon be dropped on top of that projects that are targeting the dotnet 4x scripting runtime we'll also be able to use the opensource ruslan compiler this means that we get access to the latest C sharp seven point two language features and that compilation times will be reduced which is of course always very welcome unity 2018 point three also ships with an update to the terrain system I think the changes to the UI and the tools themselves are fairly minimal some of the painting modes and settings are organized a bit differently however I've heard that bigger changes are coming in version 2000 19.1 also this release does come with some really nice performance improvements as well support for these lightweight and HD render pipelines so definitely a step in the right direction here in terms of the navigation system navmesh is in prefabs can now be baked in isolation from within prefab mode and the navmesh curie raycast method can now be called in jobs if you want to trace a straight path between two positions on the navmesh mm 18.3 also features a number of improvements to the HD render pipeline one of the main ones for me is probably mesh decals which are just really handy and we have a new shader to play around with these stack with shader now I'm in no way a graphics engineer but just from playing around with it it seems very similar to this standard lit shader except it adds a bunch of more advanced rendering features like subsurface scattering and transmission and a wall just makes it more configurable and finally artists now have greater control over reflections and light probes which helps minimize errors in lighting mm 18.3 also comes with some editor improvements Linda now has a unified settings window for project settings and preferences the new window is dark apple and searchable which makes it much more convenient to quickly find and change settings also we now have the ability to close and scroll through open tabs now as always the particle team has a bunch of new features for the shuriken particle system particle lights now support realtime global illumination you can now flip particle measures just like with billboards the particle standard shader has been made default the external forces module has been approved along with the texture sheet animation module and the list goes on a really cool addition is ported mesh shape emission which allows you to create cool effects around meshes like these also the new ring buffer mode makes it easier to create persistent effects like footprints bullet holes by keeping particles alive after their lifetime expires until they're replaced and finally with this new version unity will be expiring the old legacy particle system at this point though I can't imagine anyone being sad about that since the new particle system is better in pretty much every way now this vide simply had way too many features to cover in this video here's the list of some of them finally 2000 18.3 comes with a number of smaller changes and bug fixes for complete overview check out the release notes using the link in the description and as always I encourage you to join the beta and try out the new version after all being part of the beta program is super helpful both for us developers and the unity depths plus you get to try out new and exciting stuff and joining the beta is really easy simply click the link in description to get started on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video is the video over but I still want more screen time the upgrade speeds up operation such as break a sting shape sweeping and meth cooking with suites with sweeping speed tubs with sweeping it's thanks out the awesome patreon supporters who donated in July and a special thanks to Andrew killin n Co are arming a breezy James P Robert burned
