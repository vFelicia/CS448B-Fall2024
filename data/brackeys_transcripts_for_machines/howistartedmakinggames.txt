I've always been fascinated by video games especially the ones without any clear objective my favorite kind was sandbox games because they wouldn't tell you what to do instead you had to come up with ideas on your own and often these games would give a glimpse into what it might feel like to make it game yourself I remember spending hours upon hours in Garry's Mod trying to figure out the intricacies of how the engine worked to this day I still considered one of the greatest games ever made exactly because it wasn't a game it was something more I was always on the lookout for a new sandbox game or mod that I could delve into I went from powder game Gary smart to Warcraft 3 World Editor he has spent months making custom towerdefense maps and just goofing around with the engine but I still wanted to make a game of my own and it's fun as some of these tools were I just wanted something simple that would allow me to do that so I downloaded unity thanks to have the awesome pigeon all right the story is not over unity was still in early stages at this point and no one had really heard about it instead I picked up game maker not game maker studio as you know it back then it was well different game maker was fun but I quickly found myself searching for something more especially because I wanted to experiment with 3d for this reason I started using blender now those of you who've been following this channel for a while probably know that I'm a terrible 3d modeler seriously it's bad so instead of failing at making realistic renders I embarked upon blenders visual scripting solution and actually succeeded in making a few smaller games of course the visuals were made up of cubes but still we all have to start somewhere but something about programming visually didn't feel right this was probably mostly because of how limited blenders no they did it was back then regardless I couldn't get the idea of writing real code out of my head so I experimented with Python Visual Basic and HTML but at this point I didn't really get programming in fact it seemed unnecessarily hard and I always ended up feeling bored by it I wished like many others before me that I could make a game without having to think about programming so I teamed up with some friends we've all beginners back then in fact we were still kids but we had ideas and weren't afraid to try them out together we had a 3d modeler a Java programmer a character artist and then of course me I wanted to be the one that brought it all together and since we decided on using unity there was no other way than to learn how to use it ironically I started by watching YouTube tutorials back then the biggest channel making videos on unity was tornado twins some of you might remember these guys with that help I was able to put together a prototype for a first game awake an ambitious ambience based 3d side scroller with puzzles and platforming mechanics of course to no one's surprise spin complete beginners we might have bit off more than we could chew so having learned nothing from our mistake we moved on to an even bigger project your game inspired by a love for sandbox games we set out to make a game where the players make their own games this time we managed to get the core gameplay working and I was starting to really enjoy scripting finally programming was beginning to make sense for me now I still couldn't write two lines of code without a gazillion errors but hey I still wrote those two lines of code and working on your game is actually also how I got into making tutorials back then we didn't have a marketing budget in fact we didn't have a budget at all so we needed a way to let people know about our game once it got released so I thought what better way to build an audience of people interested in sandbox games than by making tutorials so I started my first series on creating a survival game in unity completely unknowing that my first video ever would have over a million views only a few years later and in truth I had no idea what I was doing back then but I think out of all game developers that's the most common thing learning as you go game development is a bit like jumping into the water before knowing how to swim all you can do is hope that somehow you find a way to float but that's also what makes it so exciting all projects are different and with each one comes to a new set of challenges that are even more complicated than the previous ones it's exciting but it's also easy to lose track sometimes you just have to remind yourself to look back at how far you've come I still remember the thrill of getting the character moving around the screen in fact I still get some of that thrill when I do the same thing now but thankfully the end result is a lot better and in five years I'll probably look back at the games I've made lately and think of a million ways they could be improved I guess we'll just have to wait and see text of the awesome
