hello everyone and welcome to this live stream tutorial in this video we are going to be creating a replica of bomberman inside of unity and it's going to look something like this once we're done so if I go ahead and hit play here we should be able to use our mouse and ignore this error it has something to do with the editor not the game I should be able to use on the mouse here to click and place bombs on different tiles and the bombs will then recognize where it's placed and create an explosion so that it doesn't overlap with the walls that it cannot destroy but it should also go ahead and dynamically destroy the elements that it can destroy so just like in the original Bomberman game and it should be really easy for you to go in and add a character controller here that goes around and places bombs instead of using the mouse because our entire environment is actually set up using the unity town map system so we are basically just modifying that at runtime and as you can see we do have a Collider in here so all of the wall elements and all of the destroyable elements here should have colliders and so right away if you go ahead and place a rigidbody in here in fact we can go ahead and try that but it's just try creating the rigidbody in here at runtime this is probably gonna go wrong but I'm just gonna do it anyway so I'm gonna create a 2d object sprite here and I'm just gonna select some kind of sprite let's just do a bomb whoops everything is not working there we go and we can move up the bomb here which I now called W let's just call it bomb and we place it at the top and we add a Collider to it so we're going to do a circle Collider we should actually be able to see this collide with our environment and this is not tested guys that I hope this will work but we're going to add a 2d rigidbody and there you go as you can see it kind of lands on the floor here and as you can see it kind of falls down and yeah so everything is set to work up with collide work with colliders and if we go ahead and say destroy part of the environment here you can see these colliders get removed okay that example it turned out way better than I thought it would so about that but yeah so let's don't dive right into the tutorial also towards the end we'll do a Q&A so make sure you to watch the video all the way through because we're going to be answering questions at the end like we always do so now we can go file open project because I've actually gone ahead and prepared kind of a starter project the reason why is I wanted to just include all the sprites I'm going to be using to have all the tiles set up appropriately also because I'm using rule tiles and I'm going to show you what this is in a second and I'm going to refer you to a video as well as a place where you can download this started project so don't worry you can learn all about it there's no black magic in this it's just for convenience I've gone ahead and created this project as you can see I already have mine sitting on my computer here but if you want to download it yourself I do have a link for that and for the people watching on YouTube there will of course be a link in the description and to the people watching on twitch I have a link that you can check out in the chat right there and I would ask the admins to go ahead and copy it and have it ready if people ask at a later point because I'm not going to be able to focus on pasting that in different places but yeah there is a link to the started project and this is what the started project looks like as you can see we just have a completely empty scene there's nothing in here other than a main camera but I also have a tile palette set up called Bomberman and if this window isn't open for you you can always go window and select tile palette and that should open it up and in here I've configured a few different tasks and you can see those under the tiles folder right here we have the wall tile that's that one right here just a static tile with a sink single sprite we have the destructible that's that one right here the same thing just a simple tile with a single sprite and then we have the dirt and wall filler and these are more complicated as you can see because these are what we call rule tars this allows these allow us to set up rules for how our tiles should look depending on how we paint with them depending on what tasks are nearby and this allows us to really easily paint goodlooking environments where the tiles correspond to each other I've talked about how to set up tiles and how you can get rule tiles because it's not um included with unity by default and all that stuff and how to use tile Maps in general in a video I just created called tile Maps and unity so if you want to learn more about how to paint with tile maps and set all that stuff up I would definitely recommend you check out that video of course also have a link to that in the description so with that we can actually go out and create a tile map now so in order to create a tile map we go to the hierarchy we rightclick we go to the object and we select tile map and this creates a grid where we can configure the size of the grid as well as a tile map object and as I've explained in the video I did a tile map is basically like a layer in Photoshop so we can go ahead and paint stuff onto a tile map and we can create multiple tile maps and layer them on top of each other if we want to have depth sort of say in our tabs so this tile map we can actually go ahead and paint on two right away we do that by selecting the brush tool here and hitting B we want to select the appropriate palettes here I only have one called the Bomberman which is included in the project and I'm gonna go ahead and select say the dirt here to the left now as you can see this is a rule tile and this means that if I go ahead and paint with it you can see that it automatically chooses a sprite that is appropriate for the position or for the on tile depending on the nearby tiles so that's pretty cool instead of us having to go in and select a corner like this I'd select a filler and all that stuff that you would normally do in order to create kind of corresponding tasks so we'll go ahead and use this to sketch out our level and I'm gonna make this fairly wide here something along these lines and I'm actually just going to make it completely square is this completely square this is not completely square this is completely square I believe there we go I'm going to hit G in order to fill out the entire thing there we go and and click with my mouse and then switch back to be in order to change back to brush mode I'm just going to make sure that the size of this is correct so if we imagine that we have walls all the way round here and we then go ahead and place one two three four wall pieces and then we have another wall so this is the correct size of the level that I want to make then we can select the wall filler this one here and I'm just gonna fill out with this all the way round here I'm actually going to do ain't no other patch add that just so that it isn't completely empty around our level so if we go ahead and look in the game view whoa for some reason our main camera is a bit zoomed in here and it isn't really positioned in a way that I'd like so I'm just going to take the main camera I'm going to move it over here by 0.5 on the X in order to be exact I'm also just going to change the size of the camera here in order to kind of zoom it out and we can also move it down by 0.5 or negative point 5 on the Y here just to Center it on our level and that actually looks pretty decent I'm actually going to zoom it in a bit more something around there um we can definitely go in here and add more wall filler in order to make sure that no matter what screen size we use that we are going to fill everything out with sprites so that it doesn't look weird angle Ichi there we go so now we should see that our level looks just fine and this is kind of the background of a level this is kind of what we want everything else to be painting painted on top of so we can go ahead and select our tile map and rename it to tile map underscore and I'm gonna call this background and because this is a background we are going to set the ordering layer for our talib render 21 so now it's going to be drawn underneath everything else now we can right click on a grid sirico 2d object and select tile map again and we've now created another layer and this one is going to be time app underscore gameplay this is where all avoid gameplay tiles the ones that actually affect our players are going to be and this is of course the destructible environment and the walls so let's start by painting some walls here I'm still I still have the brush selected but do note that you don't need to select the time app in the hierarchy instead you need to go under active tile map and choose the one that you want to paint to so I'm gonna change this to tile map game play select the wall and now I should be able to paint with the wall so I'm gonna go ahead and paint some walls whoops and if you missed and miss click or something you can always hold down shift in order to remove there we go and I'm gonna place in all of the walls inside of our level square here and there we go this now looks like a completely typical Bomberman level cool so now we've actually kind of created the whole base for our game this is how incredibly simple it can be to create levels using this tile map system the next thing that we want to do is make sure that all of our levels are sort or all of the elements in our level are sort of interactable in other words we want to add colliders to each of these wall pieces so that if we go ahead and create say a player character he will be able to collide with them so let's go ahead and hit add component and in here we're going to create a tile map Collider 2d and as you can see this goes ahead and actually creates you can see it out or outlines each one of these elements with a green line and this is of course a Collider you can also see it creates lines between each one of these elements and that's because it's creating a box Collider for each element which is not very performant so instead what we want to do is actually go in here and add another component that will automatically combine all these colliders in an effective way and this is what we call a I've actually forgot forgotten what it's called here let's go into physics 2d and it select the scene here composite Collider yes so the composite Collider 2d and this automatically creates a rigidbody and this doesn't mean that we need our tile map in to move in any way we can simply set the body type to static and now it really is as F or is as if the rigid body wasn't there it's not going to apply any forces or anything it knows this object is not going to move and then we can go to the Tom F Collider and we can hit used by composite and right away you can see all the green lines between the different parts disappear and we now have one uniform line going all the way around for the wall tiles that are next to each other and this is actually happening at runtime so if at runtime we were to change our tile map our composite Collider will change the way that it generates really cool and this also means that we can go ahead and now paint more elements so if we want to paint with the destructive tile here we can actually just go in here and as you can see right away the collider update so I'm just gonna paint a bunch of destructible elements in here so that we can see it working later and it will look really cool and I'm just gonna scatter these throughout this is not really about creating an interesting level as much as it is a demo but there we go we now have some elements in here and as you can see the collider again has updated for all of these one thing that you do need to know about when creating our Collider is for your tile map is that you need to set up what sort of Collider you want each town to have so if we go to our say wall here we can actually change the collider type of our wall and as you can see I've set mine to grid if you select none no colliders are going to be generated for this element and as you can see if I select it now all of the wall elements are ignored by our Collider this is definitely not what we want if you select sprite it's going to generate a Collider based on the sprite so for example for this destroyed wall part here or this destructible part it's actually going to generate a Collider that goes around all the details of the sprite we don't want that we simply want a square Collider and so we choose grid this simply creates a Collider that is completely Square and it's the same size as the grid element and this is what I want for both the wall and the destructible and then for the dirt and the wall filler not that we have are applying any colliders on these elements because they are on the background but I do definitely want to go ahead and simply set those to none I don't want any collision on these elements whatsoever so that's how you can configure it for individual tiles so now that we have set up our environment in the way that we want it's time to start actually doing things through script and the first thing that we want to do is being able to spawn in bombs so let's actually create a bomb to do that we'll go under the sprites here and let's take the bomb that is included in the project and let's drag it right into our scene ash oops something weird happened there created a material game a bit kind of disappeared did it make a tile out of it that was weird I have no idea what just happened do any of you guys it seems that the tile map renderer for some reason took on the material created for the bomb here okay so we are probably just gonna go ahead answer the experts default for that one and everything is back to normal that was very weird I have no idea what happened but instead of dragging it in here we can probably just drag it into the heart yes okay so now I created our bomb and we can see it in our game we also want to make sure that our bomb is always overlaid on top of our gameplay layers so let's go ahead and set the order in layer two one here then we can actually move our element here whoops I'm going to switch into 2d mode here and just that's place it at the center of our scene here this is kind of how it's going to look like or go to look it's this is kind of how it's going to look like when we create a bomb and the main thing that we want to happen for this bomb is that after a little while we of course want it to explode so we're going to have some kind of explosion component on our bomb but let's create that later for now let's just take this bomb and turn it into a prefab so let's create a folder inside of our project for prefabs and let's drag it right in there there we go so now we can remove it from our scene and we can go ahead and create a bomb spawner so let's rightclick in our hierarchy create an empty object and this is where we'll put a bomb spawner let's reset the transform and call it bomb spawner and then we can add component and we're going to create a bomb spawner script of type C sharp and let's say create an ADD and now we can double click this to open it up in Visual Studio and while it's waiting or booting up here I'm just gonna have a look at the chat to see if everything is working looks like it that's awesome and yeah let's just go ahead and continue with the video that so the first thing that we want is because we are going to be working with Tom Maps we're going to be using unity engine dot tar maps you always always want to do this when you want to use tar or work with tar maps in scripting in unity we can however delete the two top namespaces there we're not going to be using those we can also remove the start function we won't be using that either but what we want is a reference to our tile map game play layer the reason why is that we go ahead and create a bomb let's say that we go ahead and unit is lagging out here so let's say that we go ahead and click and want to place a bomb right in the middle here on this tab we don't want the bomb to actually appear right where our mouse clicked that way if we click that in the corner here it would actually overlay some of the other tiles no we want we want it to snap to the center of the town that we clicked on so even though we click in the corner of the tile it should snap right to the center to do this we of course need a reference to a tile map in order to determine where the center of the given tile is so let's create a public tile map and this is going to be our tile map we can just call it bad we're also going to want a public game object which is going to be of course a reference to our bomb prefab what we want to actually spawn then inside of our update mode let's check if we get a mouse button down so if we get a mouse button press to do that we use input dot get mouse button down and the mouse button that we want to check for is just the left mouse button which is index of zero so if we press our left mouse button well um actually I just need to rearrange something on my other screen here one second okay cool so um if we press our mouse button we want to go ahead and first of all get the position that we pressed so we can use camera dot Maine dot screen to world point in order to convert input dot mouse position into world coordinates so input that Mouse position gives us the position of our mouse in screen coordinates which is the amount of pixels on the X and the y from the I think it's upper right upper left corner but it could be lower left corner but I'm pretty sure its upper left corner and we convert that into a well position by using this function then we can store this position as a vector three so we'll create a vector three call it world position and set it equal to that then we want to go ahead and take this world position and couldn't into a cell in other words what tile and we referred to a tile on a grid as a cell so what cell did we press well to do that we used another handy function called tile map dot world to sell this takes just in our ordinary world position and converts it to a cell position and a cell position is actually also stored oops my phone going off now a cell physician is actually also stored as a vector3 but not a normal vector three so we can go ahead and write back the three here and call it sale and set it equal to our map dot world to sell but the cell here is can actually okay can be stored in a vector three but what we normally use here is a vector three int and the reason why is that cells or cell numbers are always referred to in whole numbers in integers we cannot have a half cell so this using this data type here is simply faster it's simply easier to store because we don't need to store decimal places for each of the three numbers they all integers that's the only difference here and finally we need to get the center position of the cell so now we've determined on our grid here on our grid that we have which cell on this grid did we press and now we need to find say we press the center here now we need to find the center position of this cell and to do that we simply need to go tile map dot get cell center world and here we input again a position of the cell so this cell here and this is going to again be a vector3 and for this we of course want to have decimal places so it's going to be a normal vector three and we'll call this the cell center position all right so now we've chewed through kind of all the calculations that we need to do first converting from our screen space which is where our mouse position is to a world position that's what we do here then converting from a well position to a cell defining the right cell then converting from the cell to the center well position of that cell and finally we can go ahead and instantiate our bond so we can instantiate a bond prefab add these cells Center position with no rotation so catonian dot identity and if we now say this and go into unity and hit play we should see that we have no errors fingers crossed okay so I clicked play twice so it actually unplayed but now if I click OK I know that we're gonna get an error now because we didn't actually refer it to the bomb prefab so there we go but it is working I promise you so we can go back into a bond spawner we need to reference first of all our tile map which is going to be Tama up gameplay and then under prefabs we're going to reference or bomb prefab there we go and if we now it play I am try and place a bomb yes so you can see no matter where I press on some of these tiles a bomb is actually going to be pressed of course it doesn't explode yet but that is kind of an introduction to working with some of these positions when it comes to toss how do you place game objects on tiles how do you kind of refactor some of these positional data so yeah that I think that was a pretty important thing to learn when working with on tile Maps you will also note that we can place bombs on pretty much all tiles in our entire tile map so we're not really doing any checking to see if the place is bomb compatible and you could definitely do that but I don't think it's important here because the only thing that's going to be placing bombs is your character and he's never going to be able to move to these locations so yeah you might do that if you want to go all in but I don't think it's necessarily something you need to do cool so now that we are placing bombs in the right positions it's time to go ahead and make these bombs explode and of course in order to make them explode we need to have some kind of a countdown timer but right before we create that I'm just going have a look in the chat here and see if I'm still streaming or if I'm just talking to myself okay so things things are going good awesome the next thing that we will do is create a bomb script so we'll go to our prefabs bomb and we'll create another component here and this is going to be the bomb script oops bomb and will it create an ad and we'll double click it to open it up in Visual Studio and this is definitely going to be this simplest script that we'll be riding today the only thing that we want to do is replace the start method with some kind of public float which we'll call our countdown and will default this to say two seconds then inside our update method so every frame we want to go ahead and reduce our countdown by time.deltatime in other words each second we're going to reduce a countdown variable by one and so this is going to count down for two seconds and we can go ahead and check if countdown gues reaches zero or goes below zero well then we actually want to go ahead and explode but before we do that we actually need some way of having the bomb explode so right now let's just write a debugger lock saying boom as well as a destroy call oops I did not improve the correct symbol there as well as a destroy hold that is going to remove this game object so right after we say boom in the console we're going to destroy the bomb game object and it's going to be no more cool so let's say that and let's make sure that it's applied to a prefab and everything and that we get no errors yes and then we can hit play and now we should be able to see that if I click wait two seconds it says boom and the bomb is gone perfect so now we have the kind of timing of the bombs are perfected and the only thing left really now is creating the actual map destroy a script and I'm just gonna go ahead and place this on the grid but you can really place it anywhere that you'd like let's call it map destroyer destroy your and let's say create an ad and it's doubleclick it to open it up and this is going to be a bit longer this script but it's not necessarily going to be more complicated than what we've already done so the first thing that we want to do is get rid of both of functions we're not going to be using any of the default unity functions we'll also go ahead and use unity engine you guessed it dart tar maps and finally we're going to get a reference a public tile map to a tunnel and we can just go ahead and call that town map as well because we are going to be modifying our gameplay tile map so we need a reference to our gameplay tile map and now we need a couple of functions let's create a public void which we'll call explode and this is going to take in a vector two with the position where we want to explode and this is going to be a position in world coordinates so we could also just call this world pause just to be a tiny more tiny bit more specific that's probably a good idea and the first thing that we want to go and do is convert this world position that gets inputted into this function into a cell the cell of the origin of the explosion so we'll create so we'll use tile map dot world to sell in order to find the right cell will input the world position that was passed in and we'll go ahead and store this as again a vector3 int called the origin cell which just looks or sounds so incredibly cold origins cell it sounds like something taken right out of the matrix we've achieved the origin cell and we're ready to proceed all right okay that's probably the most nerdiest thing I've said today but it will continue so with this origin cell we need to go ahead and of course explode the cell that the bomb is on but we also want to explode the I'm gonna go ahead and show you this we of course going to explode the cell that the bomb gets placed on but we also want to explode the two cells above this bomb the two cells to the right of this bomb two to the two down and two to the left so let's create a function for exploding a particular cell and then simply call that function with a tiny bit of offset from the origin cell so one one offset on the X to offset on the x one offset on the y to offset on the Y and so on so let's go ahead and create a public another function in here this doesn't need to be public we can just call it make it of a void private void call it explode cell and this is of course going to take in the cell that we want to explore it so a vector3 int called sale and here we go ahead and explode your appropriate cell and the way that we want to do this is first to convert this position or this cell number into an actual top so we need to figure out the data of the cell that this that we're trying to explode so to 'try to achieve the town with a certain cell index what we do is use tom ab get tau and here we feed it simply the cell so simply the position of the top we also need to make sure to convert this because by default this is going to give us what is called a table base so this is going to give us a tall base and a table base is basically just the class that all tile types derive from so by default right now unity just comes with a single tile that derived from tower base and that's just called tau it's the basic table it has the stride a collider that's pretty much it and you can place it in your tile map but I think with time unity is going to be adding multiple kinds of tasks such as ruler tiles which I've included in this project here and you can get from from a github repository that unity has made animated tasks terrain tiles all that kind of stuff as well as you can also create your own tiles that derive from tile base so that's all good but Todd base doesn't actually give us a lot of information about the tile in fact the only thing that it gives us is kind of just a name and the ability to get some more data but that's all very complicated instead what we want to do is actually retrieve the top so we want to be more specific and say hey we just we don't just want to get any tile deriving from tile base we want to only get a top as in the tile that we've gone ahead and created here the destructible and wall this is not gonna work for rule tile because rule tiles are also derived from tile base but their rule tiles not just tasks I know this is very confusing but we want to get the destructible and wall tiles and so we want to be specific that we want to get a tower and so we can actually specify that right here we want to get a tile of the type tile and if you wanted to get a rule tile you can get a ton of the tithe rule tile so this is where you specify what you want to get so we want to get a towel and we'll call it tile and it's going to be of type tile tile tile tile so now that we've gotten the towel at the right position what we want to do is do some checking on this we want to check is this a wall tile in which case we want to stop the explosion right there is this a destructible tile in which case we want to go ahead and well destroy it and we can even check if the towel simply doesn't exist so in order to do that what we want to do is simply go up here and create a few references we want to create a reference to the destructible tile as well as the wall tile so that we can compare the tile that we want to explode to those two and check if they're the same so here we can create a public towel and we'll call this all tile as well as a public tile that will call destructible tile and then down here we can simply check if the town that we're looking at so if tile is equal to wall tile well then we don't want to do anything because we cannot destroy walls so we simply going to return out of the function we also check if the tile is equal to a destructible tile in which case we are going to go ahead and actually change the tile to remove or in actually we're not just going to change it we're going to remove the top I'm going to show you how to do that in a second then finally if it's not a wall tile but if it's a destructible tile or there is no tile well then we want to go ahead and create an explosion on the top and then we can simply empty function so this is how we would kind of construct it this is how we can get a towel and find out what tile we're working with and in the case that we want to destroy the tile what we do is using tile map dot set tile and this is pretty much the equivalent of the function up here here we get a towel at the certain position here we set a towel at a certain position at first we give it the position so cell and then we give it the new tile that we wanted to be so here we could set it to a wall tile if we wanted to we could set it to a destructible tile any other tile if you reference it or we could simply set it to null in order to remove it and that's what we want to do here so if we say this we should actually be able to call this function and let's actually just try and do that so for now we can maybe just call it on the origin cell so up here we can say explode cell and we just want to explode our origin cell if we now save this and and we select our grid and under our map destroyer we should get to three fields here the first one is we need to reference our town map gameplay the second is we want a reference to a wall tile as well as the destructible tile and if we now play we should see that if I place a palm here right on top of some dirt it should remove that dirt don't know why it didn't remove that dirt oh because we also need to of course call this function I'm being stupid so we actually also need to go into our bomb and instead of just debug dead logging boom we need to call this explode function and for now we can just use find object of type map destroyer in order to get a reference to this script and then simply use dot explode and then we'll give it our current position so transform dot position of course I would recommend you to use a singleton here instead I've shown you how to create very simple singleton patterns before if you want to know more about what Singleton's are I love also have a link for that in the description if you're watching on YouTube but it's basically just a more efficient way of getting a reference to a script that is only that only exists once inside the scene and it's a very complicated sentence but basically it just is more performant than this line of code right here so I would recommend you add that but this is not what the video is about so we're just going to do it this way and find the object each time so now we called explode on the map destroyer every time our bomb is ready to explode if we save that and hit play we should now be able to do this thing that I was trying to do before which is place a bomb on top of some destructible piece of environment and it should remove it if we pray place it on some dirt nothing happens and if we place it on a wall nothing happens so it only destroys destructible tiles that's because inside of our function in the map Destroyer it checks if the tile is distractible town and if it is it removes it so it says something about this working let's also go ahead and create an explosion each time just to make this more visible and it I think it's going to help us when we try and explode more cells so to create an explosion we really just need a reference to a prefab that we can spawn in and we can go ahead and create that here so we'll create a public game object and we'll call it explosion prefab and then down here when we want to create the explosion we first want to change the cell here to a world position so we can use Tom app dot cell to world and we'll give it our cell here and then we can we actually also need to offset this a little bit and before we use this let me find it here this gets tells Center world and I think we need to use that also here actually instead so let's use dot get cell Center world yes yes this is what we need to use and here we simply input this cell cool that's the right function because this will get the center of the cell and this is where we want to instantiate our explosion so this is going to be a victor three that will called position what's that equal to the result there and then we can instantiate an explosion prefab add the position with no rotation so quaternion identity let's save that go into unity select our grid wait for it to refresh here there we go now we can drag in a prefab but of course we need to create this explosion prefab and I've gone ahead and imported some sprites for the explosion here as well by the way all these sprites here the dirt explosion and mold are also included in some of the unity example scene so they are created by unity so in here we can go to the sprite editor and as you can see it's automatically laid out all the individuals rights for this explosion so whoops and if we close this right editor we can see each of them here and in order to make an animation out of these we simply need to select all them by holding down shift and drag them into our hierarchy and this is going to prompt us to create an animation let's create a new folder for this which we'll call animation and let's call it the explosion animation let's save and now it creates this explosion on this course zero object we're simply going to rename this to explosion there we go and if we go into the animation window we can go window and image animation there we go we can now scrub through and see the animation asset place and we can just hit play here if you want to preview it in real time so now we have an animation I just want to make sure that at the end here we add a final key frame that gets rid of the smoke so that when it plays all the way through it disappears so I'm just gonna hit record here go place it right at the end of our animation and go ahead and set the sprite to none and so now it should insert so that if we play through the animation and it ends here there we go it's gone and finally we can go under the animation here and select the clip explosion on our arm there we go explosion and we want to disable loop time so now our animation won't loop it will just play once and then it won't be visible anymore so now we have our explosion and we can actually go out and make a prefab out of this as well and we can remove it from our scene and now if we go under our grid and drag in our explosion prefab that we just created hit play and place it place a bomb somewhere in our scene we should see there we go we now have an explosion effect and of course it's currently only right on top of the bomb but we can simply go ahead and call the same explode so function just like we do and then simply offset it to the up to the right to the left and down in order to create more explosions of the same kind and we can do this really easily but first I just want to have a look at the chat here to see how everyone is doing looks good I hope I hope you guys are able to to follow along I know this down video is kind of all over the place right now but the Talmud system is all new and interesting and I thought I would cover it as much as possible really don't mind it if if you aren't able to follow along with with everything you'll learn with time this is really just an introduction but yeah it looks like everything is good in the chat so we can go ahead and continue and so I wanted to go ahead and call the explode cell here and then simply offset it to go up and to the right and down and to the left and to do this we can simply copy this experts a call and then simply add a tiny offset on to our origin cell position so we'll do plus new vector3 int and here we can then offset it on the x y&z so and of course first we want to go ahead and offset it by 1 on the X 0 on the Y and 0 on the Z and we can go ahead and copy this a bunch of times so then we want to go to on the X then we want to go 0 on the X and 1 on the y then we want to go 0 on the X and 2 on the Y and you're kind of getting the system here however we don't want to offset it on the Z because we're not really working with depth in that way instead what we want to do is offset it by negative 1 and negative 2 on the X and then do the same thing on the Y here so negative 1 on the Y and negative 2 on the Y in other words plus 1 plus 1 on the Y plus 1 plus 2 on the X negative 1 negative 2 on the Y negative 2 1 negative 2 on the X so that's how we are getting this pattern and we should now see actually that if we just say this and go in and play and place a bomb it should work right off the bat so if we place a bomb here now we get this lovely explosion effect it removes the part of the environment that we want whoops I shouldn't place it on top of that but you can see it working the only problem with this is that if we place it somewhere where it should actually be blocked by a wall say here you can see that the explosion doesn't actually trigger on the wall but it goes through to the other side and this is of course not something we want you want walls to be able to accept like an explosion so how do we do that well we can actually do it fairly simply we can do it by using a return type to this function in other words instead of returning nothing we'll go ahead and return a ball and this pool is going to indicate it's going to indicate whether or not on the explosion was blocked by a wall so in the case that we hit a wall tile we're going to return false because the explosion didn't happen here and so we don't want it to continue in the case that we didn't in other words we reach this point in the code we're going to return true because the explosion did happen and we didn't hit a wall and so we want the explosion to continue so this pool here is just do we want to continue our explosion in the given direction and we can then use that up here so this actually gives a ball now we can use collect it in or we can store it as a pool variable called should continue and set it equal like that and then we can use an if statement but we don't actually need to store each one of them in a variable instead we can simply do a if statement and then wrap the explosion in that and I know it looks kind of confusing but this actually does the same thing so right here we are calling the load cell and we're saying that if it returns true well then we want to go ahead and explode the next cell in the same direction and we want to go ahead and do that for each given direction so if explode cell on the Y here it's true well then we want to explode this second cell on the Y and we just go through and do this for each one of them so if whoops don't want to manually write this when you can do that if explode cell on negative x here we'll want to explode the second one and if explode cell on the first negative Y well then we want to explode this second cell on the negative Y there we go and that should actually do all of the appropriate checking for us of course you could use Ray casts and colliders and complicate yourself in all kinds of ways but this does the exact same thing and sometimes this is what you have to do if you're used to working with unity and kind of thinking about these problems in an abstract threedimensional ways such as we need to determine if something is blocking this explosion we send out a ray to determine this much of this stuff can be avoided if you just take a step back and look at the problem and say well everything is on a grid and that just simply simplifies so many things so here we got away by using not using ray casts and simply writing out of some of this code and it's actually very effective because we're only returning a boolean here so it shouldn't really cost too much performancewise yeah as you can see I'm pretty satisfied with this piece of course so let's go ahead and hit play and now we should see that if we place it say here it should get blocked here and indeed it does if we place it between two walls the explosion doesn't go through and that's actually the end of what I wanted to show you we can now place bombs all over the place and they should interact appropriately you can also see that the bomb right now doesn't trigger if an explosion hits it you can have some bombs trigger other bombs it's that if that something you want we can also just change the order so it doesn't look bad as it does right now so in here the palm county has an ordering layer of one let's go ahead and set the explosions over in the year two three so now the explosion overlays all of the objects and we should see that if we placed two bombs next to each other it looks a bit better when they explode so yeah that's just a tiny fix really from here it's up to you to go ahead and add some kind of character controller and you can you make him rigidbody enabled because everything is set up to work with colliders it's about adding powerups we have a video on YouTube that we did recently on creating powerups for games so if that's something you want to add to your game definitely check out that video and if you have any more questions about tile maps I also did a video specifically on creating and modifying tar maps unity and creating your own custom tiles importing tile sets so if you want to use your own sprites and not my example project here definitely check out that video as well so I think that's pretty much all the video shoutouts that I could think of right now and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video I think it was a pretty exciting little project to make and it's something that I've been wanting to do ever since I heard unity was working on a tile map system I thought Bomberman this will be the bomb no pun intended so um cool yeah that's pretty much the end of the road for the tutorial I think we are ready to go to the Q&A so hello everyone in chat I am all ready to do more talking luckily I've got some water with me and at this point you are or completely free la can't talk anymore feel free at this point to ask questions I will do my best to answer them anything at all try and avoid duplicate questions twine about try and avoid ants spamming them in fact don't spam at all but yeah just ask away I'm here cool so I'm gonna take it to the water and all of you guys have some questions for me they can be technical nontechnical personal why are you using Victor 3 and instead of Victor int that's a good question the reason why is that inside of the art or using the time app API things actually come back with the C position as well and I think this has to do with ordering for different tasks on the same layer I think you are able to do something along those lines I'm not completely sure but for some reason it does return a vector3 and with the Z position in our example everything is at zero so I'm sure that you could use vector to end and it would automatically convert it to that just didn't see a reason how should I start at learning low poly modeling in blender well actually do have a tutorial series on creating a low poly model that is came ready in blender so you can check that out but really it's just about start starting to create some of these things just downloading blender open it up being complete idiot and don't know where anything is and just take it from there it's about practice really but there are some really good blender tutorials online not only this series that I did hey Braga's do have some good links about the API of unity networking sorry not off the top of my head know what is your call and using interfaces in a unity game I use them for some of my games I think interfaces for me is for I should wear this differently I normally only use interfaces very rarely and the reason why is that when I make a game most of the time it's smaller projects and it's game jam projects or tutorial projects and in those it's not often that I need the functionality of interfaces because most of what interfaces are used for our writing solid code especially if you have a large code base or if you're working multiple people on a project often doesn't make sense if you're trying to do something as quickly as possible and so I don't often use them but they can be really really useful they can also be a trap so they're great if you know what you're doing would you like to create a video tutorial on photon multiplayer maybe at some point I heard photon is great are you going to make a chess game in the next live stream because I think it's an easy thing to make chess could be fun I've never thought of it as easy but I guess with this time app system it wouldn't be that hard that's actually a very good idea I will write it down no promises but I'll write it out do you make an Android tutorial I try not to make platformspecific tutorials too much do publish games I don't publish finished games no I do create smaller projects for tutorials and game jams if you want to check out my games you can go to the aloo Matar a website or just search for brekkie student diary and they should appear how about footprint tutorial that could definitely be exciting creating some kind of custom shader for that could be fun they're going to make some Android tutor again same thing as before can you make a bazooka to talk Wow bazookas could be cool I really want to do that I don't think I think it's a bit too close to something I've done before I've created a tutorial on creating grenades in unity that actually destroys part of the environment so I think you could check that out and then simply instead of having a grenade model just have a missile model that just threw a shoot through the level with some particles and something I've pretty much the same thing do you have any idea to do tutorials on an openworld game no that is simply too complex and requires way too much asset creation will you do some tutorials and databases if I was better at databases I probably would however I mean anything can they depends on if you mean local and network databases anything networked is something I suck at local database is there a bunch of stuff that you can do there with JSON and XML or scriptable objects I will have a tutorial on scriptable objects that I suggest to check out if you want to create a local database or just easy way of storing or creating data objects in unity you can check out my scribble objects video but networks probably not right now can you do some advanced 2d tutorials I don't know about you guys but I thought this was fairly advanced I know that there's a lot more that you can do with the Tal map system but it's probably just because I've never used it before but I was researching this and I was confused at some points mostly with the relationship between tiles and and how you're supposed to go about everything but yeah but I would love to do some more advanced stuff at some point do you have any idea to make basic copy protection for unity games nope sorry why gravity not working with animated component if you're over I don't know this this completely depends on the setup of your project but if you are overriding positions of a game object then physics aren't going to work you can physics enable your animation so that physics get applied on top of your animations you shouldn't be modifying the brute position of your object anyways through animation that is my answer can you do a 2d tutorial in the style of Castle Crashers don't starve slash don't starve where there is some depth not completely sure what you mean but those games are awesome and I could maybe do something along those lines yeah what is the best way to make in this run and spawned objects pose yes object pools are basically made for endless runners they are the best example of where you could use object pools so definitely check out my new video on object pooling yay and if you want to learn about some of the other stuff on creating it this runner check out the how to making video game series which shows that can you test our games we actually talking about doing a livestream earlier today after Ludum dare a where I play your games an entire livestream reserved for Christians and answers and just having fun and playing some of the games that you guys create that is something that I really want to do so I'll try to make Ori to set that up only if you guys want to see it if you let me know actually right now is that something you would like to see where we just take some time an hour or so where we sit down and chill and you guys send me some of the games that you make and I can maybe give some feedback and try them out and suck at them live and embarrass myself go cry in the corner now that I think about it it sounds great do you want to create a shaded tutorial series yes especially with the new shader graph I've never been a technical artist per se and so my shader writing knowledge is limited and you know some stuff but not all of it definitely and I would love to cover the new shader graph because they're going to I think it's going to be pretty much the standard standard of how people are going to make be making shaders in unity soon yeah I don't see a lot of people scripting their own shaders with this new tall vegetation and realistic environment on unity and that's something that could be really interested doing something some of this photogrammetry stuff in unity showing off stuff like mega scans or doing a video one on PBR and and some of those rendering techniques but a lot of this stuff is happening to unity right now especially with the scriptable render pipeline so I wouldn't want to go too much into detail before we know kind of how it's RP is going to turn out and how the new graphics workflow and unity is going to be things are still kind of unknown because things are in early beta and so um do you have any recommendations for someone someone wanting to study in Denmark coming from Portugal recommendations yeah I think what I would probably do is is try and go to people in order to make friends because we Danes we tend to kind of not be too good at being the ones that has the incentive to you know actually go and talk to people we tend to kind of shield ourselves and only talk to the ones that we know I know when you talk to ourselves if we are weird like I am and then but but really most people if you just come and talk to them they enjoy it we do enjoy it we just don't do it I don't know why so that would probably be the main thing is just go and talk to people that way you're going to have friends because otherwise yeah and go to social events try and find some mom some circles of people that you think could be likeminded I think that's probably the main thing moving to another country is try and build a network what do you recommend for learning more about shaders right now there are of course a bunch of good resources for shader writing I would mostly recommend stuff like cat like so cat like coding Ellen's Taccone and making stuff look good on YouTube there was some I three can you make us a turtle for survival games I already have a huge series on creating a survival game in unity guys come on it's like 35 videos long or something but and I'm not gonna touch it anymore I'm sorry it's it's too old it's outdated and I think it's more exciting to do different kind of projects you can go watch that to get some inspiration at least I'm sorry that it's old and in JavaScript but yeah but really a survival game is in much way in many ways the same as kind of it kind of a mix between a firstperson shooter and an RPG so you can check out my multiplayer first tutorial and my RPG tutorial and try and combine the two in a way that sex that would probably be my recommendation what games to play yourself I play a lot of games I don't have time to play them but I try and play a lot of games this is what I should say so right now or for a long time now my big passion has been csgo Counter Strike global Offensive it's just so fun and I often I'm kind of a social game and most of the time when I play it with friends and it's such a fun competitive game so we play that a lot historically I've played a huge amount of World of Warcraft what if I was able to take all the hours that I put into World of Warcraft and put them into a actually useful skill I would be the world's best guitarist but yeah those are two that I've spent a lot of time on but I also try and play smaller games I just replayed a super meatboy which was really fun I haven't played that for a very long time and recently I played all the way through Ori and the blind forest which is such a good game I couldn't recommend it enough and I'm looking so much forward to full of the wisps on this the second one and also I just picked up the new Dragon Ball game fighter is with the Z that's that's really really fun actually it's it's the best one in a while I think and I really love the way that they've shifted to kind of a locked 2.5 T perspective much in the same way that the old fighting games like Street Fighter work because I thought before the 3d element didn't really work for me I liked it to be kind of simple and it is now and it's just yeah incredibly fun and competitive so check that out which one is better pixel art or low poly 3d completely depends on the game that's the pretty much all there is to say are there going to be any more blender tutorials if you guys want them is there something similar to C++ custom header files in unity csharp No can you make a video about game optimization some best practices that would be really fun and it's something that I've had on my list for a long time it's something yeah yeah I would love to do like top five performance or optimization tips and unity and just delve into some different things that normally can be can be apply or some techniques that can normally be applied to most projects in order to make them run better that would definitely be fun one of the big ones is of course object pooling that I just covered in a separate video but also just kind of naming some of these things yeah I would love to do that why don't you apply for a job at unity because I don't really want to work at unity not that it doesn't seem like a great place to work but because I really want to keep doing this and this is really fun and I like the independence so being able to do this at home with some awesome people like Sophie and Thomas is it's really just the biggest gift so yeah why not use a for loop for the explosions in the bomberman tutorial I don't that's probably some way to do that but I don't really see it being simpler because we have to offset them in different ways yeah yeah I know so those of you guys talking about a discord server there is an unofficial discord created by some guys from the forum that is really awesome and we are talking about kind of promoting it some more so if you guys want to hang out and do some realtime chat with the game development community definitely go there I'm sure that the awesome admins will put a link in the chat right now that would be great just yeah a lot of awesome developers there all right so I think they're going to be wrapping up questions now because my throat is getting sore and I do have more stuff to do on today unfortunately work awaits but yeah so final questions and we'll go and wrap this up so do you have a team development or do you do it solo we are three people I of course do all the recording stuff as you can see but we also have Thomas and which is our main video editor he does most are close to all of our video editing and he's become really really good at it I hope you guys recognize that as well the videos require way more editing now especially the ones that are prescripted with broll and everything so he pretty much does all that and then we have Sophia which does all the video planning she's also used to do a bunch of editing and has been doing that for very long time now but yes she does all the planning she sets up sponsorship deals stuff like that I don't know if you guys have noticed it but we have been having a few sponsors lately and she's able to fund find really good one once it's always tech related we had some sponsorships with with udemy with unity with Skillshare and yeah more coming so that's really awesome and and yes it just kind of you know makes Thomas and I follow the schedule so everything with you know crumble and and yes um sometimes they also soufiane Thomas also held in in scripting videos so yeah we have three people at at the moment and which is really fun because doing something alone is fun doing it with friends even more fun can you do a website game tutorial maybe at some point can you make a tutorial an RTS game with a simple I I've talked about RTS before it's too complicated I do want to go ahead and create some kind of RTS related videos because some of the things are interesting but creating an entire RTS game is way too complicated for a Totoro series turnbased castle game that sounds really fun have you ever thought of doing a 2d topdown shooter I have done one it was fun it's called waving coming it's on my github so if you want to check it out it's there I hate spamming please tell me how to market games free and paid I actually have no idea my way of marketing my game when I was making games and thought it that I wanted to be a game developer was creating a YouTube channel and doing tutorials so I don't the the tutorial part turned out pretty well the game part not so much so and now I'm here so I wouldn't really know too much about that but it's really about figuring out where is your audience and trying to tap into those to the streams available for that audience so in my case I thought my audience because my game was about making games thought would be game developers and so I thought I would try and tap into unity users and with the turtles so that's kind of how I got rolling so that's my thought process at least why Facebook post Twitter but not Instagram because I just don't use Instagram I don't know how it works I've never used it it's good did you create any games with mechanics like in these sim series not really can you make a meditation tutorial and unity yes that would be fun will you make it to turn on mobile game controls I try not to do too much platform specific stuff but maybe mobile game controls could be fun there are a lot of great also free assets for that can you make an advanced 2d platformer character controller not right now it's not on the roadmap they're a bunch of stuff in the asset store check that out do you plan to do a video about the new coop job system and entities components they seem to be awesome if I'm able to figure them out if they when they come out yes otherwise I might just leave that to your Kim so yeah okay can you make a tutorial to create portal I have a portal 2 tutorial on the YouTube I'm creating this called portal effect not the entire game but I'm sure you can figure something out based on that slowstar send realtime displacement tutorial that sounds fun a lot of graphic stuff guys I would love to do some more graphic stuff especially with the new shader editor and I think we are going to close it here alright questions are up we are closing it it's a wrap guys no more Christian being answered yes my voice is getting sore it's too much cold ah that's pretty much it that was the live stream guys hope you enjoyed it um all of that I just want to say thank you so much for supporting guys you guys are awesome if you want to see more live streams like this if you want to see more videos if you want to just see more from us in general the best place to go is to patreon.com/scishow and make it another donation there it's reoccurring so every month it's you're going to donate some amount you choose the amount and you can cancel it whenever you want it's a great way to also become a part of the patreon community which is awesome and and to make sure that we keep making this stuff that we're making right now especially now that we are multiple people it means that we can bump up the bump turn out a lot more content and that it's a lot more well edited and produced but it also means that of course we have multiple mouths to feed so thanks to all the guys who are supporting on patreon I'm just gonna give you a link in the chat here of patreon.com slash Breck ease if you guys want to go there at least check it out on that thanks to all the awesome supporters patreon supporters or not you guys Rock and I hope you guys enjoyed the team I had a lot of fun I really like this one so yeah I'll see you guys in the next video bye guys bye everyone
