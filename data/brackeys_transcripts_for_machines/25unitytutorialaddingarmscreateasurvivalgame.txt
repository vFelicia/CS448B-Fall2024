hello everyone never comes to tutorial number 25 in our survival game series Tampa Black Keys I am the CEO of Black Keys and in this video we are gonna take a look at importing the arms for our game I am included some in our survival assets pack which we are going to take a look at in a sec this video is just gonna be about the basic importing and setting things up and then in later videos we're gonna focus on scripting the animation to work with our game and we're gonna do this using the built in unity mecha name system which was introduced in unity 4 okay so let's get started so if you want to use the arms I have made or I've made a part of but we'll talk about that in a sec then you can download the survival assets from our website and if you don't know how to do that then you can of course go ahead and watch our bonus video explaining just that so when you have important and extracted them you should be left with this folder and if we open it up we can go under imports then arms and here you can see a few files I've included both the blender file and an FBX file I recommend you use the FBX file for importing into unity but it's really up to you what you want to use also the texture which is of course UV unwrap so it looked really real here I've included that in both a JPEG format for just importing into unity but also a Photoshop format if you want to create different versions of the texture so you can have a guy with gloves you can have a cloud guy with no gloves you can have darker skin color a wider skin color and so on and then I have a credit text document because I actually didn't create the model for this or the RIC those two things along with one of the animations were made by EAF and you can check them out here and also I have a link to the license that including how you can use this but really all there is to it is that you can use it commercially but you have to credit the author so you have to say that this was made partially by EI FG don't need to mention me at any point but feel free to do so if you want to cool so now we have that out of the way let's go ahead and import this into unity so I have kind of made a I've kind of set up a scene to show you what it is we're going to be creating in the next videos however many that might be so let me just load up that scene and you can see we have the the arms holding a sword and if I go ahead and play the game let's take a look at what we've got so we have some punch animations and it is completely random which one it plays then we have the ability to switch between different weapons so we can switch to this one and then the hands will actually hold the weapon and it will follow us around and now if we attack it plays different swing animations and this can be used with a variety of different weapons we also have some new weapons coming soon so we don't have to use these quite ugly ones I made a back in the day so that's basically what we're going to be making now let's open up our original scene here so you're back to normal and let me just go ahead and explain what it is we are gonna be doing with this painting so again excuse my amazing drawing skills um but but this is basically how every thing works together in unity when it comes to animation and that's what it's really about so we have our play and parented to our play we have our main camera and this this you can see if we open up our play we have the main camera under our main camera we currently have the melee this is something we're gonna attach to a game object in in our arms which have made specifically for this so that we can just parent a weapon to that and then it will follow the animation but that's something we're gonna look at in a second I haven't included it in our painting yet but basically we have the main camera and parented to that we're gonna have the arms so they will follow us around no matter what we do on the arms we have a component called an animator and this animator is what helps us this is what makes the engine include mecanim on the animator we have two things we have an avatar which is which defines how the rig is set up so which bones and which bones are what so basically if we have a hand bone the avatar will help units you figure out that that is a hand and and so if we were using a complete humanoid character so a full character we could also read target animation but that's a bit more advanced then attached to the animator we're gonna have a animated controller and this is what we're gonna use to play animations and blend between them so we are gonna do a little bit of scripting but really most of it is done using the controller so this is just a quick preview of how a controller might look and that's again something we're going to cover later so I won't go into that great so let's import the arms so hit the project pane hit create and then folder and let's call this arms original and then double click that to open it and now we can just drag in the FBX file along with the arms to fuse there you go and this might take a little while sand since it is pretty advanced geometry it is game really still there so now we have the arms five here and you could go ahead and rename that if you want but I'll just leave it if we decide to make new versions in the future and we have our arms diffuse texture the diffuse texture is fine as is so we're not going to play around with that though our arms five we want to change some settings so if we just drag them into a scene you can have a look at how they are now and they are really tiny they are really really tiny so let's go and select them in the project pane and then change up the scale factor let's try 0.4 and this is really just something you have to play around with whenever it comes to animated and rect objects I don't like changing the scale inside of unity I really like only changing the scale factor that looks much better actually um we can go ahead and adjust that once we get him in the view so we'll just leave that for now maybe they need to be a bit bigger no that's fine okay so mesh compression we want that off normal tangents that is import calculate and the material sure we can do that under the rig this is pretty important we won't set this as generic and the root note should be the arm Armagh tree and then master so this one and this will just help unity solve out the animations and help it fade better so that's really important you choose that if you made the rake yourself I'm pretty sure you know what what to pick so let's hit apply on that and it will re importance once again there we go so now we can actually see it is in kind of a battle stands there so that means that the animation is working because this doesn't look all kinds of weird normally you are not in doubt when something is not working so let's hit the enemy and if you don't know what bone it is really just play around with it you can't do anything wrong let's go under the animations tab now so we want to of course import animation and you can just leave these compression and position errors and such as is so the default take I see that's just an idle but not really an idle we want we want the normal idle here and the Iowa with reppin so we can go ahead and exclu exclude this default take it might not be in the blend file actually but let's just exclude it from here so select it and then hit the minus sign so now it know it's gone and all these settings are basically used for defining whether or not an animation should loop and also saying what kind of Clips we have so if you made these animations yourself and didn't create separate actions for them that's what they're called in blender then you might have to go in and define what start and end frame the animations have and that's really just about selecting them and dragging around with these sliders and such okay so let's just preview the different animations so you can see down here we have a preview so I'll just drag that up a bit and drag it out so that looks good and we can change the preview speed up here so let's just make that one and let's have a look at the idle that looks very fine pretty subtle and soon we should start seeing the fingers animating a bit there so that looks good then we have the Idol with with weapon now our hands are closed and we can see that they bounce up and down that doesn't look quite right so it's outside of the range of the soy steak so let hits clam let's hit clamp range that didn't change anything so let's hit lube post and now it looks good awesome let's do the same with the idol so clamp range and Lube pose and now when we skip ahead to the end we can see that it animates beautifully okay let's have a look at the punch left clamp range and that loops perfectly and the punch right climb range that looks good too then we have the run animation clamp range and whose true and remember to loop the pose that looks fine too then we have the swing one clamp range and it loops this swing to clamp range and it looks perfect cool so this was just setting up the import settings now we can go ahead and hit apply and it reinforced asome so what we want to do now is we want to take the arms dragging onto the main camera under the player then maybe cero out the positions and now we can go ahead and drag out the game view here maybe drag it let's see you can go ahead and make it bigger like that make it a separate window and now we can adjust the position of our arms so if we hit play now you can see that doesn't look too bad let's actually go ahead and disable our melee weapon so I'll just drag that back so our melee system here go ahead and disable that let's focus on the arms a bit more we could also get it to play and as animation by default which I think we should do so you can difference the apply weird motion if you're having a problem where the animation just jumps or Wiggles or it's laggy then try unchecking this or checking it back on because there are really still some box with the Meccan em system and that usually helps so you are gonna get a lot of errors or silly things happening really just google it and try to figure it out this is not an easy process okay so the arms 5 now let's create a controller for this and remember the controller is what makes it actually animate so this is what controls the animation and the blending between them so let's go down in the project pane hit the right click hit create and then animated controller and now let's rename this to arms controller and now when we select them in our scene view and drag it in there we go we should be able to double click this arms controller and it will open up the animator let's maximize this and you can always get this by going to window animator I like to have it at the bottom so I can see what we are doing in the top of the view here so now let's just quickly get in an animation here so we can see what is happening let's just throw in the idle on our animator so what we can do is we can go through our project and then open up our arms and you can see the different stuff that is our arms and then we could drag drag in one of these animations so just take the idle for example and drag it in but what I'm going to do instead is go under the anim right click create state MC and a state is really just well it's better to explain it with examples a steak be standing it could be running it could be attacking and such so it's really just what the play is doing right now and so we have an animation to display that so this state is going to be called idle our play isn't doing anything and then the motion that's the animation so let's hit that little button right there and go into the assets and let's find while there are plenty of idle animations there so it's good that we have the path at the button so button so we can see where it comes from and we want the asset arms arms five fpx so that's the one we want uncheck the foot I K and now when we play the game because this is set to default we can see that our arms are playing the idle animation we should however you see this animate we should see a progress bar for that animation and again this is just about unchecking the apply wield motion and now we see it there so you can see how far into the animation we've got cool so that should loop just fine now let's bring in our arms quite a bit something like that that looks a lot better I still think they are quite big in the view whoops so let's maybe bring them down a bit and bring them closer yet and that's much better so let's just maximize this and have a look that looks really nice but this is just preference or like them being in these sides and at the bottom of the view so it doesn't distract the player but really just play around with it until you get something that looks nice let's just have a quick look and see whether or not this loops right so when the blue slider here goes all the way down we should see no bumping it lives just fine cool what we could do now is we could apply the texture to get them looking much better so under our arms we have the arm amateur and this is just all of the different bones and it just extends out almost into infinity then we have the mesh and then we have some objects that are used to control the armature I recommend you leave these be else you're gonna get some oops my phone went off there I recommend you leave these be else you can get some annoying areas in the console saying that they are missing so just leave them okay so if we select our mesh let's go ahead and take a look at the material here and so we can just go ahead and drag on the arms diffuse texture there and change the College completely white so so now we should see the textures working just right that looks really great okay cool so now that that's working I just want to give out some cool tips and tricks because you might experience what is called clipping so if I just move these even closer to the camera like this maybe that's gonna get it oh I'm of the whole camera there so just the arms I'm just gonna try to show an extreme case there we go this is called clipping and this is whenever our mesh goes in within goes within our camera render bounds so right now our arms is too are too close to the camera for it to render to adjust the clipping planes which is exactly this so how near an object can be for the camera to render it we can select the camera and go to the clipping planes and then bump in the near the near variables let's go to something like 0.03 and this is just much better now we can see the whole arm though you might notice it and notice a problem with this we can now see the cylinder that are attached to the player so we can see this cylinder and I would like to keep the cylinder there since it's really nice for just quickly finding the play and so I just want to it to be invisible ingame and to do this let me just undo the position of the arms here so they won't be all weird there you go and then adjust the clipping planes again so serpent zero three to hide this in game what we can do is we can create a separate layer for them so now let's go ahead and select our graphics this is the cylinder and let's go ahead and go to layer and then hit add layer and we're gonna call this player cylinder I've already done this earlier when I wished we're playing around with this so play your cylinder and then go back to the graphics and select the layer so play your cylinder now we can go under the main camera to what's called culling mask which is now set to everything and if we then uncheck the play your cylinder we can see that this cylinder stops drawing in game so now we have it working and we have it positioned and you can also have the arms get as close to the camera as you want so that's basically it for this tutorial guys I hope you enjoyed it this was just getting the arms set up to work in its most basic form in the future we're gonna take a look at animating them and making them work with weapons so look forward to that thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video
