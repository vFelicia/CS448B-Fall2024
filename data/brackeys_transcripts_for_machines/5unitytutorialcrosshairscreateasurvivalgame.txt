hello and welcome to the fifth episode of our survival gam series um done by brais I am the CE of brais and today uh is going to be a hopefully pretty quick tutorial cuz I'm in a hurry as always and it's going to be about how to implement crosshairs so that the player knows exactly where the center of his screen is um so let's go ahead and get started maybe even some materials and colors I don't know let's see how much time we have um okay so I've opened up Unity again again and then um yes so I've open up unity and we can just go ahead and drag the animation clips that we created in the last tutorial under our animations and um so save this and we can uh go ahead and create the um the cursor the Crosser so um what we need to do is we need to open up some kind of um photo editing program some kind of Graphics program um this could be that's a pretty cool um free alternative to photoshop that uh which I will be using um so open something like that up um if you don't know how to do this this will be pretty simple but then you can just find something online undo what's called um I think it's pixel art or something like that um which um you'll need some kind of image that does not have a white background else it will look weird so um okay so create a new new document and we can just call it this cursor and um it's going to be about 16 by 16 pixels but you can scale it down um um and it's just a really small square and um I'm going to double click on the background and call this BG and then just turn this layer off and uh then I'm going to create a simple round shape um it's nothing fancy and I'm not going to teach you anything in Photoshop it's just um really basic so and this this is going to be white you can make it whatever you want and I'm going to click and drag in the center holding down alt and shift and yes that looks about right and we can go ahead and take the opacity down to about um 70 and then we can go ahead and save else and then navigate to your Unity project so um minus undo my Dropbox um undo the D drive Ono the Dropbox Brack Keys No wait um survival I think it's called there it is and then assets and then here you can just save as a Photoshop file um because Unity recognizes this um else you can go ahead and save it as a PNG or a jpack everything will work also I think they use Tiff but I'm not entirely sure GIF is probably not allowed but you can try it out okay so um hit save and all right and then we can go back to Unity and that's the photo editing part of this tutorial now we can go ahead and create uh a new kind of game object so go to game object create other and then hit the gy texture bum bum bum and uh one very important part of the goey texture is that it always needs to you know need to know where it is at so um by default it's at the 0.5 0.5 and z and the set won't change everything uh anything I'm sorry uh the the Z won't uh change anything at all because this is all relative to your camera so if I go ahead and hit play this is always stuck on your camera this is a 2d element and it won't change you can it's not acting in the 3D space um so you can just go ahead and leave that at zero and if you want this type of graphic to be anchored uh in the corner then you can go ahead and type z0 and in will and it will be anchored in the left corner but this we want to be anchored in the center so um and what do you use to adjust it you use what is called pixel inset because um there are many forms of um guy um guy means graphical user interface and um there are many ways to do it but basically pixel inset is how far away this is from the Cent but it could be from the center it could be from the uh left side right side it could be from the corners in pixels the element should be so how far away from some point the um the the guey should be in pixels and this way it will always be the exact same distance um from some place no matter your screen resolution so this is what you'll need to be adjusting it else it will change when you maximize and minimize so um but for now we are going to uh change the texture first of all so you can go ahead and drag the cursor element uh in here and I don't know why I have named this cursor this should be cross her I'm a little out of my mind today and then you can change the texture to GUI down here in the import settings and this is really important because GUI is much higher image quality than texture this is important remember this gii is um so much better quality and can be um it it can it don't need to be perfectly Square um textures can only be 1,25 5002 um 64 32 16x 16 all this kind of stuff GUI elements can be anything you want so um the back size we'll just change this to 32 not that it will match it and then hit apply and then go into the unity Watermark small which is what our G is named and then you can change the width to 16 and the height to 16 and we can go ahead and zero out the pixel inset now this won't make it perfectly centered um this will make it centered from the corner of the guey element so we should go ahead and uh say um about eight and I think it's eight may might be minus 8 I think this should be the sensory um but you can we can do some testing on this later for now we can just leave it at z0 it won't matter that much um so now we have this um element in the center of a screen and we can make this smaller we can make it bigger just adjusting the width and height or going into Photoshop and doing it um so let's rename this to cross hair and um yeah that'll be it um so that's it for this tutorial um I'm sorry that uh it's so quick but I haven't got time for anymore and um I'll see you next time thanks for watching n
