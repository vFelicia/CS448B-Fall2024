no one just wanted to let you know that I will be live streaming in just a moment so if you want to see that head on over to twitch.tv / Brakiss and yeah i will be live in just a moment and what we will be making today is a replica of the very popular game called curve fever which is basically like a modern snake game so I'm just going to head on over into unity here and show you kind of what it is that we will be making and this is a two player game and you can see it's really just about avoiding of course hitting the tail of the other player or hitting the edge of the map or of course hitting your own tail and on the tail rendering part here is done using the unity line renderer which has seen some major improvements in unity 5.5 and that is currently out in beta so we'll be playing a bit around with the beta here and just checking some stuff out so I hope that you will join us there and without further ado I will see you in the next video
