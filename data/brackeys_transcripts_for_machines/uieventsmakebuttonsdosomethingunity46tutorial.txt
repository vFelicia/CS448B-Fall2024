thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to the second tutorial covering the all new unity GUI system introduced with unity 4.6 again this is in a public beta so in order to download this please head over to the unity website and you can download the free beta there awesome so before we get started today with creating some buttons that will actually do something whenever you press them I just want to quickly mention that you can of course head over to forum break is calm if you have any questions or if you make something cool please post about it there there are many people here to help and chat with you so cool let's dig right into today's subject so as always I've opened up unity and you can see that I again have a basic scene here are not much to it it's just if we take a look at it here in 3d space it's just this Sun that I've made using a sphere and some particle systems and then I have set up this purple background here then I've created a very basic UI which I showed you how to make in the last video which is of course available at the YouTube channel and if we dig under the canvas here you can see that we have one change scene button so let me just focus on that and that's it right here I've done nothing other than changing the color a bit and changing the text down here and that's basically it so we are ready to go ahead and make this button do something because right now when we hit play and hover over this and click nothing happens so I thought what we could do is is make something really simple which is just changing the scene whenever we press the button so in order to do this we are going to go ahead and create a script that has a function where we will change our scene so we could put this on the button itself or we could put it on the camera or any other object for that matter I'm just going to go ahead and create an empty game object by pressing ctrl shift and Oh going up here in the menu and I'm going to rename this to let's say underscore manager just because in most most of my games I like to have a game object dedicated to doing stuff like changing scenes adjusting settings and spot instantiating things and all that I like to have this manager object that takes care of kind of managing the play session so I'm just going to zero out the position just for good practice let's hit add component new script and let's make this of type C sharp though this will of course also work with JavaScript not much conversion needed here and let's go ahead and call this our change scene now let's that look like this to open it up in monodevelop and it's just going to open up here oops mine is actually opening in Visual Studio now well that's just fine you can of course use monodevelop also by the way the new the new integration with unity and Visual Studio is really awesome it's something that you should check out I know of unity posted a lot about it on that blog just search for unity vs and you should totally check it out it's it's really cool so not much needed here we actually can just delete the start function and then instead of the update here we are going to rename this to let's say change the change to scene and let's give this a parameter so let's give it a string value no actually let's give it an integer so let's do integer and let's call this scene to change to and then in here we're simply going to do application dot load level and inside of this we are going to give it this scene change and when we just write it like this unit is expecting an integer value meaning just a number which is the index of the scene we could also do a string like this and then maybe do scene 1 but when we set it up like this we can call this function and then we can just give it an integer and then we can put it in here so that means that if we have multiple buttons maybe changing two different scenes we simply we can simply call the same function and then it will vary the scene that it changes to you based on the argument that we give it one thing that we will have to do in order to call this from our button is make this a public void like that and that is very necessary or we're not going to be able to do this now let's save this let's hit back into unity see if we have any errors looks like it's fine now we can go ahead and find our button let's just check on the manager yeah it's there now we can go ahead and find our button under the canvas then we can go down here and under the on click we can hit the plus sign to make something happen whenever we click it now we're going to reference our manager object so simply drag it in there and then we have a list of all of the different functions that sits on that object and by default we have some stuff under the game object we have some stuff under the transform and then we've created a script called change scene and now we have all of the different stuff inside of the change scene and we of course just want to select the change to scene and you can see that it takes an integer so we simply click that and now we have the ability to just select the integer value here so right at the scene that we are right now is going to be called scene 1 and that's just going to have an index of 0 what we want to change to you is scene 2 and we're going to give that an index of 1 so we're going to set this to 1 now this should theoretically work but say we want to set this up with a string value instead well then we simply head into our script instead of an int we type in string here and then we simply put this interchange to you again now we save and we're going to wait for unity to update then we are going to go under here you're going to select change scene change the scene and then we can give it a string instead and we're simply going to call this scene to you so now it doesn't matter what index it actually has now remember whenever we want to change between scenes we need to add them to our our build so let's go in the build settings or press control shift B let's hit add current to add scene one and let's also drag in scene two now you can also see the indexes to the right and you can change the index by simply dragging cool so now when we hit play and click the change scene button you can see that we change scene to scene two hooray we've finally made it and that's the basics of adding scriptable events or adding clickable events to buttons so this technique can also be applied to sliders so you can change values depending on a slider value so if that's something you want to see or anything else in general please leave it as a comment and I'll make sure to cover it also I'm very sorry that I've been away for so long but I've been working on some really cool projects that I will hopefully soon be able to share you so as always thanks for watching and if you have any questions about today's video head over to farm table Rockies to come and simply create a thread so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
