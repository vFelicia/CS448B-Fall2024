in this video we're going to have a look at destroying things in unity this is a pretty easy and short video but creating shadow effects in unity is just so much fun so let's get started destruction in unity is something that can be achieved in two ways the first one is destroying your object through some kind of script here's an example of a unity asset that does exactly that we can see that it splits up our objects into chunks and then apply its physics to each chunk however this way is actually really performance intensive and also as you can see sometimes quite expensive what you can do for free is split up your model in some kind of modeling software this way you will have way more control over how the ARCIC shatters a good example of this is we create here we don't want to split this up into chunks instead we want all of the different wooden panels to separate and some of them to break so it looks like wood and the glass bottle here should for example be hollow of course not everyone knows how to do this stuff in the modeling program before the crate and bottle dark has actually gone ahead and made destructible versions already to download them we simply go to dev assets comm choose western props back to surprise and hit the blue button then to open the example scene that I'm using simply unzip the file double click on the folder and then doubleclick on the unity package right so let's begin with the crate let's go to western props prefabs and drag the wooden crate into our scene we can then hit F to focus on it and this is currently without a Collider so let's go ahead an add component box Collider and let's also add a rigidbody of course this model is not currently split up instead we have a separate version that wouldn't create cracked that if we drag it into the scene you can see all of the different pieces let's expand this in the hierarchy so like the first piece hold down shift and select the last piece as well to select all of them that's it add component and let's add a mesh Collider of course mesh colliders are colliders that adjust themselves to the mesh we'll also have to check off convex here and now we can see all of the colliders in our scene view of course we'll also want to add rigid bodies to enable physics for these parts let's hit add component rigidbody let's have each of these parts be around 0.5 kilos and set the mass of the wooden crate to something around 10 now all we need to do is substitute I wouldn't create the correct version whenever we want it to be destroyed let's take a wooden crate cracked here and drag it into the project panel to make a prefab out of it I'm just going to hit apply let's remove it from a scene select the wooden crate and add a new component we can call the script something like destructible like C sharp and hit create that let's doubleclick it to open it up in visual studio and of course what we'll be writing here it's going to depend on when you want your crate to be destroyed in our case we'll just set up a simple example where whenever we click on the create would give the actual destruction let's remove our two functions and instead write void on miles down now just like start an update on Mouse down is a callback function in unity that means that whenever unity detects we've clicked on the object onmousedown is going to be called this of course requires the object to have a collider but we've added that already so in here we can instantiate our splendid crate but first we need a reference to the object let's create a variable we'll make it public to access it in an inspector we'll make it of type game object to create a reference to a prefab and we'll name it something like destroyed version now in our onmousedown function will write instantiate to spawn an object the object we want to spawn is the destroyed version we want to spawn it at our current position so we'll input transform dot position and with our current rotations that will input transform rotation as well and let's close this off with a semicolon now of course other than spawning the new version we also have to delete the old one so to do that we simply write destroy and then input game object with a noncapital key this refers to our current object that the script is setting on that's actually all of the coding that we need to do now we can just save this script head back into unity we can see a new empty slot here this is where we can drag in a wooden create cracked prefab try saying that three times over let's have a look in that game view here and we can easily see the crates so we can just go ahead and hit play and when we now click on the crate it shatters and just to show you how easy this effect is to apply to other objects as well we'll take the whiskey bottle and drag it into our scene hit F to focus on it we'll go ahead and add a new Collider you could of course go for a mesh Collider here but I think the box Collider will do just fine let's add one let's also add a rigidbody and our destructible script now we can turn down the mass to be something like point five and we of course need to create a destroyed version to do that we just drag in the whiskey bottle correct we can see that this only has two parts let's select both of them hit add component mesh Collider let's make sure to check off convex and we'll also add a rigidbody finally we can set the mass to something like point to make a prefab out of this object again I'm just going to apply remove it from a scene select a whiskey bottle and I'll drag in that prefab now this might be a bit hard to see with our current camera angle let's use a nifty trick from my recent top 10 unity tips video so let's get a good look in our scene view let's just zoom out here a bit so we can also see the crate somewhere around here let's select our main camera and hit control shift F that's going to align our camera without seeing you we can also easily check our whiskey bottle and just duplicate it a few times and move it around just so we can see this working on multiple objects let's now hit play and you can see that we can now shatter these balls and it looks awesome and of course the create a small let's pretty much all I wanted to show you in this video this is really one of those very simple techniques that you can just have so much fun with if you want to challenge yourself you can experiment with creating a script that will make an object shatter if it falls from a high enough distance here's a hint on how to do that on the screen oh and I will of course go ahead and add all of the colliders and rigid bodies to these prefabs so that when you download the pack everything just works right away I'll even include the example script just make sure to add it to the objects yourself so that was pretty much it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did make sure to subscribe so you don't miss another video I upload Sundays and when I space also if
