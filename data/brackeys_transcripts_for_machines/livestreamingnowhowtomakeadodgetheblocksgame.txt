hello one this is just a very quick video to let you know that I will be live streaming on Twitch in just a second I might already have gone live by the time this video airs and basically that's because we just reached level two on patron that is the four hundred dollars a month mark and that's amazing thank you so much to all of the people who is donated and this live stream will be the first of hopefully many and I've promised to livestream at least once a month so we'll begin the with this one and we'll see how it goes and I just wanted to show you that on the game that we are going to be making in this stream it looks like this and it's kind of a dutch d falling our blocks kind of gave a game so we have the player controller here and we have the blocks that randomly spawn and they will increase in their falling speed and once you get hit you can see okay that was not the best display but we have this cool slowmotion effect that I really like so that is what we are going to be recreating in this stream and I was of course also be answering some questions so head over there if you should miss it for some reason I will try my best to upload this to youtube somehow but I'm still figuring out some of the tech stuff so I'll see you there and by
