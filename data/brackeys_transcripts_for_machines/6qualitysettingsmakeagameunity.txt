thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to video number six in make a game a short series on making a cool little video game in unity in this one we are going to take a look at quality settings or render settings inside of unity those two are often confused so I'm just going to clear that up and we're going to talk about stuff like aning and uh uh how many lights you can have in your scene and just overall the adjusting the quality of our game so let's dive right into it actually before we do I just have a very short sneak peek into the game I'm developing at the moment called squel and this is just a wallpaper I made for it you haven't seen anything yet and it's not coming soon uh in an alpha version to PC and mac and it's not called SEL so let's continue with the video here so um first off let's open up Unity as always and to get to the quality settings go to edit project settings and go to Quality and uh this is basically how advanced you want the graphics to be for your game and if you're making a a a game that you're serious about you really want the player to be able to select how good of a quality uh the graphics should be so that if they're on a computer who can handle that much uh they can change uh change it up to make it run better on the on the hardware so Unity have made a really really nice system for us to to adjust this and uh they use what is called levels and basically you can add some yourself and call them whatever you want but these are quality levels that you can switch between and you can standardize on different platforms and make available on different platforms so that once you release the game to a lot of platforms the users will be able to choose the quality um and uh let's just take a look at the prefabs they set up by default let's select the fastest one we can see now we don't have any shadows and uh the anti aliasing is completely off no an an isotropic textures and the texture quality is is horrible all of this is just turned off and if we go to Fantastic we can see some much more smooth edges still not that incredible uh we can see some detail shadows and and such so it it changes up the the way uh the graphics are rendered and uh and this is not that visible in our game because we don't have that many Graphics in there but once you start to get more it becomes very visible but basically I think there are way to too many levels for our game so let's delete uh let's delete delad first let's delete simple and let's delete beautiful so we have fast good and we have fantastic and uh let's rename the fastest to let's rename this to um fast uh or low quality let's just say low quality and let's adjust the settings here so basically this is going to run on the uh lowest quality devices and uh pixel light count is how many lights can be shown on one objects and uh this is actually not that taxing on the computer you can easily increase this to at least 10 on um on a a older desktop computer if you're on mobile devices you have to be a lot more careful uh then I would lower it by quite a bit but definitely for computers you can always stay above 10 uh the texture quality let's make that half resolution an uh an an isotropic texture is let's make that per texture an the alas thing let's say that's completely disabled so particles is something that we will just keep off Shadows I think we should enable Shadows since they add quite a lot to the game so let's make hard Shadows only and they should be medium resolution actually let's do low resolution this is really up to you and it depends completely on how much you have in the scene uh because our level is so simple we could easily bump this up but I'm just going to assume that you have made more than what I have here uh so okay so the low resolution stable fit is fine no Cascades and the shadow distance let's increase that to 30 uh and uh that's basically how far away you need or how close you need to be to the subject before the Shadow shows uh the resolution is how uh itchy this shadow looks so if we turn on the light here you can see here there are some jacked edges uh that is removed by increasing the resolution and hard and Sh soft Shadows um that's not something you need to worry about if you have the free version of unity now let's go back into the quality settings here and let's adjust the second layer let's call this medium quality not all these fanc terms and let's increase the light here to 50 and that's way more than you're going to need but that's okay uh we could also do 30 just to make it more realis istic uh the texture quality now we want it to be full resolution we want this to be per texture still anding I think we can easily bump that to at least two um maybe even four uh the Shadows both hard and soft Shadows definitely and medium resolution you could do high uh I'm just going to stick to medium and fantastic that's when we get to bump it up quite a lot so let's make this uh high quality and the pixel light count could be 100 uh texture quality full resolution for done analizing bump that up to eight soft particles are fine uh the high resol very high resolution shadows and uh that all looks really great what you can do is add a um make this a little less expensive on the hardware and then make an ultimate quality or fantastic quality uh because there are there is quite a gap between medium and high quality um but it's it's really it doesn't make that great of a difference but whenever we play test you normally want to be in the highest quality so you can get all the detail right and then later play test in low quality uh settings and if you're you're you're lag spiking or something because you both have to run unity and the player uh you can bump it down to something like medium but that was basically it for the quality tab uh I also mened mentioned the render settings and these are often confused you get to them by going to edit render settings and now you can see we have been here before in one of the previous videos we just light the ambient light uh how we liked it and that's done under the r render settings whoops I jumped out there and this is where you can add stuff like you can change a default um Skye boxes default textures of different kinds uh flares and Halo you really don't need to tweak that uh this that much in in an a ordinary game you might add some FK not in in in our game yet at least um and you might add a default Skybox material but really you should just leave this be ambient light though is is very important and and you should definitely have a look at how you want the ambient light to be uh cool and one thing to mention the render settings are scene oriented so if I make a new scene and I want some fog in there I can just turn that on and the old scene will still have it disabled whereas the quality settings are for the whole game uh cool so now let's make some defaults uh on our different levels so let's just assume that we're going to run this as a stand alone that means um that you build it for PC and mac and uh let's set the uh default level here by pressing the arrow beneath the arrow which means Standalone and let's change this to high quality so now that's going to be selected by default and uh let's see the phone here uh that must be an iPhone let's change that to low quality the same with the Android phone let's change that to low the Blackberry definitely low uh Windows store apps that depends on where they're displayed let's say medium uh the wp8 uh the Windows Phone 8 low quality and uh that one that must be the OU Ouya uh don't know that much about its Hardware I'm not I don't think you're going to be publishing to that but uh let's just bump that up to high and then for the web player let's make that Medium quality by default and uh oh they follow along oh they're both web right so let's just make that a medium quality and that was pretty much it for this tutorial I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video
