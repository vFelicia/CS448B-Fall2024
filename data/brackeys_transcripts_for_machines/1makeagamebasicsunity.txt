Hello, everyone and welcome to the first video in make a game a short series where I'm going to cover The basics of making a video game and it's going to be a lot of fun. So this is for you who thought [hmMm] I want to make a game. I've got a cool idea. I want to get into the business it sounds cool anything [like] that You don't need any knowledge to begin out with on the matarese So we'll cover everything and it's going to be a lot of fun. So let's get started [in] [this] video I'll just explain what tool we are going to be using and why and Then I'll move on to showing you where you can get it, and we'll also be starting up a project and just getting the basic Elements in there, so just really really the basics of everything Cool, so first off. We are going to be using unity 3D, or it's not really called 3D by unity and The reason why is that it's a very [well] known, so you're going to be [able] to find lots of documentation [onto] how on how to do several things it's also very beginner friendly and Still a lot of experts and professionals use it because it's fast and it can create Really powerful things in a very short amount of time So it's really the engine of fun if you still want to do a lot and maybe even do some scripting Unity is really really great and lot of it can [be] achieved using visual stuff Cool, so let's go to unity 3D comm then head under the download section hit download [okay], so now we can just go ahead and hit download unity 4.2. It might have changed since this video and We are going to be using the free [version] of unity which is still really powerful But there is also a pro version with the black skin here. Which has more advanced features but for beginners and even intermediate users most likely That's not something you're going to need that bad so hit the download unity 4.2 and it will download I already have the have it installed, so let's just close this and I've opened up unity already and this is just a quick preview of what kind of game [you're] going to be making it's a ball rolling game and If we just hit play [here] You can see that. I can roll the ball to each side and the camera will follow and I can jump and That's the basics of what we are going to be making in the next few tutorials We might expand onto that we're definitely going to create some more interesting level design. This is really boring But that's really the basics of the game Okay, so go up to file hit new project and you [might] be prompted to do this when opening unity Then you can select the project location. I'm going to do browse here, and then go into Dropbox I like to store everything in Dropbox so I can keep a backup of my project then make a new folder and call this make a game select that and Now we get to select what packages we want to include these are [other] default packages these contain stuff like a FirstPerson controller for Firstperson games which you can just Import into the game and it will work already without any scripting. So these are just packages unity made for us Which we don't have to make on our own [I] have a little more than usual, but that's because I've downloaded some extra from the unity asset store [ok] so right now. We are fine with what we have we have we might Use the physics materials in a future tutorial Along with stuff like sky boxes, but we can always import [these] later. I like to keep the project clean and tight Now let's hit create Now unity is going to load up all of the files running in the background, and this is how it should look We can see that. There are a bunch of different windows I'm just going to go over them [quickly] as I don't want to get this to get too boring First off we have the scene view this is where we can see all objects and navigate around To navigate a route the scene view [I] use the alt button This is really going to do all navigation for you. So if you hold down old we can click and if and drag and we can pan around stuff if we use alt and shift Or holding [cTRL]. Sorry we can drag and if we use the zoom Scroll wheel we can zoom in on things if you find that you get lost in the scene view We can go up to the right hand side and [click] the center of the cube this will change from perspective to iso, and So on If you are not familiar with camera technology you can just [ignore] this Then we have [the] different axes which we can click to quickly snap to side views front views and so on Cool over here on the left hand side. We have the hierarchy this is all this this shows all of the objects in our scene Right now we only have the main camera, and that's just drawing drawing a blue color Then we have the game view and this is where we want to be when we are testing out [our] game Then we have the inspector which shows all [of] the different things you can change Once you have something selected in the hierarchy or the project pane, so that's basically the [settings] tab Then we have failed to load which we are just can ignore Then we have we have the project pane And then here we are going to see all [of] the different things in our project which we can choose to have Inside of this particular scene scenes are like levels so this Stores Data for all the levels and this is from this particular level then we have stuff like the console where you can see error messages if you have made mistakes and scripts and The animator which we are going to ignore for now Cool you can also switch between different kinds of tools over here in the left hand side to get this grid showing you can click on this landscape and Disable it and enable it once. This is enabled the grid will disappear Cool Now let's actually get started creating an object so let's go to game object create other and then let's choose the Cube we can see over here in the right [hand] side on the transform that our cube currently has a position of 3.9 on the x 0.1 on the y, and 5.6 on the Z we want to just zero out this transform, so simply type 0 0 and 0 in those three fields We can also hit f while hovering over the scene view to focus on our Cube This is handy for quickly finding items because we can just [select] them in our hierarchy and then hit f to focus on them Now that the position of our cube is centered. We should be able to see it in the game view It's very boring at the moment then. It's just a square and also. It doesn't have any light applied to it Let's change the scale of this to make [it] more exciting and then apply lights so if we go back [to] the scene view We can change the scale to 10 on the x 1 on the y and 1 on the z We're going to look at it from the side so we don't really want too much going on on the z axis the Blue One and the y is fine with one Now we can add a sphere which is going to be our main character our ball So go to game object create other select sphere now let's zero out the position x y and z and Then just drag it up to rest on top of the Cube Give it a little more than necessary, so [we] assure it won't drop through Now that we have this set up let's rename the objects to stay organized so go over in the hierarchy Right click on the objects and hit rename or select them and go to the inspector over here by this [check] [box] The check box is where we can disable and enable objects? Now let's type out a name. We're going to call this ball. You can call it Whatever you want make sure that you notice that unity is kept sensitive so that you don't leave spaces all around and That you are you are consistent with when you put a capital letter and a small letter Now select the cube hit rename for that also let's call this ground Then our main camera. We can also rename this oops Wrong one the main camera. I'm just going to do main camera, but without the space Now that we have this [setup]. We can go ahead and play our game but nothing will happen So that's not that exciting [still] so let's add a light so we can finally see what's going on this looks all very twodimensional So go to game object create other point light There are many different types of lights point Lights emit from one single point in space out through this radius also called the range it has different properties like color and intensity which you can feel free to mess around with Shadows are not going to work unless you have the probe They only work for directional lights, and they only work in hard shadows But that's fine to play around with So let's just move this to make it look a little bit eerie so first let's center it So make sure we know where it is in space then let's drag it up and A bit out towards the camera so you can see more what's going on. You can also drag on these [dots] to adjust the range It's a good [idea] to keep it soft and nice looking like this Now that we have that we can also rename That so let's call this light Zero one you're probably going to have many lights in our scene before [we] done so this was the basics of Unity3d [we're] also going to talk about what is a component? what's a game object and of course through some simple scripting to get our ball moving and unfolding, [we're] also going to Expand on the level design and maybe even do something with coins or pickups or something So collectible objects are always fun stay tuned for future videos, and I hope you enjoyed it [I'll] see you in the next video
