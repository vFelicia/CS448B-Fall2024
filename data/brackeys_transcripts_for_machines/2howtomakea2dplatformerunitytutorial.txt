thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to the second tutorial in the 2d platformer course today we're going to be taking a look at turning this relatively boring scene into something much more exciting like this keep in mind that the player is still placeholder art and that the platforms here are not so pretty so I'm probably going to change those but I really wanted to play them out with this a surrealistic kind of pixel oddodd style I would like to do a lot of particle effects in this tutorial and look at some explosions or something to pimp things up so it doesn't get too boring but something with with lots of colors and and yeah you get the idea cool so that's what we are going to be doing today before we go ahead and get started with this I just quickly want to say that I am finally because you guys have requested it so much opened up a practice apparel store so if you go to brakus that Spreadshirt dotnet you will be able to buy different kinds of tshirts with the logo also a mark if that's what you want and also I have made some cool designs like this one the right code one and as requested the I am a developer design so I might be a tad some more if if things goes well so please go ahead and check this out and yeah cool so that aside let's get this tutorial started so first off I'm going to open up the 2d assets pack and this is something you can download from brackish comm if you go to projects and then the 2d platformer course there will be a download button here where you can download the assets there of course completely free and once we open this up we get a bunch of different folders and this is the same pack used for the pong tutorial course so there's a bunch of different designs in here and you can of course use what you want just check out the readme because a very few amount of these things are licensed so under the 2d platformer we can see that I've made what is called an Tek texture Atlas also called a sprite atlas or a sprite map or a sprite sheet it has many names but it basically just means that you have different sprites or images in one big file so if I open this up in the image editor you can see that I have these four landscape things and then for different platforms in one image and first off it allows because it's it's completely rectangular this is 500 by 12 by 4 512 that means unity will easily compress the colors so it doesn't become as big as a file it will also make sure that it quickly loads up and yeah it will just well minimize the size of your game so it's it's generally good practice also if you're using Photoshop you can just directly import the Photoshop file and you can make changes directly so it's really fun and easy to add new designs then I have just a simple gradient blue background just so we don't get the boring unity blue color cool so I'm going to go ahead and import the Photoshop versions but you can of course follow along with the P and G's so I'll select both Photoshop files drag them into unity here into the project paint and pane and just release and you can see them appearing so first off let's set up the environment sprite atlas because there are a few things we need to change right now when we import this there are multiple things wrong first of which is that it's very small it's also not very pixely it's kind of blurred and everything is in one image so let's change all of this so let's delete this and select it in the project pane and under the texture type we still want this to be sprite but it but we want to change the sprite mode to multiple once we've done this let's change the pixels to units which means how many pixels makes up one unit in unity and we're going to set this to five I find that to be quite okay for the project we're making here then we're going to change the filter mode and this is really important this basically means how unity interprets the pixels and tries to smooth them or whatever does and we want this to be point meaning that there will be no smoothing whatsoever and that's important in pixel art because we want the edges to be very sharp then the max size we could set this to 512 by 512 but it's it's already there so why change it and then we can simply leave this at compressed if you want to go ultra small you can do 16 bits but then some of your colors might not be perfect so let's just do compressed that's going to work fine for us then now let's hit apply and let's open up the sprite editor which is something I haven't shown you before so click sprite editor and it will open up a window here it's usually very small but you can just go ahead and maximize it and this is pretty cool because unity has what is called automatic sprite slicing and that basically means that instead of having to drag a rectangle rectangle around every sprite we've made consider we have maybe a hundred sprites if we're doing character animations or something like that that can get really annoying and it's very prone to errors so instead unity has made a cool automatic sprite slicing system for us and all we need to do in order to to utilize this is go to the left hand corner it says slice click there select the type automatic because we haven't set this up in a grid like fashion the minimum size I think that's fine at 4 and the pivot we're just going to use Center by D fold these all default settings and you can change them individually after and then the method we're going to do delete existing so now hit slice and you can see that some rectangles appear around our platforms and around each of these elements here might be hard to see on camera but I promise you that once we select them here you can see that they're working actually this one is not so that's perfect because that means we get to go in and fix their error here so right now it interprets these two elements as being one sprite so what we can do to change this is we can simply take the first one here select it and just drag it up so that's going to be our first right that's going to be our tops right and just make sure that this is snapped correctly and and now it is you can also down here change the parameters to whatever you like actually we could go ahead and name these in a sec which I think they're going to do but if you want some some true position your precision on on your scaling you can you can just type in the numbers down here but now we want to add another sprite because right now the blue run here doesn't have a sprite assigned so what you do is you hold down control and you can see and then click and drag and you can see this green red rectangle appearing whoops that was only to show you I'm just going to delete this again by hitting delete so what we're going to do is we're going to hold down control and we're going to drag from up here all the way over here and of course if you've made mistakes you can still resize this to suit your needs and once we've done this we can go ahead and name this so let's start from the top here and call this background mountains let's do purple let's call this background mountains orange this one you guessed it it's going to be background mountains blue and the last one here we are just going to called ground maybe just for ground ground I'm just going to do ground even though we're not going to stand on it it it is just ground actually let's do for ground to it that just makes more sense and then the four platforms we're going to do platform one this is always really tedious but if you don't do it you will wish you had so let's do a platform to platform three and platform for awesome so I probably miss build half of these but which is can say okay so up in the right hand corner let's select apply awesome now we can close down the sprite editor and now when we open up our environment add less here we can see that we have all of the different sprites which we can select individually so this is really awesome if you just drag in the whole Atlas it will just select the first one but we are going to just get rid of this for now and let's just go up to file save scene and save project so to make sure that everything is working awesome so let me just check the time here so we yeah we have plenty of time left cool so what we're going to do now is first off I'm going to just select the camera here and I'm going to assume this out a bit because I think it's just a bit too focused on the the player here and want this to be kind of just paste and action like and that's not really nice when you almost can't see anything but the player so let's change the size here if we're still going to leave it in Auto graphic but we can assume out by pumping up the size so let's do something like maybe 15 it's a little extreme but I think it's going to work nicely for the game so we're just going to leave this for now and we can always go ahead and change it and the reason why we're leaving it in orthographic is we could change it put to perspective which would be easy when we are going to do parallaxing but it doesn't give us much control as to where elements are placed in the scene so I'm going to leave it on orthographic and if you don't know the difference between the two please just ignore what I said it's it's not going to be important for this course cool wow I'm doing a lot of talking today now let's let's do some action so first off let's delete the grounds it doesn't look pretty then let's drag in one of these platforms for our character to have something to stand out let's just do platform one so drag it in here let's move it down so let's Center it on the X and let's just do negative five let's do negative five point five on G the Y and let's go ahead and add a box Collider to this so hit add component physics to D and then box Collider 2d and it should automatically set things up and the reason why we're just adding a box Collider is we are probably never going to collide with the root here if you are making a game where you could collide with with the pillar itself then I would recommend going add component physics 2d and then polygon Collider where you can more accurately change the collision but for now we're going to stick with the box Collider 2d awesome so that was the first platform let's drag some more in here let's do platform 2 same procedure so let's do 0 X and then five point five to make sure that these are positioned exactly the same here and we can drag them to make sure that they are lined on the xaxis too by the way when dragging and holding down shift you will constrain the dragging to one axis so right now I'm not holding down shift and right now our I am that's just a nifty little trick so cool there that looks nice and that's did we yeah let's add a box Collider to this also so add component for six 2d box Collider 2d let's go ahead and just add the last platform's also so let's do platform three and of course this is something you can position as you want you can use them however you like I just wanted to provide some basic assets though this one is not the one I'm the most proud of I must say they will do the job so let's drag it in here and just position it so it it works it's fine a little bit of an overlap is better than a bit of a gap because that leaves just ugly ugly antialiasing and such and then the last platform for actually that's a de box Collider to that one also there and the particle added to platform for while we are added yeah and let's position this at zero negative five point five and let's just drag it out to the right zoom in here we can get this right and there's going to be just fine for now cause now we have four platforms for our characters stand on them now when we play the game you can see that he is indeed standing on these you will autos also notice that they are currently floating you can get rid of this by moving up the camera you could do that by parenting setting the target of the camera to a empty game object on the player that is higher than the player himself so maybe with a yvalue of like plus three and and that way we will make sure that the camera is also always raised a little higher than the exact center but that's not something we're going to do instead we're going to conceal this by having a foreground element in front of this as you can see on the picture here so that's going to work just fine goal so let's continue and now let's add some blue background here so let's drag in the blue background image actually all of the settings here we can pretty much just leave as is that they're going to work just fine so let's drag this under the main camera and let's see how this is position so let's make it sure it's n 0 0 0 let's also make sure that the scale is 10 and 10 actually let's do maybe 12 on the X just to make sure that we're not getting any weird clipping but we right now we're not seeing anything and that's because it's directly on top of the camera so let's just move this back a bed actually let's just move it completely out of the way into the distance here and then go back into 2d view and what we can do is we can lock this layer meaning that we will not be constantly selecting it because that can really be a pain so let's just lock this by going up here to layer let's hit add layer and make a background layer here so let's do background then select the object again and select the background layer and then up here under layers you can see that we have a layer called background you can lock that or you can just lock the sorting layer but I'm going to lock the background layer up here so just click the lock and now when we deselected we're not going to be able to select it so we can do stuff like box dragging and and all of that awesome stuff so we can really focus on making the fun instead of yeah you know selecting the background and all that kind of stuff being really annoying awesome so now when we hit play we can see that the background will follow us around and this is going to be just fine because I mean it's it's just a similar gradient you will notice that we have a bird of clipping here where the the sprite ends so let's just make sure to widen it a bit further maybe 215 that's pretty close to right screen ratio and and yet it's just much better so just go a bit of overboard with that and and it's not going to disturb you cool so now let's drag some more elements into the scene let's do a I'm actually let's do a foreground now let's do the foreground element here the foreground dirt let's drag this in and this is not going to need a Collider but let's Center it on the X and let's just drag it down on the Y here until it fits and one thing you probably want to do is you want to sort these things in sorting layers so let's select all the platforms and actually I just want them to be on the default layer but I can see that the default layer is beneath everything else so let's go ahead and edit the sorting layers and we can do this by just hitting add sorting layer it will bring up the sorting layers and let's just drag the default here above the background but under the player because we pretty much always want the player to be on top so yeah let's just arrange it like that so now everything by default will be above the background but beneath the player in the foreground and that's awesome so all of the platforms here we can just leave them at default but our foreground third let's make sure to select foreground for that so when we plug it and drag it over our player you can see that he will be hidden behind awesome maybe we should drag this down I didn't know let's see how this looks in the game view this looks pretty interesting on not too shabby maybe drag it down just a bit like this yeah that's pretty nice I really want to leave some room for just the deep blue sky and maybe even some clouds in the future but that's something we're going to mess around with awesome so now let's do some background mountains please do remember that right now when we are playing you will notice that the foreground and the platforms scroll at the exact same speed this is because we haven't implemented what is called parallaxing which is probably what we're going to do in the next tutorial I found a really cool way to do parallaxing without using a perspective camera simply by scripting in some position and it's gonna be really fun it's it really adds depth to the scene so that's for next time cool so let's go ahead and drag in some background elements shall we so let's select the let's do the purple one maybe or yeah that's one this one is going to be more into the distance so let's do the purple one drag it in here oops my phone's going off just a sec I'm gonna pause the video here and be back oh wow okay cool so I'm back I'm sorry about that that was not so professional but what we're going to do now is we're going to change the sorting layer to background and then of course it will be behind our blue background so let's make sure to select a blue background and change that sort layer to also background and then the ordering layer to something like Mound just a thousand because we are never going to have anything behind the the blue background here so now the background mountains purple let's select this and Center it in the X and let's do a Y of who why'd I know let's see what looks great in game here so strike this down maybe that's actually not too bad with the just barely appearing above yeah else it's gonna cover too much I don't want it like right where the platform's begin because then they're going to be overlapping and it confuses the players so something like this looks pretty nice especially when we get that parallaxing effect this is going to be really awesome so I quite like this maybe just move it up just a tad so we ended up with with about minus seven seven on the Y and that's going to do just fine I've made sure to make both the dirt and the background mountains pretty long so you can go ahead and and just choose the part that fits best of course when again when we implement the parallaxing we do need them to be quite long and we might even need them to do some repeating and some instantiation but that's something we're going to look at so let's not get ahead of ourselves let's first off import another mountain layer so let's do the blue background here I think I'm just going to exclude the other ones here though or the the orange one though it is pretty cool no I'm gonna exclude it for now so let's try the blue background drag that in here and as you can see I've added a bit of a blur to this you might like you might not like I think it's okay because and that makes it just easier for the eye to focus on the foreground so I thought it was a little necessary so let's again put this in the background and let's do the Odin layer minus 1 so it will be behind our purple mountains and for this we can just maybe offset it a bit in some direction we could also invert the scale on the X so let's do minus 1 on the X and that will maybe hide the effect a bit and then at the same time offset it so now as you can see we'll be em it's not so apparent that it's basically the same layer of course you can go ahead and change this in Photoshop and move around pics and stuff to hide this I'm not going to go so indepth because this is again just a tutorial but feel free to play around with anything and alter it the way you like it to so let's just move this down just a bit and I think we have something that looks pretty nice here I mean we have plenty of room for gameplay elements both going up or down and yeah so you can of course play around with these platforms and right now if we fall we will fall beneath behind the the foreground here so maybe we can make some some dying mechanics if you fall from a platform they don't need to be so close as I've made as close as I've made them here you can of course drag them out and make some some actual platforming instead of just walking on on one surface so that is actually something I'm going to do right now so I'm just going to move these up here just so we have a tiny tiny game to play um they're awesome so that was it for this tutorial what was this okay so this was a long one Wow time flies when you're doing graphics you can really get caught up in it but yeah so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
