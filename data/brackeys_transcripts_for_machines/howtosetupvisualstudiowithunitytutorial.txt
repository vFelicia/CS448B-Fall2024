thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to this video on setting up visual studio for Unity so in this video we are going to firstly install Visual Studio then we're going to set up unity vs which is a Unity package that nicely integrates visual studio with unity allowing us to use a bunch of awesome features uh which I will talk about in a sec then we will install a cool plugin called strium which I use all the time then we're going to set up my preferred um Visual Studio settings and finally I will show you how to install Styles or themes because let's face it uh your color scheme is the most important thing uh that's what kind of makes you look awesome compared to the audio program is just using the default one cool so why would you use Visual Studio well if you're on a Mac you can't uh Visual Studio is Windows only so if you're not on a Windows computer you can just skip this if you are however um you can pretty much just get used to visual studio right now I mean it's the most uh commonly used IDE ever um so you will encounter uh a problem that should be solved with Visual Studio at some point in in in your programming career and therefore it's a good program to get used to also Visual Studio is much more solid than uh mono develop at least uh that's my opinion I think mono develop has way too many bugs way too often and so visual studio um is is just a solid piece of software um also uh Visual Studio allows you to insert break points evaluate variables and expressions use uh code uh wi it kind of to generate uh code or to browse code uh we can install plugins it has intellisense which is uh the um uh the code prediction uh uh solution that Visual Studio uses which is actually pretty great so there are many advantages to using visual studio awesome so let's get on with installing a visual studio on a Windows computer so what you want to do here is you want to head on over to visual studio.com and once you get here you will uh very quickly notice that there are a bunch of different versions for uh Visual Studio it comes uh with the community version the express version and pro versions all that kind of stuff and uh when you first get here you might be tempted to just download visual studio Community right here and we are going to be downloading Visual Studio Studio Community but we are not going to be using the 2015 editions um those are currently in preview which basically means a uh public testing phase uh and so if you want to go with the completely solid build go to free Visual Studio in the top right hand corner and then download visual Studio Community from here great so once you've downloaded the uh Visual Studio installer simply click it and run to open it up and uh installing and uninstalling Visual Studio can be extremely slow and therefore I've done this beforehand but you should be able to Simply go through an a fairly uh simple installation process and uh then you should end up with a button that says launch visual studio and I'm going to do that now uh one thing that you will notice during the installation period is that um it will ask you which modules you want to install and there you can basically disable uh deselect all of them uh you will only need core Visual Studio components um however on uh my system right now I have installed the uh C++ uh module because I do a um Fair bit of C++ coding on this computer but that's completely up to you you can also import of the web stuff or whatever uh that you uh you think you need cool so uh once you start a visual studio you should be met with a screen that looks somewhat like this and uh once you have that open we can basically just close it again for now so and then we can move on to the uh Next Step so I'll just dock this on my secondary monitor here and take a look at what to do next so now uh we will integrate unity vs so in order to do this let's open up Unity I have a Unity 4 or 5.1 installed it just came out yesterday cool so I've made this uh kind of test scene to just show you how unity vs actually works and uh you can see here in my assets that I have three folders I have an editor folder a script folder and a standards assets folder and under the script folder I have a single script called drag rigid body and that just currently sits on this Cube that I've made and it simply allows me when I play to drag around this Cube and yes this is a script from the standards assets pack so if that's something you're interested in you can simply right click and uh import it cool so uh in order to implement unity vs um you are going to have to download something because what most people do here is they're going to edit preferences and then external tools and then they simply select uh visual studio. exe but that's not going to work uh so what we're going to do instead is we'll go to Unity vs.com and uh unity vs was actually created by a company called syntax tree which is now acquired by Microsoft so they are now working on it internally which is pretty cool but um the tools are still available at this website so simply click visual studio 2013 or whatever version you happen to be using uh and and simply click that and it's going to download about um 10 megabytes of an installer here you can see it's downloading there and I'm just going to cancel that and then instead go to my downloads because I've already downloaded it beforehand you can see here um and I'm simply going to click that to R whoops now I started the download again I want to show that in folder instead if I can get to it here here we go so I'm just going to double click that and run it and I will just close down these tabs again and then hit next and uh you can see again I've already installed this simply run through the installation process it's very easy and then uh you should be done however it's uh quite uh unusual with this installer that basically nothing nothing happens uh when uh it's done it looks like nothing has changed that's not entirely correct because if we go to this PC go to look at this see then program files and this is going to be 32 bits so times uh 86 and then we uh scroll down to where it says Microsoft you should see Microsoft Visual Studio tools for Unity and inside of this we have the 2013 version and finally here we have a do Unity package if you cannot find this on your system simply search for visual studio 2013 tools so you would just go uh like like this and it's it's right there you can see I already Al also have um the 2015 version um if I uh happen to uh should be happening to if I happen to need that so uh now let's double click this to open it up in unity and just like any uh other um Unity package it will just import when you click a button and it should basically be done already so now we have a folder here called unity vs and after a second it will load again and say that the uh system or version specific dll was created and that's very important that it's created successfully in order uh for this to work uh also to make sure that everything is set up correctly go to the uh Visual Studio tools tab that should appear up here if not you can refresh it by simply pressing a tab uh up here and it should refresh the bar and then hit generate project files just to make sure cool now you can also see under edit preferences external tools that it says Unity vs. openen file and that it has uh these arguments awesome so what we can do now is we can go to visual studio open in visual studio and it's going to boot up our project inside of visual studio and we should in a moment be able to see our full Unity hierarchy right here so you can see that we have we have the editor stuff the plugin stuff and uh the normal stuff I should say um uh separately uh but we can just collapse these two and under the assets folder we have scripts and there under we have the direct rigid body. Cs and uh we can even see what kinds of uh fields and methods uh it's implementing uh all of its members there so uh and once you click on that you can see that you can browse the code and you should have Auto completion enabled also so if I were to go uh like transform do uh position you can see that that's working just fine and it even gives us uh runtime uh errors and feedback so that's super cool awesome so that was actually the whole first part of this tutorial uh was just attaching this Editor to Unity and that's certainly something we've done you can also see that if I was to close this script here but keep Visual Studio open we can go under the cube and simply double click on the script here and it's going to instantly boot up in visual studio so uh they are indeed linked um actually really use utilizing these tools like attaching to Unity up here and uh error handling and breakpoints and all that that's for an entirely different video and uh they already have a lot of that kind of stuff on the plug and such so I'm not going to go into it here instead I will show you um the next uh Point here which is uh installing striping so when you're using visual studio uh and unity together you might notice that visual studio uh saves the uh files with a different line lending uh format than uh other editors you've been using or especially if you're using Version Control uh there might be some conflicts so the solution to this is just using strippen which is a plugin that will allow you to specify a certain uh eof end of file or EOL End of Line uh format um for saving files because End of Line uh formats can really matter a lot uh when using uh some files in some contexts on some systems it's a whole separate science but really just install this plugin so what you want to do is basically just search for uh strim um I will also have all the links in the description and hit download and uh then we're going to download the add in only installer for vs 2013 and we can just uh click that and uh it should uh put some files you can see here it says that it's already installed but it should put some files into uh the documents Visual Studio add folder and uh you can of course check it uh if there are there but it just worked for me the first time and you might need to uh restart Visual Studio in order for it to appear once uh you've done that you should be able to go to tools strip them and then just select Unix LF uh you can also convert files matching a reg regular Expressions a reg regular expression uh but I recommend just selecting Unix and uh get it over with that way so uh cool and uh next up on our list that was a quick one is U my preferred settings so I have this whole setup with Visual Studio where I like to keep uh my stuff and uh kind of how it uh does cod completion and all that if you would like these settings um and the style that I'm using using um you uh simply need to go to um the link in the description um that should be a download link to this bravs OR breis vs. siip file where if you open this you will see a breis v uh breis vs vs settings file and uh we can just copy this to the desktop and you can see it right here and this contains all the information that Visual Studio needs uh so uh in order to actually use this we simply go to tools then Import and Export settings then import selected environment settings go to next we don't want to save our current settings then we want to go in here we want to hit browse and you can see here that we have a folder for all of our settings files so simply copy this path go into a separate uh finder window paste the path and then here we want to copy our braies vs settings uh so simply copy those in there and you can see I already have mine but I'm just going to replace mine and now you can simply select it in here hit open and uh then we can hit next and you can see here we can choose what modules we want to uh install from this uh settings file uh so if that's something you want to keep uh the way it is you can go through um I recommend just doing all of it I haven't made any huge changes uh but if you want to use uh the standard uh kind of color scheme simply go under uh options environment and then uncheck fonts and colors cool so now just hit finish and it should reload everything here the interface and all of the uh preferences should uh slowly be added and uh while it does this oh okay it's actually already done so you can see here the uh theme that I'm using it's um it's the monai theme I believe and uh I've made a few changes to it I think it looks pretty nice um and you can see that I like to have the solution Explorer and Class View over here it's pretty standard for visual studio uh it's only in the unity version that they've put them over here but then again uh it's it's completely up to you you can also make the output here just go under the error list um whoops the have the error list a bit bigger here uh all of that is up to you that's just layout awesome so now that that's set up everything should be working and the last thing I wanted to show you was if you want your own color scheme you can go to a website called um Studio styles. or studi style. um and uh that should also be in the description and here they have over 3,000 uh color schemes so you can get exactly the the one you want and you can of course also very easily customize them uh if actually just open up visual studio here again should be able to see just how easy it is to customize so if we go to uh tool options then go under environment fonts and colors you should be able to see that everything is very easy to to change in here cool so that was basically it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and uh let me know what you would like to see next so thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video oh
