thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to the first video in this unity 2d short series so this is basically just going to be a a pretty short series where I'm going to show you how to use the new features introduced in unity 4.3 so here we have it 4.3 new 2d tools and they are great so go to unity 3d comm under the download section and make sure you have at least 4.3 downloaded and installed the type we of game you're going to be making is a pong type game and it's just oldschool pong but with updated graphics and I'm going to walk you through the whole process but I've also made a 2d pack an acid pack which you can download from the brackish comm yem website and from there you get all kinds of different cool things to use in many different categories of 2d games so first off we have the the pong game here this is basically what we are going to be making at least some what it should look like this at the end and for that I also have the full Photoshop file where you have all the different layers named correctly different parameters you can tweak you get everything fully customizable and all of the different individual sprites exported as PNG files and ready for importing and then I also have the platformer temple here if you want to make like a 2d sidescrolling platformer and I also have a speed add of that coming up so when it's going to be done I don't know yet but it's definitely on its way and for that is the Photoshop and the sprites also then the topdown arcade start type game and this is some pixel art also and then we have some tower defense where you can plant towers and make up your own animation and such so you have quite a few things to play around with here and all of this should get you started and then we have a various folder which now only includes a coin but it that will probably get more in there and if you make something cool and want to share it with the world please write to me and I might include it in the assets pack great so now let's get started with today's lesson so let's start up unity and yank it going with this tutorial so let's open up unity and a cool little trick is whenever you open up unity and don't want it to load up the project but instead wanted to open this wizard so you can open another one or create a new project then you simply open up unity and right after you have clicked it then hold down alt and it needs to be right after and then this wizard should pop up that's just really annoying when you have to load up a whole project and then open up another so that's a great little trick now let's go under create new project let's browse for from my Dropbox folder he'll add a new subfolder and let's call this pawn and select folder so Dropbox pong that's perfect we are not going to import any packages but we are going to set the defaults for 2d games and this is really important you either need to do this right now while making the project but you can also do it later and I'll show you in a sec how to do that so let's hit create and it will open up a an empty unity project set up for the new 2d tools again if you've already made something and want to adjust it to the new 2d stuff so then you can just go to edit project settings and then editor and then the default behavior mode needs to be 2d and great so now that we have set up our projects we can go to the scene view and see that this looks all kinds of weird we can see that this is now a two dimensional grid and you can go up here at the top of the scene view and go back to three view so disable the 2d view and then switch back again so it's a very seamless workflow from 3d to 2d okay so let's go ahead and import our first sprite a sprite is basically a texture I know there's the difference but it's not that important so let's go under the individual sprites under our pong to the assets pack and let's just drag in the background we're gonna adjust that first and so just drag it in and it's now imported and because we have selected 2d s our defaults you can see a new texture type has been selected called a sprite and under here we get all kinds of different settings the first off is the sprite mode we want that to be single because there's only one object or sprite we want to show inside of this image sometimes you have a whole spreadsheet is what it's called where you have all kinds of objects in one one single image but right now it's single the packing tag just ignore that for now pixels to units that's important if you import something and think way this this is way too small or way too large then you can change the pixels to units so making this smaller will make it appear larger and the other way around the pivot we want that to be centered for our background that means that it will be centered our anchor point will be centered in the middle of the picture and the filter mode should be bilinear the max size I want to bump that up to 2048 and that's because this is a really high resolution image but if you are making something like a web player game where you don't have that much resource to go with I would go ahead and bump it down a bit you can easily do that and the format just leave it at compress even though it says it won't that's because it's not made in the power of 2 and that's a longer to study discussion so let's just ignore this and hit apply great so now we can simply drag it into the scene view you will see it appear and we can drag it round and it works just right so that's just century our X and our Y and the Z should already be centered if not make it zero generally you want to work with your images in you know with as the directional axis of zero unless you really know what you're doing beforehand we used to sometimes sort images using the z axis but unity has made a new great way to do this called sorting layers and we're going to look at them in a sec first off you see this new component called sprite renderer this is where we can select the sprite also tinted in different colors and the cool thing about this color tint is it's no longer connected to the material so you can do it for individual objects and not have to create a new material every time now to the sorting layer so basically there are two things you need to remember for a sorting layer the first off is the sorting layer itself that's basically a group so there that could be a background sorting layer a middle and a foreground solid layer you could also split it up into enemies players but generally you have like a background and a foreground and then maybe some some more to split it up and then there's the order in layer and basically the higher this is the more on top it's going to get drawn so if this is higher than all of the other objects it's going to get drawn on top and this is basically a way to sort and different objects inside the same layer so let's go to the sorting layer hit at sorting layer and hit plus and let's change this to back ground and because we want this to get drawn beneath the default layer we're going to drag it above it that's not really logic to me but that's how the unity guys set it up there might be some really interesting research and its might it might be logic to you but yeah things that needs to be in the background needs to be on top so we'll just do that go back select the BG here and go and select our new background so layer and the ordering layer let's just that it would be fine to just set it at zero for now because we only have one thing in the background layer but I want what I want to do is I want to set this to something like whoops so something like minus ten and that's because we might have different background layers or objects in the background layer but I want this to be ultimately on the button this should be drawn after everything else meaning that we can simply just push it back a whole lot so we don't have to worry about it overlapping and where where did that sprite go oh it's beneath the background we're not going to get any of that one thing that can be extremely annoying whenever you are working with sprites in the foreground and have a large background um is that whenever you need to select it or drag it something in the foreground you sometimes get to select the background instead and oh no now it's all out of place and and it can it can be really frustrating so unity of course made something great we can use to take care of this problem that is the layer here so select the layer not deciding Lee at the normal layer hit add layer let's call this we can just do background you can call it something more specific if you want and then select our BG layer again and select the background layer there and well now you can see it's still not locked so we need to make sure that everything onto the background layer is locked to do this we go up to layers above the inspector and we can go down here under the background and we can actually see it is locked but you can disable it and enable it here so but this basically means once you have something selected you can still change it but if we deselect it we can't select it again we can do anything but we one will never select our background unless we go over to the hierarchy and selected there and then you can make changes so that's really awesome if you want to make much in the scene view and and don't want to select wrong things now let's set up our main camera so basically what I like to do is I like to Rin name this to main camera in one word and also you can see here this box is what will get rendered and you might think let's just drag this out so it just fits the background perfectly but that's not always a good idea because you're probably going to be publishing your game too many different kinds of platforms and therefore you're going to have many different screen sizes and resolutions and not only are they going to vary in size but then they're also going to change in the aspect ratio so some might be really long and some might be really tall and so you really need some space here so that so that if you have something really long this won't stretch out and you will get these blue ugly lines so we might just drag it up just a tad but watch out you don't go overboard and if you want to check this we can simply go to the game view and just drag this out to make a new window for it like this so untuck it and then we can just play around with the screen size and see we can go really really long before the blue starts appearing and what we can do even more than this is we can make sure the background is not and a color that you notice this much so we can change it from blue to something else so go to the background color on the camera go to the color picker and now we can go over here and select something more neutral a neutral grayish color and then just finetune it yourself until you get something you like and I think this looks just perfect so let's just drag that back the game view here let's just drag that into position and now our main camera has been set up great so this lesson is already coming to a close let's just quickly import our player so go to our individual sprites under the 2d assets pack and drag it into the project panel selected in the project panel make sure the pixels two units match so that this won't be huge and the other thing will be really small and all of the other settings are just fine now we can simply drag it on there and we can see it working because it's automatically under the default sorting layer so it will get drawn on top and we can press F to focus on it and see that we have some nice shadowing which I made in Photoshop and this looks just right we can move it just a bit out to the side here and see that it now looks just like in pong so of course we're going to be building more onto this we're going to be making some cool functionality I mean right now the game isn't exactly exciting and and it's going to be really awesome I'm looking forward to it and again if you want to get your some of your designs in the asset pack and contribute to this project then please write to me on Twitter at Brad keys suite that will be something on the screen right now indicating that it's Brad key suite and yeah so thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video
