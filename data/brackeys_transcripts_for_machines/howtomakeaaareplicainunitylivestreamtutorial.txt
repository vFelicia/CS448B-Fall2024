so everyone here's a video on making a a a replica if you don't know that that's a mobile game where you have to shoot out these pins in order to hit a circle and you can't hit your own pins because then you will die and the game will kind of start over this is a live stream recording and so I might pay attention to the chat once in a while but it's just a super fun little game and a lot of cool stuff to show so let me just show you how the game works here this is what we'll be making if I have play here we can see that we have this rotating circle and I can go ahead and shoot it to put these pins in it and it's basically just about putting it as many pins in here as possible and if you hit one of your own you can see what happens there so some some pretty fun effects and we might have a bit of collision error one once in a while but it's not the biggest thing we can talk about how to improve that later on in the stream so let's go ahead and create a new project queue to get started and I'm just going to go ahead and mark this as a 2d project put it in my projects folder where I have all my stuff it's very dear to me that folder and we can go ahead and name this something like a a replica and yeah I think that's going to be fine actually let's just put a space in there why not so a replica and we can go ahead and hit create project and it's just going to open up a totally empty unity project you're going to need basically nothing in order to follow this tutorial all you're going to need is a circle sprite if you wanted to look a bit better than using the standard knob which is very low resolution but I mean you can either make that yourself in Photoshop or or even paint actually because it's just a circle or go ahead and download one off the internet um also have a link in the description to the full project on github so now that we have our new project here let's go ahead and kind of sketch out what we want to happen in our scene first of all all we of course need a circle that is going to rotate all the time let's go ahead and create a new 2d object and make this a sprite let's reset the transform on that and this is where I'm going to be importing my circle so I'm just going to take my circle PSP here and that's just a simple Photoshop file you can use any kind of PNG just as long as has transparency you can see it's just a 256 by 256 white circle and that's all there is to it so I'm going to go in here and that's the sprite I'm going to then select that circle if you don't have a circle you can just use the knob but you will notice that it's very small and if you scale it up it's not going to look as good but I'm just going to select the circle here and this is 256 so let's do point seven five on the X&Y just to scale it down a little bit we can also kind of move this up and let's change the background here to kind of a white a tiny bit of yellow actually just to make it feel a bit cuter than if we made it totally white that feels very cold so this is a bit better maybe even do it tiny bit more something like that looks pretty good then we can take our sprite here and make that totally black then we can rename this to something like rotator and by the way the shortcuts for renaming things and a lot of people don't know this on windows is f2 so I simply hit f2 there and I can go ahead and rename it it's a lot easier than rightclicking going rename or trying to double click on it or whatever and going over here just f2 use it all the time it works in the Windows Explorer as well and for Mac that's just space spaces renamed on Mac did I say space i man enter enter that space is not going to rename a thing cool so this is our rotator and of course a rotator it needs to rotate so in order to do that let's create a new component and let's go ahead and make this the rotator component we're going to program in C sharp here and let's just double click this to open it up in Visual Studio that's just a weird warning that I'm getting these days nothing to worry about it something with my settings that are being kind of weird actually just got done recording a video on on my different settings my setup with Visual Studio and unity so look up for that it's going to be out in like a couple of weeks I have a some other videos that I want to show first Oh like a single week is it yeah it's going to take a few weeks I'm sorry I have a full schedule ahead cool so what we can go ahead and do here now is we'll just believe it delete everything we'll create a public float and this is going to be our rotation speed we can just go ahead and call it speed and this is going to be degrees per second and we're just going to default that to something like 100 that means like pretty much a third of a rotation somewhere between a third and a fourth of a rotation per second and I think that's going to be fine then we can make the update method one more time here and in here we'll do something like trans transform dot rotate and we don't need to rotate around because the center of a circle is the center of a circle so it's just going to pivot around that and that's going to look fine and in here you can see there's a bunch of overrides for this we're just going to be using the one that allows us to specify three different or an angle on the three different axes so we'll do an X angle at Y angle and the V angle so we'll go through around the X zero on the Y and then around the Z we'll do speed and then multiply with time that Delta time because we're doing this in the update method and we have to make sure that it's not framerate dependent so that should actually already our work just fine so if we go ahead and hit play here now we should see that our model we can't really see it here because it's totally circular but if we select it we can see that it's indeed spinning and we can control the speed through this variable here so we can bump that up or slow it down cool so that is on the basis of our game that's kind of the pivot for everything so now we can go ahead and add a new component and this is going to be a circle Collider 2d and just make sure it's the same size as your graphic here which is going to be by default for me here I can see and I believe that's pretty much all we need to do for rotator we could also just go out and tag it as rotator on right away so on that we can easily check if that's what we hit at a later point so let's just go ahead and add a new tag here create a new tag called rotator and let's select it and tag it as that okay you're tagged there we go and I'm just going to save it here saying it save it as level one or main level I'm just going to do main level here oops yeah this is not where I want to save it there we go main level and it's save on that and you can see the period down there again you can of course make multiple multiple levels just have some way of keeping track of how many pins you want to have in each level and once all of them are in the rotator once all of them have hit the circle you can go ahead and transition to the next one we're just going to do it more high score based on this one so yeah cool so now we can go ahead and create our pin and in order to do that we'll rightclick on your hierarchy code 2d object and then stripe and again we need to select some kind of source sprite here I'm just going to go for the circle and I'm going to make this quite a bit ah smaller so let's just take it here drag it down a little bit make sure it's zero on the X here and let's definitely scale this down quite a bit something like that actually looks pretty good and then we can go ahead and create another sprite beneath this so let's go again right click to the object sprite and for this one we're just going to select the UI sprite and this is just a square sprite but it actually looks just fine if we go ahead and kind of drag it up here in order to create whoops in order to create kind of a small sphere out of it I don't know the terminology that we should be using here but I think Spears just fine and we can go ahead and make this totally black as well so you can see what that does and we might need to just make it a tiny bit wider I think that looks a bit better just to kind of equal it to a one or two pixels something fairly simple I'm going to go ahead and drag this out as well something like that looks pretty good and we can always adjust the length of this and the size of the head and stuff like that at a later point when I will just have it somewhere around this so we call this one the sphere and we'll called the circle itself the pin and make sure that they are parented so that they will follow each other so that when we spawn up in our spear it's going to move a with it cold so now we can add some colliders so to our spew here we of course want to add some kind of box Collider 2d and we don't want this to collide with our with our circle on the pin on our spearhead here so what we want to do is go edit Collider and then simply drag this down a bit so that it doesn't collide and also drag this in so that it's right at the tip of our off my pin here cool so stop editing that colliding that looks good we can then take our pin here and add a circle Collider to this one as well there we go and I think that's pretty much all we need to adjust here we could go ahead and Mark some of this as on triggers and the question is whether or not we want to do that I think actually we might want to go ahead and do that but I'm just going to think about that a little bit we definitely want to add a rigidbody here so rigidbody 2d and we want to make this kinematic now so that it won't move on its own yeah I think that's it for our pin actually let's go ahead and mark this one as a trigger and let's actually do the same thing for our sphere here the thing that's going to be best so mark both colliders as triggers but we only want to tag our pin as a pin but we'll have a look at that in a second so now let's go ahead and create the functionality for kind of shooting this forward into our center circle and I'll just have a look in the chat here just to see if you guys are still out there yep everything's looking good awesome cool so let's go to a pin here let's create a new component and it's called it something like well we can just call it pin and hit create an ad make sure you selected C sharp again double click it and it's going to open up in Visual Studio so now we can go ahead and remove our two functions and again we'll have some public float with VP here and I'm just going to set this to something like it's actually hard um 20 probably something around that and we also want a reference to a rigidbody so we'll go ahead and create a rigidbody 2d and call it RB so these two things are configured in the inspector so we don't need to do any get component or anything like that then we can inside of our update method we can move our pin forward so we'll go ahead and say RB dot move position and this allows us to move the rigidbody to a new position while still checking for its physics so have we collided with something is there any kind of physics calculations that we need to do and if all that is it's cool it's going to go ahead and move the rigidbody so it's a lot better to use and transform the translate because that's not going to work well with collisions and of course it just shoots the object to the desired position so we need to move it a little bit at a time and that means that we'll have to take our current position which we can get by using our B dot position and then we want to add some vector onto that and the reason why I'm using our B dub position here is that this will actually return us a 2dimensional vector you can see here in vector 2 storing our current position where the Z is just 0 however if we use transform that position this is going to give us a vector 3 that's not what we want we want to only work with make the twos here because we in a 2d coordinate system so we can go ahead and hit Plus here and we can say something like vector 2 dot up that's the direction we want to move in then we can multiply that with our speed how far do we want to move each frame is going to be determined how add by how big or speed is and then we can multiply with time.deltatime again to make sure that we even out differences in framerate so we can go ahead and save this now and then we should see and the way to test this is actually by okay so we need to drag in the rigidbody forgot about that we need to go out and hit play but if we just do that it's just going to kind of disappear and go right past a rotator and the reason for that is if we posited and hit play it's going to have time to kind of load everything in and then it's not going to lag right in the beginning gears you can see now much move the movement and that actually looks pretty good speed wise you can of course mess around with that so now we need to add an on trigger method that will kind of see if we've collided something check for a collision and if we have we're going to go ahead and we'll stop the pin right there because then we've hit our rotator and we want to parent it to a rotator so that it will both follow the rotators rotation so now if you go into visual studio will create a void on trigger enter 2d and we of course want to gather a bit of information about what we hit um so we'll go up here and say we want to have some information about our 2d collider that we hit we call this information coal and will say that if cold tag is equal to rotator so if whatever we hit has a tag of rotator then we can of course know that we should be pinned so we we've hit the circle and we want to stop our forward movement we want to parent it and everything is good so yeah so let's go up here and create some kind of private boolean and we will call this something like is pinned and will default that to false and we only want to move forward if we append so we're going here and say if we are not pinned so if is not pinned we will move our position this way to stop us from moving forward forward all we have to do is say is pinned equals true there we go so now we should actually stop moving and we should be able to see the effect of this immediately of course we need to pause it here and you can see that once we hit the circle it just stops so that's awesome the next thing that we need to do is also parented to a rotator and we don't need a reference to a rotator because if the tack or if the colliders tag is equal to rotator that means that our collider is indeed the rotator and so we can just go and say transform strands one dot set parent and the parent that we want is set it to is the cold dot transform there we go and it's actually that easy it's pretty impressive so now we can just say play again I'm just going to pause it right off the bat here to make sure it there's no lag then we can stop and you can see we already have the basic game mechanic in place it's going to hit the thing and rotate around with it so yeah really fun and easy thing to do cool so I'll just have a look in the chat here to see if everything's good hello everyone just joining that's awesome I think we are breaking like viewer rickets or something right now that's so much fun I'm really happy to see all of you guys in here um you're gonna have a lot of fun we only just just getting started no really that's it this is like most of it but don't I couldn't say that ignore that part stay tuned for the most awesome part which is probably the end screen actually that is really fun anyways I'm getting sidetracked here so so now we are kind of able to control our pin moving forward and we are able to kind of pin it to our circle but we still need to be able to spawn these at will so to do that we'll go back into unity and we'll kind of create a prefab out of this pin but let's actually also have a small graphic you displaying from where we're going to shoot this pin so let's just duplicate it and let's remove the sphere and let's also just make I kind of disabled this previous pin just for a second here let's rename this to something like pin spawn point and we can maybe bump down the Alpha a tiny bit something like that looks a bit better we can remove the collider the rigidbody the script is just going to be an empty object just a tiny bit of graphics to let us know that this is where our pin will shoot from so now we can take our pin from before we can drag it down into the project and boom we have a prefab out of it so we can delete it from our scene now and we can go ahead and add some kind of spawner excuse me so the way we'll do this is selectively in spawnpoint will hit add component and will create a spawner so that's double click that to open it up in Visual Studio and buying bang bang you're going to open reload all like an open come on there we go so in here we of course now need a reference to our prefabs that will create some public game object we're going to call this one or pin three Pat will also create like um let's see what else are we going to need I think that's basically all we're going to need actually so let's just go ahead and create a board update method and in here we'll check if the user has pressed whatever fire button you want so we'll just go if input get button down and the button that we want to look for if you want it to be spaced you'll type in jump like this that befall to space in unity if you want to use the mouse you can use fire one I'm going to do that so that's the left click and it's going to fire and in here we'll do something like spawn pin and then we'll go ahead and create that method of course so that means in here we'll say void spawn pin and to spawn it all the do is say instantiate what we want to instantiate is the pin prefab where do we want to instantiate it well our current position so let's transform top position and with our current rotation so transform dot rotation and that's not transform it's transform there we go so save that and it should actually be that simple it's almost too good to be true but yeah should be fine so let's go ahead and now take our pin prefab drag it into the slot hit play and now we should be able to spawn these things yeah it's looking like a game look that's awesome of course you have no way of dying yet and we have no score so it's a very boring game but it is a game I can see that everything looks to be a bit too far up so we'll just take our rotator and spawn point here and move both of them down a little bit something like that is probably going to be better we want it to be pretty close to the same in order to create the best effect I think and ways of making this harder is of course making this more narrow the larger you make it the more room there is you can also move this point here further away from the circle or make them shoot at a lower speed there's lots of stuff that you can adjust in order to vary the different levels or you can simply make it rotate faster which is always going to be more difficult so lots of fun variables that you can tweak here I mean we could just go ahead and move our spawn point here all the way down here and it's going to be much harder to time I say that and then I'm a god oh I hit that one yeah I was going to get cocky someone knew I was going to do that why can't all right so that's kind of beyond the base mechanics and then it's just about checking for your coalition doing an end screen and of course we also kind of want to vary the rotation a bit because right now it's just moving at a constant thing so um yes since I was a water have a look at the chat and for those of you I'm asking general questions I will go ahead and have a Q&A at the end of the stream so just hold on to those for just a moment and yeah did you do every time you stick a pin in it it speeds up that's super easy to do every time you shoot it spins the opposite way that's just as easy to do all you really need to do for this is just one inside of our pin script here we can now go ahead and access the rotator script so we can just go Cole dot getcomponent and then get the rotator component here and then we can modify the speed variable directly so we could like say add 50 on to that and now it's going to move 50 degrees faster per second per pin so you can see here oh that's going to speed up quickly it's probably a bit too hard and if we wanted to like um if you wanted to make it move into the opposite direction we would simply do a times equal negative one so now we should be able to just slip it I believe my math and programming is correct here yeah there you go hey that's actually really fun it's a good one it confuses my brain so there's just so many ways to really really easily configure this I'm just going to go ahead and remove that because I have some other things planned with the speed that I'm going to show you in a sec which is really cool but first let's let's go ahead and create kind of the end screen thing also someone asks what's the meaning of the f' after the numbers so putting an f' after a number simply indicates that this number is a float and in most context this is not really going to matter for example here public float speed equals 20 we could just go ahead and remove the the F there and we've already written float so it knows that it's a float but some methods might need it if you're saying 20 / this is a bad example 3 divided by 2 now right now this is actually an integer division and that means this is going to come up with a whole number it's going to force it into a whole number but if we go and put an F here on these two numbers it's going to come up with a decimal place number so it's just a good habit of always putting an F whenever you want to deal with decimals just always do it and it's always going to work if you only do it sometimes you are eventually going to run into problems so that's why I'll just instantly put an F there cool yeah so yes that's great the end screen so in order to do that we need to register if we hit another pin and to do that we can simply mark our different pins with a tag and then inside of our ontriggerenter method check for that tag so first we check if the on tag is equal to rotator and then we can say else if so if it's if it's not equal to rotator we want to check if called that tag is equal to pin for example and then if it is well then we want to go ahead and end the game so we can create some kind of endgame mechanic here for now we'll just go ahead and through our debug the dog saying something like and game just to see if this is working then what we can do is go into unity here take our pin go to tag hit add tag add a new tag called pin and we're just going to add that here you don't want to change the speed there's really no reason to do that just a pin so now we can go ahead and hit play and we should see that if we hit two pins on top of each other boom it's going to say end game and it actually did that three times which I'm not sure why that's kind of weird so I see why it's doing it two times because both objects are going to be checking for it but three times this is a little weird might be just some coincidences for the way that it might be because these colliders are actually checking for it as well if we go ahead and and Mark are our spear here as a non trigger are well then it's not really going to yeah it's not going to work so but this is actually not too important well it does it one time or three times because we'll just implement some way of checking if the game is already ended and if it has we won't end it again sort of say so we'll just add a small mechanic there it's super simple so we won't worry about that but instead of ending the game in here it's better to separate it out in a game manager and to do that let's just go in here and let's put it on the main camera we could also put it on a separate object and we'll rename or name the script game manager and we'll double click it and this is going to be a very simple script really all it's going to do is the actual game ending so this is also where you would probably transition to a new level but in our case we'll just have some public void called end game and for now we'll just again throw a debug the log statements in here saying end game and we can call this through the script but of course you only want to do that one so in here we'll just create a private poll saying something like game has ended said that to default to false by default then in here we check if game has ended if it has we're just going to return out that method and not do anything else and if it has not has not will say well now the game has indeed ended so that will make sure that we'll only call this once then inside of our pin in order to access that method we could create a reference by using some kind of single singleton pattern and I do recommend you do that I should actually make a video on Singleton's now that I'm thinking about it but until then bear with me that's plenty of resources for creating Singleton's but a much easier way is just using fine object of type we want to find the game manager and then going dot endgame there we go super fast not as performant but really only going to be doing this once per I wait for a single frame and then the game is going to be start so it's totally alright so we'll just go in here and hit play and we should see now that we can end the game but only one so let's try this ah there we go so you see only one ingame call and no matter how many times they're doing now it's not going to work cool that's exactly what we wanted to do so the next thing is are disabling our rotator and spawner so that our circle stops rotating and so that we can't put in any more pins after the game is ended and the way to do that is well we just need a reference to those objects and we can disable them super easily so let's create a public rotator and call this one rotator let's also create a public spawner and call this one spawner and all we need to do when we end the game instead of writing a debug that log statement will say rotator dot enabled equals false and spawner dot enabled equals oh cool so that should pretty much be it and now we of course need to reference these so let's put in a rotator put in our pin spawn point and hit play and now we should see that if we go ahead and lose the game here bone everything stops and I can't click anymore the game isn't past it's still playing at the same time so that's awesome so we can still do cool animations or whatever we want to do GUI or whatever but there's no more real gameplay going on because our 2 gameplay controlling scripts are both or disabled awesome so the next thing that I wanted to show you is how you can display a cold animation that makes this feel a lot better because just stopping the game and then restarting it it's not too rewarding you want even though losing the game sucks if you want to leave how to have it suck in a cool way something that maybe swims in on the action lets you know what you did wrong maybe emphasizes on the motion and then restarts it so always make sure to give you a player really clear feedback on what's happening in the game especially on things that he could improve on so let's go ahead and create a public animator and this is because whenever we want to play an animation we need a reference to the animator and then on down here we'll go ahead and play something on that animator so we'll go animator dot set trigger and we haven't created this trigger yet but basically we'll create a trigger called something like and game there we go so let's go ahead and actually create this so you can see now of course on our main camera we now need a reference to the animator in order to do that let's create an animator and in order to create an animator we can just create an animation and the animator will be created for us so let's select the main camera and let's hit create a new animation if you don't have the animation window you can always go a window and then our animation there control six and hit create and let's actually make a new folder for this just a tiny bit organized call this one animation and let's called the atom itself something like idle or default or start or whatever and this is just going to have our default settings in our case that's going to be a kind of white sky box and let's create a pre for if a key frame with that you know what to do that I simply move forward my timeline a tiny bit I change it to a different color and I remove that keyframe and you can see it's created a keyframe down here with our beginning with our start settings so that's awesome we can also just move the size a bit here and we'll set it back to 5 and now those two things are now keyframed with a default of 5 and this whitish color then we can create another animation clip and this one will called ingame and in here we can go ahead and change the color so we'll do kind of a purplish red make it a bit more red than that something like that is it's kind of because that they use in the game and will also swim in on it so we'll have a size of something like 2.4 something like that just to cut off the spawn point here and really focus on what's going on with the circle and that looks a lot better I think and then what we can do is we can kind of scrub through the animation and then add say the zero thirty point here we can go ahead and move out the side so we'll just have it kind of zoom out again I think that's going to the code so we'll have something like that yeah that looks pretty neat and we can just go ahead and stop recording and of course right now we haven't created a transition between the two animations but the really cool thing about unities making them is that once you're adjusting parameters like this it'll just go ahead and blend them nicely on its own so it will actually go ahead and create a nice transition from our idle which looks like this to our end game which is like this without us touching anything so that's super cool so all we need to do in order to enable that is select our main camera go to the animator window and the animator is again found on a window and then animator and you need to make sure that your default our animation here is idle if the animations aren't in here you can just go ahead and drag them in like that I'm just going to delete that and if it's not set to default you can always right click and hit set layer as default state and you can see it turning orange so let's do that to our idle let's rightclick hit make transition and um of course we don't want this to transition immediately we only wanted this to transition whenever a condition is met that condition being whenever the trigger endgame is set remember in our code we recalled set trigger and then we specified endgame so all we need to do now is go under our parameters here add a new trigger and call that one end game and make sure that you spell it the exact same way also with capital letters and stuff like that or it's not going to work then for a transition here we go ahead and add a new condition and make sure that you select the end game condition so now whenever this is triggered it's going to transition to the end game however right now it's going to wait for idle to finish its animation so let's just go ahead and click this and then disabled has exit time let's also take our end game animation and disable loop time because we don't want that to loop we only want it to play once now we should actually already be able to hit play go select our main camera and now in our animator just trigger it and you can see the animation playing and just how cool that looks however we of course also trigger this through script so let's just go ahead and hit play through the script here and now once we hit two of these together of course we need to also assign the animator so we'll just drag in the animator right there so we needed to do that's why we got in all your friends exception so let's try that one more time let's go ahead and die here and you can see how cool that looks actually wanted to zoom it out a bit more I think so that's going to our end game and game here have a kind of transition for a bit longer and it's also set the sides actually maybe just back to 5 I think it's going to look pretty cool let's see what that looks like and you can see just how easy it is to adjust the settings on this I think that looks really cool actually but I do want it to be faster I think 030 arm works better so I will just stick to that and as always spend more time on this stuff than I do so I'll take a sip of water now before I kill my voice completely let's have a look in the chat how are you guys doing um let's see why not stream on YouTube instead of twitch well I've considered streaming on YouTube because well I have a lot more followers there um and the thing is I really liked which I think twitch is just really nice I really like the community here and like a lot of the features I'm not a big fan of YouTube streaming features but if none of you guys want me to I definitely just go ahead and stream on YouTube it's it's not me who should decide it really so it's it's up to the people I guess and of course I always upload the video to YouTube as well so kinda doesn't make a difference because you'll get the video anyways but yeah just not reasoning on that uh yeah everything else is saying looking good awesome so um now that we have these gameplay elements in place it's really just about kind of finetuning it one thing that you would definitely want to do is as soon as we end our game and the animation stops playing we want to transition to either a new scene or the same scene in our case we just want to restart the level the player has failed and we want him to know that you could also go ahead and display the score here you could make him I don't know we try a different level to say high scores something like that we'll just go ahead and restart to see in order to do that let's go into our game manager and let's create another public method so public void and we'll call this something like restart level and all we need to do remember to restart a level is make sure that we have unity engine dot scene management included and then we need to go scene manager dot load scene and the scene we want to load is are currently active scene and we get that by saying scene manager dot get active scene and then dot build index whoops there we go so that should actually restart our level however we still need to call that function at the appropriate time one way would be to go in here and create a Co routine that waits X amount of settings before restarting the level so that we give the animated time to play but a better way is using a Unity animations events so Unity animation events basically allows us to specify any time during an animation whether it's created in unity or imported from some 3d modeling software where we want to UM call a function and in our case that's going to be right at the end where our animation has stopped playing to add an event simply set your timeline or your marker here to wherever you want to add it and then click the add event and then you can select the event here and change settings on it in our case we want to select the restart level function and you can see that this is accessible because it sits on the same object that are animated does make sure that it does that so now that we've selected this function unity should actually take care of everything for us so we can just go ahead and no put a few pins in this and boom it's going to reset the level and you could create some kind of cool fading whatever you want to do with that is totally up to you you can maybe have all of the pins like fly out and then back in but it's yeah we have that finished map cool so um yeah um let me see here I'm sorry I got distracted some motion going on over here my cats are crazy so yeah the next thing is probably just the rotation here because right now it's constant and that allows us to basically just play the game and then just sit and click away and we have a perfect stack of pizza that's actually kind of beautiful did you guys see that I'm really proud of this one I think I'm going to go ahead and take a screenshot look it's perfect it's the perfect circle like the distance between these are what's the odds let's go ahead and say that this is like a math teachers dream like here and I'm going to go ahead and mess it up there we go so this is of course way too easy so what we'll do instead is go onto our rotator and of course you can control our speed here in different ways we could I do have it as I showed earlier on the stream increase every time you put a pin in something we would have it kind of switch direction you could also control it using a unity curve or using some kind of coding where you suddenly switch some or some kind of time variable where in certain intervals you're going to switch the speed whatever there's plenty of opportunity for this but I found the easiest one and it's actually pretty fun the easiest one is to use the animator to click to edit or speed variable because one thing that a lot of people don't realize or easily forget is that the unity animation system can actually edit variables that you've created yourself and the cool thing about this is that we can now go here hit create animation go into our animation window and we can call this once a rotator but you can also make this easily into different levels this is the way that you would be able to very easily create different levels and we have this called level one have that play a certain animation then in level two you'll play another animation and you can just keep going so but this is going to be a rotator because we only have a single level and only need to do is in the beginning here we'll set the speed to something like a hundred then we can move forward say I don't know how long maybe a second or so we can we need to copy those keyframes over here something like that and we can actually have it speed up a little bit let's do that and in here we'll set the speed to something like 200 we can then copy these keyframes again and right before the two second mark we're going to make them go back here so we take this keyframe move over there this keyframe move back and move this at one two two second mark another arm I don't think we need any EC eating in or eating out on this one let's see what it looks like in the inspector or of course you can really see this on this way in the game so let's just go ahead and preview this actually lets the play put a pin in it and yeah that works and it brokes works really well you can see the reason why this went a bit further is again because we're using unity ordinary collision system and that might have a bit of error the only reason why it went that far is because again I shot it right after playing and unity always does weird stuff right when playing the game so just make sure to pause it and then play and they will all be on at the same place here so that's basically it I mean that allows you to just so easily go in here and edit the speed over time you can even go in and change the curve in order to adjust it if we wanted one that just increases a whole lot and then suddenly decrease it that could also be really fun to do so really really easy to control this sort of stuff using the animator so final thing is displaying the scores so let's go ahead and do that that's right click go UI and then text and we can just focus on this text here right now this canvas here is on just an overlay canvas and it's huge and we could just position our text to kind of line up with our circles but I think a much better way is making this into a world canvass so let's select the canvas change the render mode to world space and we can now scale it down because it's well gigantic so let's do something like point zero 1.0 1.0 one thats also reset the position on the X and the y it'd have to focus on that and you can see it's a lot better already then we can kind of maybe scale it down here because we don't need it to be that detailed and in kind of Center it on our on our circle here just moving it up on the Y then we can take our text object hit the anger presets here hold down alt and click in the bottom right corner in order to snap it to the entire arm to fit the entire canvas and we can then Center it on the X and on the Y we can change the text to something like one we can bump up the font size to something like 100 change the color to white and I don't like the fog I have to say I don't like the Arial fund I don't know why it's the default one in unity it's probably because well like all operating systems have has it and uses it but I don't like it I would prefer something like the latter fund something like to tell young text put Roboto would be pretty cool here just anything but Arial really pathetic I would actually do fine here or you could do with some something more classic anyways we can no doubt with the fonts forever but yeah just put anything else really and yeah but now we have the scores and I just colored picked it to fit the background instead of being completely white just so things feel a little better people of course spawning a spamming comic sense in the chat here I'm not going to do that I refuse and yeah so that looks good so then we're going to rename this texture to score we can go ahead and create a new component and we'll just name this our score component then inside of that will or doubleclick it to open it up first of all and in here we can create a static variable so we'll create a public static integer and this means that it's shared by all instances and so it's really easy to edit without needing in a reference to this particular object so we'll create public static int and we'll name it something like pin count and we'll set it to zero by default we'll also go down and create a start method in which we set the pin count to zero and that means that you don't have to default it up here but it's really important that you do this in the start method because when we restart the scene static variables are not reset and so you would just keep on counting and adding up on the score so make sure it's always reset that in the start method or when the level was noted or whatever that will go on into the update here and this is where we'll update our text so in order to do that we need to include unity engine dot UI then we can create a reference to our text so we'll create a public text object name that text then down here we can said text dot text in order to change the text of our text object equal to on pin count dot two strings boom there we go that was quick coding and then we can go into our pin whoops I pinch the pin so we'll select the pin here and in here we can say other than is pinned equals true and all that if we hit the rotator we can go ahead and set score oops score pin count to one to be one bigger so we'll just increase that by one and we do that by writing plus plus so everything else should work and if I haven't messed this up and we remember to import our text here if we now hit play and I'm confident enough to do this in full screen guys that means that it's getting good we have a counting score and if we die it resets it's almost too good to be true I think that was it so at this point I think I'm just going to go ahead and invite my lovely girlfriend you guys know who has Sophie bub you've probably seen her as a moderator in the stream onto the stage which is pretty much just a part of our living room and she can try it out so come here say hi we also have a cat click oh hi guys say hi this is Charlie guys oh it's really tired right now how's it going yeah welcome so thank you so let's just try yeah go ahead ok it's already playing oh yeah what's the reason for the wrist yep like so much as this game yeah is going to be an embarrassment I just know you can do it I can really mess you up but just being controlled actually I think that's an alternate yeah that's another key that's why I'm really amazed at how best you may excellent thanks yeah about an hour I guess yeah it's awesome I mean is really smooth yeah as long as it's over ten minutes we get enough ad revenue haha kidding so how much you things like the average number of pimp I don't know uh I think more than you are doing right now trollee yeah cool you like it it's really fun it has a great feel to it I think yeah right it is quite similar to the original yeah so I guess that's a good thing yeah okay we were aiming for yeah what is originality guys originality instead we're just doing the same things over and over anyway yeah I like it yeah awesome go sit over there yep so um they are asking if you're interested in making games or coding you can go ahead and take my microphone um yes I actually am but I also do quite a bit of editor work for ESCA um about editing the videos and just helping out on the back end of the YouTube channel yes it's been really awesome lately she's had a lot more time to help me out with the videos and I don't know if you guys have noticed but we have it we edit the videos a lot more heavily than we used to now and it's just so great because I can just throw her like the raw files and she actually does a lot of it so they are props to her so but yeah we've been doing some programming together it's it's really really fun it's a it's a it's a great thing to do together but yeah let's transition to the Q & A so let's let's go here and I'll do this and everything looks broken and there you go all right guys ask away let's uh I think we can be pretty happy about that thanks for the compliments guys you guys Rock we are yeah we've broken like the record switch viewer amount by far but that's awesome bye you guys so much I'm glad you liked this video how long since we met each other um well we've been together for I'm going to get this wrong and our four over five and a half years I think something like that we we made like in a eighth grade or something like that long time ago so yeah let's see um how did I start on ingenuity I wanted to make a game I guess um probably how much most people start had some good ideas I thought the the iOS app market was really interesting at the time I really don't anymore and I wanted to create kind of a a small game maker app actually and that's kind of how I picked opportunity because creating small sandboxes that are easy to tweak variables and them stuff is really easy within unity so again and I just kind of got in cept me obsessed with it is my cat a developer also not not yet we're getting there treating him some tricks he thinks he is sometimes you would you would think so at least considering the amount of times he walks over my keyboard and write something but most of the time it's pretty nonsensical you didn't miss the stream this is the best part of the stream this is where we hang out man but of course it will be up on on YouTube as well so don't worry about it then you can watch it immediately ask you on Detroit archives let's see you are going to upload another episode of how to make a video game in unity soon yeah and don't worry about it I mean this video is going to come out later today and the Han Omega video game is probably going to come out this wooden state remember I although Wednesdays and Sundays like every time and I try and make a how to make a video game video like every other week and then the other arm days I will kind of fill in with the standalone video something that I feel are some you guys have suggested most of the time and something that I feel would be interesting to do how did you get the visual studio solarized color scheme it's actually called mono kai and I just made a video actually on my visual studio settings my unity setting some cool tips and stuff a lot of you guys asked about that after the il10 unity tips video and it's going to air in a few weeks so they all basically get my entire setup but I can throw your link closing wait if you just bear with me I'm going to show you a link in this twitchchat here to my visual studio settings because I've already I've already uploaded them so I think I should be able to do that pretty easily so bear with me while I try and figure this out so there we go something like this my keys settings lip I think yeah so if you guys just want to get all of my visual studio settings it's on the link right there you can just download that open it up you get to go um so let's see could you do a video about the unity animator it is confusing you a lot and I don't quite get everything in it yeah I understand that um the animator is pretty confusing it's actually a good idea I would love to do like a unity animated standalone video I'm going to have to write all this video that ideas down at some point I do but I can't really sit here write them down during the stream actually it's my live stream I can do what I want are going to write it down right away because I think it's a really good idea so I'm just going to do animator video but yeah the unity animator can be super confusing once you first start out I remember when unity first launched mekkin mi was so confused and some of the naming is just weird but once you get into it it's just it's crazy good I mean the ability to retarget animation as long as it's a human a model that somewhat fits their kind of rigging scheme it's just so powerful I mean you can have multiple different characters with using the same animations and you just swap things in and out and it's so easy to preview all that it's just it's amazing and it's also a really powerful state machine can you please teach us how to save and load your unity game I already have a few videos on serialization where we use player press but saving like an entire game state is totally going to depend on your game and I can see my which can kind of screwing around the kind of colors there you'll have to bear with that but yeah you can check some of those out to search for unity player prep it's probably the best place to start it's my income mostly YouTube or twitch or do you make games my income is definitely mostly YouTube not at all to it I switch I don't get anything from this whatsoever if you want to support me and these live streams you should go to patreon.com/scishow so it's patreon.com slash Trekkies it allows you to donate a monthly amount of your choosing and basically all of these guys goes into making these videos making live streams like this I spend a ridiculous amount of time considering my monthly payment I mean if I just had a fairly low hourly rate I would be a millionaire consider much time I spend on this stuff but yeah if you want to support it that's the way to go I don't make a lot of money elsewhere so ah yeah we are getting some patron hype in the chat that's awesome I'm just going to throw you guys a link to that as well so Gretchen calm slash varieties there you go if you go ahead and click that the amount is totally optional it's a monthly thing you can cancel it at any time I do have a few rewards and mostly it's just socializing it's so fun talking with the patrons and I'm getting to know you guys a bit better it's just awesome also if you have some problems it allows me to help out a lot better because I just get way too many questions to answer all of them so I look at at patron first I don't have a twitch Partnership turns out in order to get a pittance which partnership you have to like stream at least two times a week and I don't do that and they really want you to stream daily almost so yeah I said they don't do no programming in C++ I know a bit of C code to us I don't feel very much at home also because C++ is just such an immense language and there's so many things you can screw up but I feel like I can and understand most of it and and write some of it so that's fun I have had a go at making a few graphics rendering engine since it does to us that is always fun to do where am i from Denmark and why your program in csharp instead of JavaScript in unity that's a super good question I mean before I think the answer was a lot harder and came down to more personal preference but I think as of late csharp is really starting to look like just the best option without much arguing the thing about JavaScript is that it's really easy to read and if you don't have any prior programming knowledge whatsoever a lot of the words used in JavaScript in that syntax come from English and not another programming language instead of void your X function and things can have a function and realize instead of writing float goals in whatever instead of writing the datatype explicitly you simply write bar for variable and it's good to learn what a variable is and stuff like that so it's not as explicit and that's simply also just less syntax you start without a class you start our namespace and stuff like that so it's just cleaner in terms of reading it but I think csharp just is superior in unity at this point and it's because you want that explicitness if you're making it a larger game and also if you go on the forums if you go on to the unity scripting reference or the API whatever on the manuals all the examples pretty much you're going to be seeing up from C sharp and it just helps you so much also if you're going to be programming in a more professional setting they're probably like 99.9 percent of the time going to be using C sharp to do that so that's why it's good to learn and that's why I also use it also I love csharp it's just I love that language something about it I don't know let's see unity 4 vs. Unreal Engine 4 in your opinion totally depends how big is your team what game is you are you making if you are less than 45 people always unity if you're making something other than a big shooter with really advanced graphics I'm pretty much always going to turn to choose unity if those two requirements are in place then I really start to think about it that's just my personal thing but really both awesome engines really and you can create amazing games of all types using both hmmm you some of you guys asking kind of what programming languages are better JavaScript csharp C++ just with the game engines it solely depends on what you want to do guys it's way too general of your question of a question you can say which one is better performance wise at this particular task and then we can start to talk about it but just comparing to programming languages that it's it's just too general it's just like tools yeah I mean what's best a screwdriver or a hammer well it kind of depends on if you want to knock something into the wall or screw it in so let's see when did you start programming um slowly about they mess it up six years ago something like that yeah ceelo's now do I know any AI stuff yeah do I have written a bit of custom artificial intelligence plugins just for my own using nothing pretty um I've used a star pathfinding for love projects it's really good I've also used a bit of rain from rain Indy from rival series so yeah a bit here and there that's not the video that I should probably go ahead and do soon it's some kind of a star path finding /ai video and it's now on the list as well when I make a video explaining navmesh navigation on basically a navigation mesh is a mesh that you generate for your game where are basically an overview of where your artificial intelligence object is able to walk so you just create a mesh that avoids obstacles you have certain paths there might be links between jumps and stuff like that and that allows your it allows your artificial intelligence agent whatever you want to navigate around to not have to think about all this stuff he knows where you can walk and where he can't that's what nav meshes are but that is something that I would cover for doing and they I video probably let's see what else we have here I keep struggling working on a game because I think my scope is too big ah it went off the screen here wait let me just find the chat here wait no this is here we go the chat is going way too quick guys I started yeah it keep struggling working on a game it keeps disappearing I can't do it I'm sorry whatever the question is just it's going too fast I couldn't find it I'm so sorry did you use roblox in your childhood or ever actually did not which computer language should I learn and I don't know what these last oh hi yeah awesome okay yeah the programming language that it completely depends on your on your background if you're just starting out and you want to use unity csharp or JavaScript if you feel that C shock is too scary to JavaScript if you want to jump right into the hardcore stuff csharp and yeah pretty much depends on what you want to do if you want to learn something about the web there's so many languages probably start with HTML and a bit of CSS and then from there you can go to JavaScript to make your code interactive and then you can have a look at if you want to go to front face developers or back in developers but yeah really depends on what you want to do um let's see could I make it to turn on how to make GTA in unity I love Grand Theft Auto but I don't want to be making it that would take me alone and internally and even in a team that's way too hard so no I won't be doing that so we're too complicated what's my favorite games flash games that's a good question actually I feel like I've played a lot of different games when it comes to like smaller indie games um I think Thomas Thomas was alone this is really really good I played so many it's hard some of the big Triple A games I've already always been a huge fan of Ratchet and Clank mostly because of their humor the cutscenes some of the character work the art is amazing the gameplay is fine but I mean the level design is just amazing really really good work I also like the casual shooter I played a lot of close duty back in the day modern warfare 2 I have like 600 600 hours in that and I've played a lot of counterstrike I love csgo and all that it's really fun to do with friends I've said a huge amount of World of Warcraft the old Warcraft games were super fun yeah I've really played a lot of different games but I consider myself mostly a social gamers so most of what I've played is something that has played great friends and then once in a while an indie experience um probably is the only really big game other than Ratchet and Clank that was singleplayer on the PC is Skyrim i played the heck out of Skyrim just amazing world building really really well put together engine and game have a little played League of Legends over the 4 craft I played League of Legends like a few times I sucked so bad at it I rage quit I actually prefer smite if you're going to go in kind of the mobile direction I both suck at odor and League of Legends but yeah it's light a lot of World of Warcraft definitely way too much can you do more mobile tutorials well I actually try and aim most my tutorials on games that can easily be exported to either mobile or desktop I don't want to narrow it down too much unity makes it so easy to export stuff for both platforms and that's why I've tried and keep it really general of course you have to worry about performance and of course you need to have different controls so that's just such a tiny part of your game that I try not do that too much I might make a mobile series at some point but I think most people are requesting all those tiny little stuff but I'll definitely keep it in mind do did you do to you can I do another multiplayer FPS tutorial well this is something that I wanted to address both the multiplayer FPS series and the tower defense series are currently on hold the reason why is that I've again transition to a whole new way of making videos for me at least and I know this is a pretty drastic change and I'm sorry if you guys are disappointed to not see more videos in it right now the reason why is I saw a lot of you guys saying in the comments that you felt like this series was getting too long and you wanted to see all the topics and it was getting kind of boring also you were missing videos because you you got lost at video number 15 and never got to number 30 and I felt like I was covering the same things over and over but in a slightly modified way to fit that particular series and I thought that could be just done just so much better but what I do instead now is um try and make more standalone videos that cover a certain subject that you can then easily apply to whatever game you're working on so if you're making a multiplayer FPS or a tower defense you can hopefully apply a shattering effect or a whatever volumetric lighting something like that something standalone that you can easily just take and implement in your game I feel that's a lot better I've definitely seen a lot more views on those videos a lot more likes you guys seem a lot more engaged with those videos and of course that means that we can't go ahead and create these huge game projects but I mean in the end only like four or five times 5,000 people were watching those videos where in the beginning some of those series videos have hundreds of thousands of views so it really showed me that I'm doing something wrong here I'm not really captivating and keeping people watching these videos so yeah that's kind of why I've transition to this more standalone field um does that mean that I never will make another multiplayer FPS video not necessarily and the same thing with tower defense but I have to do something that I really feel is it's needed and necessary and I don't just want to sit there and grind out the same boring video again and again I want to make smaller videos and standalone videos so I hope you guys aren't bored with that so far the feedback I think has been really positive and I'm just so thankful for that because this is also so much more fun to me why am i underrated thank you so much as anyone ever hide you in the game industry yeah I've been hired to do client work um many times I haven't actually ever been in a fulltime game developer on position for a game studio and the reason for that is in very much not that I can that I haven't been offered it especially since the YouTube channel it's gotten better bigger I've done a lot of offers because people recognize me and know that I'm kind of what I can do and such but I just really like this a lot more I don't like the idea of having a ninetofive job and also I wouldn't be able to keep score with the YouTube channel and you guys and patreon and dev assets and all these things so I really hate having to do that at this point I enjoy this so much more can I do if FPS tutorial series already have won the multiplayer first tutorial series you can go check that out we'll be doing some more shooter oriented standalone video want to do one on shooting definitely some weapon switching at some point I'm sorry for just delaying it and delaying it but I have something that I want to get in place before showing you yeah so would you make a unity photon game photon is awesome maybe at some point where did I they learn a step past finding my enemies get start the in platforms just using that documentation actually but that can be kind of tricky to figure out if you don't have too much experience just learning you a ice and stuff alright new AP ice and stuff like that so yeah but there are some really good tutorials on YouTube actually just search for unity a star path finding tutorial and lots of great stuff is that especially it Sebastian League has done a lot with artificial intelligence all right I think we're going to do final questions here guys because my voice is slowly disappearing and I can't be clutch more so um yeah just shoot shoot in the twitch chat and we'll do this some final ones and we'll wrap up this was just so much fun will you do an advanced tutorial depends on if there's a subject that I really want to cover so yeah sure if a final good good subject um would you suggest a guy that can do good programming an art to go indie or try to get work in a company for an entrylevel position totally depends on your situation if you go indie and try that out that can be really financially unstable whereas working in a bigger studio you have benefits so depends on what you want to do personally I would always prefer to do indie development with smaller teams if you have friends so we can get to know someone who want to make a game similar to what you want but of course that's always risky and you can never be guaranteed that people will actually buy it in the end you'll you need to have a good strategy before considering doing that because yeah financially that can be hard but that's always what I would aim for but when these sort of always take my advice with a grain of salt these sort of things because it totally depends and I don't just occur to you to go out and make an indie game and then after two years go broke tell me that hold am i I am 19 years old soon to be 20 fairly soon like a month or so little over month huh please stop spamming questions I'll just go ahead and answer now so you can stop spamming please stop anyways have you considered making and selling a game for extra income sure that could be a lot of fun but right now I suddenly have too much to do with YouTube channel I also launched dev assets of course if you guys want some cool 3d models for free is pay what you want go to devices comics aside I made together with some awesome artists and that's kind of the development project that I've been working on alongside the YouTube channel so I haven't really had time to think of it but at some point that would be that would be really fun but making a game and selling it does require a lot of a lot of work and when it's my birthday on 25th of March it's my birthday birthday often do you live stream these live streams are monthly thanks to patreon because we reach the monthly live streams go but yeah sometimes they go a few days overboard how do you expand coding knowledge fast practice just right and when I subtract this I don't mean keep writing on the same big project make lots of smaller projects like this one no it creates something that you know you're going to be able to finish in a day an hour a week not more than that and create that and then move on to the next thing the more smaller projects that you create the more you get to know and yeah it's really just about coding yourself into a wall then hitting that brick and just realizing that's something I have to learn hearing aware to keep going and then learning it I think that's pretty much the best way if you're already familiar with coding like the basics and able to code on your own yeah how am I and good thank you how are you and yes the livestream is going to get up go on YouTube and how unlikely is it to make money off your first game your very first game that's very unlikely and the thing that most indie developers do is they build up a bank of games and if they get more and more recognition each time and and and more and more revenue for each game in the bank and they of course you have to support the older games but it's very rare to be able to live off of a single release most people have at least three four five six games released that day then I live off of that's at least what I see is common in the industry for for standalone developers working in smaller teams so yeah all right guys I think that is pretty much it so thank you so much for the questions you guys Rock I had so much fun as always if you wanted to put these on live streams and these videos go to patreon.com slash blankies and if you want to download some cool looking models go to demo sitcom and of course go to youtube.com slash brackets if you want to see more videos lots of them more much more heavily edited than this one thankfully because I say a lot of crap and we have to clean that out and yeah so thanks so much guys had a blast you guys Rock and yeah I'll see you in the next video so bye guys thank you so much five thanks to the awesome people who donated in January and a special thanks to Derek since Kirk placed on mattify james callaghan robert Bonham Peter Locke and Jason dirty dough if you want to become a picture in yourself you can do so a pitcher intercom slash brekkie thanks a lot guys
