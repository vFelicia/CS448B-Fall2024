so once again I managed to miss out on Luna Marais which of course made me very sad but I guess I don't really have anyone to blame except for my own poor planning however in true game gem spirit I refuse to be discouraged and decided to make a game on my own I gave myself four days to work on the project whatever I managed to do in those four days I would make a video about hashtag no pressure now before we get into the video I quickly want to mention that we worked with the unity asset store to put together a bundle of my favorite unity assets in 2018 the bundle includes assets that have really helped me out as a developer over the years check out the bundle now and get a 33% discount on all the included assets using coupon code brackets best 2018 so recently I've been playing a lot of coop games with friends and one of our favorites is overcooked they work together or everything descends into complete madness cooking game I've also always been really fond of farming and sandbox games more specifically the relaxed atmosphere and cute graphics of games like stardew valley or even terraria so thought it might be fun to take this super relaxed vibe of these games and combine it with the horrible hell like stress of overcooked of course it's always a good idea to start by getting some thoughts down on paper so I called on Andreas and Thea to help figure out what gameplay mechanics a game like this should have I really recommend going through this stage with other people but because otherwise you might overlook a crucial aspect of the game but also because it helps you figure out what other people think would be fun to play the idea was simple every 40 seconds or so a truck arrives to pick up crops the two players have to work together to prepare as many crops as possible tending to them in various ways to avoid them from dying out at the top is a list of requested goods if the players load these goods onto the truck in the correct order they get bonus points now that might sound fairly straightforward but I quickly figured out that there are quite a few gameplay systems that need to work together for this game to be even playable my way to solve this do absolutely nothing except ignored and start with graphics so first I created a quick sketch to figure out the overall layout of the map when I had something that the somewhat coherent I started drawing out the different elements in Photoshop now I'm not much of an artist but I do think that it eventually turned out alright I did have to go back and change a lot of the graphics later though and then created a new unity project brought in all the sprites and said them using the time map editor however I quickly found that I felt constricted by trying to fit everything onto a grid and I wanted a lot of pieces like the truck and the players to be able to move freely so I actually scratched the tile map and decided to use freely moving sprites instead next up was player movement which was for once super simple in fact it took just about 2 minutes once the player at this stage the weirdlooking barrel was moving around the level I started working on the meat of the game crops I use scriptable objects to make it easy to create different types of crops in the editor and laid out the framework for how the player would interact with crops during the game to finish off the day I created some sprites for the first player as already told you my art skills aren't great I tried creating a hat but I ended up with mr. peanut next day I jump straight into player animation and added him to the game also created my first crop which was supposed to look like potatoes and replaced a large table with a bunch of smaller ones for keeping tools or goods now before planning a crop the plane needs to plow the ground so I added a plow tool that the player can pick up in use I also added seed barrels where the player could get seeds to plant in the dirt after planning a crop it has a growth value that increases over time once this value reaches one the crop changes to show that it's fully grown and the player can harvest it I used items to easily keep track of what state each crop is currently in at this point I realized I needed a way to show what the player was currently carrying so I created a tiny popup to display this I later used the same graphic to display which seeds was in which barrel and that was the end of day 2 what I forgot to mention that this happened so overall it was a success on day 3 it was pixel art time so I wrapped myself in a comfy blanket put on a good podcast and just started painting away and resin Thea also came up with the amazing idea that we should have less traditional crops like pizza noodles and hot wings that's just something really funny to me about having to plant a phone and water it to get a pizza at this point the game was kind of starting to come together and I started to feel like I might have something ready for the end of it of course there was still quite a few core pieces missing I programmed the truck to drive back and forth on schedule and made it so that the player could drop off crops and get points in return to display the crops on the truck I actually ended up using a UI canvas with a grid layout which work really well for this I then drew up the second player mr. Peanut's brother mr. pickle and implemented him as well I used the new prefab variation to give him the same functionality as the player but changing the graphics and key bindings with overrides at the end of day 3 I was able to remove a bunch of tasks from my todo list which felt really good and so finally day 4 was upon us and it was all about features first I implemented the system to keep track of requested goods are then displayed the score on the UI and I created a timer that would count down and show this green once the time was up and then programmed the watering mechanic yes I waited four days to do this and created a tiny icon that shows when a crop is close to drying out of course no watering mechanic is complete without a watering can so I made this hopeless attempt at one I also realized that if the crops actually died out the players needed a way to get rid of them so I quickly threw together a trash can where the players could dispose of unwanted crops finally andreas had this wonderful idea to create crows that would randomly target crops on the field and tried to eat them I thought this was genius because it adds a completely unexpected element to the game where players suddenly has to drop what he's doing and brush off to scare the crows away so without a performance care in the world I wrote some code I hope I will never have to look at again but somehow it worked without errors and it took only 35 minutes of course up until this point I had done little to no play testing which as I'm sure you all the thinking is normally incredibly stupid so at half past 500 in the evening we all sat down to play the game and we recklessly it worked and not only that it was actually fun i justed the amount of crows a bit and changed the timing between truck visits but with those simple changes the game felt complete we all went home to get a good night's sleep I was exhausted but really happy about the result the next day I wrote up the script for this video and now I'm talking into the microphone I'm starting to think that this might be a bit too meta but I'm also starting to think that I'm hungry let's just end the video here if you want to play the game I'll make sure to include a link to it in the description I'll also have a link to the source code in case you want to check that out and also don't forget to check out the asset store bundle now and get a 33% discount on all the included assets using the coupon code practice best 2018 on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks the awesome pitch and supporters who donated in december and special thanks to Francois ABBA and you can echo our darman John Shannon Alexander player in Finley PBR Sybok mommy sheriff Abdullah Chris Travis Dylan Shristi mr.
