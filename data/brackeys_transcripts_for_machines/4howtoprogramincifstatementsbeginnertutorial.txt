thanks for tuning in at brakus other one will come to video number four in the how to program in csharp course today we are going to be taking a look at what is called conditional logic or more specifically if statements so this will allow us to expand upon our program and teach it how to make decisions based on certain criteria and that really expands or really opens up on all kinds of different software that we can then write so this is really an important lesson cool so before we get started I just want to thank Daedalus or Daedalus for providing today's wallpaper it's super cool I've decided this thing called developer wallpapers where you guys can submit developer development or break is related designs and have a chance to get featured and also included in the HD wallpaper pack so whether or not you just want to download some cool wallpapers or you submit a cool design of viewers you should head over to break Easter calm slash wallpapers and you can download them here or check out the thread with where all of the designs of submitted and you can review those that didn't make it to the wallpaper pack cool so now that we have that out of the way let's head into Samaranch studio and I just quickly want to walk you through how I solved the challenge from the last video so I asked you to make a program that will divide two numbers and print out the result and here's what I come came up with I've added a bit of extra spice just to show you something cool called a goto so first off let's try and run this program and you can see that it asks for a numeral parently a number to be divided and we can type in 30 then it asks for a number to divide by and let's type in 5 and once we hit enter it says that 30 divided by 5 is equal to six but the cool thing here is that when we now hit any key it says you can see that it loops and again ask for a number to be divided so I've added this loop so what I've do done is is basically declare two int values I've written out that you should enter number and converted it to an int and all that and then written out the result down here which you can check out just type directly in here if you wanted to look exactly as si I've done it here just going to correct the error there and then what I've done down here is I've waited for the user to press a key using console that right rekey then I've made some empty space by using a an empty console dot write line so it's just going to make a new line and then I've used the go to you so basically up here I've written start and then a colon and that allows me to later in the code write go to and then start and then a semicolon to jump back onto up to that start statement up here so that will basically just loop the program I could also put this let's say down here and now whenever we go through this and do 30 and 5 and then hit enter you can see it just prints the result again because it just jumps back to the place where we print the result so you can put that different places in your code to make it easier on yourself one thing you will notice is that if we play this and do 3 divided by 2 it says that it's equal to 1 and we are pretty sure that that is not correct so what we can do is instead of using int which is integers meaning whole numbers we can do what is called a float or a double remember we talked about datatypes well a float or a double are basically decimal point numbers if load is pretty precise and the double is very precise so let's just for the fun of it use a double let's type double there and instead of in here we'll type double two then instead of convert 2.2 and 32 we'll do convert that to double and do the same down here convert that to double and then we should actually be able to divide uneven numbers so now when we hit play here or getting a decimal point result that's what I mean so when we enter your number let's do 3 divided by 2 you can say that the answer is 1.5 and this also allow us to maybe divide 12.5 by 2.3 and it will give us the exact results so now we can do pretty heavy calculations with this program cool so now let's a delve right into the subject of today which is if statements and we are going to write a program that asks the user how old he or she is and then write out things depending on the age so this is useful for gathering data or for checking the age of the user if you are say making a a game that has blood in it or just want to check for explicit content in general so let's do console dot write line and inside of this we're going to ask how old are you question mark and then on the next line we're going to make a integer called H because H is our rounded numbers and then we are going to equal this to convert dot to int 32 as we've done multiple times and then inside of these two parentheses we are going to type cons dot read line and then remember to open and close parentheses there also so nothing new here what we are then going to do is we are going to type if and then two parentheses like these but don't put a semicolon right here that's very important with if statements we don't put us in my colon and then inside of the the parentheses here is where we will put our condition so if H is less than this is the less than operator eighteen then we can do something I'm just going to show you the different conditional operators meaning the stuff we can check for so if H is less than then there's greater than then there's is equal to so really watch out that you have two equal signs whenever you are checking for something and one when when you're setting something equal to something else so this is is a if H is equal to eighteen then we have stuff like it's not equal to is less than or equal to or is more than or equal to okay so we're going to check if H is less than eighteen then we're going to open and close some curly brackets and inside of those everything that will happen if we meet our criteria will be put so just like we have a function and everything inside the curly brackets that belong to that function will be executed if that function is called and the main function is called when the program starts so that just means everything basically we have an if statement where everything inside of these two curly brackets will be executed if the criteria is met so here we're going to say console dot write line I'm you're going to write that's too bad you will have to wait a couple of years then after DF statement and this is where it becomes pretty cool we can do something if the criteria is not met and even better we can if the criteria is not met we can check for something else so we can do else which we'll just call the code if the criteria is not met or we can do else if where we can then check for another thing so we can check if H is then equal to 18 we can type our console dot write line and then here we can write peu barely mated and then here we can put an else statement so we don't want to check for anything and we can type console dot write line and then that final we can write you are allowed to enter so let me just show you how we can read through this oh actually we also have to put the whoops console dot read key just so our program won't quit let me just read through this so you know how to read these if statements allowed so we are writing a line to the console asking how old are you we're then collecting the age based on a console dot readline and converting it to an integer then we are asking if the H is less than 18 and if it is we write out this line if it's not we want to check if the H is equal to 18 and if it is we write out this line and if it's still not then we just do else meaning that if it's not below or equal to 18 this line will be called cool so now we can just go ahead and hit play to test this out how do I'm just going to write 17 that's too bad you still have to wait a couple of years and now we hit enter and the program closest you can of course also try let's say 18 it works and then we can try maybe 45 cool so that is how you do conditional logic you can make many different things using if statements just like this so the challenge for the next video is to create a small application where the user have to do solve math problems so what we will do is we will start out by creating two integer variables then we want to ask the user what is num1 divided by num2 just print it out then you want to collect the user sensor and store it in a variable then I want you to check if that is true and if it is right out that that's true and if it's not then right out you better try again so that's your challenge for the next video because once you have that in place I'm going to show you a very simple way to make that a little bit more fun cool so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video you
