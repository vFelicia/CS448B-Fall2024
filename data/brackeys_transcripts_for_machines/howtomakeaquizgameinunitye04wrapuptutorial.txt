thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to the fourth and final video on making a quit game in unity so it's already come time to wrap up this short series it's been a lot of fun and I've showed you pretty much what I wanted uh to show you from the beginning however there's still lots of stuff you can do to improve this game on your own the first thing that comes to mind for me is maybe adding some audio to the game so if that's something you're interested in I really suggest you check out the 2D platform of course which has a cool couple of videos on making an audio manager and adding some sounds to it and making them play so uh if if that's something you're interested in interested in uh definitely check that out so in this video we're going to be uh building a cool icon for the game we're quickly be H going to be hopping into Photoshop and sketching it out however you can use whatever program you want to and then we're going to set up some basic player settings and I'm going to show you how to quickly build this as a stand alone for either Windows and Mac if you want to uh go more in depth on how to publish your game stuff like um turning it into a uh setup file that you will run and then it installs on the computer and you have the ability to uninstall and all that or if you want to publish it to the internet and maybe upload it and all that stuff um well then I really suggest you check out video 25 to 26 in the mega Gameco um where I cover a lot of that stuff I really also want to make some uh Standalone video on how to export and some good techniques and all that so if that's something you want to see definitely let me know in the comments and I'll have a look at at creating some very generalized uh videos on that topic so that would be super fun without further Ado let's just dig right into today's video so you can see that I am uh here on my desktop and let's just open up Unity uh point 5.3.5 which is the U version I'm going to be using today so I've updated it a bit uh since we started and uh the first thing that I want to do here is uh maybe just clean up our project a little bit so let's just right click here and go on the create folder and U make a folder for our scripts let's select the game manager and the question and drag them under there and let's also make another folder and this is going to be our Sprite folder and whoops our Sprites folder and this is pretty much only going to host our uh game Icon then we can go under our main uh scene here just to make sure that everything looks and place as it should and we can just hit play here and see that everything is working so that's perfect and uh the first thing I want to do is go under the edit project settings and then player and uh this allows us to change all kind of stuff uh for how we export the game so the first uh thing we are able to do is change the company name and I'm going to change that to breis then we can also set select the product name and I'm going to rise write quiz game example here uh the default icon we're going to be making that in a second and then you can see I have three different tabs here you might only have two you might have five or six it depends on how many modules you install when you install Unity so uh before Unity basically came with a lot of different opportunities for exporting your game however the new way they're doing is doing it is they have mod ized uh how exporting works so when you install Unity you get to choose what platforms you will be able to build for and I've chosen that I want to be able to build for Standalone webg web player and uh then of course for um uh under this Standalone for both PC and Mac uh but if you haven't chosen this and uh haven't checked these boxes you can just re run the installer and install them uh this time so I really suggest you do that those are the basic platforms that you almost always want to have so um if you don't see your tabs here that is why you can just R run the installer so next up we have the resolution options I don't want the default to be full screen instead I want this to have some kind of um fairly small window it's a very casual game we've made here and so I don't want to clutter the entire screen with it it's it should only take up as much space as necessary and then therefore I'm going to set the default width to something like 650 and the default screen height to something like 550 so it will almost be a square it will be a bit wider and it won't take up too much space then next up U we have the ability to display a resolution dialogue when we uh Run the game that will allow the user to change input choose the right resolution and change the quality settings of the game that's not something I want the user to decide we've decided that beforehand so I'm just going going to uh be disabling that you can also of course turn this into a resizable window that's probably going to work fine with our game because of the way we have set up the UI but I'm again not going to allow the user to do that then we can uh override some settings for the stand alone uh when it comes to the icon we're not going to be doing that we are not going to be changing this Splash image either or any of the other settings then we can move on to the web player under resolution and presentation uh you can select a template here and a with hide I'm just going to leave all of this B and the same with the webdl just leave all of these settings so uh cool now we can go ahead and maybe create an icon so uh I'm going to again be using uh Photoshop that is my default um uh uh image editor of choice however you can pretty much use anything a very good free alternative is skimp uh and that's going to work just fine uh and this is not a Photoshop tutorial this is just showing you uh kind of how I sketch out my icons and I'm also going to be making this available to you if you want to use this that's fine uh it will be uh available to you even though uh also for commercial use and all that so um first off let's make a new uh file by pressing control n or command in and this is going to be the uh quiz game Icon and I'm going to make it 1080 x 1080 pixels so completely square and let's double click on the background here to choose a new name for it I'm going to choose a BG then we can uh go over here under our uh shapes tool and uh click and hold to select the rounded rectangle tool and uh then we want to set the radius to 100 pixels then I want to drag from one corner to the other and uh what we can do is then hit contrl T and then we can make sure that this is accurate by snapping the sides here um to the actual sides of the canvas this will just make sure that we don't have any overlapping or missing an edge or something like that then we can disable our background and we can choose another color for this and I want this to be a very uh light red very similar to the one that we have chosen inside of unity cool then I want to uh duplicate this layer by pressing contrl J and then press contrl T to scale this hold or drag from the corner hold down Alt and shift to scale uniformly and from the center and uh then we can just release that something like that and we can now make this a blue color instead some kind of light blue almost watery and now you can see we have a border and we have some kind of a background image and uh to give this a bit more depth I'm going to add a shadow from the border onto the background but I want don't want a shadow around the border so what we're going to be doing is right or double clicking on uh the blue image and then choosing an inner Shadow and then we can just uh scale this up a bit and you can see that that gives us some nice depth very easily we also going to be adding gradient to this and I want to change this to Overlay so we can still see the blue color and then uh simply uh bump down the opacity a bit so it's not too much that looks very nice and then we can take our border here double click on that as well and maybe add a bit of a gradient to this as well so again I'm going to be changing this to Overlay actually let's do a soft light and uh bump down the opacity quite a bit on this one I don't want it to be too apparent cool so now we have uh this cool uh icon feel then we can add some kind of um content to this some something that stands out in the middle and uh here I want to add some kind of question mark uh because it is a quiz game that we are making and therefore I think it makes sense sense to make a question mark so uh I'm going to press T to U bring up our text control here and uh I don't want to click inside of this because you can see that there is a circle around my cursor and that means that it will format the text to stay inside of these and that's not something I want so I'm just going to press out here where it's a square I'm simply going to make a question mark and you can see it before dragging in here I'm going to move this on top of all of the other layers so we can see it clearly and you can see the font I'm using here is Myriad Pro and I want the Bold type face you can use any form you uh or any um font you want and uh then we can press contrl T scale this up again alt shift uh something like that to Center this we can press control and then select the uh rounded rectangle over here so that will select that area and then we can uh choose our question mark and then we can go on layer align layers to selection and then choose vertical centers and then again layer align layers to selection horizontal Center so that will Center our question mark on this layer and that's perfect then we can double click this question mark and let's first give it a color overlay and select the red color over here that's going to be fine then let's give it a shadow so a drop shadow uh widen the size a bit and maybe give it a bit of distance to offset the shadow then we can go under bevel and emboss and we can maybe drag down the shadow mode opacity is zero and then just bump up the size so that will just make light fall upon the um question mark to make it stand out a bit and we can also add a quick Inner Glow to make it really pop so we'll uh make this fairly large let's make it red and then a very light red and then maybe bump down the opacity a bit so if I turn that on and off you can see really makes the icon stand out good so that's pretty much all I wanted to do for for this icon it's not the prettiest in the world you can definitely do more and you should definitely spend more time than me on this uh but uh I think it will do for now so let's press contrl s to save this let's save it under our quiz game assets Sprites and I'm just going to save it as a Photoshop file if you're using or something else you should uh save it as a PNG file because that is pretty much l lless so let's save that hit okay and uh let's uh head back into Unity go under Sprites and you can see it's now appeared here and let's just change this to true color and leave everything else as is then hit apply and that should work just fine good so what we can then do is go under edit project settings and then player and we will lock the inspector here go back under uh the Sprites and drag the quiz game Icon under the default icon and that will now be used for when we export the game so that is something we we are now ready to do so let's go ahead and actually do that let's go on file build settings and you can see that I have currently uh selected the webgl platform however I want to export to the PC so in order to change this I need to select the PC and we want this Unity icon to switch over to the PC we do that by hitting the switch platform Unity will reconfigure the project this might take a long time if you have a lot of assets but if we uh if you don't which we don't you can see it's almost instant so it's switch over now and this button is now grayed out that means that unity's editor is now configured to work as if it was uh playing on a PC good and uh then we can choose the target platform form we're going to select uh Windows you can of course select Mac OSX and again if you don't see the Mac OSX here on the Windows platform rerun the installer make sure to choose the module good and the architect Ure uh 86 means 32 bit and 8664 means 64 bit all computers run 32 bit some only some computers run 64 however in modern ages if your computer is uh less than 5 years old there's a really good chance that it runs 64 bit however for simpar game like this the architecture is not going to make much of a difference and every run can run 132 so if you don't want to worry about this just choose 86 and be done with it that's fine for our case and that's what we're going to be uh doing and then before we build we want to make sure that the scenes in build include our current scene so if it's not there drag it in or add the open scenes then let's hit build let's go under quiz game let's add a new folder called builds let's double click that let's add another folder and we'll call this window Windows double click on that and then we can make a file name and this is going to be the quiz game example and then I'm going to just indicate that this is 32bit let's save that and unity is going to build this it's going to do that fairly quickly because again we don't have many assets and it's going to open up the windows folders you can see here on the build windows we now have all of this uh different content and this has the XE file it has some debug files and it has a data folder with all of the um resources needed by the XE file to run the game you need to include all of this stuff when you share it with your friends so simply take this entire folder and you can compress it to a sip file and send it over if you want to deploy the game I recommend creating a setup file that you run that installs all of this this on the computer and maybe uh adds a shortcut to the desktop and to the start menu and an all uninstall feature again if you want to see all of that along with exporting to the web check out make a game video number 25 and 26 on the subject so uh without further Ado let's try and boot up our new game here and see it opens up this window and that is actually not the correct resolution that is not what I wanted I think this is too large but however we can just check this out so you can see if I true here it is indeed working so let's just go ahead and find our edit project settings player here and I don't believe that this is the default and I think the reason why it's not using the uh default is uh before I ran the game uh when I was testing out with a different uh default screen width and height and I think that it's saved that locally but if you run this on your computer it should be much smaller so uh just keep that in mind this are only the default screen and width uh and they can be a bit annoying in Windows so that's that's why Windows remember that I ran it in that resolution and so it did that again you can of course refresh that uh there are plenty of uh stuff written about this on the internet so that is exporting your game to uh windows that is kind of wrapping it up and all of the different player settings and stuff like that I really hope that you enjoyed this series I really want to do more kind of smaller series to show you different concepts of what it's like making different games I think spending a lot of time on one series is great and I definitely you want to keep doing that as well uh but it it kind of you kind of get stuck on maybe uh some very specific uh things and and and you don't have uh time to cover the very wide concept of game development so I think uh if you want to see more of these short series definitely let me know I really want to make more for you so uh that's basically it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in some of the other courses
