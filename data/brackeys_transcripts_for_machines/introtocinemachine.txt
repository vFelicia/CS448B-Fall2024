in this video we'll have a look at cinema Sheen and how I can use it to create awesome camera behavior in your game we'll also try to use it with timeline to create a cool cutscene sequence before we get started I just want to mention that I've recreated the brekkie site so it should not be much faster and prettier you can check it out at Brock acecomm alright let's get started so here's the simple scene using the Luo character from the atom demo and of course a main camera that currently points towards this character and we want to use cinema sheen to bring this to life well Senna machine isn't part of the editor by default so we need to go to the asset store search for cinema sheen click the first one here it's free and we need to download and import it the download should be really quick and you can just hit import and now you should see a cinema sheen folder in your project then we want to select our main camera and here we want to add a new component now we can go on the cinema scene and select the cinema sheen brain we don't need to adjust any settings here but now this component will link up all of our camera settings and they transform to the cinema Sheen system and now we're ready to get started so the first thing that we'll do is go to cinema Sheen and create a new virtual camera you can see that this now creates a new game object in our scene with a cinema sheen virtual camera component as with a normal camera we can now move this around as well as rotate it in order to position it correctly and you can see that whenever we have the camera selected we have these guides to help us position our camera for now we'll just ignore these so basically what we can do now is adjust this virtual camera to any position that we want and then cinema Sheen we'll put our main camera at the same position using the same settings this is cool because it allows us to create multiple virtual cameras and position them around our scene but right now our virtual camera is static so if we go ahead and hit play we can see that our character moves right through it we can change this by giving a virtual camera a target to follow we can simply take our Luo character and drag her into this slot now by default this might position your camera really weirdly it snapped ours all the way to the back here that's because we need to go under the body this is where we adjust the position of our camera and here we have a followup set that's currently set to negative ten on the Z let's go ahead and adjust this to be infront of the character let's also move it up on the Y and now we can play with these to get a nice position on our camera then when we play the game our camera will we follow our character you also see that our camera responds to all of our characters movements this is nice but I definitely want our camera to act smoother to change this let's go into the body and let's increase damping this means that it will take longer for the camera to adjust to new positions which will give us a more heavy and smooth camera feel I'm gonna set the X&Y damming up to something like sex and I'll keep the Z damming to one that's because I want our camera to follow our character pretty tightly on the Z when he's moving forward but I would like the changes on the y and X to be more smoothed out if we now hit play you can see that movement is a lot smoother on the X and y so it's really easy to get your camera to follow a moving target our character moves using animation but you can use the exact same method for tracking characters that are controlled by the player but right now we're only tracking the position of our character let's try and go to cinema Sheen and create another virtual camera now we can use our scene view to find a good angle on our character we can then make sure to select the camera and inside the scene view we'll press ctrl shift F you can do the same by going game object and selecting align with view I use this method all the time for finding good angles inside the scene view now this time we don't want the camera to follow the precision of our character we want it to stay in place but we wanted to always look at our character more specifically we wanted to look at the chest of our character so I'm gonna take loose body here and drag it into a look at target and you can see immediately that our camera snaps in place now if we hit play cinema Sheen will show our first camera you can always change between what camera you want cinema scene to display by changing the priority higher numbers means higher priority so if we wanted to show this second camera instead we would simply amp up our priority I'm just gonna set this to 15 so if you now hit play we can see that our camera always looks towards our character and we can of course adjust the way that this is done as well to do that we go under aim here we can have the ability to offset the camera we can also dampen its rotation and of course we have a bunch of framing controls we'll have a look at these in a second but let's first increase timing on x and y to say for now when we play we should see that camera movement is a lot smoother but the main strength of cinema sheen is to easily switch between cameras to do that we can use timeline to open this we'll go window and select the timeline editor let's drag this to the bottom to learn how to use timeline you can watch my separate video on this subject or you can just try and follow along here we now want to create an empty object fall of our timeline data let's rightclick go create empty and let's call this timeline let's reset the transform and now at the bottom here we can hit create this is going to create a playable for a timeline we can call this cutscene and this make sure to set up all the components that we need for our timeline as well as a basic track we can just go ahead and delete this track instead let's go in and add an animation track here we'll drag in our Luo character we also right click and hit add from animation clip here we want to select loose walk animation and now we can use our timeline to scrub through the walking I'm also just going to make this clip longer which means that it's just going to be repeating now we're ready to add a cinema scene track to do that we can simply drag in our main camera where our brain sets release and select cinema Sheen track this is where we'll place all of our individual camera shots let's rightclick hid adds in a machine shot clip and here we get to choose what virtual camera we'll use for the shot I'm just gonna drag in our first one you can see now that during this part of the clip will use the first virtual camera we then rightclick and add another cinema sheen shot and this time that's dragging our second virtual camera you can see now that once we get to this shot cinema scene cuts to the new virtual camera so this is already really really cool and we can easily use this to start creating our own cutscenes let's try and decrease the duration of our first shot let's have it switch over to our second shot let's also decrease the duration on that let's try and hit play to preview it so that's already looking pretty cool but I still don't think the framing is right on our second shot let's try and select it let's open up our aim section and now let's try and change the composition of this shot so the main thing to know about here is the dead zone that's the tiny square in the center what this means is that any movement from within this zone will not cause the camera to rotate so you can see if I move our character back and forth here a camera stays still it's only once he moves outside of this zone that the camera starts rotating you also notice that the tracking point actually gets pretty far away from the dead zone that's only because of our damping if we were to decrease damming to zero you'll see that our camera will always rotate to make sure that our tracking point is within the dead zone now I don't really want a dead zone for this camera I wanted to follow our character with a constant movement so I'm gonna take our dead zone width and height and decrease it to serum I do want a bit of damping though so I'm gonna up this to four by four now I can see that if we hit play a camera will try and follow our character's movement but it will currently try and place him in the center to change this we can change a screen x and y this will allow us to reposition a focus point on the screen so I'm gonna drag it backwards here and maybe a tiny bit down let's play it back and see how it looks now I like that a lot better but I still think we are missing a shot let's go to cinema Sheen and create a third virtual camera let's also drag our timeline here to the top so we can always know where it is and let's now select our third camera of course this is currently not being shown inside of the game view because it has a lower priority luckily we can always click Solo in order to preview a particular camera now we'd like to create kind of an oval shoulder shot and so I would like this to follow our camera as we've done before we're then going to take a little character and drag him in under the follow slot I'm just gonna aim the camera myself so I'm going to collapse this section and instead open up body here we can again adjust the follow offset I want to zoom in quite a bit definitely move the camera up and also move it over a bit because we currently don't have a look at we can of course rotate the camera in any way that we'd want and once you're happy with the framing let's go ahead and disable solar mode then let's select our timeline that's right click go adds in a machine shot clip and it's adding a third virtual camera let's move forward in time and again I want Z damming to be one extending to be four and y damming to before and let's see how that looks really cool let's decrease the length of this clip to fit with the animation and we should see that our cutscene now plays nicely but that's one more feature in cinema Sheen that could really help this pop I'm of course talking about camera blending right now when we transition from the second clip to the third we do that using a simple cut instead that select our second camera and that's simply drag to extend it onto a third camera what this will do is procedurally animate the position of our camera in a way that it looks over his shoulder much cooler than a so now if we try and play the game we can view our entire cutscene in sequence awesome that's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe so don't miss a future one I think's in a machine and timeline especially when bundled together is a really cool set of tools for designers and it's definitely a step in the right direction for unity I expect to see a lot more short films made with unity because of these toes if you make something cool definitely shared with me on Twitter at practice three on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to all of the awesome patreon supporters who donated
