thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to video number four in make a game a cool series on making a video game in unity so as always I've opened up the unity and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to expand on our levels so right now it's really boring we only have one cube for our sphere to stand on and jump upon so we are going to make multiple of those we're also going to add a skybox and we are also going to add textures to our objects so I'm going to talk about what materials are what textures are maybe even shaders and such so basically all the visual stuff is coming along now so beautiful let's get started so open up our level 1 scene here and let's first of all create a folder for our script so that what our project won't get all filled up so right click in our project pane hit create and then folder and let's name this script and drag our two scripts onto there cool now let's start out by importing a texture so basically what a texture is is an image that we wrap around our object so let me just open up Photoshop here and show you what it is I mean so we have our ball we have a ball object here woops they're trying to draw a ball it's not succeeding very well but that's ok so we have a sphere standing on our cube and on each object in unity we have a few different things attached you know we have a a controller object a rigidbody that pushes our sphere around so we have a rigidbody and we also have a controller script that allows us to move it and all of these are again odd components but there are also some components that allow us to change the look of things and one of these are called a material so we go down here and this is just shortened by mats so we have a material and on a material basically this stores information on how we want our object to look and it stores a few things so basically it stores first of all it stores a texture a texture and a texture is an image and it's what we are going to use to overlay our objects so we are going to wrap the image around the object just like when you take a bowl and a piece of paper and you fold it around the bowl that's what it takes to does and that allows us to add detail the material also contains properties like shaders and shaders are sometimes hard to understand for beginners but basically what they do is they tell our material how it should be affected by light so if we have a light emitting and it hits the material we can say whether or not it should be reflective like a mirror or whether or not it should go right through so that the material becomes transparent or if it should be diffuse and also it stores information about what kinds of textures you want to attach because there's there are other than image textures there are image textures image textures but there are also stuff like bump maps which we will get into to like make our game look even better or normal Maps as they are also called normal Maps so it's really the game object is what stores everything under there we have a material which does all the visual stuff under there we have a texture which is the image and a shader which defines how light hits it's that that's basically it's so now that we have the explanation out of the way let's go ahead and actually apply this so here we see the mesh renderer and you can see it has a material called default diffuse so if we go scroll down and this is the material this is the default diffuse that's the material we're going to make a new one because we don't want to use the default one so let's rightclick hit create and this is in our project pane hit create and then let's select material and let's call this ball wooden ball wood let's call it that and up here we now have a bunch of settings but before we go ahead and play around with this too much let's first apply to the ball but let me just change the main color to something darker so we can see being applied so basically what we can do is we can simply drag the material onto the ball and you can hold it over different objects and see it affecting them but just drag it onto the ball or if this is not working you can select the ball go into the mesh renderer materials and then drag it in there like that it's the same effect you'll get now we can see the material applied and once again we can select our ball and change settings here at the button or we can select the material and change settings there it will do exactly the same there won't be any difference I like selecting it in the project pane because then you won't get this grid and axis and Collider information and all that in the way cool so what we want to do is we want to make the color all white again you can also make it red and others but we're going to be applying a texture this one so we won't be needing the color too much you can see up here you have a property called shader and here you can you have a lot of options this won't make a lot of sense at the beginning the ones you're going to be using the most are called diffuse and specular shaders the difference is that it diffused reflects light just like wood does where a specular shader has this little glow effect this shininess which would be more common in stuff like metal in metal surfaces so now we're going to select the fuse and now we're going to add a texture but first we need to import it into unity so close down unity and here I found two nice shaders off of the CG textures comm a really nice website for finding free textures as long as you don't claim it's yours and then you can go ahead and use it also commercially which means you can make money off of games you make with these textures so it's a great website but if you don't want to find them and such you can just go to our website brackish comm and then this slider here should say make a game if not you can go into projects and then select mega game and here you can download the scripts and assets use that includes textures so it will be in the pack so that's awesome then go ahead and get it there and also it supports me a lot whenever you do that so it would be hugely recommended now let's finally humor the texture Wow the rough wood we are going to select that drag it into unity just drag it in there onto the project pane and release and now we have it imported it was that easy just to make sure we have the settings set right selected hit texture and then we are going to do yeah these these settings are just fine the many of these textures are completely ready for games already so you don't have to tweak anything also by the way unit is soon releasing a 2d version oh it's going to be in the same program but they are going to have to do features so if you are suddenly seeing that this is called sprites and that textures it's because you have set your project to be a 2d project so once you're creating it you should select that it should be a 3d project but you can change all of it after don't worry just hit Google and and there will be an explanation on how to do that so that's just for covering up Christians in the future now let's continue again so hit the ball ok hit apply to this and nevermind that error hit the ball and now let's drag on the texture oops what happened there oops I dragged it under the script folder that was not on purpose let's drag it onto the ball here waist it's none texture you can also hit here to select it yeah so let's select that and now we can see the texture applied to the ball beautifully so this looks really good what we can do now is we can play around with the tiling so if we want it to be a little wider or a little smaller in some axis we can use what is called tiling so let's select the material in the project pane and let's try to make our X 2 for example that is a little better that means that we'll make two copies along the xaxis we can also try three that's a little too much please play around with this value we can also make take our Y and maybe make it 0.5 and that might be good because we are looking at it from a distance we can go ahead and building the game view maybe not go ahead and please play around with these values we can try 0.2 and one that doesn't look too great either let's just go with the two and one there great so now that we have that set up let's go and hit our cube and let's now or our ground and let's now import the texture for that so let's head out here hit the medieval bricks drag it in just like the other one and release and make sure it's set to texture and this again looks just fine so what we can do now is we can make a texture for the ground so click create material or we can make a material I mean and then let's call this ground bricks and now we can drag on our middle evil bricks to that and then drag on the material onto the cube and you can see this looks all kinds of weird so what we're going to do is we're going to adjust the tiling and I'm going to guess that the xaxis need to be bumped up a lot so let's try five and it already looks much better let's try seven maybe and yeah that's not too bad what we can do is we can select our cube and we can see that our scale on the X is 10 and our scale on the Y is 1 so what we can then do is we can go back onto the material and hit and make sure the ratio is 10 to 1 and now it will look better but again these bricks are really small so instead we can make it 5 to 1/2 still keeping the same ratio this actually looks pretty cool in game also so please again play around with the values until you are satisfied and you don't have to use these textures you can find some of your on your own of course so it's completely up to you I'm just going to try playing around with this tiling option again just can't seem to get it quite right that is a little better I think and that was one and 0.5 so now that we have these textures set up we can go ahead and a expand a little bit on our level let's just also quickly add a skybox so we're just going to quickly go ahead and hit the right click in the project pane hit create and now I'm sorry not create but import package and then we should see sky boxes there and these are just some default sky boxes made by unity available if you don't have some you've made yourself so these are really great just voids all of that and it will just take a second for unity to import it and we should see a folder called standard assets and under this we have Skype access and here we go a whole lot of sky boxes now we can select our main camera this is where we put on our skybox and we want to add a new component and we want to add a skybox component so click Add component go in the rendering and hit skybox and what we can do now is we can drag in one of these make sure you're dragging the whole skybox and not one of the textures under the textures folder but the whole one so in the main camera we can also select this one and you can select different materials you can also select the one we've made ourselves so watch out for that that's not something you want to do I'm just going to try and drag in our sunny let's try with that one and you won't see it in the scene view but as soon as soon as we shift to the game view we can see the beautiful skybox applied and that actually doesn't look too bad I'm just going to try a few different ones I like the sunny that was a great guess and now when we play our game and looks very very much better so this is a lot more exciting we're also going to be expanding on lighting making that look more cool foreground background so objects a lot of stuff to play around with now that we have the scripting in place or leads at least the beginning of it and yeah so let's just quickly throw around some objects in our scene and then that much must be the ending of this video because we've been going on for quite a while great so what we're going to do now is we are going to make a prefab out of the ground what a prefab is is a genius thing unity of made it allows us to make our object into a shared object it basically means that we can change we can have a lot of ground objects all over our scene and then we can change one of them then hit apply and it will in fact all of the different objects so that allows us to quickly make changes to various objects scattered around our scene so now we can just go ahead and select our ground object and drag it down to the project pane and hit release and now it has automatically created what is called a prefab you can see that the ground object in the hierarchy has changed to blue and now we can just go ahead and duplicate this or drag in the prefab from the project panes to make another one and we can just drag it over and upwards or change the position variables over here and now we can start to shape our game by just simply duplicating here by hitting shift D or ctrl D that is and command D if you're on a Mac and then just rotating and scaling and adjusting these to however you want them and what now when we hit play we have a level mate which we can play and enjoy and this needs some adjustment so we can just go ahead and drag these two objects down a bit like that and remember whenever you are scaling and adjusting objects it's a good idea to keep track of whether or not you're using the local or global position up here in the left hand side this will this means that if we rotate our object it can either orient itself through the new rotation so we can drag it down this way or we can make it global so we can drag it straight down so that's a a great thing to switch between whenever you want to move these two down for example we probably want to do it using the global transform so we can move them uniformly okay so now let's play our game again and see if we can make this jump we made it and we can roll up this hill and please play around with it and we can also adjust the scale this is where the game design comes in and it becomes a lot of fun you can also duplicate the lights the possibilities are in the so that's pretty much the ending of this video I hope you enjoyed this enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one
