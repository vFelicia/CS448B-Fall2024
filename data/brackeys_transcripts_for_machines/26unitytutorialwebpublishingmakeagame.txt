thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone welcome to video number 26 in make a game a cool series on making a video game in unity so in today's video we're going to take a look at uploading to the web so this is the plan for today first up we are going to take a look at setting up uh the quality settings in unity there's also some player settings that we'll have to configure then we'll talk about uh using the Unity Web Player versus exporting for webdl uh and uh finally we'll uh configure the HTM uh HTML file meaning how your game is presented and then be uploading to either a site or our own site so I'll show you kind of uh your options on Distributing a webbased game cool so as always if you have any questions throughout this video head over to for. bra.com where I'm sure you'll get your questions answered awesome so the very first thing was quality settings so as always let let's open up unity and uh the player icon is not going to be important uh this time however we will have to go to edit project settings and then quality and you can see our different quality levels here I excluded them in the last video uh because I thought that the default settings uh were fine uh when it comes to uh Standalone player however I will give you the option to tweak this uh in uh a web player so you can see that we have the different build options here and we have the different quality levels uh that you can check for these and you can choose the default uh for each of them here and it will be highlighted in green so each level here has some different settings and you can see from uh for a web here it uses the medium quality you can also add a quality tier or a quality level and uh under the medium quality we see that we use a pixel light count of 30 that means that we can have 30 lights uh in the seene scene at the same time at maximum and that's fine for us the texture quality is going to be full rest which is great uh anistropic uh anisotropic textures um is a a per texture uh you can set this to forc uh on if you want to get rid of this blurring when viewing textures from certain angles you can see that it it uh kind of what that looks like in the scene here when I change our point of view and that might be something that you will want to prioritize uh with this game because we're going to be viewing this from the side at all times but again I'm just going to leave it at per texture here uh so I'll make so that I'm sure it will run fine uh when I'm recording too antialising I don't REM commend going above uh for a multi sampling on this one um it's U if you don't know what anti alling does aliasing uh is it kind of uh make sure that you get these smooth smooth edges so if I just disable this you can see that we get this these um blocky lines here uh kind of pixelated and and harsh and if I bump this up to eight you can see that it Smooths uh that out completely so two is decent and uh I think it'll suit us fine you can turn on soft particle uh particles here um but that's not going to be needed for our game and the rest will just ignore here and when it comes to Shadows I think our settings are going to be fine I mean we are aren really viewing these Shadows from from any crazy angles and it uh does give us a hard and soft Shadows uh which is fine cool so now that we've kind of set those up we can also look at what settings it chooses for our webgl export here and those are more moderate uh currently it's set to half the resolution uh no ntl ising uh you'll notice the pixel light count is is very low this time but again that doesn't make a huge difference for us only if we have like a bunch of coins which all have lighted on them uh you'll you'll notice that and uh you can also see that the Shadows are two hard Shadows only but this is really about playing around um and uh you can of course read a lot about how you can optimize your game so you can bump up these settings cool so uh let's go to the player settings so let's go under project settings and then player and uh these can also be accessed under uh file build settings and then player settings from here so right now you can see that I've uh go ahead and changed build to webgl uh so the default one is PC Mac and Linux Standalone and if you want to switch platform you simply select the platform you want to switch to uh in my case I've selected webgl here and then click switch platform and uh it's that easy you can see I could do the same with the web player I've just gone ahead and done this before I restarted the recording because it can be a slow process especially if you have a lot of assets in your scene cool so uh you can see here we have a bunch of okay uh just while remember this make sure all of your scenes are uh in the scenes and buil list or they will not be loaded and you'll have errors cool so these are the settings for the webg export and again I'll talk about the differences in a second and here you can see you can adjust the resolution of the player and that's something you can also edit at a later time uh you can adjust well not you want this to be able able to run in the background and uh I think uh we'll just leave that on and then you can choose an HTML template and we're just going to use the default one here icon and uh Splash image uh can pretty much be ignored if you do uh I think this requires the pro version still uh but you can disable the unity uh splash screen that means the unity ion showing at startup and then we have some other settings here which which I think we'll just leave for now on the publishing settings you also have some configurational options but I think all of this is a bit too advanced still the default settings will work just fine for us so just check that your company name and product name is as you want it to be and that the resolution makes sense for your game then you can go ahead and hit build and run over here we don't want to check development build and then you can choose a place to build it I've gone ahead and make a builds folder under the mega game project folder where I have my Mac builds my windows builds and my webdl builds here and you can see that I've built this already because webdl is still in preview and therefore might take a quite a while and sometimes you'll even need to restart the editor because something goes wrong in the process so be aware that uh this is not really a final solution okay so I think it's time that we talk about whip player versus webgl and we'll take a look at the web player player settings in a second so uh up till quite recently uh Unity has been using a plugin uh the Unity Web Player plugin uh that uh in order to support playing their games in a browser so you have this possibility to export to a web player and then you can uh upload it to any kind of a web server and uh all that the user needs to do in order to play it is visit the site and then uh download the plugin if it isn't installed already however uh this uh this Unity pluging uses a chrome API called the NP API uh whoops I wrote that wrong uh so I'll just write it here the NP API and uh the NP API is basically an API for programming uh plugins uh that Chrome has supported up until uh quite recently in 2013 they announced that this would be soon so would be deprecated and uh then entirely removed and that forced Unity to kind of redo and rethink how they wanted to do uh um Unity games on the web so what this means for us is that the web player currently works just fine on Firefox and Internet Explorer and other browsers but on Chrome it will not work you can go ahead and enable the NP API still even though it's deprecated but uh Google has said that they will entirely remove this feature uh in a uh near future so uh since most people are using Chrome uh the these days uh you it's worth considering doing something else and unity is doing so they are adding support for webdl based games if you don't know webgl is a graphics API or it's more than that now but it's another API for writing uh uh games or Graphics software um on the browser and uh there are a lot of uh good things about webgl for first off you D drastically uh reduce load times uh you don't have this loading bar it just jumps right in and uh also it's uh it's now of course supported on Chrome however webdl is still in preview and it's been so for quite a while now and uh it's fair to say that web deal is is pretty uh unstable at this point so let me just show you what this web build looks like in the browser you can see that this can be opened in Chrome I'll just go ahead and do so uh just a moment here so we'll open this in Chrome whoops it uh I get an error here just give me one second and I'll see what's wrong okay so I'm back and I just quickly read up on what was happening here uh well basically um I found this page in the documentation and i' completely forgotten about this because it's been a while since I've uploaded to uh webgl well uh if you go down here uh it will say that uh you can view your webgl player directly in the Firefox browser by simply opening the index.html file for safety reasons most other browsers Place restrictions on scripts open from a local file uh so this technique will not work when uh you go in and uh build your game using build and run and then open it um and set it to automatically opening Chrome however it will uh work because then it will temporarily set up an local server and uh it did so with me it set up this Local Host 54915 where I can access my game and this is going to be different for you uh but if it does so that's great and you can open your game here if not then I suggest you test it in Firefox well you can see our game is currently working here and I can roll back and forth and can uh change the music and I'll go ahead and play the game here and you can see that we can also uh maximize the game and uh the game is indeed working uh not as pretty as the web J uh player but it is indeed working so just go ahead and die here and you can see that that works just fine so again if it didn't set up that Local Host uh then I suggest just running it uh in Firefox when testing it locally like this um but know that it is supported in the Chrome browser you'll just have to host it in order for people to uh play it so I'll just open with Firefox here to show you that this indeed uh does work so you can see that I've opened it in Firefox here and we'll just wait for it to load and you can see that loading is much faster than it would be on a uh Web Player um using the plugin cool so that's it for webgl what do we do if we want to export to the much more stable web player I think this is the best option so far I know you're using losing a percentage of the market uh but a lot of people play uh Unity games uh on Firefox and Internet Explorer and that works just fine so if we want to build for web player all we have to do is change switch platform to the web player and it's just going to hold on for a second there and all of these settings we can leave as is then we'll go over here again we can change the uh screen width and Screen height and we can change the template again icon can be ignored the same with Splash image and all of these other settings can also be ignored now we'll go ahead and hit build and run uh actually I'll just hit build and uh then we can make a new folder and we'll call this um web player and we'll just hit select folder and it will start building so we'll just wake a wait a second here and if we open this up inside of our Explorer and open up the web player folder here we can just check out the folder structure that it will generate in a second or the file structure I should say so you can see here inside of web player it's created only two file files so you can see that exporting to webg creates this fairly complicated hierarchy of folders and files uh you have the compressed game you have an HTML file that you use to load the game in and uh all of this other data whereas on uh in the web player folder you only have two files you have the HTML file which shows your game and you have a Unity 3D file which is the game itself so you can also see the the uh size difference between these two so if we want to now run our game we'll just have to right click and open with Firefox and uh you can see that it now uh displays right there and it actually loaded really really quickly uh but I've also been loading this game before so that might be the reason why load times will uh often be much slower so you can see we can play our game here and it looks a whole lot better than the web player or the webgl version uh so far so the game is working cool but what we can do is we can edit this HTML file whoops we can edit the HTML five uh file to change uh the way that we present our game so in order to do this and this is very easy especially if you know HTML U we just need to right click on this HTML file and hit edit with notepad and this might look a bit frightening uh but uh with me here and you can do the same thing with uh the uh webgl export so we have an uh HTML structure then we have some JavaScript code we also have some CSS and uh then finally we have some more HTML so the first part here is all of the HML that shows uh above the actual player the JavaScript is responsible for loading the player in the CSS is responsible for styling all of the the elements in our HTML and uh the last HTML part here is responsible for what is shown after the actual plugin and this also contains uh an error if the web player is not um supported in the browser isn't installed so we can actually just go ahead and change a bunch of things here so we for example change this from Unity Web Player Mega game to uh something else if you want to do that we can go down here and change the font size and weight and all of that uh or maybe um since this is a bre tutorial um we could add onto this so here it says that it was created with unity we could say and using uh the make a game tutorial series from uh from and then Braes and we'll change the title here to go to bra.com and we'll change the url here to bra keys.com so we can save this out and we can close this we can run this with Firefox and you can see that it loads in the game and down here it says created with unity and using the make a game tutorial series from brais and you can click that there and it will go to bre.com so you can change that file however you want uh it to be cool so now that you have your game you've chosen the option that you want to export it uh that you want to use when exporting you have chosen uh how you want it to display now you have to choose how you want it to be uploaded well before we have this uh possibility of uploading uh unity game using Dropbox but that has gotten pretty clunky lately and uh it's not even really an option for uh free uh Dropbox accounts that are free so instead we are going to have uh to look at two possibilities the first one is uploading to a site and if this is something you want to do well then you can just completely ignore your HTML file then you'll go ahead and upload this Unity 3D file and uh places to upload to could be congregate uh or uh you could also upload to something like um what's it called uh it's called new grounds or armor games uh there are a bunch of uh places that you can plays your game uh if you don't want to host it yourself so for example here you see uh the congregate website where you can go and uh you can see that I've uploaded a game here called kill quite a long time ago and uh you can go in here and simply up hit upload your game fill in some information and a category and then upload the unity 3D file and all that so that is definitely an option or if you want to host this yourself well uh then you can just uh if you're using Wordpress or whatever uh use some kind of uh FTP client so FTP stands for file transferring protocol I'm using the program called filea but this will require some hosting so you will have to uh kind of pay for a domain of course own bra.com so if I just quickly go ahead and connect to my website here there we go uh you can see all of the files that are on the bra.com domain uh on my hosting provider and uh I'm using Wordpress um but most or pretty much all um uh web file structures has a public HTML folder where you can place different files that you want to people to be able to access without requiring a password or getting through any kind of protection and uh in here we can then create a directory and we can maybe name this U make a game and uh we can double click that and uh then we can simply drag our two files into this so we'll maybe rename this to make a game uh web build and uh we'll rename this to the same drag those two in there and uh actually let's just make sure that we we probably need to yeah we need to edit the uh name of the unity file in here too so whenever you change the file there you need to change it there too because it initializes the plugin by loading uh this file uh so I think that's all we need to do uh hopefully let's just make sure that this is working by running it in Firefox yep that was all we needed to do uh and so we need to do the same thing here we can simply remove those two and drag in the new versions there we go and now you should be able to go to your domain so I'll type in bra.com SL make a game slash uh make a game web build. HTML and you can see that it says Chrome cannot run this app and uh if we do the same thing in Firefox if we open this up it should simply load the game game so you can now share this URL with all your friends and they will be able to uh load that up oops leave that cool so that's basically how you can uh export your game for the web you have some different options there and uh how you can upload it to a site of your choosing I know that Unity games on the web is kind of on a weird middle ground right now uh where it's it's in the process of transitioning from the web player to webdl but uh try and look at this at it as a lot of possibilities instead of a lot of restrictions uh which is uh sometimes can feel like so uh I hope you enjoyed this video and and found it informational and uh uh a lot of these uh things uh depending on what you choose is something that will require you to search up uh on how to upload to congregate or a guide on FTP uploading to a server and all of that because it's simply too much for me to cover in one video but you should get hopefully get an understanding on how this work from uh this video so that pretty much concludes the make a game course I don't have much more to show you when it comes to uh this game and uh I hope you've enjoyed the process and and learning some stuff with me and uh well from this point I suggest you check out some of the other courses that are available on the brei YouTube channel uh there are a lot of stuff on uh C programming uh both inside and outside of unity which I suggest you check out uh a cool uh thing to start doing now with maybe uh uh learning from the uh how to program in C course and then maybe uh using that together with the how to uh make a 2d platformer course uh in order to get a deep understanding of how to program in C and how to uh apply more advanced programming Concepts uh to game development in unity so that's really something I suggest you check out now and uh there will be some links on the screen here uh so click on those and again thanks for watching make sure you subscribe to stay tuned for the next series that I will be introducing which I hope will be super cool and uh yeah thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
