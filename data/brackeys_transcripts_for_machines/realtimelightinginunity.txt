in a previous video we created this scene using the progressive light mapper now big lighting is great because it's very performant and allows for very detailed lighting but if you want your objects and lights to move around you of course need your lining to update to these changes luckily unity has a bunch of tools for creating realtime lighting so today we'll have a look at these tools and how to use them you can always jump to the timestamps on the screen now if there's any particular feature you're interested in this video is sponsored by the unity asset store and IBM IBM Watson unity SDK enables you to integrate powerful artificial intelligence in your unity applications with Watson Unity SDK now in the asset store you can configure games and projects to understand speech talk with users and understand the intent of a user in natural language the services include speech to text text to speech dialogue translation a natural language classification and are accessible directly within the Unity environment so get started simply download and try out the IBM Watson unity SDK for free on the asset store also check out the short series from IBM which provides an overview of all the core features of the Watson Unity SDK and with that let's get into the video so I've set up this example scene here and as you can see the lighting is currently very boring the colors are washed out there's only a single light in here and it's just using completely standard settings by the way if you want to get your hands on the same environment that I'm using you can simply download it off of dev assets all the assets are pay what you want and of course have a link to them in the description now before we start messing around with lights in our scene we want to make sure to set up all the appropriate settings the first one is configuring our color space to do this we go edit project settings and player and here we change the color space from gamma to linear as you can see right away this darkens our scene but it also adds way more color depth we also want to go to our camera and make sure we have allow HDR enabled for the rendering path we have two options for word and deferred I've talked about the rendering path HDR and the color space in another video on getting good graphics in unity so if you want to know what all this stuff means I definitely suggest checking out that video but for now just note that I expect to have a lot of realtime lights in my scene and whenever that's the case you're probably best off going deferred finally we can edit our quality settings by going edit project settings and selecting quality and the main thing that we want to do here is up the pixel light count this is basically a way to limit the amount of light calculations that we need to do so in order to display all the lights in our scene we definitely want to amp this up to say 20 if you want you can also finetune the shadow quality but I'm just going to leave this at high resolution so now we've set up all the right settings but one more thing that I like to do before actually lining my scene is adding postprocessing to my camera and that's because in order to utilize all the data captured by our camera whenever HDR is enabled we need to use a postprocessing effect called the tone mapper again if you want to learn more about this stuff check out my video on good graphics in unity for now we can just go and open the asset store he will search for postprocessing we'll want to select the postprocessing stack and import it when you're done you should see a folder in your project called postprocessing then we need to add a component to our main camera and the component is called postprocessing behavior this will apply the effects to our camera and this takes in a postprocessing profile this is basically just an object that stores all of our effect settings let's go to the project right click go create postprocessing profile we'll call this CC for color correction we'll select our camera and drag in our CC object and now when we select it we can see all the different effects that we can now apply to our camera and the main one that I always make sure to check before adding lighting to my scene is color grading the reason why is that under the color grading you can see we have options for tone mapping and now here comes a matter of preference some people like to use the neutral tone mapper and then do all the color correction afterwards but I've recently been really fond of the filmic tone mapper as you can see really darkens our scene and adds a lot of contrast but in my opinion it also gives it this really cool filmic look just to make it a tiny bit brighter I'm also going to go to the post exposure and add 0.4 so now that we've set up our most basic color grading we're ready to start lighting our scene I'm gonna go window lighting and then settings and this is going to open up the lighting window as you can see we have a bunch of diff settings in here but we're actually going to ignore most of them we're only going to focus on the first two modules on the realtime lighting you just want to make sure to check realtime global illumination and under the environment we have a few settings that we can play around with the first one is the skybox material here we can of course change the skybox that surrounds our environment and the cool thing about unities realtime lighting solution is that unity will now automatically apply lining to our scene depending on the skybox that we have applied this is what we refer to as environment lighting as you can see the source is currently set to skybox and I have an intensity multiply here and you can see as I increase this just how much it makes our environment blend in with the skybox so whenever you're lighting an outdoor scene I really recommend spending a lot of time finding the right skybox you can always go to the asset store and search for skybox and there are actually a lot of really great ones here and many of these are actually free one that I really like is to free HDR sky now as you can see if I add this to my project switch to the scene view here and go and change the skybox material I'm just going to change to the skybox day this immediately impacts the lighting of our environment and if I switch to sunset you can clearly see how the intensity and color of the light changes but for now I'm just gonna switch back to the default skybox I'm gonna set the intensity multiplier to 1 and we can actually go in here and change from skybox to gradient this allows us to create our own custom lighting gradient from the sky color to the color around the equator and the ground or if you just want to apply a flat color you can do that as well whenever I'm lighting an indoor scene I always make sure to set the color to a complete blank but this scene is not indoors so I'm gonna change it back to Sky box and set the intensity to around so now it's finally time to start adding actual light emitters into our scene I'm gonna get rid of my directional light here and show you how this is done try the light tourist scene with simply right click in the hierarchy go light and here we can select from three different realtime lights directional light point light and spotlight the directional light applies light from a given direction you can see if we add this to a scene it applies to all the objects within it it actually doesn't matter where it's placed the only thing that matters is how we rotate it as you can see right away there are no shadows we need to enable these manually so we'll go into the shadow type and here we can select either hard or soft shadows hard shadows of course always completely hide where soft shadows are kind of more realistically blurred out of it now we can position our direction of light where we want it to be I'd like it to kind of come from the left hand side here we can also change the color of a light I'm gonna make mine a tiny bit warmer by tinting it Orange as well as the intensity of the light one technique that I often like to apply when using directional light is what we refer to as two point lighting this is where we have a main light I'm gonna rename this to main light that is the main source of lighting in our scene this illuminates our subject from the front then a bit to one of these sides on top of the main light we also apply what is called a rim light I'm gonna rename this one to rim light and now this light comes from the back kind of pointing in the opposite direction of the main light now for this light we probably want to decrease the intensity a bit and what we often do is tint the rim light a blue tone again this helps it contrast with the main light currently this effect is very subtle but it's also supposed to be we can't go ahead and bump up the intensity a tiny bit though so now that we have our main directional lights in here it's time to make our scene feel more alive by adding point lights again we wanna right click in the hierarchy code light and select point light and just like directional lights emit light in a certain direction point lights emit light from a certain point so if we reset the transform on this and drag it into a visible part of our environment we can immediately see that it starts applying light to this part of the environment the intensity might be a bit too low here so we'll bump up the intensity to say 2 and we can also adjust the range of our light you can either do that by dragging on the sphere or changing it in the inspector I'm gonna set mine to around 20 so as you can see this immediately gives a very cool effect especially if we go in here and at shadows however if you have a lot of point lights in your scene having all of them rendered shadows can be quite performance intensive so I definitely recommend that you keep this at a minimum but for now I'm just gonna set this to hard shadows and as you can see this immediately looks super cool now I'm gonna go through the scene here and add a bunch of point lights with varying color I find that for fantasy environments like this one it's really important to play around with different vibrant colors so I'll see you in a bit so as you can see that helped quite a bit the scene feels way more interesting and less flat now I also think that we might have exaggerated the amount of light that we need from the directional lights so I'm gonna go into my main light here and decrease the intensity a bit I'd rather have the point light take over and make it feel like most of the light is coming from the environment itself now I don't think it's needed for this environment but we do have a third type of realtime light I'm of course talking about the spotlight the spotlight is fairly selfexplanatory it allows you to create spotlights within the scene I found that I actually very rarely use this light but it can be really nice for highlighting certain parts of a scene or of course for creating stuff like flashlights say we wanted to really emphasize these two skeletons a way to do that would be put a spotlight right on top of them maybe move it a bit closer you can play with the range of the light here as well the spot angle and then increase the intensity and we can of course also add some shadows and as you can see it really helps our skeleton pop but for now I'm just going to delete it now the last type of light that I want to add is actually not a realtime light however I'll show you a few tricks for making it look like it is what I'm referring to is what we call emissive materials so I would really like this doorway to light up this way it could kind of act like a focal point for the scene but how do we do this using lights all the lights that we've seen so far to emit light onto the surroundings but they aren't actually visible themselves how do we create an actually visible light but to do that we first need to create the object for our light if you want to make a lamp you can go inside of blender or any other 3d modeling program and model out the lamp in our case we just want a flat doorway so I'm just gonna use a plane we'll rightclick in the higher Kiko 3d object and select plane and it's gonna create a flat plane inside of the game I'm gonna rotate this by 90 degrees so it's pointing directly forward I'm also going to slice it down I place it in our doorframe once we're satisfied with the placement of our plane we want to go ahead and add an emissive material to it to view this we'll right click in the project go create material and we'll call this material glow we'll select the plane and drag our glow material onto it and now we can pretty much leave all the settings as is here the only thing that we want to do is go ahead and check emission here we can define a color for our mission I want to make this a light blue and I've actually prepared a color beforehand you can go ahead and copy it if you want to I also want to bump up the intensity of the emission which we control over here so I'm gonna set that to 5 and as you can see our object now looks very bright but it doesn't have that glow light effect and it's still not influencing the rest of our environment well for the first problem we can fix that using a postprocessing effect so remember earlier when we added some color grading well we can actually go in here and add some glow as well we refer to this setting as bloom and as you can see right away when I check it there's really no doubt that it's working we can go in here and we can adjust the threshold this is how bright something needs to be in order for us to apply a glow to it I'm just gonna set this to something like 2 then we can also adjust the intensity as well as the radius of the glow now I don't want this to take over the entire scene but I definitely want it to be there so that was pretty easy but it's still not really applying light to the rest of our environment and the reason why is that unity won't actually apply light from emissive materials in real time you need to bake your scene in order for this to happen but we can fake it to do this I'm simply going to use a few point lights so let's take one of the point lights from our scene and duplicate it let's move it close to the doorway and let's simply tend it in the light blue color you can see right away it looks like the light is actually coming from the door it's that easy no one is ever going to notice that we're actually using a point light to do this and you don't even necessarily need to put it right on top of the door of course this might give really nice shadows but I like it more out here why it's actually lighting up a larger part of the scene so once we're satisfied with all the lights I'm gonna right click in the Harkey hit create empty object and I'm gonna rename this to lights and then I'm gonna select all my lights and drag them in there and I've actually placed my environment on a turntable so if I go ahead and hit play the entire environment is going to rotate now of course we want our lights to rotate with it so I'm just gonna take my lights here and parent them to the turntable and now we can see our entire scene rotating and updating in real time and the final thing that I always add to my scenes which are lighted in real time is a third postprocessing effect now this one is a nice one let's select our CC layer and let's go to the top and check ambient occlusion and right away this might not do much but we can play around with the radius and the intensity in order to really help at detail to our lighting ambient occlusion is basically just the shattering that happens when two surfaces meet you can see this if I enable and disable it that every time we have a sharp angle between some surfaces ambient occlusion gets applied of course play around with this effect to make it suit your scene but I definitely recommend adding it that's pretty much all of my realtime lighting tips for unity from here recommend you to play around with different lighting setups different lighting settings postprocessing effects and of course trying to tweak these settings to make everything as performant as possible and of course make sure to have fun that's pretty much it for this video make
