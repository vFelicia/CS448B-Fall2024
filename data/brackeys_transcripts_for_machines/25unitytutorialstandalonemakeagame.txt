thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to video number 25 and make a game a closed series I'm making a video game in unity so in today's video we're going to take a look at exporting our game to a standalone application that means that we will build our game for both Windows and Mac and in this video we'll take the windows files and turn them into an installer an actual setup file and we'll have an uninstall file and all of that cool stuff and also we are are able to build the app the Mac application on a Windows computer here so I'll show you how to do that also and the process is the same on a Mac and I'll talk a bit about what you'll typically do with the application on a Mac once you've build it and yeah that's basically all for the intro I will mention however that I will also be doing a tutorial on exporting for the web so if you want to have a webbased game I'll show you how to do that too but that's for a future video and as always if you have any questions go to firmed up branches comm you can find many answers there cool so as always let's open up a unity and you can see I've updated to unity 5.2 and lots of cool stuff in this update most notably we now have the unity services integrated into the unity editor as you can see by the cloud symbol up here but that's not something we're going to be using today since it's also pro only for a lot of the stuff but first a thing we want to do here is simply select the icon that we created in the last tutorial and we want to change the settings around here bit because if you remember in the last tutorial when we build our game just to ted test it out the icon look really blurry and sometimes you can force windows to update the icon and make it look sharp again by simply moving it into another folder or restarting and something like that and but I found that the settings that work best for creating a sharp icon on Windows and and will work most of the time if we if we actually change this back to editor Korean legacy GUI and change the filter mode to try a linear you will also make want to make sure that the format is set to true color that's it I plan that that this is something that's constantly changing and it's kind of annoying that you can always be sure that your icon will look great but I find that these settings actually work the best cool so now we want to go to a file and then build settings or ctrl shift B and the first thing we want to make sure is that all of the scenes we want to have in our game are added to the scenes inbuilt list and if you're using uh if you're loading scenes dependent on an index you will also make want to make sure that these scenes are in correct order so here you can see we go from the main menu to level 1 to level 2 and then to an end level scene cool so down here you can see a list of all of the different platforms that unity supports today we of course going to be looking at the PC Mac and Linux standalone and you will want to check if there is a unity icon to the right of the name here and you can see on mine that is yours might be on one of the other platforms and if that is the case you want to select the PC Mac and Linux stand alone and hit switch platform this will force the unity editor to use settings that works with the on platform selected and it might take a little while to do then also you can see the target platform here we have three choices today we are going to be ignoring Linux and I'm sorry Linux users I like in Linux too but not today and let's start out by exporting for the Mac here so simply select the Mac OS X under the architecture you can the 32bit which is x86 or you can choose 64bit which is this one or the universal one most of the time you are going to be just fine using the 32bit version you can of course have multiple architecture versions for your program this is completely up to you if you don't have a clue about of what I'm saying simply use the 32bit one most modern machines today support the 64bit but if you want to make sure that all of your friends can play in this on all that computers simply select a t6 or 32bit and we want to uncheck development build here because this is going to be our final build and then we want to go into the player settings and just make sure that all of this is correct so the company name should be Brad keys in my instance the product name is just going to be mega game and then we have the default icon you of course want to drag this in there if it isn't already and down here you can see we have a bunch of different tabs for the different platforms and this is the standalone tab so we want to check or change these settings depending on what we want to do well first off default this full screen is fine for me I think this game is fine in full screen default is native resolution that's definitely something you want to check most of the time and I'll allow this to run in background other than that capture single screen that can be be ignored I want to display the resolution dialog because we haven't actually made a resolution setting option inside of the game so the resolution dialog is is the small window that pops up before you start your game that allows you to change resolution quality settings and controls so I'll just enable that use player log is if that's checked unity will actually store debug log statement in a log file so you can view them afterwards this is not something most of you are going to be using but you can leave it there resizable window I'm not going to check that and Mac App Store validation now let's talk about how you distribute software on Mac well if you want to release your game on Mac and you're going to of course build this and you'll get get an app file and an app file is basically just it looks like a single file but if you rightclick it you can actually view all of its contents and and it actually consists of a bunch of sub folders and sub files but the app file in itself is not something that you want to be distributing instead you can either you upload this to a website of yours or Dropbox or some kind of file sharing site and in order to do that you will need to wrap it in a disk image file and this standard here is what I call what is called a dot dmg file and if that's something you want to do and that's something most programs are uses on Mac and then I'll have a link in the description that you can follow that will show you how to package it in a dmg file and that simply means that you download a file from wherever you've stored it you open it and it will prompt you to either run the application directly from the disk image or simply drag it into the Applications folder it's something you've probably done a bunch of time without thinking about it but that's an option or you can of course publish it on the Mac App Store and if that's something you want to do and that's something a lot of people will want to do because then you can easily give a price for your game and you also don't need need a website or any dedicated place for people to download it you can simply use the premade app store well then you want to check this option right here and basically what this does is it will make sure that if your game is not downloaded from the App Store well then it's not going to be able to be run so that's something you'll want to check if you have plans about publishing to the App Store then you have the full screen mode this should be a pretty selfexplanatory a full screen window with menu by and dark will be fine I think and these two can be ignored visible in background don't want that and I think it's fine that you can run multiple instances of this and I think our game currently supports should support all aspect ratios so these are resolution screen arrest ratios and I think that all of them should be fine here you can of course limit that if you want to then we dig into the icon and you can override some of these if you want to but they should be fine just using a single one this splash image here you can use a custom dialog banner and that means that when we run the game the resolution dialog will pop up and that has the possibility for you to put in an a custom image there that has something to do with your game and this is where you would want to drag that in I don't we're not going to be doing that in this tutorial and I will just continue then undo other settings this is a bit more advanced and can just be completely ignored so basically that was everything we need to set up and think about before building so now we can go and do build and you can see that under our mega game project I've made a folder called builds and inside of this I think we should make a subfolder called Mac and then here we can simply actually will make another subfolder called x86 so 32bit and we can simply call this make a game and then x86 cool and you can see it saves it as a dot app and what this means is that if you're viewing this on a Mac you will see this answer file as an application that you can run but when we are viewing this on Windows we simply see it as a folder with a bunch of subfolders and this was what I was talking about so there are a bunch of stuff inside of all of these cool so now that we have that done the process is exactly the same for 62 bit or 64 bit and you should be able to simply export for other Mac versions there again either to upload it to the App Store or check out the guy guide in the description on making wrapping this in a disk image so you can easily upload it to any file sharing side of your choice next up is Windows cool so let's go ahead and change the target platform here to Windows and again you can either select 32 bit which is 86 or 64 bit which is this one down here and for now I'm simply going to export to 32bit because then our program is going to be supported by all computers you can of course have to download links on your site one for 32 and one for 64 then we want to go and hit and again we can go into the player settings here and just check that everything is as we want it to be and this is just something you should double check here and then we can go ahead and hit build and we can go on the builds create a new folder called windows create a new subfolder called 86 and then name this make a game x86 and it's going to go ahead and build this and once it's built it's going to open up here you can see that our icon is now looking much sharper than it did before even though we are making this huge you can see it's very very sharp cool so what we can do now is we can go ahead and make this into an installer you can of course create a 64 bit version but we'll just go ahead and make an installer out of this so now we can actually close down unity I'll simply minimize unity here and what we can do is we can use a program called Ino setup so I NN o setup and if you don't have this already we can go on the web here and search for you know setup here and this is a very good program actually and it's also free for creating installers of a bunch of files and it's fairly simple to use and it offers a lot of customization you can actually make your own scripts and edit these in order to configure exactly how you want your installer to look and what text you want and how you want it to compress your files you can do so much stuff with this but we assume we're going to take the fat assembly fairly simple right route and simply download the you know setup here and then go and do stable release and download the X file XE file here so simply hit random side then you'll get the executable and simply run that and install it once it's downloaded then we can go down here and run a no setup compiler and it's going to prompt you to either open an existing script file or we can create an empty script file or create a new script file using the script wizard so basically in a setup uses these scripts that will compile your program into a setup file and they've made this useful wizard if we don't want to make everything by hand so now we can simply hit next and we can give our application and name and this is going to be make again and this is version 1.0 from brad keys and you can also input a website here and i'm simply going to do wwww stackon then hit next and last i'm they want these to be installed in the Program Files folder under the application for the name we are going to select make a game and we are going to allow user other users to change the application folder if they want to then let's hit next and now we want to basically find the files on a system that we want the installer to install so let's hit browse here and let's find on our system the executable that we just built so under is on the Dropbox and then make a game builds Windows 86 and there it is so simply select that and now this is maybe a bit funky but you are going to have to create another folder to store this data folder in because what we are going to write now we've only associated the EXCI file we also want to associate the data folder but when we add that in here it actually doesn't include the folder itself it just extracts all of these files at the same level as to make a game file and therefore we need to create a folder to wrap this in so we'll simply copy the name here and then create a folder and we'll simply call this data and then we'll drag the mega game 86 data into this data folder and rename this to exactly the same so now when we open this we see another folder with the same name and inside of that is all of that data so you can see what the hierarchy looks up like up here so what we then do is in here we say that we want the user to start the application after setup has finished if you want to and then we hit add folder down here we navigate to the place where we have stored this so again this is for me under Dropbox then make a game and builds Windows 86 and then we want to select the parent folder here it's very important that you don't select the subfolder but the parent folder because then when this is extracted this folder is what is going to be lying alongside our executable so simply select that and hit yes to this because we want to include all subfolders and now we hit next and yeah fine we'll make a Start menu folder called make a game and we'll allow the user to change this folder name to disable the the creation of that create an uninstall icon in that folder and we also want to allow the user to create a desktop icon you can change these settings like you want to then we have the possibility to attach a license file or some information files shown before and after installation so if you want to make some custom text saying thank you for downloading and you can check out our github page here and this was made using practice tutorials and then a link feel free to do that but just know that the license files are in the files that you attach here need to be in either dot txt or dot RTF format and they are of course a completely optional so I'm just going to hit next then you can select what languages you want this installer to include and I'm simply going to use English here but you can use select all and just allow that to automatically translate itself then hit next here and now we want to choose the folder where we want our setup file to be compiled to so let's go under browse here and I'm going to go under find our Dropbox folder here the make game folder should be here there and go and do it builds windows and actually instead of yeah builds windows and then make a new folder here and call this installer okay and let's rename this to make a game setup and then we'll do 86 and we can maybe grab that in parenthesis cool and then you can change choose a custom setup icon file I think we're just going to use the default one and set a password if that's something you want to do I'm just going to hit next and finish and you can see that in our setup compiler now creates this coollooking scripts with all of our settings you can see that our whoops sorry about that you can see that our app name is mega game our app version 1.0 it has references to all the files that we're going to be needing and and that's super cool it's basically done all of this for us and the cool thing about the way that it sets it up here is if we've made us sing a small mistake along the way we can simply go into the script and by hand we don't need to go through the entire process again so now we would like to compile the script so simply hit yes to this and I don't think we want to save the script anywhere you can do that actually let's just save this so in under your windows and then installer we can simply save this as make a game installer compilation or compiler installer compile installer script we could do something like that so then you have it and you can always open it and make a small change and then compile or create this setup file again so let's hit save on that and it's going to start compiling and if we go under builds Windows installer you can see that we now have the script here which you can open up and change that's this script here and we also have the exe we have the executable setup file and this is what you would then upload to a web server or to mediafire and share with your friends because if we run this now simply double click that and give it permission you can see we get this coollooking Installer welcome to the make it game setup wizard then this will install make a game version 1.0 on your computer you can see that it creates all of this text for us we have the title here we can go next you can choose a custom place to install your game go Next again here and that's the Start menu folder and we can not create that or create that and then hit next and we want to also create a desktop icon next again and install and it's going to quickly install a lot of stuff and now we can launch the mega game immediately here I'm just going to uncheck that to show you that it's now on the desktop here as a shortcut it's also in the Start menu here on the recently added and if we go and open the file location you can see that our mega game XE executable is here our data is here that's also an uninstalled EXCI so if you want to uninstall this program you can simply run this and now we can simply double click make a game to open it up and you can see we have our display dialog er resolution dialog with the banner that you've input that you've set if you have said any banner I don't think it's necessary this is just a formality kind of but you can of course put something coollooking there and now we can hit play and enjoy our game as installed by I in our system so we can now hit play game here and play through ok so it's actually that easy so that's basically all I wanted to cover in this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'm definitely looking forward to showing how you can export your game to a webbased platform as well so again thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
