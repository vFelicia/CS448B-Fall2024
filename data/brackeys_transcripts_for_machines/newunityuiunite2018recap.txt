you night 2018 kicked off last week and man am i excited about some of the new features in this video we'll take a look at the biggest and most awesome changes that will be happening in unity in the near future with that said let's jump right into it and let's start small at least that's what unity did when they showed their improvements when it comes to deploying on really lightweight platforms such as messaging apps this might not sound like a big achievement but applying on a platform like this requires an extremely light build size and with the help of VCS it looks like unity has managed to compress the runtime to only 72 kilobytes which is just crazy small so I guess at least when it comes to gaming platforms moving on The Book of the Dead demo project is out and available for download and person is super excited to start playing around with it during the keynote unity also announced a new project they're working on called Mars the mixed and augmented reality studio Mars is a unity extension that as the name suggests allows you to create AR applications in unity an example of this could be using reallife objects as part of your game level they also did a live demo showing off the tools but as it sometimes happens with live demos it didn't really go according to plan on second try however they did get it working but I do think that issues like these speak to the fact that the general state of AR is still very early with that said I must admit that I was quite impressed with the facial tracking even with the live demo running in real time on stage the tracking seemed to hold up very well next up unity also gave some new information on nested prefabs apparently nested prefab is only part of a whole new prefab workflow this includes prefab mode prefab variants and of course nested prefabs you can definitely expect to see some content on this soon now what if you could create your game without worrying about setting up complicated animation rules creating transitions manually or creating nested state machines in answering this question unity is bringing machine learning into the world of animation with kinematic ax a new experimental package coming to unity later this year this system is able to figure out which animations to play based on player input and the player's position in the environment kinematic ekam binds fragments of the different animations you feed it to create seamless and dynamic motion in realtime they showed it off using some mocap data and I was actually really impressed with how smoothly it ran this is something that I definitely was not expecting but it's really interesting and now something unity has never done before changed their editor design the changes aren't huge but it definitely has a more modern flat UI also most of the icons of being changed it won't interfere with your workflow but it's definitely noticeable especially if you've been playing around in unity first long as I have and is it just me or did the free editor skin get even brighter finally you need to teach the new node based video effects editor a bit more still not much concrete information about the feature I'm just waiting impatiently to get my hands on it they did however mention that GPU particles will be part of it so that is definitely cool also following tradition unite contained a road map talk of the features that are coming to unity in this somewhat near future let me see how many of my favorites I can mention in under 40 seconds all right here we go new unified settings window and unified user Preferences window template games for networking starting with the FPS archetype shader graph support for HDR P starting in 2018 point two and in point three we will have note grouping as well roundtripping workflow with FBX export makes integration with maya maya LT and 3ds max much more convenient core terrain updates in 2018 point three include custom brushes better performance more script ability and more for 2d we get the brandnew 2d sprite shape tool in 2018 point two and point three will bring multi sprite support to character animation finally hexagonal tile is going to be a thing in 2018 point two and in 2018 point three so is isometric tiles and to be honest this is just a snippet of all the cool stuff that were mentioned in the road map so to sum up lots of awesome improvements coming soon I'm a bit disappointed that many of these features aren't live as a preview just yet but again I guess we'll just have to be patient well of course try to cover each of these features as they are released on that thanks watching and I will see you in the next video thanks out the awesome patreon supporters who donated in June and especially thanks to Michael Neely Clinton
