something that can be extremely useful when learning how to use unity is some solid examples especially for artists or non programmers in general it can be really difficult to start with a completely empty scene I mean not that it ever happens to me but I'm aware of the issue but most of the time you want some basic mechanics in place like a character and a camera rig as well some visual tools to help you start crafting levels and this is exactly where the Unity game kit comes in the game kit comes in both a 2d and 3d version and is basically a collection of mechanics systems tools and assets to hook up gameplay without writing any code in this video we'll be focusing on the 3d game kid but the 2d version is also available and works in much the same way that's of course I'll link to that in the description also this video is sponsored by unity so let's get started so first we have to install 3d game kit to do this we go under window and we see like the asset store the shortcut for this is control 9 let's go to the top and type in game kit and we see both the 3d and 2d game kit appears I'm gonna select 3d and now using this button to the right we can both download and import it do note that the package is quite big it's for gigabyte in size this is because it's packed with a bunch of high quality assets so importing will it take some time now I'm gonna hit import and because we are importing a complete project it's going to go ahead and overwrite all of our current project settings I'm importing this into an empty project so that's fine by me and I'm just gonna hit import we then get this window where we can choose what parts of the package that we want I just want to include everything so I'm simply gonna hit import when it's done we should have a folder called 3d game kit and if we open this up we can see a bunch of different sub folders with the different resources that are in the pack if you go under scenes then game play we can see that there are two example levels that we can check out let's start by opening up level 1 here and as you can see level 1 is a huge outdoor scenes showing off a bunch of the different environmental assets we also have a player setup called Ellen they also some enemies in the scene as well as some different into activists and moving objects like doors and different puzzle elements so I would definitely recommend trying to play through this level and seeing how these different systems can be used together the game kit uses automated hardware detection to automatically adjust quality settings so the game should run just fine on your computer however I found that when running it inside of the editor I sometimes can get some framedrops so if you want you can always go to edit project settings then quality and tune down your settings here if you want better frame rates for now I'm just gonna leave it add fantastic and let's try playing the game so as you can see right away we can move around and control the camera the game also comes with a tiny example tutorial so here we can jump over as well as a weapon so I'm gonna go here and select this staff and we can use the staff throughout the game to destroy these crates or fight these enemies and here's an example of one of the puzzle pieces this is a trigger pad and if we step onto it we can see that a doorway opens and this cutscene is triggered I definitely recommend playing through the rest of the level and trying to tweak different things in here to see what happens there's also a second level and this is more of an indoors underground environment so again really just have fun with these scenes now once you're ready we can try creating our own level from scratch to do that we go under kit tools and we create a new scene here we can give the scene a name I'm just gonna call it example level and let's hit create and right away you can see that it creates this new scene with a bunch of different things in it and we also get this pro builder popup window I'm just gonna dock this to the side of my scene view and let's have a look at what's in here so the first thing that is in here is of course our example character Elin and she also has a camera rig attached to her if we go to the game view we can see there's also a skybox in here with some distant mountains of course our character is standing on a ground plane there's also some UI showing our current health some tools which we will get into later there's some light postprocessing and another cool thing that's in here is pro builder now if you haven't used pro builder before we have a dedicated tutorial on the subject so definitely check that out basically what it allows us to do is easily create and edit meshes inside of unity so if we for example select our ground plane here we can simply go to the top and say choose the very text addiction mode and we can then start editing the geometry of a grant playing from within the editor so that's pretty cool for now we'll just use the default assets as is so I'm gonna go ahead and close this window and now let's try and throw together a quick environment the first thing that I'm gonna do is select our ground here I'm gonna choose R for scale and scale it up a bit and you'll notice that as I scale this up our texture simply tiles nicely across it we don't see any weird stretching I'm also just gonna flatten the ground a bit by scaling it down on the Y so now we have a fairly large piece of ground then we can go under the 3d game kit folder under prefabs and then here are a bunch of different ready to use prefabs that we can simply add to our game I'm gonna go under environment then rock and you can always click on assets to preview them I'm gonna take this cliff big here and drag it into the scene and you can see it already looks really nice in our scene we can then rotate move and scale it to place it where we want I'm just gonna drag in some more cliffs so I think that already looks a lot better we can also go under stonework or structures and in here are a bunch of really cool manmade monuments for example I'm really fond of this floor circular so I'm definitely gonna put that in here alright so that's most of the base structures of a level done I'm also gonna go in and add her dropship so under environment there's a folder called dropship and there's also a prefab with the same name I'm just gonna flip this to a point towards her just to give our level a tiny bit of context and at this point we can go in and add some vegetation some ground coverage and just some overall detail to help tie the level together and of course there are prefabs for this as well but going in and placing individual rocks one by one will take a huge amount of time for a level like this luckily this is where the tools come in here we have a vegetation painter if we open this up it split up into four different categories let's start with the ground cover and when we click this we can see there's this instance painter component here in choose between our different prefabs so there's currently some grass and if we just hover over our ground we can see that we now have this brush we can control all the different settings for our brush to the right here but it's pretty good to know that if we simply hold down alt and scroll we can increase or decrease the size of it so I'm just gonna paint in some quick grass around our level we can also add a bit of the other plant here which I really like once we've covered the ground with some detail we can go in and paint some of the larger pieces of vegetation and here we have a bunch of really coollooking alien plans to choose from again I'm just gonna scatter some of these around the level and finally we can add some rocks to our scene of course this works in exactly the same way that's a final touch I'm gonna go in new structures and add in a alien statue this one is just circle now let's try playing the game to see how it feels I am by no means a level designers I'm actually quite pleased with this but of course we are currently just running around in an empty environment we need to add things that we can interact with to do this we go under prefabs and interactable x' and the first thing that we could add to our scene is a destructible box let's simply take this and drag it in and now when we run up to this box and hit it it's going to get destroyed so that's really easy of course there's also some more interesting objects in here such as a moving platform let's take this and place it over here to the side of our character and this moving platform uses a component called this simple translator all this component does is allow us to move an object from one point to another and you can also see that we have two points in here we have an end point and a start point so I want this platform to move up and down I'm gonna take the start point and just set that to zero zero zero and then I'm going to take the end point and set that to zero zero zero as well and then move it up a tiny bit on the Y we can also use these handles in the scene to control it if we then make sure to select activate our platform we'll start moving right away and currently the loop type is set to once which means that it will move from start to end and then stop let's instead set it to ping pong which will make it bounce between the two repeatedly and if we play that we can see that the platform is indeed moving between those two points and we can of course jump on and off it as we wish another interactable you can use is a door there are some different variations in here but we've actually already added one of these in form of this huge gate however the version that we added was only for environment set dressing it doesn't have any functionality so I'm just gonna remove this and instead I'm gonna drag in the door a huge gate wave from under the interactive post folder and right away we can see that on this is a simple translator as well and this is simply going to open up the gate for us of course it would be pretty boring if we simply open the door right when we play the game instead we want some way to trigger this functionality and this is where stuff like switches or pressure pads in it for example we take this pressure pad and add it to our scene I'm just going to zoom in to focus on it and find a good place for this we can then use this pressure pad to control our doorway and we do this using a command commands in the game kid are used to control different objects using some kind of a trigger so on this pressure pad that's already a script called send ontriggerenter and this is going to go ahead and send a trigger command to an object of our choosing in our case we want our doorway to open so it's simply going to take our huge doorway and drag it into the interactive object slot and you can see that it recognizes that there is a game command receiver on this object in fact if we select our doorway we can see that it's right here we also see that on the symbol translator script the interaction type is set to open this means that if we go to our pressure pad and set the interaction type here to the same thing the command is going to be properly triggered there are some different ones in here like activate spawn or destroy and that should work right away in fact in a scene view we can already see that there is a connection from our pressure pad to our door and if we play this and move on to a trigger we can see that indeed our door opens awesome so that's kind of how you can combine together different interactable to create behavior for your levels finally we of course also need a way to add enemies to our game luckily this is super simple if we go under the characters folder there is a folder here called enemies and in here we have three default enemies there's two Chomper the spitter and the Grenadier which is kind of set up like a boss I'm just gonna take the Chomper here and I'm gonna add him to the scene I'm also gonna hit F to focus on him right away we can see this huge graphic appear this is his field of vision and is where he will search for the player if the player enters this he will start attacking and we can of course go in here and configured if we go into the player scanner we can change the detection radius as well as the detection angle we know sir configure other settings like the amount of hit points this enemy has currently it's set to 1 and our staff deals 1 per hit let's try setting that to 3 to make him a bit tougher and right now our enemies should work but he won't actually be able to move the reason why is that all enemies in the 3d game kid use the navmesh system and we haven't created a navmesh surface for our level yet in other words we need to tell our enemies where they're able to move around our level doing this is actually really easy we just have to create a new empty game object I'm gonna name it navmesh surface I'm gonna rightclick and reset the transform then we'll hit add component and search for navmesh surface as the agent type will select Chomper and I know this is called Chomper but you can actually use it for all the enemies then under include layers we need to choose what layers we want our enemies to avoid let's just set this to nothing and then go in and add both the environment as well as vegetation and now we can simply hit bake and we can see that it automatically generates this nicelooking blue surface of course all the blue parts are places that our enemies can move and finally if we go back and play our game we can see that if we enter into the field of view of our enemy he will start chasing us around and start trying to attack us and if we attack him back we can kill him with three strikes super cool so that's pretty much it for this video from here it's up to you to start using these tools to craft your own levels remember you can always use the example levels as reference to see how different prefabs can be used together and that thanks watching and I will see you in the next video yeah thanks to all the awesome patreon
