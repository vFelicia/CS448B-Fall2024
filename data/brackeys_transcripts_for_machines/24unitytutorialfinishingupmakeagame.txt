thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to video number 24 in make a game a cool series on making a video game in unity so this video is called uh finishing up and it's not going to be the very last video in the series because I want to do a couple of videos at least on uh building your game and exporting to different platforms but I also wanted to do this video that just uh took care of some loose ends and just uh polished the result a little bit so the stuff that we are going to be doing today is first off we are going to just adjust the controls because I think that they are uh a bit uh annoying at the moment then we're going to create an enemy death sound and that's going to be pretty much a power up sound of some sorts then we just going to quickly do some organization and finally we're going to add an icon to our game and uh the software that I'm going to be using for this is Photoshop because that's what I'm most familiar with uh but pretty much you can use any kind of 2D editing software like which is free or you could even go ahead and download a UPA toolkit um from the unity asset store it's an asset by uh me uh which allows you to create pixel art really easily inside of unity so if you wanted to make a cool pixel out logo you could uh use that cool so um but the things I'm going to explaining be explaining are pretty General and I will also provide you with the finished icon if you don't want to make one yourself awesome uh so as always if you have any question throughout the video go to fm. bra.com and now that we've set all that let's just get started with today's video don't mind me using the uh Pro skin uh everything is still going to apply to you okay so first uh thing on the list here is uh controlls so uh if I just go ahead and play the game right now and just turn off my monitors here so the music Don't doesn't feed into my microphone uh you can see that our we have a working menu with a music slide and all that if we hit play game we can play through the game and I've just made some very few adjustments I've simply uh pulled apart the platforms a bit so the uh character doesn't get stuck between them and also uh you can see here if we just complete this level I've uh made a second one and that's simply using all of the same uh assets uh just one enemy we have some coins placed in different places and uh all I've done with this platform here simply rotated uh it a bit around the uh zaxis that must be and whoops it looks like I didn't complete it there but if uh and you can see I've plac placed a um if we go into level two here a checkpoint right there and uh if you get down there it simply takes you to the end level uh scene which of course displays our score cool so that's uh basically all there is to uh the game right now and you can of course expand on this but I think that's going to be the finished dat uh that uh I'm going to export my build in uh or my gameing so let's uh start out by just adjusting these controls so if we go under the ball and go under the ball control script I first off want to kind of make the controls more Snappy and a pretty easy way to do this is bump up the angular drag angular drag is basically the resistance on your rotational movement so if we bump this up all the way to 10 and then increase our rotation speed to uh be 10 folds which is 2,000 uh and then bump up the mass to two we're going to get a lot L of resistance and a lot of uh we're going to need a lot of power in order to rotate the rigid body but once we have that power um it's uh going to feel a lot more uh Snappy we're going to uh accelerate quicker uh more quickly and uh we're going to be able to uh change direction more quickly so you can see here what that does and it actually makes it a lot more fun to play because now you actually have a chance uh in controlling whether or not you hit an enemy cool uh so that was the first thing uh next up is the enemy death sound so if you haven't already you can download the uh make aame assets from bra.com and uh I'm just quickly going to show you how to do that so of course breast.com simply go there go under projects select make a game and simply download the scripts and assets right there cool and once those are downloaded it's simply a zip file so you should be able to open it without an extractor or if you have issues you can use WinRAR then we go under audio and I've made this uh or I've found this power up file um from freesound.org and I've made sure that the license is creative common zero so you can use it in any way you wish also for commercial uh projects so if I just uh play this quickly uh wait a second let me just turn on my monitors here there we go so it's kind of this uh rewarding sound uh that the player should hear when he uh kills an enemy so let's load that into our game so simply drag it and uh hover over unity and simply uh drop it under the audio folder and it should rest in here uh so we can find the Power Up Sound there uh and what we basically want to do here is um find our enemy object the enemy Center here and uh well this gets deleted the second uh that we uh killed the enemy if I I'm correct here so let's check that out look in the hierarchy over here actually it doesn't so that's perfect or remember we did the death animation and all that so uh all we need to do is basically just attach a audio source here and drag in the oops what's the no reference let's double click uh that to open it up in uh in what should be my not develop I see that I've still configured this with the visual studio so I'm just going to change this in uh the edit project nope preferences external tools I quickly just switch that to mon no cool so let's try and open that in mono develop and see what this error is all about cool so it's trying to restart our level but apparently it cannot find the game master is what it looks like so we'll simply say that if game uh if game master is not equal to null then we want to restart our level and this is a very handy thing that a lot of people don't know if you hold done alt and press up and down you can move lines like that so that's uh super useful so let's try that again uh I'm just going to jump on him there we go so now we don't have any issues okay so um basically what we want to do is reenable this audio source and uh we can drag in the power up clip and uh the audio is just going to be the uh is is not going to be anything in particular uh we don't need any control over this and uh the volume we're going to have to see about that so uh basically Let's uh uncheck play on awake and let's find a way to trigger this sound so let's double click on the enemy and add some code onto this so let's uh start by making a uh reference so uh death particles we're also going to make a VAR death sound of type audio Source um yeah that's perfect and uh then under the uh die method uh we want to instantiate death particles and we want to say death sound. playay and this takes in a parameter if you want but that's a delay in samples so that's not something we're going to be needing uh cool and now we can simply drag this audio sour in there and everything should be working you uh want to make sure to set the spatial blend to 2D uh if you want it to uh play as normal uh but if you want that 3D sound sense of direction uh then you can of course use the slider I want this to be entirely 2D so let's try that that's perfect I didn't want this huge sound just a small one to indicate that we've done something great okay so uh let's now just hit apply on that and all those settings should save and we can also hit apply uh on our ball if we didn't do that before which I don't think we did so we are speeding through these points today the next up is organization because I want this uh project to look a bit more needy uh so let's take our current score destructible down hit endpoint enemy final score and kill on hit scripts and drag them under the scripts folder let's also make a scenes folder so let's create a folder called scenes and drag in our levels and our main menu and next up we have these two materials so let's drag them under the materials folder great so now everything is just as it should be one thing I like to do is I like to have the opening scene which would be our main menu in the root assets folder this way people know what to click if they uh download the project and want to start from the very beginning next up we go under uh file build settings and make sure that all of your scenes are in the build settings that's very important cool so the final thing that we need to do is just creating an icon so uh let's do this um we could use several assets from the game in creating this icon uh for example we could use uh this guy uh but since this guy is modeled after a Mario character that might be a bit too much uh so we could use the ball here but I really like the look of our coin right now so let's actually snap take a snapshot of that so um let's just temporarily disable everything but that uh coin that is in the frame so let's disable uh the ball let's disable the platform to there we go uh now we can go in here and we can turn off the Sky Box using this button here we want the lighting to be on because I like the uh lighting effect that comes from uh the sun being high heightened a bit and uh then we can turn off all of these gizmos that are also in the way we could uh do 3D uh icons and just size them all the way down which I think is what we're going to do we can also turn off the grid and now we actually have a clean background uh to use so let's just zoom in on this might as well get get a pretty HD uh picture you can also full screen this by using shift space which I'm going to do and you will notice that it is U uh clear that this is a fairly low poly object uh but I think that will be fine for our case so now let's go under our Snipping Tool uh some kind of uh or uh Windows uses the Snipping tool for screenshots on Mac this would be command Shift 4 uh in order to take a screenshot where you can uh select part of the screen as um as the uh image you want to take whoops whoa I did something crazy there so let's Zoom back in on the coin and we need to find a good angle I think we want it kind of from the side here so something like that looks fairly decent and uh whoops Jesus Christ what why does it keep doing that so let's try and zoom in on the coin here let's do this one last time I think I I hit some kind of mouse button there okay so let's take the Snipping Tool again command Shift 4 in the Mac let's hit new and let's just drag around this fine now let's uh save this as coin you can just save it on the desktop so far and uh let's open up Photoshop and just clean up my desktop here a bit cool so uh basically all we're going to do is we're going to create uh a new image and I like to make this uh much larer larger than it needs to be let's do 1920 by 1920 or uh actually 1080 by 1080 it's going to be fine and we're going to call this the make a game logo or icon and uh let's just hit okay it's going to create this image now let's double click on the background rename this to BG and uh let's drag in our coin cool let's scale up this coin and uh let's now remove this ugly looking background so uh we can just use the magic War to do this let's just see how that looks uh first click to make a selection this then press uh control shift I to invert that selection and then uh click on the mask down here the layer mask and it will mask away all that so that actually looks fairly good and uh we could do some more stuff with this I think that we should maybe uh do some kind of uh background for this so uh let's go ahead and create a rounded rectangle Tool uh let's select a color for this and maybe some kind of Deep Blue could be fun here uh let's round the corners a bit more than uh 10 pixels let's try 40 pixels and let's try and drag this by pressing in the center then holding shift and ALT something like uh this then let's Center this both this and the coin uh by uh pressing control and then clicking on the BG here that will select our entire screen we could also just uh use the rectangular Mark tool here and just uh Mark everything off and uh then we want to select this rounded rectangle go under uh layer align layers to selection vertical centers and layer align uh layers to selection horizontal centers and uh we'll do the same thing with our coin so let's just drag this under our coin image or layer align layers to selection vertical layer align layers to selection horizontal just to make sure that it's in the center now we can uh scale this up to fit our entire screen cool and uh let's see what do we want to do with this uh you can see here that the mask hasn't been perfect so let's just make sure to delete simply select the mask over here then hit M select all of this and just delete that just to make sure that we don't have any ugly edges is once we export this uh maybe it would have been a good idea to like increase the radius on this to something uh more um but I think for now we're just going to stick with uh the 40 here I'm doing this fairly quickly just to demonstrate how uh you would go about doing this so we can play around with uh some different uh colors here I kind of like this light blue which is also kind of a a um uh theme color for the Mega game series so let's just stick with that uh and we can maybe do some kind of cool looking Edge on this so let's duplicate the rounded rectangle and just drag it in a bit and uh let's make this uh darker and still give it a bit of blue I'll show you something cool you can do with this just in a moment and then we can double click this and select inner Shadow and bump up the size on this and that really adds some depth to the picture and now we can just change the uh color of our edge here because I want it to be kind of more bright that is pretty fine I want the edge to be larger because the icon is going to be fairly small and we can also give the coin here a drop shadow so drop shadow on that size it up a bit that looks fairly nice we could also make it Glow if we wanted to but I think we are just going to uh not uh we could also add a bevel to the outside here but I think that's going to be a uh bit too much uh however it would be pretty nice to add some kind of uh gradient to that so let's go under gradient overlay and let's change this to luminosity and let's actually let's change this to Overlay instead and let's bump down the opacity quite a bit on that so something like this looks like a pretty cool icon it's very simple and easy to just take an uh element from your game which you think is pretty Central and then just kind of make a background for it and whoops you have an icon so I think we're just going to stick with this it's not perfect um but I think it will be pretty good for now so let's uh go under file save as let's locate our project folder uh actually I'm just going to save this into our um our asset pack so uh let's go under Mac assets here uh let's go under um textures I guess I really want this to be named images Maybe actually let's just save this in the root folder so make a game Icon and this is going to be the PSD version save and also we'll make a JPEG version uh for those of you who have not uh who don't have uh Photoshop installed and uh now we can simply open up Unity we can go and uh simply drag these into the RO root folder of unity uh so I'm simply going to uh you know discard my changes to the scene go on the main menu and hit don't save because we don't want to save those changes and we can go back in and enable all of the gizmos here and show the grid again and whoops we are back and uh let's just go under the Mac assets let's go and drag in I'm just going to drag in the pstd in a unity and you can see it Imports the icon nicely we then going to change this from texture to uh Sprite and uh you can basically leave all of these we want the filter mode to be bilinear you could do trilinear and we want it to be true color and a maximum of 248 just perfect hit apply on that and uh now we can go and uh simply insert this into our build uh settings so if you go on the build settings select the platform you want go under player settings uh you can see that we can change this to this company name is braies the product name is make a game and uh you can simply drag in the default icon and you can see it scale here so once you build this and um I'm just going to do a quick test build hope that this U works out or I'm going to go into depth uh way more depth with the build settings uh in some of the next videos but now let's just build this into uh the desk into um find the Dropbox here um mag make a game and let's create a separate folder here called builds and let's call this test build it's going to save that and it's going to start building okay so it's done building and uh you can see that window sometimes has this weird bug where it shows the icon at really low resolution uh but I find that sometimes if you just move it from one folder to another it refreshes and other times you have to restart and uh that's I don't know it's some weirdness uh but we're going to look into making it into an installable and all that in another video but just for now if we hold down control and zoom in on this we can see that it's actually pretty high resolution and that it looks really nicely and if we open that it's of course going to start up the game cool so that was basically all for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to finally building our game uh uh properly in the next video so thanks for watching and I hope you enjoyed it
