in this video we'll make a mini map using rendered textures let's get right into it so as you can see I have this very simple scene with a player that we can move around but of course it's very much in need of a minimap but in order to create a minimap we need a second camera that can render our scene from a topdown view to do that let's deselect everything rightclick in our hierarchy and select camera let's then reset the transform on our camera and make sure that this sits at the same position as our player to do that we can select our player right click on his transform hit copy component we then select our camera right click and hit paste component values but we want to move our camera up so let's drag up on a y2 something like 20 let's also flip the camera so it's facing downwards we do this by rotating by 90 degrees on the X and first off we want to make sure that we have all the same settings as our previous camera because in most cases you probably want to render the seam in pretty much the same way to do that let's select our previous camera hit right click copy component it's like our new camera and paste those back in in my case this just changed the background to a solid color then we can change the projection from perspective to orthographic this pretty much just removes all perspective from our scene this is something that almost all minimaps do it's great because it gives the impression that the scene is laid out flat we then use these sides to zoom out on our minimap and you can choose the size of your zoom here you can have it show the entire level at once or have it only show a small part of your level but then follow around the player I'm just gonna set mine to 15 we can also delete our audio listener our GUI layer and off layer layer we only want to be using the camera but currently our minimap is overlaid on top of the entire screen and that's not really the effect we're going for we want our minimap to be shown as part of our UI let's now rename this object call it minimap camera let's go into the scene view and let's create another object this time we are going to go under UI and we're going to select raw image we then switch into 2d mode and hit F to focus on a raw image now a raw image is basically like any other UI image component except it takes in a texture instead of a sprite this is good because basically going to tell our minimap camera to take everything it renders and put it into a texture this is called a render texture we can then take that texture and display it on a raw image let's select our 2d controls up here let's zoom out a bit and now we can position our mini map where we want it I'm gonna anchor mine to the top right here I'm gonna set the offset on the X to negative 75 and the same thing on the Y I'm gonna set the width and height to something like 170 by 170 and then gonna offset it on the X&Y by about 110 so now in our game view we should see a white square in the top right corner of where our minimap is going to be but of course we still need to display our texture to do that we create a new render texture let's go to the project right click go create and now select render texture and let's call this our minimap render texture here we have a bunch of texture settings we're gonna leave pretty much all of them as is our link to where you can read about these in the description first off we can set the size to the same as our raw image let's set it to 170 by 170 and we can also disable our depth buffer if we now select our minimap camera we can see here that there is a target texture variable and this takes in a render texture let's simply drag our minimap Brenda texture into this slot and you can see now that our game view switches back to our main camera so a minimap camera is no longer rendering on screen instead all of its data is being fed into this mini map render texture and if we click on it we can actually see the preview here so now all we need to do is select our raw image and drag in our mini map render texture as the texture input and voila our camera is now rendering directly onto the screen as a hue il iment now we can rename this to our minimap and if we now hit play and start moving around the scene you can see our player moving around of course our minimap isn't following our player yet but we can add this very easily also remember that you can style this minimap in any way you'd like it works just like any other UI element you can add a mask in case you want say a circular minimap you can easily add a border I'm just gonna right click go UI and add another image I'm gonna scale this up to be about 178 by 178 then gonna place this behind the minimap I'm gonna call this the minimap border we then parent the minimap to the minimap border make sure to anchor the minimap border to the upper right and let's have our minimap snap to the center of our minimap border so now we've created a border for our minimap let's now have it follow our player of course the easiest way is to go ahead and just parent this to the player and as you can see this works just fine as long as it plays only rotating on the yaxis but this is not always the case so better more stable way is by creating a small script let's call this our minimap script let's say create an ad and open it up in Visual Studio now first off we want a reference to our player will create a public transform player and then instead of the two default methods we'll create a void and now this is going to be a late update method we want to do this in late update because it's called after update and fixed update and so we'll only update the position of our minimap after a player has moved in here we can create a new vector3 this is going to be the new position of our minimap and we can set this equal to our players position of course we still want to be zoomed out on the Y so we can set new position dot Y to our current Y position we can then say transformed up position equals new position if we save this go into unity make sure to reference our player and hit play we can now see the minimap actually follows around the player it doesn't rotate with the player but that's a very common thing for many mini maps if you wanted to also rotate with the player we simply go into our code add a few lines and we can now set transform dart rotation equal to quaternion Euler and here we feed it 90 degrees on the X a player's rotation on the Y and here we want to make sure to use Euler angles dot Y and then zero on the Z let say this going to unity hit play and voila our camera is now also rotating with the player less of course a lot of fun stuff that you can do with your minimap from here and out you can add icons you can add the ability to zoom in and out by simply adjusting the projection size of your camera and you can add lots of styling options and mass let's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe
