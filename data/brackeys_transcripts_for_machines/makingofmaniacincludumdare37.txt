hello everyone and welcome to this behindthescenes video showing the creation of my entry into the lottery 37 combo so those of you who don't know lottery is a game development competition where you get 48 hours to create a game from scratch using only selfmade assets some people choose to work in teams they participate in the jam where you get the next two 24 hours however I worked on this game alone so I submitted it to the combo I started working as soon as I woke up the theme had been announced while I was sleeping and so I was excited to find out what I would spend the next two days on the theme was one room I began by sketching out some ideas on the whiteboard my first idea Hey all right my girlfriend's idea was to make a game with the player would fold through a huge pipe and the goal was to avoid obstacles along the way however I thought that the core gameplay was too similar to previous projects of mine also got the idea of creating a programmer simulator where guy would build the programming career sitting on the computer in his bedroom kind of like game dev tycoon this idea had a lot of potential for throwing in some fun jokes and references but I thought it would be too complex to get some actual gameplay going finally I came up with the idea of doing a traditional defender Castle game the main character Bob the maniac is an introvert who is tired of people bothering him all the time so he decides to wipe out the human race all without ever leaving the comfort of this room with this idea in mind it was time to boot up unity I quickly got some enemies walking across the screen I also did a first pass of the shooting mechanic it's not pretty but it worked next up with spawning enemies at first I use the same technique as in my wave spawner tutorial but I found it this way I would have to spend way too much time creating and balancing each individual wave instead I opted to create a pool of enemy types each with a wave start that determines the number of waves before the enemy type starts spawning and with a weight that allow me to make some enemies spawn more frequently than others of course I had to come up with a few algorithms to adjust the amount of enemies and the spawn rate so that the difficulty of each wave would decrease as the player progressed but not doing all this by hand saved a huge amount of time and also made it much easier to adjust difficulty by simply changing some numbers in the algorithm now that the core mechanics were in place it was time to begin working on graphics so I quickly threw together something in Photoshop as the main enemy I created a stick figure and exported every limb as a separate stripe this allowed me to quickly create simple animations inside of unity without having to deal with large sprite sheets Oh and game development is exhausting so remember to eat once in a while at this point it was all about creating more content for the game I programmed the weapon manager that allowed me to swap different weapons in and out at first I made a pistol and Uzi a rifle and a sniper but later I added a bazooka and even a nuke using the same system I made some particle effects to make each hit more impactful and even added in some camera shake for the enemies and made a Humvee the tank and a huge stickman who's a pain to deal with and that was pretty much it for day one for day two I began by redoing the environment a long shower made me realize that some cuter graphics would make the whole thing more enjoyable I also added a custom cursor that would flash red unsuccessful hits it's always a good idea to give the player visual feedback on how he's doing to give the player a sense of progression I added an item shop where you can buy weapons health upgrades and even unlock charts and missile launchers that will automatically kill off incoming enemies as a currency I chose to use insanity because I thought it helped tie the gameplay together with the story and talking about story I needed a good way to display the backstory I'd created for this I made a separate scene that would load before in the main level so avoid just displaying a big chunk of text I made the letters animate in one after the other I think the final result worked pretty well of course make sure to always add a way to skip stuff like this but only a few hours left before the deadline I realized it wouldn't be wise to spend time on a menu so jump right into the audio part I chose to not include music in the game however this was not so much a design decision as it was a way to save some extra time I still had to create a lot of different sounds though I recorded everything through my microphone did a bit of processing and threw it into unity where I created an audio manager to easily play sounds with a bit of variety from different places in my code I always loved adding sound to my game projects because it's the only part one running mindlessly through my apartment banging on everything I can find to see if it sounds cool finally it was time to create the icon at this point I had pretty much exhausted all my creative resources but somehow I managed to throw something together to wrap things up I created a bunch of builds uploaded them to the website along with the description and a few screenshots this is me submitting the game to the site 3 hours after midnight that was pretty much my experience developing maniac Inc I hope you will enjoy playing it there's a link in the description oh and for the next week or so you can vote on games on the Ludum dare website I really recommend just trying out and voting on a bunch of games a lot of them really fun thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to of the awesome patreon supporters
