hello everyone and welcome to the 16th video in our survival game series done by brackets I am the CEO of trackies and in this video we're going to take a look at all of the borrowing stuff we're gonna take a look at tweaking different mistakes and fixing some stuff so I know it's not that exciting but it has to be done in the next video I promise we are going to take a look at scripting door functionality to a logic so we can have stuff that opens up and also we will implement some GUI to tell the player which buttons he needs to press in order to open it so that's really exciting and it's on its way I promise now as always I've opened up unity and the first thing I want to take a look at is that here under the scripts folder i've gone ahead and dragged the advanced AI from the last tutorial under the scripts folder also i have renamed the raycast shooting with capitals and the weapon switching with capitals and also the spending Crouch from the sprinting tutorial and the crouching tutorial I've gone ahead and drag that into our game also and you can just go ahead and watch the two videos if you want to learn how this was made and it's also included in the assets pack and so that's really awesome in the spinning video we take a look at making the sprinting and in the crouching we take a look at making the crouching and also merging the two so on that's how they work now let's go back to the assets folder and we can go ahead and delete this sprinting and crouching folder here it's the one I used for making the tutorial and yeah awesome so let's go ahead and dive into the first fix I want to select the player and drag in the sprinting ouch there we go and when we had play the game starts playing and when I press see he crouches and when I hold down shift he will sprint so that's working and now let's go ahead and fix the crosshair because you might not have noticed it but the crosshair isn't exactly in the center of the scene it's a little far to the right and a little of fine upwards so if we go ahead and select it we can make sure that it's centered so under the GUI texture under the pixel inset you can see that the x and y are set to zero and now if I you might therefore you might wonder why isn't it centered it's because these two values define the position of the anchor point and the anchor point of the GUI it doesn't have to be in the center with this GUI it is in the lower lefthand corner and so this right here is the center and to fix this we can take the width and the height of the object and divide it by 2 so we get half of the width and half of the height and then subtracted in the x and y values so if I write minus 8 in the X and minus 8 in Y we will now have the GUI centered in the screen so that's it for the GUI now let's move the enemy out of the way because we are not really in the need of an enemy right now so let's just move him over there and the final thing I want to fix in this video is the audio because until now we have had the friendly music playing in the town and the enemy territory playing in another audio zone over here by the enemy and these two audio files are as mentioned earlier not at all good for gaming and game creation they are too long and too large so they are really not optimized for what we're doing here so for now I just want to disable this they will still be included in the Aztecs asset pack so you can include them in your game if you want to though I'm not going to use them here at least not for now so I'll just disable the audio zone optional optimized and I'll go into the audio zone optimized one and here I want to actually keep the audio zone though I want to change the auto clip audio clip because the friendly music is not something I want to use though I have found another piece of audio right here with an ambient sound of a town which we can use until we actually make all of the different little sounds around the town so let me just go ahead and play this so you can have a listen but first I have to enable my my speakers um so it gives me one second okay so I got my speaker's working and now let's have a listen keep in mind that this should only work as a background layer not something that should really stand out so you can hear some wind blowing you can use some people in the background and you can hear some parrots peeping so on that's basically it for the audio file let's just implement this by selecting the audio sound and then dragging in the sound ambience and one more thing if we go ahead and hit play now we can hear the town but it won't pan whenever we change our direction and where we look so let's go ahead and make sure that we can actually hear this by adjusting the pan level so let's make sure that the pan level is somewhat up there we can try to put it at max put it at 100 and this will really give you some panning though I don't know if that's what you want you can get to decide that on your own one thing for sure though is that I want to pimp down the volume quite a bit so that it's only in the background awesome so that was basically it for this video I know it wasn't so exciting it's a little weak though all of this done hat all of this stuff had to be done next one we are going to take a look at making some doors open and close I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll see you in the next one
