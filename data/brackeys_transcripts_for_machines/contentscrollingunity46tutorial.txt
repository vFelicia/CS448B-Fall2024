thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to another video covering the all new unity GUI system introduced with the unity 4.6 beta it's still in public beta and you can download it from unity 3d comm for completely free so today we're going to be covering something quite cool which is the unity scroll rect and this basically allows us to fit more things on the screen so this is what we're going to be making today you can see I have a window with a bunch of text and now we can click and drag this to reveal more we also have a scroll bar that does exactly the same cool so if you have any questions throughout this video please head over to forum Bronchos comm where i am n hmong many other developers are just waiting to answer your questions or to give you feedback or whatever you are looking for it so again head over to forum top bracket comm for any questions whatsoever awesome so let's just get started I'm just going to delete the canvas here that I've made on the event system and we are going to start from fresh so to begin with let's rightclick in the hierarchy let's head under UI and let's create a panel that is going to act as the background of our window so we can just head over into the scene view and focus on this panel that zoom a bit in on it and then maybe let's scale it down position it so it doesn't fit the entire screen here something like this looks pretty okay let's see how it looks in the game view pretty nice we can give it a bit more on the left side there and yeah I'm actually pretty satisfied with that so now let's go ahead and just make a quick label up here with the title so let's right click go in the UI let's select image this time and you will notice that when I rightclick on the panel and then hit image it is automatically parented do that which is pretty cool so once we've created this image what we could go ahead and do is we could move it up here Center our view on it and then just maybe scale it down a bit to make it a bit smaller here just just enough room for a a title of some sort and the problem with the way we've set this up right now is if we go ahead and scale let's say the panel here you can see that our image doesn't correctly follow the border of our panel and the reason why is we are currently anchored to the center of our panel but we actually want to be anchored to the top of our panel so in order to do this we could go ahead and just take this flower here our anchor and move it up or we could use some of the presets over here so click here on the the anchor presets and then simply select the top one here this one make sure that you don't select any stretching or our image is going to stretch with our panel which is really not what we want we want it to be completely centered and only move position wise and not scale now we can go ahead and right click on our image go into UI and select text and let's again go to the anchor presets and this one we want to stretch on both the X and the y so we'll just select the one in the righthand corner and you can see that our anchor has snapped to completely fill out the its parent which is the image and now we can simply just drag this over and scale it to be the size of our image 2 we could set this the numbers up here to 0 manually this is basically serial it's just really really close to that so let's select 0 here and that is a small error with the current with the current beta is that these values up here will not always display complete zero but something extremely close to that I mean this is basically as close to zero as it gets cool so now let's change the text to let's say window you can of course change it to whatever you like and then let's make it a line with the center and align with the middle so here it's it's centered and that's basically all we want to do for the text here you will notice in the game view that this might look a tiny bit blurred the reason why is we have to select our canvas and hit pixel perfect and now everything will look very crisp and sharp cool so now we are actually ready to create the scroll rect itself and in order to do this what I want to do is I want to create basically a parent for all of the text that we are going to be using so let's right click on the panel go on the UI and let's just create an image here because it's so easy to see and let's maybe make sure that this scale is completely with the panel so let's select the anchor preset in the bottom right corner like this and now we can just scale this up a bit something like this looks pretty good and then scale it on the X two and this is what is going to host all of our content for now we can go ahead and disable the image here and let's just rename this to scroll rect then we're going to go ahead and hit add a component to this called UI and then scroll rect and we're going to leave it with everything as is for now this is not going to work yet then we're going to rightclick on the scroll rect itself hit a hit on the UI and select the text and let's just make this again scale with its parent so select the bottom right anchor preset now let's make sure that the left is tab is zero position Z of 0 and a right and bottom of zero so it's completely filling out its parent now we can go ahead and make some text for this and I've just gone ahead ahead and found a random text generator so here I'm just going to paste this in you can do whatever you want here and you can see that this text easily overflows the the scroll rect here so what we can do is we can simply scale this down and this paragraph is really long I'm just going to scale it to here or something and and now what we want to do is we want to tell the scroll rect that this is the content that we wanted to well scroll so let's select the scroll rect let's drag the text under the content and just release and that was basically it now when we hit play we can see that when we can drag this with our mouse and it will actually work now there is a problem with this and that is that our text is currently overflowing you can see that it's not being masked out so it's it's basically visible on the entire screen and that's really annoying so to make this more clear I'm just going to go ahead and make this text completely white so it's just a bit more apparent and then what we can do is we can select the scroll rect and add yet another component but in order for this component to work we're going to have to enable the image because we're going to be adding what is called a UI mask and a mask takes in some kind of image it takes a sprite that we can then mask with so let's hit add component you whoops you I and then mask and then we have the ability to simply disable the mask graphic so simply hit disable the show mask graphic see our text appears again it's very important that you use this to disable the image and not this up here or we're not even going to see our content cool so now when we hit play everything works just as expected one last final detail that we can add to this is a scroll bar and this is actually really easy all we have to do is rightclick on the panel hidden under UI and select scroll bar and now we can go ahead and make this a bottom two tab so we don't scroll horizontally then we can maybe set the width to 20 and the height we're going to bump that up let's also move it over here maybe we can make this element snap to the right hand side so let's just set the anchor preset to the right hand side here no scaling or actually do we want this to scale yeah we can scale with this so let's just make it scale on the right and then we can just scale it up here manually to fit and this actually looks pretty good let's just move it in here actually I scaled it a bit too much it's better I think if it just fits the content and that's basically it so let's try and hit play here and indeed we have a scroll bar but it is actually still not working so what we need to do in order to get this to work and this is what I notice that most people forget is to go under the scroll rect and then drag the scroll bar under the vertical scroll bar make sure it's the vertical or it's going to behave really really so just drag it under there and one thing we can also do is disable horizontal movement so we make sure that this will only move vertically now when we hit play you can see that we can use the scroll bar to adjust what part of the text we we are viewing one thing I really like to do with scroll bars is I like to select it and then disable the background image and only have the handle the handle can be adjusted under this scroll bar sliding area and then handle and I also normally like to turn that down a bit so the so that the scroll bar doesn't take up so much of the window cool so that was basically it for today's video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one
