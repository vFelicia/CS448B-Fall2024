no everyone will come to this bonus video in our survival game series done by Brad keys I am the CEO Frankie's and in this video we're gonna take a look at how to download input and used the survival game assets which you can download from our website for free so if you've if you think you are stuck in a matter you can't get the scripting to work or if you just want to use some of the sounds or models or something like that used in the videos you can always get them for free on our website so I am making this video because you guys requested me to do so alright so if you already know how to import the assets are not really interested in them you can just go ahead and skip this video it's all we're gonna cover here so first of all let's go to our website so open up your browser and you can see that I am here and practice calm and first I want to mention before we get started that these things are available for free and so we do not profit off of them if you want to support what we do you can always go to the donate section and you can decide completely how much you want to donate and if you want to at all but of course we would love it if you did and if you don't that's completely fine too so now let's go ahead and hit the download survival assets button which is located in the middle of the homepage I'm thinking about redesigning the website a little bit but it should like somewhat somewhat similar in the future it's you you can also click on the banner here to get into our survival game series page and download them from there but hit the download asset use a used button this shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes and I have downloaded it already here you go so this version is the version 8 survival assets 8 and when you just download the assets they in a compressed format to be more specific they are in a dot RAW format and the dot raw or raw what every however you want to say it it's used for making folders into just one file so that's what I've done here and so you would need to decompress or uncompress the file before we can use the assets and this is done using a program that is free to download so if you're on a Mac you could go ahead and find the program in the app store called an archiver or if you're on a Windows computer like I am now you can go ahead and search for winrar and from the role apps and download the version that fits your computer and so when you have done that it shouldn't be harder than rightclicking the file and hit the extract to survival assets zero eight and now Vinh raw will create a folder for us called survival assets and on the Mac it should be pretty much as easy I'm sure there are plenty of guides on how to do it it's just opening the file with an archiver and it will do the same so if we double click the survival assets whoops actually two folders now then you in that case you can just go ahead and hit the extract here instead so inside of this we have quite a few things we have quite a few folders so first one is audio and inside of the audio folder you will find stuff like the music that we used and the town ambience which is also used in the game and inside of the GUI we have a Photoshop file containing the crosshair inside of the imports we have all of the different UVs and textures used for the weapons and models and then we have a folder called materials containing all of the day from material data for the different models and then we have both the FBX files for import into unity if you don't have Maya or if you have Maya you can just use these Maya files and you can then also edit them inside of Maya so keep in mind that you can always make changes to the models that we use and that I create and everything you get in this pack feel free to use it for both the commercial and just educational purposes you can make a profit off of these as long as you don't state that they you are the one who made them so okay so we have the scripts folder which should be pretty selfexplanatory and then the different textures so as always I've opened up unity and here we are and to import stuff in here all you have to do is go and find the element you want to import for example the crosshair and then just drag it in and there you go and then you can fiddle around with the import settings this is a crosshair so we want to change it to GUI and hit apply and now this should wake just as well as the one I used in the video so if you are uncertain about how you would import the different assets go back and watch the different videos I should explain most of it under the imports we have the different models and in here these are a little harder to understand so I'm just gonna quickly show you how I would do this so I would go into the unity and create a new folder just to make sure that I have everything inside of in just one place and I would call this well I would call it imports for now let's just call it test and then double click it and then we can go ahead and import let's say we want to import the doors so I will take the door you read UV normalmap the wall all of these and drag them in and then unisza will process it and imported itself and if you are having problems it can be a good idea not to drag them in but instead right click in the project pane hit the import import new assets and then find them and import them and then let's go into the FBX files and drag in the door and there you go unity has pretty much taken care of everything and this might be because I've done this before but let me just show you how I would set this up so I would change the scale factory depending on how big the door is when I drag it in so if I just drag this into the scene you can see that the door is way too small so I would select it in the project pane and change the scale factory to something like 1 or is 0.5 let's try that now it's actually pretty huge but it's close enough so the rest we can just scale inside of unity and there you go and if you're having problems with naming and stuff don't name them inside of the project pane name them inside of unity instead so that's or inside of the scene instead so that just name this door wall and the other one we would then name door door sorry I know and and so this would work and a good thing to remember is that unless you are importing something with with animation which we don't have here we create the animations inside of unity so it's a good idea to hit the object and run the import settings go under both Rick and hit none and then apply and then animations and uncheck the import animation and just really be careful with these settings take a good look at them and and so this should work really fine and then using you could create some colliders inside of unity which we also have a tutorial on called mastering collision and that's basically it for the videos guys for some of you this might have been really self explanatory but I've just gotten a bunch of questions asking me on how to do this so I thought I would clear things up and so there you go I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll see you in the next one
