lower one over come to the best modeling programs for unity Dunbar brackets I am the CEO of brackets and in this video we are going to take a look at choosing a modeling program to suit your unity workflow keep in mind that this video is based on my own personal experience and therefore you might not agree with me entirely though this should help you get an idea of what software to pick I made this video because a lot of you have requested me to do so now let's get started with what I like to use I prefer a piece of software in the little more expensive region called autodesk maya the firm autodesk is huge in the city computer graphics and similar sation world and I personally like Maya because it's well documented Etna has very few limitations and also it works well with unity but we'll get into that in a second first I want to show you how the interface and the UI looks and so here's how it looks and first thing you will notice is there are a lot and lots of buttons and it can look even worse than this but I think that the interface is pretty intuitive and they is a logic to it so once you get into the mindset of Maya you will start to figure things out though it's definitely not for the complete beginners so let's move on to talk about how it implements with unity so the good thing about Maya is that I don't even have to export the model into an FBX and then import it into unity you can just save it in Maya format directly like you could see min doing here and then and then just load it up in unity and it will work and if you want to make changes you can just double click the file in the project pane and it will then open up in Maya and you can make changes and Maya can be very hard to learn because it has so it is so complex and has so many features so for complete beginners often too much to take in an alternative Tamiya is another Autodesk program called 3ds max and we'll get into that in just a second first of all I want to show you how Maya exports into unity so you can see here that in can save in the maya maya file with both messages textures animation data and wreaking or bones so you can make a complete character in maya and just export them directly into unity you can also export to the FBX which is also made by autodesk and it will also store all of the different data though the DAAD maya works completely fine so it's a little easier to handle now let's move on to the 3ds max max is really great and it's often considered to be more effective for creating low polygon models which is what you need in the game industry both programs are great though and it really depends on what sued YouTube the best let's have a look at the interface this is how it looks so you can see it looks a little different in this picture I wasn't working with anything at all so it does look a little more scraped but I would think that they are pretty much on the same level my personal opinion though is that 3ds max is a little easier to learn for modeling purposes it is still really expensive though just like Maya you remember that you can get unlimited trial time on that website on both Max and Maya but watch out it's only for educational purposes you cannot use it to make a profit so here's where you can where you can download it on their website and it's only for educational use now let's move on to see how it exports into unity just like Maya you can exported in its own file format with both meshes textures animation data and raking and it also exports to FBX so um it's really awesome to work with unity and 3ds max at the same time and awesome free alternative to all of the Autodesk stuff is blender then there is an open source modeling program and game as an engine as well that means that it's free and I've worked with blender a lot of them in the past this is how it looks and I found the modeling tools to be really great for the more serious modeler because the interface is very hard to figure out I think it's pretty cryptic and I couldn't really wrap my head around it and also it can be very distracting with having a game engine in the same program that you're modeling because there are a lot of buttons that you don't want to use and stuff like that so I keep in mind that for the again complete beginner blender is often too much and though it is really really powerful and let's move on and see how it exports with the unity so you can see that it can export in its own blender format with with all of the dates are needed though it cannot export to FBX anymore on that feature was removed a couple of updates ago anyway let's move on to the more easy to use software and here we have wings 3d which is also free and it's really really focusing on modeling it's it's pretty much designed to do modeling only and therefore it's the easiest to learn and the interface is Parrish grapes you the user don't have to learn hundreds of key bindings to do basic actions like inserting an edge loop or extruding a face everything is pretty much done through the interface and that through hotkeys and key bindings the downside to wings 3d is that it could be a pairing to do with later on basically the only format that works between unity and wings 3d is wavefront or what's known as obj you can see it here and it works without texture data animation or reking so it's only modeling it sets on the Unity website though that it should be able to export to FBX though I've never been able to make it work because the creators of wings later remove the feature wings is really good for doing stuff like texture work it's not it's really no good for doing stuff like texture work or animation either so it's recommended that you do this in a separate program wings is with all of the flaws the faster program to modeling that's just how it is so it's very fast here we have a picture of a model that one of our 3d modelers made and this was done in just 60 minutes and I don't know if this picture really shows all of the detail that went into this but it will get you an idea of just how fast you can work in wings now moving on to an alternative to wings 3d also for the beginner we have cheetah 3d which is one of the cheaper modeling programs and it reminds me a lot of wings 3d though without many of the floors cheetah 3d is easy and fun to use it costs only $99 and here is the interface so you can have a look you can see that the the interface is very scraped there's not much to it and I was able to learn how to use this for basic modeling in about an hour or so so that's really really great though it is Mac only so that's a bummer e for the Windows users that was basically oh yeah let's just talk about how exports it exports in the cheetah 3d format with every piece of data that you can think of and I'm pretty sure it also exports to the FBX so that's great for the exporting purposes it will work fine with unity that's it for the modeling software overview let's just take a quick walkthrough of what we have talked about so to sum up my is great for modeling texturing rigging and animating but hard to learn and expensive if you're not a student 3ds max is much like maya though it suits some people better and some people worse you'll have to figure that out on your own blender is some free and very deep program for doing modeling but some guests get lost in the many features wings 3d is the easiest of them although it has its limitations and cheetah 3d is really good for beginners but unfortunately only available for Mac users good luck in choosing the right one for you I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll see you in the next one you
