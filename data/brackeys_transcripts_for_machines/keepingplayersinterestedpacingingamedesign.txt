the most important thing when making a game is of course the actual content the gameplay the story the audio and the graphics but if you don't know how to present these things in a way that is interesting to the player they might find that they lose interest no matter how cool your game is and a key element when it comes to keeping players hooked is pacing so in this video we'll explore how you can use pacing to keep your players engaged but first this video is sponsored by Dennis pan Judah then this is an awesome game dev tutor who's just updated his super successful complete csharp master class this class will make you feel super comfortable writing code in csharp and using it for programming your own games in unity it will give you knowledge on many different aspects of csharp and teach topics such as databases link in WPF and much more at the end of the course you will even have made three games on your own if this sounds like something you're interested in simply click the link in the description to get started and get a massive discount so there are basically two parts to pacing in video games one is the typical narrative tension curve of the plot or how the story evolves throughout the game the other is the rhythm of the game play or how shifts in tempo and intensity affect the experience in terms of narrative many of the best stories can be plotted into graphs similar to this one with a steady rise and tension set up confrontation and then resolution an introduction to the world and the main character is followed by an establishment of the conflict leading to a climax resolving that conflict but it's actually not usually this simple instead of a constantly rising linear graph it's more like a fluctuating line with its own small attention curves along the surface the overall tension is still increasing up until the resolution but a great story has sub conflicts to resolve along the way imagine if Frodo just wandered into Mordor and threw the ring into the fiery depths of Mount Doom without any obstacles along his way pretty boring but when it comes to Story games usually have more in common with a TV series or a book just like games both of these media are constructed to keep the consumer engaged for as long as possible and not necessarily in one sitting unless of course you've bench watch an entire season of Game of Thrones in two days not that I've ever done that anyway many TV shows build their episodes around a template that looks like this they build tension and then totally ruin it all with commercial breaks however after the break we're still there the reason for this is the constant use of cliffhangers which is a concept that works just as well when applied to game design I'm not saying that this is always the best way to create a great tension curve cliffhangers can work but if they're overused they're bound to get predictive and annoying with delicate use however small intensity spikes in the narrative can be very effective at keeping the player engaged throughout the course of your game if used well it'll spice up the overall experience without getting obnoxious so definitely keep this in mind but narrative is one thing what about gameplay well when pacing your gameplay a very important factor is a rhythm rhythm the first two the balance between various gameplay types for example a game might have slower tempo sections like puzzles dialogue or exploration which make a nice contrast to higher tempo sections such as combat and racing it's important to alternate between different kinds of gameplay because playing through long stretches of slow gameplay becomes boring while getting challenged at high intensity for a long time becomes exhausting of course one of the tools at your disposal in terms of balancing more or less intense gameplay is difficulty in fact we just made a separate video on difficulty in video games so check that out in case you haven't seen it now halflife 2 you for example and valve games in general are great at controlling the rhythm throughout the game intense combat gameplay is often followed by calmer exploration or puzzle elements never sticking to the same type of gameplay for too long for example in chapter 3 of halflife 2 Gordon the main character obtains his first weapon and really puts it to use as he fights through the canals in this fairly combat heavy section the players fighting skills are put to the test for the first time Gordon walks through thin and claustrophobic corridors with combines manhacks zombies and aliens lurking around every corner which makes the whole section quite tense the next part though is a slowpaced roaming and extra section with occasional puzzles the world is no longer a bunch of claustrophobic corridors but instead a big open area and all you have to do is just Cruise in your airboat and take in the view this is a huge contrast from before both in terms of pacing and scenery which serves as a great breathing room before the action rises once again so the halflife franchise really nails tension and release which is why the games are often very hard to put down but pacing narrative and gameplay aren't the only things that go into keeping players engaged just as important is creating a sense of progression progression is strongly related to what is referred to as the reward schedule in other words we want to think about how and when we reward the player to give them a sense of achievement and make them feel they've really earned the progression they've made keep in mind that rewards in this sense doesn't just mean big loot drops or new abilities a reward could also be a progression in the story or getting to visit a new level and here timing is key giving too few rewards or spacing them out too much candy moralize the player and they may start to feel like they aren't progressing on the other hand giving the player too many rewards or rewarding trivial tasks will lessen the impact of each and diminish this sense of achievement striking the perfect balance in the reward schedule is not easy and in the end it's all about psychology and how the brain gets affected when playing the game I think we've all had experience with games particularly in the casual mobile market that I designed primarily to be addictive without much thought to the content of the game itself these games might be extremely good at keeping players hooked but I think it's a shame that many developers are stuck trying to optimize retention instead of getting to utilize their skills to create meaningful experiences that's set thinking about how you pace your rewards is important for almost any game and you should also think about not holding back on rewards that are important to the way your game plays again halflife 2 is a great example valve initially planned the gravity gun to be used only in the last sections of the game but found that players had so much fun with the mechanic that they decided to give the gun to players much earlier even though it meant they had to go back and restructure a bunch of their levels now another great way of keeping players engaged is with anticipation this means presenting the player with something that they are unable to obtain yet this can go hand in hand with rewards say if you disclose to the player that at a certain amount of XP something cool will be unlocked this happens every time you glance at the skill list in RPG games such as horizon zero dawn or when you start thinking up the perfect combination of skills and items in games like path of Exile fantasizing about rewards long before they are available essentially prolongs the time in which the player is enjoying them and it also gives the player achievable goals which can offer incentive to keep playing I have spent countless hours in Excel or external build and planning tools thinking up the most crazy builds for characters in games 8 imply that ignites himself in order to damage enemies around him in path of Exile or an agent that specializes in tech to heal his allies in the division 2 games like these have been on my mind for hours even while not playing of course creating custom builds like this might be a bit too daunting or nerdy for most players but giving the players some sort of ingame goal is always a great motivator now sometimes anticipation can be set up more like a mystery something that intrigues the player but without them knowing exactly what is to come I think a good example of this is the Dark Portal in World of Warcraft here players are limited to explore the main world of Azeroth for almost 60 levels during this entire time every time they open their map they can see another world called Outland but the actual contents of the world is greyed out only when they reach level 58 two players get to enter the dark portal and they immediately transported to a huge new area that they get to explore in fact Blizzard uses this extensively involved of Warcraft and the same applies to each of their higher level sounds the trick to making this work is setting up a scenario that seems intriguing the curiosity drives the player to keep playing because they just have to discover something new and unravel the mystery me congratulations was it worth it of course a huge dark portal definitely helps with this and we actually see this a lot in the Lego games as well during the main campaign of Lego Star Wars for example you'll encounter areas that you cannot yet reach however later in the game you unlock new characters that have the ability to open specific doors or jump higher in order to reach those areas that were previously unavailable but some games handle engagement and anticipation in a completely different way in Minecraft there's no specified ingame goal or there wasn't before the ender dragon was introduced but minecraft was compelling long before this and still is today in fact many people still haven't completed the game and they don't really care too much about finishing so what makes minecraft so engaging to just play well you might think that a game like minecraft has no real progression and therefore no opportunity for the developer to control the pacing but not the creative minecraft has crafted a world where the player is free to fabricate their own story and their own progression many players first goal is to survive the night but from here the sky's the limit some players goal might be to build a beautiful house while others choose to spend time creating the most optimal system to craft and handle resources and if they get bored of the current gameplay loop the player can just change up the gameplay themselves had enough of mining let's go hunting for some food so this structure and presentation of a game is just as important as the content itself turns out they go hand in hand you can create a game with great combat mindboggling puzzles and snappy controls and it will feel great for a while but with poor structure and presentation it will never really shine so hopefully this video has given you some good ideas on how to paste narrative and gameplay in a way that is interesting to the player if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe and bring that notification about so don't miss the next one also make sure to check out the
