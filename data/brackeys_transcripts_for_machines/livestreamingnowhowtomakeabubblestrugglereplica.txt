hello one just want to let you know that I will be livestreaming in just a moment over on Twitch it's going to be really fun today I'm really looking forward to it basically what we're going to be making is kind of a bubble struggle replicant if you're not familiar with bubble struggle I'm just gonna show you what it is we aim to create so this is something that I just prepared for this video and you can see there's this ball jumping around and if we hit it with our arrow here that we can decide when we want to shoot it we'll split in two and it will keep doing that until we reach kind of the final one that is small enough that we can just pop it and if we get hit by one of these balls it's just going to start over and we lost the game and this is something that's really really fun because it's it's really really simple to set up initially but you can do a lot of things with it and there's a lot of stuff that you can customize without writing any code you can see here are my four ball prefabs and they basically just link to each other and we can have several others in there you can customize different properties such as mass and speed and start forests and colors all that to make the game varied and fun and create a lot of levels really quickly and of course we're going to be creating some the basic player controls setting everything up from scraps scratch so I really hope to see you over there at the end we are also going to do a live Q&A as we've done the other times it's always a blast so if you're ending in any way interested that's awesome and I look forward to seeing you there in case you missed it it will also be live on the YouTube channel as soon as I kind of package it up and maybe cut out a few embarrassing pipes so yeah it will be on the channel as well so yeah I look forward to seeing you there and I'll see you in a second
