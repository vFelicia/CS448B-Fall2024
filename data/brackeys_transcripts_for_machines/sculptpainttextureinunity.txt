one of the biggest pain points for a lot of unit users has always been the lack of powerful artist friendly toes luckily the wait is over unity has acquired poly brush and pro builder which are two really powerful assets for building levels inside of the unity editor poly brush is still in beta but it already has a bunch of great tools for sculpting painting texturing and quickly adding prefabs to your levels so in this video we'll have a look at how to use it also special thanks to encode we trust patrick mckinley diego frank tristan down died when buffy o infinity PPR and yo Rio mer for their support on patreon and with that let's get painting so to start using poly brush we need to make sure that we included in our project at the time of recording this video it's available on github of course have a link to it in the description along with this example scene now once you have the tools installed we can go to the top here and go into tools poly brush and open up the poly brush window and right away this window pops up we can put it somewhere in the unity editor or we can right click on it and hit open as floating window and then we can have it kind of to the side of our scene view here and right away now if we select a mesh in our scenes I'm gonna select my example plane here and hover over it we can see that our brush appears if I hold down left mouse I can actually sculpt this plane but depending on the lighting environment the changes can be pretty hard to see so what I like to do is normally go to the top left corner and change from shaded to shaded wireframe this helps show what's happening whenever we sculpt our mesh I do however want to make the wireframe a bit more transparent luckily we can quickly do this by going edit preferences then selecting colors and if we scroll to the bottom there's one here called wireframe overlay here we can change the color of it I'm just gonna keep this black but we can also reduce our alpha there we go so it's just a subtle effect let's then close down our preferences and now we're ready to go through the different tools at our disposal at the very top here you can choose what painting mode you want to use currently Wayne sculpting mode which allows us to push and pull vertices so here by simply clicking we can create Hills and if we hold down ctrl while clicking we can go ahead and push the vertices back in then we of course have all of our brush settings and these are pretty much the same for all of our tools here we can control the outer radius of our brush we can either control this using the slider as you can see I've just made it a lot bigger or we can hold down control and scroll in order to change it we can also change the inner radius of our brush using this slider here or we could simply hold down shift and scroll if we fully increase our inner radius we'll get a very hard brush and if we decrease it we'll get a much softer brush finally we can control the strength of our brush by using this slider in the middle here we can also hold down both control and shift while scrolling in order to change it of course the greater the strength the more we will influence the terrain while sculpting when we are satisfied with our brush settings we also have some settings for how we want to push and pull here we can choose whether or not we want to ignore open edges you can see with this enabled we won't actually be able to change the height of the sides of our plane here whereas if I change that we can clearly influence that as well I'm just gonna leave that on for now we also have a setting called brush normal is sticky with this enabled if we place our brush somewhere on the mesh and click and drag will change all the vertices in the same direction as when we started whereas if we disable this the brush will go ahead and change them in the direction that it's currently facing at all times we can also change the direction that we want to use here we can use either the brush normal which is just the way that the brush is facing another option is vertex normal which will pull each one of the vertices in their current direction so you can see here what that does or we can choose a given direction if we wanted to pull over the C's to the right here we could do that I'm just going to leave this add brush normal and finally the brush effect allows us to control the overall strength of our brush most of the time we just use the strength to finetune this but if you're working with a very large or very small model you might want to go and adjust the brush effect and now we've actually created some detail to our plane however when sculpting we often end up with these fairly hard edges luckily poly brush has a two for smoothing these out to select this tool we click on the second icon up here now I'm gonna increase the strength of my brush here and you can see right away when we start painting it kind of smooths out our entire surface and now it actually looks much better and more natural one of the cool things about poly brush is that it doesn't only work on flat planes we can use it to sculpt and paint any kind of mesh for example if we're working with a sphere I can go under the scope tool and now we can actually sculpt directly on the sphere so this opens up a world of possibility for now let's go back to our example plane and the last thing that I want to show you before we move on to coloring is brush mirroring these are the settings right here in the middle of our window this of course allows us to mirror changes over a certain axis say we wanted to mirror on the X I'm gonna select X here and now whenever we paint we do so on both sides of the plane in fact we can mirror on multiple axes at once if we select both X and Z here you can see that poly brush will automatically paint on both axes so that's pretty cool now the third tool here is used for painting vertex colors of course in order to see our painting we need to make sure we have a material applied to our object that supports vertex colors right now it's notifying us down here that we don't so I'm gonna select my material that I currently have applied here I'm gonna go to the top to change the shader I'm gonna go into a poly brush here we have a bunch of different shaders available you can read more about what each one does in the documentation in my case I'm just gonna select diffuse vertex color now right away our plane turns white I'm gonna select it again and now when we hover over it we can see that we can actually paint with this green color so I'm gonna go ahead and paint the hills green here we can control the color at the bottom here so I'm gonna go and find some kind of brown and if you find a color that you like you can always hit the plus sign in order to add it to the palette and if you make a palette that you want to save you can always go to red says default and create new palettes with different colors in each one in fact we can do the same thing with our brush setting so if we really like the configuration of the brush we would go to the top here and add new brushes and you can always press this button here to save your current settings so now I'm going to increase the strength of my brush here and I'm gonna paint in some Brown and finally I'm gonna select a light blue and I'm gonna decrease the size of my brush and paint that in down here I'm also going to go in here and add a tiny bit of detail with the green and I'm gonna do the same thing with a light orange so now we have something that somewhat resembles some kind of island like structure I will have to excuse my artistic talent here but I hope you get the idea under our paint settings we can also change from brush mode into fill if we increase the strength here to 1 you can see using fill we can paint directly on top of vertices without any kind of smoothing and we can also change to flood which is going to affect our entire mesh then the next tool in the list is the paint prefabs tool we use this for easily distributing prefabs over all level this is great for adding lots of smaller detail pieces such as foliage which can take painfully long if you do it by hand here we have all these standard brush settings and then at the bottom here we have a place where we can drag in prefabs so I've gone ahead and prepared three rock variations that we can use so I'm just gonna drag them in one by one and we can see them displayed here we then select one of them I'm gonna select the one in the middle and we should then be able to paint these on top of our model I think the density is currently way too much so I'm gonna undo this and I'm definitely gonna decrease the strength of my brush and now we're painting much fewer onto the environment another neat feature is that we can place multiple rocks at once by holding down shift and selecting more of them and now we can easily scatter rocks of different sizes throughout our environment we also have a few placement settings that we can configure you can choose whether or not we want to use the pivot of the object when determining how to place it in my case I've gone ahead and prepared a pivot that makes sense so I want that enabled another important setting is the hit surface is parent which when it is enabled we'll go ahead and place all the objects under the surface that we paint this is great for not cluttering your hierarchy and finally if you want to avoid overlap you can turn this on as well so now I'm just gonna place a few rocks around the environment here and I would say that that looks good but I know it doesn't so I'm just gonna pretend that I don't care and the final tool that we have at our disposal is the texture paint tool if we select this we get another warning saying that our material currently doesn't support it so let's again go to our plain material well then go to the top here and go and do a poly brush and let's select standard texture blend here we can give it some different textures to use for the base color I'm just gonna choose the grass then as texture one I'm gonna select dirt texture two I'm gonna select the ground texture that I have and protector three let's go ahead and choose sand if we then go and select our poly brush tool and select the example plane we actually see the different textures that we have to choose from I'm gonna select the grass here increase the strength to one as well as bump up the size of our brush then I'm gonna change to the flood tool and I'm gonna select the model to make everything grass I think this will act as a nice space we then go and select our second texture I'm gonna go back to the brush tool now I want to place this on these sides here there we go I'm also going to lick the ground texture here that's placed that in the middle let's also try and grab the sand texture I'm gonna decrease the strength of the brush and the radius I'm gonna try and paint this in to kind of smooth out the texture transition here as well as down here so once again I know this is not pretty but we've actually managed to both sculpt smooth paint detail and texture and objects in a matter of just minutes so I think this tool is really really cool and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what you guys will make of it hopefully you are better artists than I am in fact if you make something cool using this tool make sure to share it with me on Twitter at bracket Street and the final thing that I wanted to mention is that if we go to the very last button here there are a bunch of general set that you can configure so if you're using the tool a lot definitely experiment with these to best suit your workflow that's pretty much all I wanted to cover in this video now I expect a lot of this stuff is going to change over the next few months as the acid is being rapidly worked on so definitely stay tuned for that also let me know if you would like to see a tutorial on pro builder as well on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in February and especially thanks to
