thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to the third video in how to program in C sharp today we are going to be making a simple calculator as I explain things such as declaring variables datatypes and variable initialization so that's super awesome and and we're going to lay the foundation today of pretty much every single program that you're ever going to write cool so let's just go and start it by opening up summer in studio and as you can see I've written out the challenge from the last videos let's just quickly go through this ask you to print out your name and age then wait some user input then print out your favorite color and then again wait some user input so this is done by first making a console.writeline saying that my name is Espeon and i am 17 years old then I'm just telling the user here to press the spacebar to continue then I'm waiting for a key this can be any key but it looks prettier with the spacebar and then we write out the favorite color and before that I've put a back backslash N and in the last video I kept saying reverse backslash it's of course just backslash or reverse if you want which is going to make a new line so it we're just going to put some more space between them and then we're going to wait some it user input again let's just try and run this program you can say see it says my name and my age and it says press space to continue once I do that my favorite color appears cool so let me just go ahead and delete that for now because we're not going to be needing that I just wanted to show you how things are done again if you don't want to wait for the next video to complete a challenge or if there's just something you don't can't get to work just please feel free to ask a question or web forum top brackets to come there are so many people ready to answer your questions and I'm always here too so it's the best place to get answers cool so let's go ahead and make our calculator so what are we going to be needing well for calculator we need to store some user input so far we've only been waiting for it and then not really used to user input for anything other than to wait for it so now we are just going to try and store this in a box basically what we call a variable so what variables are are basically containers that you can put information and then access later or maybe even change a note this also I'm very abstract because these boxes come in different shapes and if the value you are trying to put in the box doesn't have the same shape it's going to throw an error and that's where data types come in so I'm going to explain that in a sec first let me just show you the syntax for creating a variable so for now we're just going to type var and then we're going to type the name of the variable and in our case this is going to be num1 for a number 1 but this can be anything you want as long as it doesn't start with a number I'm pretty sure and you can remember also that it's that capitalization is is important it's case sensitive and then we can simply type what we want this value to be so we could type here maybe we want this to start out at 10 this is where we could also put some user input instead if we want the user to define what the variable is is equal to but we actually don't have to give it a number from the beginning this line here alone is not valid and the reason why is because when we type var it's just going to predict what type of variable it's going to be depending on what we equal it to so if we equal it to 10 it knows that it's a number without decimal points and that is what be in programming called an int or an integer so the very sign here basically just says that we don't want to tell it what the type is we just wanted to find out itself once we are initialized but that's not really good programming practice because that can throw lots of problems and it makes code harder to read this is what I call is called implicit variable declaration what we can also do is what is what's called explicit variable declaration which is good to just get used to you from the start and that basically means that instead of typing bar we just directly type the type of variables that we want to declare so let's say that we want to make a number but we don't already know that this is going to what this is going to be equal to well then we can simply type int for a number without decimal points and then we can delete this and now it's actually completely valid that actually completely valid this is just the variable declaration then later we can take this num1 and we can equal it to let's say 20 and this is completely fine here we declare the variable and here we initialize it I just want you to get familiar with some of these terms because I'm going to be using them a lot and just try and remember them for now and then later you can maybe use them on your own so we're going to make a number one but there are also other types of variables this here the data type comes in many different shapes and forms we also have what is called a float which is basically a decimal point numbers so we are just going to call this decimal point and we're going to equal this to let's say ten point four so that what that's what you do with floats you do also sometimes sees what is called a double and that's basically just a float but with more precision then we also have a see here we also have a pool which is short for boolean and that's basically a value a variable that can either be true or false just like you might know that computers are built up around zeros and ones this values is basically the same but instead of calling it 0 & 1 we just call it true and false so this is just true or false and it's going to be equal to true in this case then at last we have what is called a string this is a string and this is basically what used for characters sentences or words if it's just one single character you need to store you can type char instead but we are just going to be using string most of the time so this could be a sentence and it's equal to hello world so that's some examples for the different that datatypes and their usage points now let's get actually into how we can can use this to create our calculator so first thing we're going to do is we're going to declare the first value and then we're going to declare another one called number two and now we're going to tell the user that he should type some number so basically what we're going to do is we're going to have the user type a number for the number one and then we are going to have them type a number for number two and we're going to multiply them and print out the answer so now we've declared the two variables we can now initialize them using some user input so we are going to type console dot write line actually let's just do write and I'm going to show you why just in a sec here so let's do you console that right and let's type type a number to be multiplied like this and the reason why we use concept I'll write instead of red line is because then we can have the number that is typed on the same line so when we then do console dot read line here that number is going to appear right after this sentence but right now when we will run the program you can see that we can type in a number and it enter and it just closes and it says here that the variable number one is declared but never used and the same with number two and that's because we have to actually tell it that we want the number one to equal this console that real line so we're going to say number one equals console that read line but this is going to throw us an error because the computer assumes that the console that we read line is a string remember what the string is a string is basically a sentence is a series of characters and it does that because we it can both be a string or just a number or a float it can be many types of variables inside of a string so what we need to do is we need to convert this into a number we need to tell it that we are expecting a number here and not a string so to do this we use the convert function so we can type convert dot to int and you can see that there are multiple different types of in seer and just like we have float and double there are multiple types of int for precision basically how long the integers can't that the value the number is going to be and the default one is just 32 so we're just going to type two int 32 and then we're going to wrap this concert that read line in parenthesis so now and I know this was a lot now we've actually gone ahead and declared two we've written out something to the council we've stored the user input in the first value by converting it to a number from a string so I know this was was probably quite a lot but if you can just at least type after me in the beginning here then you might go ahead and understand it fully later so when we now go ahead and hit play we're not going to see anything change we can go out and type 230 we're not going to see anything change but we don't get this error up here and we can now do things with this value here like double it or multiply it with another value which we are going to go ahead and do so now we're just going to do a console dot right again we're going to say type another number like this and then we're going to say that number 2 equals convert dot to int 32 and inside of this we are going to type console dot readline just like the line up here oops you need to put open and close parenthesis after the console that read line because remember that is a method and whenever we call a method we need we need parentheses cool so now we should see this error here disappear also this morning and we can go ahead and do something with these numbers and what we can do is actually really simple and you can get creative with this we can say console dot write line and we can say the result is like this and when then we do plus num1 times and simply use the star symbol here num2 and when we close this off and play type a number two be multiplied I'm going to do 25 type another number I'm going to do two and now it says very quickly that the number is 50 but remember again we always have to wait user input before the console closest on Windows so we're going to do console dot read key here so that it won't just quickly closed on us so now we can run through this and I promise you it will work this time we can say 30 times maybe 5 this 150 so there you go you've actually now made your first calculator your first valid program that that the user can now interact with so that was it on variables and how we use them and how to create basic functionality in a program I'm going to gonna go ahead and give you a second challenge here because so many of you love the last one so what I want you to do till next time is I want you to again type in write a program that will allow the user to divide two numbers and I'm just going to tell you that the division operator is a dash so I want you to write a program where the user can divide two numbers and whenever you print the result I want you to print out not only the result but also the two numbers that the user put in meaning that you should have a sentence that says this number divided by this number is equal to and then the result so I'm going to go ahead and let you figure out what how you can do that and then I'm going to show you in the next video should you find it difficult or or anything I know that this is all very new but I promise you that this almost becomes like a second language if you just practice it enough it's hard for everyone in the beginner but it won't stay that way cool so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
