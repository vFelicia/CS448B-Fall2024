hello 1 and welcome to the fourth tutorial in the create a survival game series done by Brad keys I am the CEO of practice and today we are going to take a look at creating some animation for our character and this might be quite a long process so I don't know if I can fit it all into this tutorial but we'll see so I've opened up my unity project and before we get started I just want to fix a few things so first of all doubleclick on the standard assets folder double click on the character controllers and now go ahead and just delete the third person controller we don't really need this it's just taking up space and if you want you can go into the skyboxes and delete the skyboxes if you don't need I'm just gonna leave them there if I decide to change it later on we can delete them when we're done ok so I just want to make a some folders for our scripts and our animations to make it a little bit more organized so rightclick in the assets window in the project panel and create folder and then I'm going to rename this to scripts and I'm going to drag the two scripts in that folder and make one more for the animation so animations I'm going to drag the attack into that folder ok great so first of all we'll need a idle animation so if we go under play and main camera and select our melee this is where the melee system script is hatched and under the melee is our maze and simply what we're going to do is we're going to place all the different animations on the different weapons because some some weapons might be heavier heavier and then neat others kinds of animation slower animations and stuff like that so individual animations for individual weapons and what we're going to do is we're going to open up the animation panel I have it down here in the project pane but you can go to window and then just hit animation or press control 6 okay so now where it says attack you can click that and click create new clip and just call this for idle and then hit save and hit the record button and I'm going to make a curves in the position Y and I'm going to also in the yes in the position Y and I'm gonna drag this about 4 seconds into the timeline and you can just zoom out regularly so the 4 second mark there and I'm going to create yet another key and the same for the rotation a key and a key and I won't go into the difference between keys and curves you can look it up if you want but alright so I'm just gonna make sure that everything is keyframes properly yes that looks fine all right so I'm going to drag the slider into two seconds then I'm going to move it the mace it is a bit to the left and a little bit up a little bit and rotate it a little bit to the left also so if we just go ahead and preview this you can see that it creates creates this smooth looking motion and then it goes back and now I want it to continue on to the other side so I'll just zoom out a little more and just create again keyframes at the position eight and this way I am sure that will always return to the point we came form so add key and key at key and you guessed it at key add key and add key all right so you can also just shift select them all but for now this will do so all right so if we select them all and if hit F we can get a good log on what's going on now slide to six and then move it a little bit to the right rotate it a little bit to the right and move it upwards a little bit and now if we take a look this might be a pretty violent Idol yeah it's a bit too much really but this is the basics of it if we go ahead and select all the keyframes right click on them and say flat this was will smooth out the animations just a bit and if we let me see if we just select all of the keyframes we might be able to if we make a new keyframe at the value of 10 just add the keys and we then select all of these on the top and we hold down shift and we drag on this you can see that we can expand all the others wait this is not working we can okay try to delete this again and the animation system is unit in unit is so barky okay so we could you could go ahead and drag around with these and just make it a little bit longer so the movements won't be so quick and heavy make it a little bit more lights but yes play around with it I'm sure you'll find something you like so down here where it says default you can change this to loop because we wanted to live and you can turn off the recording okay so now we have an idle animation now we just simply want to add this to a script but first of all we need to get this in order so go to project and then drag in the idle where it says attack and this is just the default animation that it'll be playing so when we turn on the play automatically it won't just automatically attack it will automatically play the idol and then we can just if you want and shift up these so this gets to be idle and this gets to be attacked but that's just me it's not necessary okay so now go to the melee double click on the melee system script to open it up in monodevelop and in here you see that we have one line regarding the animation it's called the animation animation top play attack and if we just make a line above that we can go ahead and make these two lines and the dashes and we can just now make a comment so these two mean comments so everything I write here that gets marked with green won't have any effect on the script whatsoever it's just to organize so we can just write attack animation and we can go ahead and make a line onto and write attack function and we can go down here now I'll do the if let me just check here so we can go ahead and make a new line under the if statement under the closing bracket of the if statement and here we can go ahead and type that death the Mase if the maze maze dot animation that is playing is equal to false then we want something to happen so this line is really simple we just say that if the mace is not playing anything then we want something to happen and the thing we want to happen is simply that we want to make sure we are playing an idol because this is our default animation so the maze dot animation don't cross fate and then parenthesis idle and close it up so it's that symbol so if we go into unity now save this off and go into unity and check for errors no errors and then hit play you can see the idle animation playing and looping and when we attack it all go back so this is this is perfect by default so let's go ahead and create yet another animation and this will be our run animation so go into unity and go into the animation panel control six and now select on race and then wets this idle like that and create click create new clip and then name it to sprint and all right so now hit the record button and go to the beginning of the animation there you go and as always keyframe everything with the rotation and the position and I'm gonna do this really quick and go to the two second mark and just make some drastic changes maybe some rotation and then oh okay let's just quickly make sure that we get back first safely and without screwing everything up so create all the keyframes when you want the maze to be back in its default position and then in between we can do all the drastic changes changes so yeah something like that and same going to happen over here again please do this and other applications I'm just showing it off in unity because you can technically be done in unity but it's it's definitely not recommended so um go here and make it bounce up again and make it rotate so now if we select all of the frames have F right click on one of the points she was flat and then hit play and this is not cool for running and this should be faster so we can go ahead and drag these and if you're wondering what the difference between the keyframes in the top and the keyframes down here the keyframes in the top is simply when you select that you select all the keyframes at that current time and this is keyframes for different values so if you hit play yes this is much better I would like some more motion though would like it to go all kinds of crazy like this and maybe be even faster so halftime and the last one and they play yes this is this is cool some weird breaks and stuff you can take a look at those play around with them I won't do all of this now maybe select them and play around if they are smooth thing and stuff make it flat a broken other kinds of weird stuff but I'm sure you can get it to look all right even inside unity so I'm hit this the record button again to stop recording and now we could just simply implement this in our script so stop recording and then go back to my develop and now we are going to type F input dots get key and I'll just quickly explain the different get button get key okay so input dot get button or get button down or get button up is simply you refer to the presets that unity has set up so that could be fine one that could be a preset called jump and you can make presets yourself too and this is basically to ensure that it's not just the spacebar if you're on a PC it's also the B button on a Xbox or the X on a Playstation and stuff like that so it can scale but for now we're just going to type get ki and get ki is one specific key so if get ki and get ki is something that will be called all the time when you have the key down so it will get cold as long as the key is down and on the in the down the pressing down the key itself in pawtucket key down simply just called and that when is Dennis when the key is pressed and the gate key up explains itself it's the same part when you release the key are you so get key and then instead of typing this so typing shift you can't do that you have to type because unity doesn't recognize the key shift so you have to go go inside key code dot left shift and this way this way unity simply knows what key you mean and then close this off with another parenthesis and then curly brackets and some space and now you can go ahead and type the maze dot animation crossfade and the difference between cross crossfade and play when you say that the animation needs to play and you have your character in a certain position it will just jump from that position to the beginning of the position of the other clip immediately so you can get these weird shifts but if you use that crossfade it will simply fade the movement so you won't get that harsh harsh shifting in transform okay so start crossstrait and now you can simply type sprints because we have named the clip sprint and then a semicolon but if we go into a unity hello unity and then press shift running and then stop you can see that the animation plays itself out before it stops and we don't want this so what we are going to do is we are going to make a new statement called F and and here we are going to type input dot get key up and then keycode don't sprint Oh that shift sorry and close this off come on monodevelop is hanging around so and stop messing with me okay so if we get the key up some when we release the instrument then we need the animation to be animation or they may start animation dot cross free idle so we go back to the idle and this way oh I'm in narrow Oh missing parentheses back to unity hopefully in our Irish yes and then equate so we can sprint and stops printing immediately and the position will go back to the default idle this is perfect you will notice though that you can hold down the shift to sprint while standing this is a little weird so we'll be doing some stuff with that later but for now this is the animation system that we'll be using just to get you started with some cool animation so thank you for watching this tutorial and I'll see you next time you
