thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to this Photoshop tutorial today we are going to be taking a look at pixel art so configuring Photoshop to easily create a pixel art configuring a grid all that kind of neat stuff not so much in the drawing technique but more in how to actually make pixel art in Photoshop and we're going to be making a small coin and the reason why I'm suddenly making Photoshop tutorials is because unity the game making tool is soon coming up with some awesome 2d features and so I thought I would prepare you guys on how to create 2d acids for when I'm going to start making tutorials for the 2d games so that's going to be really awesome but this can also be used for many other things great so let's open up Photoshop and first off let's go ahead and make a new document so go to file new or press ctrl n you're going to rename this to coin and go to custom set the width to 20 pixels the height to 20 pixels the resolution is fine at 72 and the rest we are just going to ignore so let hits let's hit OK and zoom a bit in on the white background here and you know whenever you Photoshop makes a background for us it's locked meaning that we cannot edit it so to unlock this layer we can go over here on the right hand side let's this background and double click it and now we get to give it a name let's just call it BG and hit OK so now we can actually edit this layer now let's set up you photoshop so we can make our pixel art first off what we are going to be using are three basic tools the first of which is the pen tool you get this by going over here on the left hand side to where the brush tool is holding down on it and selecting the pencil now it's very important that you use the pencil tool and not the brush tool or we will not get the pixel effect then go up here make sure the size is set to one pixel and the hardness is set to 100 what we also need to do is go on to the eraser when we need to erase things select that and go up here where it says brush and set the mode to pencil instead so this will make sure that we erase with a hard pencil and again set the size of this to 1 and the hardness to 100 so now you can see we get this pixel and the last thing is of course the the Paint Bucket tool which we can just leave as is great so basically what we're going to do now is we are going to set up a grid so we can see what pixels we can paint on so go to view show and make sure that grid is selected but we will also need to change the way the grid is set up because right now it's drawing a grid that is the size of the screen and we want to we wanted to draw a grid with the size of 1 pixel so let's go to edit preferences guides grids and slices and here we can set the grid line to be every pixel and then make sure it's onetoone and now it should be working so if we select our brush tool and start painting you can see that it paints on to each of these pixels so we have an idea of where to paint and of course you can enable and disable this by going to view show grid great so now that we have gotten this far we need to do one more adjustment and that is going to edit preferences general and up here where it says image interpolation we need to change this to nearest neighbor that this means that Photoshop will make sure that when we have hard edges it won't blow them to make them look a higher resolution we want that pixely harsh edge type look so let's select nearest neighbor and finally hit okay and we can start painting so let's just go to the bucket tool I'll select it with the G key change the color in the righthand side to something more neutral like gray just so we have something more neutral to paint on then make a new layer down here in the right hand side create a new layer and select the pencil tool or again press B and the color we are going to be going after is something orange yellowish so a pretty saturated color is something like this and now we can simply start painting away so I'm going to make a square here I'm going to paint onto that whoops like this just keep on painting and we might make an even larger here and then I'm just going to round it off a bit to make it look more like a coin so go like this and like this and let's see if we can get this to look just right and it's starting to shape up and I think this is pretty great so okay so now it's looking like a round shape but to make it look a little more 3dimensional I know you really can't win its pixel art but let's make it look a little more 3dimensional go select a little brighter of a yellow core color not so saturated and let's make just a square of three pixels or four pixels here to give it that glowy kind of look so we we have some light actually shining upon it now I'll actually want to disable the gridlines to see how this looks so go to view show grid and select off and this is looking pretty great already what we can do now is we can double click it on the layer here to bring up all of the layer styles and in here we can add we're very simple effects such as a glow effect which is really great so let's go down here to outer glow and hit the checkmark and select it and first off we have a bunch of settings but here go to the color and let's just use the color picker tool to make it as the same as the coin itself so just press the coin and hit OK and now we can adjust the size of this just to how we want it I think that there looks pretty great somewhere around there there and then bring down the opacity because we don't want it to be that much of an effect or something like 60 and hit OK and we can zoom out and see how our creation looks so far I think it looks pretty great so what we can do now is we can trim we can trim this window so that we won't get all of this gray space so we are going to first off Rini rename this to coin and then we are going to disable the BG layer go to edit no image trim and then select transparent pixels and select okay and now the image has been trimmed to the pixels drawn so we won't get all of this empty space now we can turn back on the BG and see how it looks fairly simple texture but it's going to do fine when we import it into unity so what we can do now is we can again disable the BG layer go to file save as let's just save it on the desktop and as a PNG so select PNG and just hit save and now we have created our first pixel art sprites so we can see it here we can double click it to open it up in Windows Photo Viewer and there we have it so it's ready for importing into a game or using in some concept art whatever you want to do ok so that's pretty much the ending of this video to those of you interested in the new 2d tutorials just hang around for a second because I have some exciting news to share right now on your screen you should be seeing my Twitter account so please write to me at practice tweet if you make something cool in pixel art and want it featured in the game I'm going to be making because if you make something cool you have a chance to be included in the twodimensional asset spec I'm going to make a 2d assets packed with all of the different cool things you can use in your game so other people can download it and use it in their games and also I might use it in the video so please send me stuff and there's a chance you might get featured that way of course you will be credited by by a mention or something so great looking forward to what you guys are going to be creating using this method and thank you for watching I'll see you in the next video
