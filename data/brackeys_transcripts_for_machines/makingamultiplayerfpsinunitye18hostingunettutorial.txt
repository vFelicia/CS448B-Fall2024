thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to this video on making a multiplayer face in unity today we are going to be adding the ability for our players to host their own game so they will be able to go in and create a room using our own custom two UI so that's going to be super fun also if you've somehow been living under your rock I am now on patron that's because I've gone full time with Becky's and I really want to deliver as much content as possible but I am also human being and I have to eat and live and sleep and therefore I need some kind of way of making money through YouTube and ad revenue is really not a lot these days so if you want to support me in making as much content as possible for you guys you can go over to patreon it's a way for you to donate monthly and I offer some rewards in return and I will just show you what it looks like here so this is the patreon page you can go here and you can see some of the goals that I've set up and some of the reward tiers here and you can just click the become a patron button this if this is of course completely optional and you can choose a custom amount if you want or cash in one of the rewards here and you can pay with pretty much anything imaginable so a lot of thanks to the people who have already donated thank you to those of you who will maybe choose to donate after this video and without further ado let's just dig right into it alright so I'm here in unity and what I want to do is transition over to a lobby scene then I want to choose our network manager and add a new component called well host game and this is of course going to be a sea shard sharp script and I just want to separate this out from the network manager just to make things a bit easier to read because we could go ahead and do a custom network manager that had this functionality but I think it's easier to split this up especially because network code can often be a bit more confusing confusing than the usual so first off I want to be using unity engine dot networking so we have access to the function that we need when creating a game on the matchmaking on network so what we want to do here is just delete those functions for now and then we'll create a few variables the first one is going to store the amount of players that can be in our room so this is going to be the private and you would normally make this an integer but unity takes in au int it's just a slightly different data type that is a bit smaller so it takes in a private you end and then we call this room size and let's just default that to 6 you can pretty much go any size you want here as long as it's not ridiculously large of course and then we can have a private string which is going to be the room name and we want to set this using an input field that we create in our GUI you could go ahead and do that at the exact same thing with the room size but I'm just going to set that to a default value so far but again you should expand upon this if you want your game to have or if you want your players to be able to select how big their rooms could be you should definitely just make an input field for this and I'm going to show you the process right now so let's just for now mark this as a serialize field so we can change it in the inspector instead and just have that be constant then of course we need a way for us to change the room name and that is done by letting the input field call some kind of function that will then set the rule name equal to whatever the input field is equal to and we do this by making a public function because we need to access it from without the script or without the host game class and it's going to be a public void and it's going to be called said room name and we take in here a string with the name and this string name if set up correctly will be equal to the current odd text of the input field and so if we set our rule name equal to underscore name well then we will be setting rule name equal to whatever e is on the input field so that's perfect and you could do it the exact same thing with the room size as long as you may remember to pass it into some kind of integer so you need to I'll change the datatype there but we've done that before in other videos and it's just a quick look up if you haven't done that before so next up we can go ahead and make the actual method for creating a room so we are going to do a public void and this is again going to be public because we're going to call it from the button that we're going to be creating on the GUI and this is going to be the create room method and it takes in no arguments and first off we want to just make sure that our room name is valid so we want to say check if roommate room name is not equal to well just nothing and room name is not equal to no so it has actually been instantiated well then we can go ahead and make me make a debug deadlock statement just to let us know that we are creating a room and we can input the room name there and we can say with ah room 4 and then our room size and then players so it's going to say that we are creating some kind of room with a certain name with room for X amount of players so that's perfect and then we can go ahead and actually make a call here level create the room and in order to do this we need a reference to our network manager and this is very easy because on the network manager there is a static variable called the singleton and this this is are currently active network manager but for efficiency's sake we can go up here and we can cash this out so we can make a private network manager and call this one well network manager just with a noncapital n and then in our stat method what we can do is simply set network manager equal to network manager dot singleton and now we've cached that that just makes it a tiny bit more effective and what we can also do in the start method is that we can make sure that our matchmaker is enabled because right now if I just save this we shouldn't have any errors if I just look over this and hit play and of course we have our network manager harder here you can see that we first need to enable the matchmaker and then we are able to create an Internet match of find one and so on and that's what we need to do in code as well so in our start method we are going to just check if it's already enabled then we do that by asking if network manager whoops that was the wrong manager here so network manager dot um and it's match maker is equal to null that means that we haven't enabled it so we need to set in that case we need to do network manager that start match maker and that will just do the exact same thing as we just did through the unity GUI then next up we can create the room now we have a reference we know that our matchmaker is enabled so we can go ahead and create a room down here and we do this by simply saying network manager dot create or dot matchmaker dot create match and this takes in a whole bunch of parameters especially because the one we're going to be using is this one so let's take them one by one so the first one is the red the match name and we just want that to be real name then it's the match size we just want that to be of course room size then our the match advertise we need this to be true so we can discover it then the string match password this is just going to be empty for now however you can definitely go ahead and allow the user to choose a password just as we allow them to choose a name and you could allow them to choose a size so you could of course just input that there but I'm just going to leave this armed so we don't have any passwords and the last one is a callback function that means a function that is that you want to be called when a match is created and in our case we just want to call a function already set up on the network manager for this purpose so if we go in network manager dot on crew on match created is there we go and now we can close this off and this method here will now be called when a match is created we can now save this screen tripped and it should actually be working just fine so if we hit play it's going to be very non exciting but hopefully errorfree so the play and yeah no errors but again nothing happens except that we can see that it has automatically enabled the match so what we need to do now is get a sketch out some kind of you I so if we go on a canvas here we have our image and that's fine and we can maybe go ahead and make me rename this to background and then we can right click go on the UI and maybe choose and ah I'm going to choose here actually let's do an empty object and just reset that and let's rename this to host game and let's ah drag that up here and size it to fit half of our screen and then let's alt or let's make it scale up and down on the center here so that when our screen is moved this way it will scale however it will not scale if we do this that's perfect and then what we can do here is add a vertical layout group and to under this vertical layout group we could add a text object so we're going to do UI text and sometimes when you add it indirectly it helps to just drag it out and drag it back in and then it will snap correctly I don't know why unity tell us that and then we can scale this up because we need it to be quite large maybe something like 32 we can change the color here to just a complete white for now you can of course mess around with this to make it more exciting then we can choose or change the text to our host game and we can maybe make this bold as well then let's Center this on the screen there and there we go and maybe something we could do as well is disable the height stretching and then on the layout group we can go here and select middle centers so all of the different object objects parented to this all of the children will be aligned to the center great so I think that's all we need to do for the text here and we can maybe rename this to host game title or text or whatever you want to do and we can right click on this and create another UI object and this is going to be an input field then we can just do the same thing here drag it out drag it back in and this is going to look very more bad from the beginning but we need to all we need to do is add a layout element component go under preferred height and change this to something larger like 40 or maybe 30 I think 30 is going to suit us fine here just a single line input field and what we can do here is maybe change this to the room name so we know what or maybe room name input actually so we know this is an input field then we can find under this our placeholder text and change this to our room name dot dot so the user know what to knows what to input and everything else on this placeholder looks fine maybe the last thing that we could do and you can of course change the day and layout on this any way you want the last thing that we need to do is go down here to websites on value changed and make sure that we call the method that we created for changing the name on the script so we actually just need to call this function here to make sure that our room name is changed whenever we change something on the input field so they will be synced up so let's go ahead and add a non value changed here and let's take our network manager and drag it in there and let's go down here and select host game and we want that too we want to select the set room name and that's going to be all Ally things so that's perfect and what we can do then is maybe just change the padding a bit here maybe just add 20 and 20 on the sides there so it doesn't scale and fill out the whole entire half of the screen so this is going to be fine and then we can add a button for joining the game so let's go UI button and let's drag again drag this out drag back in let's add a layout element a preferred hide of let's do 50 this time and we can change the text of this button to say join or create room and we can bump up the size to maybe 18 that all looks very fine and I actually don't think we need to edit this any further that's kind of all we need in here then we can rename the button to create room button and we can add down here and on click event and this is what will happen of course when we click the button and we can then drag in our network manager once again and select our network or our host game and select create room perfect so that's all we needed to do there then we can just for just make this look a bit better by on adding some spacing so I'm just going to add a spacing of 10 here just to give it a bit more room on to this ah GUI and the great thing here is when we get ready for that in another video we can simply add another 1/2 over here that says join game and with all of the settings for that so that's going to be very easy or we could simply stretch this over and then simply enable them depending on what we choose so there so there are many possibilities for using this and it's very easy to rescale it because of the vertical layout group so now if we go ahead and try this out so let's hit play and we can maybe type in a room name here and I'm going to type in test room and we are going to hit create room and we're going to wait for unity and now you can see here creating room test room with room for six players matchmaking client create so it makes a great match request and we get a JSON response that says success and then the our room was indeed created so now we are indeed available for other clients to join and for now we can just hit stop here to exit our room and other people will be able to join the room using on the temporary UI we have up here and next up of course we are going to be adding some functionality for joining rooms we're going to have some kind of list that we can go through to select the proper room and a refresh button button and all that so it's not actually that hard but it does take enough time that we need to do that in a separate video so I hope you enjoyed this one I definitely did and I'm looking forward to see you in the next video so thanks for watching and I'll see you soon so I'm going to start mentioning patreon supporters the following month after they donate so that there won't be any difference
