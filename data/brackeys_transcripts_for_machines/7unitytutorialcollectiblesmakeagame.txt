thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to part seven in make a game a cool series on making a video game in unity so basically you should be seeing two things on your screen right now first of which is my Twitter username that's brey's tweet please go ahead and tweet to me if you make something cool using these tutorials so if you've used them in any way please tweet pictures or a download link and there's a chance you might be featured in the next video so I'll start featuring projects and you'll also you're also seeing a preview of what we're going to be making which is pickups or collectible items in this case we're going to be making a coin so we're going to do a little bit of scripting and a bit of visual stuff also so it's half half cool so let's just get started as always I've opened up unity and uh first off let's create the pickups and the visual side of it so let's go to game object create other and select sphere and we should see it appearing here but let's just Center it in our project so we know where it is so 0 0 0 in the transform then move it up here and move it to the side just so we have a good look of what's going on also if if you don't see any Shadows or lighting uh go up and click this sun here in the um top of the scene view uh to get the lighting turned on um because what we're going to be do doing is we're going to be making this look really shiny and that means it will not be affected uh that means that if our light is not that powerful it should still be shining somewhat so we are going to be using lights let's rename this bowl to coin and uh let's first off changed the shape of it just a bit so let's uh scale it down on the xais to something like 0.3 I'll just make it 0.3 exactly so you can follow along and we can all already start seeing it looking more like a coin and uh what we'll do now is we will delete the sphere collider so right click on this and hit remove component and basically what will happen now if we hit this is we go right through it uh and that's not really something we want we want it to disappear as soon as we hit it so we're going to add a new collider we're going to press add component physics and then box collider and you might be thinking well this is not a box but uh the type of collision we're going to be doing here is simply checking whether not our ball has collected the coin and that does not require any more complicated of a shape than the Box um simply because we can't roll in the Z Direction and well yeah there's not much of a difference between the shape of the coin and the shape of the Box uh but yeah it should have adjusted the box for us so it fits else you can go ahead and adjust the center and the size properties one thing we have to remember to do and this is a crucial step is to check the is trigger because if we just go ahead and play now we will collide with with it and that's not something we want we just want to be able to check whether or not our ball has entered the coin and that is done by checking the is trigger so now that we have the is trigger enabled um we can start creating a script but before we do so let's just make this look a little more awesome so go down to the project pane right click hit create and then material so we're going to be making a new material and remember in one of the the last videos I explained what a material are what a texture are and a material is what contains stuff like textures and shaders so it's um you normally have just one material for each object but you can have more uh this one is just going to have a single one and we're going to call this let's say glow glowing and it won't actually be glowing but we'll make it look like it we're going to fake the effect a little bit um and uh what we're going to do is simply just change the melon color to something a little more dark I always do this because when I then drag it onto the coin we can see it changing like this okay but this is not what we want so B basically select the material in the project pane you can also select it under the coin but then you're going to have all the stuff in the way so I don't recommend that just select it in the project Pane and what we're going to be doing first is changing the Shader because no matter how bright we we make this or red or yellow or whatever it doesn't really look that glowing and interesting because this side is really dark and uh what we're going to do to change this is we're going to change the Shader we could change it to something like a specula so we can add a little bit of glow on this side here um and that helps definitely but this side is still way too dark in my opinion so what we're going to do is we're instead going to go down to selfilluminated and then select diffuse selfilluminated means that this um object even though it's in the shade will still have light because it's Illuminating itself and uh you can also have this uh emit light onto other objects but you will have to bake that meaning uh that we have to go through this whole process of making sure this object doesn't move and then making a texture out of it and oing with objects and such it's not something something we want to do for this game for sure because it's so simple so what we're going to do instead is we're going to add a light to it in a moment uh but basically that means that we can leave the illumination map off we can leave the emission uh light MPP as is and uh you can add a texture if you want some texture in there I don't think it's needed uh basically we can just adjust the uh color of this until we get a look just right I want it to be really yellow uh like this and maybe a little more orange like that so we get a little bit of a shaded effect so this side is darker but it's not much and now I think it actually looks pretty fine but as we can see it's not shining onto other the objects so to achieve that this let's add a light and Center it on the coin to do this go to game object create other and then point light let's rename this to coin light drag it onto the coin and then Center the position variables and now you might be thinking why does this Center on the coin and not the center of the scene when its transform is 0 0 0 and that's because whenever we drag an object onto another one we do what is called parenting it so if we take a closer look at what I did to parented up in the hierarchy I selected the coin light and I dragged it onto the coin see that right now the position variables are 2.6 * 1.2 this is because it's 2.6 in the X and 1.2 in the Y so if we go ahead and censer this now it will be in the center of the scene though if we go ahead and drag this on the coin it will be 0 Z and that's because it's now oriented through the coin so if it's 0 0 it will be in the center of the coin that's something uh that confuses a lot of people but it's worth uh noticing cool now that we have this in the center of the coin let's just play a little bit around with its light properties I think it's emitting a pretty beautiful amount of light uh it might be just a bit too much uh but we're definitely going to change the color just a bit and whenever you're changing the color of light watch out it doesn't get too much I think this is too much uh will make it a little more wiish so about half of half the way between wide and completely saturated and then yeah the orange color and we can just bump down the intensity just a bit to something like 0.7 let's try that 0.7 and I think this looks pretty awesome and now when we play the game we can see the light affecting our ball and it's surroundings cool uh what we can also do is add an animation to this coin but I think we're going to do that in a later video since I want to take good time explaining the animated window uh we also going to have a cool particle effect uh whenever the ball picks up the coin but in that is again for another video uh so in this one we're just going to make it disappear cool now let's finally create the script so select the coin not the coin light hit add component new script and let's call this coin actually let's do coin pickup there hit create an ad double click it to open it up in mono develop and we're just going to wait for it to open up there there we go well basically now we have to use a function that will trigger whenever our ball ENT uh our trigger collider so to do this Unity has made a function for us which functions perfectly we this is called ont trigger enter so instead of update we can just get rid of the function start instead of update we're going to type on trigger enter this will be called whenever something enters the trigger on our ball or our coin so basically what we want to do now is we want to check what has entered because if our coin is colliding with the ground this could just be called all the time so instead we want to check if it is actually our ball collecting the coin to do this we have to tell Unity that we want information out of this Collis and we do that by first off naming our information I'll just call it info this is done in the parenthesis uh then we want to specify a type of information and that's going to be of type collider this is just something you have to remember it's not something that I expect you to understand right away since it's a little weird this information gathering and such uh but basically what we're doing is we're saying if something ERS tell tell us more about what has entered and call this information info then we want to check if info. name is actually equal to our ball so if info. name is equal to and then what did we we just called it ball so if info. name is equal to ball and then we can go ahead and open up some bracket keys and let's just go ahead and check if this code works and we can do this by using a debug.log and then open up parenthesis and say uh coin picked up you can type whatever you want here but basically debug. logs are used to check if code is working so if we go under the console window down here and now play the game we should see coin picked up whenever we picked up pick up this coin so if we roll in here you can see it says coin picked up that's just what we want but right now we're checking for a name we could also be even more con convenient and check for a tag if our let's say our game has multiple players who should all be able to pick up this coin it's better to use tag so we'll use info. tag and then it needs to be able to uh check for player save this and hit into Unity this is not going to work right away we can just check this by clearing the error here or pressing clear and play and then playing so if we play once more here nothing happens when we enter the coin that's because we actually have to tag our ball you do this by selecting it and going to the inspector where says tag here we can just select the player if you want another tag hit add tag and add it to the list then go under the ball and assign it I'm just going to go with player since the ball is actually our player now we can see that this is all looking right and we have tagged our player so let's select the console window and have a go at it and see if it works it does great so so now we don't really just want the console to say coin picked up we want something to actually happen first off we want the game object uh to be destroyed so destroy and then in the parenthesis here type game object with a small G that's important so uh whenever we do this destroy the destroy function is obviously used to destroy things but game object when we just type it like this means that it's the uh object the script is sitting on that will be destroyed so that means our coin if we go ahead and test this oops try again hit play and uh roll into our coin H okay I'm back Unity was having some problems but uh it's gone now I restarted it so let's hit play and uh now we can simply roll into our coin and the coin disappears and also the coin lights because it's it's parented to the coin so that disappears with it great uh but uh that that's basically it for the simple part of the script we could also add a coun that gets bigger and bigger whenever we pick up a coin so we can keep track of how many coins we have picked up we'll go ahead and do this in a later video in a separate script uh but basically to remember um to make us remember that we need to do this right before we destroy the game object let's put in the debug.log saying that uh we should add some functionality here let's just say add coin counter here this is great if you multiple people working on a project or just for remembering things you need to add so now when we hit play the coin disappears and it says add coin counter here that's basically it for this video guys I hope you enjoyed it and I really look forward to seeing what you have made using the tutorials again the um if if you want to tweet to me do it at brais tweet again brais tweet thank you for watching the video and I'll see you in the next one
