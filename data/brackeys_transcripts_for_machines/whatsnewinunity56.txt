serious what's new engine ad 5.6 the beta start already and the full version will be released to 31st this month a lot of exciting stuff so let's get into it so the first improvements are three features that will definitely speed up the lighting workflow the light Explorer is a brand new window that gives an overview of all the lights in the scene you know how light can either be baked into a light map or updated in real time well now you know this reintroducing mix mode and mix between faked and realtime lighting for static objects the light is baked into the light map but dynamic objects to cast realtime shadows progressive light mapper energy now quickly breaks a low resolution light map for the part of the scene you're looking at this allows you to see changes almost immediately and then the light map increases in quality until it's fully baked this feature is not part of the beta but will be out with the full release flex 5 pence extra set out to improve AI pathfinding with a rework navmesh system from now on you can have multiple math measures in the scene and orient them in any given direction in addition the path can now be updated in real time which is great for dynamic terrain or procedurally generated levels of course 5.6 also comes with a bunch of graphical improvements such as GPU instancing and metal compute shaders along with a performance increase for the particle system oh and unity finally got support from Vulcan looking at the graphics API that is really efficient at taking advantage of multiple CPU cores which means that it can free up processing power on some platforms Vulcans will run on Android Windows Linux and Titan the video player has been rebuilt from scratch to play 4k videos which is great for 360 VR a debug view for physics geometry has been added features that improve 2d game making include access distance sort which helps solves the access sorting problems by enabling you to set the transparency sort mode to a custom access you can use the sort include component to render a set of objects separately from others on the same sorting layer 2d physics improvements where the biggest one for me is probably the composite Collider 2d which allows you to merge different types of kaleidos into one in real time and to the duty artists rejoice we now have nine slice if you don't know nine slice is a technique for stretching or repeating defined areas of the sprite this means that we can create very small textures that can be easily manipulated and resize the graceful platform other than that the beta now includes Google daydream and cardboard VR support you also be able to deploy your projects to the new Facebook game room desktop app for Windows or to facebook.com using your movies WebGL support unity collaborate is unities relatively new cloud base that allows small teams to sing and share project it's basically just unity sound version control system and so far it's been lacking but they are now introducing partial publish and the ability to roll back changes it probably won't get me to leave gate just yet but we're getting closer finally and this is something that I'm super excited about unity is working on implementing the public editor extension text mesh pro into unity as an avid txt much pro user it's great to see unity accepting that their text editing tools are really support also text most Pro is now free on the App Store that's pretty much it for version 526 along with a bunch of smaller changes and bug fixes of course however unity has also teased two new features that will be coming sometime in 2017 the first one is timeline its cinematic sequence it's all timeline allows you to easily create interactive cutscenes or scripted events with access to some really nice camera tools so far timeline looks really interesting and well done the second feature is something that has only been discussed pretty vaguely it's a fully multithreaded job system enabling better use of multicore CPUs a lot of unanswered questions on this one I'm excited to see where unity will take it it could definitely lead to some really nice performance improvements if you want to read more about 5.6 timeline or anything else i've talked about in this video I will have links in the description this video is of course a bit different from the usual tutorial so please let me know if you like it and want to see more thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks of the awesome people who donated in February and a special thanks to Derek huge jerk face bone marrow 5 James Callaghan and Jason Latino if you want to become a picture in yourself you can do so a pitching becomes less Preki thanks a lot guys
