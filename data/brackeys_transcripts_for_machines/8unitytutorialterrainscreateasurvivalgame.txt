hello everyone and welcome to the eighth tutorial in our survival game series done by brackets I am the CEO of brackets and today we are going to take a look at creating terrains and applying textures so generally we'll make it look a lot better much more exciting and stuff so let's get started by opening up unity I've already done this as usual and the project is exactly as we left it so yeah let's go ahead first of all we could create a terrain so to do this let's get rid of our ground plane maybe not deleted just selected and disable it using this little checkbox right here so now we doesn't we do not have anything to stand on so let's fix this by going to terrain create terrain so basically once you create a terrain it is gigantic it's absolutely huge probably four nine 99.9% of all games this is too big so let's go ahead and adjust it to make it smaller um I love feasible people don't know how to do this correctly so let's just rightclick and name this mmm you know what let's just keep it at terrain for now and we can rename it to maybe grass Hills later or something more specific okay so for now we can go up onto the terrain tab once one more time and now hit the set resolution so this is basically the length and width and height in units detering is going to be and when I say height I mean maximum height so when once we start sculpting some of the mountains that's just the limit of how high we can get with the terrain by default this plane right here is at zero unit so it's from zero to by default 600 but we are going to change this so we could start out by trying something like pretty big still 500 by 300 by 500 one thing that is very important is that you do not change the relationship between between width and length they need to be exactly the same let me show you why so if we go ahead and set the resolution and hit F so we can see the whole plane you can see that this down here is all light so it's still gigantic maybe we should scale it down a little more but if I just turn off the lighting in the scene by hitting this little light we can get a better look and once I use my go to the right hand that's like the sculpting or painting tool you can see that this has a fine blue little mark on the plane and once we start I'll just use the sculpt to demonstrate you start sculpting it looks fine but if I go ahead and change the resolution to let's say 500 100 even though you might want to do this you can see that the brush itself also get scaled so if you want something to just happen along this kind maybe you're doing a side scroll and want everything to be seen from the side so you don't want that much depth just make the terrain just set the resolution to the same I think we'll go with 400 by 400 instead but set the width and length to the same and then just focus on detail here and that the rest be okay so we have our huge plane let's make sure that this is somewhat centered in the scene because by default in unity our terrain has a is anchored at the lower corner so let's go ahead and drag this green box and this can just be done by eye or we could type in half of 200 some oh sorry my half of 400 some 200 and 200 but it won't matter all right so if we zoom in a little I think the first thing that we kind of need to do is to create a one big tileable texture a texture and we can then later on paint details so on this will just give us some sort of reference it'll make everything easier to see so first off all let's go to navigate to our browser and sorry I was just on YouTube navigate to a browser go to google and search for anything this could be free ground seamless texture and seamless means means that it can be tiled without creating these ugly kind of edges so pick anything you want I'm going to go with some kind of grass this looks alright I'm not too convinced though generally you don't want something with terrible textures you don't want one big line through all they need it needs to be like just blade with all the detail because else you can see it tiling and you don't want the texture to be too big either so on for now I'll just go with this I think now that's pretty bad I'm okay so I'll go with this one this one looks great there are some marks that we can probably see when once it's good it gets child but let's save it out as grass texture so one and just simply drag it into unity and now we select our terrain and go under the paint tap the little brush hit the Edit textures and hit add texture and you can just drag the grass under the texture and I'll guess that the size needs to be ten by ten so this is basically how big each tile is going to be and let's hit the Add button and you can see that from a distance it looks horrible but once we go in and play it looks much better it does not contain that much detail though this looks something that could be played on a web browser so let's go back and maybe um change the size down to something like five times five remember that each time you scale the number down more tiles need to be created though this is not the most important the most important is that once you see it from a distance you can see the pattern start appearing so it's really about finding the right balance this is well it's alright we'll go with it for now so once we have this let's create a better light to light up everything because now every object is not white so it's easy to see how we should light it so let's go to game object and create audio and select the directional light and this might be it's a bit too much though so we can change the intensity down to 0.3 and we can go ahead and select it in our scene may be stirring out the transform if you want I'll just drag it off a bit remember the thing about directional lights is that it won't two Reds placed in the scene it's just it just will matter though how it is rotated so it's just light emitting from one source so this is basically the Sun emitting from up there and so I'll place the light something like this so if we go ahead and play you shouldn't have too many arkla shadows and this looks much better um kind of looks like gmat actually that's a good thing and yeah so let's hit the stop playing button and disable the light once again in the scene I just like working this way select the terrain and go under the first tab on the right hand side this is the sculpting and and this is basically for creating mountains if you want a mountain that stops at a specific height you can use the next tab where you can then adjust how high and then create these kind of mountains or Hills or whatever you want to call them so um okay let's go back under the sculpting and let's maybe create a kind of a bounding box some kind of the restrictions of the level by creating some some mountains and notice when I start scaling up and look from the side this part of the terrain doesn't get drawn this reduces the amount of vertices that needs to be drawn by the graphics card but you also have to be aware that you don't get these ugly glitches so on something like this again please go into more detail line than I do I'm just trying to show you some of the techniques maybe change the brush size up a little bit so we can get some bigger mountains make it very doesn't need to be this squarey we can make some mountains then go out and different sites maybe we could have kind of a see like area here a little pool and so just creating the bounding box something like this and this will do maybe even some more detail some mountains there this is what it looks like now in game this is not too bad actually so once you have painted some of these details what shot for doing too much detail the places where the character is running it can be annoying that he bounces up and down all the time because of of these little the bumps so please don't do that only do that the places he isn't at so maybe at the mountains you want to select a different kind of brush something with a lot of detail and maybe scale the brush size down a bit and you can get these coollooking mountains so if I just do this on a part of the mountain and go ahead and hit play you can see that the mountains look a lot more organic now but go ahead and play around with this I'll just make a quick some quick detail around the edge well this might be too much this is of course hard on the computer than just the ordinary smooth mountains but it does really look cool so why not okay so let's previous wow this is cool okay so um this is what I'll go with for now what you can then do is you can go under the terrain settings under the last tab and you can turn up stuff like the pixel array so this will in game effect how many errors the terrain allows for us on longer distances so you can see once I get closer the terrain start to fix itself itself up you generally want to leave this between 5 and 15 anything about that just gets mad so totally squid squished so I'll leave this at 9 and the shadow distance won't matter I wanted to cast shadows and the rest we'll play with later one thing that can affect how heavy the terrain is on your computer is if you go under set resolution then the base texture resolution will do quite a bit so play around with that also remember to only use so only use numbers that can be divided by two so this would be 512 Oh 128 64 32 numbers in in that order please do that at 250 no 265 no 56 and and so on so forth so okay let's let's go ahead and continue so let's paint on some detail so if we again select the terrain and the terrain script I had not collapsed and then go ahead and hit the paint tab we can add a new texture so let's go go online and find a new texture so something free stone texture seamless or tile you can probably type in both and while that's a that's really nice that one and let's see how it looks in game so save that out and drag it to unity and we'll rename this to stone texture so one and we'll go back to our terrain edit textures and texture dragon that stone texture select probably ten to five remember things that are in the distance as mountains generally they are don't bother giving them too much detail so now you can see that we have yet another texture that we can select so we can select this and then just start painting over the mountains witness so watch out for the smoothly transitions generally want this to be pretty harsh Elsa can look really weird but play around with this again I'm just demonstrating how to use the different tools oh I made a mistake there so something like this I think that's all right so we go ahead and play it back you can see that it actually starts looking like something that could be in real life except back maybe so let's go ahead and fix this to the side here oh so I had make sure that you select the stone texture paint out some detail if you just want small layers of stone not the very harsh ones you can go ahead and bring down the opacity and this is basically how much you can see through the texture also you could do stuff like this to create even more detail I want Bobby so this looks pretty good yeah it looks fine so you could go ahead and import some more grass textures some more ground textures to vary it up and maybe even well I guess we'll take it a look at creating some trees and some some moving grass and stuff like this in another tutorial but for now this is how our world is going to look I am afraid that I did not cover the material and texture apply meant to objects we'll do this in a nonde tutorial as well and weapon switching it's on its way also the enemy scripting that will also come out I have no idea I can get time enough to do all this but guys i brakus site is up brakus con you can go ahead and download everything and very soon a downloadable RAR file i think it's going to be available with all the scripts that I type out and the assets that I create so you don't have to go ahead and model the amounts and for now they're free I have added a donate button so if you like what we do and think that you want to just give something back you are you can decide exactly how much it needs to be it'll just go for this for sound sound some stuff video making tools unity plugins that I could cover and maybe even doing some things in unity Pro if I can get my hands on that much buy them you really don't have to it's just if you want to but for now thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
