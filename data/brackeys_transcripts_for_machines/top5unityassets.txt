one of the most common questions that I get asked is what assets I use when I make games and for good reason picking up a good editor extension or model pack can save you countless hours of development time so I hopped on Twitter and asked you guys if you wanted to see a video on the assets that I use the most and the response was overwhelming so here they are my favorite unity assets first off we have pro builder pro builder is an awesome tool for building and editing geometry inside of unity in my opinion it's actually the best prototyping tools you've ever hit the stored just because you can so easily sketch out a level Pro Bowler comes in two versions basic which is free and advanced the free version has all the basic mesh editing tools but without a lot of the stuff that you expect to see in a dedicated modeling software so if you want stuff like editing movies mesh mirroring and export to obj you will have to upgrade fun fact one of the games that I'm looking forward to the most at the moment manifold garden is actually built entirely using pro builder next it's a free asset by unity that has for some reason gone under the radar a little bit I'm talking about the unity particle pack this pack is filled with explosions fire lightning rain and all kinds of cool effects it's really nice to see a particle effects pack of this quality and I've already used it in a bunch of projects now it's time for the only paid asset on the list Odin Odin basically just makes sure inspector much more powerful with Odin you can serialize anything from dictionaries to delicates and it has to be 50 attributes for adding stuff like buttons color palettes and tabs if your program is looking to improve your workflow I really recommend picking up Odin as our fourth asset we have another editor extension text mesh Pro Tex much pro is a complete revamp of anything text in unity it makes your text render nicer it's super performant and it has a lot of layout and styling controls I actually have a video on setting up and using text much bro spoiler alert it's really easy Tex Mex pro was recently acquired by unity and is now free of charge so that's pretty awesome and the final asset on the list rock and boulders now this pack rocks if you ever designed an outdoor scene you know that something you pretty much always need is rocks and I have never seen as nicelooking rocks as these of course this acid is also free that's pretty much my list of favorite assets I've created a list on the asset store with all of them and a few others that I couldn't squeeze into the video on the link for that in the description now really try to keep this video short but I have so many more assets that I want to share with you if you want to see more videos on the subject definitely let me know in the comments we could maybe do assets in a particular category next time so if you have a category that you would like to see definitely let me know as well find that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in Arcis and especially thanks to hence often Derek Ames Kirk Faison Merrifield yes pamekasan James P psychic mommy Jason Lotito Erin Robert Bund Husam Casa and Judah Minh if you want to become a picture in yourself you can do so at patreon.com slash practice thanks a lot guys
