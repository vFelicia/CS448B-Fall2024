hello everyone welcome to this video on creating a rope cut the rope replica this is a livestream tutorial hence the failures are going to be during the way and the game that we're going to be making looks something like on this if I go ahead and hit play here you can see that we have these different anger points and from each anger points to the weight in the center we have ropes and we can go ahead and cut these and you can see the physics changing in order to adapt to that and we can use this to create different levels with different puzzles so if you've never played cut the rope before the idea is to arm control this weight around the screen in order to pick up coins and eventually land in the frogs mouth to feed him and that can be done of course by manipulating these ropes so that's what we'll be making today we'll be focusing only on the rope and rope cutting part because I find that the hardest part and most essential to the game and the way that I have it set up here is we have on each rope a rope GNU radio script that where we can control the amount of links that we want and we have a hook or a link prefab we have a reference to the weight and the hook and then once we play it goes in and generate all of the parts that make up our chain and each one of these are using hinge joints in order to be connected to the previous one in the chain so that's kind of the setup that we have here and I don't think that we need to talk anymore about it let's just go ahead and create a new project and get on with it and also if you want to download everything for yourself there will be a link in the description once this airs on YouTube that points to a github where the entire project is there sprites scripts everything so you can always check that out if if you miss something so let's go file new projects and let's call this cut the rope rip the camp and let's change this to a 2d project they create project that I'm going to have a sip of water while it's loading out and I'm going to be using five point six point O the newest version currently is five point six point one shouldn't make a difference whatsoever so now we in here a new empty project let me begin by just saving my scene as let's just call it main just because I save all the time and it's going to pop up by either way and it's also bringing a few sprites here so I have my sprites as Photoshop files in this folder I have a background a hook a link and a weight and if we go ahead and drag all of these inside of unity we can see what they look like so here they are and let's begin by just taking our background into our scene let's also scale this up a bit let's do one point one on the X&Y just so that when we maximize our game we can we can see the entire background without it cutting off cool so that's our background and let's just go ahead and create a sorting layer for this it's called that storing their background move it to the top and let's now make sure that it uses that sorting layer just to make sure that every sprite that we're going to be creating is on top of that background cool and yes just want to check the viewer count there everything's looking good so now let's go ahead and bring in a hook so let's take our hook hook sprite here and this is going to be on the place from where or on chain is going to be anchored and the first thing that we want to create on our hook here or place is a few components we want first of all a sprite renderer we already have that we then want a rigidbody 2d and we're going to set this to kinematic because we don't want our hook to ever change position during our game it's just going to be stationary at the point of creation so that's all good then what we can do is maybe rename this to rope instead then under the rope let's go ahead and add a link sprite so we can see our link here now let's go ahead and reset the transform on that and we can then maybe move it down here so we can have a good look at it and here we want to go ahead and add a few components so the first component we want to add is a rigidbody 2d and this one is not going to be kinematic this one is going to be dynamic because we wanted to move according to on the physics system while the game is running and right now if we hit play it's just going to fall down because gravity is being applied the next thing I want to do shoes maybe up the mass of this object a tiny bit let's put it at around five that's what my testing found to be pretty good and let's also add some linear drag if you don't know then your drag is basically air resistance so it just means that it's going to slow down at some point if unless other forces are applied we also want to amp above the angular drag to say point one I found that to be a pretty good value so now what we can do is go and add a new component and the component we want to add now is the hinge joint 2d oh and this is what we'll be using for each part of our chain and this the cool thing about the hinge joint 2d is that it pretty much does everything we need for us so what we do here is basically connect a rigidbody and this is going to be the rigidbody of the previous part of the chain so in our case that would be the hook itself and so we would go ahead and connect the hook itself there but for the other links if we have more links in our chain here it's going to be the rigidbody right before it so we simply need to change these together by connecting the rigid bodies and then we also need to make sure that our anchors are correctly configured and to do that we want to check off autoconfigure connected anger and instead going through and define one bar set up so make sure that whoops we don't want to use motor make sure that everything is 0 0 0 and then undo connected anger under the Y we want to go ahead and set that to minus 0.3 so negative 0.3 is a good starting point for the distance between your between your links in the chain and that's what we specify here it's the distance between each link and I'm going to show you what it looks like if you adjust this later but first we have to kind of get our chain generated in order to actually see what these things are doing so I'm just going to view a few steps here setting up some settings and then we can play around with them later so that is what we want I'll link to do and we can take this link now and turn it into a prefab so let's just drag it down to the project panel here and let's now remove it from our theme what we also want to do is go ahead and actually have a link that works in pretty much the same way but isn't a prefab so actually I just changed my mind let's go ahead and remove the prefab here and let's have let's duplicate this and the first one here we're going to call the hook and the second one here we're going to call the link and now we can take the link and drag down here to make it in to a prefab mental leave it and the reason for this is that we actually need a link element at the very beginning of our chain that is going to sit on top of our anger and it's going to behave in a tiny bit different way than all of the other links the reason for this is that I found when creating a chain the first element in India in the chain was acting weird until I found out that if you place an element of the chain on top of the anger point the chain suddenly had a more realistic field so that's what we're doing here we have the anchor and we have the first part of a chain called the hook at the very start or at least on top of each other and so now what we can do is take this hook here and we can connect the rope meaning the anchor point to the connected rigidbody so I'm dragging in the rope there and now when we play nothing which should happen okay so it's just there it's just stationary but really what's going on here is that our hook is connected to that anger point and what I also want to do is simply remove the sprite renderer at least disable it because we don't want this to be drawn so we now have an anchor a hook and a link prefab now all we need to do is go inside of our arm or create a component on a rope here a script that will generate all of the necessary links and add them up and hook them together so let's go in here and create a rope component it's going to be a csharp script let's say create an and let's double click this to open it up in visual studio and meanwhile I'm just going to have a look in the chat to see if everything is going I good yes everything's good it's awesome and yeah so inside a visual studio now we don't need any of the system data collection stuff so let's remove those will also be removing at least our update method we will be using start and at the top here let's go ahead and create a few variables the first one is a reference to our hook because we need on this the second element in our chain to be connected to the hook a third element in the chain will be connected to the second element and so on so we need a reference to the hook let's go in here and create a public and we don't need this to be of type game object instead we can make it of type hinge joint 2d and we'll call that hook we'll also create a public game object and this is going to be the link prefab so each link in our chain will be spawned using this prefab so let's call it link prefab and finally we'll have a public integer which is going to be the amount of links in our chain so let's just call this links and set it equal to I don't know seven by default then inside of our start method we can go ahead and call another method double begin creating in a sec called something like generate rope and let's make that now void generate rope and the first thing that we want to do here is loop through all of our links so for each link we want to go ahead and create one using our instantiate so let's write for int I equals 0 and we want to keep going as long as I is less is less than links and each time we go through we want to add one on to I so we want to increment by one so for these seven links we want to go ahead and generate a part of the rope to do that we'll call instantiate and the prefab that we want to instantiate is the link free fat and we want to parent it to our current rope object so as the parent will simply insert transform meaning our ropes transform cool so now we should see that when we hit play oh of course we need to reference this so let's drag in our hook here and let's drag in our link prefab and now when we hit play we should see that voila it spawns seven links however they are currently just sitting at the center of our scene and they aren't really configured in any way actually the hinge joint is on trying to get them as close to the center of our scene as possible and that's because we haven't connected any rigid bodies so in order to do that we first off need a reference to the link prefab that we just spawned to do that let's create a game object here let's call it our link and set it equal equal to our instantiated prefab we can then our get components on the link more specifically we want to get the hinge joint 2d on that link let's just call this joint by going link get component and the component that we want to get here is hinge joint to be called so now we have a reference to the hinge joint 2d on the generated link however we need to also of course go joint dot and then it's called connected rigid connected body there we go so we need to set the rigidbody they connect the rigid body of that joint equal to the previous rigid body in our chain now the first time we run through this that's going to be the hook the second time it's going to be the second element the third time it's going to be the third element and so on so we really need to go in here create a rigidbody 2d and let's just call this the previous RB and we're going to default this to be the hook ah wait okay so we need the hooks let's change this to game object and let's do dot getcomponent here because we need the rigid body of our hook here alright that's better and actually I think it's even cleaner if we just make our hook a rigidbody2d I think we can go ahead and do that so we don't need to use any getcomponent so the first time we run through previous rigid bodies is going to be equal to our hook and so when we set the connected body off by joint we set it equal to the hook directly then after that we can set previous rigid body equal to the rigid body of the joint that we're currently looking at so we'll go link get component of type rigidbody 2d and so each time we go through it's going to set the previous rigidbody equal to the connected rigidbody the connected rigidbody equal to the previous rigidbody and it's then going to update the previous rigidbody so this is going to run seven times and set up seven connection links let's try and see if that works and let's just make sure that we don't need to update anything here yeah okay so we need to drag in the hook again because we changed the type so now when we hit play voila yes things are indeed working however are connected anger is down here for some reason not working but you can see that we now have links where nope nope not working not working at all so what did we do wrong here previous rigid body equals link does get component with your body while am I missing guys equal to th should be equal to hook here should be a good to the link or the rigid body of the current link I believe that's fine am I missing something hmm so the first time our rigid body should it be equal to the hook because we want the first rid your body or the first link in our chain to be connected to the hook the next link should be connected to arm the first link and so the first time it's going to run through it's going to set joint are connected oh there we go yeah alright this should be previous with your body there we go thank you and yes the chat is now calling me stupid thanks guys so of course we did not want this to be equal to hook every time instead we want this to be equal to the previous rigid body in the chain cool so now we can go and hit play and hopefully this time there we go so the first one here is connected to the rope the second one is connected to the hook and now each link element in the chain is connected to the previous one so this one is connected to that one this one is connected to that one and it keeps going that's super cool because what we can now do if we just go ahead and select all of these links here we can go into our connected anger and set that equal to minus 0.3 on the Y and voila we have a chain cool so let's just do that inside of our link on a prefab here we can simply go and set the connected anchor to negative point 3 on the Y and now when we play by default it's just going to work so that's awesome and we can actually go in here and manipulate these elements if I take the last link in the chain here and move that around you can see the chain updating in real time and they might have some weird behavior and yes that is to be expected considering just how easy easily we set this up but it is working and especially when we add something heavy towards the end of the chain here this is going to look fairly realistic also if you don't want this to be kind of comprised of a bunch of individual links what you could do is use a line renderer to draw lines between each of these points that would actually make that look quite a bit more like rope but I'm going for the clear minimalistic style here so yeah this is what would you all right so thanks for helping me debug that so I think it's time for a sip of water just so I don't get too dried out in the throat and let me see if everything is working other than people really spamming a lot about my stupidity before everything is looking good so the next thing that we want to do is connect our weight at the end of the chain and if we have multiple chains well then we want to connect multiple boy then we want to connect all of them to the same weight to do that we first off have to go ahead and add the weight so let's drag in the weights right here and what I'm going to do is simply add a component this is going to be a rigidbody2d and this is going to be dynamic because we wanted to be simulated in our physics space we also want a mass of say 8 they learn your drag of say 0.1 and an angular drag of say point 1 as well now when we hit play we should see that that just Falls right away now what we could do if we try and hit play now is we could add a hinge joint to our weight here I pause the game just to be able to do this we could then connect the last part of a link to that hinge drawing and we can set the connected anchor anchor by disabling Auto configure here to the same negative 0.3 on the Y and now you should see the Walla or chain is connected to our weight so that is actually all we need to do through script is at runtime add a hinge joint for each rope that we find and connect the last part of that rope so to do that let's go ahead and create a script that sits on the weight and let's just call it the weight script and let's double click that to open it up in visual studio and in here let's create a method that does exactly that so let's go ahead and delete the two using tags at the top delete our to default methods let's create a public we want this to be public because we actually want our ropes to access our weight in order to do this and we could make it a public void called say on set or maybe connect rope end there we go and we of course want to pass something in here and the thing that we want to pass in is a rigidbody2d that is going to be the end rigidbody so let's just call it in our B so this is of course the rigidbody component of the last part of our chain so that would be this one so what we can now do is using this in rigidbody we could go ahead and call add component on the game object in order to add a hinge joint 2d and yes we do want a hinge joint for each rope in our scenes or if we have four ropes we want four hinge joints that are affecting the weight in each their direction with each their force so um each time we call this we want to add a hinge joint and we can store this in a variable so it's of course going to be of type hinge joint 2d we can call it joint and set it equal to our new component we can then access our joint and what we want to of course change here is the connected body we want to set that equal to the end of our chain which we will make sure to pass in here as an argument and we can also set up some other properties here so we want to go join anchor and we want to set this to vector 2.0 so we want that to be zero zero on both the X axes remember that our hinge joint here on our weight should be zero zero on the anchor zero on the X connected angry and then minus 0.3 on the Y connected Angra actually we could maybe give it a bit more room on our weight in particular because it's a bit bigger than the rest of the links but we'll have a look at that in a second so now we can go join dot and then it's connected anchor and this we can set equal to a new vector to where the first part our xaxis is zero and the second point our yaxis is our going to say be negative 0.3 or we could make this a big a bit bigger we could also make it into a variable that we can easily configure let's do that so let's make a public float here and this is going to be our on say distance from chain or distance from chain and something like that I like to be very specific in my naming of these variables even though they might have ridiculously long names that I'm never going to get forget what what does so that's the best part and let's say that equal to actually let's just try something like point six of course negative point six but if we just say point stakes here then we can put negative distance from chain and there I think that's cleaner when we now save this and then go into the rope we of course need to call it and we only need to call this on the very last link and so what we do is we check if I live our value that what the index of the element that we're currently looking at is less than links it means that or links minus one actually so if the element we're currently looking at the index of the element we're currently looking at which is first going to be 0 then 1 then 2 all the way up to 6 is less than links minus 1 so it's going to be true for all links except the last one because 0 or 0 is less than 6 1 is less than 6 2 is less than 6 except for 6 and so the very last element here whoops the very last element here arm is going to not meet this requirement and so it's going to call the else statement instead so for all of these links until the last one we are going to set our previous rigid body equal to the current rigid body and for the last one only we'll go ahead and say arm find our weight we could either do that using find object of type or we could go in here and actually create a reference with which I think we're going to do is let's create a public weight and let's call this one weight and then down here we simply go weight dot arm connect rope end and we pass it in our link getcomponent rigidbody2d so whoops rigidbody2d so the rigid body of the link that we just set up boom all right so now that when now when we generate our rope we're going to go through generate all the link parts for the standard ones we're just going to set them up by connecting them to each other and then for the last one we're going to call connect rope end on the weight and we're going to pass in the rigid body then on the weight we'll go ahead and link that rigid body as the connected body on a weights joint instead of all of our settings there so now when we hit play or at least when we go into unity and select our rope drag in our weight and then hit play we should see okay so that's quite a bit of distance it's kind of unexpected amount of distance try point three on that see what that looks like I don't know what's giving us rich this much trouble oh I know why so under our joint we of course also need to make sure to set our anchors and what is it anchor autoconfigure connected anchor to false we does we did that manually on all the other components here we need to do it through script so just make sure to say that defaults or unity is going to try and calculate some stuff for you and we don't want it to do that let's now set our distance from chain and back to 0.6 and hit play and yay our chain is working and now it's actually really really easy to just go in here and add more ropes with simply duplicate our rope we move it over and we bump or we increase or lower the amount of links so this is a bit further away so let's give it more links let's try 12 for that one and it's going to be more than climbing and there you go and so now we can actually start having a look at cutting these ropes and let me show you how easy this is in fact all we need to do is go in select a certain part of the rope let's say this one and in order to cut the rope we simply delete it there we go and now we have rope swinging and it's cutting and everything is great hallelujah I just I love this effect so much because something about ropes feel really math intensive and they can be can be but unity just makes it so easy with hinge joints and it's just also fun because it feels so organic you never really know how a rope is going to act at least not these ones because they're weird so on yeah and the chest success as well that's good cool so now let's go ahead and cut up our chains to do that we need to register whether or not we hit them with our mouse to do that we'll need a Collider on the link so that we can cast out a raise to find out if we hit the collider let's go and find each part of our link here which is generated from this prefab and here we can go ahead and create a new circle Collider 2d and for the circle Collider let's just move this into the scene so we can see what's going on I want to increase the radius a little bit make it a tiny bit bigger than it needs to be I think that's good and let's not now hit or mark it as a trigger and then hit apply now we can remove this from our scene and we should now see that when you hit play and go into a scene here and select all of our links they all have our colliders so that's perfect what we can then do is go and create a new script let's set this on a separate object an empty object reset the transform in that and let's call this empty object something like hmm rope cutter I wanted to call it knife but I thought I might get flagged on you choose something for doing that let's move this to the top and let's add a component called rope cutter again csharp create net all that jazz let's double click it to open it up in visual studio and now on this one let's go ahead and delete the two using text as always let's delete these dark method we don't need that but we actually need the update for this one and what we want to do inside of our update is check if input get Mouse down don't get mouse button and the button that we want to check for is 0 meanness meaning left mouse button so 0 is left mouse button 1 is middle Mouse and 2 is right click or is it 1 right click mailmouse I shouldn't be teaching that if I don't even remember myself let's check the docs so umm 0 is definitely leftclick so if we click the left mouse button but then we want to go ahead and fire out a rave to check whether or not we hit a part of the chain where we're currently clicking to do that we first off need to get a ray cast hit 2d and let's just call this hit and it's going to store all the information about our ray and we'll set this equal to physics 2d got ray cast and we want to cast out a ray using camera main dot and this is going to be screen to world point and we want to get the world point of our mouse position so we'll go in put that mouse position and we then want to say comma vector 2.0 yes so basically what we're doing here is we are spawning a ray at the point of our mouse position so at on the z axis that's going to be 0 and then it's going to be wherever we click with our mouse and we don't actually want this raid to go anywhere and that's why we write vector to that 0 here we simply use the Ray kind of SA point is there anything that collides with the rate at this given point because we don't need to do any shooting with longer Ray's we just need to check at the point of impact so that's why we write it this way and we can then go ahead and check if hit dot Collider it's not equal to null so we if we've actually hit something well then we can check if hit dot tag whoops hit Collider tag it's equal to let's call it link we'll go ahead and create that tag in a second well then we've hit a certain part of a chain we've hit a link and we can go in here and destroy our hitch Collider game object you can destroy that link and that's going to cut up a room and that's all we need to do that's everything so now we can go inside of unity and we can find our link and we can go in here and add a tag the tag that we want to add here is linked and then for our link we can make sure to assign that tag you could go ahead and assign it to the hook as well if you want to be able to cut ropes at the very top here where the anchor is but I don't think that's needed I think it's better if we can only cut a rope along on the places that we can actually see it what I also want to do is make sure that this hook is always the need okay so it it's not too important for the hook here actually because it doesn't have a spare in it right but I want to make sure that our links it's always drawn underneath everything else let's go in here and change the audio layer to negative one let's also make sure that our weight is always drawn on top so let's change the order in layer two plus one cool so now when we hit play and if we go and try and click one of these links yes we have slicing so now we can cut the ropes any way that we want to and if you find that sometimes is misses when you try and cut a rope simply go into one of the links here and increase the radius to something say point I don't know point one eight it's going to be plenty I think far I taste and that should make sure that you can just kind of drag your mouse across and it's going to remove one link each time now we go that's pretty much all we needed for this game from here you can go and create levels by simply moving around ropes and using the building scene switching tools in order to switch between them you can add collectables that are rewarded whenever they get hit by the weight that's simply adding a Collider to the weight and then adding some kind of trigger to the collectible and then having something accrue once you do that and then also have some way of maybe put a frog in there to check if the ball reaches the end and if it does put up some kind of in screen that displays a score all this stuff is something I feel we've covered in in other videos another live stream so it's something that you should be able to pretty easily apply to this one so now you can just go ahead and go nuts I mean this is super fun and if you want to say remove the entire chain and not just cut it where we do what you can do is go in here and you can destroy instead of destroying hit collided our game object with them to destroy hit cool or it hit that transform dot parent that's the entire rope dart game object so we send we call destroy on that instead and whoops let me just try and save that and now when we play and try and slice a rope it's just going to get rid of the entire room oh and that also deletes the anchor but if you want you can just go ahead and leave the anger as a separate object or some kind of parent object and then have it delete everything else it's totally up to you what you could also do is go in here and kind of do both so in the very beginning here it's going to destroy only the arm the part of the chain that we hit and then after say two seconds it's going to destroy the entire rope and then you can have it fade out using some kind of alpha animation so that's what they do in the original game I know is is everything actually disappears after a second or so but you can actually see on the rope being cut so it's it's totally up to you you could also go ahead and remove all masts on the chain so that after it's being cut it doesn't have any physical influence on on the weight itself there's lots of stuff you can do so I feel that's pretty much everything that we needed to cover in this video I just want to go ahead and try and create really really large chain let's see we can select this one let's try and create something with forty links see what happens oh now that's chaotic it actually works I was I'm surprised to see that this doesn't break in some way but I it actually behaves pretty well well it's so cool let's zoom out with the camera here let's see our huge chain working and nevermind the background all that's awesome I'm a huge fan of this you can now take the chain here let's drag it up here and see what happens look at it go oh that's so cool and we can splice this up in any way that we want to okay so as you can see there's plenty of fun to be had with this so I hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial part of this our video now we're going to switch over to a Q&A format so if you guys have any questions whatsoever write them to me in the chat and I will do my best to answer and also we'll have a look at some blue blue team Diaries stuff in just a second here so that's awesome so let me just switch over to chat format there we go and now you should be able to see the chat as well and let me start reading some questions here do I have a college degree no I do not please make a complete level with it I am sorry that's all we're going to be doing today but I will have the project file for you if you want to get it for yourself let me see couldn't you just disable them yeah of course you can disable them as well if you don't want to remove them completely that would be I would recommend putting some kind of animation that fades out the Alpha channel that would look pretty cool and in general I would probably recommend using a line renderer but if you want to learn more about line renderer so you should check out our I think the a few months ago but we did a live stream on kind of doing a acting to cool also called curve fever on replica and that's pretty cool so that that's using the new unity line renderer from five point six five point five I don't exactly remember when it was introduced but it's a lot better and you should be able to fairly easily apply it here simply have each game object act as a point in the line renderer and and which it should look cool I'm from Denmark how long have you been working on games I've been creating games pretty much my entire life or at least the live voice at least trying to but I've been working professionally with games since I started this channel very much which is five years ago something like that then maybe a year or two before that trying to kind of get into the whole thing but the channel here and I have pretty much grown together how did you learn programming that world oh thank you after all the mistakes I just made I made you think a program well well that's that's awesome you guys are too generous I I learn programming are from mostly unity tutorials back then it was well it depends on what you mean programming I've learned many different programming languages in both web and and other runtime languages and if you if you're talking about game development mostly in unity then it was YouTube tutorials and it's also my preferred work a way of learning back then it was tomato twinks that helped me get started how did you make the camera follow script and shrinking plan and I do not want to talk about that check out the source code it's it's on the Ludum dare a page and you can you can see for yourself it's not pretty do you have some secret knowledge as well a little bit I'm not a good see let's watch programmer but I can read most C++ codes because some of it gets really hairy but I feel I know my way around the language wouldn't be comfortable getting a job having to write C++ code but on a hobby level it's fine I guess let's see have I finished the university haven't even started so no I don't plan to go to university not at least not for now I'm having too much fun with this and I find that I can can do much more creative stuff this way and if I went to university so let's see can you actually make a living from mobile games you can but it's super tough the mobile game industry has kind of changed in the beginning when everyone was first getting into the app market it was really if you got an app on the App Store and if you got just a tiny bit featured you could make a lot of money on that that time is long long gone there are so many competing apps especially games now that cracking that market is just the most difficult thing ever you can definitely make a living creating games but you need contacts or you need budget and you need to create many games not just one having being able to live off of one game is rare just telling your heart is it still super fun though and I recommend you do it the source code you posted under is not working for me I'm sorry I don't know why that would be pretty sure I tested it it worked for me before then I'm using JUnit II 5.6 so I think you should make sure that you're using the same version I haven't heard any other complaints that it wasn't working so yeah I'm sorry I can't really troubleshoot that with you right now how do you get assets for games dev assets of course if you go to dev assets calm you can download free high quality asset packs pay what you want so you can choose the price and that means a minimum of price of zero but definitely awesome if you want to help support me in the artists that's a good place you and the asset store is a great place and yeah those are probably the two biggest ones that I can think of this let's see here isn't it extensive to live in Copenhagen yes Copenhagen this is an expensive city so yeah it is and not really much to say about that Copenhagen is just overall expensive do you code your own shaders do you think unity should implement a material node inspector like unreal engines so arm I do sometimes delve into the world of shader programming when I do it not pretty I've done a few successful shaders mostly I do it following some kind of tutorial but I feel now that I mostly do it out of habit because I'm not comfortable writing shaders but most of the time and I can do it without however especially since unity updated to the new standard shader there are some things that I haven't really rubbed my head around mostly because I get to do it so rarely but I think it's really fun to do I think that's really something really gratifying about creating code that directly affects graphics that's really fun and that's just so much creative stuff you can do which with shaders so I don't know why I haven't gotten into it more it's probably just because um you guys haven't been asking for it on the channel and most of what I do with unity is is for the channel in terms of grading a node editor that would be the coolest thing ever but then again there are some really good assets out there such as shader Forge that allow you to do that so as long as there is a method and this time there there is I don't think it should be that top priority at the moment definitely not I think the standard shader suits 99% of of what you need to do with with shaders I did pick up blender recently though ah got plenty I did start using blender again recently because I wanted to prepare for the series and also because I just think blender so so fun and I mean their node editor is just amazing so it is hard not to get envious of that but I really mean it's it's it's more of a fun thing than it's something that's really needed um thank you for the compliments by the way guys what programming language would you recommend for a beginner depends on what you want to do I would always recommend the programming language that gets you or that allows you to do what you want to do the quickest because I think the most important thing for beginners is capturing their interest and showing them that programming is not books and it's not API programming is creative and it's something that allows you to make something and so I would always say if you want to make a webpage start with HTML you can get something up and running right away if you want to make something sciency or if you want to make automated tasks or anything like that start with Python if you want to make games maybe start with unity or maybe not maybe start with something easier like JavaScript or um like regular JavaScript not unity script or maybe game maker so totally depends on what you want to do but I do believe that unity is a great tool for showing how creative you can be with always programming I am 20 years old ah why unity over unreal no particular reason because I don't really favor unity over unreal okay that's a lie I do favor unity over and rely on quite a few things but I think that whenever it comes to what engineer should choose it totally depends on what game you want to make so unity over unreal is just a matter of me thinking that unity fits the types of games that I make most of the time I've never actually embarked upon a project where I thought one wheel would be a better guess especially because most of the stuff that I do is done by me alone when it comes to game projects and if I had a bigger team I would probably say otherwise what's your favorite game have one will Duvall craft counterstrike I can know one of the big tiles I think um exactly unity and unreal both have their good and bad points let's let's tell you right let's see for a web developer and designer mainly using javascript CSS HTML sometimes PHP which is the best program to start making games I'd like to make some simple but fun games in my spare time unity I know I can use chaos and unity to yeah I think if you have experience with web development pick up unity I think game maker is probably the big contester when it comes to quickly getting into making games using some kind of a engine with an interface not that you want to go the riot route of clips or anything like that but I would always recommend picking up unity then just because javascript is going to be very familiar to you and allows you to not so much focus on language but more focus on what's unity specific what does it mean making a game also kind of get you in the groove of managing assets and setting up scenes and levels and what all these different dials mean without the big overhead so yeah I would suggest you in any video definitely um let's see am I ever going to do a gaming stream at least the stream that isn't tutorial related maybe for this stream I actually thought about creating or making an entire stream where I only play Ludum dare games that you guys have made or other games that you might want me to play and that could be super fun to do I want to play what you make and see what you are able to do especially maybe if the game was inspired by a tutorial of mine that would be I mean it's always awesome to see the what you put out there it's actually maybe helping someone so that could be really fun to do and with that let's play some games let's do it so I'm going to jump on let's see here let's change the layout again they are just changing guys so let's go to LG Jem calm and I am going to log in here and I'm going to do that off screen um and I don't remember the login well I did it's great so here the note if you don't know Ludum dare I say game development competition where you get 48 hours to create a game from scratch using only selfmade assets and it's super fun look that's me Hey haha that's so cool I didn't know that these were showing up in on the Ludum dare a side that's fun huh anyway it's a 48 hours way that you get to make a game from scratch using some kind of theme and the theme this time was small world and I made a game called shrinking planet and it looks like this and it allows you to drive around the small planet while trying to avoid meteors and I found this fire icon and it's gotta be super cool and you can go ahead and download it I'm just going to throw a link in the description here to those who want to check that out you can play it in the web browser let's just actually try and maybe have a quick play here and let me see if I can get some desktop all your working I think I think maybe that it's streaming the audio but I really have no idea let's try and hit play here and it does black in the beginning a tiny bit in whoops in the browser here and you can also see the grass shader is nearly as nice in the browser I don't know why I played in a nice browser I think I already have it installed actually fit through this write shrinking planet no no yes maybe shrinking planet bilks windows x86 there we go cool it's booting up now yeah I wanted to show you guys to grass shader it's the best part it's year I made it using a tutorial by Ellen Saucony you can see how much better that looks now so I have no idea if audio is coming through let me know is that that's working if not it's not too important just wanted to maybe get that set up soon because some of the games I thought this dude and I really had really nice audio that I thought should be showcased if not you can always watch my video on kind of behind the scenes stuff so I did a a not so much a postmortem but more of a making us video on this particular game it's it's up now on the YouTube channel go check that out and the cool thing is look how well we did guys tada we were number one in theme yes celebration and the white balance on my camera is the love I feel eighty eight eighty HD today hyper it's probably because I've had to do so much boring work so this week I'm pretty excited to to be doing some live streaming and we we got number eight in graphics and um numbers 13 overall so I'm super happy about this I mean it's a huge improvement from my last submission first of all and it's also just getting number one in a category it's so cool ah so I was really really excited about this um I think some of the judgments here are not really fair I don't think necessarily that I did that well in innovation and I definitely think um that my humor rating should have been lower as well because I had no jokes in there whatsoever so I I think some of these are a bit too good but I'm happy about it I shouldn't complain but yeah so and and the feedback that you guys left was just awesome I mean look at all these comments and a lot of really good feedback as well I spoke to Sebastian as well he also left a comment here Sebastian leg if you know him personally BRR he did a he had some really nice feedback I think one of the main problems with this game it was also something that I wanted to add but simply hadn't didn't have the time is the fact that you can just drive straight and then not get hit by meteors for 10 20 seconds that's the problem I should have some kind of targeting that sometimes put a meteor in front of the players or he has to react that would make it a lot better also feel that sometimes it's a bit too fast paced and it feels unfair when you simply aren't able to dodge a media or even though you were trying your hardest so it's also something that I should have a look at but overall I was really happy with the submission and if you didn't watch the last stream ah Sophia my lovely fiancee um did a game as well called me 'dom so look at this so here you go that was her first Ludum dare a submission and she did well as well for first submission she got a number 66 in humor that's pretty cool I also really liked her interpretation of the team actually thought that 120 wasn't enough for that because her theme interpretation is awesome I think pretty much everyone did something with small planets including myself and I don't really think it's fair that I got more in theme but but alright it's I guess it's the voting system so shouldn't complain but you can check that out as well I'll leave a link in the chat if you want to go play that as well so yeah guys um if you have a little diary submission that you want me to play or a game that you made using one of my tutorials keep it a little diary here in the beginning maybe definitely through it in the in the description I want to check it out this one here called battlehex it sounds cool oh no this looks complicated yes let's try it out and oh you didn't get enough ratings hmm one rating tsys I'm sorry download the game on your chair let's do that dddd oh it's a WebGL perfect those are the best points I'm just gonna add it to the water while it's loading okay so the goal is to either remove all enemy pawns or find the chest with gold this game is meant to be played with two players on one screen oh do you want to join in awesome I've no idea what to do we should be two players and I don't know how this is what's going on okay I think this is you now it's some kind of I have no idea to tell us what to do here come Jane let's sit closer okay I guess I'll try to press over you oh okay so you can I think you should place units down here but you can only place at the beginning so it's like it's like chess all right and I guess the bluest water in the ground is grass I think you should hit okay now without knowing anything let's click to choose a pond and child to move to right click and drag or vast keys to move the camera all right so I can choose a pawn now oh let's see and it's about getting the gold I think okay my turn yeah I'm going aggressively for the gold when you start you have to play three punch on the first row of the board and then click ok button right top right corner this will start a gaming reason and then to attack an enemy spawn I open the chest you have to strike backwards okay yes I'll do that okay this is going to be easy we place a chest sometimes you know sparring on the channel good yeah I'm going to be used to this one I'm sorry can i huh you have to strike backwards well so you have to get in front of it I don't I want to do this can I can I do this now nope how do I get the cold yes yes I did it boom one zero no no no my chest so I think some some things that are really working for this game are the overall feel of the movement I mean the controls are snappy and it's clear to see where the where the units eye on what's going on I don't necessarily need thing that you need to be able to control the camera I think maybe just a more topdown view would be fine kind of like and chest you don't really see the ability to move the camera there also the music is working one thing that I do find a bit weird is kind of reading how the environment affect the decision you make I find right now it's mostly maybe because I'm not too good at it just a matter of racing to the nearest chest and I don't see many layers of strategy I don't really see how the colors of the board affect your okay so that's pretty annoying okay so that's actually really annoying um so yeah overall cool game yeah shouldn't have done that I'm gonna get you now okay and game over got the gold yes thanks for joining in it okay cool so I'm going to put back the black screen but everything still works Cole I'm going to close down the game here if you guys have any more games I would love to try them out just throw a link in in the chat and we'll have look also I will readjust the white balance on my camera here because it's it's bad it's really red let's see if we can make that better that's a bit better good enough so yeah throw me links let me see you guys had a bunch of links last time so I hope that you guys throw me something this time as well I just have to update my chat here as well because it's it's for some reason is just stuck cold so toniest tony has a game as well it's called what's it called miniature adventure oh that's cool so you didn't get enough ratings of flood it was a huge problem with duda at this time no one was getting ratings and it's because the rating system got out so so late and yeah everything just got pushed pushed back but okay so this looks like something on that I can figure out how to do made in a in Gia's with my custom engine that's cool man next to begin all right I'm in bored hell yeah loving the music already failing but loving the music I don't know if you guys are able to hear this music but it's awesome oh you get made smaller oh it's so cool right God's the spikes which I said to do Jesus okay can do this this is your own engine that's awesome well I'm loving this and so here everything's smaller well that's really cool one thing I would probably do for this is I'll make sure to swim in the camera a bit more once the our player gets small I find it's a bit too far away maybe in order to be able to see all the action but I really like the shrinking mechanic also one thing that you can do is maybe interpolate between the two sizes because right now it just instantly gets small it would be cool if it kind of gradually zoomed in instead but these are just small smaller points okay so we're going down oh oh well that's so cool ah I think I failed yeah I've got oh yes but the music is perfect I feel like if the Leno is superhero something oh ok so that felt unfair there you go pretty much have to make sure that always lands on the top one there it's not nice dying and not really feeling that you have a stay in Y trends one more time okay this time I'll get it stand there go here go there oh I have to go to the other side Jesus okay we do the case stand here now go here and there we go yes perfect level complete Oh No that doesn't look right Oh see I have to go to the other side here this is super cool time racing and with your minute yourself ah to be fast no not gonna make it I just made it all it's so cold okay so this are these these levels is falling levels ah the worst I can never do it my reactionary skills of way too bad for this so anyway I don't know have to do it ah see not gonna happen feel old when I get these levels yep this is why I'm giving up awesome game man really enjoying it I think the graphics are nice minimalistic they do what they should and yeah oh well good game well done let's see let's see if there are any other links here to try out we may be a trial run one more didn't get much most votes so that you can play tennis again it's my first interest I hope you enjoyed all right we'll check it out asteroid shooter oh that looks cool I believe I saw this actually on there download there we go and just wait for this turn on download and install see so this is a game by ah oh where is it Mick well L mm final build yes please let's just put this on the desktop clean up in a sec okay so this is probably going to be the last game guys then we'll wrap up the stream because also have to kind of process all of the footage and upload stuff to github and such but it I had a blast that's for sure so let's try and coconut asteroid chew here let's do a windowed one here too and small new size choose that one yes that's perfect play see what this is about play game arrow keys to control alright you can do that oh yes okay I get it right away okay so the controls here really nice it's really it's actually fairly easy to hit the asteroid to think something about the speed is well balanced really like are the exploding graphics as well really really simple particles but they do that job and now we get big asteroids it's a good thing that you have health bars in here what you could also do is maybe just have the asteroids shrink instead each time you hit them that way it gets more and more difficult the more you play or on the morass the more you hit the asteroid kind of have chunks follow them I really like how you have the asteroid split up into multiple ones that's kind of adds another layer but I think you could do that with helps us walk maybe but ya don't know why this didn't we'd get that much many votes this is an awesome game as well oh no you're perfect so I mean a simple thing that you could add on this type of game I joined game over it's some kind of upgrade menu I think this is one of those games that could really keep people hooked if you get a way to upgrade your planet up get more guns in there get health upgrades shields automatic turret turrets nuclear bombs that kind of destroy everything on the screen stuff like that you could also have it so that you shoot up grapes around the screen so if you just take your time maybe a few seconds to shoot something on the screen that business asteroid in return you get some kind of bonus powerup so that's something that I would probably add there but really well done so I believe that is all that we are going to do today so that's pretty much the end of the livestream guys I hope you enjoyed it I really did as always and yeah if you want to watch this live stream it will be up later on YouTube along with the github project so you can download everything
