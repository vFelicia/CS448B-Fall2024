oh the search become way too long for video you can't have that in there I must type this away thanks for tuning in at Brack ease hello and welcome to video number 16 on making a multiplayer FPS in unity today we are going to be fixing the bug that I pointed out in the last video but when we spawn a player in he will change the health and settings for all of the other players that also means spawning a particle effect on all of the other players that are already in the game and that looks super weird and it's not a behavior that we want so we're going to separate that out so that's going to be really good to finally take care of and also we are going to be moving some of our functionality when joining a network into a separate scene I want to now create the idea of two separate scenes one offline scene where we are connect to other players or choose to host a game and later that will be our maybe lobby or indid where people can join your join your game before it starts and stuff like that and then we transition over to the online scene where the game actually takes place so without further ado let's dig right into it so you can see that I am here in unity and I'm just going to load up our main level scene here and first off let me just demonstrate what is currently going wrong when we play the game so let me just make a very quick build here I'm simply pressing ctrl B to make that build very quickly and it's going to open up here and I'm going to go into unity here wait for the lighting to repack and then hit play and then we are going to select maybe our land host here and then over here we can select align client and you will notice that the other guy spawns a particle system as well so that means that we are calling a certain method if we go under our player and then play a set up and then open that script up in Visual Studio there is a very special method in this script and it's called setup and we are calling that on all of the different players we should be calling it on all clients but only on the player that currently joined so you can see here we have this start method here and we are calling the setup method under the player script and that's the one up here and this one takes care of setting the defaults for our players so that will first off it will spawn in a particle system here a spawn effect it will also switch the cameras enable colliders and set the current health value to the maximum health so this is just setting up the default player and we of course only want to this to happen for newly joined players we don't want this to be called for all the players when a new player joins so that the entire game is just like reset so in order to fix this we need to kind of separate our understanding of the newly turned player from the other players and the way to do this if we go under our player setup script you can see that we are calling this from the start method well when we join as a new player a start method is going to be called on all of the different players that is because for our local instance all of the different players that we are joining in the lobby will be spawned into the scene and therefore their start method will be called however what is true for only our player is that we are marked as a local player so for the client that joins in only his own player will be marked as a local player and therefore we can take this setup method and remove it from here and up under this else statement so if we're not the local player we're going to disable components and a side of them assign a remote layer and stuff like that at l's we are going to call the set of method on our player and let's just rename this to player setup just so we are completely sure of what this is doing and that was basically all we need to change in here at least for now we need to fix it back down here in a moment then for our player if we go in here we find our player setup method you can see that that now been renamed to from here we are now only calling this on the client of the local player on the player so that's all so we need to kind of transmit this idea of setting the defaults to all of the other clients so that when a new player joins it's not only joined on the actual client that is joining but all the other players can see him as well and can see the spawn prefab and his health gets set and all that stuff so we need to it in other words to initialize this player on all the clients so in order to do this we are going to use an RPC and the best way of using and a client RPC I can remember any method that is marked as a client RPC will be called on all clients the best way to call one of these is from a command so let's start by making a command so in order to do this we are going to take all of this code and simply copy it and then we can make a private void here and we are going to call this maybe CMD and this is the broadcast new player set up something like that just don't be afraid of using very long names if they are descriptive of what we are doing and this is basically what we're doing we are telling this server to broadcast out to all the different clients that a new player should be set up so you can of course call this something else if that makes more sense to you but I think this will be pretty clear on what we're doing and then from here we want to call an RPC so we can now make that as well we mark this as an a a client client RPC and we make this again a private void because we're only calling it from the same script and we are marking this as an RPC and this is the set up player on all clients call and in here we want to check for or initialize this array and we want to call this set defaults method and of course we need to call the RPC from the sir and we need to let the server know from the local player client so that is kind of all we need to do here then what we need to do as well is we need to separate setting up the player from managing on the current active camera and the current active UI because currently we are using this switch cameras which is wrapped in an if statement and we kind of need to separate this out all the other code we can leave be but this shouldn't be handled in this set defaults this should instead be handled up here before we actually call this on the command because we only want to switch the camera and enable the player UI on the local player we don't need all of the other clients doing that as well and since when in the player setup we are checking if we are the local player before we call and player setup let's really no need to wrap this in an if state and so we can just go ahead and delete that if statement and just have these two method calls for themselves good and of course when we are switching the cameras here we are setting the scene camera to false and the player UI to true we also need a way of or we also need to do this in the respawn sit down here so since we are not no longer including this in the set defaults we need to just well put it in here so we need to switch the cameras here as well so when we respawn again we set the scene camera active to false and we are said instead on the UI player UI to true good so that should actually be all and I know we didn't do this in the last video but it kind of had to think about a somewhat robust way of doing this and notice that I still have this kill command in here so we can use that in a moment because there is still a problem with this so let's try and go in here and just first let's try this on the local players let's try and hit play and so the gland host and you can see that this is indeed working and we can I can stop him from playing and everything is enabling and disabling as we would want it to so that now let's try and make a build of this so controlv or commandv if you're on a Mac and let's see if this is working on the on the player and the build player here as well so wait for the light to rebuild here hit play on that and it should also be playing here and what we'll be doing is we'll select land host here and we'll select land client here and you can see now it only spawns the prefab for this particular client so that's perfect and you will also see that if we go ahead and damage this guy you can see on the console it says he now has let's say 75 health and we then drop out here we disconnect and you note will notice something weird with the cameras here but we're going to fix that in just a moment and then we join us a client again and find the player in there he is and damage him and go in the console here it's spamming with these all it's spamming way too much we can maybe maybe we cannot find it I'll just try to now this is going way too crazy unfortunately okay so let's fix it and fix this error instead so what is happening here well let's just move out of our build here what is happening here is that um if we find or set the false method we are not doing anything with the camera here but in our player setup on the disabled meaning when we are destroyed and we are basically only destroyed whenever we choose to disconnect well then it's setting the scene camera active to true but it's doing that for all of the clients not only the local player so we need to check if we are the local players so if is local player well then we can change the cameras okay so that makes sense so now when we try and hit play here and we can maybe try and connect disconnect that looks fine we can try and kill ourselves here by pressing K in seed jumps out here to the scene view and jumps back in so that's perfect and now we can try and build this so uh let's build it and that was the bug that I was talking about before I just wanted to show you what that did it it simply triggered the camera flow for all of the players but which of course it's not something we we desire so let's hit play here host Lang client you know response for this guy damage this this guy bid so now he's on seventy health disconnect everything is okay over here everything is okay over here let's connect again all right well we spawned out on top of each other there that was kind of weird that was because we didn't move of course we can implement some kind of way of checking for that and then we can now damage him again and you can see it remembers what health amount he was on so it's no longer reset as it was before and that's super good so now we can kill him and he explodes him goes to the scene view there and he jumps back in and he should oh well now he's no longer spawning on this guy's Network so what's going on here well I'm just going to pause the camera here and then I'll be back in a moment alright so I figured out what was going wrong it seems that we are only calling these set defaults method under our respawn method and I set defaults is not marked as a client RPC so that kind of goes wrong because um we are only calling this on the local client of the local player and that's not good we want to set up the player that has respond on all of the different clients so what we want to do is instead called the player whoops the player setup method and I'm just going to go ahead and rename this to setup player because then we won't confuse it with the player setup script I think that's a better idea now we can also take all of this and simply remove it because we are doing that under this set of player method anyways then let's go up to a set of player and configure this a bit so now we want to check whether or not whoops that's a phone going off whether or not we are the local player so if is local player well then we want to do all of this stuff we deleted it before because we were only calling it from one place but now we're also calling it from down there so that would be a good idea okay so now that we have this in here everything else should be working however we only want to do this operation at the very beginning when we first join in not every time we respond because this remembers what components we was enabled and therefore it knows what to enable again when we respawn and we don't want to set that to some kind of value right before we will want to enable things again so what we do here is simply do a some kind of private float or I mean some kind of private bowl which is name is first set up or maybe just first set up and we default that to true and then down here we simply write if first set up then we can do this kind of initialization stuff and then after we've done that we set first set up to false this way we only do this once it's maybe a bit of a hack but it works very solid okay and then down here on a respawn method now we are setting our position and our rotation on the network and it will kind of throw that out on the network and make sure it's synced to everyone using another component and then we are calling the setup layer which will then throw a message out to all the different clients to set up the player probably however we want to make sure that this position and rotation is submitted to all of the different players of transport as transferred to all of the different clients before we set up the player else we will have a case where we are on not we haven't moved the player or it seems that the player hasn't moved because he hasn't declined hasn't received a message to move him and then respond the particles in the wrong place so I simply want to put in just a tiny bit of an error margin here a yield return new waitforseconds where we weights a point zero or 0.1 second that should be plenty it's not knows that noticeable in the game and it's a very easy idea if you want to or it's very easy thing to do if you just want to delay this a little bit to make sure that we are moving the player before instantiating the particles so if we try this now this should look super cool so let's try and build the player and this should hopefully be the final time we need to mess with this and then we can leave it be for a while it's very confusing confusing to do this stuff trust me I know and then we can hit play go on dear land host go on delaying client and we can kill this guy off and see if it works so go he explodes and you should respawn there that's perfect and we can do the same again he explodes there and he should respawn over there and he does so that's perfect so that's a small delay made sure that everything is not working as it should good so now that this is on working the game should be very playable and you should definitely be able to try this out so what I want to do is now just clean up some of the code here so I want to take this if input get keyed down here this kill method and maybe just comment that out and since we're not using the entire update method I'm just going to Mike all of that with comments so that's perfect and the next thing that I wanted to do just very quickly in this video is have an offline scene and an online scene this is of course our online scene so let's go ahead and make a new scene pressing ctrl N and let's go ahead and say this as maybe our loppy scene just Lobby maybe and this can be our this can still be our main level and we can just go ahead and maybe remove the directional light we're not going to be using that so simply delete that and we can make a UI here simply an image that we will stretch to in the entire screen by holding down alt and clicking down here and this is just going to be a fairly dark color something like that just very flat some kind of very simple UI could be put in here let me go to our main level we find our network manager take her to spawn points and move them out of here somewhere we can maybe move them down here then we take our network manager we drag in our main level under the online scene and our lobby under the offline scene oops we need to add it to the build settings so file build settings drag in the lobby scene and we want that to be appearing before our main level and now we can drag it in here we can then take our network manager and turn it into a prefab so let's drag it under the prefabs folder we can then load in our lobby scene find our prefabs folder and drag back in the network manager here so now we need to make sure that this is synced and that your apply changes to the prefab here so now when we hit play in here we are in a separate scene when we hit land host it transitions the scene however you'll notice a small bug and that is that the lining is currently very weird when we do this it's not really baked and the reason for this is that unity dynamically bakes the lining in the scene but when it transitions to a new scene it sometimes doesn't do that so let's just go and find our lighting this is found on the window lighting and then going to the light maps tab and down here it's currently set to auto if we just disable that and hit build to build the lining one last time and you will need to do this every time you change the lighting in the scene from now on this error shouldn't happen so if we go to a lobby hit play LAN host you can see that the lighting is correctly built so now we have this kind of a cool relationship between a lobby scene where we are offline and a mainlevel scene where we are online later we can expand this to having players join maybe you can select a character whatever there's plenty of opportunity to this so that's kind of all I wanted to show you for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one
