so just finished my entry into Ludum dare 41 and it was a huge amount of fun to those of you who don't know um Daria is a massive game dev competition where you have 48 hours to create a game from scratch that means you do all the art code and sound yourself for this dunam diary we all decided to participate so we packed up all like gear and set it up in our friend's apartment we then went home for a good night's sleep and when we woke up the next day the theme had already been announced it was to combine two incompatible genres so naturally we started brainstorming genres on the whiteboard trying to figure out weird ways to combine them I'll be completely honest and say that I thought this was actually a really hard challenge finally I settled on the idea of combining a realism based crafting game with fantasy adventure elements the game feels a lot like a sandbox where you combine different reallife elements to create materials you then combine materials to create tools and use the tools to gather more materials but then out of the blue you stumble upon this weird magical substance and suddenly the game is all about figuring out this magical world and I don't want to spoil it but you do end up fighting bad guys with this idea in mind it was time to boot up unity I started by creating some basic UI elements trying to figure out how the crafting would work I decided to go with the simplest possible solution combine two things get a result i implemented drag and drop to move things around and it was already really eager to start adding some items however I knew that I had to first come up with a quick way to create items and item recipes that would make it easy to edit them later for this I decided to use scriptable objects which later turned out to be a wide choice basically I created two based scriptable objects one for items which contained a name as well as an icon and one for recipes which contained information about which items to combine in order to create a new one using this symbol structure it was pretty quick to get crafting working with the UI I also had in an inventory the keep track of all items the player has as the game progresses and at this point I was ready to start adding items but I still needed to figure out exactly what items I wanted in my game and more importantly which ones combined into what to help visualize this I started creating a graph of all the items that I wanted in the game and I think this is often something that is overlooked when talking about game making planning and visualizing tasks can be extremely useful and I can easily say that without this graph I would have never finished the game in time now finally I could start going through the list and creating icons for each of the items also quickly threw together some sprites to make the UI a bit nicer and once I was happy with it I threw it into the editor and voila I actually had something working I only had around 5 items but still the idea was there from here spend most of the evening creating lots of different icons for items I must say I really enjoyed this part most of the games I make are often really focused on gameplay and because of that I normally use most of my time programming but for this game everything revolved around having enough items to make it feel interesting and plentiful and it was also a great excuse to practice my pixel art skills even though I will admit I found inspiration in a few places well once I had some more items in place it was time to find a good way of introducing magic to the player for this I created a reward manager that would track the amount of items the player heads and give extra rewards such as man tegu once the player has progressed to a certain point and it was at this time that I started having my friends play test the game and man did I learn a lot from doing so I found out that rewarding the player with extra items worked really well and everyone got super excited when they found the magic goo so I started thinking of other rewards to give the player also learned that I definitely needed more items in the game and to avoid people from getting stuck I had to create multiple ways to craft the same items after updating the graph to reflect these thoughts I added some UI to highlight new items when they are discovered I also used this as a way to communicate story to the player and tell a few jokes along the way which ended up being a crucial part of the game and that was pretty much the end of day one next morning I felt pretty well rested and started to slave away at all the new items that I thought up the day before these were really fun to do because a lot of them were more interesting and magical which is great because it took pretty much the entire day I also added an item counter to help the playa keep track of his progress as well as some fancy UI animations to help tie everything together on that I've pretty much been the entire night doing lots and lots of play testing I asked my friends to play the game one by one to find out where they were getting stuck and between each I would go in and add or change items to smooth out the experience with the core game done and only a few hours to go I still wanted to add audio unfortunately at this time unity decided to stop working altogether and I had to reinstall meanwhile I had time to record some sounds and once unity was back up and running I quickly added them all together and created an icon for the game I also realized that I needed a name for the king at this point I felt like I was pretty much running out of good ideas so I went with me fairly unoriginal crafty I guess it works just fine and that was it as always I submitted just before the deadline this is me at 4 a.m. time to catch up on some lost sleep let's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe and maybe check out some of our other behind the scenes videos on that thanks for watching and
