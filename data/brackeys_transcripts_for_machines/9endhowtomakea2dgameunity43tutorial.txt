thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to the last video in going to Dee today we are going to export our game after just a few fixes and changes here and there and I'm going to basically show you how to export it both to the web and to a standalone that basically means Linux Windows and Mac cool so before we get started today I just quickly want to talk about why it's taking me so long to put out a video I'm sorry but I've been sick I hope you can't hear it on my voice anymore nothing serious but that letter slowed things down and more importantly I've been working on tin our games so as you see the wallpaper here I participated in the event I'm hosting cold 10 our games and basically what it is is it's not a competition but a way for people to get cracking on whatever game they want to make so it's more of a concept or a challenge if you will so a lot of cool people have already entered some games but I'm going to keep the event going for long in for for a long time and I would like to see more they're there room for many many more creations so please go to breakage to calm / 10 hour games to watch the video and read about it it's really awesome and I am looking forward to seeing what you come up with cool so now let's get started with today's video so as always I've opened up unity and if we go in here there's just a quick fix I want to do and that's whenever you play on full screen the ball has quite a bit of space to travel on and so I think the game just becomes a little bit too easy so what I want to do is I want to select the player prefab down here so I will change for them both at the same time and I want to bump down down the wire scale to something like 0.8 just to make the players a bit smaller and so it will be hard for them to hit the ball go so that was just a a quick gameplay fix of course that's something you should play around with to get it working for your game awesome so now we're going to go to file no yeah file and then build settings or press ctrl shift B we're not ready to build and run yet so in here we can first off make sure that we have added our scenes to the build I've already added the main level here so if not it will just be blank and you can hit add current and it will add the scene so that it will load up when you build the game then you can see currently we have PC Mac and Linux standalone selected if you want to select something else like the web player just to simply select and hit and hits which platform and then unity will reimport things and rearrange it so it works for that platform but let's do PC Mac and Linux first so first off let's select the target platform I'm just going to show you how to do this on Windows and then the architecture you can choose between 86 and 64 and 86 basically means 32 so I'm on a 64bit system so I'm going to export to that and if you are doing a development build meaning that this is not the final export or not something that you're going to roll out to customers you can select that and it will basically say it in the corner that it's a development build also let's hit player settings to change some things in the inspector first off we make sure that you're under the standalone tab and let's first change the company name or that could be just your name if you don't have a company but I'm just going to do break ease here and the product name is going to be pong tutorial then the default icon I've gone ahead and created a very simple and again very simple icon for this game your feel free to use it if you want so that's of course in the assets pack so if you go to break calm you can download it it you can download it there and by the way I've made the site much faster now done a bunch of optimizations so it should just work really nicely but I'm just going to find it on my local hard drive here on the 2d assets pack under pong and icon here so again very simple but it works so let's drag this into the unity editor and drag it into the project pane and then select it make sure to select GUI and hit apply try again there and then go back to the player settings and we can set it as the default icon so let's just drag it in there the default cursor we're going to leave that and the same with the cursor hotspot now in the resolution and presentation because this is such a casual game I want to change the default is fullscreen to off so that I mean the game just simply doesn't require a full screen you can do stuff while you are playing and such so I think it's better if it's just windowed by default the default screen width and height and that's in pixels I'm just going to leave that I think that's quite fine and the rest of this we can pretty much leave I mean the icon is fine the splash image we're not going to mess with that the other render settings are for mode man advanced stuff so we're just going to leave everything and now we are ready to build our game so simply hit built and then we can select a destination and I'm just going to call this pong tutorial build and then it's always good to do a version number so I'll just do version let's do 0 1 then we hit save and it's going to just make sure that you save and then as an exe there are not in all files and hit save so now unit is going to go ahead and build out our game and it's just going to take a quick moment and now we are done so now on our desktop we should have a first off an exe file with the icon I know it's not pretty and a folder called the icon name and then underscore data and this is where many people get confused because I mean they think that whenever they build they just get an install file and you can go through the installation and then there's a shortcut on your desktop and all that good stuff but that's not really true I mean unity builds it out as a standalone but that doesn't mean that you have an installation yet so what we have here is an exe file with some data and we can now run the game as you can see and we can select everything just how we wanted actually the graphics quality well that's really annoying right now the graphics quality you have all kinds of settings and I don't really think that's required so let's just go back into unity and this is why we put version numbers in there so let's go back into unity let's go under the project settings quality and in here we can delete some of all those graphics settings so because we don't really need this much so let's delete everything but good actually so let's just delete that and that that that and that so we only have good and we can just set that as default for all the different platforms if you wanna I'm just going to clean it clean it up there and then we're going to say standard or if you're feeling cocky you can do awesome I'm just going to do standard and then the pixel light count that doesn't really matter we in a 2d game we don't have any lights so just leave it full rest sounds good per texture is fine until icing we're not going to do any of that and yeah basically just leave all the settings here so now we should be good to go so if we go ahead and Bill the game once more so going here and hit built and we're going to just do let's just overwrite this so yeah and it's going to go ahead and build the game one more time and there we are so now if we go in here and we double click on this we can see that we only have one graphics level and that's the standard you can't go ahead and customize this configuration thing I'm not going to go into that this is just the easy way and it works I mean I've never heard anyone complain about the launcher so let's hit play and you can see that our game launches it says powered by unity some people asked how to get that away you have to buy unity Pro in order to scratch that and we can see that this is working just how we wanted and we're gonna press reset and everything should be working yeah this cool so now let's close that down and we can go ahead and talk a little bit about how to make this into an installable so for that you will need an a dedicated program and there are free programs out there but most of them have limitations so just go ahead and find the one right for you there's one called was what is it actual installed err I've used this once for a kill pill it's quite all right I mean it the ICI version does what is is is needed but there are many alternatives to this just check it out search for it searched for make installable unity and you will get plenty of comparisons and all that to pick which one is right for you and and it's pretty easy you just select the exe file and the data and it will make everything for you so that's something you want to consider if you want to deploy to many systems awesome so that was it for this standalone version now let's go ahead and do the web player so let's say switch platform and let's just check out the player settings to make sure everything is ok and then here we can do it default screen width and height I think this is okay it's in the smaller size but that's alright and I'm just going to leave the default template here as white and the icon we are not going to change any of this so that is pretty much fine and we can go ahead and build again so hit build and let's go to the desktop here and let's make a new folder for this called pong web build and inside of this yeah we can select folder and it will start building so we'll just wait for it to finish awesome so now on our desktop we have a folder called pong web build and inside of this we again have two files one is the HTML file this stores all the information about how the unity Web Player is integrated into your browser so in here you can change how it looks what the title of the web player is all of that so if you have a program like notepad plus plus or any other other code editor you can go in and and change things around with this file and then we have the unity3d which basically stores all of the game information so this is the game itself and this what you would upload if you want to upload to a site like congregate and don't want to host it yourself so here comes again a bunch of information there basically three ways of getting your what days four ways of getting your Web Player out there so either you can build it like this and then maybe turn this into an RAR file and then upload it so people can download it and then they will have to just run both files but that would be stupid because then you can just use the normal standalone file so instead you want this somehow uploaded to the internet so that people can play it in their browser without downloading anything except the unity plugin and you can do that three ways you can do that either using Dropbox which is a pretty cool feature that I'm going to show you and that's what we are going to do in this video or if you have a website that you host yourself there are guides on the Internet it's not exactly easy there are often complications but there are plugins to help you and plenty of guides so just search embed unity Web Player game or something and there will be plenty of guides there and then lastly there is the alternative to just go to a site like congregate that will upload the game for you and you can also have ads on it or something I'm pretty sure but they will take a piece of the cake ban but yeah they and then people can go there to their side and play your game so in that case you're just going to be needing the unity3d file in our case we're going to be needing both right now we can double click on this unity Web Player thing and if you have the plugin just select run now and it will load up and it works so now we are playing in the browser and that's already really awesome but what we will do is we will make sure to throw other people a link to this the problem right now is that you might be saying well it's on the internet it's in the browser it's not really if you give this link up here to anyone it's not going to work because this is just a file path to the local file on your system so what we're going to do instead of E is we're going to install Dropbox if you haven't already just go to Dropbox calm install it an account is free and you have I think it's 5 gigabytes it might only be 2 I can't remember you have a couple of gigs for free and it works really okay so we are going to go ahead and open up my Dropbox folder here once you have installed it of course and let's just find the folder called public in my case I've deleted it it should be there when you first install Dropbox but then you can just go ahead and say new folder and just make one just public there you go double click that and it's important that you do this inside the public folder and then simply drag our pong web build folder into this right click on it of course we're just going to wait for it to sync up and now it has with the check mark there right and now we're going to double click on that and then right click on the HTML file and we're going to say copy public link and that was basically it so now if we open up a browser here and paste in this link and you can do this to all your friends it will run the HTML file and you can say run now and the game will play from the Dropbox server and if you're wondering if that's going to be lag on the game itself it is not because the game is locally run so this is just a final turn ative if you don't want to go through all the hosting stuff it works and I think that Dropbox will keep on supporting this functionality hopefully so thanks for watching and that pretty much concludes this series so thank you very much for watching all the way to the end I hope you enjoyed it leave suggesting suggestions for what you want to do next many people have asked me whether or not the survival game tutorial series is completely scratched but it it's not I will continue with it at some point I have some things I want to do but there's just been so much and there's been much more demand for other tutorials so I don't know if that's what I'm going to continue with now we'll have to see I'm also working on some interesting stuff for the make a game tutorial I'm not going to tell you anything about it specifically because it's not totally planned out and I would love to do something like a 2d platformer tutorial at some point because I'm pretty much in love with the 2d tools so that's going to be interesting we have some GUI soon coming out from unity so that's going to be really awesome been looking forward to that for like yea years and I'm definitely going to do something on that and yeah unity 5 has been announced so all so much stuff there to cover so yeah it's going to be a busy time so thanks for watching this video and and the series in general hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video
