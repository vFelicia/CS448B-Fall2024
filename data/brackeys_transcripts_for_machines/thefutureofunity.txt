yes so GDC is over and man did it come with a lot of exciting news we were really fortunate to be part of the conference special thanks to unity for inviting us we really had a great time now during GDC we got to see previews of a bunch of upcoming unity features and a lot of them actually really surprised me so in this video we'll have a look at what's coming to unity in 2018 so things kicked off with the Unity keynote after the opening speech from John Riccitiello it went right into machine learning here we got to see a cool demo of how you can use machine learning to teach the AI in a racing game how to steer by simply getting a human to play the game which we can see on the left the AI will slowly pick up on how to navigate through the level as seen on the right normally you would have to program all this behavior by hand which is not only time consuming but often leads to very unnatural and robotic feeling AI next up we got a quick overview of the release scheduled for 2018 unit is planning three major releases which you can see here 2018 point one is mostly focused on artists and rendering capability as we've already seen with the announcement of shader graph and SRP according to unity they want to keep working on these two themes for the remaining year in 2018 point two we can expect to see a bunch of new features like a vector graphics importer 2d character animation as well as new asset bundle tools and it was already at this point in the presentation that I fell off my chair never ever had I thought this would happen it felt like my entire life had been leading up to this moment let me give you a hint that's right it's finally here ready three two one all right that's that's not it but we have nested prefabs now to those of you who aren't in on the joke unity has been promising nested prefabs for a really long time without getting into too much detail nested prefabs really expand on the usefulness of prefabs by allowing us to parent prefabs to each other we'll definitely make a video on this once we know more from here they went on to talk about the new rendering features most of this had already been announced but still they showed some really impressive stuff from the Book of the Dead demo using the HD render pipeline mostly what caught my eye was support for really high in rendering features like subsurface scattering real time area lights and volumetric sky occlusion and the most insane thing was that everything was running on a Playstation 4 Pro pretty crazy the presentation then moved on to a tiny demo of shader graph and finally yo Keem jumped on stage to talk a bit about performance and the future of programming in unity most importantly he announced that the entity component system is now available in preview which is definitely exciting and at this point I thought well that was it the keynote got wrapped up everybody went home but just the morning after there was a talk on the Unity 2018 roadmap and holy Wow did they announce a lot of new features first of all Andrew showed off some demo footage of the 2d character animation and support for vector graphics he also talked about sprite shape which is a new tool for creating spline based layouts and levels in 2d he then went on to text mesh Pro which will be more tightly integrated with the editor timeline is getting some tools for faster editing cinema Sheen is getting a storyboard feature to quickly test out ideas by overlaying references and sketches and just as I thought he was running out of stuff BAM new node based video effects editor now we don't know a lot about this yet but I'm just really excited about this one and finally the terrain system is also getting an update again we don't know much yet but apparently it's getting a UI overhaul with better brush painting as well as a performance boost something that is definitely needed this point also to those of you who don't know unity is working on a new launcher called unity hub it's currently available in preview and will definitely be a nice addition especially to those who are working with multiple versions of unity and that's pretty much all we had to cover for this video I would love to hear what feature you guys the most excited about for 2018 on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to have the awesome patreon supporters who donated in March and a special thanks to Patrick McKinley Diego infinity PBR yo Ryoma Sybok mami dark Eames Kirk novel fizzle Merrifield Bureau die DoubleTap 45g snyder james peihgee delay superman the great John Burkhart Coco Braille Dennis Sullivan Jason plant said Alex Akatsuki Bruins cat free on fukken ops wetlands Sweden of Matthew Knight Jin Sasha hop Steinberger appears James Watchers Robert pond kudamon Rob Ferren Adrienne has slinger and Erasmus you guys Rock
