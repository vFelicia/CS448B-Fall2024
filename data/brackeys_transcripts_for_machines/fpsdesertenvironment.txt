hello one man oh man do I have something exciting to show you guys today here's the brandnew desert environment by Sam truck all the mounts are PBR and highly detailed so you can easily use it in your first person or third person game the pack is now available at dev assets calm as with everything else on the side it's pay what you want everything you see on the screen now is rendered in unity in real time using only the example thing that you get when you download it we've been working crazy hard on this tax time has put in countless hours in each and every one of these models so we hope that you guys will support the project if you want you can grab the pack from the link in the description right away but here's the sure to turn on how to get everything working in unity in case you're in doubt so to get started open up your browser go to dev assets comm click on the FPS environment here you can check out the screenshots and read a bit about it and when you're ready simply select the price and hit the blue button it's going to download as a zip file and when you unzip it you should get this folder inside that we have the models folder which contains all the individual FBX models as well as textures in case you're using unity I recommend your double clicking on the desert environment unity package this is going to set up and import everything including an example scene into Yanagi so you can check out all the elements that makes this pack it does include a few things from the standard assets folder so if you don't have that already it's going to import it let's hit input and you can see it created a desert environment folder inside this we have some stuff for the example seen all of our models neatly categorized and most importantly a prefabs folder which contains all these different props and models with material textures and colliders already set up I'm just going to go ahead and open the example scene here and right away we get this beautiful looking scene and if we go ahead and hit play we can see all the different moving parts in our scene we have a nice moving camera script we have the leaves of the trees here blowing in the wind we have some lights particle effects both for the fire and for the dust blowing by if we dump into the scene view here we can have a closer look at all of the different models again if you want to add a particular model to your scenes when you go into the desert environment go to prefabs find them all you want in my case I'm just going to take the generator here and simply drag it into the scene you can see that because we're using a PBR workflow everything is just going to blend right out the gate because everything is so detailed and set up to scale we should be able to just import a firstperson controller I'm just going to go import package and then characters we can instantly go under the characters folder go on the first person character and drag one of these prefabs in I'm just going to take the rigidbody FPS controller here drag it in I'm also going to just move them up and rotate them a bit then replace the current camera with our main camera from this scene because this already has some nicelooking settings so just delete the old one make sure to reference the new one and on our camera I'm just going to disable depth of field we'll also just reset the transform of our camera and move it up say 0.6 and finally I'm just going to set our field of view to something like 60 and when we now hit play we should be able to move around the scene you can see some of the objects even have rigid bodies on them pretty cool right that was pretty much it for this video I hope you enjoyed the pack now it's time for Sam and I to catch up on some lastly thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to of the awesome people who donated in January and a special thanks to Derek since Kirk Chaisson verify James Callaghan Robert Bonham Peter Locke and Jason doe teedoe if you want to become a patron yourself you can do so a patron become slash brekkie thanks a lot guys
