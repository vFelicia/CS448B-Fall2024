guys I finally did it I managed not to miss out on a game jam that's right the second practice game jam just got wrapped up and the review process has now started we got three hundred and thirty three entries which is not only amazing he's also apparently an ancient number so if that excites you yay anyway the Gulf of the gem was to make a game from scratch in only one week the theme was love is blind which the admins from the firm was so kind as to hide for me until it got announced which meant that I got to experience the usual emotional roller coaster of ooh that's really cool wait a minute I have no idea what to make with that I've never get another idea in my life again ooh that might work let's do this so my first thought when hearing the theme was that's a really good Jack White song the next thought was to make a puzzle platformer yes that was literally how it went so far most of my jam games have been score based the kind of games where you start over and over again in an effort to do better however for this game I really wanted to try my luck with something different so I went with a more level based structure this of course meant that I had to delve into the vast and daunting world of level design the basic idea of the game was this two players must collaborate to make it to that date because the player characters are in love they are blind to everything the other player touches the two players need to both work around this and use it as an advantage to help each other succeed and with that it was time to get cracking but first this video is sponsored by Jason Wyman he's the creator of the amazing unity3d masterclass which takes you all the way from the very fundamentals of game dev to using unity on a professional level it will teach you the principles of solid code architecture and how to build a variety of game types on top of that you will also get familiar with packages like cinema Sheen timeline and pro builder what makes this course unique is that you get to work along with other students and get live oneonone help from Jason himself he also has an amazing VR course that will teach you how to work with VR and even make a game and then you will have made multiple finished games and have the opportunity to customize and show off your unique work to the class if you sign up now the first 50 people will get a free brackish shirt as well as a big discount and other bonuses on both courses simply click the link in the description and get started so the first day was all about getting the core gameplay in place by writing up a duck with a list of ideas for stuff I wanted in the game and sketched out a quick example level to help visualize them once I felt I had a good idea of where to start I jumped right into player movement which in this case was fairly simple I also made good use of the 2d platform component to allow players to jump on top of platforms from underneath of course the game needed to play characters so I created the second player using a variant prefab that override it controls and graphics and after just about an hour the players were moving around the screen next I created platforms that would register when a player collided with them and change color based on the player of course a really central part of the game is that players move through colliders of the opposite color to achieve this I used the addition matrix to choose certain layers that wouldn't collide with each other and assign these layers through script I then created an end goal that triggers a level change when both players are standing on the platform I also made the level restart when a player falls down and with that I actually kind of had a game it wasn't very pretty yet but the core mechanics were there I also realized that all of my levels would be sharing a lot of the same objects stuff like the main environment game managers and the camera should remain the same so I decided to make use of unities new ability to combine together multiple scenes and split the game into a base scene with all the stuff that wouldn't change and then a scene for each level containing all the level specific elements like platforms also created a quick script that would load and unload level scenes during the game and I was surprised to see that with very little effort the system worked really well and it made it so much easier when I later had to go in and update graphics at the end of the day I introduced a new gameplay element vertical lockers these forced the players to start thinking about how they can help each other pass through otherwise blocked off passages I followed that up with a bit of play testing courtesy of Andreas and Thea and that was pretty much it for day one now if we take some graphics add a bit of graphics and then order some more graphics on top of that that pretty much sums up day two I started by seeking out some nice reference images that fit the style I was going for I wanted something cozy like a tavern or restaurant I found this amazing artwork from the game monster sanctuary that I just fell in love with and perhaps copied a bit and actually I think this is an important point to make I'm not a very artist and if there's one thing I've learned it's that it's very important not to be afraid of covering bits and pieces of artwork you like especially when learning I found that it's a great way to improve my skills by trying out new techniques but still having a reference to help guide in the right direction of course I always encourage you to put a spin on it and think of ways to make your work stand out in this case for example I wanted to move away from the traditional fad pixel art style and decided to make everything react to lighting in unity I wrote up a quick sprite shader that allowed me to input a normal map and generated normal maps for the environment in Photoshop using this guide I found online I also created some sprites for the players I really wanted the character is to feel squishy and despite my terrible animation skills I feel like that fairly well now the graphics were continued on day three I created sprites for the different platforms and a small romantic dinner table I also took advantage of the dynamic lighting and added a candlelight that were flicker slightly to give a bit of life to the scene and then made the platforms glow when changing color which I think really helped tie everything together and make the levels more vibrant as the players progressed through them and talking about levels at this point it was time to start introducing new puzzle elements into the game I did this using a very simple threepart design philosophy one introduced mechanic to explore mechanic and three challenge a good example of this is the timed color changer this platform will alternate between the two colors on a fixed timer the first level to introduce this is super simple both players need to time that jumps to make it across at this point the players are familiar with how the mechanic works and the first step is complete next we explore in the mechanic here we see that multiple platforms can change color at the same time this level is harder and forces the players to start testing out their knowledge of the mechanic to solve it finally we challenge the players in this case it's done by offsetting the timer on the platforms so that the players have to be really accurate with their jumps the players also have to switch positions which makes it easier to get confused but no matter how good a design philosophy you might think you have you must never underestimate the importance of play testing whenever I asked the an andreas hub how they always managed to figure out weird loopholes that I would have never discovered on my own finally I created some more site variations for the platforms and that was pretty much the end of day three day four it was the final day I had to work on the project because of this I jump straight into level design added buttons that would change the color of platforms while standing on them and using the same design philosophy I created three levels based on this concept at this point the game needed quite a bit of Polish so I created a Start screen that would introduce the characters and goal of the game as well as a quick victory screen to reward players who complete all the levels also created an animation for finishing a level added a quick splash screen and with that the game was complete we threw together a very quick celebration and I submitted the game to the gem and I must say I'm really glad with how this one turned out especially because there are so many ways you can expand on the game by just adding more interesting levels if you want to play the game well of course have a link for that in the description and while you're at it make sure to check out and review all the other amazing entries we're planning to do a
