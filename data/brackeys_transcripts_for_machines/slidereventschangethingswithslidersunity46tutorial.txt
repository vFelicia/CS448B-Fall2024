thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to the third video covering the allnew unity gy system introduced with unity 4.6 so Unity 4.6 is still in a public beta so to download it please just head over to unity3 do3d.com and you can download it there also if you have any questions throughout this video please just visit forum. bra.com and ask a question here uh I among many other developers are just waiting to to answer your questions cool so the topic of today's video is just going to expand a a bit on what we did last so the last video was pretty short and uh I hopefully this one is going to be to um we took a look at uh making our buttons actually do something whenever we press them and today we're simply going to do the same but with sliders so how we can set up sliders to interact with our gameplay elements so as always I've opened up unity and I've created a very basic scene here we simply have a a main camera with a background then we have a a cube just a simple standard Unity Cube and then we have a uh button which we set up in the last video and now I've also created a slider and I've basically just let the slider be as is I've just scaled it a bit and changed the uh the color of some of the elements just to make it fit but other than that it's completely um uh from fresh I mean nothing has changed here so what we're going to do is on my Cube I've created a script called rotate Cube and it has a public variable called speed which is currently set to 30 so when we press play right now you can see that this Cube rotates around the y axis and uh if we go ahead and and double click on the rotate Cube script here to inspect it I can uh show you just how simple this functionality actually is so I've created a public float called speed and I've just defaulted it to 10 I've set it to 30 in the inspector then inside of the update function I simply Ed the transform. rotate to rotate it around its local Y axis dependent on the speed and then I multiply with time. Delta time so that it's not going to be frame rate dependent but what we are going to do is we're going to make our slider control the speed that it uh that it um rotates with so in order to do this we're going to make a public void so a public function that doesn't return anything and let's call this adjust speed and this is going to take a some just a single argument and we just going to call this um let let's see this is already speed so let's just call this new speed and make sure to uh set this as a type of float so we're going to make a float called new speed and then we're simply going to open up the function here and inside of this we're simply going to set our speed variable to be equal to new speed and that's all we have to do inside of our script so simply save this now we can head into the canvas we can select our slider we can go down here to the on value changed single you can see that the list is currently empty so let's hit the plus sign let's select the object so I'm just going to find the cube there it is so once we've selected our Cube we can go ahead and select a function on that Cube and you will notice that it has both a game object uh category the trans transform component has a bunch of things so does the mes filter the Box col and the mesh renderer but it also has our newly created script called rotate Cube and once we dig under this you can see that it has some different static par parameters that we can uh change but it also has a dynamic float called adjust speed so once we select this it's actually going to work just like that now it's it's going to input the uh value of the slider into this new speed variable and then it's going to set the speed to that new float so uh if we hit play right now you will see that this is working but it's rotating extremely slowly it's simply going between zero and one and that's not really something we want so in order to change this let's set the max value to maybe 200 just for fun and the minimum value we're just going to keep that as at zero but right now our default value is set to one so in order to change this we're just going to use the slider to change our default value and I'm just going to default this to 30 as I did before so now when we hit play you can see that it rotates as before but we can now control the speed that it rotates with you using this slider and that's super fun so uh you could of course also go 200 here if you wanted it to rotate in the opposite direction uh you can see that our slider changes accordingly and now we can rotate in both directions so that's the basics of editing scripts uh or editing values based on a normal UI slider it's simply that easy and in here we can of course do all kinds of different stuff we can change the color of objects we can change the loudness of Music whatever you want to do simply using this basic formul with a public function a name you input a float take a float as an argument and then you do something based on that float so that was basically it for this video I actually managed to keep it pretty short so that's a a record almost so thanks for watching today's video and I'll see you in the next one oh
