thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to video number seven in going to Dee today we are going to be taking a look at adding some audio to your game we're also going to do a few other things here's the list for today first off we are going to delve into physic iterations with just just a quick fix to make the collisions in our game a bit more accurate the next up we are going to add some sound effects and some backing background music and then at last and this is only if we have time we're going to add a reset and a quit button so cool that's the format for today so as always I've opened up unity here and if we go under edit project settings and then physics 2d you can see that I have bumped up the velocity and the position iteration so normally these are at 8 and 3 and they basically mean how accurately the computer is going to calculate collision between objects and what we want is we want to bump this up a bit because we only have a single rigidbody object in our scene and so the calculations that the computer is going to be doing are not that hard so we might as well make them very accurate and this number is of course going to depend on the platform you're publishing to because physics calculations can be harsh on the CPU which is the processor but again we only have one single rigid body element in the scene so I think we're going to be fine so I'm just going to bump the velocity iteration up to 15 and the position position iterations up to 10 cool next up on our list is the sound effects so if you go ahead if you go to brackish comm you can download the 2d assets pack under the unity 2d course here and inside of this I've included some cool and effects and some music that you're free to add to your game also commercially it's completely royaltyfree so if we go under the 2d assets pack here under the audio folder you can see we have a bunch of different things and let me just preview this I'm just going to bump down the volume a bit and let's start up with the background music and I've made sure that the background music will loop pretty nicely and seamlessly without weird clicking also we have a bonus song which which is great for pickups we have a click which is pretty subtle so it's something we're going to use whenever the ball hits our players we have a game over if you want to add a game over sound game over I've made that one myself and then we have a hit which is a little more violent so yeah feel free to use this however you want first off let's do the clicking so let's drag the click audio clip inside of unity here and simply release maybe let's make a folder for this so let's make a folder called audio and drag the click audio inside of that so double click it and in here select the click audio and we're going to change the 3d sound to false here so we're just going to disable that because this is a 2d game and we don't want the sound to be relative to the position from the sword or from the listener to the source we just wanted to be there simply so I just disable that and everything else here we can just leave we can make this native and not compress it because it's such a short sound so it's okay that it's really nice quality and and and therefore also a large size so let's hit apply and cool so now let's go ahead and program the functionality that will play this so if we go ahead and find our ball here we can okay so we can do a few things here we can place the script on the ball or on the players because we're going to be detecting whenever the ball hits the player so first off we can open up our ball control script simply doubleclicking to open it up in monodevelop and just wait for it to open up probably probably here hmm monodevelop is acting a bit weird I think I'll just close it down and start it up again might need to pause the video here because I think monodevelop I stopped working here let's try this again so open up the ball control script and yeah this looks better cool so now it's working so let me zoom in on the text here and we can see that in here we have an on collision enter where the ball checks if we hit a player and then we add some velocity and this is the on collision enter which means that it will only be called once and this is really great for playing audio so we might as well add our audio here so now we can simply go in here and say audio dot play an inside of these parentheses you can input a name of the audio but because we're only going to have one audio sitting on our one audio source on our Bowl we can simply just leave it empty so now let's save this and hit back into unity and now we can make some audio for the script to play so now let's hit add component audio audio source inside of the audio source we're going to select the clip which is going to be the click then we're going to disable play on awake and make sure that loop is also disabled and just to make sure that this won't be too loud let's just drag it to something like 0.8 it's a great thing to mix everything not too loudly because if you have a player that opens up the game and everything just blows him away chances he's just going to mute it and that's not what you want you want him to be enjoying the audio that you made so just make sure that it's not too loud and then maybe add an option for volume control also you have better control over the maximum value or if your clip is pretty silent if everything is mixed down so just mix it down to start up with cool let's now hit play and see how the sounds we can hear the clicking sound playing whenever the ball hits a player great so that's exactly what we want now whenever it comes to a clip that is played as much as this one I mean it's almost played constantly it can quickly get annoying so here's a pretty cool tip for making it sound less repetitive right before the audio to play we do audio pitch and then we simply change the pitch using a random range so we are just going to change it with a random value so we do equals random range and then inside of this we can simply input to float numbers so something like and you can of course make these into variables up here um so you can change them inside of unity but I'm just going to hardcode them here so something like 0.8 this might be too much but it's good for demonstration purposes and then 1.2 F and then close it off and add a semicolon so now every time right before the audio plays it's going to randomize the pitch a bit and we can see the pitch value down here so when we hit play now we can see the pitch very and we can hear the small variations it's not much but it's enough that you will not get so annoyed by the sound constantly playing awesome so the next thing to do here is add the next sound effect so we could do something with the bonus let's let's add this whenever a player scores if you have made some AI so that the player is playing against an opponent you could add this sound when the player scores and this sound when the when the AR scores but we're not going to go into that so let's drag our bonus clip under the audio folder inside of unity let's go in here disable 3d sound leave it native and simply hit apply now we can go in here and let's see where this would be good to place so we have our ball here and our ball control script and it inside of this we called the reset ball function so it might be good to play using this I mean we also have let's see so we have the on collision you have the go ball that's not any of what we want so we might I mean it's easiest if you can just spread the different audio sources over a few different objects that way you don't have to switch out audio clips using variables that what that's what you normally do if you need to play multiple clips on one object but just to simplify things I would like this to sit on another object so maybe in here where we detect whether or not something is head so here with the side walls inside of this script we could add something yeah let's let's actually go ahead and do that so inside of this if hitting info dot name is equal to ball it sends out the reset ball and it scores and all that let's play the audio in here so let's simply do right before game manager that score we're just going to do audio dud play and you can add the pitch randomization here also it's not played as much so I'm just going to leave it because I'm lazy but feel free to do it then under then simply select the left and the right wall hit add component audio audio source to add it to them both make sure to disable play on your wake bump down the volume a bit and then under the audio clip we can just select the bonus here and yeah these settings have applied to both the walls and let's hear how this sounds that's just perfect close so now we also have a scoring sound that's basically all the sound effects that I feel like we need you can also add something for every time the ball collides and you can do that just using a normal on collision enter and then switching out the source down here but again that's not something we're going to go into this is a pretty simple game and audio was not the primary theme for this for this series so next thing on our list is the music so let's add some background music to our game so to add background music here let's just first off drag it into unity so drag it onto the audio folder and this is going to take a little while to import whenever it comes to optimizing your game in terms of storage so that it won't be too large for uploading audio is really something you need to go after you because all you really quickly gets really large in file size so watch out with long clips this is actually pretty long it of course depends on the platform it would be line four a PC downloadable but if this is going to be a mobile game I would say that this track is a bit too long also make sure that you do this in a compressed format whenever the clip is so long this one is mp3 which is already compressed so let's disable the 3d sound here and let's match the compression with what I've made so that's two hundred and twenty eight so simply hit apply and actually let's also make this stream from disk which is a great thing to do when it comes to music now let's hit apply and it's going to reemployed everything again so all of the these sounds I've included in the pack are already optimized for for game making but just make sure you don't just download a song and put it in there it will be too large in the end awesome so let's now add this to the game and we can just add this to the GM object I think that would be pretty well relevant so sick select the GM object go to audio audio source and add the clip background music hit play on awake and set loop to true and then just bump down the volume a lot because background music doesn't need to be too loud so that's here now I actually think that's pretty awesome so that's just going to keep on playing and once it's finished it's going to loop and it's gonna sound nicely so that was it for the audio part of this video I think we're gonna go ahead and save the GUI for another video umm but yeah so that was basically it for this one thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
