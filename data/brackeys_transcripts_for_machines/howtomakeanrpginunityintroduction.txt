making an RPG in unity might seem like a pretty big challenge I produce often both system and content heavy however in this series we will try to boil it down to a few key subjects that are central for almost any RPG and to keep things simple we've split the videos up into two categories gameplay and graphics I'll be handing the gameplay side here we'll learn how to create stuff like player and camera movement interactable x' and items an inventory system equipment character stats enemy AI and combat but the graphics side of things I've teamed up with Sebastian lake with a fellow tutorial creator hello I'll be sharing how to model break and animate a simple character in blender complete with a basic set of armor and a weapon I'll also be showing how to take these graphical elements and integrate them with the gameplay so in these integration episodes we'll be writing code to trigger the correct animations as well as to interface with Becky's equipment system to have the equipment graphics actually show up on the character and animate correctly along with them now since some of you may be interested exclusively in the coding side of things or others perhaps exclusively in the graphics the series will be split into two separate playlists gameplay and graphics the gameplay playlist will contain all of Becky's coding videos as well as my videos on integrating the graphics with the code while the graphics playlist will just contain my blender videos make sure to subscribe to Sebastian's channel so you don't miss a video in this series the first video on gameplay will be up on my channel this Wednesday so stay tuned until then Sebastian has a bunch of other games and videos you can check out I'm super excited to get cracking on the game if you want you can download the environment we'll be using from dev assets the pack will be updated as we go also in case you get stuck we've made the source code available on github there will be a link for both in the description on that thanks for watching I will see you in the next video thanks to all the awesome patreon supporters who donated in June and a special thanks to hands often yes by McKesson we'll code Thomas Wally stone gamer Sybok mommy Jason the pedo Deric Hughes kirk and face of Merrifield if you want to become a picture in yourself you can do so at patreon.com slash practice
