if you want to learn blender this is the place to start in these videos we'll go over the basics of using blender from modeling to texturing to Lighting in this video we set up the interface learn to navigate around and create our first objects and by the end we make a monkey explode yeah welcome to 3D modeling all right so let's get into it so to download blender let's go to blender.org I'll have a link in the description as well that said download choose an operating system and choose a location closest to you in my case that's Denmark it's going to start downloading once it's done just open it up and run through the installer so let's open up blender the version that I'm using is 2.78 C but I don't expect the stuff will cover here to change anytime soon let's get rid of this opening window by clicking anywhere in the screen and welcome to blender not a lot of people find the interface to be really daunting at first don't worry as a beginner you won't be using 90% of the stuff you see here the primary thing that we're going to be focusing on is the 3D viewport that's the big one in the center here this is where we do all of our modeling where we change around objects and select them that means that this is where most of the creative stuff happens on the right here we have the properties panel this this is probably also the most scary one you'll notice just how many knobs and dials there are here this is used to modify things in our scene and some of the tabs modify the object that is currently selected in our case we have the cube selected so if we were to go to the materials panel and change the color of the material to let's say green we can see that that modifies our Cube but if we then select our camera we can see that the materials tab is gone because our camera does not have a material now let's undo that by hitting contrl z a couple times and some of you might have had a hard time selecting the camera here maybe this happened that's because blender is a bit different and doesn't use left click to select instead we use right click and left click just moves around our 3D cursor the 3D cursor is used for a few things mainly it's the place where we spawn new objects and it can be pretty annoying if you accidentally click somewhere and now everything you spawn is out here so to reset that you can always hit shift C and it's going to snap right back to the center of our scene now before we start changing things around let's go file use a preference and this is where we configure blender you will see a lot of people using a different theme if you go into themes and presets there are a bunch of different ones to choose from a very popular one is elisan but we'll just be using the default theme on the input we can adjust all of our keyboard shortcuts of which there are many by default you can leave everything as is but if you're using a keyboard without a number pad maybe on the laptop without one the number pad is the numbers to the right of your keyboard you will probably want to go ahead and check emulate numpad that's because we use the number pad a lot in blender when adjusting our view and checking this will allow you to use your normal number Keys instead also if you're really annoyed with having to right click to select you can change that preference here so now that we're satisfied with our settings let's hit save user settings to make sure that they will be there next time we open blender so let's have a look at how we can navigate around our view there are three main ways to move around in blender the first one is using our scroll wheel this will zoom in and out if you hold down the middle Mouse button and drag it will rotate around a certain Pivot Point this allows us to view our object from multiple sides and if we hold down shift and middle Mouse button we can pan around a scene so using these three different ways of movement we can quickly focus on different objects and if you quickly want to snap to a certain object you can always select it and hit period on the number pad to snap to it in fact if you get so lost that you can't even see your objects you can always go up here this is called the outliner and it shows all of the objects currently in our scene we can then click the object that we want to snap to and hit period and there we go the outliner can be really handy for selecting objects you can't see or hide objects that you don't want to focus on we can also use the number pad to quickly view our scene from different sides if we had seven we view it from above three from the side and one from the front however if we go ahead and pan to the side here you can see that we're still viewing things in perspective and this is sometimes a good thing but other times we actually just want to view things flat in the same way that an architect would draw out different sides of a building to do that we hit five this changes us into orthographic mode and it basically just removes perspective from our scene so now everything is going to be viewed flat and we can still view it from above the side and the front and we can even drag around here and still view things in autographic mode you can see up here which mode we're currently in if we hit five again we switch back to perspective this can of course be a bit confusing to the mind when you first get started but you'll quickly get used to switching between them and find out just how handy it is to be able to do that so now that we know how to navigate around our scene let's start doing things let's begin by selecting the camera holding down shift to select the light as well let's hit delete or X to remove it let's select our Cube and the first thing that we can do here is use the arrow keys to move it around our scene and E way to do this is simply hitting G for grab and we can now drag it around when dragging things in freehand like this it can be hard to get a grasp of where your object currently is in space so instead of really moving it it's normal to have it snap to a certain axis we can hit X to only move it around the xaxis Z to move it along the zaxis and Y to move it along the Y if we left click we go through with the move movement but if we right click it snaps back other than moving our object we can also rotate it to do that we hit R again we can rotate it in freehand or around the x z and y AIS and finally we can hit s to scale by default we scale on all axis around the center you've guessed it we can also choose to only scale on the X the Z and the Y so we can now manipulate objects the way that we want and so we can start building cool stuff if for example we were to delete this Cube hit shift a to bring up a menu this menu allows us to spawn objects into a scene there's a lot of different stuff here but what we are going to be working with is everything underneath the mesh Tab and these are basic Primitives that you can work off of let's begin by spawning in a cube here let's scale it down on the zaxis let's grab it and move it up on the zaxis as well let's then hit shift a and let's spawn in a cylinder let's scale this down quite a bit but scale it up on the zaxis we can then hit seven to view this from the top to get a better view we go down here this allows us to change from solid to wireframe mode and we can now see the cylinder through the cube we then hit grab to move it and let's move it to the edge here to duplicate an object we hit shift d and we can move this over to the right as well let's now select both of them by holding down shift and right clicking and let's duplicate both and move those down to the bottom if we now shift back into solid mode hit five to switch back to perspective we've created a table now there are about a million different things that we could do to make this cooler but you have to start somewhere and congratulations on your first model if the banding on the cylinders here is really annoying you you can select all of them and go up here and change the shading to smooth that should help sort that out if we now were to select all the objects and remove them and instead go ahead and add a monkey the monkey head here is blender history it's been there for so many years and it's been used for pretty much everything it's been blown up shattered and put into environments of All Sorts so you'll probably be seeing a lot of this guy let's just do something fun and go ahead and make him shatter to do that we hit space to bring up our search menu and this is a really cool part of blender if there's something that you don't remember the shortcut to or can't find in the menus or maybe you just get an idea of something that you want to do but don't know how try searching for it for example if we wanted to add a sphere we search for add sphere and you get options for the different spheres you can add if we hit add Uvis sphere boom there's a sphere in our scene but now we want to make this guy explode let's go in here and write explode that's an option called quick explode if now we go down here and hit play we can see him shattering this here is the animation window and you can scrub through to any point in time we won't be using this too much but it's cool to know about so I really encourage you to take what you've learned here and go completely nuts with it don't be afraid to change around dials and adjust knobs you can also mess around with the interface all that you want if you feel you get completely lost don't worry all you need to do to restore your settings is go back to file new and voila everything gets reset that's properties interface and everything you've done with your scene so go nuts and save often that's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe so you don't miss the next one I upload Sundays and Wednesdays also this is of course a bit different from my usual video normally I do tutorials on game development most of them on using my favorite piece of software which is Unity so if you're interested in game development I have a course here for complete beginners on to my loyal subscribers don't worry I'll still be doing plenty of unity tutorials other than that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to all the awesome Patron supporters who donated in April and a
