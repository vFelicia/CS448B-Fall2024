since the launch of unity's UI features in 4.6 one area that has really been lagging is text luckily one of my favorite editor extensions text mesh pro has now been acquired by unity and so we should see this slowly be made of the unity standard editor until then text mesh Pro is available for free on the asset store and if you haven't picked it up yet well you're really missing out the asset uses say technique called sign distance field to make your text render so much crisper it also has a bunch of tools for layouting your text and lots of cool buttons for styling it so in this video we'll just dive in and start using some of these features let's get into it the most important part for me is how crisp the text renders here we see a comparison between the standard text and unity and a text mesh Pro text object I hope this is clear from the recording but even at this distance there's a huge difference and if we now go to the scene View and start zooming in the difference becomes so much clearer in fact we can keep zooming in on the text mesh Pro object and it will remain crisp well if we do this on Unity standard text not so much so to get text mesh Pro we want to go window asset store and then search for text mesh Pro you can just use the link in the description we'll then import it for free let's hit import again and that's it now we're ready to get started creating text in text mesh Pro works in the same way that it normally does we'll simply right click in the hierarchy go UI and instead of choosing text we'll choose text mesh Pro text as you can see this creates a canvas and our text mesh Pro object and we can configure it in the inspector we can choose the text itself we can also scale up our box here and choose how it should be layouted in it we can choose a font by changing the font asset you should get a few ones by default we can choose some styling options and if you go to material preset there are some premade styles to choose from but before we delve into styling let's have a look at importing our own fonts to do that we first want to find a font I'm just going to search for robotto this is on Google fonts I'm going to select this font I'm then going to take the font family and download it finally you can open this up in a zip file make sure to extract the zip file and let's now take robot regular.ttf and simply drag it into the unity project now this is a regular font and so this is not going to render in the crisp way that text mesh Pro does to make this usable for text mesh Pro we go window text smash Pro and we open up the font as a Creator this allows us to take a regular font we'll take in our newly imported font and drag it into the font sour slot and turn it into a font Adas using sign distance field in most cases you can leave all the settings as is and hit generate font Atlas and it should look something like this now we can hit save textmesh Pro font asset you can choose a location in your project and I'm just going to call it robot. asset let's now hit save we can close down the fond asset Creator and boom we now have a font asset we then select our text mesh Pro object drag in our new font asset and there we go we've now changed the font of our text now if we scroll down in the inspector we can see all of the different knots and dials that will allow us to style text in most cases however you just want fairly simple text controls and we don't want to spend performance and all these options that we won't use so we go to Shader and change this to text mesh Pro mobile and then distance field this only has options for the face outline and an underlay such as a shadow so to add a shadow to a text we enable our underlay let's open up the settings let's offset it on the X and Y and let's add some softness and there we go we've now created white text with a black shadow but that's so much more we can do if you go on the text mesh Pro folder on examples then scenes there are almost 30 different scenes here showing different aspects of text mesh Pro I really recommend going through all of these each feature can be super useful let's try open up number 25 the text mesh Pro title and I'll just hit don't save now you can see some text working with lighting if we go ahead and disable one of the lights our text will update let's select the two text objects here and disable them and let's let create one on our own by right clicking going 3D object and selecting text mesh Pro text let's then find it in the scene view let's drag it up a bit and let's change the font asset to our robotto text however this styling is super boring but instead of overwriting our current style let's go ahead and create a new one this option can be a bit hard to find but what we need to do is actually right click on our material down here hit create material preset this is going to take us to the place where our font asset is stored and create a material right by the side of it the default material the first one we're using right now can be found under the fond asset itself so let's name our new material robotto let's call it coal let's then select our text object make sure our robotto coal material is selected and let's switch out of this mobile Shader to text mesh Pro and let's do distance field surface now you can see that the lighting our scene is already affecting our text so if we change the lighting our text will change with it let's make our text bold let's give it a bit more room let's Center it in our text box make sure to move it over to center it in our game view let's also add some spacing between the characters let's scroll down for our face let's dilate the text a bit and here we can of course choose a color but we can also put a texture so that's hit select and when importing text mesh Pro it's also going to import some materials I'm going to take the floor cement and I'm also going to add some gloss this is not going to change however before we go down here and on the lighting increase our specular color and now you can see that we're adding in gloss on our text let's then create an outline to do that we'll increase the thickness let's add some gloss here as well let's select a white color and we have the option to add a texture here as well for this one I'm going to select the fruit jelly and we can maybe tint this a bit let's say orange or maybe a bluish tone now we can adjust a bevel we can play around with the offset with the width the amount and we can even kind of round it out let's also add a bump map to our text under the texture here let's select sand normal and let's make this really apparent on the face and also give it a tiny bit on the outline finally there are options for adding environment Maps if you want Reflections and even glow to your text I think I'm going to add an RNG glow now this does not look good but I'm sure that's more the artist than the toll from here on I recommend you check out some of the example scenes if you get lost on your particular setting there's also the user guide and in the description you will also see a link to a YouTube channel by the guy who made this asset there's a lot of indepth information there so really there's no excuse to not have fun with this that's pretty much it for this video If you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe so you don't miss a future one so
