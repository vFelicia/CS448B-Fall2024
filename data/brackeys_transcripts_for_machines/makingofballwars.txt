so the last student I read was in July and it looked super fun personally I was bummed to find out that I couldn't participate after a few days of moping I decided enough is enough and I would simply take some time to make a game of my own for a long time I've been wanting to do something using controller input and we'd recently been playing a lot of Super Smash Bros for the Nintendo 64 inspired by this idea of multi character combat I started to sketch out a level I thought I should stay in the little diary mindset so I tried to keep everything as simple as possible I took the battlefield stage from the Wii U game and recreated it using basic shapes it wasn't pretty but I really wanted to move on to something more important movement and this is PI 5 the mechanic that I spend the most time on I had a few requirements I wanted the movement to be smooth but responsive I wanted a lot of movement on both the horizontal and the vertical axis and finally I needed the character movement to blend nicely with combat now if you ever tried creating physics based movement in unity you know that controlling a character using forces can quickly make it feel sloppy and unresponsive but I needed to use physics because I wanted to combat between players to be physics based the way I ended up solving this problem was by adjusting the amount of force applied to a player depending on the current velocity of the player in the given direction this means that if you press right and the character is already moving quickly in that direction it's not gonna apply that much force however if you then push left it's going to apply a great amount of force trying to shift the character in the new direction this approach was great because it gave me full control over these snappiness of the controls and I think they ended up feeling pretty good to give the place the feeling that they could move both horizontally and vertically I add a triple jump along with the ability to control the characters while in midair this is also the first time that I changed the level to fit better with the controls when the players are able to move this freely the level needs to give them space to do so so I made the platform smaller and increase the distance between them next I wanted movement to blend with combat I was really inspired by the way that Super Smash Bros handles damage basically the more you get hit the EC you are to knock off the level I really wanted to emphasize this mechanic but with more focus on ranged shooting so I equipped all the characters with weapons that shout out spheres when a player got hit by a sphere it would add a force depending on their current weakness level the weakness level would of course also increase over time as the card hit the only way to die in the game was to get shot off the platform I think this works really well because it feels like you're always in control if you get shot really hard you squeeze the joystick and do everything you can to time your jumps in an effort to make it back I also add a visual feedback on the current weakness level of the characters by scaling them up as they got weaker at this point the game was playable and I started testing it with my friends I quickly found out however that a lot of stuff still needed to be changed of course I needed to tweak some values like movement speed and damage but the main problem was the layout of the level but the level worked great in Super Smash Bros it played really poorly in my game I found that the big issue with the use of floating platforms my game was centered around shooting and the platform's would often get in the way this led to moments of in fairness where players would randomly get saved by the environment without even trying it also made it too hard to hit each other because you could simply hide on the other side of a platform so to fix this I completely removed all platforms and flattened out the level I also made it wider and added lots of holes that players could fall into at this point I started picturing the level with some actual art assets in it I decided to use the Mayan temple pack from Devas it's to make kind of an ancient underground arena in the middle of the arena I made a big full of lava where the players can fight to push each other in I like this idea in particular because well I really wanted to make lava I ended up using a free lava flowing shader from the asset store as a base and then added some particles and a bunch of postprocessing effects to help tie everything together when I was happy with the look of the game I once again asked my friends for feedback this time we played the game for a while and had a whole bunch of fun but the combat still needed more death so inspired by Simon's ability to charge her attacks I had to charge up to the spheres charging up an attack increased both the size damage and speed of the projectiles and help make combat much more interesting now each player had to decide in a given situation whether to fire quick short bursts or to charge up hoping for that one big hit I also added strategies for avoiding and blocking attacks I made it so if you hit all the players bullets they get destroyed and I'm also added knockback to the weapon so you could use a powerful attack as a way to stop yourself from falling in the lava at this point I was happy with how combat felt and I worked on polishing the game a bit I added a camera that would dynamically follow around and zoom in and out to fit all the players and I also added some effects for extra flare using the Unity particle path and that's pretty much where the game is in its current state I've experimented with adding powerups but I still need to add many more to make that viable of course they'll have a bunch of stuff that I'd like to do like add more detail to the level and add moving elements to make it more dynamic but overall I'm happy with what I did unfortunately it took away the pain of not participating in Londonderry at least some of it so that's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it maybe check out some of my other behind the scenes work on that thanks
