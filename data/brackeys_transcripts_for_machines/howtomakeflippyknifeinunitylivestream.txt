hello everyone welcome to this video this is a live stream recording on making a flipping knife replica inside of unity and what we're going to be making today is this so if I play here you can see that we have any physics enabled knife that we can kind of throw up into the air and try and Pierce this wooden blog with and oh I'm actually doing great that was three times in a row I believe four times guys are seeing okay four times is now the record we today we're just going to be focusing on making this game and then towards the end we'll do a Q&A session where you can ask questions and I'll answer them of course if you're watching on YouTube you can just see that happening but yet this is what we'll be making today so really fun simple game shouldn't take too long and let's just dive right into it so the first thing that we want to do is go ahead and create a new unity project so we'll go file new project and I'm going to call this um flippy woops flippy knife replica no just flippy knife and I'm gonna make it a 3d project and put it inside of my projects folder and unit is just going to boot up all these standard files here and we can wait okay I think this looks like success yes Saphir celebrating right over there yes alright thanks for tuning in and the livestream I had fun I hope you guys did as well as he okay so now that unit is working to this review on YouTube I placed a cut there hopefully I did and now things are working we had some technical issues on opening up unity the version we are using right now is 2017 point 2 which is the beta version but it should be out really soon and it really shouldn't be any problems I haven't had any so far so now we are inside of unity and we can get started so the first thing that I want to do here is just kind of sketch out the level and let's rightclick go 3d object and select a cube and this is going to be our wooden block so we can reset the transform on this we can call it wooden block and we can set the scale to something like 1 by 0.3 by 1 so just kind of a squished cube let's also take our camera and focus it on this block in fact I'm also going to kind of decrease the field of view I don't want to make this auto graphic but I definitely do want to have less field of view so let's put this at 30 kind of zooms everything in and we can just take our camera and drag it out further here so place it in the middle something along these lines maybe also kind of move it up or rotate it up and then move it down something like that looks pretty nice and I think that's pretty close to what we see in the game it's also duplicate a wooden block and let's rename this one to ground now of course we can drag this is down here so that our wooden block sits on top of our ground and we can extend this out on the X and Z so we can make this a 20 long and then on the Z here we'll put a 10 and it's actually only do a 5 and also kind of drag this back here so look something like this I know it's beautiful already kind of reminds me of Mass Effect just kidding so let's create a whoops I don't want to show anything in the Explorer here I want to create a material and this is going to be our ground material actually I'm gonna name it grass because we want this to be green and we can just decrease the smoothness change this to kind of a greenish color something along those lines and we can duplicate this material this one we'll call the wood material and we'll place that on top of the block again we don't again we want to change the color here to some kind of a wooden color and this is not going to be especially pretty but that will do then we go into our camera and instead of showing the skybox will show a solid color I'm just gonna call it picnic grass here and then make it a tiny bit darker so something along these lines so that is kind of the base of our level I'm just gonna save this fighting controllers or command s you're on a Mac and then let's just call it main for the main scene so if you're seeing this right now and see kind of thinking this doesn't look nearly as nice as what you showed before that's because what I had before had postprocessing effects and I'd use kind of some of the same techniques as in my how to get good graphics in unity video where we switch to linear rendering we switch to deferred rendering and we apply a bunch of postprocessing effects and with those steps you will make pretty much anything look a whole lot better and that that's what I did I had a vignette in there I had some motion blur some antialiasing all that good stuff I'm not gonna put that in here just yet but if everything goes well and we kind of wrap up the tutorial and you guys want to see we can't apply this towards the end of the tutorial so keep that in mind so I'm gonna save this now and it's time to add a knife and for this I went into blender and created a very simple knife model let's see if blender wants to start so I'm just gonna open this and really keep in mind here that I am probably the worst modeler alive this is what I came up with feel free to clap your hands plot I know it's it's super super super bad but it will work for now and we're going to be seeing it at a distance anyway I'm also just going to go into the materials here and change this from blue to a black because yeah that shouldn't be blue no that's only worries so something along these lines that we can always adjust it in unity so let me just say that and really all I did in order to create this was going add a cylinder and kind of play around with on the width of the cylinder and then after that I went in and added a cube and all I did was add a bunch of edge loops on the cube and then kind of play with the weight on those so really really simple to create the two parts of this knife so let's now take this knife oops to be temporary file and drag it into unity it's going to go ahead and import and the first thing that I want to do here is um this looks a bit different it has a materials tab now oh that's awesome oh that's so nice it's no longer gonna Clara the project panel with materials folders yes this is exactly what I wanted to see okay this a man we didn't get to put this in the video I hadn't noticed that's awesome okay so we are going to set the scale factor here to something like point zero four point zero three maybe even yeah let's do that let's just apply that and let's try and drag this into unity I hit F to focus on it and move it up a bit yeah and I think this is an appropriate size we might want it to be a tiny bit bigger let's try 0.35 hit apply on that yeah that's a bit bitter so and I think the materials here are looking just fine of course they're not beautiful but they will do for now we can maybe go in here and create a folder called materials and order the grass and wood will drag or will take the grass and wood and drag them under there and we can also create another material which we'll call the blade and we'll just drag this onto the blade here we can make this completely white and actually give this some smoothness just so we can get a bit of reflection at least in theory so yeah when you're satisfied with your knife really all you actually also want to go and kind of set the rig to none here so we don't get an animator sitting on on I fear now that's gone cool so when we you're satisfied with your knife model I definitely recommend creating an empty game object which has all the gameplay functionality for our knife and then keeping the graphics separate so let's just go in here and create right click on the knife hit create empty let's reset the transform on this let's drag it out so it's no longer parented to the knife that's called our knife here let's call that graphics and it's dragged that under our game object let's rename our game object to knife so now that these two are separated we can kind of orient them in any way that we'd like and the first thing that I would like to do here is set the knife rotation to zero and then on your graphics I want to rotate that by negative 90 on the X just to make sure that when it's pointing in this direction our rotation is zero zero zero I think that makes a lot of sense cool so now we can go into our knife here and add a few components the first thing that I want to add is a rigid body that's going here and create a rigid body and we can actually just leave all the settings as is the only thing that I want to do is make sure to constrain this rigid body on a few axes so we basically only wanted to rotate around the Z we only want to rotate it this way we don't want it to go flip in this direction or rotate around the y axis so we can go in and freeze rotation on x and y also we don't want it we only wanted to move on x and y we don't want it to move in depth using the z axis so we can also freeze the position on this Z so now we're sure that our knife will only move in the directions that we specify that's all good now we can add another component and this time we want to add a box Collider and this is by default going to be way too big so that's going here and decrease the size to add a note point one on the X might still be too big I'm just gonna switch to the side view here and then click on this Center to switch in to isometric view so we can kind of line this up nicer so I'm just going to decrease this and I'm gonna hold down alt while doing it to allow myself to do it with greater precision also going to do the same thing on the Y here we also want to move it up on the Y I'm really just try and adjust this as as good as you can and make sure to leave a good amount of room at the top I might even leave a tiny bit more because it helps us when we then need to TEKT whether or not we hit with the tip of our knife or with the shaft of our ninth so this looks good and then we just need to adjust the Z and we can bring this into something like point zero two point zero three maybe something like that looks pretty good so now we have at least an approximate Collider the next thing that we want is a script so let's go ahead and add a component and we're going to call this our knife script it's going to be C sharp and let's hit create an app let's double click it to open it up in Visual Studio this is where I'm going to take a sip of my cup of tea cool let me just check the chat here everything is going good awesome see instead of manually making the box collider why not just attach one to the model then copy it up to its parent you sir are genius yeah that would probably be a bit faster but I didn't want it to fit exactly with the model I wanted to leave a bit of room at the top so let's just say that's why cool so what do we want to do here the first thing that we want to do is get a reference to our rigid body so let's go up here and let's create a public rigid body and let's call it art B let's say that go into unity and let's make sure to reference this right away so now we have a field here where we can throw in our rigid body so now we can refer to our rigid body as our B inside of our script and the first and basically what we want to do here is check whether or not we press the mouse button if we do we want to see where we press the mouse button we then want to see when we release the mouse button button and where we do that and then we can subtract the two positions so the position of the mouse when we pressed and the position of the mouse when we released it and that will give us kind of the vector which means an arrow pointing from the start point to the end point of our mouse position and that means that we have an arrow pointing in the direction that we want to shoot our knife and the length of this arrow is going to be the amount of force that we're going to use to shoot so you could imagine that if we go in here and click say here on the screen and only drag up a little bit we definitely want the knife to shoot up but we want to use only very little force if we click again and drag much further this time we want the knife to to shoot up much further so with greater force and of course if you do this in the vert or in the horizontal direction we wanted to shoot well horizontally so to do this we'll go inside of update and the first thing that we need is to check what for when we press our mouse button so input that get mouse button down and the Mosman that we want to check for is zero which means the left mouse button when we do this we can set our start swipe position so in here or you start drag position whatever you want to call it we can create a private vector3 which is going to be our start swipe plus issue I don't know start swipe that's that's called start swipe and actually we can do this as a vector to mean then set start swipe equal to input get mouse button Oh dad no input dot mass position there we go and this is actually going to work and I'm gonna show you that in a second but first we also want to check if input get mouse button up so when we release the button again we want this to be the left mouse button well then we want to set n swipe equal to our current Mouse position so we can go in here and create a private vector to called n swipe and we can set n swipe equal to input dot Mouse position and let's also as soon as we release this button start the swipe so let's create some kind of swipe method that we call so will execute the swipe and let's create this method down here that's called swipe and in here we'll for now just throw the debug that lay log statement that kind of outputs our start swipe and our end swipe so let's put in our start swipe here + and I'm just gonna separate this with its simple here at vertical bar plus our end swipe so now if we go in here and hit play and we then start to swipe say here and move up and release we can see that the first swipe had an x value of 171 and the seven second one had an x value of 160 so we moved a tiny bit to the left on the X but on the Y here or yeah on the Y here we started at 400 and we moved all the way up to 570 so what we can do now in order to get kind of the difference between the two positions or which means also an arrow pointing from one to the other is subtract the two so instead of debug data logging start swipe and in swipe let's put in here a vector to swipe and we'll just call this our swipe and we'll set this equal to our start swipe is it starts wipe n swipe a B is B minus a sub this is n swipe start swipe so we're simply subtracting these two vectors and now in our debug deadlock we simply throw out our swipe so now we should see that if we restart and move up here and release you can see that on our X again we moved a tiny bit to the left but on our Y we moved a whole lot upwards so now we have an idea of where we are swiping and we can do this on on the X as well so let's try and move horizontally here and you can see we moved a great deal on the X and only a tiny bit on the Y and we do a angled swipe here you can see that we move well somewhat the same amount on the X&Y call so what we can now do with this is use it to apply a force to our knife we can simply go in here and say add or RB add force and we could theoretically just put in our swipe here and that would be fine we probably also want to go in and adjust a force mode to impulse and now you should see that when we hit play and try and add this force our knife just disappears and you can see on the position here that it's traveling really really quickly and that's because the numbers that we're dealing with currently are pretty freakin big because our mouse position is in screen coordinates and screen coordinates are just pixels so if our screen is 1920 by 1080 and we swipe from one side of the screen to another on the width we're going to apply a force of 1920 and that's a very big force for a knife with a mass of 1 so what we'll do instead is we don't want this to be dependent on on our current resolution so what we'll do instead is going here is and use camera dot Maine dot screen to viewport points and the cool thing about this is that it converts from screen space into viewport space and viewport space is cool because it doesn't go from depending on resolution but it goes between 0 and 1 or is it negative 1 and 1 now it's 0 & 1 so this makes everything a whole lot better and easier to manage so if you only swipe a tiny bit it's going to be a very small number and if you swipe the whole way or the whole screen it's going to be 1 so we'll do that with both both with the start swipe here and with the end swipe and if we just try and debug that lock this actually debug that lock our swipe you should see now that the numbers wicked are much more manageable so let's try and swipe up here and you can see that's a swipe of 0.2 and if we swipe more we can see that's the swipe of 0.9 and if we swipe the whole screen that's a swipe of 1 cool so now we can easily control this by simply multiplying this with some force well bearable so let's go up here and create a public float force and default this to something like 5 and then down here when we swipe we multiply that with our current force variable cool so now we should see that if we go in here and hit play and we swipe upwards yay we're gonna actually move our knife you also see that if we swipe to the right our knife moves to the right and if we swipe to the left our knife moves to the left so now we can actually shoot it around our level pretty cool so the next thing that we want to do is apply some rotation to our knife because right now when we start swiping here well our knife kind of doesn't do much it's not until it collides with something in our environment that it actually starts rotating we don't want that we want to apply a rotation every time our knife leaves the ground and I had a look at flippy knife and how they did this because there are many ways of doing this with different levels of finesse you could apply a constant torque which means that you could just apply the same amount of rotation in the same direction every time and I believe that's actually what they're doing I don't know if it's in the same direction but it I think it's at least with the same amount of rotation or I could have the speed of the rotation depend on the force but I think that's unnecessarily complicated what I want to do is simply go in here and hit RB dot add torque use this to add angular force and in here we can simply input 0 on the X 0 on the Y and then we give it a force on the Z and just like we defined a force before let's also define a torque again we want to change the force mode to impulse and that should actually be it so we can go up here and create a public float call it torque and set it equal to say 20 I think that's going to need to be a tiny bit bigger so if we now hit play we should see hey we're applying a force to our knife I think I want to kind of have it go in the opposite direction but it is working so let's do just go in here and add a minus in front of the torque and should actually already have the gameplay working that's awesome great so the next thing that I want to kind of configure here is the gravity because right now our knife flips really really quickly and the flippy knife game at least takes some more time for the knife to be in air so to change that all we need to do is go into edit project settings physics and in here we simply need to go and adjust our gravity I'm just gonna set it to something like negative point 3 or negative 3.5 let's try that and that's a whole lot better so now the knife actually has some travel time and it kind of allows you to see and waiting excitement to find out where your knife current is cool so now that we are able to flip our knife we also want some way of kind of detecting hit because right now it doesn't matter what side the knife oh it doesn't matter what size didn't Jesus Christ the language it doesn't matter what side the knife lands on it's always just going to lay down flat in the easiest position possible and we don't want this we want the on tip of the knife here to be pointy and we want it to be able to pierce materials so what we'll do is go into our knife and we'll add another Collider at the top of our knife that's it add component and let's create a circle or a sphere collider here so by default this is going to be huge and we'll definitely take the radius here and make it a whole lot smaller let's do something like 0.01 and we can then try and move it up on the Y here I'm gonna hold down alt to allow me to finetune and we can try and place this at the tip I'm actually going to make it tiny bit bigger as well and place it around there alright so if we try to use this now it's not really going to make a difference because our collider is not set as trigger so it's really just acting like another Collider in our physics system but if we go in here and set this to trigger we can then go into the knife a knife script and we can have something happen whenever our trigger collides with another object we'll do that using void on trigger enter and it definitely did some autocomplete on me there so well we don't want to do this yet cool so when we somewhere our trigger hits another Collider what we could do is go into our rigidbody and set the is kinematic variable to true and what this will do is simply freeze the rotation and position of a rigid body because the kinematic rigid body won't move unless it's told to move so if we're going here and hit play we should see that if we're able to land our knife whoo it sticks into our block and you can see on the rigidbody that it now says is kinematic of course now we can move it again but this is just a matter of going in here and whenever we start swiping we simply want to set our P that is kinematic back to false and that should be all so now when we hit play here we are able to play around with it and as soon as it hits a block it sits or it it sticks to the block and when we then try and swipe again we can see that we unhook it call so now we actually have the fundamental mechanic of this game in place next thing is simply just adding different states so you can have a success states where it hits the block that's kind of what we have now and then you can have a a not so successful state where we hit the shaft or we don't land on the wooden block and then we kind of restart the level or at least reset the position of our knife I'm also just going to take the knife here and set the start rotation to be opposite so I'm just gonna rotate it by 180 on the Z here just so that right when we start the game it's going to insert itself into the block like that I just like that feeling a lot better cool so this is actually already looking much much better and it's already fun to play around with so let's now have it so that when the knife lands or it doesn't land on the pointy side so when you fail a flip it's just going to reset the level to do this will simply go in here and use another callback method on collision enter so this means that we hit with our normal Collider the box Collider and not with our trigger and I'm just gonna go in here and remove the private and again I don't want to collect any information just yet and I'm just gonna throw out a debug that log statement here is saying we hid mmm I'm just gonna throw it fail actually so now if we hit play we should see that this only triggers when we actually hit with the wrong side of the knife and you can see this is not quite the case the reason why might be the how you've set up some of your colliders we might have a case where they both hit and that's definitely not something you you want you can fix that by simply going to your knife and try and space out the colliders a bit more I'm just gonna go in here and make sure that my sphere Collider is small enough that this won't happen and increase the distance definitely something like this and we can also easily take our box Collider and simply drag it down a bit more so now you know that both colliders aren't going to be hitting at the same time but we still have this weird case where we hit play and then as soon as we flip the knife okay there it actually didn't happen but it does happen quite a lot that after being stuck in the block and we then flip the knife let's see if we can get this to trigger there you go it prints out a message why right when we start flipping and that's definitely not behavior that we want to fix this what we can do is simply go into our on collision enter here and the first thing that we want to say is that if our B dot is kinematic well then we don't want anything to happen so we only want this to happen if we the rigid body is not kinematic meaning that it's currently flying but this doesn't fix our issue what we want to do is make sure that we can only fail flipping the knife after a tiny bit of time has occurred so right when we start flipping that doesn't count so we want to wait about say point 1 second and the easiest way to do this is go up here and create a private float and we'll call this time maybe time fly time start flight time start air time start swipe time time I don't know time when we started flying there we go best naming ever so now inside of our swipe we can set the time when we started flying equal to time time and then inside of our on collision enter we can check we're going to create a variable here called time in air and set this equal to the time when we started flying except we want to subtract this from our current time so we start swiping the knife starts flying we set the time at which this happened equal to time to time and then when the knife collides with something we check for the time in air by taking the time that we collide with something and subtracting the time when we started flying and we can then check if that time in air is greater than or equal to say 0.1 second I don't think that was the best way to explain it but I believe I got through it I'm sorry resume a bit slow I woke up with an hit with a headache today might be kind of mixing my terms together but basically what we what we're doing is just checking if we've been in air for a little while before we start colliding the things and if we have well then there's no Cheers then we've messed up and our knife has landed on the wrong side and so we can go ahead and restart let's create a restart method here and on it's let's also create the method down here and all we want to do in here is simply go and restart our level to do that we need a reference to court to do that we need to include unity engines at scene management and here we can simply call scene manager load scene and the scene that we want to load is scene manager dot active scene get active scene build index so basically we're just loading the currently loaded scene so restarting the level and if we try and save this now and hit play we should see that if we flip the knife and land on the wrong side our level restarts also make sure to go under file and build settings and remember to add your level here whenever you're doing any scene switching and also you will notice that if we flip and then on the wrong side a lighting does kind of look weird and again this happens all the time when you try and switch a scene in unity all you need to do is open up the lighting panel so go window and then lighting and then settings and scroll to the bottom here where it says autogenerate you need to disable that and hit generate lighting and that's because unity generates the lighting right before starting the scene and it doesn't have time to do that when you're switching scene and so you see a scene without any generated lighting but now that we've generated it manually and we then mess up oops didn't mess up that whew this should definitely registers so we probably need to decrease our time here a bit but we should now see that when we mess up lighting doesn't change so that's a lot better and let's just go in here and decrease this time to say point zero five cool so that's basically everything for the knife flipping and kind of error checking except if we play now and actually managed to stick our knife I can't believe I just did that in the first try it did you guys see that that was almost like that was good so um if we manage to stick our knife into the ground object well that counts as a fail as well because we only want to do this on the wooden blocks so what we need to do is actually check what we're colliding with and we knew that in here we can gather some information about what we collided with by agoin Collider and we can just call it coal I mean then go in here and check if coal tag is equal to block or wood or whatever then we want to set a schematic to true if it's not so else we simply want to restart so we can go in here and call restart and then of course we need to go to a wooden block and we need to set the tag here to wooden block so now we added it and we also want to we also want to set it there we go so if we now hit play and managed to I think I messed something up guys well best game of the year 2017 let's try and see so if cold attack is equal to Blagh did I did I not call to the net Oh wouldn't block that makes more sense yes yes you can stop spamming in the comments all right so wouldn't block it of course needs to be the same tag that's why I don't hardcode things or at least use controlc controlv so if we now try and do this I still need to land this shut Jesus Christ that I think I landed it there but you get the point yeah all right so that would definitely have stuck on to the ground except we created this rule so now you have to do it on the wood block awesome that's basically it I mean that's everything I wanted to show for this game next definitely add score depending on the amount of flips add more more blocks and platforms that you can jump to add more knives definitely play around with the balance a bit of course and make your camera follow the knife that would be kind of the next things that I would add to this game but I think this is the base mechanic and I think it works pretty well and yeah a lot of the stuff that I'm talking about here is something that we've covered in previous tutorials we've done smooth camera follow a bunch of times I have a separate video on that if you want to know how to make your camera follow the knife and I definitely trust you guys this ability to be able to add these sort of things if you guys want we can definitely um have a look at how to make it look a bit better like the example project I did before by adding some some effects because this was pretty short tutorial but let me know if that's something you're interested in the comments or in the chat so used to recording video and if not we can just switch right on to the QA it's it's really up to you guys so let me know what you want to see the most cool we actually got through it bit bit if you hear in there look we managed to let's see so yeah yeah awesome with some particles as well that's a good idea of definitely should add some particles Wendy and when the knife lands all right so definitely a lot of people saying that we should that we should check out check out some of the graphics here so it's actually really really easy what I want to do is let me go to edit project settings quality I want to go into your intends to pick select count to around ten decrease antialiasing to disabled and I'm also just gonna set the shadow resolution to very high because who doesn't like very high quality sheriffs then I'm going to go into edit project settings and player and here I'm gonna change the color space from gamma to Linea this is definitely going to change the look of your game quite a bit and require you to bump up the strength on your light so I'm going to go into lighting here change the ambient light to maybe that might be a bit too much 1.5 and I'm gonna take the directional light here and definitely increase the strength on this to something like two then we can go and go window asset store and we want to search for the postprocessing stack let's find it here postprocessing and there by unity and import and it's going to start importing that's awesome that's it import here and it should be really quick because it's basically just scripts all of it there's also a lens flare dirt which was unreasonably large in earlier versions at least I don't know if they've kind of fixed that but Leinster three I believe used to be like twenty megabytes so really hope that they've decreased the size of that with on the new version I think they have but let's see alright so we have it in here let's just check if they've actually done this and dirt yes much much much smaller now that's good because it was it was bad I don't know how that slipped through so now we can go and create a postprocessing profile will call this CC for color correction again if I'm going over these steps very quickly that's because I feel like I have covered them in the um in the how to make good graphics in unity video definitely check that out if you want to learn more about what it is that I'm doing but I just want to show how you could apply it to this project as well so I just disabled multisample into antialiasing and added the postprocessing behavior I'm also going to change the render path to deferred and I'm gonna switch into the CC postprocessing profile here I'm going to add a vignette I'm going to add a color grading and see I'm going to change the tone mapper to filmic and there we go and now I can really start to see the need to kind of switch around some of the lighting that's changed the post exposure to something like point three let's maybe also decrease the vignette a tiny bit something like that is better and now we can go in and adjust some of the lighting I want to increase ambient lighting and maybe also decrease or directional light here to 1.8 I think that's a bit better and the main thing main problem with this I think is on the cameras background color here let's try and definitely brighten this up and maybe make it a bit more vibrant also something like that looks a lot better and we're kind of starting to get the look that I was talking about we can also go in here and add ambient occlusion and if you want this to be really nice you can decrease the amount or the radius here and up the sampling and especially if you disabled down sampling now this is a huge performance cost but it will make it look a lot more crispy then we can go into antialiasing and just choose the fast approximate that will be fine we can also add depth of field but I don't think it's needed for the scene and of course bloom if you want the shine don't think that's needed needed either and finally we can add motion blur yes please so now when we hit play and kind of swipe on a knife here we can see that looking a lot more smooth then we can see the graphics just yeah the rendering just looks nicer now it looks more complete also we can actually swipe while in midair now that's just a matter of creating a boolean saying if we are in air don't allow us to swipe we can actually just use RP that is kinematic to check for that that should be a symbol s going into our knife script here and then um we simply check if our P that is kinematic is false so if it's not kinematic yet that means we're in air we can simply return out of the update and not do anything and now we should see that if we play and transcribe while in midair that shouldn't be possible and indeed it is not it's only once we land then we can actually do that so that is how I applied the postprocessing and kind of got that nicely looking dingy this is also some of these settings aren't definitely not recommended on mobile I don't think you should do stuff like ambient occlusion without down sampling be careful these settings in general be careful with high quality shadows really think about whether or not you want linear and deferred I don't even know what the support is for that I haven't developed for mobile in a long time so I'm not gonna recommend anything there but this is more of a desktop platform look cool so yeah that's basically it for the tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it I think it was pretty fun I will of course make sure to put all of this stuff up on github once we're done and with the video Sunday I'll make sure to have that and a link to that that both includes of course the entire project and also the knife model if in case for some reason you thought this was worth using in one of your projects cool so let's switch over to Q and a let's see here let's go to chat mode yes awesome and I'm also just going to brighten up my camera a tiny bit here if I can do so while it's right something happened there that wasn't supposed to happen okay that's better just thought I lost the camera there for a second are you guys also seeing kind of glitchy camera things here the framerate seems really low on my software I hope that's not on your end because it's not looking too good I that was probably yep lots of lag okay that's great to know yeah I fixed it alright it was just a simple setting never trying to adjust settings while live streaming I guess is the lesson to learn here but I'm just gonna bump up the brightness here so there we go doesn't look like I'm stuck in a cave cool bring on the questions let's see do you consider creating a game and putting it on the market not right now I simply don't have the time but I would love to create a game and and put it on Steam or the App Store at some point it's definitely yeah something that I would like to do can you do an asset bundle tutorial I haven't actually used asset bundles for anything just yet but sure I would be interested in doing that at some point but I would definitely have to learn it first let's see can you make one tutorial in your RPG series showing how you can shoot fire matching and do burning damage over time so the RPG series is fairly close I don't think I will be releasing any more videos on that because I've covered all the very fundamental mechanics that I wanted to cover when studying this series and also all the stuff that Sebastian has prepared graphics for that being said I might do something with RPG mechanics on standalone videos maybe something with spells let's see do you have a job except from YouTube no YouTube is my fulltime job and the same thing for Sophia so this is all we do which is also a good place to plug the patron page so if you like videos like this if you like live streams and if you like the content in general you can go to patreon.com/scishow our keys to support us with a monthly donation off your choosing it can be any amount we have some rewards to say thank you and yeah it's really just an awesome way to support us and keep the content going so if you want you can go to pitch in dark on Stark is that's that's kind of it really helps disco can you do it's a turtle on mobile controls maybe at some point could be fun have you let's see I did answer that one did I ever work with unreal not on a professional game project no but I have played around with it in my spare time definitely want to do some tutorial stuff on it just at some point but I haven't gotten around to it yet right now we were pretty focused on and trying out some of the game design related stuff but I definitely want to have to do more with it such a good engine can you make a tutorial on shader lab maybe at some point I try to stay away from tutorials focusing on acids because they so often go out of style and it kind of it's limited how many people are interested in on seeing a tutorial on a particular assets but maybe maybe at some point could you do it tutorial on the new playable director may be I am working on a tutorial on timeline I said it yes so that is coming up can you come up with a question for me to ask you nope can you do a tutorial with server download Jason and serialization so that is a really big request server stuff is not my strongest suit maybe do something with it at some point Jason and civilization is definitely on the list but I do already think there are some pretty good JSON tutorials on YouTube if you search for it I don't know I don't remember the name of the guy who did them but I believe it's the first ones that come up when you search for JSON and unity a really good stuff what is a better engine for graphics you Unreal Engine 4 or unity both both can do awesome things if you want to customize your graphics as much as possible choose unity if you want that really sort of standard triplea look unreal is easier and faster to get that with and on we does have some graphical capabilities that unity doesn't but the same for unity especially when it comes to VR and that sort of stuff did you already make a video for like shortcuts in the editor or for vs vs s ratio studio I did make two videos on unity tips that you can check out just called top unity tips that's kind of shortcuts and nice to know things so yeah but I could do more if you guys want can you make a VR game tutorial I don't have a VR headset not right now let's see can you can you do it tutorial about animation depends on what you mean by animation I'm not a good animator like not at all I'm going to make a flight simulator series because I'm having trouble with it yeah I get you match flight simulators are really really math heavy and physics heavy and it's not the easiest thing in the world to create especially because you need to load in real world data which is hard and you need actually you need it recently partnered up with another company doing doing some geospatial data stuff that you should definitely check out but I don't think it's something I'll be doing a tutorial on right now might do something with flight mechanics can you make a series on a tycoon game I love tycoon games there's so fun and they're definitely also fun to make very system heavy but really cool maybe do something with it at some point might do something for a Ludum diary actually I'll have to think about that the way that's great thank you send you outside so that's awesome what's my favorite game that's such a hard question to answer and I can never do it the games that I've played the most are probably well the for craft counterstrike yes modern warfare 2 yes that's that's honest I'm not proud of it but I had a lot of fun with that game and yeah that's probably the most played games I've played so much Garry's Mod as well that's that's just such a fun game to play around with it so you have a tutorial about particles I don't think I have one dedicated to particles and I definitely would like to change that it's on the list am I still playing with the four craft I don't have an active subscription right now but I do have a level of 100 characters so sometimes it depends on what month you ask did I enter this new room dari no bummed about it and I it looks like I won't be able to participate in the next one either because it's on top of three mag and I'm going to Dreamhack so that's but I have created a game in my spare time that I'm making a making of video for so hope that you are going to enjoyed that that's coming up is it actually over no but the tutorial part is what is the next tutorial that is I don't remember what is if we have schedules here let me I don't remember oh sorry who's that girl behind it said she sits over there and that's a fear she's the moderator and my lovely girlfriend have you published on the Play Store nope can you make an ad network comparison video I'm sorry that's too specific I don't think so any idea how you would implement an object spawning in 3d in this runner sure check out the I think you can just use the wave spawner tutorial that I did and kind of just do something similar it really depends on how you set it up but check out the wave spawner in if you want to learn about how to spawn objects at burn time will you publish a tutorial on youtube all the time including this one will you post any videos on procedural levels I have done a tiny bit of procedural generation but it was very little and I definitely want to do more with it but I also think that are really really really really good videos on procedural generation already especially it's the best in Lake the guy that I collaborated with to do the RPG tutorial series has a lot of stuff and procedural generation check him out what do I prefer to your 3d I actually don't know the answer to that question I think my goto is often 2d stuff because I feel like I'm better at 2d art that I'm am at modeling but when it comes to just game making in general I feel they're both really really fun I always try and choose the one that's simplest for me depending on the scope of the project so whatever I think is going to be easier to make is what I normally choose will you ever redo the survival game series it's outdated I know it's outdated I'm sorry thank you to all the people who've watched it it was an amazing experience creating the Survival Series and watching it grow from pretty much nothing to actually a pretty big series and I think the first video has over a million views and that's insane and I don't think I will able will ever redo it I might do something on survival games but I don't think I will do a direct remake simply because I switch away from the huge amount of tutorials in one series format I mean that series was so long and I couldn't see myself doing that once more but could definitely deduce do something with with survival games again or the fantasy style which is kind of transition to its English my favorite or in my native language no it's Danish and I think that's kind of I'm kind of struggling with the English today again I had a headache earlier and kind of mumbles everything together I'll probably be better tomorrow definitely not my native native language I do kind sometimes catch myself thinking in English that helps I guess we'll continue working with flippy knife no I don't think I will continue this project this is just a oneoff for you guys to continue with and if you make something cool that they definitely shared with me on Twitter at practice 3 definitely do that I really encourage you to do that more I love seeing what you guys make um when did I start programming that's a lot of years back that's probably seven years back I don't know estimate in unity at least are you going to do some voxel stuff that's kind of in the same category as procedural generation in general check out the best in Lake and then maybe I will do something at some point can I move a character with nav mesh agent using arrow keys yes of course don't necessarily see why you would do that that would be better to just the whole idea with nav mesh agents is that they find the path and you don't directly control them can you make that would be better to just do using a rigid body and then adding some forces depending on which way you press and then having everything physics enabled can you make a tutorial on saving in game changes to these scenes so that's actually a good idea and and I definitely want to do more with civilization and saving I do have a video on creating a high score which show us how to use player pref to store data and that oh oh when you say saving in game changes to the scene you mean when you when you change things and then stop playing I think that's what you mean I just realized I think there's a plucking on the asset store for that actually but I don't imagine doing a video on it right now how did I learn programming tutorials and practice and a bit of advice from friends and to books can you do a card game tutorial like how stone or at least a tutorial to draganddrop I would love to do something with card games at some point I think it looks super fun to do and I've always been a huge Amira huh stone and the development team I think they get way too much flame compared to what an amazing game they've actually created I think creating something like that in unity requires skill and a whole lot of it and dedication and I think has done in general is a really really beautiful game and it flows so well and it's supported on so many platforms I am really impressed with how stone in general so trying to do something similar could be really really fun can you make it to turn on how to make mission for your game I'm sorry I don't understand the question say hello in Danish Danish please or anything hi yeah that's there I'm sorry to disappoint you can you make an application that uses realworld data maybe do you talk English at home and not really actually sometimes Sophia and I just switch to English but that's mostly for jokes will you continue to your csharp tutorial maybe at some point if I find a subject that I think I need to cover do you type with all 10 fingers yes and I think we're kind of nearing the end here guys so find the questions and we can wrap up the stream and I will make sure to upload everything and make everything ready and I will of course have the full thing available on on Sunday so final questions and we'll wrap this bad boy up I still have some work to do today after this dream so that's that's kind of whoa I just flash the lights who have you ever considered to join the unity team well I first of all that's not only up to me but I have been in contact with unity and I a lot of the guys there and I think they're all really nice and I think unity seems like a great company to work at so maybe at some point in the future but right now even if I got the offer I probably wouldn't because I think this is so so much fun and so interesting but these sorts of things change all the time and Who am I to say what's going to happen in the future um thank you so much to all the guys we appreciate the tutorials that's awesome thank you for the kind words you guys really Rock have you ever made your own game engine yeah I've made made a few um they weren't good and I didn't get very far with them but I have definitely tried making my own engines both in C++ and in Java and have you ever considered working with a team to create a game yeah that would be really fun to do and if I didn't spend so much time on these videos and this channel that's probably what I would be doing but I think right now this is more important for me and final question final question this needs to be a good one guys we're wrapping it up um let's see I need a good one guys give me one final final final question why haven't you published any game yet okay so that's the final question I have published Ludum dare games now but why I haven't published a game to steam or a larger game that I've been working for on for a longer time that would be simply time constraints I have tried creating games on the side while doing these videos but it's simply too taxing and I can't really seem to get it to the point where I feel like this is something that I could charge for and this is something that deserves to be on this team or or iOS Store or the Google Play Store or whatever so that would simply be it it's simply because this is what I've been doing for the last five years and it takes up a lot of time and also I've been undergoing education and everything so I really haven't had the time to dedicate myself to a game project for whatever amount of time it would take between a half year and five years so yeah time all right that's the final question but I really want to do one in the future I don't want to sound all depressed about it stuff all right thank you so much for all the question guys you you're just awesome and I had a really fun time with this this livestream and thank you so much for all of the nice support on the videos recently they've been doing really good really well and I'm really excited to see that it really keeps the fear and I going when we see a lot of people liking and all the positive comments and and just seeing that you're watching the videos so thank you so much for that thank you for this dream again if you want to support all this stuff you can go to
