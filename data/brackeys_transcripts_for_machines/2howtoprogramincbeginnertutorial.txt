thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to the second video in how to program in C it's been such a long time since the last one and and I'm really sorry about that uh but I've been working on something really cool which you might see from the wallpaper here and I've also been traveling a lot but I'm finally back home and ready to start pumping out some videos so this is just a short one uh but we're going to take a look at something really important which is input and output meaning how we read and write from the console uh so that's super cool but first before we get started I quickly want to show you the all new brais developer Forum as you can see we have a fullon answer section uh where you can ask question and uh and and get answers uh we have a discussion section where you can share opinions about stuff and then we have showcase and collaboration so you can show your work and you can collaborate with other developers it's super awesome awesome and uh here it is this is how it looks so you can see that we have uh infinite scrolling uh there are a statistics there are different categories we have some hot topics so you can see what's trending and some top users which you can very much still um get on top of if you uh join quickly so you can simply click here to start a topic or log in you can join with both both Facebook and Twitter or just fill out the boxes and hit join it's very simple and very easy and I very much hope uh that that you will join and and be part of this quickly expanding Community because we really need to fill this up with users also thank you to all the beta users uh out there who've been uh testing and Reporting bugs it's really been helpful so if you see a bug or want a feature please just go ahead and request it I've made a topic for you to do so great so that was the introduction to today's video let's just go ahead and delve right into it so let's open up xamarin studio and once it's opened up here we're just going to load our first console project solution and now we're back to where we left off in the last video cool so what I really want you to understand right now is that coding you can't just understand everything at the same time you have to take one piece at a time and uh this piece of code right here that is automatically generates can be hard to understand um so things such as classes and namespaces are not always easy to comprehend so what we're going to do is we're going to actually ignore most of this and then we're going to focus on writing a a program that will start up and write something and uh then await some user input so for now we are going to ignore the using system the namespace the class and all we are going to be focusing on is putting code inside these two curly brackets so everything inside these two are important for us right now one thing I will quickly go ahead and say is that this right here is what is called a method it's pretty similar to what you know as a function from Unity script or uh using C in unity uh so and this is a method a method and it's called that's pretty much all we need to know about the syntax here is that this right here is the method name what this method actually does is uh it is called when the program starts that means that everything we put inside these two curly brackets will run as soon as we run the program so that's going to be pretty much our entire program program inside these for now cool so right now you can see that we have one line here called console. right line hello world uh and we're just going to go ahead and delete that because we are going to write something on our own so first off we're going to go ahead and write console so now we are writing to the console so we want to access the console class just like we have a class up here we are writing to the console class classes are going to be more clear to you what they do and and what they can be used for later then we're going to do a DOT which means that we will access all of the stuff inside the class pretty much like if you have a uh category called main uh called console and then we accessing all the subcategories all the function and values inside of that class then we want to uh do write line and you can see that it uh suggests what to do uh while we write it that's super uh super awesome and we can also when we have one of the um one of the objects here uh selected you can see that we can uh view a summary of what it does this right here is a method just like our start uh method here our main method that is called when the program starts the console class has a method called right line that will write the curent line Terminator to the standard output stream that's that basically means it will show a line on the console so we're going to go ahead and do that and then we're going to open up to parenthesis and we're going to end with a SII colon so this right here uh is how you call a function whenever you you want to call a function you you do you f the function then you open and close to uh to parentheses and you close it up with a semicolon which is very important cool so everything inside these two parentheses is what we call a parameter and a parameter is a way to pass a value onto the function so we can simply say hey function please do whatever is inside of your curly brackets and remember to use this value along the way and different functions have different parameters some functions don't even have any parameters and some functions like this one can take multiple different kinds of parameters and to view what kinds of parameters that this function will take what we can do is we can say console do right line and here above the summary which says that uh it writes the line and so and so we can also see that it says one of 19 and that's because this function can be uh called in 19 different ways meaning that it will take 19 different parameters that's a lot uh most of the functions that we are going to be creating maybe takes one but it's because that um we both want to be able to maybe write a number to the console or a fullon sentence or just one single character or maybe a number with decimals um so there are there are many different types of values that we want to send to this function and to view the different uh values uh you do shift and on windows with the number pad you do four and six uh to go back and forth but on Mac I'm pretty sure you can just do shift and then the arrow keys uh to browse through so do shift and then I'm on a window so I'm going to do six to go to the right and you can you can see that here's the first um version of this method that we can call and this takes an an oong and you can see what that does in the description but that's not what we want we don't want a long either this is a uint this is a bull and there is a string and basically I haven't told you about variable types and what all these different uh weird names actually mean but just know that a string is uh basically a sentence it's a series of characters it can be one word or a whole sentence so we're just going to use that one so now we know that this function can take a string value so let's actually give it one so again we have the console. right line and inside of these two parentheses we're going to do these two quotation marks because everything inside these two quation marks is a string so we can do hello so I'm a computer I'm sent from the future and now we actually have a full on line that will write to the console so if we go ahead and play theoretically this should work and it will on Mac on Mac this will execute just fine but on Windows it's not going to work and I'm going to show you why so if we go ahead and hit play up here you can see that it very very quick quickly opens up the console and then closes it back down and the reason why is on Mac whenever it's done doing what it should it will just stay open until you close it but on Windows when a console application is done doing what it should it just automatically closes so what we want to do is we want to a wait for the user to do something before the console closes so to do this we're going to read from the user so again we're going to access the console we're going to do dot then we're going to type read and then you can see we have different kinds of read functions we could do read which reads the next character we could do read key which obtains the next character uh or function key pressed by the user or we could do read line which reads a whole line of characters uh which basically is a string uh but in our case we're just going to do read key so whenever the user presses a key on the keyboard uh the application is going to quit and you can go ahead and do this on Mac also it's it's gener good practice to do so go ahead and do console. re key and this is not going to take any parameters so just open and close the parenthesis and end it up with the semicolon now when we go ahead and hit play you can see it opens up a console saying hello I'm a computer I'm sent from the future and once we press something it will close back down so that's pretty much the end of this video I'm going to do something new which is give you a challenge to complete before the next video where I will show you how it's done what I want you to do is I want you to write out your age and your uh name and then I want you to avoid the user input so I want you to wait for some kind of user input and then write out a new line saying what your favorite color and then finally of course await user input so that the console doesn't uh quit immediately I'm going to show you how this is done in the next video also one Nifty trick if you want to do long sentences on multiple lines instead of just making a new console. right line uh method call every time you want to make a new line you can simply use this character right here so you do backs slash uh so reverse back slash this is and then n that will make a new line so you don't have to put spaces around this because then you will just have unnecessary spaces so just input that character which is the reverse backslash and then an n and then we can do uh let's say uh this is a new line so once we hit play on this you can see that it makes a new line cool so that was all I wanted to show for this video thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one
