this video is brought to you by our own Metta thank you so much for donating if you want to support breakage yourself you can go to patreon.com/scishow so on over comes this video in game math theory a series that covers essential mathematical concepts that you will definitely run into during your game development career today we'll be looking at sine waves the topic of sine waves is one of those fundamental mathematical phenomenons that has fascinated developers for a long time because of their simple organic nature they're used in a number of ways in totally different aspects of development such as making waves in the ocean moving around enemies or even generating sound so what is a sine wave a sine wave is a function if we observe a sine wave shown on a coordinate system we can see that if we input any value which we call X into the function sine we will get some value that's called that Y if for example we insert the value 1 into the function we get a value of 0.8 as we insert values of increasing size we can see that the resulting Y value smoothly goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to minus 1 and then back to 0 we say that the function oscillates between 1 and minus 1 from the graph it becomes clear that the function repeats itself in fact we can keep zooming out from the graph and the sine wave will always repeat to understand why this is happening we have to look at how a sine wave is constructed we begin by drawing a circle in the center of our coordinate system and giving it a radius of exactly 1 unit you'll never guess what the circle is called that's right the unit circle I need to get out more if we then draw a line from the center of the circle to a point on the circle we can create a right angle triangle where line will act as the hypotenuse now what if I told you that the angle in the lefthand corner of the triangle is actually the x value that we input into the function and that the y coordinate of the upper corner of the triangle which we can just read off the y axis is in fact the resulting value of the function so if we begin at an x value of 0 meaning that the angle will be 0 degrees and then start to increase that number we see that the height of the triangle slowly moves towards 1 then back to 0 and as our angle goes above 180 degrees the Y value becomes minus 1 and then completes the loop by going back to 0 here's how it looks together with the graph because the total number of degrees in a circle is 360 our function will repeat in intervals of exactly 360 which we also see on the graph one thing we have to be careful with when dealing with the sign function is that because it uses an angle as input we have to decide what unit of measurement we want to use most people are familiar with using degrees to measure angles but it's just as common to use radians the only difference is that instead of going from zero degrees to 360 degrees the angle goes from zero radians to two pi radians pi of course being the number 3.14 so let's have a look at a practical example where sine waves come in handy say that we want to create a cool hover animation for a coin well whenever we want to animate something over time we simply use the amount of seconds passed since we started the game as input for our sine function so in this case we could set the Y position of our coin equal to the sine of T where T is time that means that the coin starts with the Y position of zero and then smoothly moves up and down as time goes by if you want to increase the speed of our animation we would multiply our time variable with some number multiplying by two will make the animation go twice as fast just as multiplying with 0.5 will make the animation go twice as slow we can also influence how far the coin moves up and down to do this we simply multiply the entire function sine of T by a number so if you want the coin to move two units up and two units down we would multiply it by two and again we can reduce the distance that the coin moves by multiplying with a small number but hey that's just a theory at game maths the bonus fact that beep sound is made with the sine wave remember the coin is just one example of where you can insert sine functions to create repeating behaviors and hopefully this video has given you some ideas of how you can play with sine waves yourself if you make something cool or have any questions make sure to share it on the brakus forum that's pretty much all I have to show for this video if you're interested in learning more about sine waves that's a link for that in the
