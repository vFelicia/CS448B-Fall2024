hello everyone and welcome to this special Q&A video so I've reached the 200,000 subscriber mark and I'm just so excited so I want to take this opportunity to thank you guys so much for supporting me and making me want to keep making videos you guys send in a bunch of questions let's answer them what's the most important advice that you want to give to younger developers that are just starting out probably the most important advice that I have to give is for you to find something that you think it's fun and then just do that I don't think you should really find a programming language that will lead you to the best paying job or necessarily try and build up skills so you can get in on this college or whatever I think the most important thing is work on something that you have fun working on and that you want to make and then just have game development and programming be kind of the tool that you use to create that thing that really helps drive you in your own development and it's something that I found personally that when I do that I just learn so much quicker what car do you have I don't have a car in fact I don't even have a driver's license it's pretty normal to ride a bike in Denmark how do you set the goals for each coding session you seem to have a structure that allows you to do everything so smoothly Thanks how can I do the same what tips do you have for planning a session this one I have something about if you need to write a big scary module and have a hard time kind of knowing where to start and where to end you should really plan ahead before you actually start coding I suggest just sitting down with a blank piece of paper and sketching out what you want to end up with and kind of breaking that down into smaller functions really I think having a good overview of your code is really up to creating very small functions that only do one thing the more you're able to split your code into small functions the more you're able to describe what you're actually doing oh and it also helps that I always practice my tutorials before recording now that you have two hundred thousand subscribers what will you do with all the money you're in I think there's a lot of confusion about how much money youtubers actually earn I can say for a fact I don't earn a lot of money in fact I hardly earn enough to make a living at least off of YouTube ads having two hundred thousand subscribers does not mean a lot of views and definitely not a lot of ad revenue it's really the best thing you can do if you want me to keep making videos is support me on patreon which you can do it patreon.com slash Brady's that was pretty smooth when we get to play an official game made by you do you sell any of the games you make and if you sell games where can we buy them from in fact I don't currently sell any of my games online really most of what I create these days are hobby projects or stuff for tutorials my latest creation is probably my Ludum dare entry and that's just a silly thing I made in 48 hours so I wouldn't really have a place to point you if you want to play one of my games on Steam or anything like that can you please make a turnbased strategy game tutorial I would love to do some more with strategy based games I think the tower defence course covers a lot of the stuff that you're going to need when creating that kind of game but if enough of you guys ask for it I'll definitely see what I can do what was the proudest moment of your life that's definitely when I scored that lovely lady standing behind the camera how is it to be one of the biggest Danish youtubers this is actually a pretty fun question because um I am on some kind of top list there when it comes to subscriber count' or something like that but I always get forgotten in Danish media I see so many of these out top Danish youtubers and one of the biggest Danish youtubers and I just always get ignored I think people are probably not so interested in tutorial makers and really don't see it as a youtuber thing more as a nerdy thing that they want to stay away from less in fact the Danish YouTube award show that I never get invited to I'm not salty about that at all what's your cat's name always loved the surprise appearances I'm glad you guys like those they are annoying as heck for me so this is Charley say hi and this is Molly she just woke up so this is a good one how do you get game ideas I would like to know um if you know how to get game ideas definitely make a video about it because I don't have a good answer really what you should do is just sit down try and draw something out as quick as you possibly can just as many ideas as possible and I think that's the best way to kind of get your creative side going what you can also do is think of games you like and then ways that you can put been on that or recreated with your own personal touch of course I tried to put some kind of twist in there but it's also a good exercise just to try and recreate something some other better developer did before you so I think that's pretty much all the questions we're going to do now I had a lot of fun and if you want to see more of these Q&A videos definitely let me know also if you're just hungry for more questions and answers you can always check out the end of each monthly live stream where we do a live Q&A so thanks for watching
