hello everyone and welcome to the 10th video in our survival game series done by practice I am the CEO of Brad keys and today we are going to take a look at the tree generation tool in unity and all just pimping up the terrain so if we go ahead and open up unity let's start out by simply making our project pane look a little better so right click create folder and we could call this materials and select all of the materials and simply drag them and we could also make one for the textures again new folder and call it textures and drag each and every one of the textures right so on if we go ahead and rightclick in the project pane and then import asset and then import the tree creator it's going to go ahead and import everything we need this can take a little while depending on the complexity of your project right so now we are pretty much ready to get started so first of all you can see that we have a new option under the terrain called refresh tree and detailed prototypes and if we go ahead and inspect the folder that is now in our project pane so double click the standard assets you can see that we have a folder called tree creator and in here is a big tree which is already generated so if I drag this in you can see looking pretty good and if we select it you can see how it was built in the right hand side in the hierarchy I'll go ahead and delete this once again and if we go back into the tree creator you can see our different sources the materials some leaves and some textures alright so we could go ahead and simply make a new tree so go to game object create other and then tree and now you can start to see all of the detail we can change all of the attributes that we can simply change inside of unity and the tree will react in the scene so if we go ahead and drag this out a bit and soomin on it by selecting it in the scene view and hitting F so we get a good look first of all in the right hand side in the inspector window we have a slider called the tree seed and you can see the value here is pretty huge that's because this is simply on the number that defines which kind of randomly generated tree we are going to use so if I just drag this along unity is going to create all the different kinds of trees that can emerge from the randomized settings that we have set so if I take the if I mess with some of these settings then this will also change so this is simply the seed that is going to change once we create a lot of different trees alright so um you can go ahead and manipulate some of these settings now I will leave them be the interesting parts come when we start to select the branch itself so this is a branch group and here's the branch note itself so if we select this and look over in the scene view you can see this purple line going through the tree and these different squares on the way the squares are waypoint for the generation of the tree so simply these can be moved these can be selected and dragged so and by doing this we can create our own kind of shape so you can simply manipulate these as you would with any other game object and we can create trees all on our own so again we have a group seed we have a frequency of how many trees are going to be spawned inside of the if we select the other you note the tree root node inside of the area spread so simply how many trees are going to be spawned inside of this variable so that's the frequency and let's pump it up so we can get something like a group of smaller branches the distribution meaning how they are going to be planted whether it's going to be completely random really it's going to be on a straight line if it's going to make cross a cross or other kinds of shapes so that is something again to play around with the growth scale simply is how long the different trees are going to get the growth angle as you can see simply rotates the trees based on their lowest point the little circle all right so I'm moving on we can we have the geometry category and if we crank up and down the LOD multiplier see if I can get this working I'm not really I guess this will do then you know what let's leave this as is for now so let's go ahead and move on to the material so here I have just loaded up some of the basic some of the materials in my scene in my project pane let's try them with the big tree branch this comes with the tree generator and you can create some on your own or download some from the asset store so as you can see this creates a texture and a material and it is completely tileable so it will figure out the UV itself so that's pretty handy the break material will ignore that for now the length the length of the branches without affecting the max point we have the relative length so that changes the way they scale and if we just drag out some of the arrows we can change how big the difference between how big they can get that's simply simply the difference right so remember all these settings are based on the fact that these are randomly generated the radius how wide are the trace gonna play and the cap smoothing how smooth the crink Glynnis the twirling the sikh son I think that this is going to help them yes assembly point towards the Sun a little bit uh curliness and the noise against whirling and the scaling of the noise and we have the break chance so this was will help out if your computer is having difficulty and the wind if you want to apply wind zones but for now we'll leave this be so that's basically the generate a general idea of creating trees and branches now let's go ahead and create some leaves so if we take down the frequency but bring up the scale so the overall length and the width let me see the radius here you can get some bigger trees that might have leaves and if we go into at the top of the higher you can create a leaf group so just let the computer thing for a minute and there you go so we can select our leaves and we can go down and give them a material so go under the materials and then select a leaf material this one is all right we can go ahead and increase the size or what the size hmm I'm how I'm having some trouble convert to procedural yeah okay so the groups were inputs procedural I might have edited them by hand by mistake so if you get that simply click that you want them to be procedural so now we can change the frequency to create more leaves and we can go ahead and change the material to make them look pretty there you go and okay this will need some tweaking so if again all hand editing should not be we can distribute them just like the trees in different ways I'll just choose where and them though and we can change the size of the leaves the alignment and the wind it's the turbulence of the leaves all right so that's how you create leaves so Panna for now I'll go ahead and delete these leaves once again by selecting them in the hierarchy and pressing the trashcan and now we can go ahead and create a new branch group like this so this allows us to create branches on the base of our tree and we'll select again the branch big tree branch material working with the cheat tree generator can be a little slow though okay so let's play around with the frequency I want this to be pretty low and the distribution I think this could be random yeah this this looks pretty good the length again play around with this and again all these settings are not the same except there are emitting from the branch the main branch itself so we could go ahead and select our arms these circles and move the branches up and down this way so we can get them to be at the top of the tree like this and this allows us to if we go ahead and OH convert to the procedural bump up the frequency a bit make the make them point upwards so play around with the different kinds of spread at the button to make it look better and pull and the krinkle nests these seek Sun we can make them point upwards and yeah this looks pretty good so now we could go ahead and edit them by hand so we won't have all the branches at the bottom right so now on top of this we can create a leaf group and now we can crank up the frequency quite a bit to change the material and there we go so now the trees look a lot better play around with it until you find something you really like and and there you go that's how to use the tree generator in unity I hope you enjoyed this tutorial if you haven't already checked out our website it's looking really good I'll just open it up so you can see it so we have a lot of different things here there are still some minor box that needs to be fixed basically it syncs with everything our Facebook our Twitter so it's a good place to stay in stain shield we I have a block going well right about some of the news on our site and our Learning Network in general also some of the news on our games and there you can all all already download all of our games if we go to the portfolio you can see you can download kill pill and see now is the game and also if we go under the create a survival game tutorial series you can read about it you can watch it and you can of course download all the assets that I create outside of the videos the scripts that are typed also so everything that we use that isn't created inside of unity itself and isn't as and is a script or a model or anything like that you can download it as a raw file and simply use it for whatever you want it's completely free so go ahead and do that if you have trouble keeping up and also we have added a donate function if you want to just buy me a cup of coffee so I'm that was it for now thanks for watching the video and I'll see you in the next one Oh
