thanks for tuning in at brakus I want to welcome to this video and making a multiplayer PS in unity today we are going to be looking at something really exciting which is importing a coollooking arena adding a bunch of particle effects and playing around with the lighting to make our scene look a lot more awesome so I've really been looking forward to this video we're not going to be writing a single line of code but we have plenty of stuff to do and the arena of course is custom made and you can use it in any way you like also commercially it's available for download now for free as part of the multiplayer FPS assets pack so without further ado let's jump right into it so you can see that I'm here in unity and I just want to begin by setting up the light the lighting settings so if you go to window and select our lighting it's somewhere here for some reason I kept there it is if you haven't got it open and I like to dock it over here by the inspector and we just want to make sure that our arm build settings down here when it comes to the light Maps is set to auto just so that it will auto build everything as we change things as we go and then we pretty much want to close down unity here or minimize it find the multiplayer FPS assets when you've downloaded those and I've prepared an arena unity package and I've done this because the arena is huge and it has a bunch of models and textures and materials and it's way too much to fit into well even several videos to set all of that up so I've gone ahead and done most of it and we'll just finish it off in this video if you want to do all of this on your own or say edit some of the source files I have included those here so the arena source files let's build up both a blender version and an FBX version and all of the textures that you might use are in here but you can also just import the unity package and then edit the files from there which I definitely recommend you do so please please use this if if you can also on the unity package uses the blender file which means that in order for unity to import and process it properly we will need to have blender installed there will be a link to that in the description it's not a large programming and in any way and it's great to have because it's well friendly awesome to model in so I just definitely just recommend you go over there and install blender so without further ado let's doubleclick on the arena unity package to open it up in unity here and we can of course deselect different stuff but we just want to import all of it let's say hit import here and this will take a little while because we do have a lot of textures some of them fairly high resolution and some fairly high um detailed models so it will take a little while especially because we have all of the relations between the objects already set up for you so unity has remembered all that stuff but as soon as the as this is done you will see that you get an arena folder over here and in here we have the R this is the model itself you can double click this and it will open up in blender we have a materials folder with all of the different materials that we are going to need and it's actually gone ahead and included some that we don't need so I'm just going to go ahead and delete all of the weirdly named ones which is all of these these shouldn't even be in here it's just the way that unity exports unity packages sometimes it's a bit annoying so you can just select the same ones that I am selecting here if you want to get rid of them or you can just leave them in there it's not going to make a huge difference so just delete all of those and I'm going to do the same with okay so the textures are actually already set up so that was pretty much all we needed to do and now we can just take the arena prefab here which is the one that I've set up for you and simply drag it into a project panel and you should see that all of the textures are here nothing appears weird or anything if it does you might have deleted something that you weren't supposed to so just make sure you don't delete anything I didn't and you can see that this already looks fairly cool but we have so much that we can add it inside of this and you can pretty much click on anything and edit the material or whatever all of the inspectors settings are here so that's pretty cool but what I wanted to go ahead and do is take our environment here and then drag our directional light out from that and maybe call this our Sun and then um you can remove or just disable the environment that we had before just so we only have the arena to work with here so my arena is centered I I think you should do the same thing and basically what I want to begin with here you can see that I've actually made a short to do this here we start by importing the arena well we just did that now we need to set a few layers because the arena here actually I already has some colliders set up if we are select for example the floor here you can see it has a mesh Collider over here however in order for our player to be able to stand on top of this using the system where we're a cast to check if the it's if the player is collidable with this so that he will be able to hover a certain distance above the ground we will have to make sure to change all of the layers where we want that to happen to collidable environment and i've actually done this with my prefab but if your settings are different you will have to go in and do this yourself so make sure to make a tag it as whatever you have called that tag in my case it's collidable environment and you will have to do that with all of the flying platforms as well and you can see here it hasn't done that so let's go and change the layer I believe it just attack if the layer that you want to change you can of course also going and and tagged stuff differently so that will just set that up and that's pretty much all I meant by set layers now we need to position our scene camera because we have our scene camera here and currently it gets an overview of the entire map and that's fine but it doesn't necessarily look too good from the outside so let's find somewhere inside of our scene that looks nice and I'm just going to position it somewhere around here is a pretty nice look I think it gives a pretty nice overview of the map but still with a bit of perspective and what you can do if you've positioned your scene here in a way that you would like your camera to be is press on the scene camera and then press control ship shift F and if you're on a Mac that would be command shift F and it's the same as going to I believe it's game object and then I line with our view and you can see that the scene camera has now snapped to that view so in the game view here will now be the same as the scene view of course not if we change anything you're not seeing the and the camera is still static oops let's just drag that back there cool so I think that looks pretty nice and you can of course position it otherwise and what we also want to do to our scene camera here is just make sure this is not a solid color but that it's also using the skybox however it's not currently visible cone so that was on that now we can go in here we've positioned the camera and it's using the skybox that's perfect now we want to set up another skybox because I think the default skybox is nice for a lot of things but I don't think it kind of suits the style that I'm going for with this arena which is kind of an evening look where the Sun is setting or rising of course and yeah so I want to find something that looks a bit like that and if you do too then go to the asset store and search for skybox and again you find the asset store by going to window and then opening up the asset store it's something here cannot find anything today so we have the asset store right there ok so tunnel vision and search for sky box and hit free only and you actually get a bunch of very high quality sky boxes that you can use in your game and I really like the one called cope here the free skybox pack so if we go ahead and hit import on this that's a really nice guy box in here called sunset which is pretty much perfect for what for the look that I'm going for so let's go ahead and hit import on that and it's just going to import all of the textures and the materials that it set up and it shouldn't take long it's already done here and I'm is going to call this skyboxes there we go and this is again of course free so you can download it as well or find some other pack that suits you and then we'll go under your lighting and we'll change the default skybox to instead be sunset okay so this kind of this very much changes the look of our scene but I think this skybox is absolutely beautiful so that's what we are going to be using and I want to boost the ambient intensity of the light by something like two maybe even two point three I really want that to be very bright by default I think that gives it a nice look in here and we'll also get some other lights in here as well of course so all the other settings I believe we can pretty much leave as is we might want to drag our Sun into the Sun slot right there and we can also find the skybox find the Sun set here and I think the skybox is amazing but it is a tiny bit too dark so what I like to do is go in here and simply bring up the exposure to something like 1.2 and then we'll just boost the overall brightness of the skybox a tiny bit cool I think it's time to mess around with the light but let's see what I have planned here so now it's time to set up lighting and when it comes to lighting I think it's great to start with a cool directional light we already have that in here and I basically want to rotate this to something like 11 negative 108 and 20 and I believe that should rotate it to kind of point to what the Sun in our skybox it's actually a bit off so we can just go ahead and rotate it a tiny bit there just so it points in the general direction and the general direction off on the Sun from our skybox I believe that gives the greatest look and you can see the kind of the sun shining in on just part of the arena here and that gives a very cool feel to it so I will also edit the color here and I've actually prepared a color that I think works nice with the scene kind of an evening color here but you can choose your own or just copy the hex color from down here I want the intensity to be somewhere like 1.3 so it is kind of bright but still you can see that it's it's disappearing between the hills and I definitely want soft shadows to be on I think that gives a very nice look for the directional light but you might want to not have that on some of the point lights that will be adding later so that was all for the Sun what I also want to do is kind of have a central light in the middle of the arena maybe up towards the ceiling here and you can see that nice glowing effect that we have on this that kind of just gives the arena some indoor mood light so that's um rightclick go light and point light and let's set this up so I want this to be at a yvalue of something like two point six five maybe something like that just in the middle of the arena I want the range to be something like 25 the color and I've prepared a color again here just so we don't spend too long trying to get that right you can see it just gives this very nice warm feel almost as if it was coming from this sign up here that's kind of the point you can maybe just raise it a tiny bit and I want the intensity I think to pretty much just be one however to make this effect really nice what I will do is I will go ahead and enable hot cast shadows and this will of course take some performance if you're making this game for a mobile application you probably don't want to have hard shadows on your point lights or at least you want to be careful with how many you have but on a stationary computer or a modern laptop this should not be a problem whatsoever so I just think it really gives a nice feel you can see all of the bars here shining onto the chairs that looks kind of cool you can see what that does to the environment good so yep that all looks nice and we can go in here and just make sure lighting data set was build with an in yeah we can now get that rid of the by removing the auto here and going clear big data and then choosing Auto again and it's going to auto bake the light map now so that's perfect and where do we want to go from now well I definitely want to have some more light in here but I want to have some flames under the obstacles here some cool flame particles and we'll have them light up the arena as well and we'll have them be animated so that they vary in intensity that's a really nice feel so we'll call this the arena center light and we could make this part of the prefab but I'll just keep it out of it for now just so we preserve the original prefab I don't know it just feels better so let's start by doing that as well okay so the next thing on our list here is setting up the flying platforms because at the moment they look at tiny bit boring so again I want to create these huge flames from underneath and we will of course defy physics on this one but I think it's okay because we do have fighting robots in what looks to be a clash between a scifi and a Roman Stadium so it's not really realism we're going for it anyways so let's go in here and let's find a cool particle effect to work off of and it's just so happens that unity standard acids include some very cool particle effects especially almost there flames that look really nice and that are very easy to edit so let's just use that as a base for what we're going to be making so but I just noticed that we have a bunch of scripts down here cluttering everything so I'll just take all the scripts into the scripts folder and the room list item into the prefabs just to clean this up a bit because we are we do have a lot of stuff in here and I also have a main level 1 folder I don't know why it's there but we should definitely delete it okay so I know standard assets particle systems and then prefabs you should see a fire complex prefab and that's what I want to use again if you don't have this simply run I click in the project panel go import package and then particle systems and you can make sure that it's imported there but for now we are just going to whoops not prefabs be using it here and let's take it and drag it into the scene and let's find it here let's reset that in the inspector and yep so that's cool and we can delete this script here that is currently missing we don't need that and I don't think we need to multiply this I actually like the default look so that's fine and you can go ahead and select the different particle systems to see them playing or we could just go ahead and hit the play button kind of to see what this file looks like and you can see it has this really nice realistic look where the light is animated in such a way that's actually done using a script that it both varies in intensity and moves around to give a very cool looking a lively fire effect so what we are going to do here is first off we are going to boost the range of this light to something like 10 and I don't think we need to edit the color or the intensity so we'll just leave those as is and then we can um what we basically want to do is we want to flip this effect on its head because we wanted to appear that the fire is coming from beneath these obstacles so let's go ahead and bring this over to one of the obstacles and we can do that by dragging it under one of the flying platforms and then resetting the transform once again so you can see now it's centered on there and we can maybe move this down a bit and we'll just drag it actually let's just have it be part of the platform for now that's fine so we'll bring it to the very bottom of on the platform and then we'll go and look at on the different effects so when it comes to the light actually let's move the whole thing down so that we assure that when the light moves it doesn't go up into the actual platform and then we can move all of the other effects up as we want to so this actual fire effect almost look looks perfect just as is I really like the glowing effect here and it's fine that it rises we can go ahead and just flip the direction on this actually I really like that so let's just have that be flipped and that's fine and then we can find our flames and these are the ones that we definitely need to edit so let's flip the direction on the 90 degrees there however you can sit still our goes upwards and that's because we need to flip it in here as well so the start rotation here let's make that a constant add on 90 a 180 degrees so you can see that flipped it on its head and now we just need to move it down and also we need to remove the gravity modifier so that it stays in place and now we can move it up so that it fits something like that looks pretty nice I don't want any clipping to occur so just move it below so don't doesn't clip into the platform and I think this looks really great as always spend more time on this than I do please to make it look just right but I don't have infinite time when it comes to modifying this stuff we do need to get on with the tutorial so let's select the eye darksmoke here and that's kind of a crazy effect we have going on here and I actually really like it as is but I think we should maybe move it down a bit just a tad and we'll maybe see the start road and the rotation is actually kind of nice if we flip that 90 degrees I'll go crazy but I actually like that I think it's pretty good what we can also do is go into the force over lifetime and make it not rise up as quickly so bump the Y value down nope I want that to stay but we can maybe do a negative one here I don't want it to just go right on through our surface okay I think we'll keep the original value then it's probably better and then we can take the C value here Z value and bump it down to 0.5 so it doesn't look as crazy I actually kind of like that and we can take the emission and run that down as well so it isn't as crazy something like that looks really nice and we do need to do the same thing with the lit smoke that's this one we can pretty much do that by I think we might be able to just rotate it ah so now it just goes straight up and then we want to rotate it on the whatever here so that's just rotated manually so it follows the other smoke here I think that looks pretty great actually and we can add a okay we'll just use the force of a lifetime and I'll just remove the C value see what that does actually really like that so it there is some wind to it I think that looks kind of cool we'll just keep that in there we can maybe move it over a bit there okay so again spend more time but for now we'll be happy with this maybe move it down a bit as well actually it's more the dark smoke that we need to move down something like that okay cool so we're happy with that and then we'll find the sparks falling here and we want to rotate those as well to just point straight down so I'll just do a zero on the xaxis there and I really like the feel of these however I want them to go slower so let's do something like point point two on the gravity modifier I think that looks really really cool and the sparks rising we don't want them to go straight through but I definitely want to have some sparks rising so what we'll do is we'll add some kind of maybe we'll just flip those somehow change the start speed here to be a constant we can add some speed to those something like that and we can do negative 90 to make them follow our smoke and so it will really appear that the wind is blowing here so I actually really like that however I think it's too much when it comes to the emission so you can go in here and change the curve or we could just on change let's see here that's actually going here and find the curve of this come on on time for some reason it doesn't want to open up my curve editor here that's kind of annoying that's okay what we can do instead is we can simply bump down the color here so we can lessen the Alpha a little bit and I think this will give kind of the effect that we are going for something like that just to not make it as apparent okay I really like that I think that works just fine and again play more around with it now we can take this fire complex and we can duplicate it a bunch of times and move it over to the other platforms as well so I'm just going to snap to the top view here shift to on or auto graphic and move that over there I believe that's flying platform no that's actually that one over there so we'll move that over there duplicated flying platform 3 that's that one so let's move it over there as well I'm doing it this way so that we can preserve the Y positioning and that over to platform 4 which is hopefully that one over there that's perfect coal and the naming here pretty much doesn't matter so we'll have all of those in there and now when we should switch back into our perspective mode and hit play this looks super cool so I really like the effect that we have going here I really like how it's it's very clear with the wind and all of that good so we can save that and on the next thing on list is dust particles are oh actually I wanted to create a hover animation I think you should go ahead and do this yourself because we will run out of time if I need to go in and do this but it is as basic as finding our animation window right here and then adding a new animation clip and simply animating these platforms on the why it's not too difficult it should definitely be doable and what I also do is I'll shift these a bit in height I think that will look cool if we just have them be random Heights here so something like that that looks better okay and then have them hover up and down that would be just to be awesome and your of course stuff definitely free to add obstacles in here I've purposefully made this a very open arena with not a lot of stuff in it so you can go go crazy with um with designing the gameplay on your own yeah so some test particles and these are very easy to add as well let's find the dust storm prefab again under the standard acid particle systems simply drag that in here and I think this is a prefab that looks very cool just right off the bat we'll just change a few settings so it isn't as large so I will find the shape here and make that something like 40 by 40 or 40 by maybe five by 40 that's 50 40 and let's see just in which direction we made our flames blow in the air here so let's see where was it there so let's find our smoke and our sparks there okay so it went in this direction here so I definitely want our particles to go in the same direction and right now I believe yeah they're going in the pretty much opposite direction so let's do a knot on the X let's do this on the Y of 180 on that and maybe just correct it a tiny bit something like that looks a lot better we can also move it over and let's bump down the admission on this to something like forty maybe let's go back into the arena see what it looks like in here I think it gives a really nice feel however I don't want this to affect the gameplay so we'll just drag it up over the game actual gameplay area or over above the ground at least so that down here you won't be affected by the dust underneath if you look up it becomes very clear that that is definitely a thing so I think that looks pretty cool and I just want to change the color of this to tinned it a tiny bit orange ah there and in here there we go I think that looks really really awesome so we'll just keep that in there and have that playing all the time and we also want to check pre won't run prewarm on that so that it is going just when we play the game and the next thing on our list and this is a crazy list I'm just going to have a sip of water our image effects hmm and you can pretty much go completely crazy with image effects you can add a color correction you can add a vignette you can add chromatic aberration now all kinds of stuff but I'm just going to add what I think are the two most essential image effects for making your game look a lot cooler without the user thinking wow this is edited this almost looks like he went into Photoshop and play around with all the colors without it being too distracting and unity of course again has some nice standard assets when it comes to this let's import them by going by right clicking import package and then going effects and it's going to process all them here that's it import and there are a bunch of different effects in here you can pretty much add effects all you want it has a really nice vignette and chromatic aberration if that's and the effect that you're going for and I'm just going to find my scene camera here and edit this and let's bring up the art game view so we can see this applied and the first thing that I want to add is screen space ambient occlusion and also called ssao and this is just a very nice image effect that fakes ambient occlusion by looking pretty much at what the screen is seeing so it's it's adding this into the render pod line instead of rendering it into a light map or baking it into a light map beforehand so it's it's adding it real time so therefore it is a bit of an expensive effect but I think it's so worth it when you when you see it so I'm just going to search for screen space ambient and you want occlusion not obscure in so occlusion here and you can see the nice shadows that this adds it adds shadows wherever to objects or surfaces meet and we definitely want to edit that this a bit we are going to bump down the radius to something a lot smaller here something like um I don't know there looks pretty good the occlusion attends intensity I think is fine it is a pretty high intensity but that's alright so let's just have it be some something like that looks pretty nice and you can of course see it in the scene view so let's just cover this component and add it to a player camera as well so paste the component that's new there and on the player will also add a motion blur and we want that called the one called camera motion blur and I really like the default settings on this one so when we hit play now and jump in here with our character and I think this is the first time we're moving around you can see that we have this these cool shadows and we have the nice effects I actually think the dust storm is just a bit too much and everything else looks really nice and you can see that we can hit everything we can fly past this grid and we are able to fly on top of obstacles so let's let's just try that real quick and you can see there and I was able to fly on top of it even though I kind of failed at it so you can see if we can stand on top of this and everything looks cold so I'm actually really happy with that so we'll keep that I will just go in here and bump the emission on the dust storm down to something like thirty and maybe bring the color down just a bit on the Alpha here you can do that something like that I think that's better we can also take it find it in in our scene here on a dust storm and maybe move it up even a bit more here just so it's an effect to see when we look up and that's perfect and let's go back here and the last thing that we want to do is just set a couple of spawn points inside of our arena that make sense so let's find our first spawn point here that's currently right here and I actually think that that's a fine place for us to spawn but I just want to let's see Center it on the X there and everything else looks fine the second spawn point is over here that's fine as well oops that is centered on the X and we can just move it over here cool and I just want to create a couple more I want to create spawn point three here alright let's actually move this on top of one of the platforms let's Center it out in this on the platform there that looks good let's move it over drag it on top there we go I think that looks really nice and the fourth one here will just position add a nother part of the map just to make it or to confuse the players so they aren't able to just camp one spawn point that would be annoying especially when the map is this small and what you want to do is of course add some obstacles in here to duck behind and maybe have some of the spawn points be behind those obstacles so the so that the players aren't shut immediately after they spawn but I think that will be just fine and I believe that the way that we have said it set up here is that um it will automatically include include those two that we just added so that was the entire list I hope you were able to follow me in all of this stuff I really think on the prod or er the final arena here looks super cool and you should definitely play around with it it's again completely free for you to use so yep that's pretty much it thank you so much to some mean iben for creating this arena it's a amazing job if you want to order on other your arm models he does do client work his are not expensive and he is very kind so I definitely recommend him he's my goto modeler and without further ado thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video thank you so much to all of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in July and a special thanks to vixen Minnesota and UK and Lux game TV these videos wouldn't be possible without you
