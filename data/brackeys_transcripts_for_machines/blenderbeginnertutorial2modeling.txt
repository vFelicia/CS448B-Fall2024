in this video we'll have a look at the basics of modeling and blender will be making this low poly barrel but you should be able to take the same techniques and apply them to a variety of different objects let's get into it so for now we're not going to be needing either our light or our cubes let's go ahead and remove those we can then add in a new cylinder and when we first add objects into a scene we have a few possibilities down here what I want to do is go ahead and change our vertice count to 16 this gives more of that low poly look and let's hit 5 to go into out of graphic mode now so far we've only been dealing with objects in object mode object mode is used to control properties for an entire object and to switch between objects however most of modeling is actually done inside of edit mode you can change between object mode and edit mode down here or you can toggle between them by using tab as you can see when we enter edit mode the mesh meaning the geometry of our object becomes visible our object is made up of vertices which are these points edges which is the lines between points and faces which is everything in between you can switch between selecting vertices edges and faces down here so if we go back to viewing everything from the front and we click on vertex select we can always deselect whatever recurring you have selected by hitting a and if you have nothing selected it's going to select everything so in our case here we want to go ahead and scale it up on the set axis so we'll hit s and then Li and drag it up a bit I want to make it so that our barrel is a bit wider at the center than at the top and bottom but we don't currently have any vertices that we can change here in other words we need to add more geometry to our mesh luckily you can easily subdivide our mesh further by hitting ctrl R and if we then use the scroll wheel we can choose how many subdivisions we want in our case that's just add 2 you can also just go ahead and press the 2 key if we then leftclick we're able to slide these loops up and down on our model if you just want them to be on the center we right click so now we've added some extra geometry and we can go ahead and scale this up using the S key let's just scale it up a tiny bit let's then hit a to deselect and our barrel now looks much more like a barrel we can always go and adjust the shape of these loops afterwards to do that we could press the B key in order to back select and select all of these vertices however here is a common pitfall because if I now go ahead and rotate our view you can see that we've I only selected the visible vertices and not those on the other side that means if we were to go ahead and scale this we would get a really weird shape to get around this we go back to the front view and we change to wireframe we can actually toggle between solid and wireframe by hitting Z now if we were to select these edges again you can see that it selects all the way through to both sides and so we can select all of them and scale them up more if we wanted to next up I want to make the top and bottom of our barrel but specifically I want to extrude the top a bit inwards if we want to select all of the vertices along the top here we could shift into side view hit Z hit B and then select all of them and that definitely works but I find that an easier way is simply holding down alt and right clicking this way blender will automatically detect the loop and select all the vertices in it now you might think here that all we need to do is scale it inwards but you can see that doesn't give us the effect that we want instead we want to use extrude to extrude we hit the e key and now we've added some extra geometry at our endpoint here that we can then go and extrude out but we don't want this to exterior doubt we want this to extrude inwards so what we do is right click this doesn't cancel the extrude it's still there if we try and move it it just places it on top of the original face and if we now hit the S key and scale it in we can see that loop appearing if we then hit the e key once more and this time only extrude along the zaxis and then drag it down we get that barrel lurking lid of course we've currently only done this on the top and not on the bottom we could go down here and do it on the bottom as well if you want it to be totally symmetrical we could do them both at the same time or we could use mirroring now this is a pretty cool feature if we snap to the front view going to wireframe hit ctrl R to add a subdivision loop we only want to add a single one so let's leftclick and let's rightclick to add it in the center we then deselect it B to bug select the bottom ones X to remove them and we want to remove all of the vertices what we can now do is switch into object mode go over here to the modifiers panel hit add modifier and you can do all sorts of things to generate extra geometry or modify our model in a bunch of ways we'll select the mirror modifier and we want to mirrored a along the axis and will allow now any change that we make to our model in edit mode will be reflected on the other side and when you're satisfied with your model just go ahead and exit out of edit mode and hit apply now I also want to make some metallic rings to go around our barrel to do that that's it shift a to create a new mesh let's also make this a cylinder that's it these that we can see it in wireframe mode that's it tap to go into edit mode that scale this up so that it's just a tad bigger than our barrel and let's scale it down on the z axis to make it thinner we can then go ahead and grab this and move it up to the top of our barrel then we can duplicate it and move it down on the z axis to the bottom of our barrel now if we go back to object mode and to solid view we can see that we have two rings around our barrel now we created these in object mode and that means that they're currently subject objects from our barrel now this may be something that you want if you only want some barrels to have these then it's a good thing there is separate object by now case they're pretty integral part of our model and so it makes sense to combine them to do that we first click on the Rings hold down shift and click on the barrel and to join them we hit ctrl J as you can see in our outliner they are now just one object and we'll also go ahead and rename this object to barrel finally let's go under your material hit new and let's add a brown material to this something like that this is going to be of wood material we of course want our metal rings to be offer a separate material so what we'll do is go into edit mode let's select our two rings by holding down alt and shift to select all of the edge loops then going up here and adding a new material let's hit new and to assign this material to these vertices we hit the assign button now out of edit mode and we can choose a color for these metal pans and there we go we can switch back into perspective mode and have a look at our first barrel model and for good measures sake let's just rename this material to rings so congratulations let's say my files are going to file save as or hitting ctrl s I'm just going to call mine barrel and hit save as bender file that's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe so don't miss the next
