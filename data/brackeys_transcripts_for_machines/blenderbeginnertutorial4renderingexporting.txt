in this video we'll have a look at how you can set up lights and materials for blend recycles in order to create a cool looking render for those of you interested in game development we'll also have a look at how you can export the model and import it into Unity so let's get into it so let's begin by making a cool render of a barrel to do that we first want to go to the top here and change from blender render to Cycles Render Cycles is blender's rate Trace based render engine it's been a part of blender for quite some time now and it's really awesome the first thing we want to do is go ahead and switch into material mode here and as you can see when we switched to Cycles we lost our textures that's because Cycles has a whole different way of defining materials we go to the materials tab now we still have our two materials but you can see down here that we have this big button called use nodes that's because blend it allows us to create custom materials using a nodebased system to do that let's first split our view by going to the top here and dragging out let's then change this view into the node editor and let's get rid of this panel now there's currently nothing on the grid and that's because this material isn't using notes we can either hit use notes here or down here and now two nodes will appear we can see that we have a material output this is where we want all of our data to end and we have a diffuse node this allows us to give our object a color and blender will then automatically calculate Lighting on that model using a diffuse Shader the diffuse Shader determines the general color of a material when light shines on it and you can see we can choose a color here but instead of using a simple color we want to use use a texture as our color data to do that we hit shift a to add a new node and the node that we want to add is a texture node and we want to use an image texture because remember we created an image in Photoshop and so we want to reference that let's place our note somewhere on the screen I'm going to place it out here let's open the texture on our system so let's it open and the texture is called barrel.png then instead of using a Syle color here will take our image textures color and Link it into our color Channel and as you can see you can now see the texture on the object now of course the Rings are currently using a separate material we should go in here and do the same thing for this one let's hit use notes and we could put the texture in here as well but since we're just using a single color on the texture we might as well Define it in here however I want to add a bit of shine onto these rings to do that let's hit shift a create another Shader this one is going to be the glossy Shader and as the name might suggest this adds glass into our object and here we have a problem because we can either take the output of our diffuse Shader and put it into our material output or the output of our glass but we want a mix between them so what we do is go in here and add yet another Shader and this time we add the mix Shader this allows us to blend multiple shaders together so if I go ahead and move this into the middle we can have our glass Shader go into the bottom Shader our diffuse Shader go into the top one and this value then determines the blend between them I want to take our glossy Shader here and definitely darken it a bit as well so now we should see that when we start adding lights to our scene the Rings look more metallic and glossy than the wood cool so now that we're satisfied with our materials let's go ahead and right click here hit join area and let's click on the right in order to close our node editor and let's have a look at adding lights so what a lot of people assume is that in order to add lights into our render we go shift a we go on lamp and we add one of the lights in here however these lights are actually used in the blender render engine and not for Cycles in Cycles we have a much more realistic approach to lighting that means that in order to create a light we first make a surface that should emit light and we then apply an emissive material to that so in our case let's go ahead and hit shift a add in a plane we can rotate this plane on the X by about 12 120Â° we then move it out on the Y here I'm going to shift to the top view by hitting numpad 7 moving this over to the side rotating it around the zaxis and definitely scaling it up so now we have a surface that we can use to emit line onto our Barrel first let's go down here and change our preview to rendered as we can see there's currently no lights in our scene so with our plane selected let's go and hit new and the material we want to use is not diffuse but emission and as you can see it's currently casting a tiny bit of light onto our Barrel let's go ahead and bump this up to something like 14 and there we go we have light in our scene now this is of course a bit boring let's switch into material mode and add some more we'll call this one the main light and we'll rename the object to the same thing let's duplicate it by hitting shift d and let's move it over here on the other side let's switch to the top view and actually move it a bit behind the barrel let's also rotate it around the zaxis and rotate it forward now I want this light to be different and therefore we want to create another material what a lot of people do is go in here now and adjust the strength and the color but as you can see that actually changes for both the lights because they're both using the same material called mainl so we want to go in here and hit the plus this is going to add a new material with the same base settings and we want to call this backlight we then bump down the strength to say eight and set the color to a more bluish tone we can see what that looks like in our render so this could definitely be more blue cool and I actually want to go ahead and add one more light this is a very standard way of lighting a model it's called threepoint lighting we have our main light which is also the strongest one emitting either a neutral or warm color and this is placed forward and a bit to the side then at the back have another light this is called the back light or the rim light this has a more bluish tone and a smaller strength then we normally have another light in the front so I'm going to duplicate on Main light switch to the top view here and move it over it's also rotated and this is much similar to the main light but it's not as strong let's go and make a copy of the material let's call this material secondary light and let's set the strength here to something around 10 so now when we switch to rendered mode we can see that we have nice and even Lighting on our model and we have a bit of color detail at the edge because of our Rim light now we can go ahead and add a ground plane so let's hit shift a mesh plane let's grab this and move it on the zaxis to place it at the bottom of our Barrel let's then scale it up let's go into rendered as we can see the plane is currently totally white let's go in here and add a new material we want this material to be H actually like the idea of this being a light orange I think we should move the ring light here over to the side a bit more and maybe also rotate it to point more towards our barrel and if we switch into top view also o think we should take our secondary light and move it back a bit let's now position our view where we want it switch into rendered mode and let's snap our camera to a view to do that we go view align View and we hit align active camera to view now it's all about finetuning a bit let's take our Rim light here and move it out even further and if you want you can select your camera go to the camera settings and here we can change the focal length so if we want to zoom out we'll make this value smaller but I like it at 35 now when we satisfied with our render let's go to our render settings I'm going to select full HD for our resolution 1920 x 1080 and I'm going to set the percentage scale for a resolution to 100% to get our max resolution I'm then going to go to where it says sampling and increase the samples for our render to something like 512 the higher you set your samples the less of this grainy effect you'll see on your image so for a preview we're only currently using 32 so I think 512 is going to be enough for render the higher the samples the more the rendering time so keep that in mind and with all those settings let's go ahead and hit render now depending on the complexity of your scene and the settings you've chosen this can take some time I'll see you when it's done and I think it looks awesome so if you're not satisfied with your render you can hit f11 make the changes you need and simply hit the render button once more I'm going to hit f11 again because I like my render and to save it I'm going to go to image and hit save as image I'm going to call it Barrel render and hit save so now you should have a nice Barrel render PNG image that you can send over to your friends or I'm also going to go into blender and hit file save as and save this as a separate file called Barrel render it's a good idea to keep multiple versions going so exporting the object is actually really simple the first thing that we want to go ahead and do is delete our camera and any other objects you might have in the scene we only want the object that we want to export we can then select a barrel go under the materials panel and let's remove all but one material let's rename this material to Barrel we can do this because all of our materials are using the same Tech and have the same settings and so we actually only need one material for this object if your object needs more materials well then simply leave all them in here a really nice thing to do when exporting for games is to make sure that your pivot is set correctly in the case of a barrel we could definitely put this at the center of our object but personally I would prefer if the pivot was at the bottom so that we could simply drag it onto our ground to do that we shift into edit mode select all of our object switch into front mode and orthographic I'm then going to grab it and move it up on the Z until it just rests on the center point when we then switch out of edit mode we can see that our pivot is now at the bottom so let's save our scene and to export an object let also go file export fbx fbx is pretty much the standard file format for exporting models it's good because it's supported by a whole lot of programs and it stores pretty much all the data we need anywhere from the meesh of our object to UVS to material data to rigging and animation so fpx is awesome let's just call this one barrel. fpx X and hit export if you now navigate to where you've exported your file we should see that we have both the barrel. blend and the barrel. fbx along of course with our texture the cool thing about Unity is that we can actually use the blender file directly we don't even need to export to fbx but a lot of software do need you to do that so now you know how I'm now going to close down blender select the blend file and the texture and drag both of them into the unity project that I have opened by the way if you want to get started with game development or just learn how to use Unity I have a course specifically for you check it out it's on the screen now as you can see it's imported both our Barrel model and our texture and it's gone ahead and automatically created a Unity material as well called Barrel now we simply need to drag our model into the scene and it's working but it's currently looking a bit weird the reason for this is that we often have to configure a few settings inside of our engine so let's select the barrel material and the first thing we want to do here is change the color to white otherwise we'll apply a tint on top of our texture and we just want to use the texture as is we'll also take the smoothness and set it down to zero to give us that flat low poly look and now we have it we now have our Barrel inside of our scene and we can use it as we want for our game you will notice that there's currently an animator component attached to it that's a bit weird because we don't have any animation on the object to get rid of that we'll just select the model go under rig hit none and hit apply and voila it's gone finally and this is probably the coolest thing about using blender and unity together if we thought hey there's something about this we want to change say we wanted to stretch the top part a bit all we need to do is double click on the model file it will automatically open the file up in blender we can now go in here and make all of the changes that we want we can save them and when we now hit into Unity it automatically updates it's just awesome so that's pretty much it for this video and the entire series I've covered all of the fundamental blender stuff that I wanted to cover of course you can do so much more in blender than what is showed in these videos I'll have some links in the description to where I can find some more blender tutorials and to those of you who want to create a character for your game check out Sebastian L's videos on character creation in blender and of course make sure to subscribe to this channel if you guys want to see more blender videos let me know especially if there's a certain topic that you want me to cover and to those of you who are worried that I won't be doing Unity tutorials do not worry I love unity and I won't stop using it anytime soon so thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed the series and I will see
