on this channel I talk a lot about making games but rarely about playing them in this video I'm gonna walk you through my alltime favorite games made with unity these are games that I personally really enjoyed playing and some of them are iconic games that I feel have made an impact on the games industry so I hope you'll enjoy my picks of favorite games and without further ado let's jump right into it now let's begin with inside this is a game that's all about atmosphere the game acknowledges this by putting you straight into the game world right as you open it there's no UI no tutorial a menu to disturb the experience the players presented only with the main character and the surrounding environment amazingly you're never in doubt what your objective is and what tools you have at your disposal the main instrument in establishing this atmosphere is the amazing sound design when playing the game the world feels large and abandoned most of the time the only sounds you hear are from the main character himself another game that uses great sound design to establish atmosphere is Ori and the blind forest however unlike inside this game benefits from a very clear musical soundtrack with lots of layers and instruments the environments in Ori and the blind forest are riddled with details and colors the characters are beautiful the levels are interesting and vibrant but the main strength of the game is its gameplay the controls are smooth and the mechanics of both deep and plentiful I feel pretty comfortable saying that Ori and the blind forest is the best 2d platformer I've ever played and speaking of platformers I have to mention Thomas was alone least back in 2012 this game marked one of the first great platformers made with unity much like Ori and the blind forest the game features both a beautiful soundtrack and interesting gameplay but the visual style of the game couldn't be more different it's strikingly simple one of the main elements of the game is the clever and often goofy narration the glowy white thing only could get to it which of course made it all the more interesting to me Thomas was alone stands as a symbol of how much you can do with something so simple another game that I simply love is hearthstone made by none other than Blissett themselves the game shares that certain level of quality and refinement that I personally associate with other Blizzard titles every time you open up hearthstone it offers a rich complete experience every animation every sound effect every illustration on every card is beautiful and when you bring all these details together you get a game which creates a wondrous and vibrant medieval setting the gameplay is fun and competitive in a direct and easy way so yeah you can probably tell that I'm a huge Blizzard fan and hearthstone did not let me down now let's talk about cuphead you only need to take one quick look at the game to know what makes it so unique inspired by cartoons from the 1930s cup hits art style is extremely refreshing I mean how can you not like this menu this art style mix with the run and gun gameplay from the 90s makes for a very original experience the game is also immensely difficult and can definitely be frustrating at times but I think the clever bus design and attention to detail makes it all worth it finally you can't talk about hot unity games without it getting the games key feature is the time moves with your player this brings a new dimension to the FPS genre as the game focuses more on dodging your opponent's bullets rather than spraying them you still need to shoot your enemies which can be difficult enough but the main challenge is to evade bullets coming from all angles one again the menu is just awesome last but not least I want to mention cities skylines oh well this game is really impressive just the sheer amount of content they've managed to put in there is amazing and to think they did all that with just two programmers I really loved how deep this game is you have to consider all possible aspects about the development of a city this is definitely the best city building game I've played today so that's pretty much my list of alltime favorite games made with unity there are so many great ones that it was really difficult to pick some to focus on here's some other ones I really like of course there are plenty of unique games that I haven't played yet which I'm really looking forward to such as Kerbal space program Monument Valley and Firewatch I hope you enjoyed this video and if you haven't checked out some of these games I definitely recommend you do so feel free to share your favorite unity games in the comment on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks of
