Thanks for tuning in at Brackeys Hello, everyone and [welcome] to the first video in how to program in [C] sharp This course is going to be quite different from what I normally do which is game development tutorials but I've been getting a lot [of] requests on making a course that really focuses on the CSharp language and this is super awesome, because it will allow us to really give an Introduction to what programming means and reading and writing an understanding code whilst learning a language That can pretty much be used for any kind of software development whether you want to do web development whether you want to develop for PC or Mac or Game development or a mobile app development Csharp pretty much does it all by now So CSharp is super cool and we can really focus on the language and understanding it so what we are going to be doing today as First off what can see shop do we just went through that then we're going to be talking about console applications What is an IDE we're going to install the software [we're] going to be using throughout the [course] and we're going to create our first project If all of this seems very easy and fundamental [to] you Please just go ahead and skip onto the next video where we will delve into the programming side So first off let me explain What kind of software we are going to be writing in this course? So we're going to be making what is called console applications? And if you don't know what this is there's an image on the screen right now [I] agree with you [that] it does not look very appealing but it's great for really focusing on the general language because it's not so specific on Game development tools or mobile app tools or anything it's it's a lot of language but not much api so the api stands for application programming Interface, and it's basically a series of commands that you can use so game development uses some one kind of Api and other software development uses other kinds of Api s So that's a really simplified very way of looking at it by light. I think it will work for now so an Ide also sounds really frightening? It is really not it stands for integrated development environment, and it's basically just a software that you [use] to programming so if if you're in a video Editor you might use premiere pro or sony Vegas and if you're a programmer you might might use visual studio xcode Or what we are going to be using which is [monodevelop], and it's even an extended version of monodevelop called Xamarin studio, so when you learn this you can also do app development right after so we're going to be using mono develop and in an extended version called Xamarin studio [just] so you know. They [are] basically the [same] thing just don't get them confused You just need to know that they might use [different] naming sometimes so let's dive [right] into it and Install our first Ide so let's head over to our browser and let's open up Monodevelop Com let's hit download now to download the file But first we have to say select an operating system So if you're on Mac click that and make sure you first install this package down here which will download the mono framework plus [gtK] what these does is not important for now? But you need them so download them and install them and then right after you can download and install monodevelop itself But we [own] windows, so we're going to select that and here you will need to first install gtK [for.net] and then the Dotnet framework So download both of them and install them and then right after we can download the installer itself So I'm going to hit download and it will start downloading and you can see now. It's not cold Mono develop anymore now It's called Summer in studio. So that's why I wanted to clear [that] up so when it's downloaded simply open it and We will run [installer] here. I'm just going to change my directory because I have a secondary hard disk and [sh] I would rather you have it sit on so [exam] [or] in studio Let's say it okay next and it's going to install the reason why we hit Yes here the reason why we're using summer in studio is because it's cross platform. Which is really awesome [visual] studio is only [four] four windows. It's made by Microsoft and xcode is only for Mac, and it's made by apple, and they're both good takes, but I mean for what we're going to be doing here Which is console applications samer in studio is going to be more than enough? so hit launch summer in studio and hit finish and It might go ahead and prompt you here to update it often [just] pops up and say hey there's some updates Do you want to install and simply just hit install and restyle? I think it's called and and you will be good to go. It's always great to keep your software updated So we're going to go ahead and click new Solution and solutions are basically like projects if you think of them in that respect, so let's hit new solution and We are going to be making a console project in the CSharp language, so let's hit a hit undo Csharp click on the CSharp Category we can also do f sharp or VB net or I'll do stuff and then hit console project And when you have the selected we are going to do a name so let's call this first console project and we're just going to keep the solution name the same as the name and I'm just going to change the location to [be] on the desktop and Let's hit create directory for solution And let's hit ok let's actually do solution name first console project Solution just so we keep them separate because you can have several projects under one solution There it's not really important for this tutorial, but let's just name it correctly from the beginning, it's not good to teach bad habits, so let's hit ok and It will start creating our project and now this right here is our first CSharp program so this here is CSharp it might look very frightening and difficult to understand at this very moment But in the next video we are going to go through everything explain it We're going to write some code ourself, and we're going to launch our first console program, so that's going to be really awesome [I] hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am It's always fun to play around with these console apps, and yeah, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
