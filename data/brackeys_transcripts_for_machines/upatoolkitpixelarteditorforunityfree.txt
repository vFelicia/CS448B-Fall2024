thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to maybe the most exciting video I've done in quite some time so the last couple of weeks I've been working on an editor extension for unity and it just went live on the unity asset store the editor extension is called unity pixel art toolkit and it makes it fast and easy to create pixel art sprites without leaving the comfort of unity so if you need to efficiently and and quickly create some pixel art now you don't even have to leave unity you can just do it inside of unity itself so you whoops UPA toolkit is currently available for free on the unity asset store and it currently requires unity 4.6.1 or higher and that's the current version as of the recording of this video but I've just submitted a update that makes it compatible all the way back to unity 4.3 so once that gets approved it should be updated here and then you guys with with a lower version can use it too but enough set for now I will also quickly say that it's available on github and encourage you to leave a review because it really helps out with getting noticed on the asset story if you guys leave a hopefully positive review but that's of course up to you any review is better than and nothing so I've rambled on way too much let's get started so if you click on the link in the description or just go to the asset store and search for uph toolkit you can see browse to it and open up in unity simply click that button there and I've already imported it and all that it won't take long it's it's under one megabyte the entire toolkit so it's very fast to download once you've downloaded it you will notice that you have this new folder you paid to a kit and inside of this is the entire extension we have a readme that dark with some documentation on how to get started and some some some stuff about the get up page and also the shortcuts if you want to move faster throughout the UI and then also all of the csharp scripts and the toolkit is written entirely in csharp and all the code is of course publicly available so you can just change anything you want and if you want to redistribute or help me develop this this at this extension I suggest you check out the github page and have a look at the license file there is also a a guide on how to contribute to the project if you want me to improve on this because there are of course still improvements to be way made this is still version 1.0 I'm showing you so keep that in mind cool now let's get started with creating a pixel art sprite so to do this let's go to window and you will notice that that is now a new tab called pixel ID editor or simply press ctrl shift P you're going to click that and let's just dark this up here by the scene and game tabs and you can see that I've made my UI ready for painting so we have this huge area for painting which is really nice then I'm going to go ahead and click a new image it's going to pop up with a dialog where I can change the resolution width it's going to be 16 and the height is also going to be 16 now we create and you can name and place your image anywhere you want this is not the final image file this is the project file sort of say and I'm going to name this mushroom because I'm going to be creating the mushroom from Mario that we all love now hit save and you can see that it opens up this canvas here on this empty canvas that where the eye almost entirely white cells represent what is currently transparent and you can see we have this toolbar where we can zoom in and out or using these buttons we can open other images or create new ones or expert when we done select the color we have three tools paint erase and you will notice if we click box fill this is currently in development I'm working as hard as I can on that then we can use WASD or the up and down arrow keys to navigate if that's what you want is simply centered on the view and then we can switch between black and white gridlines so if you're making something that is quite black you can change this to white cool so I'm just going to go ahead and quickly paint on some stuff here and I'm going to speed through it and I'll see you when I'm done you okay so I'm done with creating my mushroom here I think it looks quite like the Mario games and now I can simply hit export up here it's going to select itself then we can change the save as type notice that if you save as a JPEG you will lose transparency and this also requires 4.5 to work so most of the time I don't see in the reason why you wouldn't use PNG but the option is there and then we have the texture type where you can simply change between a sprite which the fourpointthree system uses where texture if you want to apply it to a game object now we can simply hit export and we can change where we want to save this or whatever I'm simply going to save it under the assets folder and I call it mushroom now it's save and you will notice that our mushroom appears down here and it set up all the import settings so it works with pixel art you can of course change the pixels per unit the pivot point on that if you're not satisfied one thing you will have to do in this current version is change it from compressed to true color just to make sure that the colors I write if not they might look a bit odd and that's something I'm going to change it to do automatically of course in a version to come so now we can simply go into the scene view and the project here I mean is the one from the 2d platformer series so check that out if you're interested and then we can simply drag it into our scene and there you go you've created a pixel add sprite that you can use inside your scene like any other object we could maybe add a fixed physics component here rigidbody and a circle Collider and he'll play and you will notice that it simply just works it will fall to the ground here we could push it over and it's part of the scene and if we want to make any changes and this is where the system here becomes incredibly useful we simply go back to the pixel art editor make the change we want let's say we want something in here to be blue don't know why we would do this but we're doing it like we can simply hit export again export and just override it and now it's updated in the scene view and it will wake so it's so so fast and easy to do of course if you want to do more advanced stuff you can also use this PNG just open it up in Photoshop if you want to do if you think a tool is missing or something but really if you have any features you want to request go to the brackets forum go to the github page I should be possible to reach and I really want to know what you guys would like this tool to be and how you would like to see it grow in the future so thanks for watching this introduction video to UPA toolkit version 1.0 I hope you enjoyed it and please again leave a review it helps out a lot I've shared this asset for free in hopes that it will reach as many people as possible and maybe makes their lives a tiny bit easier so just leave a review it it's it's crazy how much it helps so again thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video
