sal√πte entire 838 just got wrapped up and the review process has now started if you don't know Ludum dare is a huge game development competition where you get 48 hours to create a game from scratch using only adding code you make yourself as always the theme was announced in the middle of the night so when I woke up I was stoked to see that my favorite one had been selected the theme was small world so I quickly pulled out the whiteboard and started sketching out ideas I thought about making a 2d planet with changing terrain that the player would have to pass by and a city building game with way too little space to build on I ended up scrubbing both ideas however I decided to stick with the theme of using a small planet as the game world the player controlling a red car would then drive around the planet trying to avoid meteors and to up the difficulty the planet would get smaller and smaller over time with this idea in mind that created a todo list and finally it was time to boot up unity I quickly got some controls up and running but for some reason that just couldn't get them to feel right I tried a number of solutions but kept on getting either jittery movement back collision emphasized controls weird camera movement and the list went on finally I ended up using a mix of rigidbody gravity calculation and quaternion that rotate to apply input driven rotation on top of that satisfied with the movement I jumped into blender to replace the default sphere with a smoother one creating the meatiest went really quickly I'd already implemented gravity and so it was just a matter of using random deadon units for you to spawn meteors at random points around the planet a non collision energy a place a creator where they hit also made the planet shrink over time but then created a first shader using a tutorial by Elin Ciccone and tweaked it to be used for grass I generated a grass texture in Photoshop played around with the lighting a bit and added a gradient background after that I did some postprocessing mainly the motion blur helped emphasize the action I created some particle effects for the meteors being able to add noise to the particles made them look so much cooler and finally to finish the graphics overhaul I modeled a quick crater in blender happy with the look of the game so far I went to bed at around 200 a.m. after I could not sleep I felt ready to work on the car now I really suck at modeling but I think from a distance it ended up looking just fine at least after I blew it up I now felt it was time to add a score counted to the game I thought it would be fun to have UI elements follow the planet so I made it interpolate towards the center as the planet shrunk in fact I liked the effect so much that I decided to do the same thing to the end screen now I've always been a huge Dragon Ball fan and my and it really reminded me of King Kai's so I decided to embrace it and add a single road that wraps around him the cash actually also inspired by his when it came time to making some music I felt really inspired and hop right into busker quarry I ended up creating five different soundtracks that's right five I lost two of them because I accidentally hit the Escape key I mean seriously why would that close it without warning why the other two tracks just didn't fit the vibe of the game they were too dark so for the fifth one I went for something simple and happy next I created a main menu to which I added the player controls and a cool scene transition also set up some quick sounds on the current videos and wrapped it up by creating an icon for the game I submitted it just before the deadline this is what I looked like at the end time for a bath and a shave when this time I loved the girlfriend participated for her first time you guys might know her as Sophie but from the forums she made a game about avoiding people you know on the street also she is now full time on brackets as well and has actually been doing most of the video editing the last three months so big thanks to her you'll find links to both games in the description go and play and review them all you want hope you enjoy playing them just a fraction of how much we enjoyed making them let's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe and maybe check out some of the other behind the scenes videos I've done for previous Ludum dare race other than that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in march and a special thanks to Derrick Eames Kirk face Tamara fine James Calhoun and Jason the Tito if you want to support the channel and become a picture in yourself you could do so a patron account slash brackets thanks a lot guys
