so we promised to make a video about all the stuff that is coming to unity in 2019 and the amount of features is frankly overwhelming so buckle up your info right but first this video is sponsored by sin T Studios sin T Studios is a leading acid story publisher that makes super cool stylized art packs for it game developers the packs are easy to use great for beginners and fun for prototypes and jams and frankly they are just gorgeous since he has over 70 art packs on the asset store with themes like City scifi fantasy and many more so no matter what theme you're going for these packs will help you get started for a limited time you can get 25% off using the code sent to practice 25 and this even includes their latest pack polygon scifi space I mean just look at those colors if you want to check out their stuff that's of course a link for that in the description so unity just held their official GDC keynote and here we got some exciting news one of the things that I was most excited to see was the new demo from the atom demo team it's called the heretic and it looks absolutely amazing never mind the fact that I had to look up what heretic means now I just can't wait to talk about this one so I'm gonna jump straight into it unity has partnered up with havoc which is an amazing physics engine to create an all new physics engine for unity called unity physics it's based on dots which probably means that it's going to be really performant and lightweight and it's built with networking in mind and on top of that they've also added integration with the havok physic's engine also using dots which means that we can now get to choose between unity physics and havok physic's depending on the needs of your game having been really great for more complex physics simulation also on another note realtime ray tracing is now a thing in unity with an experimental build available on April 4th the demo for this was just stunning personally I'm still a bit confused as to when this super realistic looking technology will be usable in actual game scenarios so I'm just looking forward to trying it out and seeing what it will do to future unity games also and I called it at the beginning of the stream your cube did wear the pink shirt once again that man never disappoints why did he in terms of features he talked about dots which is the new name for ECS the C shop job system and the burst compiler combined this entire tech stack is insanely powerful and he showed that it's starting to get more integrated into the editor which makes it much easier to start wrapping your head around also huge congratulations to everyone involved with the AR demo this time it went really well and I think we all know how nerveracking a live AR demo can be good job but the real Meade as always was in the roadmap talk that was held at the booth later that week here they gave a really good overview of what to expect from unity in the coming year which is also why I don't understand why they don't make this a main event luckily we went there and here's what they showed with version 2019 point 1 unity has quick search I think this is actually a really big deal since it's such a useful tool for beginners and it's one of my favorite parts about using blender so it's really nice to see this coming to unity as well as for project tiny it's currently in preview you can try it out now using the package manager timeline is getting markers that allows you to jump to a certain part of the timeline and signals which is basically like event triggers so that's really nice the SRP core and lightweight are production ready for 19.1 yay and it has the ability to create custom render passes through the editor which allows you to create really cool effects without writing code like you see here on the characters on the screen here is all the new stuff coming to HDR P in 19.1 that is just a lot and I can't wait to play with it shader graph is now getting production ready and it has nested sub graphs which makes it so much more usable in larger projects the effects graph is coming to light weight over version nineteen point one and point two postprocessing has now been integrated into HDR P along with some improved effects 2d and light weight is slowly getting more integrated with a specific 2d renderer for light weight and a 2d master node for shader graph and at this point they mentioned text mesh Pro and judging by what they showed here there are no real plans to integrate it further into the editor and haven't replaced the current system instead of what it is right now which is basically like a new system beside the old one personally I'm a bit confused by this move and we liked see texmex pro just completely replaced the old system the cinema sheen team is as always providing some solid updates throughout the year and cloth is back in the engine good to see you cloth you've been missed in the roadmap they also mentioned something called runtime animation rigging apparently this is some kind of in editor rigging I don't know but it sounds pretty cool of course they went over a lot of stuff that we've heard about before here's a list of when you can expect to see it the new input system is also finally being released as a package in 2019 point 1 I really wonder why this wasn't part of the keynote since it feels like such a huge improvement now finally we got some more information about the new multiplayer system in fact they showed this graph of the tech stack it looks pretty much as you would expect but the cool thing about the new networking system is that it's based on dots and as you can see from this slide it's still very much being built what I'm really interested to see is how this will be built into the editor will we see a similar component based approach as we did with unit or something else in terms of hosting it's powered by multiplayer which is also the tech behind apex legends titanfall and rocket League so I imagine they know what they're doing they also talked a bit about matchmaking but it seems to still like a lot of needed functionality like groups latency based matchmaking and the ability to join in progress but kudos to unity for being so transparent on this one also unity has partnered up with vivix for ingame communication which is free for up to 5,000 users so that's pretty nice now unity collaborate is also being improved which was definitely needed version 2.0 is out as a package for 19.1 with a lot of important functionality like branching coming in nineteen point three you can now also add notes to game objects and acids which sync over the cloud so that's pretty cool visual scripting has been moved to 2020 dot one of course it's too bad that will have to wait since the more here about this feature the more excited I get it's built for dots which means that it's going to be super fast and everything about it just looks delicious and so those of you who watched Google's announcement on stadia unity will be supporting it latency only time will tell so as you can see there are quite a bit of new features coming in 2019 these days a lot of features are being introduced used in a previous state which i think is really great because we get to try them out early and help improve on them however one thing that I've noticed with a couple of features is that after the initial launch development seems to slow down which is too bad because they only need the final 10% to be really their text much pro pro builder poly brush the new input system and the navmesh components have all been introduced a while back but I'm still waiting on them to be completely finished either in terms of UI or functionality I think the most important thing that got me to fall in love with unity was how everything felt like it was designed to fit together as one simple as can be tall and I think finishing these features would make sure the engine keeps being coherent and easy to use for example when you want to create a piece of text for your UI do choose text or a text text mesh pro most beginners would probably choose the ordinary text object but at this point as far as my experience goes text much pro is pretty much better in every way not just to be totally clear I love all these new features and I think they are really great which is also why I think it's so important that we give them the time and attention that they deserve hashtag terrain love please because ultimately for me at least what got me to choose unity over other alternatives like unreal wasn't the amount of features or this stateoftheart rendering it was the intuitiveness and simplicity of the tools and I think it's these qualities that has made unity so popular because they allow beginners and teams with fewer resources to make really cool and unique games however unity is giving plenty of love to a lot of features shader graph and the effects graph are outstanding and getting better every day the shuriken particle system team continues to amaze me cinema Sheen has been improved on so much since released and nested prefabs is just a really solid and great to work with system so keep it up unity now there of course a bunch of features that we haven't talked about if you want to learn more we'll have a link to the keynote as well as the release note for unity 19.1 in
