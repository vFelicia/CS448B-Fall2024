hello everyone and welcome to the official launch of tener games I've been working on this project for a while now and I'm glad to finally get it started before I explain to you exactly what ten hour games is let me explain why it's awesome you should participate in 10 hour games to inspire new developers while putting your own skills to the test many developers including myself tend to spend way too much time thinking about what games to make and how long it's going to take to make them 10 hour games is not a competition but a paper away for people to stop thinking and just get cracking on whatever game they want to make I hope that people will be able to try out a bunch of ideas and discover more efficient techniques for future projects hence the tight deadlines so 10 hour games is all about getting creative collaborating with other developers growing your skills and just having fun the rules are simple start a 10 hour countdown once development kicks off and export the final build when the timer runs out you can use any software if you're liking unity UDK game maker or whatever you can also just pause the countdown and continue at a later time as long as you stick to the ten work hours of development the idea of the event is that it's not a competition but a way for people to bring ideas to live in an entertaining and educated way though to kick things off I will feature the first five games submitted and if you make something really cool you have a chance to get featured too if you feel you have unanswered questions please visit brackish calm / 10 hour games to read more about the event you can also play my own submission at brekkie Starcom / flappy cow that was pretty much it so good luck and I'm looking very much forward to seeing what you come up with thanks you
