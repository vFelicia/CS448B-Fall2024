everyone will come to this making items video for the unity inventory system by brekkie so I'm sorry it has taking me so long to finally come out with this video but there's been a lot of demand for different kinds of series so it has been down prioritized a bit but now it's here and first off some some information the we're not going to be creating these items from scratch we're going to be making them using the free inventory system available on the unity asset store so go to brac East comm slash inventory and click the get adhere button you will also see a demo video and I also have a set up tutorial so everything should be there and also the scene I am going to be using is from the a unity survival game series so if you want to really follow along and also see how to set up the player to work with animations and damaging the opponent so that you can also switch weapons and all that you can go ahead and watch the latest survival game video which is called merely switching and new melee so you can get all of that working those two should be just right so I call let's go ahead and get started so as always I've opened up unity and here you can see just what the finished will result will look like somewhat let's just delete that and of course I'm just going to get rid of these errors so whenever you start up with the inventory system you will have a folder called inventory so let's double click that and then here we have a guide document so if we open this up you will pretty much have all the information necessary to use the inventory system so if we just scroll down here we can see a table a table of contents and we want to make some items and what we are going to be doing is we are going to use just the weapon items because there are many type of items and the weapon items are definitely the most advanced to create so once you master that you can easily do the rest so that's what I'm going to walk you through so we're going to scroll all the way down to page 5 down here where it says creating weapon items cool so first off let's read that weapon items are the most difficult to create this is because you need to create two versions basically you need to create an item version which is the one that will lie on the ground have physics it will store the icon it will it's the one we can interact with and then we have the weapon version which is basically just graphics and then maybe a weapon script if you wanted to do damage just the one that we can see and we will hold in our hands and this allows us to really be good on the computer because we don't need to disable components when we don't need a rigidbody and such we'll just have two versions cool so let's start out by creating the item version and first off we drag and muddle into our scene so I already have one here but I'll just delete it and show you how to do this so go under inventory weapons let's just use the axe you can use any one you want and drag it into the scene and there we have it so we are already on our way cool so now we can go ahead and go back to a guide document and see that if we are using firstperson pickup we can attach a Collider so we'll do that in just a sec these two optional steps first off let's just attach the item component so go to add component and then inventory and select items and item and this is the component that sits on all items that's this handle all the most important information back and forward so in the item icon slot the just here select the X icon text texture which is comes with the pack you can get we want that to be equal to true web item type we want this to be a weapon or whatever you've set it to be so if we go under our player and then our inventory we can here see our different armor slot names and you can see here that I have three elements for weapons because I want to be able to carry carry three different weapons which you can then quickly switch between and and therefore I want the item type to match this and it's very important that it's exactly the same or we cannot equip it stackable we're just going to leave that off is equipment we want to check that and we want also to check is also weapon the equip weapon version is what says there is something we're going to fill in in a sec that the other version of the weapon that we will drag in there as a prefab cool so let's continue if we go back to our guide document we can see that we can attach some physics and some colliders so let's do that so hit let's hit add component physics and then a mesh Collider let's do that and this will easily just create a Collider around our mesh you can use any kind of Collider you want but remember that if you want to mesh colliders to collide and not just go through each other you want to check convex so I'm just going to do that for good for God's sake good practice let's set our component again go into physics and this times like rigidbody so once we do this all the settings are just fine and we can collapse both both the mesh Collider and the rigidbody and when we now play we should be able to see the weapon just dropping to the ground and actually if we click it with our mouse now it will pick up so that's something you might want for third person games and then the item is actually already set up so we can see it now in our inventory sorry when we press I but we are in a firstperson game so let's go ahead and add something that will allow us to pick it up by just walking over and pressing e so let's go under let's see where we have it inventory items first person pick up and you can see that we get this yellow arrange once we selected and this is the range you need to be inside in order to pick up the weapon and this might look pretty large but we actually want it to be even larger for this game it's something you're going to have to play around with I'm going to go with something like 2.3 and and the reason why is if we just we don't need to just be incited our center of the player needs to be inside of this so it just measures the distance from the center of our X so the center of our player so it's it's not a Collider per se so let's try to hit play now and we can walk over to our X and you can see that once you get close enough it says press e to pick up X and once we do that we hear a sound the weapon disappears and when we now hit AI we can see it in our inventory and now when we try to equip it to a weapon slot we get an error so let's just close the game here and see what it says it says remember to assign the web equip weapon variable so if we now go ahead and look under our item script we've forgot to make the second version so let's just now duplicate this X hitting ctrl D or command D if you're on a Mac and let's rename this new version 2.x weapon and we could make this X item I'm just going to leave it as X because then when it says press E to pick up X it will not say X item that would be weird so cool so our X weapon let's go ahead and select that and then we can simply just remove the first person pick up the red buddy the mesh Collider and the item scripts so now we are good to go and what we can also do is because the way I've set it up here is I have a weapon script that I attach to all weapons to allow them to do damage and and handle different animations so I'm just going to attach that and again this is part of the survival game series so if you want to learn how to make this or just download it you can always go to Brad keys calm and go into the survival game or you can find the videos on YouTube cool so let's just bump up the damage to something something more like 150 because this is a pretty large and nice axe and the max distance maybe let's do 1.7 maybe even 1.8 and the animator let's just click that and select the only one that does in the scene that's the arms 5 and the damage delay let's just leave that at 0.6 we can test around with that later so now that we have this setup from the survival game series it will also work together with our play it will not just spawn it will also have animations and look really cool awesome so one last thing is just we want to change the layer to draw always again a part of the survival game series which will make sure that this weapon will draw on top of our hands and not behind them cool so now that we have that set up let's go ahead and make this into a new prefab so let's drag the axe weapon down here it to the project pane and we can now just delete it from our scene let's select our axe and then drag in the ex weapon prefab into the equipped weapon version great and now we can drag in our action make that into a prefab as well and and so we can just distribute the x1 around the scene and if we hit play now and we will see our two weapons falling to the ground and if we go try and pick one of them up it will go into our inventory and when we double click this you can see the crypts it in our hand when we then go back to playing we can see that we are constantly hitting things until I press attack and then the computer will think whoops it stopped there for some reason it should just have stopped attacking I don't know why it's glitching out that's weird so let's just give it a sec here and I might need to pause the video quickly I came back there that's weird we have a null reference exception the animator of weapon has not been assigned I'm pretty sure I assign that one this the animator that's it bull didn't I assign that let's just check if all of our references are okay so it's not in here first off in the instruction okay so let's just delete one of these and select the axe here and see what's wrong so the instruction box skin let's actually set that just to other skin remember if you don't know what something what a variable does then you can simply just double click the script and it will open it up and then you can find let's say the variable here and you can just read about it so here it says the skin to use default one is other skin under the resource folder and so you can just go then find it so if you don't know what something is simply just double click it and and we can figure it out cool so it says that under the weapon here that we haven't assigned stuff correctly so let's find out oops try again let's find our axe weapon and let's see yeah the animators not selected so that's annoying that's the thing let's drag it into the scene again and let's just select the animator there and let's hit apply and delete this and now when we go ahead and try and do this we should see working yeah it's working now but it actually it's still not working what is going on the animator so for some reason when we drag it down to be a prefab because it's in the scene the the variable here it loses its connection so what we could do here is we could find it I guess we could maybe drag it in from know we're going to have to retrieve it so let's just make a some kind of function that will allow us to retrieve the animator so I'll just quickly go ahead and pause the camera here and figure out what's going on and I'll be back in a sec okay so I'm back and I found a relatively easy way to just fix this quickly so what is happening is our ex weapon version here needs an animator in order to access the in order to change the animations and we need this to be on the to be the arms 5 animator but because the axe weapon is is not in the scene but it's spawned in we need to find it in our scene once it's spawned so what we can just do is we can open up our weapon script in monodevelop I'll just zoom in here so you can see things a little better and then what we can do is in our function attack damages where we we change the value in here we can simply say that if our animator should be equal to null then we can just find it so if the animator is equal to null then we want to open up some brackets and in here we simply want to say game objects dot find and this is not the best way to do things using game object I find and get component but it will get you there and I mean for 99% of indiegames this should be just fine it's it's okay so game object dot find and then we want to find the arms five object of whatever it's called on your computer and then we want to close this off and we want to do dot get component and then simply open it up and then then it's going to be of type animator so it will find the arms five object and then it will get the component and component animator and we want of course to see say that the animator oops the animator should be equal to game object at fine so just put the animator equals before this now let's see if this will will finally work so let's go in here select our weapon find it in the inventory equip it and now it should be just hitting and when I now press it should stop attacking and and it does so now it has found the animator and to make our weapon nut just hit everything that moves until we have hit a key we can go ahead and find our weapon switch script and then here we can just add a few lines of code so if we scroll all the way down here to find the animator that set bull weapon asan come at true we can simply go down here and we can say the animated set bull and then hit one to false and the same for hit so animator dot set ball hit should also be false and it might just hit a single time but I think that's a bug we can live with because the solution to that is a bit longer and and that's not really the point of this video so now let's go ahead and select the item hit I double click it and it will hit once and it should stop why is it not stopping great so everything is just working today it's great let's see what we can do to change this so we have the animator and we set the bull hit one and hit two to false this should be working again we might need to move this down under the weapon is true statement so let's try this let's try this again we can also just check that our weapon switch script is is correct so find our hold and amelie here and okay so here we have the reason is using a weapon switch not weapon switch to which was the one that I just changed so let's just exit out of that again and I don't know why it's sitting there I don't think we are using it anymore but anyway let's open up the weapon switch this time and now scroll all the way down here find the weapon is on part and in here we want to change stuff so say that the animator that set Bowl hit one should be equal to false and that the animator whoops same mistake again there and that the animator hit two should also be false great let's try this one last time great so we are picking up our weapon finding it in the inventory decrypting it and now it doesn't attack until we tell it to and we can scroll between our weapons the fist and the axe weapon and we can also use our number keys and everything is working just the way we wanted it to that took way too long I'm sorry this tutorial was so clunky but there's a lot of balls in the air whenever you are that you have to keep track of whenever you are making items and inventories because it's so many objects us has to just communicate back and forth so great I hope this wasn't too confusing some of the edits I made here might already be in there when you download the scripts but that's pretty much creating weapons so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
