most of the time when making a game you don't have a huge art team at your disposal that means it's important to think about the ways that you can reduce the amount of time you spend on art and tell based artwork can be a great way of creating simple elements that can be reused over and over again so in this video we'll have a look at creating tile sets in Photoshop also special thanks to Judy Minh bevy oh you Rio Murr hence Huff tune and infinite PP art for their support on patreon and with that let's get painting so before we start creating our own tile set it's probably a good idea that we define what it is because when it comes to tile based graphics there are a lot of terms being thrown around so here are a bunch of examples of Charles a tile is basically just a small image usually rectangular that acts like a puzzle piece of art for building larger images you could imagine how it could combine some of these tiles to create pretty interesting levels a tile set is a collection of tiles that work together so you can see I have four different tasks that I've gone ahead and copied and rotated in various ways and together they make a tile set using this tile set we can paint maps or environments like this one so I quickly put this together using unity spilled in tile map editor and you can see how using only these simple elements we can quickly put together a level you can see a huge number of tile sets made for Mario there's one set for ordinary platforms one force and style platforms one for snowy platforms icy platforms and so on oh well this image is what we call a tile Atlas an Atlas is basically just a collection of all of your tiles packed closely together so this is just one big image containing a bunch of smaller images so now that we have the terminology in place it's time to start creating our own tile set and to make this easier I've gone ahead and created a Photoshop tile set template that you can use I'll of course have a download link for this in the description let's now double click it to open it up in Photoshop and here's what it looks like as you can see we have four different tasks we have the side tile the corner tile the filler and the inner corner by placing and rotating only these four tiles we can create fullon environments I've also included a few examples of how these tiles look when stacked next to each other you can see here that we check how outer rounding looks how in around looks how all of the corner tiles look together and how the sides tile this way you can really ease the check if your pattern is too recognizable and if you have any weird looking seams if you want to go ahead and edit a tile or create one from scratch we simply need to find the corresponding layer down here in the layers panel so I want to start with the side tile and so I'll doubleclick on this side tile layer this is going to open it up in a separate window let's go ahead and zoom in and this tile is made using pixel art if you've never made pix a lot before I have a tutorial for pixel art in Photoshop that you can check out so in here I have a bunch of different layers I have some grass and some dirt let's try and create a new layer let's go to the left here hold down on the brush tool and select pencil tool it's right click and make sure to set the size to 1 and now if we try and paint something onto a texture here save it and go back to the tile set template we can see that all of this side tiles update accordingly and so we can really easily preview your changes of course this doesn't look too good so I'm gonna go ahead and remove it and in fact I want to start from scratch and show you kind of what my process looks like so I'm gonna select our grass and dirt folders and delete them and now we have a blank canvas to paint on I also want to be able to preview my changes without switching back and forth so I'm going to take the breakage tile set template drag it out I'm going to zoom out a bit and make the window fit and now we can duct this in the top right corner of our screen and at this point we're ready to start painting away just to make sure that everything is working I'm going to do a quick smiley face here and when I save this we can see that things are working so the first thing that we want to do is lay out the foundation of our tile and the main thing to think about here is how will it look once our tile repeats in general we want to make sure that what we paint on the left hand side of our image corresponds to what we paint on the right hand side of our image this way we won't get any weird scenes we also want to avoid highlighting a particular part of our tau because in general this will create a very clear pattern and therefore revealed that our tile is repeating so if I go ahead and draw a line that goes like this and say that you can see that this is very clearly repeating the line doesn't add up and that's of course because the left hand side and right hand side of our tile do not match whereas if I were to draw a line like this we can see that when I save we get a uniform line without any breaks so I'm gonna select a basic grass color and I'm gonna lay the foundation for our grass now even though this doesn't look like grass at all yet it's a good idea to try and save your changes and see how it does because we want to make sure that before we start adding detail the overall layout of our tile works and as you can see it actually repeats fairly nicely I do I really think that this pointy bit right here stands out a bit and this is actually where we see our timing let's try and remove that there we go now it's much harder to see where tiles we also notice that if I go ahead and add a very clear piece of detail right here as I said before this will make it very clear that the texture is repeating I think the result speaks for itself here so try and make it as uniform as possible without it getting too boring so now we can add some highlight to our grass this is probably also where I should say that I'm not an artist and so you will have to excuse my artistic skills but hopefully you'll learn something anyways so I'm gonna select a lighter green this time add a new layer and I'll see you in a second so this looks all right and we can go ahead and add another layer of highlighter so I think that's actually fine for our grass now it's time to add some dirt for this I'm gonna select a light brown color I'm gonna go to the left here and hold down on our shape tool to select the rectangle tool and then gonna click and drag to fill out the entire bottom part of our image and it's also drag the layer to the bottom if we now save this we can see that it starts to look like a tile but everything currently looks very flat that's because we need to add some shadow to our grass I'm also going to rename some of these layers to stay organized so right above our dirt base let's add another layer and for the shadow of our grass I want to select a darker green but I also want to make it more blue let's figure shadows in general or tinted a bit blue let's go to the top here and select our color and I'm gonna paint in some shadows I'm gonna call it grass shadow and I'm actually also going to add a layer to the top which I'm also going to call grass shadow and that's just because I want to define it a bit more towards the top of our image here I'm also making the shadows spill in a bit towards the center this makes it feel less like a block of grass and more organic let's save this you can see that definitely help things along but our image still looks very 2dimensional that's because we've only added shadow to our actual grass we also want a bunch of shadows bleeding onto the dirt and maybe even some detail in the dirt itself let's go ahead and add another layer let's call it dirt shadow light let's choose a darker brown as you can see this definitely helps pop we need a darker color still that's great another layer on top of that let's call it dirt shadow dark and I'm gonna select an even darker Brown I'm finally once you're satisfied we can add a tiny bit of detail to our third base of course we could go in and paint this manually but I found a very easy way to do this is by using noise if we duplicate our do it base by hitting ctrl J or command J if you're on the Mac we can go to the top here under filter we can then go under noise and hit add noise then it's going to ask you if you want to convert it to a smart object or raster rights the image we can just rasterize it and now we can add noise to our image I'm gonna select uniform make sure it's just like monochromatic if you only want your noise to be black and white we and then choose an amount I think this is fine around three percent and hit OK now this definitely already makes the dirt look more interesting but I think it looks way too much like noise however if you hit control T we can scale it up a bit and this makes it seem less like noise and more like a pattern so if we're now safe we can see it has a nice bit of grain to our texture we can right click and delete the vector mask here and instead we can go in and remove the dirt at the top here and it can also be a good idea to remove a bit of the noise along the sides here just to make it tile more evenly there we go there are plenty of stuff that you could still do to this but if we try and fullscreen our tile set template we've actually created a side tile and the exact same techniques applied to all of the oddly tiles for the corner tile here what I recommend doing is actually using your side tile as a base if we go ahead and disable all the layers that are already there we can go into our side tile we can select all the layers in here right click go to placate layers paste them into our corner tile we then switch over to our corner tile what are them recommend doing is grouping these so we'll hit the folder icon or press ctrlg we can then duplicate this entire group by hitting ctrl J will then use ctrl T and rotate it by 90 degrees so I'm holding down shift to rotate in increments then we can go under the group on top here and remove our two dirt based layers you can see it already kind of starts to look like a corner we then go to the bottom here and make sure our third base here only goes in the actual corner and remove anything from the third base noise layer here I bump up the size on this so we can get rid of all of it so all this around here and then it's just about removing parts of the image so we'll go to the group on top here we'll take all of our dirt shadow dark here and remove it for this part do the same thing with the dirt shadow light and the same thing with the grass shadow and you can see it starts to blend together like a corner of course you'll probably want to add a bit of detail to round things out and maybe also remove some of the base in the actual corner itself here but if we were to preview it it's actually not too bad of course definitely clean it up add more detail and overall just have fun with it but that is the basics of creating tile sets in Photoshop so that's pretty much it for this video if you want to see more videos on Photoshop definitely let me know in the comments also having covered the unity tom map system in a video yet so if that's something you're interested in definitely let me know about that as well on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in December and a
