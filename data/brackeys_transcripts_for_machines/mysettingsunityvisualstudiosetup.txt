hello on the reason I did a top 10 unity tricks video which you can check out here a lot of you guys asked which settings I use for unity and Visual Studio I like to configure my workspace to get the most out of it and I hope you will find these features as useful as I do keep in mind only use some of these settings on tutorials because I want people to be able to follow along so here are my settings 2017 let's begin with the unity UI here's what it looks like by default first off I like to take my project panel and switch to a one column layout I don't like to drag it over here by the hierarchy and also drag the console so that it aligns with the scene you like to make this pretty small and most of the time I'll take my game view and dock it side by side with the scene view so I can see both at the same time also like to make my inspector fairly big and always remove the asset store I think it's much easier to use in the web browser then I normally go window and find the animator I like to either have this on my secondary monitor or if that's not available to me I'll just target by the game view and the animation window I'll have sit down here by the console so pretty simple not much to it but I really like it this way I will also always go to edit project settings and then quality and make sure these settings are set pretty high this just allows you to view your game at maximum quality instead of having unity do texture compression or turn off certain lights let's just go in here and change the pixel light count to 20 keep the texture settings and then pop up empty aliasing to at least 4 sometimes I'll even go to the shadow resolution and set that to very high of course you should always go back and configure the different levels to suit your game but when viewing it in the editor it's a good idea to have maximum quality then always go to edit preferences if there's a particular project that I'm often working on I'm just going to check off the load previous project on startup but of course I've been doing a lot of tutorials and so I'm not going to click that one under external tools I'll always select visual studio 2015 over in monodevelop I just really prefer that I also like to go to colors and just give it a bit of play mode tint so then I'm always notified when I'm in play mode in the editor finally I go to edit project settings and then choose editor and in here always make sure my version control is set to visible metafiles that's because I normally use github as source control and having visible metafiles makes it a lot easier to see what's going on I would also set the acid civilization to force text by default it's going to be on make but first Texas just so much nicer when using github so if we now go and create a new script I just call this one test script you can see that it generates this default template I don't like this default template thankfully unity action that has a way to customize this all I need to do is go to the path on the screen now it's going to depend on your operating system so once you get to that path it's going to look something like this if you're using csharp the file you want to edit is the csharp script new behavior script C is text so double click on that and you can simply change this to whatever you want I like to delete the two using tags except for the using unity engine also like to remove the comments put the curly brackets here on new lines and I'll often add a comment up here saying something like this and if you want this to be really neat you can even add some regions that allows you to easily collapse different parts of your codes inside of Visual Studio we could for example say region and then something like variables or public fields and then end region and do one here for unity callbacks as well so we can do region unity methods and down here we'll say in region so if we now save this and head back into unity we can create a new test script so let's go here csharp script new test scripts so if we now double click this to open it in Visual Studio we can see our new template you can see how you can collapse these regions really easily and of course if you want to create a variable now you would add it in here and we can collapse that a lot so of course configured my visual studio a bit as well mainly I've changed some of the college team I'm using is called mono Kai I've also switched to the default of having curly brackets on a new line and all the small formatting stuff and of course my window layout itself instead of going through and showing you how to add all that stuff I've exported my visual studio settings and I'll have a download link for that in the description so it should look something like this by default after downloading my settings file simply go to tools import and export settings choose import selected environment settings hit next you can choose to save your current settings I'm just going to hit no and the next I'm going to hit browse find the file on the system in my case it's going to be brekkie settings it's a good idea to store this it open hit next and you can choose what parts you want to import I'm just going to import all of them and then hit finish which is Cydia might complain a little bit but it shouldn't really matter you can see everything looks just the way we want it to also if you're using Mac unity won't let you download vish studio that's because the traditional version of Visual Studio only runs on Windows sidious after all created by Microsoft however recently Microsoft started a new project called Visual Studio code it has the same feel and vibe as the oldschool Visual Studio but it's a lot lighter and it runs on Mac if you want to use that with unity you can again click in the description and download it you should also go to the asset store and download this free extension because vs code and it will help integrate Visual Studio code with unity this will give you features like intellisense and ec debugging there's a guide here on how to set it up if you've ever used Visual Studio with unity or version control software you know that it can sometimes mess up your line endings and that might cause unity to complain your version control software to complain or Visual Studio to complain to make sure that I always have consistent line endings I use a plugin called stripping I can access it by going to tools strip them choose my line ending type it ok and now every time I save a file it's going to save with that convention to download ribbon simply close down visual studio click the link in the description hit download choose adding only 4 vs 2015 click the file and for me it's going to say that it's already installed or it should just run through the installation process for you now when you open up visual studio again you should see the addon here so that was my settings I hope you enjoyed them if you have any great
