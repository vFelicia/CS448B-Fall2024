hello everyone and welcome to this behindthescenes video showing the creation of my entry into the Ludum dare 36 combo I'm actually really happy with how the game turned out so those of you who don't know Lewton dairy is the biggest game development competition in the world the rules are simple you have 48 hours to create a game using only selfmade assets that's also jam for those who want to work together with the team in which you have an extra 24 hours however I worked on this game alone so I submitted it to the combo the theme was announced three hours after midnight it was ancient technology I decided to sleep through the night and began working when I woke up I started by taking an hour off to brainstorm different ideas I considered making an endless runner through the streets of ancient Egypt where the game was centered around avoiding different ingenious traps upon exploring the idea I found that the game would quickly become very hard heavy and that it was too alike other projects I've done in the past I really wanted to do something different so scrapped that idea but decided to stick with the Egyptian theme my new idea making a spinoff to the old skool gold miner game when instead of taking from the surface you would be able to move underground using your grappling hook the miner where I decided to call mr. Dickens then stumbles upon what looks like modern technology proving that the Egyptians were way ahead of the time at this point I was ready to jump into unity I got the grappling mechanic done pretty quickly once the hook fired properly and I was able to keep track of what objects it hid I made the player move to the location of the hidden object the real challenge here was making the movement feel smooth and responsive I found that the best way of doing this was using a chain of kuroh teams that were each responsible for shooting the grappling hook returning it or pulling in the player I also decided to stay completely away from the Unity physics components only using colliders for hit detection this gave me complete control over speed and smoothing of the movement next up was collecting items I gave each item a rarity and await the width of the item was then calculated based on those factors I finally got a bit tired looking at those temporary sprites so I hopped into Photoshop and of course forgot to hit record anyway here's the result by the way when you aren't allowed to find textures on Google you'll find yourself using a lot of fractal noises staying on the subject of graphics I created some particle effects for the items I made a little explosion we're collecting them I also added some image effects especially in the motion blur made moving around the scene feel a lot more exciting a couple that with letting the camera move together with the grappling hook I quickly realized that the levels would have to be fairly large in order for that to be enough content to explore so I decided to generate the level procedurally by semi randomly placing items of varying rarity and size around the scene because the rarity and amount of items increases linearly with depth the player is incentivized to dig deeper I needed some UI to display the amount of money earned along with the countdown timer that ends the game after 2 minutes the user is then met with an end screen that displays the score I later added a locally stored high score as well I then added a main menu and a pause menu at this point the core game felt almost complete however I didn't have a way to communicate story to the user or display jokes for this I made a simple Pokemon inspired dialogue system that other systems could easily block into using events I also felt the need to do a bit of optimization especially because I wanted to make the levels even bigger so upon generating the map I created a huge list and populated it with all the items and their respective positions of scale and then loaded these in when the player got near destroyed them again when out of range this greatly reduced the number of objects in the scene at any given time after having played the game all the way through a couple of times I discovered that the time limit felt more like a constraint than a challenge to fix this I added bonus time to the items so the player could extend the play time by improving at the game time for music for this I used a great and simple program used by a lot of jammers called bus Casio busca Carl busca SOI anyway the main theme sounds like this and then created an audio manager that could easily play sounds with varying volume and pitch I used Adobe Audition to record a bunch of sounds I pretty much searched my entire apartment looking for objects to smash together at this point the game was pretty much ready to be packaged up and submitted so I quickly threw together an icon for the executable and began exporting to all of the different platforms the game was submitted just before the deadline which means very late at night for me this is how I looked at the end tired and happy that was pretty much my experience developing ticking I hope you will enjoy playing it there's a link in the description I would love to livestream the next Ludum dare II let me know if that is something you want to see in the comments other than that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to all the awesome patreon supporters who donated in July and a special thanks to VC NP and you okay and Locke's game TV
