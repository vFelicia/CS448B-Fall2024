hello everyone and Welcome to our ninth video in our survival gam series done by brais I am the CEO of brais and today we are going to take a quick look at creating um materials and textures to and applying them to objects and uh also creating um some cool lighting some uh some point lights and some glowing effects and uh stuff like this um so first of all go ahead and over up Unity it looks exactly like it did before and uh I'm going to go ahead and rename this terrain to um grassy terrain if we're going to have multiple levels or it's going to persist of different kind of terrains and first of all something that annoyed me is just how much green uh this terrain has um so let's uh go ahead and create a road that leads up to our house so um we can uh go ahead and select the brushes and then open up our browser uh and look for a texture Road texture um and I'm sure that if you search for Rog texture it could be hard to find something we could try it out um yes it's it's going to look something like this and we could make it out of concrete um but I won't something more like gravel gravel texture seamless um yeah I think this actually is pretty good um could try that out uh this one is not bad either um actually let's uh get this a try so um save it up and uh drag it into unity and once again rename it we going to rename this to gravel texture 01 and uh we're going to uh simply select our terrain also one thing I forgot in our project pane go down and rename the terrain that lies here so this is basically the backup data for the terrain that is in our scene and let's uh name this exactly the same so grassy terrain now select our Terrain in the scene go to edit t textures add texture and then just drag in our gravel and uh the size is going to be let's start out by 10 by 10 and add select it and we can then go ahead and just simply paint it out so um I'll select a brush that is a little more rough in it its edges maybe that one and and uh bring the brush size down something like this and then simply uh start painting so it'll just go around like this and where ends up with the mountain might not look that good uh might not look that good either here but this is basically where I want a small City or Village to be so I'll just make something like this for now very classic RPG type game um looking something like this let's go ahead and preview this in game um so I think that the texture is too big uh generally the the textures are too big so um I guess we'll just leave that and adjust those later um not the best textures that I've chosen um but um this just applies some detail it's nice all right so um you can go ahead and save this um and let's now look at uh creating some textures for the walls so let's just choose some kind of wooden walls um if we are uh using maces and swords you might not have made the those out of bricks so let's type plank texture seamless see see if anything comes up yes this one is not bad looks like something that could have stood outside so save this and drag it into unity and you probably know the procedure so far so um planks texture 01 also you don't have to put texture um on in every every name just use your own system right so um the input settings looks fine uh now let's go ahead and create a new material so um the terrain basically doesn't need it material it handles sort of this lighting properties and that itself so uh but a object does so let's hit the um let's right right click in our assets hit create material and then uh call this planks and drag in our texture the main color still needs to be white um it's going to be a diffuse texture and then we can just go ahead and drag it on to our different walls and uh something that has been annoying me a bit is the fact that these um are not actually on the wooden plate so um let's just go ahead and adjust the transform to make them a little more precise no need to be perfect um again this should be done in other applications I'm just showing you how to do this especially the modeling part the texturing can be done in unity just using seamless but um come on guys I'm sure you can figure something out all right so um this looks better if we go ahead and preview it in game I can see that we might want to uh tile these one more time so this is done by selecting the material and go on tiling and then hitting 2 two let's try that yeah this looks better actually maybe two or uh 3 two so it tiles one extra down the middle I think this uh this looks good kind of a highr texture so um one thing uh I I want to change now is that this is just a diffuse Shader I want to apply some more lighting detail um there no needs for you to do this but um at some point I think we should go into normal mapping and uh bump mapping and all these different kind of kinds of techniques so um if if you are way ahead you can go ahead and download Crazy bump and uh see if you can figure it out yourself but for now uh let's create a model that can act as our lights so uh or lamp so let's go ahead and go under game object create other and then hitting this feere and 0 z0 bringing it up a bit hitting F to zoom in game object create other and then cylinder scaling it down this is a mount on the wall uh so this will act as a mount and scale it down create yet another game object this is going to be a cube track it down scale it down make it longer this is actually the part that is going to be mounted on the wall and bigger on some axis scale it down to look like a plank there you go this is pretty decent not amazing but it'll do for now now so this is our lamp that we can mount on our wall so we can go ahead and rename the sphere to lamp and we can go ahead and make this our Mount you know what lamp Mount drag that under lamp and we can select our cylinder and do lamp mount mount do uh lamp cylinder this is fine and just drag it on the lamp also so um now we can go ahead and um position it on the wall there and I want to bring it up might be uh too big in general so just scale it down not in general over all and um so that's that is on the wall and you can adjust all all you want um I'm going to leave it at this and uh so I'm going to select different parts and give them different kinds of materials and textures so the light itself the bulb itself which is pretty uh huge here um is going to have a glowing material the lamp cylinder is going to have yet another material and the lamp Mount is going to have a third material so uh I think that the lamp Mount we could probably just apply planks to that one and it will look all right remember the tiling is different so if I apply this and go ahead and change the tiling um it will affect both of them so just keep that in mind that you have to create multiple materials if you want different uh tiling properties so uh let's go ahead and right click can create yet another material and this one is going to be called just uh gray no uh dark gray or gray dark if you want to do it that way and just the main color just drag this down to a almost black and there you go so that's it for the mount what I'm going to scale this Mount down the cylinder there this is better um so that looks better um and now let's go ahead and create the uh the glowing so right click new material call this glow and um there are not really any wonderful ways to make an object glow in unity without spending some money on a plugin so I'm just going to to show you one of the ones that I use uh it could be selfilluminated or unlet whatever you think uh I like the unlit transparent so drag that on uh on there and you can have a texture over it um maybe the selfilluminated diffuse so you can go in and you can uh you can change the color of the light and uh make some illuminated and even make the light mapper itself emit but uh play around with these um again that's not really an awesome way to do it um maybe the self Illuminator um I'm I'm pretty sure that one of these actually have a transparent mode uh you could do the reflective to make it reflect the uh whole environment um so so just play with it you might find something you like at the end um you could also do stuff like uh on the particles you can do additive um Tex uh materials this will only work though if you also apply a texture of course it shouldn't be this texture but something in that order um but okay for now I'll just go ahead and change this to selfilluminated theuse and make the color a orange white is so that looks all right uh I'll go ahead and drag out these two objects so I can scale it down a bit it might be too huge anyway um and then just drag them back in so yeah this is better um now let's go ahead and actually create what will emit the light so go to game object and create other and then choose the point light and um you can see that it already looks much better um this will just be centered in the middle of our sphere and we can go ahead and adjust some of the settings maybe um if we select it uh the the light it's that one and drag it under our lamp we can call this lamp light and um we can go ahead and play around with some of the settings so make it more orange uh bump up the range to maybe 30 20 30 we do 30 and then down the intensity of the light something you like you know what I'll I'll keep this is at 0.5 so um this already looks uh pretty good um if you want it to look like it's glowing a little bit more you can do something that is called haloing so um we could go ahead and hit the component and then go to rendering and hit the where is it the skyx flare cusion uh maybe miscellaneous wow I'm not sure now um oh so it's under effect and then Halo and if we go ahead and adjust it so um I put it this on the lamb itself so if we go ahead and change the size of it you can see what it's actually about so it creates this spher soft object around the object itself so if you just make this a tiny bit bigger than the glowing sphere itself so something like 0.5 and then change the color to maybe something brighter I don't know um for sure make it more orange though then we can actually make something that looks like it grow it glows a bit it's not perfect but it uh it will do the job so there you have it and this light is dyamic dynamic so should you choose to make it rigid body and fall around the scene or animated um everything will animate with it will not do light mapping just yet that's how you create uh some textures um apply them to objects um materials and uh glowing effects I hope you enjoy this tutorial and go ahead and visit our website uh you can play some of our games and soon you can download the uh scripts that I type in the videos and some of the assets that I create so you don't have to create everything yourself if you don't want to or you can just generally buy me a cup of coffee um for now the models and scripts are free you can donate if you want to all the money goes to something like this it goes to new sound gear uh more more plugins maybe I could do some tutorials on Unity Pro once I get the money um so um but you don't have to you can just keep on watching for free I enjoy making these and uh it makes me happy if if you can learn something from it so um thank you for watching
