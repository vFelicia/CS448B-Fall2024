so do you need unity Pro nope thanks of the awesome patron alright maybe the answer is a bit more complicated than that let's try and break it down also thanks to hands off tuned for his support on patron now let's get into the free version of unity unity personal includes all engine features this means that you have access to all functionality within the editor in previous versions of unity a lot of features like realtime shadows render textures and the profiler were not part of the free version in fact you have to purchase separate licenses in order to publish for mobile but as of mid 2016 all engine features and platforms are freely available so why would you need to pay for a subscription well unity now offers to paid price tiers plus and pro unity plus gives you the ability to customize the splash screen this means that you can put your own logo instead of the unity logo at the start of your game you also get access to performance reporting which automatically collects errors across all platforms and devices which means that you can quickly find an address issues this is cool because it can be used to solve bugs after release and then of course there's unity teens unity teams is a set of features that makes it easier for multiple people to work together on a project both collaborate and cloud build are part of unity teams that means that you sync your project to the cloud and other team members can make changes and publish them from within the editor when a change is made unity will then automatically create builds for the desired platforms and send them to all team members this can be a huge time saver because you no longer have to worry about version control and it pretty much eliminates time spent waiting on builds as of making this video unity teams is free for everyone but that unfortunately ends this October from there on out unity teams can be bought as part of unity plus or as a separate subscription but splash screens and collaboration aside we all know the real reason for buying unity the dark editor skin no and when it comes to unity Pro you get all the same features as with plus but with some added extras most of it however is fairly minor to regular indie developers if you're making a multiplayer game unity Pro will allow you to have more concurrent users but really the main reason for picking up unity Pro is that it has no limit on annual revenue remember that unity personal is only available to studios who generate less than $100,000 a year and during the plus 4 studios that generate less than 200,000 again this mostly applies to wellestablished studios but it's definitely good to keep in mind so now that we know the difference between the different versions which one should you pick well that totally depends in my opinion if you're a new developer working on your own there's no problem in using the free version it has all the core engine features and some of the cloud stuff to make your life a little bit easier so you can definitely make and publish some great games using unity personal of course you will have to live with the light editor skin when it comes to your new Pro I think it's way overkill for small indie Studios especially one that's just starting out however if you're serious about making games for living especially if you're working with multiple people picking up unity plus can speed up development quite a bit oh and I almost forgot if you subscribe to unity plus or pro you'll now get a free essentials pack this is actually a really nice selling point because some of the tools like the uber standard shader and final ik' are really nice tools in their own right so whether you want to get Unity personal plus or pro you can click the link in the description to be taken to the website in the end the choice is totally up to you and feel free to join the conversation in the comments keep in mind that this video is solely based on my own personal experiences and I would love to hear what you guys have to say on the subject on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in Arcis and especially thanks to hansip tune Derek him skirt face on Murphy yes per magazine James P psychic mommy Jason Lotito Erin Robert bond who some Kazaa and Judah Minh if you want to become a patron yourself you can do so at patreon.com slash brackets thanks a lot guys
