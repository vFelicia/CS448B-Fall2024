thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and welcome to video number 16 in the how to make a 2d platformer course in today's video we're going to take a small break from all of the coding and upgrade our project to the allnew unity 5 so if you are fully confident in your ability to do this on your own and fix any errors if there are some please just skip this video I just wanted to really show you how to do this because some might find it a bit scary to do themselves so that's what we're going to be doing today I'm also going to talk a bit about what the new features are and how we might want to use them in our project and we're also going to update the astar pathfinding project folder because that's a bit outdated so that's what we're going to do today and again if this is not interesting to you to skip ahead on to the next video where I'm sure we're going to be doing more enemy stuff cool so as always if you have any questions throughout this video go over to firmed up practice to come to get your questions answered so unity just released unity 5 they've been hinting at it a lot and there's already a lot of content on it out there but of course we're going to be using it in this tutorial series and I might also do a new series specifically covering things in unity 5 if that's something you want to see leave a comment in down below because I really want to know if that's something you're really interested in or if I should put my focus elsewhere but without further ado let's first off open up our browser head over to unity 3d comm you can see that right now they are showing off unity here so we can simply hit the get unity 5 button or he'd get unity up here and the unity is now split up into well two additions for normal indecent studios then you also have for Enterprise Education and all that but for most people it can be split up into two additions the personal edition and the professional edition and the big change here is that the personal edition will now feed now has all engine features so stuff that wasn't usable before such as soft shadows different rendering techniques image effects writing textures there what else was there that's a lot of stuff streaming asset asset bundles all the kinds of stuff that was before a pro feature is now included in the personal Edition so all that the unity that that really changes about the unity engine from the personal and the professional Edition is stuff like analytics and that kind of external supports on some cloud building the team license of course then you have the theme and then the customizable splash screen so but for most most people personal addition is going to be just fine so let's hit free download there and you can download the Installer here I've already done that and I've already installed unity so once you have done that click double click unity 5 and it will prompt you with the new opening screen here where you can either create a new project or open another one and what I want you to do now is just go ahead and make a backup of your project as is so head over to Dropbox or wherever you have it stored find the project I have it here simply control C or and then paste it elsewhere or if you're using some kind of version control system such as kid I suggest you go ahead and make a commit now so once you've done that simply hit open other then navigate to your folder find it here select folder hit upgrade and it's gonna do some calculations now I'm just gonna make sure that my Dropbox syncing is past and just tell it that you've made a backup so just go ahead and update the API because inside of unity itself some API things have changed so that means that some of the ways that we write code has changed in unity and this is mostly to do with the gate component stuff now you don't have these easy accessors such as transform or such as a rigidbody with a small R instead you have to do get component rigidbody just to make things more clear but it's going to go ahead and update that for you and in a sec it's gonna open up our project here so this is what it looks like unity 5 if you have some text rendering issues with that which I had when I tried this out before simply can restart unity and it it should work but let's just dig right into it let's try and hit play just maximize some play for now and see if this works and indeed it does we actually have no compiler errors which is really awesome that means that we can focus on some of the cool stuff that and that has come with unity 5 one thing I want to go ahead and do though is just update ad a star path finding project it might prompt you to do this when you open it up it might have a big green Update button if it doesn't which it did not in my case sometimes that for some reason doesn't really happen all you need to do is delete the folder we should see an arrow here yeah saying that it cannot find the name space because we've just deleted it then go on to the internet and search search for a star path finding and whoops not very peachy here we're gonna go to the official website which is this one and we're gonna go and download it and we're gonna download version 3.6 it's going to download here open it up in this sit file navigate through the folder and just publicly the unity package and it's gonna import it inside of unity simply hit import and it's gonna do all of the hard stuff so let's just wait for this to correctly import and it's gonna be ready about now cold and again here an API update is required so simply say that you made a backup and just go ahead and update it and it's gonna do that and in just a sec it's gonna be done there we have it it removes the errors and there we go so now the project here is fully updated and are ready to use and if you don't believe me you can of course hit play and see that this is indeed working so that was pretty much everything that we need to do in this video what I want you to just take a moment to show you now is what this has actually changed about our project first off its done some up quite a few actually optimizations behind the scene stuff like instantiating prefabs is much easier on the computer now so you can be a lot more free about when you instantiate things also it made some a few changes to the API as I told you which we are probably gonna run into at some point and a really cool thing it did this was before a pro feature but of course this is now in the personal edition is that when we had play right now what it actually does behind the scene is it takes all of the different sprites here all of the different sprites that we have in our scene and it combines them into one latch texture which is called the sprite atlas as we talked about and what this does it's it is it basically saves us a whole bunch of draw calls you can see our calls and they are much much fewer than the word before actually I ran ran a test and right before upgrading I had a draw call count of about 34 and now it's it's actually under 10 and draw calls optimizing draw calls will reel save out on a computer rendering time especially on mobile devices so that's a really awesome thing to have free now another cool thing that I want to show you and I'm really going into the 2d stuff here because the 3d stuff such as global illumination and the whole new lighting system physically based rendering and all that there's been plenty of courage on that so I just wanted to keep it really specific for this tutorial another thing that is cool that we can now have our image effects so if we head over to our camera we can actually add some image effects on to this so let's rightclick our project hit import package and go into effects and it's just gonna start importing here so we'll wait for that that's quite a lot of importing and and processing going on in this video that's okay and it's gonna import all of the different image effects and that's created by unity but really you can use any thirdparty effects now you can find some on the internet and just drag them in this was of course before a pro feature and now we can select our camera hit add component go into image effects and you can see we have all kinds of cool stuff here first off you'll notice that if we go under camera and he hit vignette and chromatic aberration this is an effect I really like on 2d games we can do a cool camera Vic Ned and of course you can bump this to whatever you want I want something like 0.6 maybe just to give it that cool falloff around the edges I think that looks pretty good we have some falloff already in our background but it's nice to have it on the other elements as well and what you can also do if you want to is you can blur out the corners you can see if I really exaggerate the effect what it does and I just want to do this a tiny bit we also have the blur distance and I'm we are not gonna miss too much with that I think 0.75 is actually quite fine but the amount is gonna be bumped down quite a bit here so let's see what looks nice I will try I think even one is too much less let's try a 0.3 yeah that just gives it a very subtle cool smoothing effect make it makes it look kind of futuristic which is of course what we are going for or at least what I am going for and yeah you can play around with the rest of the image effects we are definitely going to be using some at least I hope for example if our we are going to implement some shooting some cool they're shooting effects like if we're gonna have to need so something then the bloom effect would be really awesome and this is in general a really cool effect that you should have a look at I mean you can just adjust the threshold here and then make some cool flashing so that's a really awesome one another really cool looking one is the grayscale effect so if we're gonna color adjustments select grayscale you can just create out the image it's it's that symbol and one and that you're probably going to be using a lot is under color adjustments and then color correction curves and you can see right now it looks really bad but if we go in here and change all these to the linear prefab or it preset it's gonna look just as it did before that's gonna be no change and then you can change the saturation manually you can change the red tones and how they fall off so create some interesting effects here you can of course edit this just the way you wanted to just wanted to show you what this looks like so really have a lot of fun with this it's it's super awesome but for now I'll just leave the vignette on there of course if you are rendering actually I want to bump down the blurring to something like 0.2 if you are publishing planning to publish to a mobile device and would come leave effects out of the picture yeah or at least not overdo it cool so that was another cool feature another thing I just quickly want to mention is that we now have an audio mixer but you see here and we can go ahead and create a mixer here later and where you can mix all of the different audio channels and that's gonna be really handle and handy once we start making music for our game and really mixing all of the different sounds together I'm just gonna close down this tab here and delete it delete this folder here that was something I was messing around with earlier it's an the UPA toolkit the pixel art toolkit that I've made I've just tried to implement it here I think we're gonna be using it in a later video and then at last we have the profiler and this is actually really really cool because what the profiler does is it allows us to have a look at what basically a breakdown of our application what takes time on the CPU the GPU what stores what uses a lot of storage in memory is the physics system doing too much it really breaks down our application and allows us to find just the places in in our game that needs our attention when it comes to performance so if we click here to open up the profiler and just dock it here what we're gonna do is we're going to make sure that it's set to record then we're just gonna play through a tiny bit of our game and maybe just jump around do some shooting and then fall down wait to respawn and now let's stop this we can go through the profiler and you can see that it made this timeline and this is actually functioning in real time but I just wanted to play through and then show you this but you can of course dark it down here and then what just watch it go as you play through you can see that it makes this timeline where you can see all of the different that make up your game and the spikes in when they are using a lot of resources and for each frame if we focus on that say this frame you can see what took a lot of time and what required a lot of computer attention so to say so what we can do here is we can turn off vsync here that's the yellow part that's not really important for us we can turn off others we can even turn off rendering physics and all of that to only focus on the scripts and this really allows us to see exactly where when and how it spends a lot of time executing the script that we have created so let's see we have a spike here and that's in the behavior update you can see that a star is here spending quite a bit of time it's actually 12 milliseconds on updating the route that we are that the enemy is taking and then we are pretty flatlined and soon until we hit another spike here where I can see a star spending a lot of time so it's it's very clear to us here that the thing that is really spending and the computer resources a script wise is da star path finding algorithm and that's of course shouldn't come as a shock doing these calculations path calculations is pretty taxing but once you start expanding on your game it's really easy to narrow down what exactly is slowing your came down using this profiler so that's something you should really get used to using so I'm just gonna turn back on all of this and we can see here I'm just gonna close down the profiler and that was basically it for this video all I wanted to talk about was just how to setup unity how to update it and or set up unity 5 how to update to unity 5 and kind of what it allows us to do so in the next video we are definitely going to be scripting some more we're gonna get back into it but this was just in case and you guys hadn't heard about all of this new interesting stuff that is now available to us so thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed it and let's and I'll see you in the next video thanks
