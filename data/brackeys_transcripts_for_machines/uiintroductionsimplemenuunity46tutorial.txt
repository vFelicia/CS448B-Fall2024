thanks for tuning in at brakus hello everyone and welcome to this introduction video to the all new unity GUI system so it's finally out unity four point six has been released as a public beta and is now available for download it's it's pretty amazing these tools have been expected for so so long it's basically become the developers equivalent to halflife 3 at this point so that's super house awesome that we can finally get to play around with these tools so to download this please go to unity 3d comm slash unity slash beta slash 4.6 and you can download it here please remember that this is a beta and there might be some bugs here and there cool I've also gone ahead and went over to the break ease forum and created a GUI system section under the answers section where you can post questions about the unity GUI and there's plenty of people here ready to help you should you get stuck so go to forums our break is to come and visit the GUI section you can also highlight your stuff if you make something cool or just generally discuss the new GUI system so today we're going to be creating a very simple menu like the one you see here you can see that I have some buttons set up they don't do anything when you press them I just want to give you an idea of how you work with the GUI in unity and how some of the different elements can be put together so we have a toggle and a slider three buttons and a input field where you can type stuff cool so let's go ahead and dig right into today's subject and start creating the GUI of today so let's delete the canvas and the event system here which I've just graded and let's start from fresh so you can see that I have a basic scene setup here just a main camera with a skybox a Sun with a particle system and that's basically it so that's not much to it so we can just go ahead and start building the UI now so in the hierarchy rightclick your mouse cursor and go on the UI and select button and you can see that it automatically creates three things actually four it creates a canvas which is basically the screen it emulates the screen on our screen size so it's basically just the restrictions of our GUI everything in our GUI needs to be inside of the canvas here then it creates a button which also has a child which is the text of the button and it also creates an event system that you should just leave as soon as it's pretty important that you leave it here so if we go ahead and double click on the canvas we will send assume in on it and then over here in the right hand corner we can go ahead and select to view it from the front here so just make sure that you view it directly from the front or you could quickly get annoyed you could go into 2d mode to make things even easier I'm going to do that because then we also have the grid cool so what we're going to do is we're going to select the button and make sure that we have the new 2d control selected in the left hand corner it's going to be really annoying rotating and scaling this then we can just go ahead and maybe size this up just drag the righthand corner hold down alt to scale on both axes and then shift to scale about preserving the aspect ratio just to make this a bit better a bit bigger then select the text here and we're going to maybe say play game we're going to bump up the font size a bit and yeah I think that's pretty much all we need to do with the text then we can go back and select the button and we can maybe color this so let's make it a reddish color groups like this maybe bump up the alphabet that doesn't look too bad I just wanted to look kind of action like if this was like a space shooter or something and also for the text let's go ahead and make this white and now we can just position this a bit to the right here go into the game view and see how it actually looks that wasn't too bad you can always adjust the position X&Y from the game view here to really adjust it the way you want it to something like there it looks pretty great and what you might notice is that the play game and the GUI element here looks just the tiniest bit blurred and the reason why is we need to go into the canvas here and select what is called pixel perfect and this will move the elements just a bit to make them are actually well pixel perfect it will make them look a bit crisper and a bit sharper so now it looks better and we can go ahead and create some sub buttons here so let's just call this one D play button let's select it and press control D let's then move this down and then scale it a bit to the left now we can duplicate this again and move it to the right so now we have two of these sub buttons here these smaller buttons the first one we're going to rename to load button and then we're going to do a Save button also here and let's dig into these and change the text so this is going to be load I'm going to do capital letters and then this Save button here's of course going to say save then we can go ahead and select both of them and change the color to something a bit more neutral like the great here so that looks pretty decent now we can go ahead and actually let's just bring down the L found these just a bit to make them less puppy cool and then we can go ahead and create another UI element so rightclick on the canvas go under UI and select the let's do the toggle here so now we can move this over and position it so that the toggle itself here the marker is just aligned with the buttons I notice that unity now has some very fine snapping tools with the GUI which are very nice so let's rename this to music toggle let's drop down this menu drop down the background and select the label here let's call this music and let's go ahead and make this white and let's also select the whole music toggle here and just scale it a bit to the left because we are now going to add one more element which is the slider and we can just drag this over and just align it completely with the toggle drag this over to scale it to line up with the buttons here and yeah I think that's pretty good we can go ahead and see how that looks in game that looks pretty nice you can also scale this up should you want it to be little wider that might be good maybe bit less wide something like there it's pretty good and now we basically have a three buttons a music toggle and a volume slider and that was just in a couple of minutes so you can see just how effective it is to set up basic you eyes using this system now let's rename the slider to volume slider and let's also make a fine the element which is going to be under UI and it's the input field so let's just drag this oops drag this over Center it on our UI that's centered and then hold down shift or only move it on one axis and we can go ahead and change the background because I don't really like this one too just the ordinary background then we can maybe change the color to match the color up here and while we do that I just want to show you something cool with colors if you go under the color on the play game button you can see that we can add a preset so just click here to add a new preset and now it's saved there so when we hit under the input field and select the color here you'll simply click then it will now have the exact same color and alpha settings as the play game button now we can head under this and select the text let's make this white you will notice that the active text color here is also white so you will have to change them both this is the default one and this is the one whenever we are actually typing something then the selection color that's going to make that white also because the blue one doesn't really fit with our color scheme now when we go ahead and hit play we've actually constructed the full UI that I showed you in just a matter of minutes I mean it's it's that quick so thanks for watching this tutorial i hope that you want to see more on the unity GUI and that you are as excited about this as I am so thanks again for watching and I'll see you in the next video
