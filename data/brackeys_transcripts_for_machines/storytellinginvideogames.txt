it's often considered ideal for gameplay and storytelling to sort of go hand in hand for me at least that's very important I mean we all know the feeling of being in the middle of an awesome game you're shooting stuff reloading charging at your opponent and suddenly unskipable cutscenesthat's Ori is uninteresting but when it interrupts the experience of the game you're playing it starts to feel like an obstruction or as if it's been added on top of an already existing game that's why it's often a good idea to try to incorporate this story into other aspects of it games design they're of course a million different ways to do this but in this video I'm going to highlight a few games that I personally think do it very well so let's get started one of the most simple ways of telling a story is to do exactly that tell it the narrator in Thomas was alone brilliant voiced by Danny Wallace tells the story of a group of colored rectangles on a journey to find purpose and he does so in past tense this all seemed a little dangerous the world was not to be trusted this makes for a very linear way of giving narrative to the player the player can simply lean back and passively let the story unfold as they go along the narrator tells the story from Thomas's point of view yet he often informs the player about what the other characters are thinking and feeling her continued existence was breaking some kind of natural order this is a very direct way of storytelling the narrator explicitly says what the characters feel and think it's actually kind of genius because being a oneman studio this allows Mike Bissell to communicate emotion using very simple visual elements added up with a lot of humor thomas was alone is an example of how even colored rectangles can be the subjects of interesting storytelling Stanley's parable on the other hand is a game that changes this simple way of narration this game is in no way linear the play is constantly presented with choices they have to make and these choices will have further consequence on the rest of the game and this is where the writing of the game excels because no matter what the player chooses the narrator always has an opinion about it you really still in the broom closet standing around doing nothing Bonnie please offer me some explanation here I'm genuinely confused it almost feels like you're breaking the rules of the game when you are faced with two doors and choose to walk through the one on the right while the narrator is explicitly telling you that he entered the door and is left the game is filled with these kinds of contradictions it served to both confuse the player and create a very surreal experience of playing the game and more importantly creating this story eight four five but of course Stanley couldn't possibly have known this yet incredibly by simply pushing random buttons on the keypad Stanley happened to input the correct code by sheer luck amazing as it happens Stanley's parable has 19 achievable endings and the players actions throughout the game have direct influence on which one they'd get this to me is one of the most unique ways of storytelling allowing the player to create their own I think something that is often underestimated is the importance of perspective in video games experiencing a game in firstperson can let the players see and act from another person's point of view some games take advantage of this by spending a lot of time developing the player character while others take the opposite approach by giving away almost no information about the character they make it easier for the player to project themselves onto them if done right this can help eliminate the boundary between the player and the game halflife 2 is a great example of this Gordon Freeman being completely silent is a way of not giving him personality also halflife 2 never breaks the firstperson point of view much like in real life the information you get about the story doesn't come from a line of text magically appearing in front of you but from observing the world around you the game doesn't tell you what to do instead it places you in a world and lets you figure out for yourself what you want to make of it in its article on the subject jake shapiro gives an example of how this is actually done a cop stops you deliberately knocks over a soda can and orders you to pick it up refused and the cop will be this is a great way to teach the players something as basic as which Keys pick up and throw objects but if you think about it it does so much more than that it shows us the play one of the key features of the game story the people are being terrorized and forced to follow orders and what's also extremely interesting is how the game makes it appear as if picking up the can is a free choice this makes the play feel like they're responsible for driving the story forward which in turn keeps the player invested in the game another game that does a great job immersing the player and making them feel like they're the one playing the game is an old favorite of mine the portal series how can valve be so amazing at this just like in halflife 2 the protagonist Chell is completely silent you can only see her through the portals she places one of the most important characters of the game GLaDOS is an example of using the same element for multiple narrative purposes first of all GLaDOS is one of the main characters and she has a rich interesting personality for the player to explore but at the same time she's also the narrator in some ways the classic allknowing narrator that we've seen Thomas was alone but allowing GLaDOS personality and her own evil agenda to sort of peep through the seemingly innocent narration is a really clever trick and it helps make the story flow incredibly well the enrichment and reminds you that Android hell is a real place she isn't just some free recorded voice GLaDOS is there with you commenting on your actions as you go along mocking you all your other friends couldn't come either because you don't have any other friends because of how unlikable you are this is the sort of writing that plays a major role in keeping the player interested and engaged another game that is interesting in terms of storytelling is heavy rain credit by david cage this game has no immediate game over state instead the action should take and how you perform during the game influenced the narrative and how the story ends if you think about it this is actually a great way for the player to become invested in the story much like in real life you don't get another chance instead you have to do your best through a series of situations and the outcome of each situation actually has an impact on the future narrative what a brilliant way for the player the story and the game to come all together but in the end it's not always necessary to play around with the possibilities and structures of video games to tell a good story now plenty examples of games that utilize what you might call classic narrative structure really well these games make use of a bunch of elements like cutscenes text and dialogue to effectively tell a story a great example of this is the muchloved The Last of Us so in conclusion video games is a great platform for telling a story there's so much you can do with it but the best way of telling a story is always going to depend on the setting the gameplay and of course the story itself that's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe so dome is the
