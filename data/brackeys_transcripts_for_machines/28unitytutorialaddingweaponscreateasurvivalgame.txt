hello everyone and welcome to video number 28 in our Survival game series done by Braes I the CEO of Braes and in this video we are going to be importing three new weapons to our game uh made by some cool people I'm going to talk about in a sec and uh this is what they look like so here you go and um so we're going to be importing them and we're going to be building the base of our uh updated um M system uh basically it's going to allow the weapons to move with the animation of of our arms and it's also going to be optimized uh for the upcoming inventory system uh so that's really awesome so uh basically let me just start out with explaining the idea of what we are going to be doing uh so again uh I excuse my drawing skills uh but here we go in paint um the base is this uh so this is a top view of our player capsule just ignore the weapon for now uh and we can see the two two arms going out here uh they are kind of squary okay so we have this uh point on the right hand arm and this is part of the rig uh and the rig is basically the skeleton that allows for uh the arms to animate and that's what I made in blender and uh inside of the rig or the skeleton I made an empty game object that would always uh follow the base of our hand and so we can actually parent uh weapons to this game object and then it will automatically follow the animation uh so that's what that is and uh in order for us to do this uh we would like to instantiate weapons to this point whenever we pick something up or equip something from from our inventory and such so uh we would like to just be able to instantiate in the um in basically a zero position and a zero rotation so um we don't have to uh adjust the position or rotation of the individual weapons and in order to do this I had to centry the pivot point or Anchor Point in all of the weapons and what that's what I've done here so the Anchor Point on all of the weapons uh is where we want to hold it uh so that should all be aligned and so we can have all the weapons uh just simply snap onto there and uh that's the base of what we are going to be doing today so uh first of all I would like uh if you could download the survival game assets pack from our website uh if you want to use the arms or the the the arms or the weapons I'm using uh if you're unaware on how how to do this you can go ahead and watch our bonus video showing just that okay so open up the folder go under Imports and then on the weapons we see a folder called Old weapons these were the uh the two old weapons the Maze and the sword uh we're just going to be ignoring those as they are kind of outdated and they were just placeholder art and uh let's start by importing the iron U Maze and that's that one and this was made by samine iben from blend control and if you're looking for some great free modeling work um he's uh he's really awesome check him out uh so let's start by importing that and uh we have both a blend file and a fbx file I'm just going to be importing the blender file uh because this allows me to quickly open it up through unity and make changes uh but if you don't have blender you can just use the BX you'll get the same result so let's open up unity and just uh navigate to the right folder here so that we have our player and then under our Imports we can go to the weapons and then we will make a new folder create folder and call this old weapons then select The Sword and the Maze and just drag them onto the old weapons now let's make uh another folder and call this iron maze double click it and then we can just drag in the iron ma blend file and the three textures and there we have it awesome uh actually I'll quickly rename this to maze handle diffuse and then maze head diffuse I just like naming it diffuse because there are plenty of different texture types and these are defuse awesome actually the talkers not only but that we'll just ignore that for now okay so now we can just uh drag in the iron Maze and uh see if the scale is proper it's not it's a little bit too big so let's select the iron maze in the inspector or in the project pane and then go to the inspector and change the scale factor down to let's try 07 let's try that I really don't know that's still way too big so let's change this to 0.3 that doesn't look too bad let's try to move it up here we'll just go with that for now and then we can make adjustments later okay so what we're going to do now is we're going to apply the the textures so just hit if to focus on it then right click the animator and hit remove component or you can just go to the iron maze go under animations and uncheck import animation hit apply go to Rick generic and hit none apply go and do model and then I want to uh and this is this is a matter of preference you can easily import the noral so you can calculate them and uh it's really different whether what looks best um actually I think for this one we're going to import them uh I think that looks a little bit better but again that's something we can adjust along the way uh now let's select the iron Maze and now we can start dragging in some textur so on the maze handle we drag in the Maze handle diffuse and change this to completely white on the maze head we'll drag in the Maze head diffuse completely wi and the same with the stand drag in completely wide that's awesome uh but maybe for the maze head we would like it to be a bit more shiny uh so if that's the case you could go ahead and change the maze head Shader type from diffuse to specular and now we can get that specular detail on just that part of the Maze and that's why we have split it up like this and you can of course adjust the shininess and such variables to to see how it reflects light and how it influences and so that's pretty awesome now I I like this a lot so let's now begin to actually add this to the arms so what we can do now is we can select our arms hit uh F to focus on them then go on the arms and now we will start uh browsing the the rig so the Armature and there are going to be a lot of game objects under this but uh you really can just ignore all of them except for the ones I'm using here so arm amateure Master inner arm right because we want to equip to the right hand arm right hand right and then the hold ride and that's uh that's the one we're going to be using though you will notice if you just drag the maze under the hold right and then just zero out the position and the rotation is not really looking too great so what we can do is we can make an empty game object onto the hold right that will be called melee and we can make uh and we can rotate that and so we can uh have all the weapons be rotated if you don't understand this yet that's completely fine I'm sure you will figure it out along the way so let's make an empty game object by either going to game object create empty or press contrl shift n let's call this melee and this is basically going to be a rout for the whole M system let's drag it under the hold and let's drag the iron maze under the meele now let's make sure the meele is centered 0 0 0 0 and also that the iron maze is centered on the M 0 0 oops that was nine 0 0 0 and zero now we can take the Mele object and just rotate it and if you want you can also snap by holding down control ra while rotating and this can just allow for some pretty nice snapping and now we can go in and fine tune this so I would like it to be more to the right it's very very much at an angle right now and maybe a bit back like this zoom in some more so we can see what we're doing move it a bit bit upward and a bit out and that doesn't look too bad let's see how it looks in game so go into game and then hit play and we can see that the maze is behind the hand even though in our scene it looks just right and that's because uh if you have watched tutorial 20 number number 26 I believe uh where we take care of weapon clipping uh we made a secondary camera that will always make sure our hands are drawn so that they don't won't clip through other objects if collided um but we we have to add our our weapon here to that layer uh so what we're going to do is we're going to go under melee and then change the layer to draw always and let say yes change children and this will also change our iron maze uh or anything else we have under the Mele object uh though I'm pretty sure if you drag something under there now you still have to change the layer okay so now let's have a look again hit play and that looks really awesome I think uh we could maybe scale down the maze a bit to see more of the top but that's really up to you I'm just going to leave it here for now Okay cool so next up we are going to import yet another weapon so go back to the weapons folder hit create folder and then let's call this Axe and this axxe was made by uh one of the uh guys that were working on your game a really talented modeler called igle and we're going to have a link to his portfolio as soon as we get it up but that's the one there uh so let's go under the um weapons here under the axe and then select the blend file and the ax diffuse and just drag it on the ax there let's double click it and there we have it uh so let's drag this in and we can see this is really really big so let's just go ahead and select it in the project pane change the scale factor to something like 0.09 let's try with that just guessing uh where we have it we have it there so let's focus on it that wasn't too bad actually I kind of like that scale it might it's still too big yeah so let's go and do 0.06 and uh that looks pretty good maybe 0.05 it's all right if the weapons are a little bit too small it looks better uh when you can see more of the weapon I think but again it's up to you it's a matter of preference of course so now selected in the project pane uh then you can see let's see if we want this to be automatically imported I think we would like to calculate this one yeah I kind of like that better but we'll see when we once we get the textures on go to RI none and let's just hit try again then go to animation and uncheck import animation and hit apply okay great so now that we have those set up let's uh get it to fit our hand there uh so now we can just go ahead and drag it on our me and we can remember to change the layer to draw always then go to the position zero out the variables also rotation Soo them out and now we should see that they align though I see there are a small problem here and uh what we can do is we can simply take our melee object here and just rotate it that way so now it should be pointing forwards and when we import our knife the blade should be twoo great so you can see that these weapons automatically align and so if we were to disable the iron maze it's not looking too bad of course he's never going to be holding it just perfect but I think that is really close okay so now let's drag on the diffused texture and change this to completely white and there we have it now we have our axe in game also and uh that's awesome okay so now let's uh let's just quickly see how it looks in game not too bad uh also you might want to see that these follow any kind of Animation we're doing so if we go under our animator you will be able to see the setup we made in mechm in the last two tutorials and if we had play we can do stuff like uh oops this is not working so what we can do is we can go this is might be the wrong controller I've selected so let's go into the arms hit the arms controller there much better and also remember that um mechanim has a box so that's just uncheck apply root motion and now we can see the animation playing and when we hit the hit one you can see it starts swinging the weapon the same with hit two that looks great and when we run it also follow the hands so that's awesome and uh that is working great so now under the Mele uh let's import the last weapon so let's go and do Imports weapons and then create new folder call this knife and uh the knife was made by me and I am really really good at modeling um uh I think it's the best one definitely uh okay so the knife here uh select the blend file and the knife diffuse texture and let's just drag it onto the knife folder double click the knife folder to open it up there we have it and then that's uh I don't know about the tangents let we'll yet we'll see about that uh the skill fact is probably off though so let's try to drag it in there no that's right kidding uh okay so we can just bump down the skill factor quite a bit uh let's try 0.1 that doesn't look too bad let's focus on it guess we'll have to have him holded before we can really see but that's actually not too bad so uh for some reason this already has the texture applied but you can of course go ahead and just drag it on there change this to completely white select it in the project pain go on the rig select none hit apply animations unche import animation and the model there uh okay so I think the tangents are actually not too bad though I don't really like this shattering by the edge of the blade so let's go ahead and hit calculate and that should get rid of it yes it did great now we can go ahead and just drag it onto the Mele and you know the progress just uh s out the positions through out the rotation and now it should look just right and if we disable the axe we can have a look at it in game and uh whoops we forgot one thing select the knife go to layer draw always and now it should look just right actually this might be a little bit too low on the hand so of course what you can do because this is a blend file is you can just double click it and it will open it up in blender and that's awesome so now we can just move it up a tiny bit in edit mode which won't affect our pivot hit save and this is of course done in the um version you're downloading and now it should be perfectly centered yeah there we go so that was basically it for this video guys let's just quickly maybe go ahead and make some prefabs out of these if you want to um I'm not going to do that but you can do it if you want and uh in the next one we're going to be uh affecting the animation uh through scripting so we are going to be learning how to uh get this to play um in game and uh we I'm also thinking about doing some fall damage tutorials and maybe uh and then of course the inventory system and upcoming is also some more combat and uh there's a lot of exciting things on the way don't know when don't know how but uh it will get there sometime so stay tuned and thank you for watching
