so if you want to make music for your game there's a billion different ways to go about it and there's so many different programs to help you with it today we'll be looking at one that is super quick and easy to use it's called buzz sketch something it's a great tool I've used it for a lot of game jams so let's go ahead and get started so to get started go to busca coed i will have a link in the description for those of you who don't want to spell that here you can choose between the online version we're downloading to your computer I find the online version works pretty well but I always like having it on my system let's hit download choose a platform and it's going to start downloading on windows it will download as a zip file so simply unzip that and you should get a folder with an exe that we can go ahead and open up so here's what it looks like some people get a bit confused about the interface but let's just start from the beginning let's begin by hitting new song we then choose the BPM which is our tempo I'm going to set this down to 80 we can also select how many notes we want to make of a pattern what we're looking at here is one pattern and inside of a pattern we can place notes so here's the amount of notes that will make up our pattern and the small number is how many notes we want to make up a bar so if we change this to say 8 you can see that we now have 2 bars of 8 notes each most songs are written in 4/4 which means that we will have 4 notes each was the length of 1/4 a bar so we'll just leave that at 4 16 and now we can start placing notes by simply clicking and dragging you can start and pause playback by hitting this space key and you can remove notes by right clicking if you want to control the length of your note we use the scroll wheel some people can find it really daunting to have all of these different options well the music that we normally listen to is set in a certain scale we can think of a scale as a selection of some of these notes that go well together and we can define a scale by going to the bottom right corner and first selecting a key this is going to be the base note for our scale then we can choose what scale most of the music that we listen to I they said in major or minor major often giving a happy feel and minor more face sad feel but there are lots of others to choose from like blues and all the pentatonic scales along with some more exotic ones we'll just set ours to major and you can see now that it's really narrowed down the possibilities that we have in terms of notes and so now we should be able to just go nuts placing no along the scale and have it sound okay so let's make a short song I'm going to use my scroll wheel to make a bigger note and then going to create AC chord that's c e g and then going to make a D minor chord that's D F and then a let's follow that up with the G that's G B and D the last chord here is pretty stretched out from the rest of them and in general it tends to sound better if chords are close to each other we can actually just take the G here and raise it to the octave above so we simply go and select the G up here now the notes are much closer and we can have a listen so the sound that we're currently using is really bad let's go into instrument and here we can change the sound of our instrument this is a tiny bit weird because the first tab here allows you to choose an instrument and then the second one allows you to choose a sound however for the instrument MIDI which is not actually an instrument but a technique for triggering audio well then in here we have different categories as well so just remember that you can always go into MIDI to get more options I just want to hit the plus sign here in order to cycle through I think this sound is pretty good however it's a bit too clear on the high notes to get rid of those we can use this lowpass filter if I play and start adjusting this you can hear that we can cut off a bunch of frequencies for the sound and we can do this for any instrument so when you've chosen a sound that you're happy with let's go ahead and add another instrument to do that we hit add new instrument for this one I want a bass so that's going to change the instrument to a bass and I just want to use the analog bass notice how you can also fine tune the volume of each instrument over here however I don't want to write my bass line on top of our chords so let's go into arrangement and here we can see how we can combine different patterns in order to make up our song we have our first pattern here which sour chord progression we then hit add new select the new pattern click on the new pattern to selected and you can see our colored changes we can also see that at the bottom left here this pattern is using the analog bass but we could easily have the second pattern use the electric piano as well so we can always swap between those down here you'll notice that if you place a note and hit play it's not playing the reason why is that we also need to insert our pattern into the arrangement so let's start by only playing the chords let's then play both the chords and the bass to copy the chords we can simply drag on them and then we can go from there but again if we hit play it's just going to loop the first chord let's look us down here you can see what part of this song we currently want to play we can click on a particular bar or we can click and drag to play a longer part of the song so in our case let's just click on the second bar here so we can hear what our chord will sound like with our bass so bass is currently playing a really high note this is not really what we're going for well you can navigate through tone height by going to the right and pressing up or down or you could use WS or even the up and down arrow keys I always just have my hands placed on the keyboard ready to press wns let's now remove this note and let's try placing one down here that sounds a lot better also remember to change the scale for this instrument as well so let's set that to major so let's write our bass serious what mine sounds like let's add a melody on top let's go instrument add a new instrument this could definitely be a chip tune and it's just started with the square wave now let's go back into our arrangement let's add a new pattern it's automatically selected the square wave so that's good let's make another duplicate of our chord and of our bass let's now add this new pattern on top let's also make sure to preview that region and change the scale to major also when listening through the song before and notice our chords were a bit bright let's select the pattern and it's maybe shift these an octave down we could go and write all of the chords again or we could use the plus and minus here at the bottom so 1st chord starts at the C let's then hit the minus key until we get to the lower C let's now have a listen again that's so much better all right so let's construct a melody we could definitely add some more texture to this so I've gone ahead and added an extra layer to this melody I definitely like this however the melody is currently taking over the whole piece let's go into the instrument let's try and play around with the sound so I really like the dual square for this one finally let's add some drums that's it add new instrument let's choose drum kit I think we'll just go with the simple drum kit let's then go on to the arrangement let's add a new pattern let's also drag this in notice that we don't have any scale controls here that's because the different notes map to different drums so we have three different bass drums two snares to high hats and a crash let's start by adding in some bass drum it's also throwing a snare and the hihat here can be pretty dominating but I definitely want to have some in there I'll even throw in a crash on the four finally we probably want to add some variation to our stock because we're simply reusing the same patterns this will quickly become very repetitive but the program actually makes variation really easy to do let's add a variation to a melody to do that instead of simply clicking and dragging we use the middle mouse button and then drag now it's created a duplicate of that pattern and we can go in and edit specific notes let's also bring over all of our other tracks set the play back to this particular bar and just change around a few things even though almost all of our elements are the same having just the melody very will really help keep things interesting so now let's listen to our entire arrangement awesome from here on out it's just about adding more patterns creating more variation and combining different patterns in order to create new interesting results also whenever you're doing a song that is based on patterns like this it's a good idea to throw in a break once in a while or maybe even the contrast piece where something completely different happens I also just want to show you that if you go to advanced you can actually add swing to your sound but this is probably going to sound horrible for our song but if you're going for that swing jazz feel try bumping this up it's not great for this one finally to export your song go to file export and here we can choose between the wav file which is an audio file or a MIDI file if you want to load it into a MIDI editor if you want to import this into a game engine you would probably select the first one if I'm going to play through your entire song while it's exporting and at the end we can choose where to save it that's it save and we now have a song clip that you can share with your friends or throw into a game that's pretty much everything for basket seal I just want to leave you with one very very very important note and that is to always remember to save your CL file and do this a lot of time while making it so this is the project file that you can then later load up make sure to do this because for some stupid stupid reason this program will close if you click on something wrong it will create a new song and sometimes might even crash and it's not going to prompt you or anything it just does so I've lost so much work because I forgot to save so please please do that that's also the only issue I've had on that have fun guys let's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it
