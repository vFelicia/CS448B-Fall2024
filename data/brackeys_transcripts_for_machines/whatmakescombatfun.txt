a central part of video games is combat whether you're killing computercontrolled zombies in left 4 dead or doing PvP in DotA combat can be both exhilarating and fun now what makes something fun can be a hard thing to grasp everything came across a great article by mag Birkhead which tries to break this down so according to mic player actions in combat is made up of three steps first step is to form a goal you then choose an intention which means how you want to achieve this goal and last you generate the sequence of actions needed to realize the intention so let's say your goal is to kill your opponent your intention could then be to use your sword to kill him and the action sequence could be to pull out your sword walk up to your opponent and hit a tag a bunch of times now this example might seem obvious and if all combat in a game played out using these exact steps it would quickly become repetitive and boring so what do you do to make this more interesting is provide the player with multiple valid intentions if the player has multiple ways of solving a problem and reaching a goal they will start to feel that the game has more depth but providing the player with more options is not enough in itself just filling up your games with empty mechanics will make it feel bloated and tedious now this is where constraints come in constraints are used to strategically limit the amount of valid intentions that player has in a given situation in other words we are making different intentions more likely of success based on three types of constraints the goal the environment and the opponent let's have a look at an example where these constraints play in so if you ever played what the four craft you probably know that the Warlock class used to be provided with a large number of spells in general this could be split up into two major intentions you could choose to focus on the damage over time spells or you could focus on the direct damage spells what intention gave the best outcome completely depended on the constraints if you are facing a warrior the best way to avoid dying was to keep a good distance here could use the insta casts damage over time spells while running away and making sure to stay out of melee range eventually the warrior would run out of health and you could start spamming an insult of your choosing if you are facing a major on the other hand you had to use a completely different tactic which meant changing your intention here the damage over time spells weren't nearly as effective because the mage had the ability to remove them instead it was more effective to burst him down using the heavy hitting direct damage spells this is a good example of where the type of opponent you're dealing changes the intention but there are other factors that play a big role in what intention to choose so r√•sunda facing worry was standing above him on a Ledge now we're dealing with an environmental context here could freely cast your direct damage spells without any fear of the warrior getting close and what the major isn't bothered by you standing on the ledge environment still plays a big role here because the warlock has a lot of instant cast abilities it makes it easy to pop out use a bunch of abilities and go back to hiding this makes it really hard for a mage to hit you in terrain with many obstacles because he has to worry about line of sight on his slow casting abilities now that got a bit technical but I think it's a great example of how you have to consider both your opponent and the environment in order to choose the correct strategy what's great about combat that takes this into consideration is that it rewards experienced players because of their ability to make calculated decisions of course when you add this type of complexity to a game it can be hard for new players to get started because they simply don't have the knowledge of all the classes and abilities that go into choosing the right intention I consider this both a weakness and a strength of many modern date games especially games like dota or League of Legends are known for being notoriously hard to learn this can make it extremely frustrating for new players trying to learn the game but also really rewarding for the more experienced players but we also see newer games that go in the opposite direction instead for writing depth by adding more opponent types and abilities these games may come at interesting by focusing on the coal or environment a good example of this is rocket League of course the overall goal is simple you want to score as many goals on your opponent as possible without them scoring on you but depending on the placement of the players in the environment your goal and intentions change drastically or any of your allies close to you what is the placement of your opponents where are you in relation to the ball these are just a few examples of questions you need to ask about the environment before you can decide on a goal and how to accomplish it but rocket League also uses a particular element really well I'm talking about urgency because the game is so centered around being at the right place at the right time speed becomes very important some goals might not be very urgent like getting in position for a good defense and allow you to pick up boost along the way though a lot of the time situations are very urgent so if you're racing to get in position to convert a good pass in to scoring a goal so with this in mind we also have to take in consideration like what speed is the ball traveling at and in what direction and do you have enough boost to make it in time in general shooters take good use of the environment to add constraints if you think your opponent is waiting for you around a corner you might decide to throw a flashbang before running out and shooting him if you know a sniper is lying in wait you probably want to stay away from open areas and stay largely hidden behind cover I find that analyzing games in this way can really help narrow down what's important when designing combat for games within a particular genre it's definitely something that I'll keep in mind next time I'm laying out a level or adding a new ability to one of my own games so if this video gave you some ideas on how you can make combat fun in your games feel free to share your own ideas on the subject in the comments of course this video is a bit unusual in that it focuses on game design instead of the more technical side definitely let me know if you like this format and if there's anything I could do to improve it on that thanks watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to all the awesome patreon supporters who donated in
