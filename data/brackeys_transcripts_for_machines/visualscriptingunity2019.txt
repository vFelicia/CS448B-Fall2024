so unitedly was a few weeks ago and I must admit that after watching the keynote I wasn't particularly impressed of course the video FX graph looks amazing and we did get to hear more about ECS but for me that was mostly it however that completely changed after unity held their broad map talk in the road map unity announced so many new features that I think are fundamentally going to change the way that people use unity it seems to me that 2019 is just going to be a year where unity ties up a lot of loose ends this is of course really exciting to see since a lot of this stuff has been talked about for such a long time and I think it's going to make unity better for both programmers and artists so let's have a look at what's coming to unity in the near future but first this video is sponsored by race and I who work with unity to create an awesome free plugin called unity visual search unity visual search allows you to find the perfect 3d assets for your project on the unity asset store with the help of resinize AI powered engine unity visual search understand precise structure and geometry so you can easily find visuals similar objects to the ones already in your scene you can even filter searches by price polygon count and number of materials not only does unity visual search help you find the perfect assets it also lets you preview and play around with them inside of your unity scene so if you're looking for highquality game ready assets that will help you build beautiful prototypes in no time you've gotta check this out unity visual search is a completely free plugin so I definitely recommend you click the link in the description and try it out so ladies and gentlemen fasten your seat belts and get ready for takeoff because who put this in here who talks like this it came to video another party so without a doubt the biggest feature is that unity announced and unite is Vishal scripting that's right visual scripting is coming to unity one of the biggest reasons for people to choose unreal over unity has always been unreal blueprints a visual scripting solution is just a great tool for artists or non programmers in general who needs to modify the game without needing to write and understand csharp code frankly I'm a bit surprised that we're only seeing a building solution for this now given how many people have requested over the years regardless it's going to be really interesting to see how unity chooses to implement this feature and how much it's going to borrow from existing solutions like blueprints or both so far unity is promising a preview release in 2019 point two with more features being added in 2019 point three it looks like it's gonna have what you would expect from a modern visual scripting tool with inclusion of live editing which is definitely really cool I'm just really excited to see how this tool is going to be received by the community next up we have some updates to the package manager this includes a UI overhaul the ability to install and host packages using git and with 2000 19.3 we will see asset store support they're also planning to add a project browser that will make it easier to search for and navigate through packages both locally and on the asset store now in version 2019 point 1 the old unity launcher is finally being replaced by unity hub also your new hub 2.0 comes with a new UI and with that a dark mode can also support CLI and features advanced templates which allow you to search categorize and customize your templates and unity hub finally allows us to interact with the project based on that the entire asset import pipeline is getting replaced which means yes much less waiting for huge projects to load and that's all I have to say about that and now to something unity has never done before redesigned their entire editor the unity has talked about this before but we are slowly gathering more information this means new icons a new font that is adjustable in text size and hover state controls to give a more responsive UI also it seems to have a much more flat look than the current editor at first I didn't really like it but the more pictures I see I must admit that it's growing on me but isn't it always like this with new UI also judging by the slide shown stuff like the train system Pro filter and poly brush all being integrated into the new editor this is such a needed change since all these tools are currently completely independent and frankly a bit weird to use and along with a new editor design we are also getting new ways that we can customize and extend it through code as of 2019 point 2 we will be using UI elements to build editor tools for the new UI UI elements is going to have some really nice improvements to the old system such as CSS support and more performant UI renderer and runtime preview and along with completely redesigning the editor unity is also adding a shortcut manager from version 2019 point one unity allows you to create your own shortcuts for pretty much any action you would like it even has its own API now this might not seem like a big deal but I think it's going to improve the general unity workflow and make it much easier for advanced users to speed up their process and now something that has been needed for such a long time a new input system I think we can all agree that unit is current way of setting up input is pretty much horrible you have this large list of input that is hard to manage and each input is so easy to mess up the new input system improves this a lot and it's actually been available on github for quite a while now basically it adds the ability to group to get the input using action maps find input to actions and add combos you can also add processors to the input to do stuff like adjust sensitivity or add dead cells as for the terrain improvements I'm still not impressed by what unity is showing us there of course a bunch of performance improvements in two thousand eighteen point three and in two thousand nineteen point one they are adding to rain falls but if that's all they currently have planned for the future I think it's a bit underwhelming of course I completely understand that it takes time to lay a new solid foundation for a system like this but I'd still like to hear that a complete tool redesign is at least on the roadmap especially when it comes to texture painting at least we know that unity has now assembled a team that only focuses on terrain now one of the big things that have been missing in terms of 2d has been dedicated to the lighting but with 2000 19.1 we can expect to see 2d lights and shadows including 2d shape based lights point lights and spotlights now I'm really excited about this but looking at the example footage in unity showed in the talk I'm actually a bit confused as to what it means we've always been able to use 3d lights together with a lid shader to achieve effects that look similar to what we see here now I'm sure that the new system is going to be more performant and being able to create shape based lights is definitely really cool but one of the big myths things for me has always been a way to do shadows similar to what a plugin like to DDL does and I'm not currently seeing that here if anyone knows more about this or have any thoughts definitely let me know in the comments because I'd love to know more so these are the main features that unity will be implementing in 2019 but I think there are still a few features that are worth mentioning unity 2019 point two comes with improvements to the console window already in 2018 point three unities adding physical camera support to cinema scene ECS is getting more integrated with actual scene editing and a simplified api the first compiler is heading towards a version 1 release last but not least project tiny is set to launch at the end of December and that's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe and bring that notification valve so you don't miss the next one also definitely continue the feature hype over at discord GG / practice also don't forget to try out unity visual search it's completely free
