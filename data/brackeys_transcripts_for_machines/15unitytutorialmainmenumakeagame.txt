thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to video number 15 in how to make a game a cool series of making a video game in unity wow it's been such a long time since the last one um I'm of course sorry that it's it's been such a while uh but I've had a lot of cool stuff to do in the meantime so since the last video I've started a series called how to make a 2d platform which I really think you should check out also started a series called um how to program in C SHP which is great if you want to make the transition transition from JavaScript to C or if you just want to become sharper on your language skills and also I've uh started a a smaller series covering some of the new stuff introduced with unity 4.6 beta because Unity 4.6 has has been released as a public beta and along with it the all new Unity guy system which is what we're going to be using today so today we're going to be creating this cool menu I can hit play here and you can see that we have a slider to adjust the Music Volume a play game button and a quit game button today we're not going to be making uh the actual uh sort of events happen when you actually interact with the menu but we will be setting it up like this um so before we get started I just quickly want to say that today's wallpaper can be downloaded at bra.com wallpapers the cool character here was made by a guy called Camilo also if you have any questions please head over to forum. bra.com where I among many other developers are just waiting to answer your questions and then of course if you want to download this uh beta head over to unity3d.com and go under Unity 4.6 beta and you can download it for free here so that was it for the amazingly long intro now we can go ahead and get started with today's video so I'm just going to go ahead and and delete the scene here and load up the level that we uh we had when we left last and what we're going to do is we are first off going to duplicate this because we're going to be using many of the same elements so let's just selected in the uh project panel and hit contrl D and we can rename this to main menu now let's make sure to double click this so that we are in the main menu scene and uh let's go into the scene View and have a look at what we what is going on here so let's find our ball and hit F to focus on it now we can select uh all the platforms except one so we're just going to select all them here and just leave the one in the center then we can select the coin also and delete that we also going to delete the GM object and uh on the main camera here we are going to remove the camera control script so just hit remove component on that now let's with the camera selected let's just zoom bit in on the game object here let's move the camera up a bit and then let's rotate it uh along the Z oh no that's going to be the xaxis here so the red ring just going to rotate it down a bit and maybe move it even more up so it's going to look something like this uh we can go ahead and uh shift from local to Global uh orientation so we can move it up on the correct axis something like that looks pretty good uh I just want to make some room for the actual menu items up here so just have it kind of a uh just have the sky boox as a backdrop and then this to accompan the uh the main menu itself this looks pretty good and you will notice that we can still roll around with the ball which I think is a pretty fun little thing to be able to do in a menu now next up we are going to be using the unity so uh if you find anything to be difficult along the way here I suggest you go ahead and hit up uh the uh the guy specific videos that I've done lately um they should be quite a help so now we can right click in the hierarchy go under UI and let's just create a button and you can see that once we create this button three things are actually created a canvas which is uh kind of which represents the screen so the the total screen area that you have to uh you you've got to play with then we have a button which is the button and then an event system which is automatically created with any GUI this allows us to interact with the GUI system all of these are important so please don't delete any of them cool so what we want to do is we want to focus in on this canvas so go into 2D mode hit select the canvas and hit f and now we can zoom in so this is our screen we can select our button and maybe uh change the anchor so go up here on the the anchor presets and hit the top uh middle here that one so the flower looking anchor here is going to be moved to the center of the top and uh now let's scale this button up a bit so just drag in one of the corners hold down alt and hold down shift and then maybe just scale it a bit up here also uh that might be a bit too big let's just scale it down a bit again something like that now we can take our text here and uh we can go ahead and change the font size to something like 24 and we can change the text to play game and I'm just going to do this with capital letters that looks pretty cool now we can take our button and we can move it up and move it a bit to the left so just something like that looks pretty cool and uh yeah I'm actually pretty satisfied with that now we can go ahead and select the button and over here on the right hand side you can see that we have an image component and under the source image you can see that it has the uh default guey Sprite selected I'm just going to choose none instead because I don't want any of these Corners I don't really like the look of them uh and then I'm going to going to take the color and make it completely black but still keep the alpha value at something like 150 then we can go under the button select the text and let's just change the color here to completely white we could also go ahead and make this a bold text what you can also do is go under the canvas and select Pixel Perfect though uh I'm not going to be doing this here um for reasons I won't go into in this video so what we can do now is we can um we have this nice looking button let's just duplicate it to the other and move it to the other side here so we also have a quit game button let's select it hold down shift d oh it's control D I believe yeah command D if you're on a Mac now let's move it hold down shift while you move it to constrain it to one axis and you can move it over here but even better what we can do is we can simp simply remove the negative the minus here from our exp position and it will'll move it over and it even illustrates what we just changed you can see it says 144 here and it has this uh this line showing how we've moved it and that's because our position X Y and Z is always relative to our Anor which is up here so this is a 444 uh units from our origin to the anchor and that's completely correct now we can go under this button and we can change the text to quid game oops no space and that's basically it so now we have two cool looking buttons and you will notice that when we uh uh play the game and hover over them they will indeed animate which is pretty cool next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a slider with a label so let's go under the canvas let's right click hit UI and then uh let's do slider and uh let's go into the scene view again here let's again move the anger to the top uh middle here change the anger preset there now we can move up the slider something like there again holding down shift you only move on one axis now we can drag here while holding down alt to drag on both sides sides and uh just drag it over so it snaps nicely with the buttons then what we can do is we can make a little bit of room for our uh label so just move it in a bit there now let's go ahead and change uh the default value so go down here to value with the slide you selected and let's maybe do 0.6 or 7 for the default music um or let's actually make this maybe the general audio slider we could do that you could also make it the music H I don't know it's up to you uh but the default value is going to be 0.7 so what we can also do is we can change the appearance of this a bit so it looks a little nicer because I don't really like the look of it as it is right now so the image here is going to be the background image you can see that if I color it red this is what uh the element looks like and again I want to change this from the default background Sprite to just none to make it just a fill color and we can maybe go ahead and darken this quite a bit maybe even darken it as much as the buttons so again completely dark and then an alpha of 150 then we can go on to the slider and you can see we have the fill area which is the fill that illustrates how much uh that kind of illustrates the slider value that's what I meant to say and then we have the handle which is this little element right here so let's go under the fill and select the fill uh object now again let's just select none as the Sprite I think that looks nicer and maybe just tar in the white here a bit um also what I actually want to go ahead and do is I want to change the alpha to uh 255 which means it's completely visible and then go drag the uh the uh the color down a bit you could also go ahead and make this this an actual uh color if you would like it to have some kind of of style um I actually might go ahead and and just do that let's make it this kind of uh San color looks Al almost like futuristic and then maybe just a tad down with the alpha that actually looks pretty cool now we can go ahead and select the handle slide area and uh just open that up expand that select the handle and again um you can go ahead and select none here but the end uh the handle Sprite I actually like okay um so let's just change the color in that bump up the uh the alpha completely I don't like the way these elements show underneath just bump it up all the way and then change the uh the color to something you like maybe experiment with the colors here no I'm going to make that completely wide just maybe tone it down just a tad something like this I think looks pretty nice and you will notice now that again our slider is animated so when we have hover over it and click it it will um change accordingly and uh everything is actually working so the last thing that we are going to do is just put in the label so to do this uh right click on the canvas again go into UI and now select just text and uh let's make this let's Center this on the Y AIS by pressing here we can then change the text to let's say audio could put volume in here we could also just do volume I'm going to do audio and then uh just a um a colon and uh let's change the color here to maybe completely black uh just making it more visible yeah I think that's pretty good we could also try try just a a white that's not really visible enough we could go ahead and put uh some effects on this but uh that's for another video so let's just make this completely black and um maybe even scale it up a bit so let's change the font size to something like 17 that looks a lot better uh and now we can just position it so just go over here move it up again change the aner to the top middle just like all the other elements and let's scale it in here we're going to have to change the slider just a bit to make it fit uh something like this look actually looks pretty nice and there you have it so um maybe we can just move the slider over and there yeah I'm actually pretty satisfied with that so that it's it's actually that simple to create uh menus or or elements inside of the new Unity 4 .6 gooey system so that's basically it for today's video in the next Mega game video we're going to expand on this by making the buttons and the slider actually do something I just completely forgot to add the music for our main menu so in order to do this simply drag the music prefab that we've already created into the hierarchy and music will play when you play the scene we will have a look at making this music seamlessly transition onto the next level when we actually Implement uh the the button events so that will be for a future video so again thanks for watching I'm looking forward to seeing what series you would uh prefer to see and uh yeah thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video yeah
