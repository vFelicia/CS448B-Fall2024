hello and welcome to video number 26 in our survival game series done by practice I'm the CEO of Brad keys and this video is going to be a rather short one we're gonna take a look at preventing weapon clipping so making it so that our weapon or our arms and and other you stuff attached to our player will not go through objects so that can be seen at any time and we also going to be making a few minor tweaks and fixes here and there so let's open up a unity as always first of all I just want to select my player and under here we have our main camera and under there we have our arms and it's these arms I want to make a separate layer then we can have a second camera just render that layer and then we can set it to depth only which will mean that they will be rendered no matter what no matter matter what so even though they're inside another object or behind another object we will still be able to see them so that's really cool so what we're going to do now is we are just going to take a look at what's inside our arms because everything that are inside of our arms will also be set to this layer and that means whenever we are going to equipped weapons to these arms that will also be be rendered by this cigarette be rendered by the secondary camera okay cool so what we're going to do now is we're going to select our player hit game object create other and then where we have it that camera and now let's like this too and rename it to something like weapon camera I'm gonna type draw always and then I'm going to drag that under the main camera and center the position and the rotation so that's really important you do that else everything is going to look pretty weird now we go to our clear flags and set this to depth only and the culling mask is something we're going to play with in a sec so now we can go ahead and select our arms go to the lair hit add layer call this draw always then select our arms again go up on the layer select our draw always layer hit yes change children and remember you have to do this with all the weapons too so set them to the layer draw always now we go and our main camera to make sure that it won't be drawn by our main camera because we won't do it won't we don't want to draw this two times so go under the culling mask and this is basically what it's going to draw and by drawing I of course mean a show and then we want to disable the draw always so now we see them disabled under the main camera here so if we were to go ahead and play the game right now you can see that it's not really working and it's all also pretty hard on the computer because we have two cameras drawing both things anyway so now we go under our draw always and then we want to disable these components because we don't need them we want them to be handled by our main camera so just remove component flour layer GUI layer and audio listener now we want to go under our depth and we want to change this to something higher than our main camera to one then we can go under our culling mask it's like nothing and then select the draw always and now it will only our hands as we can see here and now it should be working so if we hit play we can see our hands are being drawn and we have no error saying that there are more than one audio listening the scene they are only being drawn once and if we now run into a post or anything like that we can see that they are not clipping through so we can always see your hands and this is really something that has been standardized in the industry for a long long time because if we were to disable this camera go in the main camera and put back on the draw always you can see the arms going through objects so let's hit this back on main camera and then draw a long ways off okay cool so now that we had that setup I'm just going to make a few changes the first one I want to make is select our player select the graphics and then I want to apply a red color to this so that I can always find our player or any color you might like so now we go into our materials and I hit create material I'm going to call this maybe we should do a blue actually so blue then select our player graphics drag in the blue and now we can change the main color to blue and you can really pick whatever your color you want actually let's go with the black keys color so let's change this to purple or leather or yeah let's go with that that's really girly but that's what we're going to go with for now that just makes it easier to quickly fund I play out if we view it from a distance the last change I want to make is something you have been asking me to do and that's showing how to hide the slider you're up here if you're done with testing I think it's really nice to have it there whenever you're testing out levels because then you can quickly view them at different points in time but I'm just going to show you how to disable it so if we go on our day night cycle then under time of day we have our time of day script we can go ahead and open that up and it will load in monodevelop this is taking quite a while so let's just try this one more time there we have it and oh these are some scripts are used to make the inventory which is something we're going to cover in future videos the next one is probably going to be about making them so look forward to that but in the future we will get to the inventory I promise so now undo function on GUI we have the slider equals GUI horizontal slider and so on this is something you can just go ahead and delete or comment out so I'm just going to make these two dash signs and now when we save this and whoops we open two instances of monodevelop that so when we save this and hidden hit play you can see that it's not being drawn and the time of day will still change okay so now I'm going to show you how you can change the editor the script editor so if you are not interested in using monodevelop but would rather use something like notepad plus plus this is how you do it so you of course you start out by downloading the program and whenever you have it installed and this is what you do so you go to edit and then you go to preferences then you go to external tools then there you see the external script editor then we can click on this monodevelop and if it's not well in here you go to browse and then you find the location where you have installed it I think I installed mine on 2d programs then you find the notepad plus plus I actually might have installed it on the C program files notepad plus plus there you have it and then you select the application XE so we hit open and now we can see that that is a chosen here so we can go ahead and delete this for close this down and now when we go ahead to open the script so let's go into the scripts folder and let's just open up the advanced di you can see that's what opens up so now it opens up in notepad plus plus so that's pretty much it for this tutorial I know it was a short one but this was just a bunch of requests I have done V you guys I just thought I would clear up and get out of the way before we continue with the makin in parts so I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video
