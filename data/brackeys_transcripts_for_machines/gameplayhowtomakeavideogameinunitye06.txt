in this video we're going to be making some actual gameplay this what it should look like when we're done awesome so let's get started so what we're going to be doing here is pretty much creating a level by hand using a bunch of prefabs this allows us to really easily create interesting levels and fune each part of the level to a good difficulty setting the problem with this manual approach is that you cannot have infinite levels you're going to have a start and an end point if you want to create never ending levels I really suggest you watch my live stream on creating a Dodge the blocks type game in that video we randomly spawn obstacles from a few spawn points however making things procedural is a bit more difficult it does require some coding and unless you're very skilled with it it leaves you with very little customization when it comes to creating more deep and interesting levels anyway let's take our obstacle and drag it into our project what we just did was create a prefab of that obstacle prefabs are used whenever you want to have multiple objects of the same type in our case we want to have a lot of different obstacles in our scene what we can now do is take this prefab from the project and drag it in anywhere into our scene the cool thing is that if we now go to our obstacle and change a setting say the size on the xaxis you can see it updating on all of the objects at once I'm just going to undo that we can also edit one of these objects individually say select the first object here and change the mass we can then go up here and hit apply and it should now be applied to all the other prefabs and we can see indeed the mass has changed on those as well remember to always hit apply whenever you've changed something on the prefab that you want to be applied to the others again I'm going to put that back to two and hit apply the first thing that we need to do is extend our ground plane currently we can go for a little bit and then we're going to fall off of course there are ways of making our ground plane follow the position of our player one common thing to do when creating endless Runners is not actually move the player but instead move all of the obstacles and environment pieces closer to the player as the game progresses this way we can actually just have a stationary ground element but in our case we want to have some cool physics and that looks much better if we move the actual player so I think the solution here is as simple as just scaling up the ground let's take the ground give it a scale on the Z of say 10,000 let's also move it over on the Z let's set that to 4,980 that should make sure it begins in about the same place as our player now of course we can begin sketching out our level there are a few things we can do to make that easier for us the first one is getting the right view in the scene view notice how we have different axes up here we can actually click on those to shift A View to that axis so let's click on the Y we currently in perspective view if we click on the center Cube we can switch to isometric this flattens our en High scene and allows us to set up our level in kind of a 2d view you can also go up here and disable stuff like Skybox fog and flares you can Tuggle all of those on and off by simply clicking the environment here so I'm going to Tuggle those off the grid I'm actually going to leave in here but if you go on the gizmos you can disable that as well we can also take our ground go up to layer hit add layer and we can add a new layer called something like ground or environment we can then take our ground plane and assign that layer now if we go up to the layers toggle we can hit the lock next to the en environment this now means that if we deselect our ground we can't actually select it within our scene we can still select it in the hierarchy of course but it makes it so much easier to select the objects we want in our scene so now we can delete our two obstacles here take the first one and kind of move it forward a bit if we drag on the green square here it allows us to move it only in the x and z position you can of course go ahead and move these in freehand but I prefer doing things on a grid we can go edit snap settings to configure how objects snap to the grid I'm going to put two on the X two on the Y and two on the Z and just leave scale and rotation as is we can just close this now and that means that if we now move this object and hold down control it's going to snap to every two units all right so let's begin with this in the center and then press contrl D or command D if you're on the Mac to duplicate the object and move it over while holding down control and you can just repeat this process to create an interesting level all right so you can see I've created a tiny bit of gameplay elements here of course I did this very quickly and I'm not always the most creative when it comes to level design but you get just how easy it is to place obstacles into our scene you should of course pump this up with a bunch of different kind of objects you can put collectible coins in here obstacles that move back and forth stuff to jump over or go beneath there's plenty of opportunity and the best thing about it is just how easily we can play test it let's try and hit play and see how difficult this level is the first thing that I'm noticing is that my controls feel really really slow now that's not really a problem with the level that's more a problem problem with our movement script so let's see what we can do to edit that let's select our player and double click on our player movement now currently in order to move our player forward we're adding a force and I think that works fine but when moving to the right and to the left it feels very nonresponsive that's because when adding a force to an object over time it slowly builds up momentum and when we then change direction we have to wait for the object to build up enough Force to do so and this is where Force modes come in unity actually allows us to specify in which way we should add a force and we do that as a fourth parameter first we have the force on the X then we have the force on the Y then on the Z and finally we have the Force mode so let's put a comma here and let's input force mode dot we can go through and read about what the different forces do the standard one is force which adds a continuous Force to the rigid body using its mass the one that we want is velocity change this directly edits the velocity of the object and it completely ignores its mass so make sure to add this to both of the add Force statements let's now save and head back into unity and I know by experience that when using velocity change we need much molder numbers I think something around 100 should be fine so if we now hit play we can try that out it already feels much more responsive but I think it could be better one thing we can do to make the movement feel more Snappy is up the drag drag is basically air resistance so the higher the drag the more quickly our object is going to be stopped by air that also means that we need to amp up our forces in order to move at the same speed but it should make everything feel more responsive because the object is quicker to slow down so let's op the drag to something like one let's leave the same sideway Force let's actually put our forward Force up quite a bit let's try it out at 4,000 if we now hit play Everything feels so much better I think this is a good forward force and I think our controls feel really fluent by the way a cool shortcut is that you can play the game by hitting control P or command P if you're on the Mac so the level already feels pretty fun however it's not too hard to see that this particular part is a bit too difficult so let's just go in here and maybe add a tiny bit more distance between the first obstacle and the next one and we'll do the same thing with these let's try it out again much better the final thing that I wanted to add in this video is fog currently we can see all the objects no matter how far away they are that's not too pretty and it also makes the game feel a lot less interesting the neat thing about this game is that it feels like the obstacles are coming out of nothing and you never know what to expect well we know but the player shouldn't so let's go on do window and select lighting we can then take our lighting panel and dark it over here by the inspector and maybe give it a bit more space there are a bunch of settings here to play around with stuff like the intens of our ambient light how to calculate shadows and Reflections and finally we have the fog let's go ahead and enable that let's also expand it this allows us to set a color of our fog you can choose pretty much any color you'd like and definitely get interesting with this but I'm just going to go ahead and use the Color Picker to get the color of our background that makes it feel like everything is splending in Towards the Sky we then up the density a bit I'm going to set it to something like 02 so now if we maximize our game view by hitting shift space press play we can see that our game actually starts to feel like a game the level is currently really short though so I definitely recommend creating something a bit larger and again you have most of the stuff in place here to create procedure levels don't be scared to experiment that was pretty much it for this video If you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe so you don't
