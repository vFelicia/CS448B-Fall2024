thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to this exclusive interview with the guy behind 31 games in 31 days he's called Victor AKA zein captain and he's just made his own Block featuring the 31 games so welcome to you Victor tell us how long have you been making games hello well uh I've been making games for uh about 6 years and I've been making most of them in game maker just small games in my spare time um and after well I at some point I wanted to move on from game maker and so I made some I started learning Flash and using action script and at some point I put uh flexel in there to use as a library um and I also took halfe class in Java programming but I've never actually made any games in that uh since I decided to move back to game maker after trying out Java cool so you you've been making games for quite some time um this project you've started it's it's really interesting to me the nature of it could you tell us more on how you came up with the concept like the reasoning behind um the idea well half a year ago I tried out uh how fast I could make games in game maker and I tried doing these uh games which I called 15 minutes project uh where I made a few games something like uh seven games and so I realized that it was actually possible for me to make one of these very quick games uh I could actually make one of those every single day and so because I wanted the practice and because I wanted uh to try out if I liked making games for a long time so at the end of September I kind of just decided out of nowhere that now was the time uh for me to try making games for a full month and see if I could actually finish this uh idea of mine turns out you could um but maybe you could elaborate on your experience with game maker um as a tool like the goods and the bads did you ever meet any limitations throughout when making these games well the main good thing about game maker is how easy it is to use and how quick it is to use which was of course perfect for this project because I could make games in a very short time and still have quite a bit of functionality in them the uh bad things about game maker are mainly its limitations in that it is very bad at making 3D games for example so if I wanted to make a 3D game I would probably start learning Unity but for this purpose and for most 2D games I think uh it is uh game maker is quite enough definitely agree with you um to those of you out there who thinks that Unity can be quite the challenge game maker is a great free tool unless you want to publish to extreme platforms like mobile and and so on one thing that fascinates me is how you just how you're just able to sit down and so yourself force yourself actually to come up with some kind of idea some kind of mechanic that just works and um maybe you could give me some inside on how what do you think when you sit down to make this game how do you brainstorm the mechanics and from there start building the game the way I do it is that I make sure that I have some time where I won't get interrupted and where I have time to be alone and I sit down and I start thinking sometimes I put on some music um which helps uh often but I sit down and then I I start thinking about these very uh AB abstract things like um abstract things interacting with each other like uh big buildings growing out of walls and big circles hitting them and I just let my brain uh go wild with everything that I can think of and then at some point if I think of something that I think is interesting I kind of try to condense that into something that that I could make in game maker uh into a mechanic uh that could work then when I have that mechanic I I can pretty quickly tell from experience if it will be any fun and if I will actually be able to make it if it's uh if it doesn't meet these two criteria I scrap it immediately and I try to think of something new but when I then when when I have something that has passed these two uh main criteria I then start thinking about uh a goal for this mechanic because often I'll have uh thought of something like like an interesting way to move around um but then I I because I want to make games and not just uh funny ways of moving around I I then try to think of a goal for this and uh something that that you can do like uh collect something or avoid something and those goals are often very simple because uh well because I have to make something quick and that's why many of the these games are score based or have very quick levels with with a very simple goal right uh I mean your brainstorming method seems really effective um it must be um since you've completed this project but something I I often see when when people start making games is that they start out by saying that it should accomplish this it should include this and have this and that and and what you really need to to um do is is just let your brain go wild as you said just come up with something that you know you can create and then later try to accomplish goals with it so not build up too many criteria in your head which the game has to fulfill because then you can just brainstorm and brainstorm and you will never really reach that goal and and also it's not about what the first prototype looks like but because that's always going to suck um but but it's really about taking something that that you think could be good and then just building on top of it and building and building until it finally looks polished um because you can't expect it to be um with the first prototype so what really got me into making games what was the idea of being able to combine Hobbies I've always been this hobby person and I could suddenly make music design and program and all of this in in and combine it into one piece but uh what what do you find most interesting about the process of making these smaller games is it problem solving coming up with mechanics um shoot right now the most interesting uh thing about making games for me is uh coming up with mechanics um because when I have made a mechanic and I've implemented it for the first time um when I then uh boot up the game for the first time and see how it actually uh works out I really understand a word that a lot of game developers use which is exploring that they feel that they're exploring a mechanic uh I really understand this the first time I boot it up because it's like I'm exploring this whole new uh well world that I've uh just created in a way so what's your next big project are we going to see 100 games in 100 days or or do you have something more specific that you can tell us about um what what's what's the next big thing um from Mr zein Captain well actually I I have something very uh different in mind I am still going to work in game maker and make something 2D but my next project uh will the the most important uh thing for me right now is that I'll be able to make something where I focus on the details and go in into more depth uh with the project and uh more specifically the idea I'm working with right now is kind of a 2d version of Proteus um with a more heavy focus on interaction if that makes any kind of sense it does definitely but uh it looks like we are running out of time so basically if you want to play Mr Captain's games uh please W visit his website links on the screen and in the description or his Twitter again screen description and uh thank you for participating and thank you for having me enjoy the games everyone
