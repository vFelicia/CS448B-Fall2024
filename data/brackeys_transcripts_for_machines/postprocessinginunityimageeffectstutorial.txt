in this video we'll go through all the different image effects in the new postprocessing stack we'll talk about what they do and how we can use them this video is also the first sponsored video on this channel however today's sponsor is actually something that I personally use and love it's called Skillshare it's an online learning community and it's a place where you can go to learn all sorts of creative skills I've been using it to them more about graphics programming actually they found this really cool course on making generative art it's really indepth and the author is a super funny guy so a lot of you guys have been asking me to do procedurally generated stuff well go check that out skill chair has over 15,000 classes for you to choose from and that's especially love cool design stuff like illustrated tips and app design using sketch 3 Premium Membership begins around $10 a month for unlimited access but I have a link for you in the description where you can get two months for free I like free stuff too alright enough about Skillshare let's get into it so first off we want to import the post processing stack I imagine this will be integrated into the editor very soon but for now logistical window asset store let's search for post processing and let's select the post processing stack I'll also have a link to this in the description it's now hit import when this window pops up we'll hit import again and you should now see that a folder called post processing has appeared in your project panel now in order to get this working inside of our game we have to select our main camera we're gonna add a new component and the component we want to add is the post processing behavior we need this on every camera that we want to apply post processing effects to and this takes in a post processing profile a profile is basically just a data pic where we can adjust our effects so we'll go into the project panel right click create I will select post processing profile I'm just gonna call this one CC for color correction and you can see that when we select this object we have all of these different effects available to us remember to also select the camera and drag in the profile you just created now we're actually ready to apply effects however there are a few settings on our camera that I recommend you said if you want to get the most quality out of your game the first one is the rendering path we can change this from forward to deferred this will give us a lot more lining fidelity but it is also harder on the hardware and not supported on some platforms whenever we select deferred here we also have to disable modes antialiasing we'll have a look at antialiasing in just a second on top of this we'll also go under edit project settings quality and in here make sure to disable antialiasing we'll add this through an image effect in just a second and finally we can go to a camera and select allow HDR HDR stands for high dynamic range and it's a way of packing more color data into your image this gives us greater control over the look of the scene when we start applying image effects and helps us avoid clipping where you lose color information in very bright or dark spots now that all of our camera settings are correct we can go to a cc object and start messing around with the image effects let's begin at the very top here with antialiasing antialiasing is the process of reducing jagged edges it adds interpolation to try and smooth out stairstep like lines let's enable it and you can see immediately what this does to our edges it really helps smooth them out now here we actually have the ability to choose between two methods the fast approximate with the temporal fast approximate is faster but a bit lower quality and temporal is of course the opposite higher quality but also more expensive I find that a very rarely used to timbrel antialiasing but it is here and offers a lot more settings however you need 5.6 I have found that it sometimes causes some weird behavior normally you just have to kind of enable it rename it maybe change some settings until it drops right well now I'll be sticking to the fast approximate and in here you also have the ability to choose between quality and performance so next is ambient occlusion ambient occlusion dark and serious were two surfaces intersect to create shadows and places where light would have a hard time escaping from this can be done very precisely by breaking the lighting into a light map on the flight with postprocessing using a technique called SSAO screen space ambient occlusion let's enable it and you can see the shadows being applied here to the places where two surfaces meet now this is a good one to adjust a bit the intensity is pretty selfexplanatory I like to keep this pretty high when I'm setting all the other settings just to make everything visible then we have the radius this is how close we want the shadows to be so if we decrease this we can see that we are kind of shrinking in the shadows and we can of course also increase them for this game here I'm gonna set them to something like point one two maybe I think that looks alright actually they might bump it up to point two then we have the sample count this is the number of ambient occlusion samples for each pixel on the screen and determines the smoothness of the rendering I find the medium often works pretty well you can see the difference too high here but since we assumed in so far I actually think I'm gonna increase hi in this case gets rid of some of that weird banding we can also disable down sampling down sampling we'll have the resolution of the effect in order to save on performance what I find you can just gain so much visual fidelity by disabling it you will however have a big cost on performance here so it's always a matter of what you can do for your King and the platform you're targeting now I almost never use the next settings here so I'm just gonna bump down the intensity here and we can move on next up a screen space reflection this effect computes reflections based on the surface roughness it cannot make materials feel more lifelike because they actually reflect the surrounding environment so in a current scene here we don't really have any objects that would be influenced by screen space reflection if we enable it you can see it doesn't make too much of a difference let's just for fun take our ground here and add some kind of reflective material to it I've just gone ahead and created a material here with a fairly high metallic value and a fairly high smoothness and you can see now that our ground is indeed creating reflections from the objects in our scene if we go and select our color correction object and go into the screen space reflection tab you can see there's a lot of settings here here's how it looks without you can definitely play around with a lot of these most of the time you'll probably want physicallybased reflection you can set the quality between high and low I find that lowest often good enough you also have the max distance until you cannot see reflections anymore most of the time the duration count is fine as is same thing with the step size and width modifier here you can decide how much you want to blur out different flexions you can choose whether or not you want to reflect back faces I would leave this off in cases where you use mostly horizontal surfaces but enable it if you have a lot of vertical reflections the reflection multiply allows us to boost the reflections the distance at which the reflection should start fading and then we have the fernell fade you can see these two sliders adjust how the reflections look the further we get away from the surface then we have depth of field this effect simulates the properties of a real camera lens meaning that it applies focus only to objects with a certain distance from the camera the rest of the image is blurred and bright spots get highlighted with circular artifacts which we refer to as bouquet let's enable that and in our case we can't actually see this effect yet that's because we have to adjust some settings here now a lot of people really get confused about what these terms mean at least if you're not really into photography the focus distance is fairly Suffolk's territory this is the distant from the camera where we put our focus point over the aperture and focal lengths are bit more technical our focal length and camera terms represents the distance between our lens and the film a creative focal length means more blurring this is also why you get more blur when you zoom in with the camera than when zoomed out so if we go ahead and bump this up to something like 70 we can't actually see too much growing yet that's because there's another value that has effect on how much we blur that's the aperture or often referred to as fstop this is effectively how much we open our lens in order to let light in the lower the value the wider we open the lens and the wider we open the lens the more blurry we get so if we just decrease this we can see that we should start blurring things in our scene of course we don't want to go overboard with this but we can easily put it at around say 1 we can then take our focus distance and decrease it to place it around our barrel and wheels so I think that looks pretty decent if we want this kind of macro shot we could also go out and increase the fstop if we want to see more of the background or decrease the focal length I think these settings look pretty fine for now then we have motion blur motion blur well blur its motion in real life a camera takes in light over small periods of time if the camera moves during these periods the image gets stretched out creating motion blur I think it's pretty much a musthave effect for fastmoving games so to test out our motion blur I've gone ahead and added an FPS control the Torah's scene this way we can move around and see the motion blur in action if we then enable motion blur under our color correction it should actually already be working just fine if I go ahead and hit play we can see that when I move around the image indeed gets blurred and it makes everything look much smoother especially if you turn it off in comparison the two main slides to worry about here is the shutter angle in the sample count the higher the shutter angle the more the motion blur I'm just gonna put this to something like 300 the higher the Sam account the more smooth the motion blur gets this will also have an impact on performance so I think leaving it at 10 is fine for most cases you can also use the multiple frame blending this is mostly used for artistic purposes if you want to get the drunk effect let me go and turn it up to one here so you can see what that looks like we also have eye adaption this effect adjust the exposure of the image as the game is running creating the illusion of an eye adjusting itself to a lighting environment at the time of making this video the iadapt ation documentation is pretty sparse don't want to just assume what the different parameters mean for me to work fine so far without having to tweak anything I'll have a link to the documentation in the description as well now we have an effect that can really help make your game pop which is also why it's so overused it's called bloom bloom makes light from a bright source bleed into surrounding objects in other words it allows us to add glow to bright spots let's enable it and you can see immediately that it really helps spring a fire to life the effect gives us a few settings the first one is the intensity and this is just the brightness on the stuff that we want to bloom I think a value of 0.5 is pretty okay here then we have the threshold this defines how bright a pixel should be in order to be registered by the effect so if we set this to a very low number you can see that we bloom pretty much the entire scene and if we increase it only the brightest of bright spots will get bloomed I think in our case a value of around 1.4 is going to be cried all right the soft needs how it blends from things under the threshold to things over the threshold you can see what that does here I normally just leave that at 0.5 we didn't have the radius this is how much we want to go ahead and blur the lighting from the original pixels kind of the size of the effect be careful not to overdo this one sometimes when you have a moving camera you can get some really weird flickering if you check the anti flicker it will help prevent that finally you can also apply a dirt texture on top of the camera the postprocessing stack comes with a few ones that you can try out I normally don't use these too much the next one is really important it's color grading color grading is without a doubt the largest of the effects because it allows us to control the overall look of our image in terms of exposure color and contrast let's check it and you can see immediately that it really flattens out our image that's because it's currently using the tone mapper now I want to be explicit about this you only want to use the tone mapper meaning having this set to neutral or filmic if you're using HDR if you have HDR unchecked you should go ahead and select none the neutral tone map is going to layout your colors and brightness values so that they look really flat this allows you to apply very hard color correction on top of that it just makes sure that we don't loose a lot of color data so that we can pretty much go in any direction with the image that we want then go ahead and adjust some of the settings for the tone mapper here but I'm actually pretty satisfied with this some instead going to go down and apply some color correction first up we have the exposure this is the overall brightness of the scene then we have stuff like temperature 10 hue shift saturation contrast I want to apply a bit of contrast here probably also bump up the exposure a bit I think I'm gonna leave the temperature and maybe tend it slightly magenta we can also shift the hue here which gives a pretty dramatic change and the saturation I think I'm pretty much just gonna leave as is we then have the channel mixer here which allows you to change properties for the different colors and you can also use the trackball switch I like to do I'm gonna give it a bit of red in the high end here some more green in the mid and some blue in the darks if you rightclick one of these it's going to reset it we also have a curves adjustment here if you want to go in here you can add keys in order to bump up say the brightness here and maybe decrease it a bit on the low end we can go in and select another channel say the red channel here add a key here and you can change that around as well so it's really easy to do color adjustments in here I'm satisfied with the look of this you can see what it looks like before and after instead of doing the color grading in the engine itself you can also use the use a lot lot stands for lookup texture it's an optimized way of performing color grading because you grade your image beforehand in another program such as Photoshop and then export the color data into a lot that is then read by unity if that's something you want to use you put in the texture here and you can also adjust the blending factor here but we'll just be using the building color grading then we have some of the more niche artistic effects the first one is chromatic aberration this filter stimulates chromatic distortions at the edges of the screen chromatic aberration is often seen in lower quality camera lenses if we enable this and bump up the intensity we can immediately see the effects actually they think it's pretty cool to have in here but this is way too much let's leave it at around 0.15 you can also set a spectral texture which is going to shift the hue of the chromatic aberration by default it generates one for you but there also some available under textures spectral lots and we can just try out one of the other ones here say the blue red we bump up the intensity now you can see that looks a bit different I actually like this one even better but then of grain this affects some the adds a layer of grain to simulate filmic noise let's enable that I don't think this particularly suits our scene here but we have an intensity slider we have the size of the grains and how much they should be affected by the luminance of our scene you can also choose whether or not you want them to have color I'm just gonna disable this 4rc we have a vignette a vignette can be used to darken the edges and corners of an image this is often visible when lenses assumed in and can be used to great dramatic effect if we enable this we can see that by the default the effect is pretty strong I definitely like this far as seen because it helps draw attention to whatever is in the center but I think we should decrease it a little bit we're gonna just stuff like the center point the color of the vignette the smoothness the roundness which is easier to see if we go ahead and bump up the intensity and you can choose whether or not you want this to be rounded that means should it be completely circular or should it be kind of adjusted to fit the aspect ratio of our screen and see that on and off here you can also change the mode from classic to masked and this allows you to input your own black and white texture to use as the vignette this can be cool if you want to do stuff like dirt or blood on your screen I'm just gonna go with classic and I want to bump down the smoothness a tiny bit but also increase the intensity so I like that a lot finally we have dithering dithering is the process of reducing banding in gradient areas by introducing some controlled noise to the image we won't be using this effect here but here's an example of an image with and without diddling so that concludes all of the different image effects that you can apply to your game if we go ahead and hit play now we can see the effects of these as the game is running and if we select our main camera we can see what it looks like with and without so really a huge bump up in quality just by adjusting a few knots that's pretty much it for
