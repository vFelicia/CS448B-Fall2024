getting around unity is normally fairly easy however I found that knowing just a few shortcuts can really speed up development and open up for some handy features that aren't part of the UI so here are all the unity shortcuts that you need to know but first this video is sponsored by a skill share skill share is an online learning community with more than 19 thousand quality classes on design game development tech and more if for example you want to learn how to use game maker there's this awesome course on creating an RPG in game maker studio 2 throughout the course you'll be implementing stuff like tile sets a player and enemy and loot a premium skill share membership gives you unlimited access to all classes for less than $10 a month so to get started simply click the link in the description and the first 500 people will receive their first two months phone in $0.99 all right back to the video let's begin by quickly getting scene navigation out of the way these are old left mouse to orbit old mill mouse to drag an old right mouse or scroll to assume I realize most of you probably know that already but it has to be sent you can also press f to focus on an object which is crazy useful and if the object is moving you can press F twice to follow it around now moving on to tools you can of course switch between the different transformation tools using shortcuts these are arranged neatly at the top of the keyboard and go q for hand tool W for move if rotate and R for scale you can access the rect tool using T and the new unified manipulation tool using Y personally I don't really use this tool as I've just gotten so used to switching between move rotate and scale myself by holding down ctrl together with these tools you can snap to the grid and holding down the V key you will snap to vertices and a lot of people don't know this but you can actually use Z and X to toggle between pivot modes and local versus world space so that's pretty cool in terms of playing the game you can press control P to toggle in and out of play mode and use control shift P to pause at any point also remember whenever we use ctrl on Windows that is command on a Mac if you want to you can also use ctrl alt P to go forward frame by frame if you want to play our game as a standalone we can press control shift B to bring up the build or just control be to quickly build and run the game as for editing objects you can use the usual commands for copypaste and cut and on top of that you can use control D to duplicate and the Delete key to remove to search for a particular object use ctrl F inside the window you want to search in and if you just want to select all objects in the scene simply press ctrl a for all now all of that isn't very exciting but you can also create game objects using shortcuts to create an empty game object we use ctrl shift n + alt shift then to do the same but as a child of the selected game object we can also align an object with our current view using ctrl shift F is this all the time when trying to find nice camera angles simply find a good angle in the scene view select the camera and align with view it's awesome finally if you make a mistake during development you can always undo using ctrl Z and this is actually the only command that I know of that is different for mac and windows but to redo we use ctrl Y on Windows and command shift Z on Mac don't ask me why you can also use keyboard shortcuts to change the editor you can actually open editor windows by pressing ctrl + the corresponding number key to see a list of all the shortcuts simply go to the window tab and they should appear and maybe more importantly you can also maximize or minimize windows by whoring over a window and hitting shift space I use this all the time for focusing on a particular part of the editor and finally I just want to mention that we can of course press ctrl n to create a new scene ctrl s to save the current scene and ctrl shift s to save as and that pretty much concludes the list of keyboard shortcuts that I use when making games in unity hope you remember them I've created this unity shortcuts cheat sheet which you can download for free from our patreon page this of course a link for that in the description also make sure to check out Skillshare simply click the link in the description to get started on that thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video thanks of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in April and a special thanks to Diego guy Kiva Theo infinity PPR and extended player psychic mummy Derrick Eames Kirk Clinton fan skier del / Ned Tommy Hwang Frizzle Murphy Daniel Sullivan cheetah 3d thanks to long PRN Glade Schneider tiny link J delay Superman the great John Burkhart Dennis Sullivan Jason the Tito Electric hits key points cat Matthew Knight James P Gregory Pierce James Rogers Nokia Vaisakhi Robert bond Levitt weed Tim of holder Park Jimin Rob Ferran adri√† nastier and Erasmus you guys Rock
