hello everyone just want to let you know that I will be livestreaming in just a second over at twitch so go to twitch.tv slash Blackie's to check it out here's what we're going to be making today it's basically a flappy bird replica or basically just like any other of these slingshot games where we have some unity spring physics working for us and some collision detection and we also replenish our cannonballs here when we run out it's going to restart the level here so there's plenty of opportunity here to expand upon the idea and do something with it yourself and it's always just really really fun to mess around with a unity building physics system so a lot of opportunity here and I really hope that you will join us again at twitch.tv slash blackies it will of course also be live afterwards on youtube and so at the end we'll do a short Q&A so lots of good stuff and I'm looking forward to seeing you there
