version control is useful for so many reasons I use it mostly for singing projects between computers for collaborating on projects and for keeping backups I can easily revert back to in this video we'll have a look at how we can set up github and use it with unity I'm going to come to version control there's a lot of terminology being thrown around but here's the basic breakdown kit it's an opensource version control system github it's a website that makes it easy to host and control projects using git when you sign up on github you can create a repository a repository is a place where you can store your project after creating a repository or repo people can clone it to their computers that means creating a local version of the project that's sitting on your computer you can then make changes to the project and commit these changes to the repository on github and everyone will get notified about the change in order to easily commit changes and pull other people's changes people either use a commandline interface or a desktop client this is a touchy subject for many but for the sake of simplicity we'll be using github own client github desktop finally there are few things to think about when using get hub with unity specifically we'll get into those later alright enough with that let's get started so first we want to go to github calm here we're going to create an account already have one so I'm just going to log in we then want to hit start a project and here we can create our repository first we'll need a name I'm just going to call this example game getup doesn't allow spaces in the repository name then we can input a small description and then you can choose whether or not you want the repository to be visible to the public now a free github account doesn't allow you to select private here currently you can upgrade for seven dollars a month but personally I haven't found a reason to do this yet I like the idea of the software I'm working on to be public we can then choose to initialize this repository with a readme we'll go ahead and check that and we'll see what this means in a second we can also choose to add a git ignore file a git ignore is basically just a text file that allows you to specify some files and folders that you don't want to include in your version control here's an example of a git ignore in here we ignore all files ending in calm dark class the DLL and so on I always recommend including a git ignore and that's actually a default one setup for unity this will make sure to ignore all the temporary files that unity creates finally you can choose to add a license but we'll just leave that blank we can then hit create repository and here's the repository for our example game you can see we currently only have two files we have the gate ignore file and we have the readme the readme is a markdown file which allows us to easily add text to it and by default it's displayed on your opening page here we can actually click on the readme and edit it inside of the browser so I'll just go ahead and add another line here if we then scroll to the bottom you can see that we can now commit this change by default it's just going to say update readme which is fine for me and we don't need much description on this one let's just hit commit Changes and now if you go back to our root folder we can see it's changed we also see that it's now updated here and says two commits if we click on this we can see the history of the project currently there is only two versions the initial one with the default readme and the one we just made with the updated one you can always click on a commit in order to see what's changed so now we're ready to clone our project but to do that we'll need to install a git client if you go to desktop github comm github has their own client to use and this client recently got remade and so the new version is in beta however it seems a lot better than the old one and I haven't had a single issue yet but in case something doesn't work for you you can always scroll to the bottom here to download the old version we'll just hit download for Windows and yes there is a Mac version as well well then click on the Installer hit run and you should now see a github icon on your desktop let's double click on it and the first time you open it it will ask you to sign in as well as put in the name and an email that you want to be associated with your commits I recommend using the same email add to your github account you can always edit this by going to file options here you can sign in to a github account I'm going to sign in here now you can also go and do get to fill out your name and mail let's say that and now we have three options we can create a new repository locally we can clone an existing one from github or you can add a local repository that you might have lying around we'll hit clone repository and here we need a URL to get that we'll simply go into our repository a clone or download and copy this URL I'm just going to hit copy to clipboard and paste it in we can then choose a path for our project I'm going to put mine inside of my projects folder let's then hit clone and you should now see that if you open up your folder your repository will be there and inside it is our kid ignore and I read me now we can go ahead and add and edit all files we want inside of this folder let's try putting a unity project in there so open up unity that's it new I'm going to call it example game project at the location I'll choose our repository that's called example game that's a create project so it's an empty scene let's just save that as main and if we now go to our github client we see all the different files that were added to our repo but before we commit these we want to set up a few things in unity we want to go edit project settings editor and here we want to make sure that under version control we've selected visible meta files for each asset inside of your project panel unity will create a meta file associated with that object the meta file stores information such as what settings we have on that object and wedge used in our project we want to make sure that these are visible so they will get picked up by our version control will also go into asset serialization and set that to force text that will make a lot of the files created by unity a lot more readable we now go to our client and before we couldn't preview this file but now we can see all of the different values that make it up that's because if the force text attribute we now want to commit this project let's make sure that all of the files are selected and in the summary we'll just right add empty project and before we commit to master that's one more thing we want to fix you can see how it says 164 change files here a lot of files are actually meta files and you might think what why didn't I get ignored get rid of these well if you ask me that's according to a mistake in the kid ignore file that github sets up for unity the reason why is if we go into our project and open up our gate ignore we can see all the files that it tells us to exclude however it does this based on the impression that the root of our project will also be the root of the repository and we put our project in a subfolder which i think is just better practice anyways so to fix that we can go in and delete all the slashes in the beginning of the folders here and if we save that and go into our client we can see the number of files now have changed to 19 and you can also see the changes we just made to our gate ignore I'll make sure to link you to a better get ignore for unity in the description let's then hit commit to master and wallah we can now go into the history tab to see a new commit but this commit it's only sitting on our computer let's make sure to push it to the server let's click the push origin button and there we go if we now visit a repository in the browser we can see our project has been added and now we can go on creating our game and when you've made some changes simply go back into the client and add a new commit and of course make sure to push it if you make changes to a project on another computer it will prompt you to pull those guess what you do that using the same button here let's pretty much it for this video
