analytics can play a huge part of making a game successful because it's just so hard to know from the beginning how people are going to experience different parts of your game so in this video we'll have a look at enabling Unity analytics and how you can use stuff like custom events funnels and remote settings to probably monitor your game and make changes after it goes live on the screen now you should see all the things that we're going to cover in this video feel free to skip to any one of them also there's a lot of terminology when it comes to analytics I'll have a link to a glossary in the description alright let's get started let's begin by enabling Unity analytics this will open up the services window here we can go under analytics and let's press the toggle here to enable it we then click continue and here we need to press play in the editor to validate the connection with analytics servers after it says analytics enabled we can then stop playing and Congrats we've actually now just set up Unity analytics now it says here it might take unity some hours to publish the data but we can go to the dashboard right away and here is the analytics dashboard as you can see it currently says pending data processing and of course we don't want to wait for this so inspired by all the great TV cooks I've gone it and cheated a little bit if you go to the top and click operate you can see all of your cloud service enabled projects here you will also see a demo project if we click this we can essentially see what our project is going to look like under the overview tab we can see stuff like our active players the amount of sessions this week use the retention as well as generated revenue and we can also split this up into nice graphs so we can see a development over time if you want to explore even more data we can go into the data Explorer and here we can see a breakdown of a whole bunch of events we know so split our data into multiple segments as you can see here there are a bunch of pre generated segments some of these are locationbased some of them are based on demographics or target platforms and we can actually add segments ourselves we'll have a look at that later if we go into live stream we can see how our game is doing in real time and we can actually see our active users plotted on a map so this is really cool now if we go back to our game that's of course no data available yet but as soon as it finished processing it should actually already track active players sessions retention and all that however this of course a bunch of things that you might want to track which is specific to your game now inside of unity I've created this test scene called button in here I have a canvas with a UI button and the button says press me now let's imagine that I wanted to track people pressing on this button to do that I would go to the button and add a new component I would search for analytics and select the analytics tracker now here I could create a new event name in my case that would be button press and we've now just defined a custom event we then choose how to trigger this event you can trigger it when starting a level when enabling or disabling an object or we could choose external this means that you can trigger the event from other scripts in our case we want to trigger it whenever you press the button so I'm going to add an on click event on our button I'm gonna drag in our analytics tracker script I'm then gonna go under function go into the analytics tracker and click on trigger event now every time we click this button it will notify our analytics tracker which will trigger a button press event and we can actually see this happening in real time if we open up our dashboard and go under a live stream we'd already see that we have one user locking and one new user if we scroll down to the bottom here we can see our top custom events if we then go into unity and hit play we can try clicking on the button a few times I'm just gonna click it three times and if we now go back to our dashboard and we might need to wait a bit for it to update we can hopefully see that we have a button press event and that it has occurred three times now if for some reason unity is still setting up your analytics and this isn't triggering we can always see it working if we go under our services and here on the D validator we can see our three button presses as well as an exact time for triggering the event now that's pretty cool but that's actually much more we can do with custom events if I open up my next test scene here you can see that I have two buttons a red one and a green one let's say we wanted to make a game where we keep track of how many people have pressed the red button versus the green one in this case we could of course go ahead and create two separate events but both events would be a button press so a better way to do this would be using parameters if we go onto our canvas here and select our red button I'm going to switch to the inspector here we can see that I have an analytics tracker here with the button press and the triggers set to external but we can also add a parameter you can have parameters specific to different game objects or could have static parameters which are simply a single value in our case the name of our parameter should be color and the value of a parameter should be red now we can do the same thing for a green button here we add a parameter we change the parameter to static set the name to color and the value to green now we can switch into our services and hit clear on our validator when then hit play and we try pressing the red button say twice and the green button once and we should see our custom events here update to 600 but we can't see parameters in live view instead we'll have to go into the data Explorer here we could add a custom event and here we would input the custom event of button press for the segment we could use all current users and as the parameter we could then input color but as you can see we'll have to wait for this to update so for now we can just check that everything is working in our validator here we can see that indeed we have three button presses two of them with a color red and one of them with the color green awesome and talk about analytics and games one of the most important things is trying to figure out where and why your player is having a tough time and a good way to measure this is using funnels funnels allow us to take custom events and use them to track how a player is progressing through the game serve a simple scene with a button for loading the next level and as you can see I have three different levels each with a button and then the last one is just a blank finished screen when pressing the button I'm calling two different things on a level loader object first of all I'm triggering an event on analytics tracker and the event name of course corresponds to our given level so this is level one for level two this says level two and of course for level three it says level three then I call a very simple method on the level loader all this is doing is just loading the next scene so if we were to try and hit play now and click on load next level a few times until we get to the finished level we can see that it calls our different events so first off we finished level one we then finished level two and finally we finish level three and we can see this under our custom events as well don't worry about the numbers here I've been trying this out a few times so now what this allows us to do is go up to our funnel analyser and add a new funnel using these events we could name this final level progression as the description we could say how many levels does the player complete and then we can add different steps so the first step here would be level 1 and second step would be level 2 and the final final step would be level 3 we will then save this hit ok and now we've created our first funnel as always with analytics we have to wait a bit until this works but if we look under the demo app and go to the funnel analyser we can see that it's set up one for us this works in the exact same way it has three levels and it shows the number of people who have completed each stage so you can see for this game there's a pretty big fall up from level 2 to level 3 so it would probably be a good idea to know if the difficulty here bit now previously we talked about how you can filter by different segments we do the same thing here let's try and filter by say platform and here we can see there's a total dropoff from level 2 to level 3 or for iOS users so maybe there's something going on there that should be fixed we can also add custom segments if you go to our own analytics going to the segment builder we can see a list of all the different segments added by default you can always hit edit if you want to change something about them or you can add a new segment say we wanted to focus on users who are playing a lot we could create a segment called hardcore fans and the description would be users playing a lot then that's the event we could say that the number of sessions a user had in the last week is and then we would say at least 10 it's only the really hardcore users to create this segment we simply hit create and as always we'll have to wait a bit for the data to update now the final thing that I want to show you is not so much an analytics tool as it's a really great patch tool I'm of course talking about remote settings now remote settings allow you to change values in your game after deploying this is really great to build into your game because after deploying your analytics might show that your game is too hard well if you created a remote setting for difficulty you could simply go in here and change it right away to start using remote settings we first have to change our configuration to development this will allow us to use remote settings in the editor and all bills set as development builds we then go into unity and is of course a simple test scene for remote settings all we have is text element on an empty canvas and it currently just says remote setting now we need to download a very small package from the unity asset store let's go to the asset store and search for remote settings let's navigate to unity analytics remote settings and hit download and import of course have a link in the description that's it import once again let's now try and change the value of our text using a remote setting so that's it add component and let's search for remote settings here we can add a new parameter we want to change our textile reference our text object under the field here I'm gonna go into our text component and I'm gonna change the text variable and now we need to specify a remote setting key now we haven't created this yet so let's go into a browser let's create a new key let's call this key game quality we can change the type here to say a string and the default value when we release the game is going to be bad we then add this you can see now it says edited here we change that by hitting sync let's say it sync once more and unity has now pushed this new value to the server now we can go into unity and most people go right to the setting key here and see there are currently no options that's because we actually have to go window unity analytics remote settings and here we have to insert our secret project key to get this key hit the lookup the key button and I'm gonna play this page but if I scroll down here you should see a field called project secret key simply copy this paste it into the field in the editor and hit next and you should now see all of the remote settings that you have configured on your dashboard we can see the key game quality of type string and that it currently has a value of pad let's now close this window and if we then go to our remote settings we can now select the game for the key if we hit play our text will automatically update to say bad we can then deploy our game to all kinds of systems and cross our fingers that our reviews are alright and when we then have a look at our analytics and find out that something is wrong here all we need to do is go to our dashboard edit our game quality and change it to good if we save that sync it and hit sync again we should see that the next time we play our game the result is good let's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it make sure it subscribes our dome it's a future one also unity pro allows you to do a lot more stuff with services so if you find yourself often using these I definitely recommend you check it out I'll ever link to it down in the description also let me know if there are any other services you want me to take a look at such as collaboration or ads on that thanks watching and I will see you in the next video thanks to all
