thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to video number eight in make a game a cool series on making a video game in unity today's subject is animation so we're going to do everything in the animation window and we'll go into that in just a sec but before then uh what you're seeing is today's featured project uh it's called moonwalk and it's made by Jacob games using these tutorials uh very well done uh if you want to get featured next week uh or have a chance to get featured you can uh write to me at brey's tweet on Twitter that's also on the screen or if you want to know more about moonwalk you can click the link uh or The annotation on the screen and and see the video and download the game it's it's very well done congratulations Jacob games Okay so let's dig right into today's subject uh first off let's go ahead and just sort some of these uh things out I think we have a little too many objects here so in the project pane so let's right click hit create folder and let's make a material folder so we're going to call this materials try again there so and select all of the materials using holding down control I'm pretty sure it's command on a Mac and then drag them onto the materials folder just to clear up some space cool what we're going to be animating today is the coin object we made in the last video basically we want this to rotate all the time um until it gets picked up and then it disappears you can see what we laid make made last um basically when we roll into it it just disappears uh in the next video we're going to do some particles that makes it look really cool whenever we pick it up but before we go ahead and animate it let's just select the ball and I really want to bump up the rotation speed I think it's simply too slow so I'm going to double that up to 200 hit play and see if this feels right yeah it's much more responsive now and and feels uh a lot more fun to control great well basically uh there are multiple ways to do animation in unity and the three ways I can think of right now are uh first of which through scripting so basically instead of animating it V ually you can go in and make a script that says for example if we wanted to rotate that it should rotate a little bit each frame on a certain axis though that's too complicated for what we're going to do now it's much easier to just make an animation so that's what we're going to do but you could also make an animation in another program and then use unity's new uh animation system called mechanim and that's using the animator here which is now grade out and uh that's also a more complicated thing you use that if you want to like animate characters and such but that's really difficult so we're not going to get into that if you want to know more about that you can watch our Survival Games tutorial series but basically what we're going to uh do today is use the basic animation component so we can just select the coin go to add component go to miscellaneous and hit animation not animator but animation click that and now we can add an animation clip but in order to do that we'll have to first make a clip so let's go to window animation or press control 6 to open it up and this is how it looks I really like to duck the animation panel down here by the project and then just drag it up quite a bit what we we can do now is we can make our game view sit by the side of our scene view by simply dragging it over and dark it by the side here so we can see changing in both the game View and the scene view okay great uh so basically what we're going to be doing now is we're going to be changing the transform of the objects and there is a new animation system coming in 4.3 this is version 4.2 so things might have changed just a bit since then but basically what we're going to need is the transform component here there's going to be a add um add animation thing uh button right here and what you need to add is the transform that's all we need to change is the transform great so what we're going to do is we're going to pre press this red button and that's going to allow us to create an animation call it whatever we want and we're going to call this um coin rotates like that and now you can see we can start changing the different variables here and the animation editor is really cool because you can change pretty much any value uh under the uh stored on the game object so that could be a we could change the trigger or we could change a light or we could change yeah we can change anything you can also go down to the CH uh Children of the object and and change some of them but again we're going to do the transform here and what we want is the rotation why and the reason why is because this uh Green Arrow here that's the Y you can also see it up here in the right hand of the scene View and uh and basically if we rotate around that use that as a pivot it will uh rotate around this way so if we go ahead and try to just change the Y over here on the right hand side in the inspector we can see it rotating the right way but uh yeah so basically this need to start at zero so let's make sure that the rotation y is at zero and then you can see this little thing this little uh key that you can press on the right hand side of the Y let's just press that and hit add key now that we have done this it's made what is called a key frame and that's basically saying that when we are at this point in time the rotation should be this variable and you can see now here that we can change a timeline here so we can scrub through time and you can see that this is 1 second I'm pretty sure that's 1 second we can go ahead and play it there um so right now we don't have any movement because it always States at zero but let's go ahead and just zoom out to two seconds here you can zoom using the alt and scroll wheel so zoom out to 2 seconds and let's now change the rotation wi to 360 so 360 and now we can scrub through this and see our coin rotating and once it gets to this point it will stop so basically we can hit play and see rotating and right now it's actually looping but let's just make sure that it's looping correctly by use going down here A W say default and selecting Loop so now select Loop and let's hit play and I think the rotation looked just fine um maybe we should just make it a little bit more slow so let's do something like 2.4 try again but this is really up to do I think this looks just perfect so let's go ahead and stop the recording here and now we just need to add it to the object so let's just drag in this Cor rotate wherever you saved it in the project and drag it onto the nonan animation clip here to add it and now when we make sure that it says play automatically and again that if we select it it says Loop not default we can go ahead and hit play Let's just bring up the game view here go ahead and hit play and we can see the coin rotating infinitely so this looks really awesome and that's Bas the that's the basics of using the animation window in unity I hope you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing what every project you're making thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one
