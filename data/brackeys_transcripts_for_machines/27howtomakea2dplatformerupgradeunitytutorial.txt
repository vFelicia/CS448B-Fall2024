thanks for tuning in at braies hello everyone and welcome to this video in the how to make a 2d platformer course today we're going to be making or at least beginning to make an upgrade menu for our game so we can upgrade different stats on our player and maybe even on our weapon too so that's going to be a lot of fun of course whenever we want to upgrade something we're also going to introduce some kind of uh currency to the game and uh yeah I think it's going to be a lot of fun to do so let's just jump right into it so you can see I'm here in unity as I normally am and uh the first thing that we kind of want to do is sketch out how we want the update menu to look uh because if we have a look at our player you can see that we already have this idea of stats and currently we only have a Max Health in here uh we also have uh on our platformer 2D uh or character 2D we have our max speed which is something that we could definitely uh make upgradeable uh and uh then of course under our player arm then pistol we have this weapon that has stuff like fire rate and by the way I want to change this to something like 20 and this to let's say 30 and uh we have both a fire rate and a damage parameter that we could make upgradeable here we could also make it uh possible for our player to switch weapons and that completely depends on what you want to do and uh yeah that's kind of the base of what we have going on here we uh I think we should also Implement some kind of Health Region uh over time and uh maybe we could even make that upgradeable too we could also do something like how much money you gain from enemies making that upgradeable is also a lot of fun so there are lot uh lots of different opportunities for us um to uh to implement here so the first thing that I want to do is I want to expand the UI overlay game object and I want to create a new empty here which is going to uh host our update menu there we go and this is something I think we should be able to bring up from time to time by simply pressing a button we could also do it so every time we complete a wave it will take us to the upgrade menu but I like to kind of um make it more Dynamic so you don't have to go through the update screen every time instead you just hit let's say you to upgrade and uh it will pause the game while you're in there this way it also serves as a pause menu uh if PE people don't use Escape that's up to them good uh so we have the update menu here and uh under this I want to go ahead and create a UI image and uh this is just going to be a flat image that will serve as our upgrade menu background um so for some reason it isn't snapping oh that's because we need to take our update menu hold down alt and click in the button right uh corner here uh to Anchor that to the entire screen and now we can do the same with this image hold on old and click there there we go so now it fills up the entire screen and we can go ahead and make this some kind of light blue color I think that could be pretty cool something like that would be uh a fine base uh to work off so um we're going to rename this to BG and we can make this complet uh completely uh solid or we could make it some what opaque so it just kind of fits on top of the game uh but I am going to go ahead and make this actually maybe we should just darken the game um no I'm going to make this completely uh solid and then make the this uh blue color I kind of like that so that's what we're going with cool and uh then we also want to right click go under UI and I want to add just a simple Graphics element in here to make it look a bit more interesting so I want to go under uh Sprites and find our as astronaut Sprite atas and drag the astronaut idle in here and hit set native size and then I want to kind of expand him and drag him over and we also need to give him an arm so let's just duplicate him dragging the arm now hit set native size and again let's expand this a bit size that up so it looks proportionate with our character here uh something like that looks pretty good just to have something in here that isn't just text and buttons kind of to spice up uh the menu so this makes it feel like we're actually upgrading our character which is something nice uh to feel um we can also of course if you want to be able to switch weapons in here or upgrade your weapon you can have a weapon graphic here and uh show the updates visually on that weapon how it changes um if you want to go uh fully all in with this system uh that's not something we're going to add now uh maybe in the future so we're going to have an astronaut here and under him we're going to have his uh arm there good and again this has no uh purpose other than being pretty uh then under the update menu let's go on UI and hit text and uh let's change the text here to uh update or no no no no upgrade have I been saying update this entire time this is not the update menu this is the up grade menu brain fart and of course that shouldn't be capitalized there we go all right so this is the upgrade menu and then we can go and find our Co font the little put steps I'm going to be using that again and we can size this up at Bunch so let's make that something like 64 drag it it up there anchor it to the top and while we at it the astronaut should be anchored to the left hand side the center of the left hand side and his arm should yeah that's fine at the center um and everything else looks good awesome so you can see how that looks and uh it should do just fine if we mess around with it good then we can take our text and make that completely white I think that looks pretty awesome then we can take uh and add on a shadow effect and let's make this red solid color and uh let's make the shadow go from three to 3 there and you can see that just gives it this cool retro look I'm going to take the astronaut here and maybe move him out just a tiny bit so he doesn't take up so much space on the uh screen and maybe move him down a bit too so something like that looks pretty good and uh the upgrade text we can drag that up a bit there we go and uh now we can actually fill in some text here so this is the uh upgrade uh title and we can just use that as a base so let's duplicate that and uh let's call this the um Health amount maybe and uh this is simply going to say that health and then a colon and then uh the current amount of Health that we have I'm just going to set this to 120 um and of course we're going to be changing this through script and then we can set maybe the size to something like 24 uh maybe a bit bigger something like 40 actually and uh the effect the shadow effect here I want to make that black instead and I want to make it a lot thinner so something like 2 to 2 that looks great so just to give it an outline but it doesn't need to be very clear actually maybe one to 1 um yeah I think that's even better uh so we're going to stick with that but I I like the white color so we're going to uh stick with that too uh so under the upgrade menu we can now create another Mt and uh this is simply going to act as a container for all of the different attributes just like the health amount uh that we want to display this way we can very easily add more we can even add them through code and it will make sure that they uh they are laid out correctly on the screen so uh this will simply acts kind of as a group of elements uh in the UI so uh I'm going to drag it out something like this I'm then going to rename this to attributes there we go then I'm going to take the health amount and drag it under attributes then under add component I'm going to go under layout and then choose vertical layout group and this is going to make sure that um all as as we add more attribute guy elements it's going to stretch them to fit uh this UI element vertically so if I add another one here you can see it makes them uh stack and that makes it very easy to add more attributes for now I'm going to stick with health amount and a um maybe speed amount and uh yeah that looks pretty good and we can change this here speed and then we want it to be um the default speed is 10 I believe again we're going to be changing this uh through code so it really doesn't matter then we're going to take the health and speed amount and make sure that it's uh centered on the left here and now you can see we can move them both by simply scaling the attributes so we can simply scale that over there and that already looks very fine and if we want them closer together well we can just scale down the attributes here uh or we can play around around with uh some of this functionality so uh we can choose the alignment upper left is going to be just fine we can choose whether or not we want them to ex be expanded on the height and width and we can also add a component on each of these which which is the layout element that will allow us to control different properties for width and height for that element that's not something we're going to be needing uh here but it's definitely something that you should pay attention to because it's it's actually really uh cool so play around with these things they can make your life a lot easier so as long as we only have these two I'm just going to scale them in like this and uh that's basically all we're going to have uh for the attributes uh for now uh so the next thing that we want to add are some buttons that will allow us to upgrade each of these attributes and for that I'm simply going to duplicate the attributes here and instead call these upgrade buttons and again instead of health and speed amounts we're going to have some buttons in here and I want to Simply take the buttons from our main menu that we made our quit and play button that for some reason is spared but if we hit play here you can see they appear again these two cool buttons right here I'm just going to take the play one copy that go back into the main level find our UI overlay our upgrade menu go on our upgrade buttons and paste that in there and uh you can see it works just fine but we need to take our upgrade buttons here and move this entire thing uh so we're going to move it over uh I actually want to scale in the attributes a bit here move place the upgrade buttons somewhere there I can just duplicate these so we can see what it looks like if we have two side by side scale them in kind of like that then we can take um then we can add some padding and we can also add some spacing so I want a spacing of maybe um five actually a bit more maybe 10 and then maybe uh 10 on the top and 10 on the bottom some something like that looks pretty good uh but I want to play around with these buttons but because I'm not entirely satisfied with how they look uh so I'm going to take the effect distance here change that to a two and ative 2 I think that's actually a lot better already and I kind of like how that looks then we can go and expand it this and then uh change the text to oops to upgrade and uh the font sign we're going to have to bring that down a bit to maybe 36 nope 33 Okay so I think we are going to go with something like 26 there that looks pretty good and uh instead of making this black we could also make it some kind of like appealing orange yellowish color no that doesn't look too good uh we could add an outline on the upgrade but I think that would add Too Many Colors I actually like this black just like this this and then we can rename this to an upgrade button and we can delete the play button there and then simply duplicate this uh but I also want to um remove the event trigger here uh remove component we have the animator and all that which is fine and uh let's just try and duplicate that and hit play and see if it works if we hover over these and again the game is playing in the background so uh you are going to be hearing shot noises uh it's not currently paused or anything we're not checking if this is open uh but you can see just how nice these buttons actually feel uh so I really like this animation and I think we're just going to uh stick with this uh one thing that I might want to do is actually make some kind of uh uh image that goes that kind of covers our entire health and our entire upgrade uh and that will kind of need us to restructure this a little bit so I'm kind of making some of this up on the go which is definitely something that you're going to have to do when designing a UI it is a creative process so um I excuse if I haven't thought this uh all the way through which I have not um so I'm going to take the health amount here and just duplicate this and move it out of the attribute so we can kind of experiment with it up here and uh yeah so this is the health amount and that's fine uh I'm also going going to make an uh empty object so create empty here and this is going to be called attribute and it's going to be storing the amount and a button so uh we can take our health amount and drag it on the attribute and we can take whoops before we do that I want to take the attribute here and just scale it to the health amount here it's going to be fine and then take our health amount under the attribute there we go and uh the health amount um we want this to scale with the attribute uh from there but we don't want it to scale on the other direction so we only want it to scale there so we can kind of do this yeah that's very nice and then uh we down here we need some kind of button and that's going to be our upgrade button so we're going to take that duplicate it and again put it under our attribute and drag it up here and we can drag the button in there actually uh instead let's take our attribute and drag that out a bit size that up take our upgrade button drag that there and there and uh we want this to scale uh with the side but not with the x axis I believe so this way we can do this yes that's perfect so it actually scales and it moves uh but it doesn't scale on on the wrong axis so now that we have this idea of an attribute we can simply put different attributes under the attributes group here so we can delete the upgrade buttons and we can delete our two attributes and simply take our one attribute here and place that on your attrib so you can see how that looks and we then of course need to make this wider there we go and uh when we now duplicate this attribute you can see just how smooth uh that is and we can then go under our attributes uh object and add some padding just as we did before so that's that's going to be 10 10 and 10 and there we go so that makes it a lot easier to add new attributes and I think it it's just more uh logical overall so this is going to be our health attribute and this is going to be our speed uh attribute there we go and you can of course preab Alize this if you want to make it into a preab that's completely fine and this is of course going to be instead of writing what kind of amount it is I'm just going to write amount and this is going to be our speed and it's going to be defaulted to 10 so I think this is a lot better if you structure it this way and therefore that's what we are going to do so we have our attributes and everything should scale nicely with the screen this is parented to the center so you will notice if I go ahead and do this uh if we have a very tiny screen our astronaut will actually overlap with our properties but again this will require a very uh small screen uh so I think we will be okay with that for now at least um you can of course go ahead and change how these things move uh on different screen sizes um I mean if we go ahead and choose uh the smallest possible screen here you can see it does overlap a little bit uh so we can maybe take our astronaut just move him out here so that he doesn't overlap with the properties and this way our game is kind of future proof no matter what screen we want to display it on so that's fine and um yeah I believe that is all we needed to do with the UI work let me just check how long I've been recording here yeah so this is already almost 20 minutes and therefore I'm going to cut off the recording here and we're going to continue in the next video by actually scripting some functionality into this so we're going to actually make our upgrade menu do something this was just uh the very beginning of a a very cool system A system that I definitely want your feedback on so if you have any great ideas on uh what you want to see in this uh upgrade uh menu system uh definitely write them in the comment section you can also visit the braet forum both uh with suggestions or if you want to ask some questions about how you can Implement your own ideas if I'm not able to cover them in the tutorial so that was basically it for this video stay tuned for the next one and I'll see you there oh
