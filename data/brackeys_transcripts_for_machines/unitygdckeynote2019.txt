course it kicks off right now but it also kicks off tomorrow with our developer day where we have a bunch of sessions on things like machine learning multiplayer spatial computing things like that and if you're not lucky enough to be at GDC which many of you aren't you can pick them up afterwards in a GDC vault we also have talks on our booth which we'll be broadcasting all week and you can also pick those up on our YouTube channel for free of course afterwards absolutely great stuff lots of great talks on the booth as well so we've got visual effects Graff we've got shader graph we've got

remember to subscribe to our YouTube channel and to catch those after the fact so speaking of our booth where the talks are we have a huge presence of GDC this year one of the most massive booths I've ever seen in my entire life it's a weird flex but okay it's in the South Hall number 227 or just look for the giant you know you miss it if you've got any burning unity questions that you want to ask whether it's like from graphics to like mobile we have an answer bar so please come along and talk to our experts we're there to answer your questions and we'd love for you to join us exactly and we also have demos so a lot of the content that you see in the keynote tonight you'll be able to come along and get handson with see that there are all real projects and play around with them we also have two big factors of our connected game strategy vive ox and multi play there and you'll be able to see how their services can help you make a network game and be successful speaking of multi play if you're not familiar with multiplayer they joined the unity family recently and we have a quick trailer to show you exactly what they have to offer so let's take a look at the multi play trailer right now happy hours incredible so please come in talk to multiplayer on the into booth so if you like unity and you like being happy you can come along to our happy hours on the booth on Wednesday and Thursday so following will and IRISA Scott's roadmap talk on Wednesday that's at 400 p.m. there's a 4 p.m. yep you can come join the happy hour and then on Thursday we have a diversity and inclusion discussion and you can join us to the happy hour then exactly speaking of partners you can also come and talk to Nintendo Oh toy Samsung Google Microsoft they're all going to be on our booth so if you want to talk about getting your game onto their platforms come along chat to them and figure it all out speaking of partners though magically please oh my goodness yes so tell me about it magic is on the unity booth this week showing off their mixed reality game dr. gourd bot it's been announced at GDC this week that they're bringing multiplayer to this mixed reality experience so let's take a little look at a trailer before we speak to mr. Yu [Laughter] so we are joined her by mr. Yu who is actually a great board mark their director I would thank you so much for joining us it's so great to meet you very nice to meet you and thank you for having me of course so dr. Claude book mr. Lee's last year on magical eat one singleplayer experience just tell us a little bit more about wetter and you working with magically to create this awesome experience yeah so I'm from where to workshop as people might know it's a physical affection workshop famous for doing film and so on so we're not a place known for doing games but during our travels we met this Chet brownie above its who is the CEO of magic leap and he and caught wind of this dr. bloodbought swore that I was creating and asked me if he would if we would come and make a game for him for this crazy new system he was imagining where you basically would better put the virtual things in the real world play a game literally in your own space and for me personally that was super exciting so we jumped into their adventure with him straightaway and made our first game draft of robots invaders so before we get into the multiplayer what's the singleplayer experience like so the singleplayer game like I said is a game that takes place in your own home the medical device is astonishing it can scan your house and then we on the game end we examine that and we build nav measures and we've replaced basically robots in a whole robot world into your own home with you and the fun part of that as well as I wanted to really bring characters to life and this because I think this medium is amazing for storytelling so we have Stephen Fry playing dr. broad board we have Rhys Darby playing gimble our AI companion and we have Lucy Lawless featuring at the end of the game as well who's one of our sort of characters that leads on into the future of what happens with this story so what happens when you take that singleplayer experience to multiplayer what do people see when they're interacting together yes so even at the tail end of developing the game we were we started to realize that we really wanted to explore multiplayer and have people share their experiences because on the medically one you're kind of you still in the real world you can still see everything around you but you are having this unique experience and no one else can see it so we wanted to solve that problem immediately yeah so we're showing off at the unity booth broad battle which is a very early prototype sort of a glimpse into the potential future of what shared experiences and multiplayer can be and mixed reality in spatial computing and in this particular experience you you get to customize yourself choose a character and then you well literally I'm gonna say but virtually transform yourself you see yourself as another character you're customizing your head and you can see where you're looking yes so we you look your character's eyes look when you talk your character's mouth moves okay it's quite a surreal transformative experience and so we're really excited to show people because I think it sort of signposts something really exciting for the future of spatial computing so then people can come to the booth and try this you're going to be holding some Tech Talks write about the development business so Thomas Hall one of our amazing engineers who's actually the lead on multiplayer he's talking about what he's done with unity to bring multiplayer into that and James Everett one of the lead game designers and producer is talking about the entire games experience and sharing that tomorrow at the RDC great thanks so much for coming I just wanted to mention there's a hard thing to talk about but in New Zealand just in the last few days we had a horrible horrible event that's stunned us all and left us feeling raw and sorry it's it's hard to talk about but I just wanted to direct people anyone who cares or wants to help there's a New Zealand website called give a little code on E&Z you can go there and and try and support the people who've been directly affected so it's not super funny but I think it really matters so yeah please reach out and help if you can okay so we have an advisory panel also at GDC bit weird segue but here we are but maybe you'd like a magic leap from it right that is a good if you'd like to win your own magic leap headset and play doctor robot then you can win that by joining up an advisory panel during GDC week yep so the advisory panel if you're not sure it's a great way for the community to be able to talk to us directly talk to us directly here unity so based on your interest you can opt in if certain activities to give us feedback and in return we'll give you like unity discounts and gift cards and even donate to charity so please please this week of GDC if you sign up for the advisory board you'll be in a sweepstake for a magic so go to unity comm slash advisory panel or to jump into that and sign up so if you've just joined us the keynote is kicking off in we're looking at around about six and a half minutes something like that and you're in the right place the stream is right here you're in the pipes place don't go anywhere grab your snacks grab your drinks grab your pets so we've got some exciting announcements tonight it's stuff that you're really not gonna want to miss and it's stuff that you probably haven't seen much of before which you really cool it makes me very happy so what kind of things can we expect well I'd like to see a little bit of something to do with the new innovations in creating augmented reality that's a very good point Liz but I've heard this is a rumor the augmented reality is come a long way in the last couple of years it is it wouldn't it be great if we had a video of all the awesome augmented reality content that our development community was surprised we do amazing let's take a look at some great AR and VR games made with unity amazing it's great to see all that awesome augmented reality content so what's going on the keynotes we've got some industry legends here joining us we have our inspector who's going to be doing a shocking reveal about what other side entertainment are up to no spoilers here and we're also gonna see of course lore laning from odd world to talk about the latest in the world of Abe as a very cool say that coming I really like it when they nope okay and we also have our VP of graphics Natalia Tatar track here to talk about both the new demo from the Book of the Dead team and Adam team it's it's it's very very pretty and it has I mean I can't spoil it but there's also a realtime ray tracing demo which you can take a look at on our social channels as well if you look on Facebook or YouTube or Twitter we've done a demo with BMW it's beautiful it's amazing and it's it's real time rate racing inside of unity which is pretty cool and mentioned previously our CTO yochem is gonna be here to show us the latest innovations in the data oriented tech stack so stay tuned get comfortable get a drink so speaking of things are made with unity yeah because I always have the IGF and game developers Choice Awards are of course up honestly and we wanted to call out just a few games that are made with unity that are nominated for these awards that we think are extra core so Liz you were telling me about return of the Oh burden right yes it's absolutely fantastic so you'll hear a lot of people talking about its incredible art style it's very is gorgeous but it's so much more than that it's a really smart detective game where you're trying to find out with limited resources what happened to the crew and I just really recommend it congratulations to Lucas Pope for the nominations for this and as if to create a complete contrast to over 10 I've been playing a lot of beat Sabre by beat games beat Sabre is it's just a joy like I mean I I drum not very well I would add and so I play this uneasy but it's so much fun it's it's the best experience and also just come to PlayStation VR as well it's on PlayStation 4 and regardless of platform I am terrible at it on all platforms speaking of platforms I've been playing a platformer so Chris Bynum at a studio is this beautiful like painterly platforming exploration experience I can't really explain it it's kind of like a personal journey that feels like it's about love and loss and all these kind of incredible things well it sounds like it will make me cry much like Florence which is another nominee so yeah performance by mountains you've been playing that haven't you been playing it you get through it very quickly that's a short experience but it's this beautiful just story of a couple meeting and getting together and I'm not gonna spoil what happens but you've really just got our experiences it's just like it's like when you see a really great like indie romcom and kind of thing and it just sort of like tugs at the heartstrings so you've gotta try it on iOS go and get it florence by mountains and congratulations to all of the nominees and you're all winners to us so so of course all of those games were made with unity and we're here to celebrate all of that tonight with some great new tech and also to see some of the games that are coming up and just to remind you number 2019 of unity is actually ready to go so we have 20 19.1 in beta so you or beta I should say because I'm in America beta you can go and download the beta from the unity hub and just install it and try it out and we've got a whole bunch of new stuff exciting stuff for you to try out so how about the editor first there's a lot of great editor functionality here one of the things that I think is super useful really exciting is improvements to the so so we now have a clickable stack trace and there's also search functionality so you can really drill down to whatever it's causing you there's problems yeah so if you suck at programming like I do you can find out where you've gone wrong there's also a shortcut manager which is like it's it's a godsend it's a really obvious thing to have a shortcut manager in some software a little bit behind on that one but it's here now it's great you can bind anything to whatever you need to you can find conflicts between keyboard shortcuts and you can even share maps so if you want to have your whole studio working on the same keyboard shortcuts it's super super useful is great it basically allows you to group things if you're working on a big scene with all kinds of different stuff and you really want to just focus on in one area you can just group things without having to switch off game objects was just really wonderful things is timeline signals so if you've been wanting to trigger events from certain frames in your timeline you now can do so and if you want to find out more about this we actually have a talk on the booth on Thursday at 100 p.m. that one of our evangelist Shiro is going to be doing so please come in check that out yeah and there's the new yes new input system okay that's super useful so so thank you to everybody who has been jumping on the beater and trying out so far it's it's really great that you give us all of these bug reports and help make unity better and this the sooner you try it out the sooner won't be battle tested and ready to rock so I'm being told that the keynote is going to start very very shortly that's true so make sure you've got your drink make sure you're comfortable make sure that you're ready to go that you've ramped up and you're excited because it's not much time left I'm excited so what we got quick overview what's come in graphics mobile triple a supersecret thing I can't talk about we're ready to go in 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 have a great keynote let's go my first game it was not good it was so bad it was just extremely buggy I mean it was a mess like none of us knew what we were doing oh my god it was horrible but worth it making games is a hard craft on its own it is probably intimidating is challenging it's really hard but you have this whole community that can help you out with anything there are a lot of other people you can draw on you'll have created an entire world even if it's a small world you'll have created a living world that didn't exist before and there's nothing more powerful than that I really want to make game stats that have amazing performance that look beautiful but making it easy to do that you have a ball of clay in your hands a ball of digital clay to make something that you really believe in my name is Matthew Wagner and I'm one of the earliest users of unity backer newest version 1.6 my name is Alessandro Canosa my name is Murari Vasudevan I'm Samantha Kalman I'm Moe Goldstein I'm seven cargo and welcome welcome welcome I am your commander and welcome to unity please welcome John Ricca Telo so welcome and we all know making games is really really hard and to celebrate your hard work let's take a look at some of the games we've seen just in the last year from the huge number of great unity developers love that stuff so now at unity we're super proud to be the digital clay of choice for millions of passionate creators and players around the world those here at GDC and the people in that video and for those tuning in on the livestream welcome and congratulations on your great work now you are the developers creating the games of tomorrow today and we believe fundamentally at unity that the world is a better place with more creators in it this belief is at the core of everything we do at unity it inspires us every day whether you're a developer opening unity editor for the first time or an artist reshaping a world with the power of realtime 3d you inspire us to keep us making unity better more performant and a more empowering platform we absolutely love that you start here with us and you go wherever your creativity takes you now going back to our founding over 15 years ago the core of who we are really hasn't changed we're engineers and product people who care deeply about you the game developer we invested our technology and our services and our workflows to empower your game ideas and successes today we solve or try to solve hard problems so that you can focus on the content the creativity and the imagination it takes to bring a game to life we're not here to make games we have no interest in creating experiences that compete with your hobbies or your businesses and we're here to build the unity platform and services for you the developer now up on the wall behind me there's a list of some of the larger developers that use unity and we're super proud of this group people but we wouldn't be who we are today and where we are today without the support of the indie community take a look at some of the amazing Studios in attendance with us here tonight and I really thank you for showing up and being here and what a success you've had 45% of the top thousand mobile games today are made by developers using unity that's all of you more than a third and people don't always know that what are the third of all PC and console games are built in unity in seven out of ten of the top games on iOS and Android right now are made with unity and we serve the developer community in three ways I'm going to talk you through all three I want to start with create now first we help you create the best product we allow you to work efficiently across teams worldwide and with developer and artist workflows that support you through the process now right now unity is undeniably the best development platform platform for mobile but today we have line of sight so that unity will be the best high end performance platform for PC and console we're making seriously powerful advancements with the entity component system the csharp job system and other technologies that make up part of our data oriented technology stack and because of unities modularity you can use the tech you want when you need it without being burdened to adapt to new technologies before you need them just think in many ways you'll be in control and being able to use unity to create your own game engine to carry only the technologies you need for the game you're building now we'll talk a lot more about this super powerful idea around power and flexibility throughout 2019 but with all that flexibility and power you also have the confidence of knowing that your games are optimized for over 25 platforms maybe even a platform of tomorrow you don't yet know about now we're excited to be partnering with Google on their cloud games initiative and I'd encourage you all to tune in tomorrow at 1000 a.m. and watch what they have to share it is absolutely spectacular now the second area we do after you create the game you have to operate it and we help you operate your game in the real world with services today that welcome all creators because at unity our operate tools work with unity games and game was built on other game engines and these services have powered the operation of the two most defining moments in gaming so far in 2019 now some of you probably know I'm talking about fortnight's marshmallow concert millions of people talking in realtime ^ unities v vox voice service and then there's apex legends millions of users playing simultaneously through the power of unities multi play backend hosting service now let's take a look at both of these a little closer and how they can help you agnostic of what game engine your product is built on a V box is the most recent addition to the Unity family and is the leading provider of voice and text chat and the proven goto solution for linking hundreds of the hundreds of millions of players together in some of the biggest multiplayer online games ever products like fortnight and pub G and League of Legends in fact today it was announced that V box will be available inside of the unity of the unreal ecosystem so you can get VIP Vox voice services without a separate SDK download and then there's multiplayer the leading online game server hosting solution it's also a unity service available to all developers regardless of development choice and multiplayer has helped deliver resilient scalable solutions for some of the industry's most battletested online experiences like titanfall one of my favorites rocket League and a game you've probably heard just a little bit about these last few weeks apex legends now this is a rocket apex Legends reached 1 million unique users in the first eight hours 10 million players in the first 72 hours including 2 million concurrent players in the first weekend and ultimately 50 million players in the first month these are huge numbers and the backend service that supported this that helped make it possible his unity zone multiplayer and what you get you get an optimal blend of three things a large costeffective infrastructure in baremetal the ability to spin up thousands of servers in a second with the Google cloud platform and an operating team at multiplayer providing the backend operating service that most developers could only dream to realize it's great to see apex legends achieving such success worldwide but then what is worldwide for many of you the biggest game market in the world can be hard to penetrate and that's China and here at unity we have deep experience and expertise in China two great examples arena valor the number one mobile game in the world boasting over a hundred million registered users is built on unity as is king of Avalon with 60 million registered players both massive games operating ax Cale both of which are built on unity and today we're announcing a new partnership that'll help you operate your games in the world's largest gaming market $0.10 and unity we're announcing that $0.10 cloud is unities connected games partner in China with the largest gaming community base but it's no secret that $0.10 is an expert empowering the best and the brightest and the most successful in China and I've got some great news for all of you you can start using the unity $0.10 cloud service this year not today but later this year so we could help you get started in ways you never could before now we look forward to working closely with $0.10 in bringing unity games to the masses of passionate gamers in China but now we've covered create and operate I want to shift gears and talk about something that is near and dear to your heart the third way we can show up and help you support your game in the marketplace this is monetize it maybe near to your heart I know it's near and dear to your wallet now we all know you create games not everyone to make money some it's just a hobby but we have the technology and services to ensure maximum player enjoyment engagement and monetization we're way more than an ad network we've created some truly innovative tech technologies and products that ensure that your maximized player enjoyment and engagement and not just going exclusively for the dollars and our tools make optimal use of data and machine learning to ensure you get the right ads served at the right time and importantly when it's better not to serve it out at all then no ad is served now Unity's Unified auction offers a fair and unbiased chance for all advertisers to win the bid for the ad in kind of regardless of who they are driving higher bids faster ad serving and ultimately more revenue for you now we've also got technologies delighted mix it up a bit innovations like AR advertising that allow you bring your creations into the physical world now unity helps you with the most revenue while delivering a great player experience and this is nothing short of breathtaking here's an interesting thing that you might not know the ads team has done such a great job of taking all these factors into account and making unity the third largest video ad network behind only Google and Facebook our network is also engine agnostic in fact even our friends at epic use the unity network to acquire users for fortnight and to give you some sense of the scale in the last month alone we Reese ever 1.7 billion unique devices with unity ads and we served over 10 and a half billion ads in virtually every month in the last six months this is a massive opportunity for reach and it will help you monetize your game that a scale that perhaps you haven't been thinking now we help you create we help you honor operate and we help you monetize now tonight many folks in the Unity team some of our brightest minds are going to talk to you about other innovations we're going to talk about mobile leadership highlighting the performance that you can get with a lightweight render pipeline the C sharp job system the burst compiler the AAA our foundation framework then we're going to talk about the tech of tomorrow I'm going to do that in two parts performance and graphics we'll discuss how our new performance features the entity component system make up the technology stack that can help you move forward and we're gonna talk about graphics and we'll give you an extended look at our realtime ray tracing demo which was just unveiled and Nvidia is GCC conference a few hours ago and we're gonna unveil the newest demo for the team that created Book of the Dead there's a lot to cover let's dive in thanks and enjoy the show please welcome Chris Plummer last year we announced a collaboration with Tencent to develop an allnew mobile experience from the start we had one goal in mind singularly focused on developing the definitive firstperson action experience in an original freetoplay title designed exclusively for Android and iOS gamers built in unity and coming to the West please take a first look at Call of Duty mobile thank you and call duty mobile we're bringing together beloved maps competitive game modes and signature combat mechanics from across the franchise including call of duty black ops and call of duty modern warfare and much more to come all this together for the first time and one awesome FPS experience is built in unity anywhere anytime from their smartphones and tablets players can jump into visceral call duty firefights and then they can jump in an upgrade their custom load outs with skills perks scorestreaks and then compete to be among the very best in the world we're delivering a deep game with a variety of ways players can compete today we're excited to reveal the call dudes fan favorite multiplayer modes will feature prominently in Call of Duty mobile exploring a suite of multiplayer options you can pick from your favorite competitive modes like team deathmatch search and destroy and freeforall and then jump into intense fiveonfive action set in iconic Call of Duty Maps like crash hijacked nuketown and many more this is console called the PvP action in the palm of your hand our teams are committed to delivering the triplea quality and performance the call duty fans come to expect we're talking 60 frames per second low latency and super silky and responsive controls to fully realize Call of Duty on mobile we sought out the best development partners using the best technology for the job so you start with Call of Duty the number one selling console game franchise in the US for 10 consecutive years and 10 cent with their incredible experience building some of the most successful mobile shooters on the entire planet and built in unity this has given us the performance and the visual fidelity and also the flexibility to capture that authentic call duty experience onto mobile for call duty and mobile this is a perfect match now to take a closer look at the game help me welcome $0.10 director of technology shadow goooo let's start by taking a look at the material system we use the physics base rendering using unity shader systems which has made it really easy for us to set up our own render pipeline all the visible elements are fully physically based and support advanced features that you would only expect to see on game consoles like full image based lighting and specular occlusion using bent normal the physics base render pipeline is used for scene elements and then we use unity sprite light probes which are placed procedurally as you can see here for dynamic global illumination we also use reflection probes for metallic enhancements so lighting features are so important for scene rendering and to achieve that immersive call duty look we combine static shadow masks with dynamic cascaded shadow maps and the combined lighting results are something you would never expect to see on a mobile device now let's talk about animation so we've been able to achieve some really awesome animation effects and called dirty mobile we start with unities animator controller which has provided excellent flexibility so the programmers and animators can get exactly what they want in addition the team was able to build upon Unity's builtin physics and as you can see from these test dummies we've built our own custom and verse kinematic and ragdoll system now what's great about this is for our animators they don't have to worry about key framing every little keyframe now we can just work on the really important animations and let the procedural systems do the rest to work when it all comes together it just looks awesome Thank You shadow we've seen just a small slice of call duty mobile there's so much more to show and we look forward to sharing it with you soon the place has seen is going great we really couldn't be happier with how it's shaping up now beginning today you can preregister for the game at call of duty com / mobile we're going to be launching a public beta so sign up to be among the first to know I really hope you enjoyed this exclusive first look at called duty mobile and we wish you a great GDC thanks please welcome Stephen Sullivan welcome to kingdoms of heckfire an impressive realtime strategy game by a stinking ape there are successful mobile game studio from Vancouver Canada with millions of lifetime players imagine if you wanted to build a game like this without their resources not only would you have to figure out how to make your game fun and truly unique you'd also have to build a number of laborintensive boilerplate game systems I've worked as an engineer and producer so I know this problem all too well in this industry every day matters I regret that I spent many of those days building things like inventory currency management virtual stores and player progress instead of working on the experiences I really wanted to create almost all these gameplay systems are common for every successful game so if you want to make mobile games you have to build and rebuild game system after game system after game system after game system after game system so now my team wants to enable you to save time to focus on what matters making your game truly unique and fun we got this idea because we've built this before with the unity inapp purchase plugin we saved the headache of worrying if your transactions would work on ten different platforms and we removed this nightmare for thousands of developers that reach over 800 million Mau as a result we saved each developer days of development time and now we want to save you weeks or months of engineering time with game foundation game foundation gives you common components for building game systems in the editor you can use the UI or API directly instead of worrying how you're going to name things and what parameters to use from scratch game foundation gives you prebuilt libraries let's see an example here we're gonna add an awesome dragon bundle to our game once you have the bundle add in your the name description and then you decide which things you're gonna pay out when somebody buys it what you'll notice is the currencies that you've predefined are already wired into this system so then all you have to do is add a payout amount for each next you need to add a little magic from your art team to make sure it's a good purchase experience and then you're ready to launch the game so here we see the game world and you can see your bundle show up in your store and then the player makes a purchase the nice thing is this system's already prewired together your new gems are added to the players State on disk currencies are deducted and all the items are added to the inventory so you can see how quick and easy it is to create and change your games at the vaults and that's not all with this system you also get automatic data instrumentation which helps drive deep insights without having to write any additional code what used to take 30 days or I don't know 4 to 3200 minutes now can be done in an hour or 60 minutes just think about what you could do with the extra 43,000 minutes you could build something like a thinking ape did you could focus on the unique stuff that makes your game fun and oneofakind game foundation will be available as a unity package in q2 thank you please welcome IRISA scoff last year we introduced great new graphics functionality into preview this year you're gonna see a lot of amazing tech being moved into being production ready let's take a look at two of the most exciting features coming out of preview in 2019 dot one lightweight and shader graph shader graph is a simple yet powerful node based system that allows artists to author shaders visually without having to write any code you can drag and drop nodes in real time and see the results immediately which speeds up experimentation iteration the instant feedback makes debugging and tuning simple artists are empowered to create or freely and intuitively and one of the gamechanging features that's coming in 2019 dot one are nested sub graphs so a sub graph is a visual solution for making a custom node that you define directly in shader graph now that sub graphs are nest of all that makes them a versatile solution for defining a custom content library for your project or studio this gives your technical artists the ability to have nondestructive control over your entire shader pipeline empowering your artists to work freely and safely light we render pipeline has been signed from the ground up to offer the most scalable solution for unity graphics it's available as a csharp package making the rendering code completely customizable to get the results you need to make a beautiful looking game it's lean and optimized so that allows for peak performance at a variety of platforms and we now have a custom renderer system which replaces callbacks and command buffer injection but with the ease of being set up entirely through editor UI no code required you can always dig in it's amazing to have this level of control best of all these are both available now and production ready with 20 19.1 so let's take a look at these features in action please welcome Jake beagle disruptive games is an indie studio based right across the bay in downtown Berkeley we're a small team of 12 very passionate developers with decades of experience working to places like insomniac Activision and Electronic Arts our first game megalith released earlier this year on playstation vr since then we were looking at ways to expand our audience and even at platforms beyond VR when Unity approached us with a challenge to create a mobile demo we jumped at the chance because of this we had a lot to do we had to change engines change platforms and we even just switched our perspective from first person to third person and we had to do it in a very short amount of time luckily using unities lightweight render pipeline and their powerful tools we're able to create a demo that our team is very proud of and I'm gonna show you a slice of today now I'd like to introduce our studio art director Jed Melnick and Lucas Myers from you need technology to walk you through how this demo was possible thank you everyone hey Jed welcome thank you so lightweight render pipelines going out of preview with 2019 at 100 and you've been using it to create this again that's right can you talk us through what you did to make this thing come to life yeah well coming into the project there was a lot of concern about lighting and performance I had worked on mobile devices before and a lot of the times there's a lot of trickery involved and we have to do a lot of pre baking to get the light to really work on mobile but with the lightweight render pipeline it just came out of the box working dynamically across the whole scene you can see here that we have realtime shadows across the entire scene and you can any light lips here which know like all these shadows are that's all this is all working all all direct light is is dynamic what's what are all these red lights on the right side so the red lights this is our little light show platform here you can see hello and it's all working using perpixel lighting across the entire environment what it's a lot of reflections on the ground how did you how did you make those so those are pre baked cue maps that we that again out of the box very easy for us to use the Sun as well that's right yeah the Sun as well the sun's dynamic so you can see the per pixel specular gliding over it right there and these these laser towers are they they're just shooting realtime lights yeah so that's just using the out of out of the box the effects editor and you just attach a light to one of the particle effects and they just send it down the row great did you have to do any special material work and that for this project yeah so shader graph was huge for us we use it across the entire map you can see this little red ring kind of booming at the base right here look that's all done in shader graph by one artist so it just takes a day for an artist to do it and this is a huge difference for us because back in the day it used to be an artist and an engineer working together and they had to kind of sync up their visions and it took a lot of time but now we just have an artist working on it directly and it exactly what they need it to be well what kind of hardware does this require this is originally we were targeting highend mobile devices but this is just I phone 8 so for me I have an 1/8 and it just works great did you use the shadowgraph for anything else uh yeah so let me look around here real quick so you can see that there's a gradient across the entire environment so you can see the what do you mean sand enos down here and you can see kind of the more burnt orange towards the top that's that's all dynamic so you can take this rock and you can kind of move it up and down and it's all done worldspace gradient in the shader by an artist yeah and all very performant the other part that's great about the shader graph is we got wind in there without a problem you can see right here on the leaves you can see a lot of kind of dancing around over here you can see more foliage and that's all just done with shader graph by an artist very easy to do and very short amount of time that's great I really love this example of a project that uses lightweight render pipeline and shader graph to bring these kinds of graphics to mobile let's take a look at another mobile game Thanks please welcome Kevin summers Disney sort of arena conjures up a world where players unleash Disney and Pixar characters onto strategic battlefields players build custom teams of champions and villains from a deep vault of collectible characters each with their own unique abilities let's check out some gameplay here we are entering the final encounter of a battle where your squad is facing off with Captain Hook as you can see the team really captured each character's unique style and personality each character was hand drawn by our artists and while inspired by the classic Disney art style our game features a detailed angular and celshaded look we've stayed uptodate with unity throughout our development recently they've released features that were critical in bringing Disney sources arena to life we've used cinema sheen and nested prefabs to quickly and easily build our environments but the lightweight render pipeline was the real star for us as it helps us reach 60 frames per second on a wide range of mobile devices some more than two years old and it wasn't just about performance the lightweight render pipeline also granted us access to unities new shader graph feature which really gave our artists a lot more control and flexibility and for me as an engineer this meant less time that I need has been building and maintaining custom shaders winwin Disney source of arena is currently in beta but Franz and Lucas are going to show you how our team utilize shader graph thank you hey Fras hey Lucas look at that all these Disney characters in my favorite tool I think that's so cool I'm so happy we have this game you're on stage you were the visual effects editor correct or designer what is it designer artists yeah on this project can you take us through some of the tricks you use to make this game come together sure so let's dive into Ariel's water effects over there so this was the cool piece of concept art that we started out with and with this as our target I was inspired by a few techniques that I'd write about and shada graph was pretty instrumental in bringing this into the game it looks like a render yeah so let's actually look at how water material so up here on the left you can see I have a few parameters that I can mess around with colors to change and but these two textures do a lot of the heavy lifting so I like I see the waters rotating is that like a rotating masher does that all come from the material that's all done in the shader yeah so like yeah I can like you know make it like more flowy and so on can we take a look at the graph yes so I'll show you a simple trick that we use to tense stuff in the game so I sample the texture over here that you see at the bottom and then you know one with the green and red exactly and then like I take the green Channel multiply that by a color take the red Channel do the same and add them together and then we can tint it to whatever colors we want a game that sounds really confident you just use a water texture good question versatility so if we look at this quad it has the exact same material on it so what I'm gonna do is just change the noise texture to be something a little bit more Fiolek and change the colors to be a little bit orange maybe and you can already start seeing you know the water tone into something a little bit more like a two style dial you're using the same graph for different effects exactly actually over here I have a few more effects that I made using the same technique like I even use it with a particle system out there Wow looks cool thanks did you use yes actually this on Haiti's hair and I came there all the time yeah he was hanging out in the background and in in game when he gets angry like we changed his hair to a fiery red and he goes into a rage yeah you changes the run time yeah hey you've been doing this job for a very long time how would you approach making effects like these before you had shader graph it was a bit more of an involved process where I'd have to work with an engineer like Kevin oh yeah shader graph is so flexible and as an artist it's really empowered me to like you know get the creative look envision that we really want in the game well great I think it looks really great and I'm really thanks France it's amazing and for us at unity it's such a big important step up to make sure that the visual control of what your material don't mind me these guys look at me that the visual control of what your material looks like what your game looks like is in the hands of artists like Franz and like Jed where it belongs now we've been looking at a few mobile titles that use the lightweight render pipeline but the lightweight render pipeline is also the thing that powers our AR and VR features so let's take a look at some of those please welcome Brittany Edmund and Dan Miller a dim when they told us to make ourselves at home up here I don't think they meant to bring our living room huh well might as well take advantage of it I guess it's an exciting time for augmented reality with new features and technology being released for both handheld and wearable platforms and people are getting used to the idea of using their phones for more from using them to take pictures with dinosaurs at the park to visualizing what furniture could look like in their homes before they purchase it we're really just starting to scratch the surface of the potential of this technology in a unity we want to give you the resources to stay on the bleeding edge of augmented reality today we'll be talking about a our foundation we built a framework specifically for a our creators that gives you the ability to build your application once and deploy a crossbow with a our kit and a our core enabled devices we've also included additional features to help you overcome some of the other common challenges of era development from anchoring your digital object in the real world to the visual fidelity of those digital objects and more we've taken assets from the FPS sample and converted them from the HD render pipeline to the lightweight render pipeline since we're targeting mobile devices and in playing with these assets we're going to show you some of the features that you can take advantage of with a our foundation by demonstrating how you can take assets that you've already created for your non AR project and use them to create an AR project that looks great run smoothly and is available on the 1 billion mobile devices that are AR enabled around the world today an enabling era foundation in your editor is as easy as going to the package manager since we've already done that we can go ahead and hop in today I'm going to be using a feature called AR remote which allows me to connect an AR enabled mobile device to the unity editor from here we can start placing content in the world and building iterating and developing without having to compile it to the device every single time Dan is able to place content directly onto planes in the real world by clicking his mouse in the editor seeing these types of changes in real time will save you a ton of time as you're working I'm using something called a our foundation samples which is a collection of assets and resources already put together so that you can start building in augmented reality today let's go ahead and replace those spheres with an instance of our terraformer character and see what she looks like on the stage now restarting the remote is as simple as hitting the play button and is dance working you're noticing the blurriness in the camera feed in the editor this is because we're using something called the downscale factor which lowers the resolution of the camera but on the flip side it gives us a little more performance as we continue to iterate and our character is looking good but she's not fully matching the lighting that we have going on on stage to solve this we can use light estimation which is a fundamental technology of air kit and air core but they both do it a little bit differently because we're using air foundation we can simply enable this once and have it work across both platforms let's go ahead and look at what she looks like now you can see now she's a little bit brighter because of the stage lights and if they did then she gets a little bit darker too and I want to make sure that you don't miss that dan has been working directly in the unity editor because AR is just another build platform for unity and all of the workflows and the features and the new tech that we're building from the lightweight render pipeline to the entity component system all work for mobile AR and you can see how seamless of a process it was to take assets you've created in unity and bring them into augmented reality and we spiced up this demo a little bit more than just placing a character in the scene so Brittany once you go and grab it the iPad and show them what we made absolutely so we created a custom sequence using timeline that allowed us to add in a couple these extra cool moments but Dan just referenced and one thing I want to highlight is that Brittany is now using an AR kit enabled iOS device before we're developing on an AR core enabled Android device switching between air kit and AR core is as easy as switching build targets and unity a our foundation does all the heavy lifting huh what we got going on up stage you know I just thought it would be a nice touched if we added a couple plants from our terraformers home planet before we welcomed her on just to make her feel a little bit more welcome so now what come on whoa she's a little bit taller than I expected do you want to see something cool sure whoa where'd she go oh she's still here notice that even though she's transparent you can still tell where she is on the stage because of the way that her body warps the digital and the physical objects behind her also I want to point out her shadow when she's transparent she doesn't have one but if we bring her back notice that not only does she have a shadow but it's a shadow of her actual body it's not just a blob unity gives us the power to make these seemingly tiny creative decisions but actually have a big impact on making our terraformer feel like she's actually in Dan's living room with us it'll be perfectly honest I don't really know how to program shaders this effect was all created using the visual node editor available in shader graph since we're using lightweight render pipeline and AR Foundation we're able to easily pull in the camera feed into a node to create many cool visual effects like this and more and whoa those are the spaceships from mega city rendering an AR how many have 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 to land here is that the reason why we're able to get so many spaceships working in AR is because we're taking advantage of the dataoriented tech stack which also allows us to really take advantage of the hardware that were using that's pretty impressive over 7000 unique entities all rendering in AR at a solid 60 frames a second I think you can tell that with the power of unity and AR foundation you can build some really cool stuff some really cool stuff please welcome Sarah Levantine as you've seen we've been building amazing features to help you take advantage of advancements in mobile hardware but we also understand that you want to maximize your player base which means broad range of device support games that can scale from the low end to the high end unlike PC or console building for mobile platforms requires a delicate balance I was a game developer myself in a past life so I get that one of the biggest challenges you face is building games to look beautiful and run smoothly but that don't overtax the hardware this is what happens to your framerate when your device is throttled it's super painful to deal with and really frustrating today there's a couple ways we can handle this problem on the one hand you can focus on just a small subset of devices at the high end the problem with that though is that it really limits your audience instead what most developers end up doing is pulling back on their game design sacrificing graphics fidelity lowering your target framerate reducing the scope of your game so they can still run well on lowend devices we don't want you to have to sacrifice we want to give you the control not the hardware through thermal management you can build games that run smoothly with sustained performance over longer periods of time we've built adaptive performance a new feature giving you unprecedented data about device thermal trends including information about whether your game is CPU or GPU bound at runtime the data this feature provides will enable you to adjust your game dynamically and proactively to best utilize the hardware the result is decreased thermal buildup a more predictable frame rate enabling a much better player experience and we tried this out with megacity the massive streaming world project you may have heard of the we unveiled last year with millions of entities built with scalability in mind this was the ideal testbed for our new performance feature by starting at lower CPU and GPU levels increasing them gradually to eliminate our bottlenecks we're able to keep energy consumption low if we detect we're getting narrow throttling state we can adjust the game right there to stabilize the temperature in our case we chose to lower the level of detail as you can see the results are impressive giving you the power to stabilize your framerate over extended time this simple was measured over 20 minutes which is already impressive but check this out we started up megacity left it running overnight came back in the morning and it was still humming along righted it's a target framerate it was amazing by keeping a closer eye on devices thermal trends we can adjust performance onthefly and avoid throttling altogether with this kind of dynamic adjustment we can find that balance between maximum quality maximum performance on a range of devices we're working with the world's largest Android device manufacturer to make this happen first on some of the most popular devices our partnership with Samsung will enable you to use adaptive performance on Galaxy devices like the new flagship Galaxy S 10 galaxy fold and coming soon to many existing Samsung devices already in players hands around the world and this is just the beginning we're going to continue to invest in adaptive performance adding new features and rolling out to even more devices this year and beyond please welcome Warren Spector hey everybody I'm Warren Spector I'm the creative director on System Shock 3 in case you haven't guessed by now I'm here to announce that the other side Austin team is building System Shock 3 with unity system shot games from a narrative standpoint are set in the world that's part cyberpunk a little bit space opera but more important to me is that from a gameplay standpoint we call them immersive simulations what that means is we merged a variety of genres which drives marketing guys crazy which I love anyway sister shock is part firstperson shooter part roleplaying game and part survival horror game but most important about the immersive simulations is the idea that they empower players to create their own stories to craft their own unique experiences in System Shock 3 we want players to feel alone in a strange and dangerous place a station on the outskirts of our solar system it's a world that was once alive with activity but is now controlled by a rogue AI named showdown living on this station or on living on this station are only robots mutants and the dead now with that in mind with that description having been said you can probably expect that there are some key things that we're trying to achieve fear feeling of horror feeling of dread we've got a bunch of gameplay systems in mind that we're absolutely not going to talk about today but from a visual standpoint we needed a setting that was kind of a new are like dominated by deep dark problematic disturbing shadows and punctuated by areas of intense focused light but that's about all I can say right now in a minute we're gonna have Elizabeth Liu grow and Lucas come back out here and tell you how we achieved that look but for now let's take the first ever sneak peek at System Shock 3 in its current prealpha state and everything you do all right we are gonna switch gears away from mobile on to desktop and away from the lightweight render pipeline on to our highdefinition render pipeline Elizabeth you are the graphics programmer on System Shock right yeah that's right show us some of your favorite shots well so I really love this shot here and you can see in this shot we have Steve in one of our vacuum sealed body bags pretty gnarly scene but one thing that this really highlights is HDR piece unified lighting model what that essentially means is we don't have to fake all these kind of special edge cases for light so for instance on this body bag here you'll see we're getting this awesome specular reaction and if I take this light here and I actually move it down you'll see we're even getting the subsurface through that vacuum bag is that like a custom shader you have to do know so that's the builtin HD RP materials HD lit shaders can we mess around with that a little bit yeah so I can remove the base map here I can make this a little bit more red I can turn down the Alpha all of it's just working dynamically I love that shot I love that time the what else you got so because we're using a sharpie and the unified lighting model we also get volumetric lights which are super cool and kind of that the same Steve yes that is the same Steve for Beth Dale and one thing that's really great about this is as I turn up this light here you'll notice we're getting brighter volumetrics as well as getting an increased subsurface response here on the volumetrics that's like the sort of dust in the air right in front of the light right and then we and then you also see like his feet light up right yeah so that's the unified parts that all these sort of lighting features work together right so what's really cool about that is we didn't have to create a special kind of edge case light here it's doing kind of a fake effect or have to kind of tweak the shader here for Steve to make it respond better it all just worked kind of out in the bag hey before the show we were talking about decals and how you use them extensively yeah can you show us those so we use decals in the number of different ways just to kind of highlight how much they're doing here let me go ahead and turn them off and on so you can see they're doing a lot gotcha so we're using projection decals kind of for these splashes of color like the blood here as well as the yellow stripes here and then we're using mesh decals to really add a lot of detail to the scene what's going on with that decal on the right there where like changes how the how the light hits the floor right so one of the great things about deferred decals is we can really change the underlying geometry so right there we're changing the metalness of the floor here we're changing the normals diffuse and just really kind of bringing out a lot of added detail that we normally couldn't do gotcha hey we've seen both fronts and Jed use shader graph 2 for some custom material work on their lightweight render pipeline games has shader graph been any help on this HDR peeve title yeah so in that scene you might have seen we were actually using shader graph here to kind of animate these vertex positions and kind of give this this there's no mesh animation here this whole thing is driven purely by the material right so I can modify this around a little bit I can change the speed here and I can really just kind of start to fiddle around with what what does the graph look like for a shooter like that I like this oh it kind of looks like the monster yeah yeah so we're you know getting a lot of use out of that Wow I think it looks really great and I think this is great to have an example like this of the kind of graphics quality that the HDR peopIe plan can bring through a title so thanks a lot of Lizabeth thank you so much please welcome Lauren laning hi everybody it's great to be here today and we're showing a glimpse of oddworld soul storm it's a brand new game in the out world series an insole storm we wanted to break new ground big visual and cinematic leaps were important to us and so as a storyteller I need to stay focused on the things that bring that narrative to life and in this case this is where unities breath of realtime lighting and technologies and the amazing teams working with us around the world are making this possible so today we're showing you a sneak peek of a cinematic from the game that demonstrates some of unities latest rendering techniques then when that's done Benny Thierry executive producing partner on the project is going to show you how unity has elevated the graphical quality of oddworld soul storm thank now I think you need to see this hello everyone it's an honor to be here with you today building our cinematics is a global endeavor through unity our teams of talented creatives and engineers are collaborating in real time when you are as distributed in unity as we are the tools are a critical component and how we produce economy CG unity provides a sandbox of powerful cinematic tools to choreograph the narrative and polish our visuals called timeline and post process stack in our scene breakdown the process starts simple but very quickly grows in complexity in engine parallel workflow is the key to reducing production costs and increasing the quality of CG that we produce instead of waiting hours to render our iteration speed from review to direct an approval happens in real time for oddworld the richness and our visuals and imagery imagery is very important to us as creatives when we started Sol storm three years ago the team focused on how far we could elevate that bar utilizing the built in renderer which is still used in many components of our production today our characters like the shaman have significantly improved since their last IP new and tasty as a team we aspire to reach further built in rendering while great wasn't designed for the types of heavy graphical complexity and realism that our creative director had envisioned for the cinematics the team wanted more control to refine the visuals and give the shaman that stylized odd world look high definition rendering pipeline in unity 2019 is a huge leap in graphical realism and ease of use and our split screen tests the differences are immediately apparent the shaman doesn't feel so flat and washed out the way light behaves while interacting with the shaman skin and features is more physically accurate we're able to color grade the image in engine and in realtime which gives our visual a more cinematic right outofthebox look but light doesn't just touch the surface it goes deeper right scattering before it returned back to your eye HD rp+ subsurface scattering was the solution that we gave for the shaman to give that rich oddworld style we explored these opportunities to make our characters feel like they were a part of you the work that unity is done to mature its rendering technology is outstanding please follow us at audible.com thank you so much we are very hard at work at our data oriented technology stack it consists of the csharp job system that we shipped last year the burst compiler and the entity component system now the most unconventional piece of that stack is definitely the burst compiler because it takes csharp code and turns it into assembly code now you wouldn't quite think that she sharp would be the most obvious choice to write the lowlevel parts of your game engine in but what makes burst work is that we don't use all of the features of csharp we take out things like the garbage collector like reflection and we don't allow any virtual calls in your job code and what burst does is it takes programs written in that subset of csharp and turns it into a highly optimized assembly code take a look here this is an image of the burst inspector I love everything about this image I do I love the verse inspector here on the left is a list of all the jobs in this project I selected my simple calling job a calling job that is the inner loop of our calling code of the renderer if calling is not fast we could all go home it has to be fast and here on the right side you see the machine instructions that the burst compiler generated interleaved with the original she sharp code the source code of that job so if you're the kind of developer that really wants to get down to the metal and really understand exactly what is going on you want to understand what the compiler does why it does it and you want to verify if it did a good job no pun intended you can take a look here and you can see that it actually did do a good job these specific machine instructions they're vectorized so they operate on for calling planes at the same time the burst compiler is going out of preview with unity 20 19.1 and we have a burst one that'll release candidates available for you today now before you all run out and go download it I see a few people hanging onto their sheet we're gonna have the person who started this whole data oriented tech stack initiative at unity we're gonna have him take it for a spin here we go well my name is Jeff him and my relate well well I founded it together with two other guys I knew I wants to make computer games I didn't really pay that much attention to high school that was not that was not what my parents wanted for me for sure back in the day most game engines were just so like a bunch of source code that you had to compile in and you could make a game out of it there wasn't really that many good options back there we basically said okay we want to eventually ship game engine a tool with which you can make computer games the reason we want to rep is because it felt like what we had actually built to make these these types of games was actually really flexible and really easy to use and we just wanted to make something that's really affordable so that you know like for people that that were like us we build unity on on that collaboration with those customers making a game is is hot it's hard work I really want to see this transition to to making unity the absolute most performant engine and enabling people to make games that have amazing performance that look beautiful but making it easy to do that dream version of unity is that we stick to our values it's just about being there for our community that we always listen to what they need and then build exactly dad thanks for I just really love making game engines I'm having just a blast these days actually just doing that so and see why not thank you a couple months ago at unite we showed the megacity demo and it's been really important for us to stress test the data our enter text stack proving that we can stream simulate and render massive amounts of content in a dynamic world let's check it out so today we're releasing the megacity project let's see what is included gonna go to a editor demo so I'm gonna I'm just going to open up the megacity scene here so we can check it out and in this scene we have four point five million renderers and they're all getting loaded in the background in the editor and that's of course important because we love great runtime performance but it's equally important that workflows are efficient when you're working particularly in such big scenes check out all of this detail here that we have just hanging around everywhere in the megacity and all of these buildings every single one is made of around 200,000 separate entities you can really see how crazy that looks when just flying up these buildings because their detail is just not on the level of the camera it's just everywhere now when I click on that building I can select it and I can just click on edit here when I do that I can use the sub scene feature to get back to a very familiar object representation here we have our game object I can move them around I have my transform component my lot groups my modern behavior I can move them around and change whatever I like and I can do that in the context of the whole world and then I can select some of these shacks and the megacity the building block of it is really these nested prefabs you can see here this this prefab of these shacks it is made out of further smaller pieces and different variants put together and that was really important first actually be able to build this kind of scene with this massive of content because we we had two artists working on it for just a couple of weeks now when I'm done editing I can just close the scene I can save it and what you see then is we are saving the scene to disk the game objects but we're also saving the entity optimized representation and we can actually load and unload the different parts these different sections so here you can see the low resolution detail with just a couple of renders just representing the shell of the building but then when I load the rest of the scene in I can I can do that for streaming just getting more detail when I'm close up and in the distance you have to shell but look at how fast add loads that is the power of a runtime ready data format now everything that you have just seen including the content the game code and the tools is available today so with the data into text second we want to empower you to create the most rich interactive and dynamic worlds and to do that you need physics so we decided to partner with a company that has defined the gold standard in physics simulation for games and for the last couple of couple of months we had an amazing collaboration with the havoc team and so I'd like to welcome all of our strong from havoc on stage Hey I'm super happy to be here Veon havoc always have been impressed by the creativity of the unity games and VI excited to show how unity and havoc have worked together to push physics to the next level and there is a couple things that we wanted to achieve together we want to give control of the physics simulation back to the developer something that is fast easy to understand and easy to modify actually events were very similar experience in havoc our first engine is an objectoriented approach but after years of painful iterations we ended up with some data centric approach very similar to dots and our users laughed it they found that removing those extra abstractions made it easier to understand and that gave them the control they needed indeed our collaboration with unity we were able to take that experience and create a data protocol in csharp which describes physics in a clean and simple way and we want unity to become the best game engine for creating Network games and in our experience physics is often what makes or breaks a network game so we worked with the have team on designing physics specifically for networking yeah network games are already quite complex so the key here is reducing complexity the tent design goal in mind we created something which is lightweight doesn't require internal caches and is easy to understand and we call that unity physics it is written completely in sushar using the burst compiler and csharp jobs so specifically for performance how did that actually work out for you I mean Rhian Heric are obsessed by performance and using the burst compiler was actually a great experience it was easy to use we didn't have to write platformspecific code and moody threading just worked out of the box and we did a very detailed analysis of the burst compiler output and we were surprised to find that it actually matches hand optimized assembly and this is super important because it allows us to write highperformance code in the same language as a game logic and for me personally that this is possible it's just absolutely amazing just incredible now unity games use physics for all kinds of different purposes and so in some cases a lightweight and stateless physics engine is not the right fit but fortunately for the last 20 years that havoc team has built and finetuned a sophisticated physics engine and its performance and quality powers the most ambitious Triple A games so we also want to offer that full power of Havok physics inside of unity and the data centric approach was key to making this possible it made a trivial to integrate havok physic's so with a simple switch you can go from unity physics simulation to havoc engine and because the data protocol is the same you user content can stay the same even your scripting logic so you talk a lot so now check out a new unit of physics written in csharp in axial live demo so you are him please so what any physics engine needs is collision parameters so we started with spheres boxes and capsules capsules are needed for rectals but from the very start we also wanted to include convex meshes comics meshes are important because it allows the artist to take a graphical mesh and just wrote into the physics engine without authoring specialized physics proxies and every physics engine also needs physics materials so we have this kind of iron object which has a very low friction so you see you are him kind of slides that a heavy iron object over the floor like it would be is another physics material property bounciness so we created those tires and very happily bounce around in a scene so yeah him stop having fun you have to move to the next theme alright ok so the next section here we have to have a board and this hoverboard is really driven by a bunch of game code and you can see when I pick it up here underneath it there's a bunch of queries there's these ray casts and they are what makes it have a board actually hover above the ground and so it's super important in a physics engine to have really efficient queries and shape casts and so on and the physics and havoc team spend a lot of time optimizing that code to be really really fast and then another set of features in the physics engine we call constraints constraints are holding to gated bodies together in this case we created a row fridge out of hinge constraint so as it x actually behaves quite naturally and those constraints are used for a number of reasons you can do platforms in game build machines they actually use it for ragdolls or even simple giggles so the next feature is also interesting we call it trigger volumes the shiny cylinders actually a rigidbody but instead of colliding it changes the material property of the object in this case the gravity so if this kind of slider which allows us to control the gravity form positive to be negative in the course is throwing as robots up and down they're getting dirty so if they get dirty we need to wash them so we have so we have this kind of nice little washing machine actually what it is we call it robot testing facility because we can stress test our physics engine so you see all kind of features here coming together we have constrained system your spheres we have balls different materials even though rotating mesh and that allows us to see the stuff scalable or the behavior it's just actually a lot of fun playing with this stuff so it's really amazing seeing all of this come together and this is all written with the C sharp Unity physics engine and the best part is this unity physics physics engine is available as a preview package today and havok physic's will be available later in the summer and together this is a complete physics solution for creating rich and interactive worlds for dots thank you please welcome Natalia to torture in the past few years at Unity we focus a lot of investment in graphics resulting in exponential leap forward in rendering quality and we're just starting to build momentum we're future proofing our technology through a combination of partners talent and innovation we work closely with partners to bring you the best and latest workflows like substance I told uniformly loved by artists but today is available in beta on the asset store and that is coming out of beta in spring substance and unity will support HD and lightweight scriptable render pipelines was simple intuitive workflows for both of the pipeline's as well as the shader graph and you'll be able to easily live added substance material parameters for realtime texture updates whether you are any editor or at runtime for quick artist workflows and many thanks to the substance team for all of their hard work on this this is what a lot of artists have been craving to get at unity will also invest in people this includes hiring the best to help you achieve your aspirations the unity graphics team is full of worldclass talent I'm lucky to work with them on the architecture of our workflows and rendering pipelines but today I'm happy to welcome graphene to the Unity family graffia pioneers virtual texturing inefficient texture streaming and with everincreasing device resolution and complexity of scenes that is rising steeply we need higher density textures and more of them more than ever now and graphene will help us boost our architecture and provide bestinclass artist workflows for comprehensive virtual texture streaming welcome graphene mauve graphics innovation comes from our extensible and configurable script Ola render pipeline architecture as well as our artists workflows we want to make sure to give you the right tools for the right job last year we harness the power of realtime ray tracing for accelerating lighting workflows through a real time path tracer to be lighting with our GPU progressive light mapper which is now available in preview but this is just the beginning of our realtime ray tracing journey we needed to make amazing offline quality professional graphics accessible to all of our users in real time frame rates so that they could take full advantage of the ray tracing technology and with realtime ray tracing interactive graphics which is new levels of realism which allows for truly dynamic global rendering effects possible at realistic game level fast frame rates let's take a look at what our realtime ray tracing technology can accomplish invent yourself and then reinvent yourself don't you swim in the same Slough invent yourself and then reinvent yourself and stay out of the clutches of mediocrity yourself and then reinvent yourself change your tone handshape so often that so they can never categorize you big array to yourself I'd accept what is which only that you have invented we selftaught every invent your life because you must and its history and the present I'd say this looks pretty sweet this was a huge accomplishment done in partnership with Nvidia BMW light and shadows and many groups at unity truly this was an effort where we were in it together Montreal Copenhagen Paris Detroit Seattle and San Francisco but what did you just see a beautiful car yeah there are 22 sequences in this video in total half of them are filmed on location with a realworld car and half of them are a CG vehicle yeah what's the big deal car commercials these days pretty much everybody around their stuff in CG yes but they take a couple of hours per frame to do that this CG car in the video is rendered in unity in 4k and interactive frame rates using the power of realtime ray tracing in HD RP on NVIDIA rtx GPU and in several of the shots the CG car is seamlessly transitioned to the live film car do you know which one is real it's pretty hard to tell and that's exactly the point I'll tell you a funny story so we're working on a demo and we were providing feedback on the shots to keep improving I put together a set of notes on a particular shot and Danny one of the artists on the team who was working on demo very gently pointed out that that specific shot was in fact film well there's not much we're gonna change about that in many of the shots the CG objects are flawlessly integrated in the complex realworld scenes with objects people lighting environment now we want to take a deeper look under the hood at what's happening in this VFX sequence and to do that I'm going to invite Natalie Burke lead technical artist to help me hey everyone in the highdefinition render pipeline we are already performing physically accurate computations for lighting and shadowing but in a rasterization world we operate on small local parts of the scene these are clever approximation the screen space approaches that run fast on console hardware but a trained eye can easily spot when the techniques break down when they don't match reality and if you don't see the object in the frame you won't see the results of that object the reflections on the screen yeah where are the wheels SSR to get goodlooking results with rasterization technique you often have to do very complicated shot specific setup and making these work reliably across camera changes dynamic world is really hard with ray tracing however it operates on the whole scene with you lighting and shadowing globally for far more accurate rendering do you see the wheel reflections now that yeah I do and you can see when I toggle this button on and off that the reflections are much more clear when we're using ray tracing and that's precisely the point of course this means you might need to consider it in your game or in your in production but now everything is present the content is easy to set up it just works and it's far more robust for camera changes or any other dynamic elements you truly get accurate global reflections or full scene lighting bounce and it doesn't matter if something is or is not visible in the frame you still get to see its impact its reflection shadows whatever it is and we give you ability with our solution to render primary race either with rasterization for best performance or retracing for highest quality like it with a full path tracer and with that you can get proper refractions from multilayer transparent materials you can kind of see some of us here or dynamic shadows that are globally accounting for the whole environment or really robust occlusion we're now in a global space where all there and you also get the full gamut of HD materials to play with opaque transparent alpha tests a double sided with full shader graph support so the artists are free to create more and of course dynamic realtime global illumination is a key part of delivering a fully ray tracing have ready solution let's look at the lighting now our retracing tech is built on top of each DRP in csharp scripts and shaders which is quick to reload and iterate in fact it took us about a day to build our global ambient occlusion solution it was that easy we provide a wide variety of ray traced effects for you to play with but if you wanted to create your own with a hybrid HDR P you get the full access to all of the runtime resources and you can choose between rasterization or ray tracing at any time object camera material as you wish you are in a driver seat nice you get great shadows from all of the objects in the scene from these huge textured area lights like the screen that you see here this is something that is tremendously difficult to do with rasterization despite all the research that's happening in this domain oh and this is running at game rate rates on a single consumer Invidia GPU pushing rate racing at about 13 Pollock million polygons scene with all of these huge textured lights and GI and occlusion and shadows and textures and so forth on a mobile form factor as you can see realtime ray tracing is pretty damn exciting but it needs to be done right and what I mean by that is this high fidelity content is really the biggest bottleneck for creating and for graphics today creating it as hard it's timeconsuming without retracing solution we want to empower artists to create content once and use it both for raster and raytracing for a truly scalable solution and this is actually easy using the shader graph technology because ray tracing becomes an LOD and when we're on a restoration we use the regular shader and on retracing we use that best quality at best performance automatically and because our solution is built on a hybrid rendering pipeline this doesn't require any edge case it's a special case it's easy best of all we're delivering production focus ray tracing with a full preview coming in HD RP in fall 2019 this will include an early preview of a full frame path tracer even better you can start playing with our experimental HDR P build on github on April 4th experiment away please welcome Sylvia Rossi Bob you've known the work of unity is demo team for several years we are usually here to tell you all about the different ways in which we have improved and customized and extended various graphics features of unity all in the pursuit of making them better but this time our production feels very different from before it now feels that unity is already giving us a solid foundation that we can comfortably rely on and that made us confident enough to take upon some new challenges and some more unconventional subject matter we have had our graphics programmers unleash their imagination and work on creating essential elements of our storytelling it feels more and more like we can afford to experiment and to try new things with unities high definition run the pipeline and the new generation of posteffects we now have a fully featured production already working environment and we don't have to worry about visual quality because it just comes out of the box artists don't even need to have a deep understanding of what exactly is happening under the hood but there is a lot going on that contributes to the visuals being what they are and Natasha will be back to break it down for you afterwards but for now let me give you a glimpse into the new story that we're working on this build was just made an hour ago and I hope it works bear with me because it will play in real time thank you go take a look yeah okay here we go so exactly this guy you're kidding they're a fairy tale Buster don't be an idiot I see open it wait do it I can't believe this place is actually real this makes no sense to me Boston but he might have me right I gotta be honest with you I get chills watching this especially here now Sylvie just said this was hot off the presses she wasn't lying so we're gonna try something a little nuts I'll tell you I'm a little antsy about it since the demo just finished we're gonna try to go and break it down and look what's happening under the hood in the editor a little so what I deeply love about unities demo team truly is that they're always pushing the frontiers of realtime graphics for the industry at large not just about what's happening with graphics at Unity and in fact some of you who know me well know that one of the reasons I joined unity is for the chance to work together with a creative team that is our demo team now sometimes I'm always awed by their vision but sometimes they come to me and discuss where they want to push their ambition and they Blanche like really they tell me what they want to push and together we work we push the graphics on our end they push the specific effects and as a result we're really living it together you know together as a true production this was a perfect example of that so for me it was a tremendously exciting to hear that they're finally feeling free to focus on all the special cases the magic for their creative vision and leading creators do their thing truly is what I came to unity for now The Heretic is not only packed to the brim with a ton of graphics features from HD and many bespoke effects it's a visually gripping experience that is actually running steady 30fps on a consumergrade offtheshelf gamer PC and that's possible because of the latest optimizations across the board for the HD graphics features such as heavily tuned volumetric slots of VG PR magic there optimized from scratch ADHD postprocessing stack fast realtime area lights and so much more and the team relied on a visual effects graph to create abundant volumetric ambience constructing compelling atmosphere with detailed visual effects and now the fast performance of GPU particles in the VFX is what allowed them to amp up the richness of their scenes while maintaining solid framerate and it was easy for the team to create this with a powerful art excentric tool lighting is at the core of visual storytelling with well crafts like crafted lights you create suspense or you can diffuse a tense situation yet often complex lighting takes hours to create long baking steps can make any story iteration tenuous with HDR P performance rich and high quality lighting types for the first time the demo team was able to express their creative vision for this particular experience for a complex cinematic quality world entirely with realtime lights now light layers enabled a lot of custom setup for key parts of the scene for example like lighting the main character or putting particles and separate layers enabling cinematic control for the creators this is actually how liveaction films are made HD lights in particular are physically based with realworld units what this means is it allows artists to use their experience from real world to guide the lighting setup you know the light bulbs you know the Sun and you don't have to translate your exposure units into arcane units it just works with highly detailed contact shadows we're able to pick up a lot of micro details of complex surfaces that's what allows us to actually have the eyelashes cast proper shadows on the face in the performant manner that's something that's really hard otherwise and all of this came with really fast iteration for artists they maintain their high visual lebar expectations and still they were able to achieve stellar runtime performance the HD pipeline also gave the demo team a lot of Legos to build the digital humans appearance all of the organic materials for skin hair fabrics are available as HD masternodes and a shader graph the dama team took them push them to 11 and really customize the heck out of them to create a truly realistic human the cinematographers lens directs our attention it drives the viewer focus in the camera properties can intensify our emotions or with a focal length change can rapidly build a sense of surprise in film this is controlled entirely through actual physical properties of the lens itself with the new HD postprocessing stack vests the creative director of The Heretic achieved the filmic look by deep use of physical camera that's fully supported with a new HD post tag in this stack is the next level revolution for postprocessing its unity upgrade it rewritten from scratch from maximal integration with HDR P for example the new HD bloom effect is fully energy conserving with a much more natural look it's stable for all ranges of values and it's also aided by pre exposition to help with high physical values it also supports a wide range of scene exposures what does that mean that means that for creator they don't longer have to fight with sudden overblown hot spots from bloom it behaves consistently and predictably personally I'm actually really excited about our new algorithm for depth of field some of you who've seen the graphics updates or jar of Awesome as I call it probably have seen this excitement for me this algorithm uses resolution independent scalable parametric bouquet shape with proper aperture control it accurately supports anamorphisms it also recreates the cat eye effect of the camera which occurs when a light enters camera at an angle now these physical imperfections they bring completely new level of naturalness to the resulting frame and for me that actually truly makes the felt the the frame feels cinematic but that's not all of course the HD postdoc includes a completely new motion blur far better quality faster performance wider and more precise blurs and also no halo artifacts there is a new film grain for HD that makes you really feel like a perfect cinematic grain quality and there's a really good reason for it because we relied in a high resolution reference grain but artists can't eek scanning the grains and make it their own now there's one more component to HD postprocessing stack that I personally find very handy it's the panini projection which is a mathematical rule for constructing perspective for very wide fields of view it's not named after sandwich it is in fact named in honor of John Paul a panini an 18th century Roman painter and a professor of perspective this obscure mathematical formula integrated to the new HD Poe stack enables creators to work with a wide variety of display form factors you set it up in a minute and it doesn't matter if you display it on a 16 by 9 on a phone screen or on an ultra wide display at a keynote it just works and I want to thank again to the amazing demo team to interpret introducing us to this beautiful world of The Heretic and I also want to thank Nathalie that's a wrap for our show tonight we covered a lot of ground from demonstrating why unity is the platform for mobile game developers to showing you how much progress we've made with performance and graphics and we look forward to launching 2019 dot one with you this spring thank you and of course have a fantastic GDC I was back oh my goodness what did you think of that Liz what what to end on like The Heretic is just insane and I get chills every time I see it like we've seen bits internally and now that it's done veiled we've had it spoiled but you just got it for the first time you're amazing thank you I can't help but feel that maybe we've sport people a little bit too much tonight with with with too much unity goodness oh one thing sorry that I will say is the heretic is on the booth so heretic and ECS is on the booth we're going to be demoing it if you want to see this more indepth come we can't wait to show you yeah and also the the raytracing demo the BMW thing I think we made the same mistake I thought the other car was the specular was superhigh I was like that's the fake one no you go to unity 3d comm slash ray tracing you can check out that demo properly and get really indepth with it I think that's on the booth as well I'm not entirely sure it might be but you can also check out the heretic you can watch it again on youtube keep watching it back keep seeing all those tiny amazing details what else did you enjoy tonight this it was great to see so many titles using lightweight render pipelines laughs that was awesome I loved the aerial water shader effect yeah and like the usability of it to create other kind of systems and that's yeah I'm looking forward to playing around with the whole nested sub crafting I really love to a our foundation as well audience interaction and don't forget Jo said maybe you should watch the Google keynote tomorrow go and check out and I am they're unveiling things we can't talk about but it's really cool yeah subscribe to our YouTube channel keep watching us keep tracking us and you'll see a whole lot of this stuff everything from GDC will be there and you'll get it all first so thank you thank you indeed thank you all for watching we'll see you next time at unite in September and Copenhagen but for now good night have a great GDC right
