hello everyone welcome to the eleventh tutorial in our survival game series done by practice I am the CEO of Brack ease and I just got back from skiing ready to do some more tutorial stuff today we are taking a look at how to switch weapons in unity so we are going to be scripting bats so as always I have already opened up the unity and so I have opened up unity and first of all I just want to get rid of the ground plane object in our scene because that we won't need anymore now that we have such a fine terrain alright so basically what we're going to do and we are going to open up the player prefab and under the main camera will find our melee empty game object which is start currently starring our maze and our sort objects so basically you want to put both weapons in there the weapons that you're going to be switching between and the one that you want the character to start out with that one you're just going to leave enabled the other one you're just going to disable and make sure that they are correctly positioned and lined up with the cameras or anything looks good alright so I'll go ahead and disable the sword again so I want the character to start out out with having the mace equipped and for now maybe we'll take a look at how to make animations that switch between the two maybe not depends on how much time this is going to take but okay let's go ahead and create the script so you go ahead and select the melee empty game object you click Add component new script and of course you're going to program this in JavaScript and by the way a lot of people have asked me why we are starting out with the JavaScript well basically I think that JavaScript is a little easier learn in the future we might do some csharp programming in general csharp is a lot broader of a programming language but for beginners JavaScript can do exactly what you need so we'll just call this weapon switching you know what will D capitalize that so weapon switching create an ad and open it up in monodevelop perfect okay so we can go ahead and delete the function start we won't be needing that and let's start out by creating some variables okay so it has been some a little wider since we created our last script so might be a little rusty but as always we'll start with the variables and we'll call the first one bar and then weapon one so I'll capitalize that and Sue a one a colon and then it's going to be a type game object next one is we are going to do the exact same we call this just going to call this weapon two and again a type game object all right so this is the variables that are going to store our two weapons so in our function update we want to call the weapon switching when something happens more specifically we want to check if we get an input and you can make this whatever you want I'm just going to say if input dot get key down and then I'm going to do a key code so key code dot capital Q so we're going to switch weapons using the Q key then we want something to happen so we want to swap our weapons and you could exclude them but I'm just going to go ahead and make the brackets also after all that is our name so it should look like this and whenever you see a piece of code just do this so a name and then just the the the end the ending signs it means you're calling a function so parenthesis start and end and then a semicolon means function so we are going to go ahead and have to create the function so we'll make a new function call it swap weapons and it's a good idea to always create functions with capital letters all the way through so I'm swap weapons and the parentheses I'm going to leave them empty and then we're going to start the bracket and of course end it also ropes it up Tibor there you go and inside of here we're going to check if the weapon 1 dot active this equal to true and if that do this alright so on what we have here is we have a piece of code starring two game objects these two weapons we have a function update checking if the player presses the Q key code the Q key on this keyboard and if he does then just call this function swap weapons once this function will check if the weapon one is active so the first that weapon is currently equipped and if it is we're going to switch to the second weapon so the code is going to look like this weapon 1 dot set active recursively it's going to be false in parentheses semicolon and weapon 2 dot set active recursively it's going to be true in parenthesis so let's simply make sure that if the weapon 1 is currently equipped then it will equip weapon 2 instead and disable the weapon 1 now we want to make the opposite case so we go down until the closing bracket of the if statement and type else so else is called if if the if statement doesn't meet its requirements so if the weapon sir one isn't active then it's going to do whatever we put inside of the else statement so Elle's weapon 1 dot set active recursively it's going to be true and yes you guessed it weapon 2 that's set active recursively is this time going to be false and this way we can simply switch between our two weapons so let's go ahead and try it out open unity back up you can see that the two variables need to have something stored in them so we can drag our mace under the weapon one another sort under the weapon I'll go ahead and maximize and hit play and when I click the cue it switches to my sword I'm going to click it again it switches back to my mace this way this is pretty much the simplest way to do weapon switching I guess if I have to do the animations also this would take too long so I'll go ahead and cut off the video right here but I heard I hope you learn something from it and I'll see you in the next video you
