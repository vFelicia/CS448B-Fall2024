hello everyone so here's a brand new asset pack available at dev assets calm the western props back by dark Ellen that's with everything else on the site it's pay what you want we've been working super hard to get everything just right so that you guys will choose to support the project after all we are counting solely on your support so you can of course just go grab the pack from the link in the description and set it up yourselves but he isn't sure to turn how to get everything working in unity in case you're in doubt so so download the assets just go to dev assets comm and you can see it's pretty much here on the front page so let's just go ahead and click on that image you can check out some of the screenshots here and when you're ready to download simply select the price that you can afford and go ahead and hit the blue button it's going to download at the zip file that we can just double click it's going to open up and we can see this weapon props pack folder we can just drag that to any location on the computer and it's going to unzip it then we can open up the western props pack folder inside is a readme a models folder and a western props unity package if you're not using unity you can go ahead and grab all the models and textures inside of the models folder everything is neatly organized if you are using unity however I really recommend just double clicking on the western props unity package as you can see I have an empty unity project already open so when we doubleclick it it's just going to start importing so click import wait for unity to load everything in and a Western props pack should now appear in your project panel so let's expand that and double click on the example scene and we can see just how easy it was to get all these awesome looking models working inside of unity this is rendered without any effects on the camera just plain models so if we now want to bring one of these props into our game we can simply go to the prefabs folder select the one we'd like I'm just going to go ahead and take the wooden barrel here and rub it into your scene notice how every single model uses the standard shader and has both an ax B Doe a metallic a normal map and an occlusion map it's pretty much tailored to work with unity right at the gate and pretty much any other PBR workflow the amazing part about this is that we can easily change the mood of our scene and still have the models look awesome let's for example just take our directional light and disable it and all of a sudden we have a nicelooking nighttime scene and all of the models are rendering appropriately let's pretty much it for this video I will of course have a regular tutorial out on Sunday and until then I hope you will just enjoy going nuts with this pack so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video
