so I've been using unity for about six years now and I've only recently started to make good use of some of the editing extensions on the asset store a man do I feel dumb these assets have already saved me so much time and I honestly don't know why it took me so long to start using them so I've made a list of my favorite editing extensions to help you guys avoid making the same mistake the first asset on the list is editor console Pro in the console Pro is a powerful replacement for the standard console window you can group together messages you can assign colors and icons and even preview the source code surrounding each method call in the stack but most importantly you can now search for entries and hide the ones that you don't want to see finally no more going through scripts to comment out debug box a the console Pro is paid but in my opinion it is super worth it next it's a free asset called do tween I've tried a few different tweening engines from the store but I definitely think two tween is the most easy and stable do tween allows you to easily add cool animations to your game objects and UI elements I must use it to spice up my UI with some fancy animation deuteron also has a pro version which adds a visual path and animation editor a 3rd asset is for those of you who aren't too excited about programming in csharp luckily for you playmaker is a powerful visual scripting solution it allows artists designers and also programmers to create advanced logic within a nodebased editor this asset is paid but if you're looking for a way to make games without writing code playmaker is really great now a common issue when making games for mobile is setting up some good onscreen controls CN controls is a free asset that helps you do exactly that the package contains a bunch of different controls from joystick to dpad and it allows you to customize the controls to suit the look of your game and the best part is it's free and now the final asset on the list the amplifi shader editor this asset allows you to create shaders using a visual node editor some of the coolest effects I've seen this year have been made using this asset it's easy to use and it comes with a bunch of examples to help you get started it is paid on the story but if you're serious about graphics I definitely recommend picking this up and that's pretty much my list of top editor extensions I've created a list on the asset store which contains all them as well as a few ones that I could squeeze into the video one of them is final I K which definitely deserves a mention so in the description to check them out now there are a few great assets that I haven't included like CRO builder text mesh and Odin but that's because I've already mentioned them in my list of alltime favorite assets if you want you can check out that video as well feel free to share your personal list of assets in the comments but let me know if there's another category that you'd like to see next also I'm sorry that I didn't put out a video this Wednesday unfortunately I got sick but I'm feeling better and we're back to schedule as usual on that thanks watching and I will see you in the next video thanks all of the awesome patreon supporters who donated in September and especially thanks to Judah Minh hats off to Derek James Kirk face lemare 5zg Bali yes for Mickelson James P Thomas volley Superman the great Sybok mummy Jason Lotito Aaron Robert Boone and Nick Lang if you want to become a pitcher in yourself you can do so at patreon.com slash brackets you guys Rock
