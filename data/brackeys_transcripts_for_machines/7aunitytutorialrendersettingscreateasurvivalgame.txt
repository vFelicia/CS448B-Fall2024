hello everyone and welcome to the seventh tutorial in our survival game series done by Black Keys I am the CEO of Rockies and today we are going to take a look at something very exciting we are going to take a look at something called particle systems and these can make spells and magical effects and explosions and fire look so damn cool and we also going to take a look at something a little more practical which is render settings okay so if we go ahead and open up a unity I've already done this this scene is exactly as we left it this time which is also why I want to make some quick changes so first of all I just want to delete all of these animations these animations were for my last my previous maze and not for the new mine and that I made so I'm going to delete these and just drag the new animation I made in to that folder at some point I will do these animations again okay um and I also want to make a new folder called GUI and just drag the crosshair in there and yes this should pretty much get us started yes also I want to drag this maze and this sword out into the assets so if we go back here we can now see that the two prefabs store here so I want to rightclick and again make a new folder called prefabs I suggest that you do this it's a good way to organize everything you could also make subfolders like weapons and stuff but I won't do this until it gets clouded with everything and also I have forgotten to click on the sword and then remove the animator component oh I can see that the maze that I have here in my prefab it's not actually a prefab it's just an import so I'll go ahead and drag this back into our input folder and then just select the maze and I'm my scene and then drag this down so we have that as a preset I'm prefab sorry okay so first of all let's go ahead and change the settings this is the boring part although this can change a lot so go to the edit button above and go down to render settings and in here you can do stuff like farc and ambient light these two are the most important settings so what farc is is basically it will blur out objects in the distance with a certain color so if i just go ahead and quickly make some objects and drag them out into the distance and put a light over them so that we can see what they actually are so you can see them there and I'll just maximize the game view a little bit so if we go ahead under the render settings again and then enable the FAC you can see that they get blurred with a greyish color while nothing happens to the foreground and so you can adjust this color you could make it red issue some orange if you are in a desert you could make it light bluish if you are close to the sky or in a snowy environment you could make it darker if you were making a horror game and so you can play around with this this can add a cool depth without putting too much pressure on the graphics card in processor so um but for now I'll just keep this disabled I just wanted to give you the do you the opportunity and once we start creating our landscape then I will reenable this probably um ambient light and this is something that I had people ask me because they say oh I want to make a room that is completely dark except for the one light that I have and I can't do that and why is that this is because of the ambient light so right now you can see that this is just this is set to a greyish dark gray color and so this is the darkest color that can be shown in your scene so even if you don't have any lights this is set so if you want to make a horror game I recommend that you drag this all the way down now you can see that all the parts of my scene that is unlit cats um or flown with this color so generally you don't want to have things that isn't lit at all you want some kind of lighting else every single piece of detail that you made will just disappear but for something like an adventure game or a survival game or a RPG you generally want things to be pretty well lit so for now we'll just keep this at the grayish color also okay so go up to edit and then project settings and then quality and this is actually what you also call from the render settings so you can see that we have the different levels this is just presets of settings that unity has set up for us and the green little Mark's here means that this is what the different platforms so this could be web the PC the Mac it could be iPhone and all these different platforms will use by default so first of all let's go ahead and say that this will be fantastic for all of them by simply using the smaller downward pointing arrows here and let me just get closer to Mike and so let's go ahead and click on the fantastic level and then let's crank up some of the settings so the pixel light count is basically how many lights you can see reflecting off one surface so if I add if just I just set this to 1 and then add a whole bunch of lights I'll just go ahead and delete the stuff I made in the background here so this was the duplicates like that and delete the line okay so if we make a whole bunch of lights and put in in different places on the surface you can't seem to be able to see any difference it might get lighter but as soon as we crank it up so practic settings quality and then change this to maybe 5 you can start to see specularity and also in the game view so this is basically how detailed you want the lighting to be and I think that we want the lighting to be a whole lot more detailed than just 4 because this actually doesn't take off that much power it's not even that heavy so let's just set this to 100 for now this is a heavy number and we won't be using that much it's just to set say don't cut it down texture quality definitely want this to be full rest this simply may make the textures you can simply make the textures look worse and therefore it take less power to render and and it's to drop pick textures you should leave this set forced on this is fine I won't explain what it actually does antialiasing antialiasing is is simply a smoothing of the edges so if we go ahead and disable this and you take a look at some of the edges here you can see that they are not so smooth again and if I crank this up to 8 they all the pixel errors just get completely cut off so you want this as high as possible but this is pretty heavy so for now we can just leave this as 4 because I'm recording meanwhile but generally the fantastic setting in a game should leave this at 8 but for now let's leave it at 4 no no you know what let's leave the fantastic level at 8 and then just test at the beautiful level that will create in a second so soft panicles you want this and you can play around the shadows though this only matters when you have unity Pro and this you can just leave alone so go under the beautiful and now just quickly type some things in so this will be 75 full rest forced on four times and serializing shadows distance will be let's say 100 and again for cascades and the good should be 50 and then hmm yes still full res per texture though antialiasing to soft particles still and the shadows look fine symbols should be about 25 and then full rest per texture disabled no soft particles and the shadows look fine fast should be a bout 10 full rest no and isotropic textures no enticing those soft particles we can still have some shadows maybe that's your call call and fast it's fast its fastest pixel I count five half rest no no now disable shadows and you'll be good to go alright so let's leave that this ad beautiful while we are testing so you can go ahead and save a ctrl s and go back to the assets folder and while we're all waste we have already spent 12 minutes so okay this is the ends of this part in the next part we'll cover the particles I'm sorry that I have to cut this up so thank you for watching
