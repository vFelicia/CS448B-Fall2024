hello one will come to the mastering Coalition tutorial done by practice I am the CEO of practice and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at the different aspects of coalition inside of unity and in game development in general and how you can achieve really nice physics and coalition effects without being too harsh on your computer so we're going to take a look at the different methods and yeah it's going to be awesome so for this tutorial I have prepared a lot of stuff I have switched my window layout to the wide because I want to show you a whole lot of stuff that I've set up so all right we here in my mastering collision scene and the first thing we are going to take a look at is this and this is basically just a half sphere which I have extruded out and a ball that should fall upon it let's say that we want to have a game mechanic where this ball simply falls into this half sphere well if we just simply take this half speed it's fear imported into unity and create a sphere which we then apply a rigidbody the effect will look something like this the sphere Falls but it doesn't collide with the half sphere so I'm if we take a look at what components are attached to the different objects I'll just zoom in on the sphere here this fear has a rigidbody component this means that it will interact with different objects in the scene and different laws of physics for example the gravity which we can enable and disable here there are also other settings like mass drag angular drag and some constraints which will lock the the positioning and rotation of the sphere in different axes we ain't going to go into too much detail with this since this is not a physics tutorial this is more of a collision so alright so we have the rigidbody attached and of course we also have the sphere Collider because if we disable this it will simply fold through everything it won't be able to collide with anything so the collider is what decides is its like the shape of the object that will collide and the rigidbody is what makes it actually interact in the physics space so once we have so this ball is actually working correctly those are something wrong with our health a half sphere and this is because we haven't attached a Collider if we go ahead and click the add component and then physics we can attach different colliders let's try with a box Collider this creates a box around a sphere let's go ahead and play the game let's drag out the game view so we can see both the scene and the game view the ball in deeds hits the house fear but it's it only rolls off the surface so this Collider simply isn't detailed enough I'll go ahead and disable this one because I've made a right version a working version and let's see what's different so if we go over here in the righthand side we can see that I have attached another kind of component this Collider is called a mesh Collider the mesh Collider will take the vertices from the real mesh which means the stuff you actually see in the scene and make a Collider of it this can be very taxing on your computer if you have many objects with mesh colliders and that if the objects are very detailed so this will get more and more advanced for the computer to calculate with more the more vertices you have but this is a way to actually achieve the kind of collision we have here so let's go ahead and hit play and see if it works the ball collides and it rolls into this century of our sphere just like it would in real life so that's basically how you would do complex collision in a moment we'll also take a look at how to achieve somewhat the same effect but making it a lot less taxing on the computer there's one more way to do this instead of just hitting the add component than physics and then importing the mesh Collider and choosing which one you could also simply go to where your imported the mesh so let's click the half sphere under the import settings there's a box called generate colliders and this will automatically generate may attach this mesh Collider to the object so for now let's go ahead and disable this section one and move on to section two I'll just reposition the camera so we can take a look at section two now we have quite a few things going on here we have some different boxes some different planes which are rigidbody boxes will then collide with let's take a look at how this works with the setup we have notice the reference they are set in the exact same position in the sack same rotation with the exact same size of a plane all the planes have box colliders attached all of these cubes are exactly the same they all have a rigidbody and a box Collider and then of course they are using the gravity though there's something different with these other than just the color these different boxes are using what is called a physics material you can insert a physics material once it's created under the Box Collider or just the collider in general right here under the material in this case I've inserted a ice material this means that this plane will from now on interact just like ice so when I hit the play button we can see that our box collides and then just slides down because ice is very slippery if we move on to the next one I've attached a metal physics material so this will interact just like metal no bounciness no slipperiness and the box just rolls off it and the last one I've attached the bouncy bouncy physics material so when we hit play the cube jumps off just like with the trampoline and this gives a very large control over the way that rigid bodies will interact with static objects or other rigid bodies so let's take a look at how you can create these kind of physics materials first of all if you just want to play around with it and get started it's a good idea to observe some already created physics material so let's download the standard assets physics material right click on the project pane hit the import package and here we can hit the physic materials this will make this folder appear under the standard assets I've just gone out and dragged it out so we can play with it right here on the in this folder you will find quite a few physics materials your frowned and find a bouncy one the one I used on the pink a nice one the one I used on the first one a metal one the one I used in the metal and then a wrapper and then wood now if we select for example the bouncy physics material we have quite a few things to change the bounciness is set to one this means that it will be as bouncy as can be if we change the if we drag this down a bit maybe at 0.25 let's see what happens so the cube does bounce a little bit more than normal but not all the way let's make it 0.5 you can see more bouncing there starts to appear and so on you can also adjust stuff like friction combine friction compound binds bounciness the direction of the friction and a lot of other variables I won't go into too much detail but have fun play around with it you can't basically you can't do anything wrong but it is a nice addition to the ordinary collision system so for now let's go ahead and disable this section alright I maybe forgot to tell you how do you create a physics material on your own you can simply go to the project pane hit the create and then physic material let's enable the last section I've made here it is and this is a model I very simple box model I created inside of Maya and this is pretty low poly though it could have been even simpler and you it could already it could always be more detailed so keep in mind that the methods we're going to be using here are for more detailed objects where the mesh Collider is simply too taxing on the computer first I have a example with collision gone wrong let's go ahead and hit play maybe just reposition the camera so you can have a look at what's happening hit the play button hmm that doesn't seem right this should be falling more to the left and a little forwards let's take a look look at what have gone wrong the collider we have attached to this game object it's a box Collider it's not detailed enough so we could instead attach the mesh Collider this would give beautiful collision though this could again be very taxing if this object was more detailed and had a lot of vertices and maybe round shapes let's go ahead and disable this and take a look at what I have done instead so here you can see a very detailed Collider that pretty much covers the whole object let's go ahead and just see if this works by hitting play indeed the weapon or whatever this is collides beautifully with the floor this is because I have made a series of ordinary colliders and combined them to create a nice working collider shape which is still not too taxing on the computer so let's go ahead and focus on the weird shape down here and if we expand this I have created a empty game object called colliders and under this I've parented all the different colliders I've created and this is just empty game objects with box colliders attached to them and together they create a whole shape around a model this could also be done with create by creating a series of other kinds of colliders you could make empty game objects storing colliders like the sphere Collider or the capsule Collider so on making your own colliders is a good way to still get nice physic interaction without without the computer having to do a lot of work so that's basically it for the mastering collision tutorial I hope this was helpful to you this is an introduction to collision though it covers pretty much all aspects of creating collision inside of unity and thank you for watching I'll see you in the next video you
