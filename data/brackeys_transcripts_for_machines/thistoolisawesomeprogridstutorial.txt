some man walks into a bar and says have you heard about unities new grid system it's really great especially because the old one was so bad and the bartender goes oh snap so unity recently acquired poly brush and Pro Builder which are two really powerful tools for artists and along the way they also picked up progress procreates is an awesome grid based snapping solution I personally just started using it and I can say that I'm never ever going back progard's makes it extremely easy to quickly sketch out levels place and align objects or just keep your OCD in check so let's have a look at how to use it but first this video is sponsored by Skillshare Skillshare is an online learning community with more than 19 thousand quality classes on tech design and more if for example you want to learn how to create a beautiful logo for your game I personally really enjoyed this course on the fundamentals of logo design the tutor Aaron drab Lin is just super fun to learn from Skillshare even has a course specifically on designing a game logo using illustrator a premium Skillshare membership gives you unlimited access to all classes for less than $10 a month so to get started simply click the link in the description and the first 500 people will receive their first two months for only 99 cents alright let's delve right into it to make sure you have Pro Grid installed it's currently hosted on the asset store so we'll go window and select asset store here you can search for appropriate and hit the red button to download and import it will of course have a link for this in the description and right away you should see that in your project window that's a folder called pro core then to enable pro grids and show all the settings we go to tools Pro grids and we open the programs window and right away we can see the visual appearance of our grid changes and we get all these buttons in the upper left hand corner and if I just select my cube here you can see a weird thing happens for some reason the grid changes if I then select the ground the grid changes right back the reason for this is that we currently have a setting enabled that will change the grid for the selected object to disable this we'll go to the left here and click on the lock icon and you can see that we can select any of our objects and the grid will stay the same also make sure to go to the top left and change from Center to pivot if it isn't already and now we can actually start moving our object around the grid and you will see it snaps right in place we can easily change the size of the grid by using this setting at the top in fact we don't even have to touch it we can just use the plus and minus commands in order to change it so this makes it much quicker to adjust how you want your snapping to be if we do click on it however if we get some general snapping settings mainly we can choose whether or not we want to snap when scaling if we enable this and change to our scale tool you can see that our object snaps here as well we can also choose what units to use for our grid most of the time we are going to be using the default meter but really the most important setting here is what is called predictive grid and this is something I noticed right away when I started using it this setting is totally a matter of preference some people love it I really do not let me show you what it does so right now if we move around our cube our grid stays the same because we are kind of viewing it from above but if I go ahead and change my view to kind of a side view you'll see that the great changes as soon as I move the cube and if we go and view it from the other side here and move it we get another grid on this axis and this is what is called the predictive grid we always choose what grid to show manually by selecting either X Y C or a full 3d view if we want to see all of the axes at once but most of the time when I'm building I like to only see the Y grid so I like to go to the top here and simply disable predictive grid and now it doesn't matter where I'm viewing my object from it will always stay the same unless I decide to change it if your grid kind of gets in the way we can always disable it up here now snapping will still be turned on but the grid will be invisible we can just turn it back on but if we wanted to turn off snapping we can do that with the on and off button here turn that often of course now the object is moving smoothly another really useful feature is that we can align objects that on within the grid to the grid by simply pressing a button say if we increase the size of our grid here and move our object kind of outside it and we want to snap it back in place well then we simply use this button right here that snaps all selected objects to the grid and whether the cube snaps right back now I'm gonna decrease the size of our grid again I'm gonna turn snapping back on and I'm gonna move it back up here finally there are actually a bunch of preferences that we can adjust to further configure this tool to that we go to edit preferences and in this window we can go under Pro grates and then we can see we can adjust the color of the different grids as well as the Alpha value here we can also change some of the grid settings as well as change all the different shortcuts if you're unsatisfied with your settings simply hit reset and yes and they will change right back to normal one setting that is pretty important to note is the snap method currently this is set to snap on all axes now what this means is that if we go ahead and select our ground for example which is currently moved underneath our grid and we try and move it over on the X we can see that we can successfully move the ground but it does snap up in place on the Y even though we were only trying to move it on the X this is of course because pro builder tries to keep all the objects aligned with the grid on all axes which in some cases is really great but in this case we want to have our own Y value so if we undo this and change the setting to snap on selected axis and try and do the same you can see that the object now only snaps on the axis that we're currently moving it in and that's pretty much a quick introduction to progress now of course one of the greatest things about this asset is that it works seamlessly with pro builder say we're working with a model inside of pro builder and we want it to snap to the grid well we actually don't need to do any setup we can just go ahead and use it and right away you will see the snapping working this makes it incredibly useful for great boxing and creating levels that are always aligned pretty cool that's pretty much it for this video if you enjoyed it you can subscribe
