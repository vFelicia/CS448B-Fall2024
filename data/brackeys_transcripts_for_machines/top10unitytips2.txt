hello everyone I just can't believe how well my previous Unity tips were received I love of you guys were asking for more so here are my top 10 Unity quick tips 2.0 all right let's go number one maximizing Windows you can quickly maximize and minimize windows in Unity by hovering over them and hitting shift space this is particularly useful for the scene and game View and sometimes even the animator if you're working on a large controller number two locking layers sometimes when you're working on a scene with a lot of objects it can be hard to select the right one thankfully Unity allows you to create a layer assign objects you don't want to click on to that layer and then lock it it even works for sorting layers as well now you can click away without a care in the world number three quick Focus now most people who've been using Unity for a little while probably know that you can quickly focus on an object by selecting it hovering over the scene View and hitting F but something that a lot of people Miss is that if you double tap the F key you will lock onto that object this is really useful if you want to inspect moving objects number four tool tips in the last video we looked at using heads and spaces to better organize your script but if you want to be 100% on top of your inspector game you can use the tool tip attribute to write a variable description that will appear when hovering over it number five Auto statements when writing for Loop there's quite a bit of syntax that you need to get right luckily in Visual Studio you can simply write four and then press the Tab Key twice this will automatically generate a fol you you can now just tap through and fill out the desired information then hit enter to complete it this also works with if forage while and switch statements number six regions for some reason I see very few people using regions been programming in unity personally I couldn't do a day without it regions allow you to Mark a certain part of your code this way if you sometimes Rite monstrously large scripts like I do you can easily collapse parts of your code to focus on the important bits to begin a section simply write # region and insert # and region to close it number seven documentation shortcut ever wondered what a component does or what one of the variables mean well you can quickly navigate to the documentation for a component by simply hitting the book in the upper right corner this is a lot faster than doing a Google search number eight expand and collapse all if you're holding down alt while expanding an object in the hierarchy it will expand all child objects as well the same thing happens when collapsing number nine color picking again most people probably know that you can sample colors using the Color Picker one neat thing about this though is that you can actually pick colors from outside the unity editor number 10 undocking the preview if you're inspecting a model animation and want to get a closer look you can right click in the upper part of the preview to undug it that's pretty much all the tips and tricks could fit into this video thanks to all the people who shared their favorite tips in the comments if you want to get any of the assets seen in this video you can go to Dev assets.com if you want to see more videos like this one consider subscribing you can also support me at Patron
