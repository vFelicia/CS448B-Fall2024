math Theory today we'll be exploring the branch of Applied Mathematics that is referred to as Dynamics which for us means the study of forces we'll be looking at how you can apply forces to an object in order to make it move and we'll use these techniques to create a simulation of the effects of gravity in space so what's a force forces can be described as a push or a pull on an object let's say we have a friend called Tom Tom is standing on a railroad track and in front of him is a card as Tom begins to push the cart he's applying a force which makes the cart move forwards how far the cart moves is determined by how hard Tom pushes meaning the magnitude of the force and at the same time by how heavy the card is meaning the mass of the card but how do we describe this mathematically well luckily we aren't the first ones to ask that question in fact it was already in the middle of the 1600s that a clever Englishmen started to wonder about it the name of the Curious guy was Isaac Newton and in 1686 he presented his three laws of motion the answer lies within the second law it states that acceleration which is a change in velocity is produced when a force acts on a mass the greater the mass of the object the greater the amount of force needed to accelerate it or as he simply put it acceleration equals force over Mass so let's say that Tom pushes the card with a force of 400 n the N here stands for Newton and is the standard measurement for Force let's also imagine that the card has a mass of 50 kilos the resulting acceleration of the card not counting any friction from the wheels would then be 400n ided 50 kilos which after a bit of trickery with the units gives 8 m/s squared it can be hard to visualize what an effect such an acceleration has on the card so let's instead figure out the speed of the card and how far it has moved after a certain amount of seconds if Tom keeps pushing the card with the same force it will slowly increase in speed we say that velocity equals acceleration multiply with time so after pushing the card for 1 second it will move at a speed of 8 m per second squ multiply with 1 second which is equal to 8 m/s if we show the speed over time on a graph we can see that it increases LLY as Tom pushes the cart we can also get the distance that the cart moves we say that distance equals half the acceleration multiplied with time squared so after 1 second the card will have moved half * 8 m/s s * 1 second SAR which is equal to 4 M again we can show this on a graph to see that the card moves further away at an increasing rate but what happens if multiple forces are acting on an object in our example another friend shows up called Dwayne Dwayne works out and is able to push at a greater force than Tom because Dwayne pushes in the opposite direction he will overwhelm Tom and push the card back we say that the resulting force on an object is the sum of all the acting forces so in our case we have two acting forces the push of Tom and Dwayne and the resulting force is the push of Tom which is 400 Newton plus the push of Dwayne let's say that's 600 Newton but because Dwayne is pushing in the next negative Direction the resulting Force becomes 400 Newton 600 Newton which is equal to 200 Newton and so the acceleration of the card is 4 m/s squared making the card move backwards one of the most interesting things to study when it comes to forces is gravity because unlike Dwayne pushing a card gravity cannot be seen and yet it is constantly affecting the world around us in fact gravity is a force that acts between all objects that means that when Earth pulls Dwayne down he's actually creating an equal large pole on the Earth but because the Earth has a much bigger Mass it doesn't move much again thanks to Newton we can describe the magnitude of the force that acts on two objects all we need to know is the mass of the objects that are attracting each other and the distance between them so let's say that two bowling balls are floating in space that's probably the weirdest thing I've said today I mean what are they even doing there are the Space Monkeys bowling let's say that the mass of the first ball is 1 kilo and the mass of the second ball is 2 kilos and that's exactly 1 M between the center of each ball we can then calculate the force that we should apply to each object as the mass of the first ball multiplied with the mass of the second ball divided by the distance squared we also need to multiply with the gravitational constant which is basically just a very small number that helps sort out the units so if we calculate this out we can see that our two bowling balls will attract each other with a force of 1.33 multip with 10 to the^ of 10 Newtons this might seem as an extraordinarily small number and it definitely is but remember that it will will drastically increase as the objects move closer to each other and try to imagine just how large this number gets when the objects are as heavy as moons or planets so how do we use this information to simulate the effects of gravity acting on several objects in space well we simply keep a list of all the objects in the scene then each frame we Loop through the list and for each object we will apply a force to all other objects and calculate the magnitude of each Force using the formula we can then use our knowledge from earlier to move each object according to the forces AC on it and the result should look something like this if you want to play around with it yourself there will be a link to the source code in the description that's pretty much all I have to show for this video if you're interested in learning more about Dynamics there's a link for that in the description as well I hope you enjoyed this episode
