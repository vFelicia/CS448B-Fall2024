00:00 - hello students today we are going to see
00:03 - decision making statements decision
00:06 - making statements are also called
00:08 - selection statements in java we have if
00:12 - conditions and switch case these
00:16 - statements hello to control the flow of
00:19 - execution of a program which is based on
00:22 - the conditional expressions given let us
00:26 - create a class conditional you are going
00:33 - to see only you conditionally okay so
00:40 - delete all this let us take closed on
00:44 - the previous one until we take by input
00:47 - so until this we copy put a randomly
00:54 - paste let us change this conditional if
01:03 - if so let us have an example program to
01:08 - find whether the given number is even or
01:10 - not so we have here importing statement
01:29 - then class as conditional conditional
01:37 - yes and then we take a number to check
01:43 - whether the given number is given so
01:46 - just we assign a variable single
01:49 - variable Y and then we do not consider
01:51 - this and then scan it obj little bit of
01:58 - grac we want to change we can change
02:00 - this yes
02:02 - so system gotta enter that number enter
02:10 - the number and then disagree in the same
02:13 - line with so user enters the number and
02:18 - then we take test the N is equal to
02:22 - object name that is yes we ugly no yes
02:26 - that next inter so after taking the
02:34 - number we should know logically how to
02:35 - check whether the given number is given
02:37 - basically when even number is there
02:41 - we are divided by 2 then we do not get
02:44 - any remainder so now let us view the
02:46 - condition if condition is given inside
02:50 - the parenthesis if n mod 2 is equal to
02:56 - equal to a single equal to value that
02:59 - becomes assignment or greater which is
03:00 - the value if we do W equal to then it
03:04 - says we checks whether the condition is
03:08 - true or not whether it is equal or not
03:09 - so this is called condition up to T or
03:12 - total so equal to equal to 0 and then we
03:16 - say the result Pro printing statement
03:21 - system duck Oh
03:24 - frankly no so we say this is even in
03:29 - degree even so the if condition can be
03:35 - without block of code when there is
03:38 - single printing segment or single
03:41 - statement is given and then we close
03:43 - there with that close then class
03:50 - let us compile this no syntax error
03:55 - please give this we use 98 so it is even
04:05 - it said if we you number which is not a
04:10 - um number odd number it is not going to
04:13 - say anything just it is going to like if
04:20 - we want to print even odd number so we
04:25 - will have the else condition here else
04:28 - is given yes there is no condition we're
04:33 - to give to be given quickly you here
04:36 - system dot out dot print line of odd so
04:46 - let us compare this so now even it is a
04:50 - number it is going to say that result
04:54 - so now physically odd if you want to
05:02 - check the series of conditions then we
05:05 - need if else if ladder so for example if
05:10 - we give a student mark then it says
05:15 - which grade it is for example above 80
05:20 - that is a distinction then 60 to 80
05:23 - maybe first last 40 to 60 maybe second
05:28 - class and then lesser than fortieth
05:30 - maybe Facebook so let us have a program
05:34 - for this so we you firstly let us take
05:37 - these conditions in the comment line so
05:41 - we have here if to another number is so
05:49 - you will get this think that
06:08 - more space in greater than 80 and let's
06:18 - go to them kadhi 10 distinction
06:30 - distinction save if greater than 16 and
06:42 - lesser then not equal to s again 80
06:53 - tenses for success so if it is greater
07:07 - than 40 greater than or equal to we can
07:13 - check a quad result equal equal to
07:18 - greater than equal to less than or equal
07:24 - to or equal to greater than or
07:33 - equal unless again plus again 60 say
07:43 - second class is below okay let
08:08 - us consider this let us take any input
08:13 - as mark REM then we are going to cut the
08:19 - mark
08:20 - until the mark associate the variable
08:26 - change again it is taken now we are
08:29 - going to check the veins so for this we
08:32 - need to have the logical operator called
08:35 - end operator so let us consider the n is
08:39 - greater than or equal to KT and then is
08:43 - the adapt egg and Kami's yesterday I
08:47 - said then I this protocol under you say
08:51 - s description so you'll see is going to
09:02 - the last condition is to create more
09:04 - condition say it is greater than or
09:08 - equal to 60 and lesser than 8 so it says
09:18 - first class
09:31 - so if it is less than 40 and I sell them
09:39 - 60 say second class second class else it
09:50 - is going to the last condition we don't
09:52 - need to check so we are not going to
09:54 - give any conditions here so here it is
09:57 - not if we supposed to be else--if
10:00 - else--if else--if yes so this is the
10:08 - else else if glad companies right click
10:17 - on this we will check all the ranges say
10:22 - 98 distinction say 45 second class 35
10:41 - first class say cutting so maybe I think
10:51 - we are not changing okay we are not
10:54 - saying we finish salvation okay so
10:58 - complete this and then it is director
11:00 - say free 30 okay I think you learnt if
11:10 - condition today let us see switch case
11:15 - if not in next session

hello students today we are going to see decision making statements decision making statements are also called selection statements in java we have if conditions and switch case these statements hello to control the flow of execution of a program which is based on the conditional expressions given let us create a class conditional you are going to see only you conditionally okay so delete all this let us take closed on the previous one until we take by input so until this we copy put a randomly paste let us change this conditional if if so let us have an example program to find whether the given number is even or not so we have here importing statement then class as conditional conditional yes and then we take a number to check whether the given number is given so just we assign a variable single variable Y and then we do not consider this and then scan it obj little bit of grac we want to change we can change this yes so system gotta enter that number enter the number and then disagree in the same line with so user enters the number and then we take test the N is equal to object name that is yes we ugly no yes that next inter so after taking the number we should know logically how to check whether the given number is given basically when even number is there we are divided by 2 then we do not get any remainder so now let us view the condition if condition is given inside the parenthesis if n mod 2 is equal to equal to a single equal to value that becomes assignment or greater which is the value if we do W equal to then it says we checks whether the condition is true or not whether it is equal or not so this is called condition up to T or total so equal to equal to 0 and then we say the result Pro printing statement system duck Oh frankly no so we say this is even in degree even so the if condition can be without block of code when there is single printing segment or single statement is given and then we close there with that close then class let us compile this no syntax error please give this we use 98 so it is even it said if we you number which is not a um number odd number it is not going to say anything just it is going to like if we want to print even odd number so we will have the else condition here else is given yes there is no condition we're to give to be given quickly you here system dot out dot print line of odd so let us compare this so now even it is a number it is going to say that result so now physically odd if you want to check the series of conditions then we need if else if ladder so for example if we give a student mark then it says which grade it is for example above 80 that is a distinction then 60 to 80 maybe first last 40 to 60 maybe second class and then lesser than fortieth maybe Facebook so let us have a program for this so we you firstly let us take these conditions in the comment line so we have here if to another number is so you will get this think that more space in greater than 80 and let's go to them kadhi 10 distinction distinction save if greater than 16 and lesser then not equal to s again 80 tenses for success so if it is greater than 40 greater than or equal to we can check a quad result equal equal to greater than equal to less than or equal to or equal to greater than or equal unless again plus again 60 say second class is below okay let us consider this let us take any input as mark REM then we are going to cut the mark until the mark associate the variable change again it is taken now we are going to check the veins so for this we need to have the logical operator called end operator so let us consider the n is greater than or equal to KT and then is the adapt egg and Kami's yesterday I said then I this protocol under you say s description so you'll see is going to the last condition is to create more condition say it is greater than or equal to 60 and lesser than 8 so it says first class so if it is less than 40 and I sell them 60 say second class second class else it is going to the last condition we don't need to check so we are not going to give any conditions here so here it is not if we supposed to be elseif elseif elseif yes so this is the else else if glad companies right click on this we will check all the ranges say 98 distinction say 45 second class 35 first class say cutting so maybe I think we are not changing okay we are not saying we finish salvation okay so complete this and then it is director say free 30 okay I think you learnt if condition today let us see switch case if not in next session
