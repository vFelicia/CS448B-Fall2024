With timestamps:

00:00 - welcome students until now we were using
00:04 - main method which is a standard method
00:07 - so that was public static fly me up
00:14 - string aft arguments now we will see the
00:18 - definition of each one so let us first
00:21 - consider this public so public is an
00:25 - access specifier this can be either
00:29 - public or private our protocol these
00:38 - specifiers determine the type of access
00:42 - to the function that means these
00:46 - keywords decides whether a method in a
00:49 - class can be used are invoked by another
00:53 - method in another class our subclass we
00:58 - can write public or private our
01:03 - prototype even without this also we can
01:05 - create a method when we don't give any
01:09 - of these three keywords then it is
01:11 - called default access specified the next
01:15 - keyword is static so static is a
01:19 - modifier other modifiers are final
01:23 - native transient and volatile method
01:28 - becomes a static method when we use a
01:31 - keyword called static even we can
01:35 - declare variables also using static
01:39 - keyword then it becomes static variable
01:42 - static methods also called class methods
01:46 - because these methods can be called
01:50 - without creating an object of that class
01:53 - that we will see later of this session
01:56 - so the next keyword is wild so public
02:00 - static void so what is a return type
02:03 - when it is not returning any value in
02:07 - struct this void we can use any of the
02:10 - datatype
02:12 - two data types so maybe inter-are maybe
02:15 - double so when we have these keywords
02:18 - then that it is going to return any data
02:23 - value which is mentioned that for that
02:25 - we have to specify return at the end
02:29 - after next comes main main is the name
02:38 - of the method then off so now here it
02:45 - isn't the third prototype if you need we
02:47 - can also add public from liquid so it
02:52 - becomes public static void main of
02:54 - instead of this main we can have any
02:57 - name so that it is an identifier for
03:00 - example I say calc so here tank is the
03:05 - name of this method which is going to
03:08 - return a double value and then it is a
03:11 - static method it is having access
03:13 - piss-filled as public next let us write
03:20 - the course what we need scanner will be
03:26 - JS for the new kind of system bottom and
03:34 - then let us say some variables before
03:39 - this into X Y and then double this
03:51 - difference difference this is to
03:56 - calculate the difference between two
03:58 - numbers so let us figure the printing
04:05 - statement to the out inclined off
04:13 - I guess number let us create a method
04:25 - but X is equal to all these a duck next
04:31 - point off and I will now protecting
04:37 - string back out back x ID here is a
04:42 - mistake it sister hold back print kind
04:49 - of health and no y is equal to obj dot
05:06 - next winter so now we are going to see
05:12 - the difference depth is equal to X minus
05:18 - y so let us print this system out print
05:35 - difference is equal to this so here you
05:42 - are we have given the output using the
05:44 - printing statement solar does not have
05:46 - double instead of this let us have wild
05:51 - so when it is not returning anything so
05:53 - we will let see further how it is going
05:56 - to written so let us compare this no
05:59 - syntax error we are running this wide
06:03 - calc off so enter a number so difference
06:11 - do you got it in double so let us clear
06:14 - this close and then now I will teach you
06:18 - how it is going to return so let us
06:21 - consider double here so we know that
06:26 - difference is a double rate so in stock
06:29 - this statement we will write return so
06:33 - what it is going to return is diff let
06:41 - us compare this no syntax errors so now
06:44 - the output will be in a dialog box so
06:49 - enter a number so you can see that a
06:55 - dialog box appears which returned here
06:58 - as double data type then 8000 point 0 as
07:03 - a difference let us close this so now
07:08 - let me explain about the theorem a test
07:11 - which we give in the method so let us
07:13 - not have this and then we are not taking
07:17 - any input from the user using scanner
07:20 - class so let us not have all this and
07:24 - then you one get us not have please so
07:28 - now we can see very simple program
07:30 - public static double Kalka the input
07:33 - from the parameter so even the x and y
07:36 - is also not required here so we are
07:38 - going to MU the parameter here so when
07:41 - we give here the variable with its data
07:44 - type we are going to give so for how it
07:47 - space X so this is one variable and then
07:52 - when we knew the variable in the
07:54 - parameter list we have to again give the
07:58 - variable though it is same I again we
08:01 - have to say ink and then but but this
08:04 - will not work with X comma Y if you do
08:06 - it will not work so this is the way to
08:09 - give X and one so what so we have given
08:14 - here two variables that is as a
08:18 - parameter so let us consider this
08:21 - program and then it is also returning
08:24 - which is a double type then the working
08:27 - is calculating the difference close
08:32 - to compile so now you can see a dialog
08:40 - box where it is asking in text and
08:43 - employed let us give here what is X and
08:47 - then Y is okay so it has returned a
08:56 - double data type which is minus four
08:59 - five three seven five eight point zero
09:01 - so this is the way of taking input using
09:04 - parameter and then getting the return in
09:12 - case if we have some other data type for
09:14 - example we say bullet boolean so just we
09:21 - are taking any age just let us consider
09:24 - as late so age it is taking and then
09:27 - what it is going to return means it must
09:29 - return boolean data type so let us have
09:33 - pool in yeah just for an example and
09:40 - then if Y is greater than or equal to 60
09:49 - here we are checking whether given is
09:52 - seen yes it is are not so let us not
09:56 - have this so if it is greater than a we
10:00 - say m is important too is M is going to
10:09 - be false so what it is going to return
10:15 - here is yeah see now if the condition is
10:21 - true you're miss going to be true
10:24 - otherwise it is going to be false what
10:27 - it is going to return yam so young here
10:29 - is a boolean type so we are having
10:31 - boolean type as a returns here let us
10:36 - compile this no syntax error right click
10:42 - so we say different so it is not a
10:49 - senior citizen so it says boolean false
10:53 - so now let us see how this static works
10:57 - it does not have this study here and
11:00 - then let us not even have publish here
11:06 - so now if we compile this see there is
11:10 - no syntax errors
11:11 - let us run when static is not that we
11:14 - need an object so it will ask for you to
11:18 - create an object so oh it is asking
11:22 - create object so name of the app the
11:25 - default by default sir it has come just
11:28 - with you okay so we can see here a red
11:30 - box which is an object right click on
11:33 - this now you run this boolean calc
11:36 - intier it asks for the value so 85 if I
11:41 - you it returns true it is a senior
11:44 - citizen so one more thing I wanted to
11:50 - tell you are not the same time we can
11:52 - print and as well as we can take a
11:56 - return from the that how we can use some
12:00 - de system duck over in China so we are
12:09 - every citizen okay this let it be in
12:18 - true when it is truly we say inside so
12:21 - let it be here
12:22 - and then when there is more than one
12:25 - statement under if so we must open the
12:29 - block of statement so let us have this
12:36 - so else we are going to say false
12:45 - [Applause]
12:47 - so we are not not a senior citizen
12:55 - however it is returning the value okay
12:59 - so he has putting statement X also there
13:01 - and then returning values also complain
13:14 - we have not terminated so so now there
13:18 - is no syntax errors
13:20 - let us run this program so you say 45
13:35 - okay see you are not a senior citizen it
13:39 - is printed here and as well as we will
13:41 - see that it will turn see it is they get
13:46 - close one more thing I will tell you if
13:52 - this printing statement comes at last
13:57 - anything you after the return statement
14:01 - that is this for example on giving so
14:05 - after that is a return statement so that
14:08 - I told already return statement will be
14:10 - a last statement in line with that if we
14:12 - give this waterbugs let us see compile
14:16 - so it says untreatable statement so we
14:19 - have to do any printing segment if we
14:23 - need that should be before the return
14:26 - string Thank You students I hope you
14:29 - learnt the user differing the method and
14:32 - then all the keywords why do we use in
14:35 - the method prototype let us see in the
14:38 - next class thank you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome students until now we were using main method which is a standard method so that was public static fly me up string aft arguments now we will see the definition of each one so let us first

becomes a static method when we use a keyword called static even we can declare variables also using static keyword then it becomes static variable static methods also called class methods because these methods can be called without creating an object of that class that we will see later of this session so the next keyword is wild so public static void so what is a return type when it is not returning any value in struct this void we can use any of the datatype two data types so maybe interare maybe double so when we have these keywords then that it is going to return any data value which is mentioned that for that we have to specify return at the end after next comes main main is the name of the method then off so now here it isn't the third prototype if you need we can also add public from liquid so it becomes public static void main of instead of this main we can have any name so that it is an identifier for example I say calc so here tank is the name of this method which is going to return a double value and then it is a static method it is having access pissfilled as public next let us write the course what we need scanner will be JS for the new kind of system bottom and then let us say some variables before this into X Y and then double this difference difference this is to calculate the difference between two numbers so let us figure the printing statement to the out inclined off I guess number let us create a method but X is equal to all these a duck next point off and I will now protecting string back out back x ID here is a mistake it sister hold back print kind of health and no y is equal to obj dot next winter so now we are going to see the difference depth is equal to X minus y so let us print this system out print difference is equal to this so here you are we have given the output using the printing statement solar does not have double instead of this let us have wild so when it is not returning anything so we will let see further how it is going to written so let us compare this no syntax error we are running this wide calc off so enter a number so difference do you got it in double so let us clear this close and then now I will teach you how it is going to return so let us consider double here so we know that difference is a double rate so in stock this statement we will write return so what it is going to return is diff let us compare this no syntax errors so now the output will be in a dialog box so enter a number so you can see that a dialog box appears which returned here as double data type then 8000 point 0 as a difference let us close this so now let me explain about the theorem a test which we give in the method so let us not have this and then we are not taking any input from the user using scanner class so let us not have all this and then you one get us not have please so now we can see very simple program public static double Kalka the input from the parameter so even the x and y is also not

variable in the parameter list we have to again give the variable though it is same I again we have to say ink and then but but this will not work with X comma Y if you do it will not work so this is the way to give X and one so what so we have given here two variables that is as a parameter so let us consider this program and then it is also returning which is a double type then the working is calculating the difference close to compile so now you can see a dialog box where it is asking in text and employed let us give here what is X and then Y is okay so it has returned a double data type which is minus four five three seven five eight point zero so this is the way of taking input using parameter and then getting the return in case if we have some other data type for example we say bullet boolean so just we are taking any age just let us consider as late so age it is taking and then what it is going to return means it must return boolean data type so let us have pool in yeah just for an example and then if Y is greater than or equal to 60 here we are checking whether given is seen yes it is are not so let us not have this so if it is greater than a we say m is important too is M is going to be false so what it is going to return here is yeah see now if the condition is true you're miss going to be true otherwise it is going to be false what it is going to return yam so young here is a boolean type so we are having boolean type as a returns here let us compile this no syntax error right click so we say different so it is not a senior citizen so it says boolean false so now let us see how this static works it does not have this study here and then let us not even have publish here so now if we compile this see there is no syntax errors let us run when static is not that we need an object so it will ask for you to create an object so oh it is asking create object so name of the app the default by default sir it has come just with you okay so we can see here a red box which is an object right click on this now you run this boolean calc intier it asks for the value so 85 if I you it returns true it is a senior citizen so one more thing I wanted to tell you are not the same time we can print and as well as we can take a return from the that how we can use some de system duck over in China so we are every citizen okay this let it be in true when it is truly we say inside so let it be here and then when there is more than one statement under if so we must open the block of statement so let us have this so else we are going to say false so we are not not a senior citizen however it is returning the value okay so he has putting statement X also there and then returning values also complain we have not terminated so so now there is no syntax errors let us run this program so you say 45 okay see you are not a senior citizen it is printed here and as well as we will see that it will turn see it is they get close one more thing I will tell you if this printing statement comes at last anything you after the return statement that is this for example on giving so after that is a return statement so that I told already return statement will be a last statement in line with that if we give this waterbugs let us see compile so it says untreatable statement so we have to do any printing segment if we need that should be before the return string Thank You students I hope you learnt the user differing the method and then all the keywords why do we use in the method prototype let us see in the next class thank you
