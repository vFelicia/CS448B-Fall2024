00:02 - welcome back students today we are going
00:05 - to see math functions in Java we know
00:09 - how to solve a simple mathematical
00:11 - expression using variables constant and
00:15 - operators but to solve mathematical
00:19 - expressions with powers square roots etc
00:23 - we need some special functions Java
00:27 - provides math class with many
00:30 - mathematical functions this math
00:32 - function is available in java dot Lang
00:35 - package you know land packages default
00:39 - package which we don't need to import
00:42 - let us see the math functions available
00:45 - in java syntax of math function is like
00:50 - this math dot that is a machine capital
00:54 - dot function name the name of the
00:56 - function available in Java then in the
01:00 - bracket we give the argument list
01:02 - otherwise a single argument to find the
01:04 - power of any number we have P whoa W of
01:09 - X comma Y so X and Y is arguments here Y
01:14 - is raised to the power X so for example
01:17 - we may have math dot P whoa W of 5 comma
01:22 - 2 25.0 most of the math functions return
01:27 - double pipe output next we have SQ RT of
01:32 - any argument this will give the square
01:35 - root of a number
01:37 - example here math dot s qrp of 36 this
01:43 - will return six point zero next we have
01:47 - seal of a number this method helps to
01:53 - round up the decimal number to a integer
01:57 - value but gives the output as double
02:01 - value for example we have three hundred
02:05 - twelve point three four
02:06 - this will round to the next higher value
02:10 - of integer maybe here
02:13 - our 3r8 whatever it is that is lesser
02:16 - than five or more than five that doesn't
02:19 - matter
02:19 - this will round up so we will have 313
02:25 - as the output next we have floor of a
02:28 - number this will round down a decimal
02:32 - number though the decimal point has five
02:37 - or more than that it will not consider
02:40 - it will only round out so that means the
02:43 - decimal number completely left and then
02:45 - it becomes only 45 here another one we
02:50 - have here rent of the number this will
02:54 - round as per mathematical rule so here
03:01 - we have ninety one point five six if it
03:03 - is five or more than 5 it will round up
03:06 - otherwise we will round down so here as
03:11 - per mathematical rule we have 92 as
03:14 - output next we have ABS of X so this is
03:19 - the absolute value absolute value is the
03:23 - position of a number either left side or
03:27 - right side of the zero in the number
03:30 - line for example if we have a number
03:33 - line like this zero is in middle right
03:37 - side we will have all positive numbers
03:39 - in left side or negative numbers if we
03:43 - take minus three as a number absolute
03:46 - value of this is three that is counter
03:49 - only the position of the number it
03:53 - doesn't matter whether in negative side
03:55 - or positive side so absolute value of
03:58 - minus three becomes three in mathematics
04:01 - we have two vertical lines like this to
04:05 - mention the absolute value if we take
04:07 - one then we will have absolute value of
04:10 - 1 is 1 itself this function will help us
04:15 - to convert negative value into positive
04:19 - value for example if we have minus 72
04:25 - point three this will
04:26 - become seventy two point three next we
04:30 - have Mei X of two arguments here this
04:33 - will return the greater value of the
04:37 - given two number for example we have
04:40 - five point six and seven point two the
04:43 - greater values seven point two this get
04:46 - returned next we have my enough two
04:50 - arguments this will return the smaller
04:54 - value here this will return eight point
04:58 - two six
05:00 - next we have exp of X this will give the
05:04 - result of X raised to the power e for
05:10 - example we have math dot exp of five
05:15 - next we have log of X this will give
05:19 - large epidemic value of X next we have
05:27 - sine of X this will return sine value of
05:31 - x and then cos cos value of x and then
05:37 - tan tan value of x next we have random
05:43 - off this will not take any argument but
05:47 - it will return any random number with
05:50 - double type now let us test these
05:53 - mathematical functions through a program
05:59 - program to test map functions import
06:08 - Java dot IO dot star plus math class
06:31 - let us declare the variables we should
06:58 - have throws ioexception prompting the
07:08 - user a is equal to 2 double dot parse
07:30 - double of BR dot readline off let me
07:38 - copy these two lines power here it is B
07:49 - so let me have one more variable called
07:54 - just C so we are going to do C is equal
07:58 - to math dot P whoa W of a commodity let
08:07 - us print this
08:15 - simply give power plus that is C let me
08:22 - also have the square root without
08:25 - variable directly let me print so that
08:41 - is directly I am going to write the
08:43 - function here math dot s QR t off let me
08:49 - have a itself compile this enter the
09:00 - base say 25 to the power 2 so 25 to the
09:08 - power 2 is 625 square root of 25 is 5
09:17 - now let us write the code to round off
09:20 - the numbers enter decimal number so here
09:31 - a is going to be a decimal number let me
09:36 - remove this let me remove this also now
09:41 - b is equal to math dot seal of a then C
09:54 - is equal to math dot floor half a then
10:04 - let me have one more value this B D is
10:11 - equal to math dot print off here so I
10:21 - will have here 3 printing statements
10:26 - first we'll print this is SIL so up this
10:35 - roundup so what it will print it is B
10:42 - then here rounded down this C as per
10:57 - mathematical rules just D so let me
11:13 - compile this
11:19 - I am giving him five point six now when
11:26 - it rounds using seal function it will
11:29 - round up so six point zero if it is
11:33 - floor function though it is more than
11:36 - 0.5 it will round to the down value that
11:40 - is 5 will remain this is neglected as
11:44 - per mathematics as this is more than 0.5
11:49 - it will round up that will become 6 let
11:53 - us have one more example with lesser
11:55 - decimal place I give here no 8.03 see
12:06 - round up though it is 0.03 it is going
12:09 - to the next higher value round down is 8
12:12 - as per mathematical role it is 8 now let
12:19 - us test for maximum and minimum function
12:22 - we need to input so let us take from the
12:25 - user this will be B math dot Mac cinema
12:37 - ma X of a comma B then here minimum or a
12:45 - Mayan of a comma D so here let us have
12:51 - maximum that is C minimum of given 2 is
13:04 - B here let us also have the absolute
13:08 - value here so absolute value of let us
13:18 - have B math dot a BS of B so we will do
13:31 - negative value for B to point 3 to
13:44 - another number 4 sorry minus 4 point 1
13:50 - so maximum is 2 point 3 2 so this is
13:54 - positive number this is negative number
13:56 - so this is lesser than this minimum is
14:00 - minus 4 point 1 the absolute value of B
14:03 - is 4 point 1 so this negative value
14:06 - converted into positive value with this
14:13 - let us also create a random number
14:16 - Double R is equal to math dot random off
14:27 - system dot out dot print line off I'll
14:35 - just compile this see it written the
14:50 - greater number the smaller number
14:52 - absolute value of 60 3.0 and 63 itself
14:56 - so this is the second number we have
14:58 - taken for absolute value and then random
15:01 - number is created dear students I hope
15:06 - this is very clear to you how to use
15:09 - math functions in Java program next
15:12 - video tutorial I will teach you how to
15:15 - write Java statements to given
15:18 - mathematical expressions until then
15:21 - thank you students

the square root of a number example here math dot s qrp of 36 this will return six point zero next we have seal of a number this method helps to round up the decimal number to a integer value but gives the output as double value for example we have three hundred twelve point three four this will round to the next higher value of integer maybe here our 3r8 whatever it is that is lesser than

round as per mathematical rule so here we have ninety one point five six if it is five or more than 5 it will round up otherwise we will round down so here as per mathematical rule we have 92 as output next we have ABS of X so this is the absolute value absolute value is the position of a number either left side or right side of the zero in the number line for example if we have a number line like this zero is in middle right side we will have all positive numbers in left side or negative numbers if we take minus three as a number absolute value of this is three that is counter only the position of the number it doesn't matter whether in negative side or positive side so absolute value of minus three becomes three in mathematics we have two vertical lines like this to mention the absolute value if we take one then we will have absolute value of 1 is 1 itself this function will help us to convert negative value into positive value for example if we have minus 72 point three this will become seventy two point three next we have Mei X of two arguments here this will return the greater value of the given two number for example we have five point six and seven point two the greater values seven point two this get returned next we have my enough two arguments this will return the smaller value here this will return eight point two six next we have exp of X this will give the result of X raised to the power e for example we have math dot exp of five next we have log of X this will give large epidemic value of X next we have sine of X this will return sine value of x and then cos cos value of x and then tan tan value of x next we have random off this will not take any argument but it will return any random number with double type now let us test these mathematical functions through a program program to test map functions import Java dot IO dot star plus math class let us declare the variables we should have throws ioexception prompting the user a is equal to 2 double dot parse double of BR dot readline off let me copy these two lines power here it is B so let me have one more variable called just C so we are going to do C is equal to math dot P whoa W of a

s QR t off let me have a itself compile this enter the base say 25 to the power 2 so 25 to the power 2 is 625 square root of 25 is 5 now let us write the code to round off the numbers enter decimal number so here a is going to be a decimal number let me remove this let me remove this also now b is equal to math dot seal of a then C is equal to math dot floor half a then let me have one more value this B D is equal to math dot print off here so I will have here 3 printing statements first we'll print this is SIL so up this roundup so what it will print it is B then here rounded down this C as per mathematical rules just D so let me compile this I am giving him five point six now when it rounds using seal function it will round up so six point zero if it is floor function though it is more than 0.5 it will round to the down value that is 5 will remain this is neglected as per mathematics as this is more than 0.5 it will round up that will become 6 let us have one more example with lesser decimal place I give here no 8.03 see round up though it is 0.03 it is going to the next higher value round down is 8 as per mathematical role it is 8 now let us test for maximum and minimum function we need to input so let us take from the user this will be B math dot Mac cinema ma X of a comma B then here minimum or a Mayan of a comma D so here let us have maximum that is C minimum of given 2 is B here let us also have the absolute value here so absolute value of let us have B math dot a BS of B so we will do negative value for B to point 3 to another number 4 sorry minus 4 point 1 so maximum is 2 point 3 2 so this is positive number this is negative number so this is lesser than this minimum is minus 4 point 1 the absolute value of B is 4 point 1 so this negative value converted into positive value with this let us also create a random number Double R is equal to math dot random off system dot out dot print line off I'll just compile this see it written the greater number the smaller number absolute value of 60 3.0 and 63 itself so this is the second number we have taken for absolute value and then random number is created dear students I hope this is very clear to you how to use math functions in Java program next video tutorial I will teach you how to write Java statements to given mathematical expressions until then thank you students
