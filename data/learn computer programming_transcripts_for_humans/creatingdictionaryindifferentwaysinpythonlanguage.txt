00:14 - hello everyone welcome back in this
00:16 - class we are going to learn different
00:18 - ways to create a dictionary in
00:20 - Python first let us learn creating
00:23 - dictionary using parameters dict is a
00:27 - function or method which will convert
00:30 - the given argument into dictionary here
00:32 - we are going to give the default
00:34 - parameters if you don't know what is
00:36 - default parameters not to worry now we
00:39 - will learn when I we teaching user
00:42 - defined functions now if I have a key
00:44 - and value pair names and their
00:48 - age kirana is equal to 12 see here K is
00:53 - a parameter so we will not put that in
00:56 - the quotation it is not a string so it
00:59 - is a variable
01:01 - Pana is equal to 23 and then one more
01:05 - raka is equal to
01:09 - 16 see there you could see a
01:12 - dictionary creating a dictionary using
01:15 - list of
01:17 - tles n number of items can be created
01:20 - using tles in a list so I create a list
01:25 - here inside this I will be creating
01:28 - tles 5 comma 7 another one 3 comma Ravi
01:35 - another tle
01:36 - here Risha
01:39 - comma
01:41 - 35 see this is a list having many tles
01:45 - as a argument of dictionary so DCT off
01:48 - dictionary has been
01:50 - created we can also give the tle instead
01:54 - of list so let me just copy this same so
01:58 - instead of list it can also so be a tle
02:01 - that means a nested tle it
02:06 - is remember but whatever you give it's
02:10 - supposed to be a key and value pair
02:12 - there is only two elements available in
02:15 - each
02:16 - tle let us execute
02:21 - this creating a dictionary using zip
02:25 - function in a dictionary function we
02:28 - will have zip
02:30 - function here we will have two arguments
02:34 - as
02:35 - tles having equal
02:38 - length so I am creating a tle here 1 2 3
02:42 - 4 5 and then bated with comma another
02:49 - tle 10 20 30 40 50 see both are having
02:56 - the equal length I close the zip
02:59 - function I close the
03:02 - dictionary so now you could see a
03:05 - dictionary having first element is to
03:07 - first element second element is to
03:10 - Second element similar way n number of
03:13 - elements can be given in the tle what
03:16 - happens if it is not of equal length so
03:19 - let us
03:21 - try from the second tle I
03:24 - reduce two values here so now first
03:29 - having and the second having three it
03:32 - will match with the shortest length and
03:34 - then create the dictionary similar way
03:37 - even if it is first one is having lesser
03:40 - and the second one is having the more it
03:42 - will take the
03:44 - shortest creating a dictionary with many
03:47 - keys but with same
03:49 - value here I will be having di do from
03:56 - keys and then I will have many keys as a
04:04 - list for example 2 4 6
04:10 - 8
04:12 - 10 okay the next I need same value for
04:16 - all these keys right I say
04:22 - even then I close
04:26 - this
04:28 - so two is to even 4 is to even 6 is to
04:32 - even similar way it will be creating one
04:35 - value with many keys hope all these
04:38 - methods are very clear to
04:48 - you instead of this list we can also
04:51 - give the tle let us execute with
04:55 - that so I change this list into a
04:58 - tle
05:02 - this also does the same
05:09 - thing I hope all the methods are clearly
05:14 - understood keep watching my channel keep
05:17 - learning keep sharing thank
05:20 - you

[Laughter] hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to learn different ways to create a dictionary in Python first let us learn creating dictionary using parameters dict is a function or method which will convert the given argument into dictionary here we are going to give the default parameters if you don't know what is default parameters not to worry now we will learn when I we teaching user defined functions now if I have a key and value pair names and their age kirana is equal to 12 see here K is a parameter so we will not put that in the quotation it is not a string so it is a variable Pana is equal to 23 and then one more raka is equal to 16 see there you could see a dictionary creating a dictionary using list of tles n number of items can be created using tles in a list so I create a list here inside this I will be creating tles 5 comma 7 another one 3 comma Ravi another tle here Risha comma 35 see this is a list having many tles as a argument of dictionary so DCT off dictionary has been created we can also give the tle instead of list so let me just copy this same so instead of list it can also so be a tle that means a nested tle it is remember but whatever you give it's supposed to be a key and value pair there is only two elements available in each tle let us execute this creating a dictionary using zip function in a dictionary function we will have zip function here we will have two arguments as tles having equal length so I am creating a tle here 1 2 3 4 5 and then bated with comma another tle 10 20 30 40 50 see both are having the equal length I close the zip function I close the dictionary so now you could see a dictionary having first element is to first element second element is to Second element similar way n number of elements can be given in the tle what happens if it is not of equal length so let us try from the second tle I reduce two values here so now first having and the second having three it will match with the shortest length and then create the dictionary similar way even if it is first one is having lesser and the second one is having the more it will take the shortest creating a dictionary with many keys but with same value here I will be having di do from keys and then I will have many keys as a list for example 2 4 6 8 10 okay the next I need same value for all these keys right I say even then I close this so two is to even 4 is to even 6 is to even similar way it will be creating one value with many keys hope all these methods are very clear to you instead of this list we can also give the tle let us execute with that so I change this list into a tle this also does the same thing I hope all the methods are clearly understood keep watching my channel keep learning keep sharing thank you
