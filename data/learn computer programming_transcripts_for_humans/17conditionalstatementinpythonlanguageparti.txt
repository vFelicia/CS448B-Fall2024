00:00 - hello everyone
00:01 - welcome back
00:06 - in this video lesson we are going to
00:08 - learn
00:09 - conditional control structure in python
00:13 - in python selection or decision
00:15 - constructs are implemented using if
00:18 - conditional statement
00:20 - if statement tests a particular
00:22 - condition
00:24 - when the condition gets evaluated as
00:26 - true actions
00:27 - that is the statements or statement in
00:31 - the block
00:32 - are executed
00:35 - when the condition gets evaluated as
00:37 - false
00:38 - the actions that means the statements
00:41 - under this block
00:43 - are ignored
00:45 - so in all the forms of if statement
00:48 - relational and logical operators are
00:50 - used to
00:51 - form the conditions
00:53 - relational logical operators
00:55 - i have already explained in my previous
00:57 - videos if you are not knowing about this
01:00 - you can please visit those videos learn
01:03 - and come back to this here i will give
01:05 - you one example
01:07 - for conditional control structure
01:09 - this is just a real time example on day
01:12 - to day basis just imagine this is a
01:14 - lunch time and then teacher is with a
01:17 - group of students so here the question
01:19 - is
01:20 - did you bring the lunch in the box so
01:22 - how do we use if condition here if yes
01:26 - so this is the statement have it with
01:28 - your classmates the teacher says to the
01:30 - student this is simply if yes
01:34 - in case not yes that is false or that
01:37 - means he didn't bring it
01:40 - then no other
01:41 - options given there so just it is
01:43 - ignored
01:45 - the other way they are here now
01:48 - if and else did you bring the lunch in
01:51 - the box
01:52 - if yes have it with your classmates
01:55 - here now having an option here
01:58 - if not
01:59 - that is go to the cafeteria still it can
02:02 - be elaborated if alif alif and then so
02:06 - many ellipse and else what is this how
02:08 - there may be so many conditions put
02:10 - together for some actions
02:14 - so did you bring lunch in the box
02:17 - yes then have it with your classmates
02:20 - the next condition here do you have
02:22 - enough money if not means then go to the
02:25 - cafeteria
02:28 - so if
02:29 - even the money is not enough do you have
02:31 - less money
02:33 - borrow some from friends see one more
02:35 - condition
02:36 - similar like that we can keep
02:39 - adding the conditions
02:40 - using alif
02:42 - so when none of these conditions get
02:44 - applied and then at last it comes to the
02:47 - last one where it is else so then what
02:49 - is the action here the teacher says i
02:52 - will share my lunch with you come in
02:54 - today's class we are going to see the
02:57 - simple if statement how to use it in
03:00 - python i will also give some example
03:03 - programs for this
03:06 - if else
03:07 - if lflef ladder
03:09 - will be learnt in the next next classes
03:12 - if statement
03:13 - if statement is used to check the
03:15 - situation with conditional expression
03:19 - when the condition gets evaluated as
03:22 - true
03:22 - it carries out the action the syntax for
03:26 - writing give us
03:28 - if see remember this is a key word i and
03:31 - f both are in small letters that is
03:34 - lowercase letters and then the condition
03:37 - is given the condition is in the angle
03:39 - bracket here as a syntax that means the
03:41 - condition keeps changing
03:44 - and then you know any block of
03:45 - statements end with the colon
03:48 - and the next line starts after one
03:50 - indent of space so statement one is
03:53 - given if you have more statements it can
03:56 - also be given you can keep continuing
03:58 - that n number of statements so when the
04:01 - condition is not true and then no action
04:04 - is being taken or no other statements
04:06 - are executed this is simple
04:09 - if statement remember here all these
04:11 - statements under this block so will be
04:14 - with the same indent level once again
04:17 - remember here
04:19 - whatever is given inside the angle
04:21 - bracket is changeable and then whatever
04:24 - is given in the square bracket those are
04:26 - only optional this statement may be
04:29 - there or may not be there
04:31 - here is the flowchart of conditional
04:33 - statement you know condition is given in
04:35 - the diamond box and then when
04:38 - this evaluates true the statements are
04:41 - get executed
04:43 - here we do not have any other
04:46 - statement when it get evaluated false so
04:48 - it directly ends or it continues with
04:50 - the other part of program
04:53 - for example we can say if a is greater
04:56 - than b
04:57 - print a
04:59 - then another statement if i say
05:01 - to print dot dot
05:03 - that's all it prints
05:05 - if false it is not going to do anything
05:07 - else it is going to
05:09 - start with the other part of the program
05:12 - next part of the program come let us go
05:14 - to the python and execute some programs
05:18 - create a python program to accept two
05:20 - variables and print the first
05:23 - if it is greater than the second one so
05:26 - only if the first one is greater than it
05:28 - will print otherwise it is not going to
05:30 - do anything okay that is the program so
05:32 - let us
05:34 - take the input from the user for both
05:36 - the variables say a and b so a is equal
05:40 - to the input we will take that we will
05:42 - convert to integer right so into
05:46 - input of
05:49 - enter
05:50 - your first value
05:59 - then here the second value we will take
06:02 - i copy paste
06:06 - and then right here second value
06:12 - okay so now here is the condition we are
06:14 - going to give
06:16 - if is a keyword with all small letters
06:18 - so if
06:20 - then one space then i will give the
06:22 - condition here if a is greater than it
06:24 - is going to print here that's nothing
06:26 - else
06:27 - if b is greater it is not going to do
06:29 - anything so that is the question given
06:31 - here so if
06:33 - a is greater than b
06:35 - then we end this with colon
06:38 - and then automatically it will leave one
06:40 - indent when i give the enter button
06:44 - so one indent
06:46 - then i say print
06:51 - i may print a or a is greater so a and
06:54 - then if i want to print a is greater
06:57 - than i print here
06:59 - is greater
07:01 - i can also write again print
07:03 - you have successfully
07:09 - learnt
07:11 - if condition
07:13 - program
07:16 - so we need to open that with
07:20 - double quote so this is the
07:22 - prompt simply have given that there are
07:25 - two statements here so let us just run
07:28 - this i save this and then run
07:31 - enter the first value 5
07:34 - second value 7
07:36 - so
07:37 - what it is going to do it is going to do
07:39 - nothing so run once again
07:44 - so now i give 10
07:46 - and then second value is 5 so it is
07:48 - going to print now 10 is greater right
07:51 - 10 is greater and then you have
07:53 - successfully learnt
07:55 - if condition program here is the another
07:57 - question
07:58 - create a python program to print the
08:00 - marks entered is pass marks so
08:03 - the condition is given marks above 39 is
08:06 - considered as pass let me take the input
08:08 - for the marks
08:10 - marks is equal to
08:14 - so
08:15 - in our float we can take
08:18 - float of
08:20 - input of
08:22 - enter your marks
08:27 - so
08:29 - there is only one comparison here if
08:33 - marks is greater than
08:37 - 39 then it is pass right
08:41 - print pass
08:47 - if it is lesser than that it is not
08:48 - going to do anything so that's all the
08:51 - program is very small just three line
08:52 - program so if i say 50
08:56 - pass
08:58 - so if i say
09:00 - 15
09:03 - nothing it does
09:04 - hope this if concept is very clear to
09:06 - you let us meet in the next class
09:11 - until then bye thank you

hello everyone welcome back in this video lesson we are going to learn conditional control structure in python in python selection or decision constructs are implemented using if conditional statement if statement tests a particular condition when the condition gets evaluated as true actions that is the statements or statement in the block are executed when the condition gets evaluated as false the actions that means the statements under this block are ignored so in all the forms of if statement relational and logical operators are used to form the conditions relational logical operators i have already explained in my previous videos if you are not knowing about this you can please visit those videos learn and come back to this here i will give you one example for conditional control structure this is just a real time example on day to day basis just imagine this is a lunch time and then teacher is with a group of students so here the question is did you bring the lunch in the box so how do we use if condition here if yes so this is the statement have it with your classmates the teacher says to the student this is simply if yes in case not yes that is false or that means he didn't bring it then no other options given there so just it is ignored the other way they are here now if and else did you bring the lunch in the box if yes have it with your classmates here now having an option here if not that is go to the cafeteria still it can be elaborated if alif alif and then so many ellipse and else what is this how there may be so many conditions put together for some actions so did you bring lunch in the box yes then have it with your classmates the next condition here do you have enough money if not means then go to the cafeteria so if even the money is not enough do you have less money borrow some from friends see one more condition similar like that we can keep adding the conditions using alif so when none of these conditions get applied and then at last it comes to the last one where it is else so then what is the action here the teacher says i will share my lunch with you come in today's class we are going to see the simple if statement how to use it in python i will also give some example programs for this if else if lflef ladder will be learnt in the next next classes if statement if statement is used to check the situation with conditional expression when the condition gets evaluated as true it carries out the action the syntax for writing give us if see remember this is a key word i and f both are in small letters that is lowercase letters and then the condition is given the condition is in the angle bracket here as a syntax that means the condition keeps changing and then you know any block of statements end with the colon and the next line starts after one indent of space so statement one is given if you have more statements it can also be given you can keep continuing that n number of statements so when the condition is not true and then no action is being taken or no other statements are executed this is simple if statement remember here all these statements under this block so will be with the same indent level once again remember here whatever is given inside the angle bracket is changeable and then whatever is given in the square bracket those are only optional this statement may be there or may not be there here is the flowchart of conditional statement you know condition is given in the diamond box and then when this evaluates true the statements are get executed here we do not have any other statement when it get evaluated false so it directly ends or it continues with the other part of program for example we can say if a is greater than b print a then another statement if i say to print dot dot that's all it prints if false it is not going to do anything else it is going to start with the other part of the program next part of the program come let us go to the python and execute some programs create a python program to accept two variables and print the first if it is greater than the second one so only if the first one is greater than it will print otherwise it is not going to do anything okay that is the program so let us take the input from the user for both the variables say a and b so a is equal to the input we will take that we will convert to integer right so into input of enter your first value then here the second value we will take i copy paste and then right here second value okay so now here is the condition we are going to give if is a keyword with all small letters so if then one space then i will give the condition here if a is greater than it is going to print here that's nothing else if b is greater it is not going to do anything so that is the question given here so if a is greater than b then we end this with colon and then automatically it will leave one indent when i give the enter button so one indent then i say print i may print a or a is greater so a and then if i want to print a is greater than i print here is greater i can also write again print you have successfully learnt if condition program so we need to open that with double quote so this is the prompt simply have given that there are two statements here so let us just run this i save this and then run enter the first value 5 second value 7 so what it is going to do it is going to do nothing so run once again so now i give 10 and then second value is 5 so it is going to print now 10 is greater right 10 is greater and then you have successfully learnt if condition program here is the another question create a python program to print the marks entered is pass marks so the condition is given marks above 39 is considered as pass let me take the input for the marks marks is equal to so in our float we can take float of input of enter your marks so there is only one comparison here if marks is greater than 39 then it is pass right print pass if it is lesser than that it is not going to do anything so that's all the program is very small just three line program so if i say 50 pass so if i say 15 nothing it does hope this if concept is very clear to you let us meet in the next class until then bye thank you
