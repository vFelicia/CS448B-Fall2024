00:00 - [Music]
00:14 - hello everyone welcome back in this
00:16 - class we are going to start learning
00:18 - strings in python
00:23 - a string is a sequence of characters in
00:26 - python it is not only in python most of
00:29 - the language it is same
00:31 - a string is mentioned inside the single
00:34 - or double quotes
00:36 - for example
00:38 - book which is inside the single quote
00:41 - similar way we can also put it into
00:43 - double quote
00:45 - computer language
00:49 - a string with multiple lines is written
00:52 - inside the triple quotes either using a
00:54 - single or double quotes
00:58 - for example
00:59 - a single quote three times it is given
01:02 - in the beginning
01:03 - we are learning string in python
01:05 - language
01:06 - and it is ended with single code three
01:08 - times
01:10 - similar way even we can use double quote
01:13 - three times in the beginning and the end
01:16 - even it may be a single line we can use
01:19 - triple quotes
01:21 - let us know how do we initialize the
01:23 - string
01:25 - general format is here
01:28 - variable
01:30 - that is an identifier
01:32 - assignment operator
01:35 - in the single quote a string
01:38 - example here str1 is equal to
01:42 - cell phone in single quote
01:44 - similar way it can also be given in the
01:47 - double quote
01:48 - variable is equal to string in double
01:51 - quote example string 2 is equal to
01:54 - change in double quote
01:57 - we can also use
01:59 - three times single quote
02:01 - str3 is equal to three times single
02:04 - quote different
02:05 - three times single quote
02:08 - similar way
02:09 - even we can use double quote three times
02:12 - str4 is equal to
02:14 - remote within three times of double
02:17 - quote
02:18 - remember here the code which you are
02:20 - giving in the beginning and the end it
02:23 - should be same
02:25 - you cannot mix single and double
02:27 - together
02:30 - the length of the string is the number
02:32 - of characters present in it
02:35 - for example
02:36 - length of str1 is
02:38 - 9 which is cell phone here
02:43 - note
02:44 - a string enclosed with triple quotes
02:47 - without referring a variable in the
02:49 - program is considered as comment line or
02:52 - comment lines
02:54 - hence it will not be
02:56 - taken as a programming code and get
02:58 - interpreted
03:00 - referring characters in the string
03:04 - for example i have str is equal to
03:07 - learn python
03:10 - each letter is referred with its index
03:12 - number
03:14 - the index number from left to right
03:16 - always starts with 0. here learn python
03:19 - is the example
03:21 - l will be having the index number as 0
03:25 - e is
03:26 - with 1
03:28 - and then so on
03:31 - when it comes to space that is also
03:33 - considered as one character
03:35 - so it will be indicated as
03:38 - 5 here and then p with 6
03:42 - up to 11 here
03:46 - in python even the string in reverse
03:49 - having the index numbers so when it is
03:53 - from right to left it starts always with
03:56 - -1
03:57 - here in example n will have minus 1 as
04:00 - the index number
04:02 - and then o as minus 2 and then
04:05 - so on
04:09 - so at last minus 12 will be the first
04:13 - index number for the example given
04:16 - so the index number of the last
04:18 - character is
04:19 - length of string minus 1 if you take
04:22 - from
04:23 - left to right
04:25 - so the total length will be 12 here
04:28 - 12 characters are present here
04:32 - the last index number is
04:34 - 11 as it starts from 0.
04:37 - if you are counting from
04:39 - right to left and then it will be minus
04:42 - 1
04:45 - position of the character is
04:48 - index number of the character plus 1
04:50 - that is considering index number from
04:52 - left to right
04:54 - note there is no
04:56 - character data type in the python
04:59 - language a single character inside the
05:01 - code is considered as a string with the
05:04 - length 1.
05:08 - let us understand more clearly by
05:10 - executing on python
05:13 - i am using here script mode
05:16 - let me initialize a
05:18 - string
05:19 - say str
05:21 - 1 is equal to
05:24 - python
05:27 - str
05:29 - 2 equal to
05:31 - i put it in single quote now
05:36 - computer language
05:41 - str 3 is equal to
05:43 - i enclosed this with 3 times of single
05:46 - quote
05:47 - 1
05:48 - 2 and 3
05:50 - i write here
05:53 - we are learning
05:54 - and then in the next line i write
05:58 - python
05:59 - string
06:01 - now when i close this again three times
06:04 - of single quote
06:08 - let me print all this
06:10 - print
06:11 - str1 comma str 2 comma str 3
06:18 - if you want to bifurcate into next next
06:20 - lines
06:22 - let me also add here
06:24 - a new line
06:33 - let me execute this
06:37 - so you could see here
06:39 - python computer language
06:41 - we are learning python string
06:47 - in case i mismatch this
06:50 - quote for example i have
06:53 - started with single quote i end with
06:56 - double quote three times
06:59 - so there is an error it shows
07:03 - otherwise
07:04 - i have one double quote and then one
07:07 - single quote which looks like three
07:09 - times of single quote
07:11 - this is also mismatch
07:15 - so you have to match this
07:18 - codes
07:22 - i am just removing all these
07:24 - from here
07:26 - now i will let you know two string
07:28 - functions see actually string functions
07:31 - elaborately we will learn in future
07:33 - classes
07:35 - but here just i wanted to show
07:37 - to understand the length of the string
07:40 - to get the length of the string
07:43 - we use
07:44 - len of the string name or directly
07:48 - string
07:50 - let me print it print
07:52 - len
07:54 - and then open the bracket the string
07:56 - name that is variable i can give str1
08:00 - close this
08:02 - and then close the print one
08:04 - here
08:05 - six letters are there so it should be
08:07 - printing six as the result
08:12 - you can see
08:13 - the same thing
08:15 - now if i want to know
08:17 - the index numbers i have a function
08:19 - called index of
08:21 - print
08:23 - open the bracket the reference string
08:25 - name or string we need to give str1 dot
08:29 - index off
08:31 - whichever letters index you need that
08:34 - letter you can give in the quota
08:36 - for example i give
08:38 - h here
08:42 - so we know the index number of h is
08:45 - three
08:47 - three times code
08:49 - without referring to the variable
08:54 - it becomes the comment line
08:59 - so it will not be interpreted the rest
09:01 - of the things only will work
09:04 - you could see it is working as before
09:08 - thing i put it into a variable called
09:10 - a is equal to
09:12 - then i try to print a here
09:15 - it will be printing
09:21 - if i want to extract the
09:23 - particular character at some index
09:26 - number
09:27 - i just put in the
09:29 - print statement so that it displays
09:31 - print
09:33 - str1
09:34 - open the square bracket and give the
09:36 - index number there for example i give 5
09:40 - and then close this now at 5
09:42 - n is there
09:44 - so the length of this
09:46 - str1 is 6 the last index is 5
09:50 - let me take away these
09:54 - so you could see that n is printed there
09:58 - in case reverse or
09:59 - last character's
10:01 - index number will be minus
10:05 - it is again going to print n
10:11 - the length you take and just add minus
10:13 - to that we giving the first letter
10:17 - let me change this as 6 here
10:22 - so it is b
10:28 - hope the concept is very clear
10:31 - keep practicing and learning
10:34 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to start learning strings in python a string is a sequence of characters in python it is not only in python most of the language it is same a string is mentioned inside the single or double quotes for example book which is inside the single quote similar way we can also put it into double quote computer language a string with multiple lines is written inside the triple quotes either using a single or double quotes for example a single quote three times it is given in the beginning we are learning string in python language and it is ended with single code three times similar way even we can use double quote three times in the beginning and the end even it may be a single line we can use triple quotes let us know how do we initialize the string general format is here variable that is an identifier assignment operator in the single quote a string example here str1 is equal to cell phone in single quote similar way it can also be given in the double quote variable is equal to string in double quote example string 2 is equal to change in double quote we can also use three times single quote str3 is equal to three times single quote different three times single quote similar way even we can use double quote three times str4 is equal to remote within three times of double quote remember here the code which you are giving in the beginning and the end it should be same you cannot mix single and double together the length of the string is the number of characters present in it for example length of str1 is 9 which is cell phone here note a string enclosed with triple quotes without referring a variable in the program is considered as comment line or comment lines hence it will not be taken as a programming code and get interpreted referring characters in the string for example i have str is equal to learn python each letter is referred with its index number the index number from left to right always starts with 0. here learn python is the example l will be having the index number as 0 e is with 1 and then so on when it comes to space that is also considered as one character so it will be indicated as 5 here and then p with 6 up to 11 here in python even the string in reverse having the index numbers so when it is from right to left it starts always with 1 here in example n will have minus 1 as the index number and then o as minus 2 and then so on so at last minus 12 will be the first index number for the example given so the index number of the last character is length of string minus 1 if you take from left to right so the total length will be 12 here 12 characters are present here the last index number is 11 as it starts from 0. if you are counting from right to left and then it will be minus 1 position of the character is index number of the character plus 1 that is considering index number from left to right note there is no character data type in the python language a single character inside the code is considered as a string with the length 1. let us understand more clearly by executing on python i am using here script mode let me initialize a string say str 1 is equal to python str 2 equal to i put it in single quote now computer language str 3 is equal to i enclosed this with 3 times of single quote 1 2 and 3 i write here we are learning and then in the next line i write python string now when i close this again three times of single quote let me print all this print str1 comma str 2 comma str 3 if you want to bifurcate into next next lines let me also add here a new line let me execute this so you could see here python computer language we are learning python string in case i mismatch this quote for example i have started with single quote i end with double quote three times so there is an error it shows otherwise i have one double quote and then one single quote which looks like three times of single quote this is also mismatch so you have to match this codes i am just removing all these from here now i will let you know two string functions see actually string functions elaborately we will learn in future classes but here just i wanted to show to understand the length of the string to get the length of the string we use len of the string name or directly string let me print it print len and then open the bracket the string name that is variable i can give str1 close this and then close the print one here six letters are there so it should be printing six as the result you can see the same thing now if i want to know the index numbers i have a function called index of print open the bracket the reference string name or string we need to give str1 dot index off whichever letters index you need that letter you can give in the quota for example i give h here so we know the index number of h is three three times code without referring to the variable it becomes the comment line so it will not be interpreted the rest of the things only will work you could see it is working as before thing i put it into a variable called a is equal to then i try to print a here it will be printing if i want to extract the particular character at some index number i just put in the print statement so that it displays print str1 open the square bracket and give the index number there for example i give 5 and then close this now at 5 n is there so the length of this str1 is 6 the last index is 5 let me take away these so you could see that n is printed there in case reverse or last character's index number will be minus it is again going to print n the length you take and just add minus to that we giving the first letter let me change this as 6 here so it is b hope the concept is very clear keep practicing and learning thank you
