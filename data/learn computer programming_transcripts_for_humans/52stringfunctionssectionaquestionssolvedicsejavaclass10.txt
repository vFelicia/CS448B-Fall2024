00:00 - welcome back students let us continue
00:03 - using string functions in a single
00:06 - statement convert the following such
00:08 - that the first letter is in uppercase
00:10 - and rest all are in lower case here
00:13 - string s is equal to Rama in are given
00:15 - in mixed case it is indicated to use
00:18 - only string functions so we have to take
00:22 - the first letter and then convert into
00:23 - uppercase to convert to uppercase we
00:26 - know
00:27 - string dot to uppercase we will give and
00:29 - then to change into lowercase leaving
00:33 - the first letter all other letter should
00:35 - be taken then dot to lowercase we
00:38 - supposed to you so how to extract the
00:41 - first letter using string functions we
00:43 - know that we have substring so we can
00:46 - you yes dot substring of 0 comma 1 so
00:52 - that will take only character at index 0
00:56 - and rest it will not take dot to
01:01 - uppercase we can give and then we have
01:04 - to combine that one and other all lower
01:07 - cases so we will you dot concat now we
01:10 - can give yes dot substring of 1 so from
01:14 - starting one rest all will be taken dot
01:18 - to lower case of we terminate I will
01:23 - delete this code and paste that one and
01:25 - also the answer line so we have to print
01:31 - otherwise we will not get the out no I
01:39 - will close this
01:50 - so you can see that it is being
01:53 - converted as we need so we'll go to next
01:59 - question what is the output of the
02:02 - following Java code string M is equal to
02:06 - Mississippi so printing statement m dot
02:11 - last index of I yes so let us write the
02:14 - index number first so we are having
02:19 - index starting from zero to nine we are
02:23 - finding for a combination of I and s
02:26 - combination of I and s available in two
02:29 - places it has been asked to find the
02:31 - last index R so the second time it is
02:34 - available is starting from four so four
02:37 - will be the answer the first letters
02:40 - index only will be given compile this no
02:51 - syntax error so four is right answer let
03:01 - us go to next question what is the
03:04 - output of the following code yes one is
03:08 - given s Java yes two also given as Java
03:11 - string s 3 is equal to new string of s1
03:15 - so here we can see object is Creator
03:20 - system dot out dot print enough s 1
03:23 - equals s 2 so again yes 1 equals s 3 so
03:30 - yes 1 equal to equal to symbol is given
03:33 - that is relational operator and then s 2
03:35 - is given in the nest 1 equal to equal to
03:39 - s 3 ok so here this is a string function
03:46 - it will check whether both are equal or
03:49 - not the output will be boolean type so
03:52 - this will be true both are same it will
03:54 - be true the next one s 1 equals s 3 so s
04:01 - 1 is stored
04:03 - so that is true here yes three is name
04:06 - of the object and then yes one equal to
04:09 - equal to s2 that is also true when it
04:13 - comes to yes one equal to equal to s 3
04:15 - it will be false because yes 3 is name
04:18 - of the object only there so I will
04:24 - select this space that one compile no
04:30 - syntax error so you can see true true
04:37 - true false let us go to the next
04:42 - question what will be the output of the
04:46 - following code so printing statement
04:50 - page number that is a string plus 12
04:52 - plus 2 so only one statement here so by
05:00 - seeing this numericals you will add both
05:04 - and then you will put page number 14 as
05:08 - the answer many times it happens but see
05:12 - page number is the string it cannot add
05:16 - page number under 12 so it will you page
05:21 - number beside that 12 again that with
05:24 - that 2 cannot be added so it will you
05:27 - just beside that so that is the plus
05:29 - symbol is here just concat so we will
05:33 - get page number 1 to 2 as the answer I
05:37 - want to recall about the operator
05:39 - precedence
05:40 - when operators are in the same
05:43 - precedence then associativity rules also
05:47 - there so it will be from left to right
05:57 - let me compile so you can see page
06:05 - number one - - next question which
06:11 - package should be imported in Java
06:13 - program to get input using scanner class
06:18 - inputstreamreader
06:19 - so we already used many times scanner
06:22 - classes in util package so we will write
06:26 - Java dot util and then input stream
06:28 - reader will be Java dot IO next question
06:34 - given a package computer not laptop
06:37 - write a Java statement to import a class
06:42 - named keyboard contained in this package
06:45 - so the package name is computer not
06:48 - laptop and the class contain is keyboard
06:53 - in it so to import this we should write
06:57 - the import statement import so this is
07:02 - the package so we write computer dot
07:05 - laptop then dot the name of the class so
07:09 - that is keyboard and then we terminate
07:13 - next question if character X is equal to
07:19 - M write a Java statement to check
07:22 - whether X is having character if not we
07:25 - have character class to check whether it
07:27 - is character or not
07:29 - so in that we will you character dot
07:33 - each letter of X so whatever is stored
07:37 - in X it will check whether it is letter
07:40 - that is a character so I will delete
07:43 - this yes that so we have to print and
07:50 - then we also need X system dot out dot
07:59 - [Applause]
08:01 - print line off so we need the input for
08:06 - X so character X is equal to let us cue
08:12 - em here
08:16 - compile this no syntax error so we can
08:27 - also use digit let me show that also so
08:31 - if we have int type then we can check in
08:38 - p.m. for example if we check digit so it
08:45 - will be yum miss a character here it
08:48 - will say false so it will be false so if
08:57 - it is a number there for example if I
09:01 - give 8 it should be true now so it is
09:11 - true so here we have given XS integer
09:14 - type but we have enclosed in the single
09:18 - quotation s character still it is having
09:21 - the value of digit so it will you true
09:26 - only this is just for your clarification
09:29 - I showed you let us go to the next
09:31 - question given in PN is equal to 25
09:35 - write a Java statement to convert en to
09:38 - string type to convert into string type
09:41 - from integer so we can give integer dot
09:45 - to string of so in the bracket we can
09:49 - use the integer variable I will copy now
09:58 - so the problem statement int n is equal
10:03 - to 25 was there so how do we know
10:07 - whether it is converted to string type
10:11 - not let us give a printing statement and
10:14 - then we will add something with that
10:17 - system dot out dot print line enough so
10:23 - with this let us add Phi U so if it is
10:27 - not converted then it will give 30 as
10:29 - the answer otherwise it will give 25
10:32 - beside Phi that will become 255 compile
10:37 - this no syntax error you can see 255 as
10:44 - the answer so that is 25 string now then
10:49 - Phi has come beside that let us see next
10:55 - question if string s is equal to 20
10:59 - write a statement to convert to
11:02 - parameter of double data type see here
11:04 - 20 is given inside the quotation that is
11:08 - string type yes to convert into double
11:12 - data type we can have double dot to
11:17 - value of so that is yes inside the
11:22 - bracket here so whatever the value
11:24 - available for that string it will be
11:26 - converted into double value so it will
11:29 - give 20 point 0 as the answer so I will
11:34 - paste
11:42 - so again we have to print this so
11:54 - instead of simply printing let us add
11:56 - something with this already 20 is that
12:00 - 30 I add double data type I'll use
12:02 - something 0.45 compile this it has an
12:11 - error because of this quotation here
12:14 - sometimes we copy from the other
12:16 - application the quotation becomes
12:20 - different so let us give straight
12:23 - quotation compile this no syntax error
12:34 - so fifty point four five so it is
12:37 - converted into double data type it is
12:39 - sure next question write a Java
12:46 - statement to input character using
12:48 - scanner class to use scanner class we
12:51 - know we have to create the object so we
12:53 - will write scanner obj is equal to new
12:56 - scanner system dot in and then to input
12:59 - a character we need first a variable for
13:01 - character vu
13:02 - any variable there is equal to obj dot
13:06 - next up it will take the string so to
13:10 - take only one character we suppose to
13:12 - you dot character at 0 so this will take
13:17 - one single character from the user so I
13:22 - will replace this core so compile this
13:25 - no syntax error so I will run this
13:35 - so here I give yell so you can see that
13:43 - it is taken one input students I hope
13:50 - many type of questions I have given you
13:54 - can also practice questions from other
13:56 - sources are you can also create your own
13:59 - questions to confirm the answer you can
14:03 - run on the Java program having more
14:06 - practice will lead you to get very high
14:09 - score in the exam keep watching my
14:14 - channel even share to others Thank You
14:18 - students

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back students let us continue using string functions in a single statement convert the following such that the first letter is in uppercase and rest all are in lower case here string s is equal to Rama in are given in mixed case it is indicated to use only string functions so we have to take the first letter and then convert into uppercase to convert to uppercase we know string dot to uppercase we will give and then to change into lowercase leaving the first letter all other letter should be taken then dot to lowercase we supposed to you so how to extract the first letter using string functions we know that we have substring so we can you yes dot substring of 0 comma 1 so that will take only character at index 0 and rest it will not take dot to uppercase we can give and then we have to combine that one and other all lower cases so we will you dot concat now we can give yes dot substring of 1 so from starting one rest all will be taken dot to lower case of we terminate I will delete this code and paste that one and also the answer line so we have to print otherwise we will not get the out no I will close this so you can see that it is being converted as we need so we'll go to next question what is the output of the following Java code string M is equal to Mississippi so printing statement m dot last index of I yes so let us write the index number first so we are having index starting from zero to nine we are finding for a combination of I and s combination of I and s available in two places it has been asked to find the last index R so the second time it is available is starting from four so four will be the answer the first letters index only will be given compile this no syntax error so four is right answer let us go to next question what is the output of the following code yes one is given s Java yes two also given as Java string s 3 is equal to new string of s1 so here we can see object is Creator system dot out dot print enough s 1 equals s 2 so again yes 1 equals s 3 so yes 1 equal to equal to symbol is given that is relational operator and then s 2 is given in the nest 1 equal to equal to s 3 ok so here this is a string function it will check whether both are equal or not the output will be boolean type so this will be true both are same it will be true the next one s 1 equals s 3 so s 1 is stored so that is true here yes three is name of the object and then yes one equal to equal to s2 that is also true when it comes to yes one equal to equal to s 3 it will be false because yes 3 is name of the object only there so I will select this space that one compile no syntax error so you can see true true true false let us go to the next question what will be the output of the following code so printing statement page number that is a string plus 12 plus 2 so only one statement here so by seeing this numericals you will add both and then you will put page number 14 as the answer many times it happens but see page number is the string it cannot add page number under 12 so it will you page number beside that 12 again that with that 2 cannot be added so it will you just beside that so that is the plus symbol is here just concat so we will get page number 1 to 2 as the answer I want to recall about the operator precedence when operators are in the same precedence then associativity rules also there so it will be from left to right let me compile so you can see page number one next question which package should be imported in Java program to get input using scanner class inputstreamreader so we already used many times scanner classes in util package so we will write Java dot util and then input stream reader will be Java dot IO next question given a package computer not laptop write a Java statement to import a class named keyboard contained in this package so the package name is computer not laptop and the class contain is keyboard in it so to import this we should write the import statement import so this is the package so we write computer dot laptop then dot the name of the class so that is keyboard and then we terminate next question if character X is equal to M write a Java statement to check whether X is having character if not we have character class to check whether it is character or not so in that we will you character dot each letter of X so whatever is stored in X it will check whether it is letter that is a character so I will delete this yes that so we have to print and then we also need X system dot out dot print line off so we need the input for X so character X is equal to let us cue em here compile this no syntax error so we can also use digit let me show that also so if we have int type then we can check in p.m. for example if we check digit so it will be yum miss a character here it will say false so it will be false so if it is a number there for example if I give 8 it should be true now so it is true so here we have given XS integer type but we have enclosed in the single quotation s character still it is having the value of digit so it will you true only this is just for your clarification I showed you let us go to the next question given in PN is equal to 25 write a Java statement to convert en to string type to convert into string type from integer so we can give integer dot to string of so in the bracket we can use the integer variable I will copy now so the problem statement int n is equal to 25 was there so how do we know whether it is converted to string type not let us give a printing statement and then we will add something with that system dot out dot print line enough so with this let us add Phi U so if it is not converted then it will give 30 as the answer otherwise it will give 25 beside Phi that will become 255 compile this no syntax error you can see 255 as the answer so that is 25 string now then Phi has come beside that let us see next question if string s is equal to 20 write a statement to convert to parameter of double data type see here 20 is given inside the quotation that is string type yes to convert into double data type we can have double dot to value of so that is yes inside the bracket here so whatever the value available for that string it will be converted into double value so it will give 20 point 0 as the answer so I will paste so again we have to print this so instead of simply printing let us add something with this already 20 is that 30 I add double data type I'll use something 0.45 compile this it has an error because of this quotation here sometimes we copy from the other application the quotation becomes different so let us give straight quotation compile this no syntax error so fifty point four five so it is converted into double data type it is sure next question write a Java statement to input character using scanner class to use scanner class we know we have to create the object so we will write scanner obj is equal to new scanner system dot in and then to input a character we need first a variable for character vu any variable there is equal to obj dot next up it will take the string so to take only one character we suppose to you dot character at 0 so this will take one single character from the user so I will replace this core so compile this no syntax error so I will run this so here I give yell so you can see that it is taken one input students I hope many type of questions I have given you can also practice questions from other sources are you can also create your own questions to confirm the answer you can run on the Java program having more practice will lead you to get very high score in the exam keep watching my channel even share to others Thank You students
