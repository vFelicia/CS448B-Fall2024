00:13 - hello everyone welcome back in this
00:16 - class we are going to learn traversing a
00:20 - tle let us directly learn from the
00:23 - python ideal
00:28 - e let us consider this stle v w which is
00:33 - having all the
00:35 - Ws now if we want to Traverse from left
00:39 - to right that is a to U we will be
00:43 - writing a far Loop for I in we can
00:47 - directly give the tle there v
00:53 - w now every time far Loop prints I
00:58 - becomes an element of the tle so first
01:03 - time it runs I is equal to a second time
01:06 - e like that it will be continuing until
01:09 - youu when there is no element there it
01:13 - stops let us just print this if we run
01:16 - this AE IOU one below other will be
01:26 - displayed this can also be done using
01:28 - the range function
01:31 - when we use range function I becomes 0
01:33 - to the 1 before the
01:37 - stop so range Len of v w we can give so
01:44 - that automatically takes the length
01:46 - length will be 1 plus than the last
01:49 - index so automatically it will be
01:50 - stopping at last index that is use
01:54 - index now when we want to print this I
01:56 - is the integer there so so we will write
02:01 - v w in the square bracket I so that it
02:05 - takes that particular index value so
02:10 - this also will give the same
02:16 - result if we want to Traverse from right
02:19 - to left that is u i e a like that then
02:23 - we shall give here it should be starting
02:27 - from the index minus one which is
02:31 - rightmost and then it should be stopping
02:34 - at minus the length so if we give minus
02:39 - Len of it will not take a it will stop
02:43 - at e so we subtract one more from that
02:47 - it
02:48 - goes up to
02:50 - a then the step is must because it is
02:55 - traversing from right to left so here
02:58 - minus one
03:01 - now this will be running from right to
03:09 - left same thing also can be used using
03:13 - the while loop for that we need to
03:17 - create I say index I and D is equal
03:22 - to 0 here we will write while
03:28 - loop
03:30 - while I and
03:32 - is lesser than Len of v
03:40 - w now here instead of I I and D I have
03:44 - given so I change
03:46 - this and then every time we need to
03:49 - increase the index it will not
03:52 - automatically increase as in the for
03:54 - Loop we will increment this I and D+
03:58 - equal to 1
04:00 - so this is from left to
04:07 - right in case we need from right to left
04:11 - we shall give
04:15 - here
04:17 - -1 we shall make this greater than or
04:21 - equal to minus Len of v w and then here
04:26 - we will be decrementing as it is from
04:29 - right to left so I give minus here so
04:32 - this will Traverse from right to
04:37 - left if you need to put it in the same
04:40 - line we can give end equal to and then
04:44 - in the code one comma there and then
04:48 - even a space now it will be printing in
04:51 - the same
04:55 - line hope it was very clear to you all
04:59 - let us meet in the next
05:02 - class thank
05:05 - you

[Laughter] hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to learn traversing a tle let us directly learn from the python ideal e let us consider this stle v w which is having all the Ws now if we want to Traverse from left to right that is a to U we will be writing a far Loop for I in we can directly give the tle there v w now every time far Loop prints I becomes an element of the tle so first time it runs I is equal to a second time e like that it will be continuing until youu when there is no element there it stops let us just print this if we run this AE IOU one below other will be displayed this can also be done using the range function when we use range function I becomes 0 to the 1 before the stop so range Len of v w we can give so that automatically takes the length length will be 1 plus than the last index so automatically it will be stopping at last index that is use index now when we want to print this I is the integer there so so we will write v w in the square bracket I so that it takes that particular index value so this also will give the same result if we want to Traverse from right to left that is u i e a like that then we shall give here it should be starting from the index minus one which is rightmost and then it should be stopping at minus the length so if we give minus Len of it will not take a it will stop at e so we subtract one more from that it goes up to a then the step is must because it is traversing from right to left so here minus one now this will be running from right to left same thing also can be used using the while loop for that we need to create I say index I and D is equal to 0 here we will write while loop while I and is lesser than Len of v w now here instead of I I and D I have given so I change this and then every time we need to increase the index it will not automatically increase as in the for Loop we will increment this I and D+ equal to 1 so this is from left to right in case we need from right to left we shall give here 1 we shall make this greater than or equal to minus Len of v w and then here we will be decrementing as it is from right to left so I give minus here so this will Traverse from right to left if you need to put it in the same line we can give end equal to and then in the code one comma there and then even a space now it will be printing in the same line hope it was very clear to you all let us meet in the next class thank you
