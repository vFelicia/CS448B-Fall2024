00:00 - hello everyone
00:02 - in this class we are going to learn
00:05 - terminologies of
00:07 - structured query language it is more
00:09 - important to know the terminologies of
00:12 - structured query language before we
00:13 - started
00:15 - server
00:16 - will be accepting the request
00:19 - coming over the network according to the
00:21 - request
00:22 - it accesses the database contents and
00:25 - provides the detail to the clients
00:27 - clients
00:29 - connects to the database server and
00:32 - issues queries in predefined format to
00:35 - get the details if we need something
00:37 - we send a query to the server through
00:40 - the client computer giving the queries
00:43 - in predefined format so for that the
00:45 - server will be answering by accessing
00:47 - the database to the client with
00:49 - requester
00:51 - relational terms
00:53 - we know this is a table also called as
00:55 - relation the name is given to this table
00:58 - we know the tables are made up of
01:01 - columns and rows
01:04 - a named collection of data made up of
01:07 - columns and rows having logically
01:09 - related records are called table now
01:12 - here we are having
01:13 - a data in it right each smallest unit in
01:17 - this table so maybe anything you can
01:19 - take the smallest unit which is called
01:23 - data item
01:26 - the smallest unit of named data if we
01:29 - are taking the columns
01:31 - so all these are columns are also called
01:34 - as attributes other name of this is
01:36 - fields so a column containing one type
01:39 - of data so you can
01:41 - see here if you are taking the column
01:43 - one here this is having
01:45 - only the names the id is having only the
01:48 - ids
01:50 - which is integer numbers
01:52 - again age all are having the same data
01:56 - having integer city again all the city
01:59 - names so like this
02:01 - columns will be having one particular
02:04 - data type only
02:07 - these are rows
02:09 - these are also called as
02:11 - tuples we can say record row or tuple a
02:15 - complete information related to the
02:18 - single unit that is content of all the
02:21 - fields of row so you combine all the
02:24 - fields this is a field this is a field
02:26 - this is a field and this is a field
02:28 - all four fields are together called as
02:31 - row which gives a particular detail of a
02:34 - man see here kedar his id his age and
02:38 - then his city next
02:40 - number of columns are called degree or
02:43 - we can also say number of attributes
02:45 - here one two three four so four columns
02:49 - are there degree of this table is 4
02:54 - the number of attributes in the relation
02:56 - determines the degree of the relation
02:59 - similar way if we are counting all the
03:01 - rows there are 5 rows these number of
03:04 - rows are called as cardinality
03:09 - the number of tuples are rows in a
03:12 - relation is called the cardinality of a
03:14 - relation when we need a particular
03:17 - details to be displayed that is
03:19 - extracting the details from this table
03:22 - then it is called view
03:24 - remember the views are not the permanent
03:27 - one just these are extracted from the
03:30 - original table and as we need it will be
03:33 - displaying the details on the
03:36 - screen
03:37 - these extractor details are also
03:40 - tables
03:41 - so table or details are data derived
03:45 - from the base table available virtually
03:47 - to v1 display
03:49 - structural terms let us consider the
03:51 - table having a name called
03:54 - employee in short form i have given emp
03:57 - here are five columns name id phone
04:00 - number agent city if we decide every row
04:03 - to be identified uniquely we have a
04:06 - facility here saying that particular
04:08 - column will not have any repeated value
04:12 - for that we can make this column as
04:15 - primary key column so this will not
04:18 - allow any duplicate entry in it by this
04:21 - way we can identify each row uniquely
04:24 - primary key identifies each row in the
04:28 - table uniquely and then you need to note
04:30 - down this
04:32 - one table can only contain one primary
04:35 - key
04:36 - the primary key must be unique and
04:38 - without null values null values means
04:40 - nothing but empty
04:42 - so that cell cannot be empty even if you
04:45 - see the phone number this also can be a
04:48 - primary key which are all eligible to
04:50 - become a primary key
04:52 - are called
04:53 - candidate keys if you see in this table
04:56 - both the columns are eligible to become
04:58 - a primary key
05:00 - then these are called candidate key the
05:03 - field which can serve as a primary key
05:05 - but we have selected id as the primary
05:08 - key here and then the phone number which
05:12 - is not the primary key which becomes the
05:15 - alternate key now
05:18 - candidate keys which are not primary key
05:21 - are called alternate key there may be
05:23 - many alternate keys in a table
05:26 - if we are considering a other table
05:29 - called salary i have mentioned here sal
05:32 - here phone number is there
05:34 - and department designation salary and
05:37 - name is there
05:38 - so only phone number can be identified
05:40 - as primary key so we make this as
05:43 - primary key here in case we want to
05:46 - extract the details
05:48 - combining both the tables then we can
05:50 - refer similar columns to identify the
05:54 - same value and append the new table as a
05:58 - view for us so here phone number this
06:00 - becomes foreign key for the salary table
06:05 - foreign key is used to link two tables
06:08 - the foreign key is kept in one table and
06:11 - refers to the primary key associated
06:14 - with another table so here in the second
06:17 - table it is a primary key but in the
06:19 - first table phone number becomes a
06:21 - foreign key for the salary table
06:24 - sometimes we can also
06:27 - mention that particular column we cannot
06:31 - be left blank
06:33 - so that means we can mention as
06:36 - not null this ensures that the field has
06:39 - a value
06:41 - sometimes we may require some columns to
06:44 - be checked for a particular range of
06:46 - value at that time we can give the check
06:49 - condition so that it always remain in
06:52 - the range of value which is given in the
06:56 - condition if we want to minimize the
06:58 - errors done by the human when the
07:00 - entries are done the database considers
07:03 - various way for it
07:05 - it is called data integrity so data
07:08 - should be compatible complete and
07:10 - accurate in database
07:12 - this can be achieved through the data
07:15 - types
07:16 - uniqueness and also by referential
07:19 - integrity that is like primary key
07:21 - foreign key and all these these are the
07:24 - main terms to know before starting the
07:26 - structural query language when we
07:28 - perform the queries in the table we will
07:30 - understand this more clearly we will
07:32 - meet in the next class where i will be
07:35 - starting the simple queries for you keep
07:37 - watching this channel keep learning
07:40 - thank you

hello everyone in this class we are going to learn terminologies of structured query language it is more important to know the terminologies of structured query language before we started server will be accepting the request coming over the network according to the request it accesses the database contents and provides the detail to the clients clients connects to the database server and issues queries in predefined format to get the details if we need something we send a query to the server through the client computer giving the queries in predefined format so for that the server will be answering by accessing the database to the client with requester relational terms we know this is a table also called as relation the name is given to this table we know the tables are made up of columns and rows a named collection of data made up of columns and rows having logically related records are called table now here we are having a data in it right each smallest unit in this table so maybe anything you can take the smallest unit which is called data item the smallest unit of named data if we are taking the columns so all these are columns are also called as attributes other name of this is fields so a column containing one type of data so you can see here if you are taking the column one here this is having only the names the id is having only the ids which is integer numbers again age all are having the same data having integer city again all the city names so like this columns will be having one particular data type only these are rows these are also called as tuples we can say record row or tuple a complete information related to the single unit that is content of all the fields of row so you combine all the fields this is a field this is a field this is a field and this is a field all four fields are together called as row which gives a particular detail of a man see here kedar his id his age and then his city next number of columns are called degree or we can also say number of attributes here one two three four so four columns are there degree of this table is 4 the number of attributes in the relation determines the degree of the relation similar way if we are counting all the rows there are 5 rows these number of rows are called as cardinality the number of tuples are rows in a relation is called the cardinality of a relation when we need a particular details to be displayed that is extracting the details from this table then it is called view remember the views are not the permanent one just these are extracted from the original table and as we need it will be displaying the details on the screen these extractor details are also tables so table or details are data derived from the base table available virtually to v1 display structural terms let us consider the table having a name called employee in short form i have given emp here are five columns name id phone number agent city if we decide every row to be identified uniquely we have a facility here saying that particular column will not have any repeated value for that we can make this column as primary key column so this will not allow any duplicate entry in it by this way we can identify each row uniquely primary key identifies each row in the table uniquely and then you need to note down this one table can only contain one primary key the primary key must be unique and without null values null values means nothing but empty so that cell cannot be empty even if you see the phone number this also can be a primary key which are all eligible to become a primary key are called candidate keys if you see in this table both the columns are eligible to become a primary key then these are called candidate key the field which can serve as a primary key but we have selected id as the primary key here and then the phone number which is not the primary key which becomes the alternate key now candidate keys which are not primary key are called alternate key there may be many alternate keys in a table if we are considering a other table called salary i have mentioned here sal here phone number is there and department designation salary and name is there so only phone number can be identified as primary key so we make this as primary key here in case we want to extract the details combining both the tables then we can refer similar columns to identify the same value and append the new table as a view for us so here phone number this becomes foreign key for the salary table foreign key is used to link two tables the foreign key is kept in one table and refers to the primary key associated with another table so here in the second table it is a primary key but in the first table phone number becomes a foreign key for the salary table sometimes we can also mention that particular column we cannot be left blank so that means we can mention as not null this ensures that the field has a value sometimes we may require some columns to be checked for a particular range of value at that time we can give the check condition so that it always remain in the range of value which is given in the condition if we want to minimize the errors done by the human when the entries are done the database considers various way for it it is called data integrity so data should be compatible complete and accurate in database this can be achieved through the data types uniqueness and also by referential integrity that is like primary key foreign key and all these these are the main terms to know before starting the structural query language when we perform the queries in the table we will understand this more clearly we will meet in the next class where i will be starting the simple queries for you keep watching this channel keep learning thank
