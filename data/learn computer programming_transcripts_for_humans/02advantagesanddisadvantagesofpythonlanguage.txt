00:00 - dear students any language you take
00:03 - it will have its own advantages as well
00:06 - as disadvantages
00:07 - similarly we are going to see advantages
00:10 - and disadvantages of
00:12 - python language now advantages python is
00:15 - object oriented programming language
00:18 - a programming language that can model a
00:20 - real world
00:22 - which focuses on object and combines
00:24 - data and functions
00:27 - object oriented programming models
00:29 - complex things as
00:31 - reproducible simple structures
00:34 - easy to use hence it is a high level
00:38 - language
00:40 - don't need to remember system
00:42 - architecture
00:44 - it is programmer friendly learning
00:46 - python syntax is very easy
00:49 - it is interpreted language interpreted
00:53 - mean
00:53 - language which executes
00:56 - line by line so it becomes very easy for
01:00 - finding the errors even it becomes very
01:04 - easy for learner
01:06 - as it checks line by line the error can
01:09 - be caught
01:10 - by the learner in very easy manner
01:14 - it is expressive language countless
01:18 - constructs are available that help in
01:22 - rather than focusing on syntax it is
01:25 - productive
01:26 - the languages simplicity extensive
01:29 - libraries
01:30 - render programmers more productive than
01:33 - language like java c and c
01:37 - it is portable that means
01:40 - once a code is written in any platform
01:43 - that can be taken to other platform to
01:45 - run
01:46 - or to execute so we call it as
01:49 - write once run anywhere free and open
01:53 - source
01:54 - it is freely available that means you
01:56 - don't need to pay for
01:58 - downloading and installing and then even
02:02 - the source code is also available that
02:04 - means you can edit the language
02:06 - according to your convenient and then
02:09 - you can also raise distribute with the
02:12 - own name it is extensible that means
02:15 - a python can be extended to other
02:17 - languages
02:19 - you can write some of your code in
02:22 - language like c
02:23 - plus plus rc in
02:26 - python similarly it is also
02:30 - embeddable that means it is also
02:32 - possible to put your python code
02:35 - in your source code of a different
02:37 - language like
02:39 - c plus plus etc
02:42 - if you see the usage and applications
02:45 - python can be used
02:46 - to web applications
02:51 - create graphical user interfaces
02:54 - database applications system
02:56 - administrations
02:58 - and scripting now let us discuss about
03:00 - disadvantages
03:03 - speed as we already discussed
03:06 - the program is executed line by line
03:10 - so it will be taking lot of time if it
03:13 - is very big program
03:14 - so it is slower than the language
03:18 - which compiles the program full
03:21 - type binding so that means here we are
03:24 - talking about data type
03:27 - python is dynamically typed that means
03:30 - that you don't need to declare the
03:32 - type of variable while writing the code
03:37 - for example say s is equal to computer
03:40 - that is a string
03:43 - again you will be able to change the
03:46 - value of yes with
03:48 - some other data type for example it is
03:50 - given here float value
03:52 - then it becomes very difficult to find
03:54 - the error in the
03:56 - program testing time takes more
04:00 - conversion most of the languages
04:04 - have the strong syntax but python does
04:07 - not
04:08 - this results in difficulty while
04:09 - translating a program into
04:11 - another programming language libraries
04:15 - available in python language does not
04:17 - competent
04:18 - with other programming languages i would
04:21 - like to conclude by saying this
04:24 - there may be some disadvantages but
04:27 - always the popularity speaks python has
04:31 - become
04:32 - more popular nowadays
04:36 - thank you
