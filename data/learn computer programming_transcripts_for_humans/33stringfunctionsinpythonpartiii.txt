00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - foreign
00:15 - in this class we will see all the
00:18 - remaining string functions
00:24 - string dot is title of
00:27 - this will check whether the given string
00:29 - is in the title case that means
00:33 - every first letter of a word supposed to
00:36 - be in capital in title case it is going
00:39 - to check that
00:40 - if it is correct and then it will be
00:42 - returning true for example
00:45 - James Bond you can notice that J and B
00:49 - both are in capital letters so it will
00:52 - be giving true as the result we can also
00:54 - check whether the string given is ending
00:58 - with a particular substring or character
01:02 - for that we are having ends with
01:05 - function
01:07 - for example James Bond dot ends with ND
01:12 - see you can notice that b o n d that is
01:15 - e n d is the last letter there so it is
01:18 - ending with ND it will be giving true as
01:21 - the result
01:23 - similar way we can also check whether
01:25 - the string is starting with some
01:28 - substring or a character
01:30 - for example James Bond dot starts with
01:34 - and then essay so here it is starting
01:38 - with j a not S A so it is going to be
01:42 - false
01:45 - we can also replace
01:47 - any character or a substring in the
01:51 - string with the new string or character
01:54 - for that we are having replace a
01:56 - function here we will have two arguments
01:59 - one is the old string which you want to
02:03 - replace and the
02:06 - second one is
02:08 - the substring or a character which you
02:10 - need to put it for that world
02:15 - for example James replace
02:19 - see I am giving here m e s
02:23 - to replace with k i e so j a k i e will
02:28 - be the result sometimes we may need to
02:31 - remove the character or a substring
02:35 - from the beginning of a string are in
02:37 - the end of the string for that we are
02:40 - having
02:41 - strip of function that we are having
02:44 - three different ways one of that is L
02:47 - strip
02:48 - and then the characters as the argument
02:52 - it will be removing the given character
02:56 - our substring from the left side of a
02:59 - string when I don't give the character
03:02 - it will be removing the white space
03:05 - character is optional when I demonstrate
03:08 - I will be showing that with the
03:10 - character now I have given here space
03:13 - for example
03:14 - so the white space before James is being
03:17 - removed
03:19 - being it is L strip L indicates left
03:22 - similar way we can also have R strip
03:25 - that means right strip
03:29 - the character given can be removed or
03:31 - else it will remove the white space you
03:35 - can notice that Bond and then some white
03:37 - spaces are there
03:39 - dot R strip it removes all the white
03:42 - space right side
03:44 - only bond is given as output
03:49 - if we want to remove from both the sides
03:52 - instead of giving l r r
03:55 - without indicating that we will give
03:58 - strip
04:00 - so string dot strip of
04:03 - will remove
04:04 - the white space when there is no
04:07 - argument when there is a character or
04:09 - substring argument it will remove that
04:11 - you can see here both the side white
04:14 - spaces are there
04:15 - with gems
04:17 - I have given strip of it gives James
04:21 - without any white spaces
04:24 - split is a function which will be
04:28 - returning the list putting all the words
04:30 - as its elements
04:33 - for example James Bond not not 7 dot
04:38 - split of each word that is James as an
04:40 - element Bond as an element not not seven
04:44 - as an element in a list
04:48 - string dot partition of a substring
04:51 - this returns a list but only with three
04:56 - elements that means
04:58 - whatever the substring given to
05:01 - partition will be an element
05:04 - before and after whatever is left over
05:07 - will be other elements
05:09 - for example James Bond not not seven
05:13 - partition here the partition is o n
05:17 - so y n is the middle element
05:21 - previous element will be whatever is
05:24 - before on so James space b
05:28 - and then the last element will be o n
05:32 - after that whatever is available that
05:34 - will be there
05:35 - string dot join off then argument is
05:38 - string iterable
05:40 - this will be joining
05:42 - each member of a stitching iterator
05:46 - after the string so it will be repeating
05:50 - until string iterator gets sent
05:52 - for example serial number
05:56 - is the string Join one two three so here
06:00 - one serial number
06:03 - then two serial number then 3. each
06:07 - character of a string will be appearing
06:10 - before the string until all the elements
06:13 - of string iterable get over
06:15 - let us understand all these string
06:17 - functions more clearly on python window
06:21 - I will demonstrate with different way of
06:24 - inputs so keep watching
06:26 - St 1 is equal to
06:31 - VR
06:33 - learning
06:35 - computer programming
06:40 - now I give
06:42 - ST1
06:44 - dot is title of
06:48 - see title case means every first letter
06:51 - of the word supposed to be in capital
06:54 - letter
06:55 - here it is not there so it will be
06:57 - showing false
06:59 - cst2
07:01 - is equal to
07:05 - W in capital e
07:07 - a in capital r e and then learning
07:12 - okay see L is not a capital s t
07:16 - 2 Dot is take love
07:20 - this is false
07:22 - now let us check for the right one
07:25 - st3 is equal to
07:30 - we are
07:32 - watching
07:35 - YouTube to learn now it is going to be
07:39 - true
07:42 - st3
07:44 - dot is title of now let us check for
07:46 - ends with
07:49 - ST1 Dot
07:52 - ends with
07:55 - I give the argument here
07:58 - it ends with ing right I will give ing
08:01 - here
08:04 - true
08:06 - in case if I give St one dot
08:10 - ends with
08:15 - in
08:16 - even I can give a single letter
08:19 - it is going to be false
08:22 - now yes T1
08:23 - Dot ends with
08:28 - IU learning
08:33 - so this is also not true
08:36 - let me give programming fully ST1
08:40 - dot ends with
08:46 - foreign
08:48 - programming
08:50 - see actually there is a spelling mistake
08:52 - here
08:53 - I have written progo roaming
08:57 - so let me have the same spelling here
09:07 - so it is true
09:20 - let me check for starts with
09:24 - st2 Dot
09:27 - starts with
09:32 - that is we are learning right so let me
09:34 - give here
09:37 - which will be false
09:42 - now let me give the right one st2 dot
09:46 - starts with
09:50 - V
09:54 - is true
09:56 - we can also check whether the given
09:59 - string is available in the substring of
10:02 - the original string for example I have
10:05 - here
10:06 - we are learning
10:08 - Python programming
10:11 - Dot starts with
10:14 - I wanted to check
10:16 - whether it is starting with
10:18 - learn
10:21 - so I am checking from the substring that
10:25 - means I will be giving the range here
10:26 - the index number of L is 7 so I will be
10:30 - giving 7 the ending I will be giving us
10:33 - some 15. so this will be giving true as
10:36 - index number of L is 7 and then it has
10:39 - learn from there now I wanted to check
10:42 - by taking this range whether it ends
10:46 - with REM so I should be knowing that
10:49 - index number of starting and ending of
10:53 - this range
10:54 - I know
10:56 - the starting is 7 and the ending M I
11:00 - will be taking rhodi index I will copy
11:03 - this
11:04 - Dot
11:06 - index of
11:08 - that is the first M so it will be
11:10 - showing the index number of need area
11:14 - so it is 29
11:16 - so now I will be checking ends with
11:19 - I give Ram
11:21 - Ram
11:23 - then I start from 7 see when we give
11:27 - ending number
11:29 - that is not included so we supposed to
11:31 - give 13 stuff 29.
11:35 - so it is true
11:37 - now let us check replace our
11:40 - we will replace the tst1 ST1 is with the
11:44 - error in the programming spelling so I
11:46 - wanted to replace to write one
11:49 - s t 1 Dot
11:52 - replace of g o is the wrong one and then
11:56 - instead of that I will be giving G here
11:59 - see it will be returning the new string
12:02 - it is not going to update the old string
12:05 - because it is immutable
12:09 - so we will check ST1 will be remaining
12:11 - as it is immutable now if we want to
12:14 - replace and store it in s t 1 itself we
12:17 - can also you like the ST1 is equal to
12:20 - so it is replacing and again rewriting
12:23 - into ST1 now it will be storing the new
12:27 - string so let us check now ST1
12:30 - is with right spelling
12:33 - hope you understood this
12:35 - now if I want to strip
12:38 - for example I give programming
12:41 - Dot
12:43 - I will be using L strip
12:47 - of
12:48 - I wanted to just remove Pro so I give
12:53 - here Pro
12:54 - and then close
12:56 - So Pro will be removed and then the new
12:59 - string starts with gramming
13:03 - if I have space before the string
13:07 - like this
13:14 - I don't give anything in the argument so
13:17 - it will be removing the space
13:19 - similar way R strip works for the right
13:22 - side
13:25 - Python and I give some space there and
13:28 - then R strip
13:32 - sorry dot is missing there
13:39 - so now you could see that extra space is
13:42 - removed and only python is there as a
13:44 - string
13:46 - if I want to remove YN from there
13:51 - dot RS
13:53 - Tripp
13:54 - and then I wanted to remove on right so
13:58 - on IQ here
14:00 - it will be removed
14:02 - if I give generally strip without having
14:05 - lrr there it will be removing from both
14:08 - the ends
14:09 - for example I start on
14:13 - python
14:15 - Dot
14:16 - strip of
14:18 - on a u again here
14:21 - so you could see that when is removed
14:24 - from the beginning
14:25 - it starts from the space and also
14:27 - removed from the end
14:30 - let us check the split function
14:33 - string functions are
14:35 - good
14:37 - to learn
14:40 - Dot
14:42 - split off it will be splitting each and
14:45 - every word and put it into a list
14:50 - now partition off
14:59 - dot partition of
15:04 - I want to partition Pion from there
15:08 - before t i y and whatever is available
15:10 - it will be one element Pion is one
15:14 - Element and then remaining
15:17 - space r good will be one element
15:22 - in case if I give partitioning at the
15:25 - beginning itself for example
15:31 - string functions Dot
15:34 - partition of
15:36 - I give string here that is the starting
15:38 - itself
15:39 - so what will be the result of this
15:43 - the beginning will be empty string is
15:46 - the middle one and the ending will be
15:49 - remaining
15:53 - there was a spelling mistake again here
15:56 - so let me Rectify here
16:02 - you could see that beginning is empty
16:05 - and the string is the partition one
16:08 - which we have given and the ending on
16:10 - similar way if we are giving the ending
16:12 - as the partition
16:15 - here I give
16:17 - p i o n s
16:23 - again the faulty one I copied here
16:29 - so this is the right spelling
16:32 - so at the end it is empty
16:38 - now let us check the join function
16:44 - roll number I give
16:47 - then one space I give to bifurcate this
16:51 - Dot
16:52 - join off I give one two three for better
16:55 - understanding
16:57 - one two three so each character is a
17:02 - iterator
17:03 - now I will be
17:05 - seeing one roll number
17:08 - two roll number and then three
17:12 - if I give a space with one two three and
17:15 - then I will be getting 1 2 3 also with
17:18 - roll numbers
17:20 - so I give here one space there
17:24 - you could see that right
17:29 - let us check whether we have executed
17:31 - everything
17:35 - this title ends with starts with replace
17:38 - L strip R strip split partition joint
17:42 - yes we have done everything please keep
17:44 - watching this channel keep learning and
17:47 - also don't forget to share to others
17:49 - those we need so that they also learn
17:53 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

foreign in this class we will see all the remaining string functions string dot is title of this will check whether the given string is in the title case that means every first letter of a word supposed to be in capital in title case it is going to check that if it is correct and then it will be returning true for example James Bond you can notice that J and B both are in capital letters so it will be giving true as the result we can also check whether the string given is ending with a particular substring or character for that we are having ends with function for example James Bond dot ends with ND see you can notice that b o n d that is e n d is the last letter there so it is ending with ND it will be giving true as the result similar way we can also check whether the string is starting with some substring or a character for example James Bond dot starts with and then essay so here it is starting with j a not S A so it is going to be false we can also replace any character or a substring in the string with the new string or character for that we are having replace a function here we will have two arguments one is the old string which you want to replace and the second one is the substring or a character which you need to put it for that world for example James replace see I am giving here m e s to replace with k i e so j a k i e will be the result sometimes we may need to remove the character or a substring from the beginning of a string are in the end of the string for that we are having strip of function that we are having three different ways one of that is L strip and then the characters as the argument it will be removing the given character our substring from the left side of a string when I don't give the character it will be removing the white space character is optional when I demonstrate I will be showing that with the character now I have given here space for example so the white space before James is being removed being it is L strip L indicates left similar way we can also have R strip that means right strip the character given can be removed or else it will remove the white space you can notice that Bond and then some white spaces are there dot R strip it removes all the white space right side only bond is given as output if we want to remove from both the sides instead of giving l r r without indicating that we will give strip so string dot strip of will remove the white space when there is no argument when there is a character or substring argument it will remove that you can see here both the side white spaces are there with gems I have given strip of it gives James without any white spaces split is a function which will be returning the list putting all the words as its elements for example James Bond not not 7 dot split of each word that is James as an element Bond as an element not not seven as an element in a list string dot partition of a substring this returns a list but only with three elements that means whatever the substring given to partition will be an element before and after whatever is left over will be other elements for example James Bond not not seven partition here the partition is o n so y n is the middle element previous element will be whatever is before on so James space b and then the last element will be o n after that whatever is available that will be there string dot join off then argument is string iterable this will be joining each member of a stitching iterator after the string so it will be repeating until string iterator gets sent for example serial number is the string Join one two three so here one serial number then two serial number then 3. each character of a string will be appearing before the string until all the elements of string iterable get over let us understand all these string functions more clearly on python window I will demonstrate with different way of inputs so keep watching St 1 is equal to VR learning computer programming now I give ST1 dot is title of see title case means every first letter of the word supposed to be in capital letter here it is not there so it will be showing false cst2 is equal to W in capital e a in capital r e and then learning okay see L is not a capital s t 2 Dot is take love this is false now let us check for the right one st3 is equal to we are watching YouTube to learn now it is going to be true st3 dot is title of now let us check for ends with ST1 Dot ends with I give the argument here it ends with ing right I will give ing here true in case if I give St one dot ends with in even I can give a single letter it is going to be false now yes T1 Dot ends with IU learning so this is also not true let me give programming fully ST1 dot ends with foreign programming see actually there is a spelling mistake here I have written progo roaming so let me have the same spelling here so it is true let me check for starts with st2 Dot starts with that is we are learning right so let me give here which will be false now let me give the right one st2 dot starts with V is true we can also check whether the given string is available in the substring of the original string for example I have here we are learning Python programming Dot starts with I wanted to check whether it is starting with learn so I am checking from the substring that means I will be giving the range here the index number of L is 7 so I will be giving 7 the ending I will be giving us some 15. so this will be giving true as index number of L is 7 and then it has learn from there now I wanted to check by taking this range whether it ends with REM so I should be knowing that index number of starting and ending of this range I know the starting is 7 and the ending M I will be taking rhodi index I will copy this Dot index of that is the first M so it will be showing the index number of need area so it is 29 so now I will be checking ends with I give Ram Ram then I start from 7 see when we give ending number that is not included so we supposed to give 13 stuff 29. so it is true now let us check replace our we will replace the tst1 ST1 is with the error in the programming spelling so I wanted to replace to write one s t 1 Dot replace of g o is the wrong one and then instead of that I will be giving G here see it will be returning the new string it is not going to update the old string because it is immutable so we will check ST1 will be remaining as it is immutable now if we want to replace and store it in s t 1 itself we can also you like the ST1 is equal to so it is replacing and again rewriting into ST1 now it will be storing the new string so let us check now ST1 is with right spelling hope you understood this now if I want to strip for example I give programming Dot I will be using L strip of I wanted to just remove Pro so I give here Pro and then close So Pro will be removed and then the new string starts with gramming if I have space before the string like this I don't give anything in the argument so it will be removing the space similar way R strip works for the right side Python and I give some space there and then R strip sorry dot is missing there so now you could see that extra space is removed and only python is there as a string if I want to remove YN from there dot RS Tripp and then I wanted to remove on right so on IQ here it will be removed if I give generally strip without having lrr there it will be removing from both the ends for example I start on python Dot strip of on a u again here so you could see that when is removed from the beginning it starts from the space and also removed from the end let us check the split function string functions are good to learn Dot split off it will be splitting each and every word and put it into a list now partition off dot partition of I want to partition Pion from there before t i y and whatever is available it will be one element Pion is one Element and then remaining space r good will be one element in case if I give partitioning at the beginning itself for example string functions Dot partition of I give string here that is the starting itself so what will be the result of this the beginning will be empty string is the middle one and the ending will be remaining there was a spelling mistake again here so let me Rectify here you could see that beginning is empty and the string is the partition one which we have given and the ending on similar way if we are giving the ending as the partition here I give p i o n s again the faulty one I copied here so this is the right spelling so at the end it is empty now let us check the join function roll number I give then one space I give to bifurcate this Dot join off I give one two three for better understanding one two three so each character is a iterator now I will be seeing one roll number two roll number and then three if I give a space with one two three and then I will be getting 1 2 3 also with roll numbers so I give here one space there you could see that right let us check whether we have executed everything this title ends with starts with replace L strip R strip split partition joint yes we have done everything please keep watching this channel keep learning and also don't forget to share to others those we need so that they also learn thank you
