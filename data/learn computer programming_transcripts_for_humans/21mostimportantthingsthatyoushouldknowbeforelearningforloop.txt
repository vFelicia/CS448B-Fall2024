00:04 - hello everyone
00:06 - in this class we are going to learn
00:08 - two important things which are needed to
00:11 - perform a for loop in python program
00:15 - the first one is range of function
00:19 - range of n
00:20 - this is a function which creates a
00:23 - sequence of the integers with n elements
00:27 - it will create from 0 to n minus 1
00:30 - this can also be mentioned as range of 0
00:33 - comma n so here remember n is not
00:36 - included previous to that number itself
00:39 - it will stop
00:41 - so for example
00:43 - range of 6
00:45 - are range of 0 comma 6 when we are
00:48 - giving this
00:49 - python creates
00:52 - a sequence of integers starting from
00:55 - 0
00:56 - and then stops at five the range
00:59 - function can also be with two arguments
01:02 - when we are giving two arguments this
01:05 - will create a sequence of integer
01:08 - from m
01:09 - until n minus one for example
01:13 - if we are giving range of 4 comma
01:16 - 10
01:17 - this will create a sequence
01:21 - 4 5 6 7 8 and 9
01:25 - remember not 10. range of function
01:28 - can also have
01:30 - three arguments
01:31 - say l m and n it creates a sequence of
01:35 - integer from
01:36 - l to m minus 1
01:38 - so here n will be the steps for example
01:44 - if i have range of 1 comma 10 comma 3
01:48 - what happens
01:49 - it will start from 1 it will end by 9
01:53 - but the steps given to it is if we take
01:56 - a number line like this one is starting
01:59 - and then two and three are skipped and
02:02 - then it jumps to four and then
02:05 - it jumps to third step that is 7
02:09 - then after 7 it should go to 10
02:12 - but 10 is not included so it stops by 7
02:16 - the sequence will be 1 4 and 7
02:19 - when we are having only two arguments
02:22 - that is the second one four comma 10
02:25 - how it acts the steps by default it
02:28 - takes as plus one
02:31 - so this is the meaning so it is four
02:34 - five six 7 8 and 9.
02:38 - the next important thing is
02:40 - in and not in operators
02:43 - with range of function
02:45 - in operator checks whether the mentioned
02:48 - integer is in the given range of
02:50 - integers
02:52 - and returns boolean value accordingly
02:56 - similarly not in operator
02:59 - checks whether the mentioned integer is
03:02 - not in the given range of integers and
03:04 - returns
03:05 - boolean value accordingly
03:08 - for example
03:10 - 14 in range
03:12 - 8 comma 20 comma 2 this means the
03:15 - elements are
03:17 - 8 10 12 14 16 and 18. so whether 14 is
03:21 - there in this range or not yes it is
03:24 - true so it will return true the next
03:26 - example 3 in range 12 comma 1 comma
03:29 - minus 2
03:31 - here the step value given as minus 2 the
03:34 - elements should be 12 10 8
03:37 - 6 4 2 3 is not available in that so it
03:41 - will return
03:42 - false the next example for not it one
03:46 - not in range eight
03:48 - see eight means it starts from zero and
03:51 - then ends at seven so one is there you
03:54 - are checking not in so it is false
03:57 - one more example three not in range
03:59 - minus 6 comma 0
04:01 - the elements will be
04:03 - minus 6 minus 5 minus 4 minus 3 minus 2
04:07 - minus 1
04:08 - 3 will not be there
04:11 - so this is
04:12 - true
04:13 - let me execute and show all these let me
04:16 - give x is equal to
04:18 - range of 7 it should be 0 to 6th right
04:22 - so if i ask what is x then it says
04:25 - 0 comma 7
04:27 - but how do we know
04:29 - elements are created let us put this
04:31 - into
04:32 - list just i say
04:34 - list of
04:35 - x
04:36 - so you can see 0 to 6 is
04:39 - created as list similar way
04:42 - range of 10 comma 20 iq
04:46 - then just i convert directly into list
04:48 - you can see from 10 to 19. so far we
04:51 - have not seen list but just understand
04:54 - for time being that list of elements are
04:57 - put into square bracket becomes listing
05:00 - python
05:01 - elements are separated with comma we
05:03 - will see elaborately list in future
05:05 - lessons so let me check with three
05:07 - arguments
05:09 - list of
05:10 - range of 5 comma 25 comma 3
05:15 - see it starts from 5 6 7 it will not
05:18 - take 8 it will take then 11
05:21 - like that it will be going until 24 so
05:24 - that means not exactly 24 before that
05:26 - whatever element comes
05:28 - it stops there
05:30 - so you can see that 23 is the last
05:33 - element so now similar way let us check
05:36 - some negative integers
05:38 - list of
05:39 - range of minus 50 comma 6 i give
05:44 - let me give list of
05:47 - range of
05:49 - minus 20 comma
05:52 - minus 25 what will happen now see here
05:56 - from minus again it is going in negative
05:59 - way so it is not incrementing it is
06:01 - decrementing this cannot happen because
06:04 - the third argument by default it is plus
06:07 - 1 not minus 1 correct so let us check so
06:10 - there are no elements put it into it if
06:12 - i give same thing list of
06:15 - range of
06:17 - minus 20
06:18 - comma minus 25
06:20 - comma minus 1
06:23 - it will go up to now
06:25 - minus 24 okay let us check in and
06:28 - not e so 5
06:30 - in
06:30 - range 10 i say so that is 0 to 9 right
06:34 - it will be true if i say
06:36 - minus 20
06:38 - in range 2 comma 5
06:41 - that should be false now let me check
06:44 - minus 20
06:45 - not in range
06:47 - 2 comma 5 it is not there so it will
06:50 - show us true
06:52 - t
06:54 - not in
06:56 - range 10 comma 100 the step is 5 so 50
07:00 - is included right it says not in range
07:02 - so it will be false
07:05 - i hope you are clear in this concept let
07:07 - us meet in the next class learning for
07:10 - loop
07:11 - thank you all

hello everyone in this class we are going to learn two important things which are needed to perform a for loop in python program the first one is range of function range of n this is a function which creates a sequence of the integers with n elements it will create from 0 to n minus 1 this can also be mentioned as range of 0 comma n so here remember n is not included previous to that number itself it will stop so for example range of 6 are range of 0 comma 6 when we are giving this python creates a sequence of integers starting from 0 and then stops at five the range function can also be with two arguments when we are giving two arguments this will create a sequence of integer from m until n minus one for example if we are giving range of 4 comma 10 this will create a sequence 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 remember not 10. range of function can also have three arguments say l m and n it creates a sequence of integer from l to m minus 1 so here n will be the steps for example if i have range of 1 comma 10 comma 3 what happens it will start from 1 it will end by 9 but the steps given to it is if we take a number line like this one is starting and then two and three are skipped and then it jumps to four and then it jumps to third step that is 7 then after 7 it should go to 10 but 10 is not included so it stops by 7 the sequence will be 1 4 and 7 when we are having only two arguments that is the second one four comma 10 how it acts the steps by default it takes as plus one so this is the meaning so it is four five six 7 8 and 9. the next important thing is in and not in operators with range of function in operator checks whether the mentioned integer is in the given range of integers and returns boolean value accordingly similarly not in operator checks whether the mentioned integer is not in the given range of integers and returns boolean value accordingly for example 14 in range 8 comma 20 comma 2 this means the elements are 8 10 12 14 16 and 18. so whether 14 is there in this range or not yes it is true so it will return true the next example 3 in range 12 comma 1 comma minus 2 here the step value given as minus 2 the elements should be 12 10 8 6 4 2 3 is not available in that so it will return false the next example for not it one not in range eight see eight means it starts from zero and then ends at seven so one is there you are checking not in so it is false one more example three not in range minus 6 comma 0 the elements will be minus 6 minus 5 minus 4 minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 3 will not be there so this is true let me execute and show all these let me give x is equal to range of 7 it should be 0 to 6th right so if i ask what is x then it says 0 comma 7 but how do we know elements are created let us put this into list just i say list of x so you can see 0 to 6 is created as list similar way range of 10 comma 20 iq then just i convert directly into list you can see from 10 to 19. so far we have not seen list but just understand for time being that list of elements are put into square bracket becomes listing python elements are separated with comma we will see elaborately list in future lessons so let me check with three arguments list of range of 5 comma 25 comma 3 see it starts from 5 6 7 it will not take 8 it will take then 11 like that it will be going until 24 so that means not exactly 24 before that whatever element comes it stops there so you can see that 23 is the last element so now similar way let us check some negative integers list of range of minus 50 comma 6 i give let me give list of range of minus 20 comma minus 25 what will happen now see here from minus again it is going in negative way so it is not incrementing it is decrementing this cannot happen because the third argument by default it is plus 1 not minus 1 correct so let us check so there are no elements put it into it if i give same thing list of range of minus 20 comma minus 25 comma minus 1 it will go up to now minus 24 okay let us check in and not e so 5 in range 10 i say so that is 0 to 9 right it will be true if i say minus 20 in range 2 comma 5 that should be false now let me check minus 20 not in range 2 comma 5 it is not there so it will show us true t not in range 10 comma 100 the step is 5 so 50 is included right it says not in range so it will be false i hope you are clear in this concept let us meet in the next class learning for loop thank you all
