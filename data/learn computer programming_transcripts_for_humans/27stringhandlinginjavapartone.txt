00:03 - welcome back students in this video
00:06 - lesson we are going to see string
00:07 - handling let us now see string class
00:12 - creating string a string is a reference
00:15 - data type so the variable yes I have
00:17 - taken string s is equal to keyboard
00:20 - inside the double quotation and I
00:22 - terminated so this is the way of
00:24 - initializing the string variable string
00:28 - object string STR here STR is the object
00:34 - name that is a valid identifier can be
00:37 - anything equal to new keyword we use and
00:39 - then string of mouse I have given inside
00:41 - the double quotation where the most
00:43 - store in the string object called y-str
00:47 - next string buffer class creating string
00:52 - buffer object string buffer yes b1 is
00:55 - equal to new string buffer off here yes
00:58 - b1 string buffer object has been created
01:00 - nothing will be stored in this next
01:03 - string buffer
01:04 - yes b2 is equal to new string buffer off
01:07 - Joystiq I have given in the double
01:08 - quotation we're in the SB to object
01:12 - Joystiq has been stored the third way
01:15 - yes b3 is equal to new string buffer of
01:18 - 20 here 20 is the integer number
01:22 - it creates an object where it can store
01:25 - 20 characters in Java there are many
01:28 - functions for the string let us see one
01:31 - by one the function here length of so
01:35 - what will be the output data type always
01:38 - it will be integer the length says how
01:41 - many characters are available in the
01:42 - string including the special character
01:45 - our space so here output data type is
01:49 - int for example I have given here
01:53 - keychain there is a space between key
01:55 - and chain which is in the double
01:57 - quotation Bo dot length of so here it
02:00 - will count all the characters available
02:03 - in it 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so 9 will be the
02:08 - output next to upper case of here there
02:13 - put data type will be string only the
02:17 - function example here dr dot to
02:21 - uppercase of see here d is already there
02:23 - capital r IV is in small letter so which
02:26 - are all in small going to be converted
02:29 - into uppercase so then the output will
02:31 - be dr i ve in all in capital letters
02:34 - next to lowercase off the output of this
02:38 - also be string type for example I have
02:42 - taken monitor here to lowercase off it
02:46 - will be giving this monitor in the lower
02:49 - case the next one re place of world
02:54 - character dot new character that means
02:55 - we are going to give a character which
02:58 - is available in the string and then we
03:00 - are going to change into the new
03:01 - character which we want to replace so
03:05 - again the output data type will be
03:07 - string itself here for example I have
03:10 - given store dot replace whoa comma a Co
03:15 - is a letter here that is a character so
03:17 - it is been in single quotation same like
03:21 - that ei is also given in this single
03:23 - quotation so the output will be boy is
03:26 - being replaced with a so it will be
03:29 - stare next trim off here the output data
03:35 - type again is string type for example I
03:39 - have given some space
03:40 - I love Java then again some more space
03:45 - what it does it will cut all the extra
03:49 - spaces before and after the string so
03:52 - that means it starts from I and then it
03:55 - ends with ei the extra space before and
03:59 - after the string going to be trimmed up
04:01 - next can't cut off concat is going to be
04:06 - string type output here for example key
04:10 - which is given inside the double
04:11 - quotation that is first string and then
04:14 - concat off board I have given again in
04:18 - the double quotation here these two are
04:22 - going to be added together which is
04:25 - going to display nearby
04:27 - so keyboard will be the output then
04:32 - value of so this is also going to be
04:35 - string type the function here example
04:38 - string dot value of 32 so 32 is a
04:42 - integer number here please note that o
04:46 - is capital value all in small and then
04:49 - whoa is capital e effacing small letter
04:51 - so the integer value going to be
04:54 - converted into string value that is just
04:57 - 3/2 as they object here there are many
05:01 - string functions in this class we will
05:03 - see only this much we will continue that
05:05 - in the next class now I will demonstrate
05:08 - all these string functions through a
05:11 - Java program string STR is equal to I
05:17 - just give here mirror let me take a
05:24 - length of this so I need a variable
05:28 - integer variable so that is into L is
05:30 - equal to STR dot length of so let me
05:37 - print this
05:51 - Plus Yelp now let me also convert into
06:00 - uppercase so I can store this in the new
06:06 - variable after converting into uppercase
06:08 - otherwise directly I can print so let me
06:11 - assign to a new variable string str2 IU
06:17 - is equal to STR dot to you is in capital
06:23 - upper and then KC is in capital
06:27 - so now STR - becomes uppercase of mirror
06:32 - let me print this also in uppercase this
06:46 - just for reference I am giving so that
06:49 - is STR - after converting into uppercase
06:52 - it is going to print let me convert one
06:55 - more string into lowercase system dot
06:59 - out dot print line enough I am just
07:04 - giving here this is my book dot to
07:14 - lowercase of yelling should be capital
07:18 - then C should be capital lowercase F so
07:22 - now this is going to convert this is my
07:24 - book into lowercase C at this is in
07:29 - small all other things are in capital so
07:32 - let us compile then run this so you can
07:39 - see here length of the string is 6 in
07:41 - uppercase so a mirror we came in
07:43 - uppercase this is my book so this asks
07:46 - already in the small letters all others
07:49 - were in big letters so it has been
07:50 - converted into small at us the next we
07:53 - are going to see here is replacer
07:58 - so let us say we place any of the string
08:01 - with the other letter what I will do
08:05 - here system dot out dot print line off I
08:12 - will give here snow snow dot replace
08:20 - half a world character to be given here
08:23 - yes I change this here in single quote
08:27 - yes and then comma instead of that I
08:31 - change it to K so capital K so now the
08:35 - yes letter is being changed into K so it
08:39 - is going to be printed we don't need all
08:41 - these things let me remove this so
08:47 - compile this so you can see there yes n
08:54 - what W become K n roll doubly so let us
08:59 - learn about trim function now I will you
09:02 - here string STR is equal to with some
09:08 - space I give snow now system dot out dot
09:19 - print line off I am going to print STR
09:26 - next let me take this without space that
09:34 - is trimming it I pasted that same here
09:39 - and then hey here I go dot trim off so
09:45 - what it will do first it is going to
09:47 - print the original string here with the
09:50 - space and the next it is going to print
09:53 - after trimming it if I give space after
09:55 - this we can't understand but we can
09:58 - understand whether there is space
09:59 - previous to the string or not let us
10:03 - compile this
10:08 - so you can see that the extra space here
10:11 - is been cut let us give a lengthy string
10:22 - Snow is cool so it is going to cut to
10:30 - only the space after and before not
10:34 - which is in between so in between
10:36 - whatever is there it is going to stay
10:38 - like that next let us see the concat
10:43 - function I will add one more string with
10:47 - the STR so let me do like this system
10:52 - dot out dot print line of st r dot
11:01 - concat with if we take it in the handle
11:10 - let me cut this I will take this also
11:13 - so with this STR one it is going to add
11:16 - if we take it in the hand compile this
11:27 - so snow is cool if we take it in the
11:30 - hand it is displayed together now let us
11:37 - learn value of function let me take in n
11:42 - is equal to 45 so let me print this
11:47 - system dot out dot print line off after
11:53 - converting into string so that is string
11:58 - dot value of ricean now this is going to
12:05 - be converted into string value it is not
12:07 - going to be integer value how we can
12:09 - know this after converting this we won't
12:12 - be able to add any number with this for
12:15 - example I add just 10 with this if it is
12:19 - a number then it is going to be 50
12:21 - fight if it has been converted into
12:23 - strength ten is going to appear nearby
12:26 - let us compile and check see here it has
12:34 - been converted into string so it is been
12:37 - displayed and the near weight n is been
12:39 - displayed students I hope this was very
12:42 - helpful for you to learn the string
12:45 - functions let us continue the second
12:47 - part in the next video until then thank
12:50 - you students

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back students in this video lesson we are going to see string handling let us now see string class creating string a string is a reference data type so the variable yes I have taken string s is equal to keyboard inside the double quotation and I terminated so this is the way of initializing the string variable string object string STR here STR is the object name that is a valid identifier can be anything equal to new keyword we use and then string of mouse I have given inside the double quotation where the most store in the string object called ystr next string buffer class creating string buffer object string buffer yes b1 is equal to new string buffer off here yes b1 string buffer object has been created nothing will be stored in this next string buffer yes b2 is equal to new string buffer off Joystiq I have given in the double quotation we're in the SB to object Joystiq has been stored the third way yes b3 is equal to new string buffer of 20 here 20 is the integer number it creates an object where it can store 20 characters in Java there are many functions for the string let us see one by one the function here length of so what will be the output data type always it will be integer the length says how many characters are available in the string including the special character our space so here output data type is int for example I have given here keychain there is a space between key and chain which is in the double quotation Bo dot length of so here it will count all the characters available in it 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so 9 will be the output next to upper case of here there put data type will be string only the function example here dr dot to uppercase of see here d is already there capital r IV is in small letter so which are all in small going to be converted into uppercase so then the output will be dr i ve in all in capital letters next to lowercase off the output of this also be string type for example I have taken monitor here to lowercase off it will be giving this monitor in the lower case the next one re place of world character dot new character that means we are going to give a character which is available in the string and then we are going to change into the new character which we want to replace so again the output data type will be string itself here for example I have given store dot replace whoa comma a Co is a letter here that is a character so it is been in single quotation same like that ei is also given in this single quotation so the output will be boy is being replaced with a so it will be stare next trim off here the output data type again is string type for example I have given some space I love Java then again some more space what it does it will cut all the extra spaces before and after the string so that means it starts from I and then it ends with ei the extra space before and after the string going to be trimmed up next can't cut off concat is going to be string type output here for example key which is given inside the double quotation that is first string and then concat off board I have given again in the double quotation here these two are going to be added together which is going to display nearby so keyboard will be the output then value of so this is also going to be string type the function here example string dot value of 32 so 32 is a integer number here please note that o is capital value all in small and then whoa is capital e effacing small letter so the integer value going to be converted into string value that is just 3/2 as they object here there are many string functions in this class we will see only this much we will continue that in the next class now I will demonstrate all these string functions through a Java program string STR is equal to I just give here mirror let me take a length of this so I need a variable integer variable so that is into L is equal to STR dot length of so let me print this Plus Yelp now let me also convert into uppercase so I can store this in the new variable after converting into uppercase otherwise directly I can print so let me assign to a new variable string str2 IU is equal to STR dot to you is in capital upper and then KC is in capital so now STR becomes uppercase of mirror let me print this also in uppercase this just for reference I am giving so that is STR after converting into uppercase it is going to print let me convert one more string into lowercase system dot out dot print line enough I am just giving here this is my book dot to lowercase of yelling should be capital then C should be capital lowercase F so now this is going to convert this is my book into lowercase C at this is in small all other things are in capital so let us compile then run this so you can see here length of the string is 6 in uppercase so a mirror we came in uppercase this is my book so this asks already in the small letters all others were in big letters so it has been converted into small at us the next we are going to see here is replacer so let us say we place any of the string with the other letter what I will do here system dot out dot print line off I will give here snow snow dot replace half a world character to be given here yes I change this here in single quote yes and then comma instead of that I change it to K so capital K so now the yes letter is being changed into K so it is going to be printed we don't need all these things let me remove this so compile this so you can see there yes n what W become K n roll doubly so let us learn about trim function now I will you here string STR is equal to with some space I give snow now system dot out dot print line off I am going to print STR next let me take this without space that is trimming it I pasted that same here and then hey here I go dot trim off so what it will do first it is going to print the original string here with the space and the next it is going to print after trimming it if I give space after this we can't understand but we can understand whether there is space previous to the string or not let us compile this so you can see that the extra space here is been cut let us give a lengthy string Snow is cool so it is going to cut to only the space after and before not which is in between so in between whatever is there it is going to stay like that next let us see the concat function I will add one more string with the STR so let me do like this system dot out dot print line of st r dot concat with if we take it in the handle let me cut this I will take this also so with this STR one it is going to add if we take it in the hand compile this so snow is cool if we take it in the hand it is displayed together now let us learn value of function let me take in n is equal to 45 so let me print this system dot out dot print line off after converting into string so that is string dot value of ricean now this is going to be converted into string value it is not going to be integer value how we can know this after converting this we won't be able to add any number with this for example I add just 10 with this if it is a number then it is going to be 50 fight if it has been converted into strength ten is going to appear nearby let us compile and check see here it has been converted into string so it is been displayed and the near weight n is been displayed students I hope this was very helpful for you to learn the string functions let us continue the second part in the next video until then thank you students
