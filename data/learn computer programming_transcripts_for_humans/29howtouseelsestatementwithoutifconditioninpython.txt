00:14 - hello everyone welcome back in this
00:16 - class we are going to discuss about loop
00:19 - else statement in python
00:23 - python allows the else block associated
00:26 - with the loop
00:30 - the else block gets executed only when
00:33 - the loop completes all the iterations
00:36 - that is when exits normally and not when
00:39 - gets terminated by the break statement
00:42 - the general format is here
00:45 - for loop
00:46 - for variable in sequence
00:48 - statement 1
00:50 - statement 2 and then else block for
00:54 - for loop
00:55 - if you see here the indentation is same
00:58 - as
00:59 - where the far starts
01:01 - here again the statements 3 and 4
01:04 - outside the for loop if any statements
01:06 - to be given it can also be given
01:10 - similar way even in the while loop
01:12 - while condition
01:14 - statement 1 statement 2
01:16 - and then else block the indentation is
01:18 - again same as while and then
01:20 - statement 3 and 4 are there statement 5
01:23 - is outside the while loop let us
01:26 - understand
01:27 - these by some example programs
01:32 - for
01:33 - i in range
01:35 - simply i give 1 comma 10
01:41 - print i
01:43 - now else statement for this for loop
01:46 - the indentation is same as
01:48 - for so i go back and then else
01:51 - i just print a statement again print
01:55 - i comma
01:58 - is the last value of
02:01 - i
02:05 - let me execute this
02:08 - so you could see after printing 1 to 9
02:11 - the else statement is executed it
02:14 - printed 9 is the value of i
02:19 - now let me show you if the break
02:22 - statement is given
02:24 - and then this else part will not be
02:26 - executed
02:27 - so i introduce the else statement with
02:30 - some condition here
02:34 - if imod
02:37 - 5
02:38 - is equal to 0
02:42 - then i say break
02:44 - when it comes 5 the condition is true
02:46 - and then it breaks
02:48 - so the else statement will not get
02:50 - executed at that time
02:53 - you could see here
02:56 - now let me change this value instead of
02:58 - 5 i give 11
03:01 - the number which is greater than the
03:04 - range value
03:05 - so this condition is not met true for
03:08 - even a single time
03:11 - then the loop will be getting terminated
03:13 - normally
03:14 - then the else part will be executed let
03:17 - us check this
03:19 - so you could see again
03:21 - when the break statement is present but
03:23 - still it is not meeting the condition
03:26 - required
03:27 - the else part is executed
03:32 - us also execute the while loop program
03:40 - i initialize
03:41 - x is equal to 1
03:44 - while
03:45 - now i give x is lesser than six
03:48 - print x
03:49 - then i need to increment this x
03:52 - plus equal to one
03:55 - now else part for
03:57 - while
03:59 - else
04:01 - print
04:03 - x comma
04:06 - is the last value of x
04:16 - so it printed as it is and then
04:19 - the else part is executed
04:22 - now again when i give the break
04:24 - statement here
04:27 - if
04:28 - x
04:29 - mod 3 equal to 0 i q
04:33 - then i break this now let us check
04:38 - so 1 2 3 and then the else part is not
04:41 - executed
04:43 - similar way if i increase the number
04:45 - which is greater than
04:47 - 6 or even equal to 6
04:51 - the loop get terminated normally not
04:54 - with the break statement so the else
04:56 - part will get executed
04:58 - you could see it
05:00 - hope the concept is clear
05:03 - keep watching my channel keep learning
05:07 - thank you

hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to discuss about loop else statement in python python allows the else block associated with the loop the else block gets executed only when the loop completes all the iterations that is when exits normally and not when gets terminated by the break statement the general format is here for loop for variable in sequence statement 1 statement 2 and then else block for for loop if you see here the indentation is same as where the far starts here again the statements 3 and 4 outside the for loop if any statements to be given it can also be given similar way even in the while loop while condition statement 1 statement 2 and then else block the indentation is again same as while and then statement 3 and 4 are there statement 5 is outside the while loop let us understand these by some example programs for i in range simply i give 1 comma 10 print i now else statement for this for loop the indentation is same as for so i go back and then else i just print a statement again print i comma is the last value of i let me execute this so you could see after printing 1 to 9 the else statement is executed it printed 9 is the value of i now let me show you if the break statement is given and then this else part will not be executed so i introduce the else statement with some condition here if imod 5 is equal to 0 then i say break when it comes 5 the condition is true and then it breaks so the else statement will not get executed at that time you could see here now let me change this value instead of 5 i give 11 the number which is greater than the range value so this condition is not met true for even a single time then the loop will be getting terminated normally then the else part will be executed let us check this so you could see again when the break statement is present but still it is not meeting the condition required the else part is executed us also execute the while loop program i initialize x is equal to 1 while now i give x is lesser than six print x then i need to increment this x plus equal to one now else part for while else print x comma is the last value of x so it printed as it is and then the else part is executed now again when i give the break statement here if x mod 3 equal to 0 i q then i break this now let us check so 1 2 3 and then the else part is not executed similar way if i increase the number which is greater than 6 or even equal to 6 the loop get terminated normally not with the break statement so the else part will get executed you could see it hope the concept is clear keep watching my channel keep learning thank you
