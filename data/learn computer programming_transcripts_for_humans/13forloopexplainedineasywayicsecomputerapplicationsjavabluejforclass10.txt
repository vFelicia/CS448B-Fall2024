00:00 - hello students welcome back today we are
00:04 - going to see iteration grow loops the
00:10 - iteration statements allow a set of
00:12 - instruction to be performed repeatedly
00:16 - until a certain condition is fulfilled
00:21 - iteration statements are also called
00:23 - loop are looping statements Java
00:29 - provides three kinds of loops
00:32 - the first one is far loop second one is
00:37 - wide loop
00:38 - the third is do-while loop in this
00:44 - session we are going to see simple for
00:48 - loop let us create a program
01:34 - every loop has its elements that control
01:38 - its execution generally loop has four
01:43 - elements first Tony's initialization and
01:48 - control variable the next one is test
01:54 - condition the third one is body of the
01:57 - loop and you can say the fourth one is
02:01 - step value let us have a variable count
02:05 - ie in type so we are going to see here
02:12 - Farlow
02:12 - so Farlow as I told we have four things
02:18 - first one is initialization so
02:22 - initializing the variable which is given
02:26 - here as I is equal to we'll take as 1 so
02:31 - we have initialized this so then we will
02:35 - give a semicolon here and then the next
02:39 - one here is the test condition let us
02:45 - have I is lesser than or equal to 10 so
02:54 - do a check for the test condition every
02:58 - time so what is the next one is the step
03:02 - value here whether you are going to
03:05 - increment or decrement
03:08 - so already we learnt about increment and
03:10 - decrement in the previous tutorial let
03:14 - us have here just increment and because
03:17 - it is from 1 to 10
03:20 - so I plus
03:25 - then we close this see only in the Far
03:28 - loop all three things come in a single
03:33 - state we initialize to you the test
03:37 - condition and then we'll give you the
03:39 - step value here to maybe plus plus I R I
03:44 - plus plus both the way tank so the next
03:48 - main thing we have here is body of the
03:52 - loop so any statement which we give
03:54 - inside this loop going to be the
03:57 - executor has many times as the loop
04:01 - condition get fulfilled let us just
04:04 - print the values system dot hope dot
04:12 - print line now here we are going to
04:16 - print just I let us print only I so what
04:19 - happens here in the beginning is equal
04:23 - to one it checks whether the condition
04:25 - get fulfilled or not
04:27 - so is lesser than ten that is true so
04:31 - what happens it is going to print I and
04:35 - then the next is it is going to
04:37 - increment by one so I becomes to test
04:41 - the condition and then still it is true
04:45 - so again it is going to print two then
04:49 - when it increments it becomes three
04:53 - again it checks it is true it is lesser
04:57 - than ten in the knee prints so like that
05:01 - it you will keep on doing until it is
05:05 - lesser than or equal to ten
05:07 - so when it is lesser than or equal to
05:10 - ten it is going to print and then when
05:15 - it increments it becomes eleven at last
05:19 - when it checks the condition eleven is
05:22 - false so ultimately it comes out of this
05:26 - loop so nothing else is there so
05:29 - automatically the program will start let
05:33 - us
05:33 - companies now this is going to print one
05:42 - to ten in next next lights so you can
05:49 - see that one to ten - printer
05:59 - in case if you need that numbers in
06:03 - reverse so this I to be printed in
06:06 - Reverse what you are going to do it is
06:09 - very simple so you are going to
06:11 - initialize as 10 yeah so I becomes 10
06:16 - and then I the condition is there so it
06:21 - is going to be greater than or equal to
06:24 - one isn't it
06:26 - so when it is going to print it will
06:28 - keep on subtracting one by one from ten
06:31 - until one so we can change here which is
06:35 - and then it is not I plus plus see here
06:40 - it is from bigger number to smaller
06:43 - number it is going to decrement so we
06:46 - can say here degree matter so let us try
06:51 - this
06:59 - so you can see 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ok
07:09 - let me tell one more thing in this see
07:14 - it will work until 1 but it will run
07:19 - also one more time which becomes zero
07:22 - and then test the condition which is
07:25 - false
07:26 - at last the number store in is 0 only
07:31 - but the test expression is false here so
07:36 - it stops so when it stops it will come
07:40 - out of the loop right so let us say Q
07:43 - the printing statement here let us bring
07:46 - the last value of I so the last value of
07:53 - i if we print what is going to be 0 so 0
07:57 - also will get printed this is forever
08:01 - reference compile this so you can see 10
08:11 - to 1 the condition is fulfilled then it
08:14 - comes out of the loop and then the
08:17 - previously stored value which is 0 also
08:22 - printed
08:30 - - let's argue some tips for you see when
08:36 - you want to initialize whether you want
08:38 - to smaller to big or big to small first
08:42 - you have to decide it after deciding you
08:45 - really have the number as you need here
08:49 - we have given ten and then we are going
08:53 - in decrement so that is bigger to small
08:57 - so do not forget to give greater than or
09:02 - equal to when it is big too smart so
09:06 - until that greater than or equal to that
09:09 - number it is going to do otherwise even
09:12 - you can you greater than zero also you
09:16 - can do so which is one but zero is not
09:19 - going to be executed and then if it is
09:22 - greater to smaller then you must have
09:27 - here - - okay if it is small to big
09:33 - automatically you will have here small
09:37 - and then here bigger one then bigger one
09:40 - is lesser than or equal to lesser than
09:43 - you have to do then here it should be
09:47 - plus plus so here sometimes the matching
09:52 - doesn't work what happens it becomes
09:55 - unconditionally running or never ranks
09:59 - that means you won't get output so these
10:02 - three things you have to see very
10:04 - seriously then it is going to work
10:08 - perfectly well today you understood how
10:15 - to use for loop in a program let us have
10:19 - many sessions for farlow so that I can
10:22 - take you to the higher level of using
10:26 - far loop that is even nested for loop so
10:30 - let us meet again in next session until
10:34 - then thank you students keep watching my
10:37 - videos and subscribe

hello students welcome back today we are going to see iteration grow loops the iteration statements allow a set of instruction to be performed repeatedly until a certain condition is fulfilled iteration statements are also called loop are looping statements Java provides three kinds of loops the first one is far loop second one is wide loop the third is dowhile loop in this session we are going to see simple for loop let us create a program every loop has its elements that control its execution generally loop has four elements first Tony's initialization and control variable the next one is test condition the third one is body of the loop and you can say the fourth one is step value let us have a variable count ie in type so we are going to see here Farlow so Farlow as I told we have four things first one is initialization so initializing the variable which is given here as I is equal to we'll take as 1 so we have initialized this so then we will give a semicolon here and then the next one here is the test condition let us have I is lesser than or equal to 10 so do a check for the test condition every time so what is the next one is the step value here whether you are going to increment or decrement so already we learnt about increment and decrement in the previous tutorial let us have here just increment and because it is from 1 to 10 so I plus then we close this see only in the Far loop all three things come in a single state we initialize to you the test condition and then we'll give you the step value here to maybe plus plus I R I plus plus both the way tank so the next main thing we have here is body of the loop so any statement which we give inside this loop going to be the executor has many times as the loop condition get fulfilled let us just print the values system dot hope dot print line now here we are going to print just I let us print only I so what happens here in the beginning is equal to one it checks whether the condition get fulfilled or not so is lesser than ten that is true so what happens it is going to print I and then the next is it is going to increment by one so I becomes to test the condition and then still it is true so again it is going to print two then when it increments it becomes three again it checks it is true it is lesser than ten in the knee prints so like that it you will keep on doing until it is

ultimately it comes out of this loop so nothing else is there so automatically the program will start let us companies now this is going to print one to ten in next next lights so you can see that one to ten printer in case if you need that numbers in reverse so this I to be printed in Reverse what you are going to do it is very simple so you are going to initialize as 10 yeah so I becomes 10 and then I the condition is there so it is going to be greater than or equal to one isn't it so when it is going to print it will keep on subtracting one by one from ten until one so we can change here which is and then it is not I plus plus see here it is from bigger number to smaller number it is going to decrement so we can say here degree matter so let us try this so you can see 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ok let me tell one more thing in this see it will work until 1 but it will run also one more time which becomes zero and then test the condition which is false at last the number store in is 0 only but the test expression is false here so it stops so when it stops it will come out of the loop right so let us say Q the printing statement here let us bring the last value of I so the last value of i if we print what is going to be 0 so 0 also will get printed this is forever reference compile this so you can see 10 to 1 the condition is fulfilled then it comes out of the loop and then the previously stored value which is 0 also printed let's argue some tips for you see when you want to initialize whether you want to smaller to big or big to small first you have to decide it after deciding you really have the number as you need here we have given ten and then we are going in decrement so that is bigger to small so do not forget to give greater than or equal to when it is big
