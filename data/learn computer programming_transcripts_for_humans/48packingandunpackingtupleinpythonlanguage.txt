00:04 - [Laughter]
00:17 - hello everyone in this class we are
00:19 - going to see packing and unpacking of
00:22 - tles in Python let us open idle let me
00:26 - initiate the variables with some values
00:30 - I give p is equal to
00:33 - 20 Q is = to
00:37 - 40 and then R is equal to
00:42 - 60 now if I need a tle from these
00:47 - values I shall create a dou
00:51 - T1 which is equal
00:54 - to open the parenthesis indicating the
00:57 - tle so p comma Q comma R and then I
01:03 - close this so now the values of these
01:07 - variables are in the tle then tle 1
01:12 - becomes 20 40 60 so let us
01:17 - check so it is a tle this is called
01:22 - packing unpacking is just reversed to
01:27 - this let me have another tle tle two
01:32 - which is equal
01:35 - to I have some names
01:39 - here
01:42 - Henry
01:45 - Abdul
01:47 - Surya 500 600
01:51 - 400 so if I want to unpa this I must be
01:56 - giving the variables which are equal to
01:59 - the length of this tle so in this tle
02:03 - six elements are there that means the
02:05 - length is six so I will be giving six
02:09 - variables bifurcating each with comma
02:12 - for example I give
02:15 - A1
02:17 - A2 A3
02:20 - A4 A5
02:22 - A6 which is equal to
02:26 - T2 otherwise we can also directly give
02:29 - the tle here I have the tle so I give
02:32 - the name of the tle there and then now
02:35 - each value is assigned to the
02:39 - variables A1 will have Henry A2 will
02:42 - have
02:43 - Abdul similar way up to A6 let us check
02:47 - now what is A6 it's supposed to be 400
02:51 - now A3 is
02:55 - Surya however the tle remains as the
03:00 - there is no change in it if we need
03:04 - names as one single variable and the
03:07 - values are in different variables I
03:09 - shall give star for example I give name
03:13 - only name and then the remaining 500 600
03:19 - 400 with other variables A1 comma A2
03:24 - comma A3 then equal to T2 so now Henry
03:31 - Abdul sua those together becomes a
03:36 - list remaining A1 is 500 A2 is 600 A3 is
03:41 - 400 let us check this so now name is a
03:46 - list having the
03:47 - names now A2 if you check it will be
03:54 - 600 in case we need the values in one
03:59 - list names are in different variables we
04:02 - shall also do that I give N1 comma N2
04:08 - comma N3 and then here
04:12 - star V IU which is equal to
04:16 - T2 now if I ask N1 it is hry V is a list
04:21 - with
04:24 - values we cannot apply this star to many
04:28 - variables only one it is possible what
04:31 - if we give a middle element with the
04:34 - star let us check I have here
04:39 - A1 star and A2 then A3 which is equal to
04:47 - T2 now A1 will be having Henry A2 will
04:52 - be Abdul sodia 500 and 600 let us
04:58 - check now the A3 is
05:02 - 400 in case we give star for two
05:04 - variables it will give you the error let
05:08 - us check A1 star a star B is equal to
05:16 - T2 here it shows error as multiple star
05:20 - expression in
05:21 - assignment let me
05:28 - summarize
06:17 - hope it is very clear to you keep
06:19 - watching my channel keep learning and
06:22 - keep sharing too thank
06:26 - you
