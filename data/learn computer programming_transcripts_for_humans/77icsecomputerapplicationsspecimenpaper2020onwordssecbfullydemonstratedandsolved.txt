With timestamps:

00:00 - welcome back students in this video we
00:03 - are going to continue solving Part B of
00:07 - computer applications 2020 onwards given
00:11 - by the ICAC both I will demonstrate the
00:18 - program directly on the bluej
00:21 - environment so that we can easily verify
00:24 - it question number four function
00:28 - transport company charges for the
00:30 - parcels of its customers as per the
00:33 - following specifications given below
00:35 - class name is given as air transport and
00:39 - then member variables are given here
00:42 - string name to store the name into W to
00:46 - store the weight of the parcel in kg and
00:49 - then int charge to store the charge of
00:53 - the parcel member functions given as
00:56 - usual it is wide except of to accept the
01:00 - name of the customer weight of the
01:02 - parcel from the user using scanner class
01:04 - it is being specified that you have to
01:06 - use scanner class-wide calculator to
01:11 - calculate the charges as per the weight
01:14 - of the parcel as per the following
01:17 - criteria weight in kilogram charges per
01:21 - kilogram up to 10 kilogram it is 25 per
01:24 - kg next to kilogram that is from 11 to
01:28 - 30 it is going to be 20 / kz above 30 it
01:33 - is going to be 10 per kg so it is a slab
01:36 - program we have to follow the
01:38 - calculations when we do in the program a
01:42 - surcharge of 5 percentage is charged on
01:45 - the bill in the next wide printer to
01:50 - print the name of the customer weight of
01:51 - the parcel total bill inclusive a
01:53 - surcharge in a tabular form in the
01:56 - following format so it will be in the
01:58 - tabular format as given here you will be
02:04 - giving first name weight and bill amount
02:06 - and then it will be printer whatever has
02:09 - been calculated define a class with the
02:11 - above-mentioned specification
02:13 - the main method create an object and Ino
02:17 - of the member methods let us first have
02:19 - the blueprint of this program in the
02:21 - mind see here member variables are given
02:25 - here three variables are given
02:27 - apart from that we may also require to
02:30 - find the surcharge and also the billed
02:33 - amount so we may need two more variables
02:36 - and then we will take a wide accept of
02:39 - there we will take the input so that is
02:42 - only these two are it required and then
02:44 - charged we are going to calculate then
02:48 - calculate off as per the slab we will
02:50 - calculate and then we will write one
02:53 - more method that is wide print off and
02:55 - then we will print it as needed here and
02:59 - then we will take object in the main
03:01 - method and invoke the member methods let
03:04 - us go to Bruges it I have copied the
03:07 - question here for my reference so let us
03:13 - start we need a input that is in scanner
03:18 - class so we will write import Java dot
03:22 - util dot scanner so class name is given
03:28 - there a transport here we need to
03:37 - declare the variables string name
03:43 - int W and also charge both are given if
03:49 - you want to calculate the surcharge that
03:50 - it will be in the decimal points so we
03:54 - can have double variable here W such as
03:59 - I will you yes charge then build amount
04:04 - also will be double so both I have
04:06 - declared here so we can have the comment
04:10 - here we can write yes charge to
04:18 - calculate surcharge
04:22 - and bill to calculate final amount now
04:33 - we need to create a method called accept
04:36 - so that is why wide accept of here we
04:43 - need to create a object for scanner
04:45 - class I will write scanner SC is equal
04:50 - to new scanner a system dot in now we
04:59 - will prompt the user to view the name
05:03 - system dot out dot print let it be print
05:16 - enter the name
05:21 - so we are going to assign now name is
05:25 - the variable given their name is equal
05:27 - to SC dot next line up we can also give
05:35 - line if it is a single name and then
05:41 - next we will prompt the user to you the
05:43 - weight of the parcel enter the weight of
05:57 - the parcel so here W is the variable W
06:06 - is equal to SC dot next int up so we are
06:14 - not going to take any more thing so we
06:16 - will just close this method now we have
06:19 - to create the other method called
06:21 - calculate off so wide calculate off so
06:34 - here if weight is lesser than or equal
06:37 - to ten so if W is lesser than or equal
06:42 - to ten charge is equal to so whatever
06:52 - the weight is there into twenty five
06:55 - right W into twenty five the next else
07:01 - if
07:09 - W is greater than 10 and W is lesser
07:19 - than or equal to 30
07:23 - so next to 20 this is 11 to 30 so that
07:27 - will be 20 as given in the question now
07:30 - what we are going to do charge is equal
07:33 - to say listen if it is greater than 10
07:36 - and less er than 30 already approaching
07:40 - 25 is the charge right so what we will
07:44 - do 10 into 25 plus the remaining so how
07:52 - do we find the remaining if it is lesser
07:54 - than 30 whatever the weight is there W
07:58 - minus 10 because then we have already
08:02 - calculated them so this 1 into I think
08:06 - it is 20 rupees so 20 let us confirm yes
08:16 - it is 20 rupees otherwise that is else
08:24 - charge is equal to first 10 will be
08:27 - calculated as calculated before 10 into
08:31 - 25 plus next 20 20 into 20 plus the
08:44 - remaining thing so remaining will be W
08:47 - minus 30 up to 30 we have already
08:50 - calculated into 10 rupees right yes here
08:56 - the calculation of charge is completed
09:00 - now we have to calculate the surcharge
09:03 - so what we can do yes charge is equal to
09:10 - charge and plus 5 percentage of charge
09:16 - so what we do charge into
09:21 - 0.05 we can directly write that is the
09:24 - best method 0.05 otherwise we can also
09:28 - write 5 a 100 point zero otherwise 5.0
09:32 - divided by 100 so after this we will
09:37 - close this now we need to print now why
09:42 - to print off here we can also calculate
09:48 - the billed amount otherwise our class
09:49 - while printing we can do so we will
09:51 - calculate here itself build this equal
09:56 - to charge plus surcharge now we are
10:08 - going to print the name of the customer
10:11 - weight of the parcel and amount that is
10:14 - in tabular form it is cell right so we
10:16 - will just print as a heading system dot
10:19 - out dot print line enough I print in the
10:25 - double quotation as it is going to print
10:27 - whatever rig you name so after this news
10:32 - we may need one tab space so backslash T
10:37 - I am giving for one tab space and then I
10:39 - am going to print wait wait and then
10:48 - again backslash T and then a month
10:53 - otherwise billed amount
11:02 - now we are going to print the actual
11:04 - values so the variable for name is name
11:15 - plus we need space so I give in double
11:19 - quotation backslash T then plus W plus
11:28 - again space plus bill demott so that is
11:36 - the build variable after this we are
11:40 - going to create a main method where we
11:44 - will call above methods so we need to
11:58 - create a object for creating object we
12:01 - need the class name the class name is
12:04 - Air Transport and then we need an object
12:10 - name that can be any valid identifier
12:12 - just like you EA t is equal to new and
12:18 - then the constructor so that is a T or a
12:21 - in SPO RT R so now with using the object
12:27 - name Katie we are going to call the
12:29 - methods so that is first is except of
12:35 - next is calculator next is printer
12:52 - then we closed the method so here two
13:00 - more or extra one more this also yes let
13:16 - us compile there is no syntax error let
13:24 - us check enter the name I write Kea yes
13:42 - the name simply enter the weight of a
13:47 - parcel let us check below 10 let us use
13:50 - 7 so name is a a weight is 7kh and then
13:58 - build among tasks including such as let
14:05 - us calculate about 10 students you can
14:14 - verify this manually once so that you
14:16 - will be confident that it is right
14:19 - enter the name just I give BV and then
14:26 - wait I give this 20 so it is been
14:33 - calculated as four hundred and seventy
14:35 - two point five so let us go to the next
14:40 - program write a program to input name
14:47 - and percentage of 35 students of a class
14:50 - 10 into separate one dimensional arrays
14:54 - arrange students details according to
14:56 - their percentage in the descending order
15:00 - using selections or Twitter
15:03 - display name and percentage of first ten
15:05 - toppers of the class see listen here we
15:07 - have to create two single dimensional
15:10 - array one having the name of the student
15:12 - other having the percentage of the
15:16 - student so that is 35 is the size of the
15:19 - array then we are going to sort it
15:25 - according to the mark wise that is the
15:29 - highest in the top so that is descending
15:31 - order we must use the selection sort and
15:34 - then we will print only the toppers that
15:38 - is ten toppers we are going to print
15:40 - this
15:41 - so let us go to blue Z and write a
15:43 - program so I have copied the question
15:47 - here let us start we need to take the
15:49 - input further erase so we will import
15:54 - Java dot util dot scanner class yes SATA
16:02 - you now I create a main method here
16:25 - here we need a few variables so as we
16:29 - are going to start out descending order
16:33 - we are going to take the maximum value
16:35 - and the maximum index then for swapping
16:37 - we need a temporary variables there are
16:41 - two arrays that is one is with the
16:44 - string other one is with the integer
16:46 - type so we will take two swapping
16:49 - variables and then for loops we will
16:52 - take inj so first I create in maximum
16:57 - value as EMV and then maximum index as
17:01 - see my I take and then for percentage
17:07 - Pete my tech that is for swapping then I
17:13 - and J for loops so for swapping string
17:18 - array I need a string variable that is
17:21 - name so that is name and Tempah you now
17:28 - let us create a scanner class object
17:41 - now let us declare the erase string yen
17:47 - off so this is the single dimensional
17:50 - array is equal to new string of 35 is
17:57 - the RSS given so I will create 35 next
18:03 - we need a percentage that is average
18:07 - right so integer type into P array
18:12 - symbol is equal to new in half again 35
18:17 - marks we are going to enter now let us
18:25 - give the prompt to before the loop
18:27 - itself so that it does not continue
18:29 - every time system dot out dot print line
18:36 - off enter the name and percentage of 35
18:48 - students we can do
18:57 - so let us go to loop now far the index
19:04 - starts from zero we know I already have
19:07 - declared is equal to zero is so last
19:13 - index will be 34
19:15 - so that is lesser than 35 we can also
19:21 - give lesser than length also so I am
19:25 - going to do just here neon dot length of
19:31 - sorry length length off means it becomes
19:34 - first string then I plus plus so first
19:45 - let me take the input for the name yarn
19:49 - is the variable we are given for array
19:51 - enough I so that is 0 1 2 3 up to 35 so
19:56 - that is from 0 to 34 it will take 35
20:00 - elements yes see dot next up so that we
20:05 - are going to use a single name here PF
20:09 - so that is percentage so every time
20:12 - after entering the name we will take the
20:18 - percentage a see dot next int
20:34 - after that we need a loop for starting
20:41 - when I is equal to zero I is lesser then
20:48 - n dot length minus one now you will give
20:54 - so instead of lesser than 35 minus 1
20:59 - that is 34 we give like this then I plus
21:08 - plus students we are just solving the
21:19 - paper here if we want to know full
21:22 - detail about this selection sort you can
21:24 - watch my previous video the maximum
21:28 - value we are going to assign s MV as the
21:33 - first one so that is P of I according to
21:38 - percentage only we are going to start so
21:40 - we are going to start PFI later it will
21:45 - sake rather which is the maximum one and
21:48 - then it will swap so the index of that
21:52 - mi is equal to I to check the greater
21:58 - one we are going to have a far loop here
22:01 - far J is equal to ie plus 1 so the first
22:09 - index and the next index it is going to
22:12 - take then J is lesser then young dot
22:18 - length then J plus plus here if
22:28 - p FJ is greater than maximum value then
22:40 - what we are going to do maximum value
22:49 - becomes PF j sorry small j and maximum
23:03 - index becomes J so it will be doing
23:08 - first pass and then when it completes
23:14 - this inner loop get completed the
23:17 - maximum value from that particular array
23:20 - might have been found then it is fact
23:23 - that is outside the inner loop the
23:27 - swapping here we will do P temp is equal
23:33 - to P of I then P of Y we are going to
23:44 - put it P of mi
23:54 - and then again PF mi is equal to PM
24:07 - students see here we have started the
24:13 - percentage but name also should be
24:16 - shattered isn't it we can sort as their
24:20 - marks are getting sorted the same way
24:23 - the names also will get sorted so that
24:26 - the particular student only will have
24:28 - that whatever the marks he has taken so
24:31 - we will swear as the marks are swept
24:37 - enough I and then
24:42 - enough ie is equal to enough mi enough
24:55 - mi is equal to nm now after this we will
25:08 - come out of this outer for loop and then
25:13 - we need to print the name and the
25:15 - average so let me give like this system
25:18 - dot out dot print line of a regular one
25:30 - tab space and then
25:39 - now to print all the names and
25:43 - percentage I need for loop right here
25:47 - far is equal to 0 it has been asked to
25:54 - only the 10 stoppers so we have done in
25:57 - the descending order from that we will
26:00 - take only 10 elements and print not all
26:04 - the elements so we need a far loop 0 to
26:07 - 9 otherwise 0 to lesser than 10 is
26:11 - lesser than 10 I plus plus now I just
26:19 - simply print the values
26:29 - sorry tiger print enough I so that is
26:40 - name it is going to print and then let
26:43 - me have one tab space here plus P of X
26:51 - so that is percentage it is going to
26:53 - print so let me give in the next line
26:57 - otherwise it will be in the same line so
26:59 - I mean I give a escape sequence e to
27:02 - make a next new line so we have closed
27:10 - method and the class let us compile this
27:15 - no syntax error students I don't want to
27:19 - show that 35 students name and the
27:22 - person days I entered so I will just
27:25 - change this to 5 or 6 so let me give 6
27:30 - students so here Y n dot length is there
27:36 - so there won't be any problem from 6 I
27:40 - will print the top two students name and
27:44 - the percentage so lesser than 2 I you
27:46 - there is no syntax error let me run this
27:50 - program
27:56 - so enter the name of the pathways of 35
27:59 - students we have not change the prompt
28:01 - it's okay
28:03 - let us enter 6 details simply a UA 56b
28:13 - 78 see 65 sorry see 65 become a name
28:23 - it's ok 65 be 98 e39 yes 99 let us check
28:46 - it is not being subtle that may be small
28:49 - mistake let us check that
29:00 - and I'll see here instead of Jay we have
29:05 - given I so we should be very careful
29:08 - compile this once again dry we'll run
29:21 - let us enter now a 78 b7 100 C 25 be 65
29:48 - e30 to f100 sorry 100 so you can see
30:03 - that B is 100 then you have this hundred
30:08 - so it is being sorted and then the tapas
30:11 - list has displayed here or let us go to
30:18 - the next program question 6 design a
30:21 - class to overload a function sum of as
30:24 - follows so here this is the function
30:27 - name given it should be overloaded first
30:30 - one with which is returning integer type
30:34 - and then having two variables both are
30:38 - integer type what it does some of the
30:42 - even numbers in the range of a and B so
30:44 - the starting and the ending number is
30:46 - given as the input and then the sum of
30:51 - all the even numbers between the range
30:54 - is taken inclusive of a and B next one
30:58 - some ee n so it is returning double type
31:02 - then Yun also is double one with one
31:07 - double argument calculate and return the
31:10 - product of the following series so it is
31:12 - starting from one
31:13 - into 1.2 into 1.4 so Z by 0.2 it is
31:19 - increasing up to n the next one it is
31:23 - returning integer type it is taking the
31:26 - argument also as integer 1 with 1
31:30 - integer argument calculate and return
31:32 - the sama only our digits of the number
31:35 - here for example it is a given sample
31:39 - four three nine six one is the number so
31:41 - that is forty three thousand nine
31:42 - hundred sixty-one here it is going to
31:45 - take all the odd digits so that is 3 is
31:47 - odd here it is taken nine is odd here it
31:50 - is taken and then one is are here taken
31:52 - then it has been added together and then
31:57 - it has been asked to write a main method
31:58 - to create an object and invoke the above
32:00 - method so we have to write the main
32:02 - method and call the methods so these are
32:06 - all with parameters when we call we
32:08 - should mention the parameters
32:11 - reverberated so let us go to blue Z so
32:14 - here is the question which has been
32:16 - copied ok let us start we don't need to
32:20 - take any input here the class name I
32:23 - give s power load itself does not
32:26 - mentioned in the question so I need to
32:32 - have in some off with two integers that
32:37 - is given in the question into a comma in
32:41 - to be
32:45 - here I will have some variable because
32:50 - it to be returned hint I will take
32:55 - someone is equal to zero in the
33:00 - beginning default value then far so int
33:07 - is equal to the range is given here to
33:09 - be so ei will be there then I is lesser
33:14 - than or equal to be I plus plus so from
33:19 - this range what it will do it will take
33:22 - only the even numbers and take the sum
33:26 - so for that we have to check the
33:27 - condition if I more two equal to equal
33:35 - to zero means it is going to be even
33:37 - number so then what I am going to do
33:39 - some one equal to some one plus I we can
33:47 - you and then it is going to return so we
33:52 - come out of this far low and then we
33:55 - will write return someone so that's all
34:02 - the first method get over you can also
34:05 - check this method separately so let us
34:09 - try that no syntax error so we have to
34:13 - create the instance there then I run
34:18 - this for example just like you five and
34:23 - then to ten so it will be adding only
34:28 - six eight that is 14 and then ten is 24
34:32 - so let us check so 24 it written close
34:39 - so let us start continuing it
34:45 - next one is double type double some w
35:01 - double type sum to is equal to here we
35:07 - are going to multiply and the series is
35:09 - multiplication so I should start with
35:11 - one far let us take double variable here
35:17 - double I is equal to one point zero then
35:26 - I is lesser than or equal to n what it
35:33 - is going to do by point two it is going
35:35 - to increase so just I you here I plus
35:38 - equal to zero point two so every time it
35:40 - is going to add point two with that some
35:44 - two is equal to some 2 multiplied by I
35:55 - then it should return it is only one
35:59 - statement in the far loop so that I have
36:00 - not given the curly braces return some
36:07 - toe so let us see one try this I will
36:17 - you 10.2 only one into one point two it
36:20 - will print as one point to itself that
36:22 - is sick you can check manually as you
36:27 - need for the correctness of the program
36:28 - let us do the next one the third one
36:32 - here int sum off into n here I need to
36:44 - extract the digits for that I will
36:46 - create a variable called into already
36:50 - and then sum 3 is equal to 0 as we are
36:57 - going to just add initially 0 then we
37:00 - need a loop here we don't know how many
37:03 - digits will be there and the user gives
37:06 - so when we are not confirm about the
37:08 - number of iterations we will take while
37:11 - loop while
37:14 - n is greater than 0 what we will do now
37:20 - we will extract visit by digit so that
37:25 - is last digit I have taken right LD is
37:28 - equal to n more sorry capital n more 10
37:36 - so it takes the last digit after
37:39 - dividing by 10 the remainder will be
37:42 - once if we are going to check now
37:47 - whether it is odd or not if card only we
37:50 - are going to sum otherwise we will not
37:52 - do anything
37:53 - LD more to equal to equal to 1 so then
37:58 - it is alright now we will do some 3 is
38:03 - equal to some 3 plus Garrity and then we
38:10 - should remove that last trade is it for
38:13 - that we will take only the quotient so n
38:17 - is equal to n divided by 10 so this will
38:25 - keep continuing until n is greater than
38:27 - 0 we have to print the sum at last that
38:35 - is returning return sum 3 so let us
38:44 - check
38:48 - so I will run into one C four five six
38:56 - five then one see here four is even
39:03 - number five is odd number and then again
39:06 - five is odd number so 10 10 plus 1 is 11
39:10 - so you can see 11 is wind it up close so
39:14 - we have checked all the methods now we
39:16 - need to create a main method and then
39:18 - call this public static void main a
39:25 - string of arguments let us queue the
39:32 - class name overload I just use o is
39:37 - equal to new overload of poor dot sum of
39:46 - two integer arguments so I use 6 comma
39:50 - 10 and then OH dot sum of 1 double type
39:58 - I you 1.4 and then OH dot sum of 2 3 4 7
40:15 - so compile this no syntax errors let us
40:20 - go to the next question using the switch
40:24 - statement write a menu driven program to
40:27 - perform following operations to print
40:29 - the value of Z where Z is equal to X
40:33 - cube plus 0.5 into X divided by Y where
40:38 - X ranges from minus 10 to 10 with an
40:42 - increment of 2 and y remains constant at
40:45 - five point five see here here it is
40:48 - given - 10 - 10 as the value of x so we
40:54 - have to print all the values when X is
40:58 - minus 10 minus 8 minus 6
41:01 - up to ten so we need a far loop starting
41:04 - from is equal to minus ten and lesser
41:08 - than or equal to 10 the next one to
41:13 - print the Floyd's triangle with and Rose
41:16 - the floods triangle will be the
41:19 - continuous number one two three four
41:21 - five six like that then whatever the
41:24 - number of rows given so that many rows
41:27 - it is going to print now we need input
41:30 - so we will do import Java dot util dot
41:35 - scanner class may know I have given now
41:42 - I write a main method
41:54 - I need to take option for the menu so I
41:58 - you int whoa
42:01 - scanner SC is equal to new scanner a
42:08 - system dot in then I give the menos
42:13 - system dot out dot print line up here
42:20 - just I print minnow and then now I will
42:26 - continue this so one is for value of Z
42:39 - right one dot the second one is flight
42:50 - strand of Andros
43:02 - so now I will prompt the user to into
43:05 - the choice
43:19 - whether you print instead of printing
43:23 - then I am going to assign the value so
43:26 - whoa is the option Rho is equal to SC
43:30 - dot next int up so user will enter
43:35 - whether one are two now we are going to
43:38 - start switch the option which we have
43:42 - taken is row now case one we need two
43:58 - variables here one is double Z that is
44:05 - the value it is going to calculate and
44:08 - then vice value is already given as 5.5
44:13 - there so I initialize directly here then
44:17 - I need a farlow int X is equal to as I
44:23 - said minus 10 X is lesser than or equal
44:29 - to 10
44:34 - x+ equal to two so every time two is
44:38 - been incremented then I want to
44:40 - calculate here so we know the math
44:47 - function Z is equal to math dot P whoa W
44:54 - of X comma 3 X cube it is plus 0.5 into
45:04 - X this is whole divided by Y divided by
45:12 - Y now it should print all the values of
45:21 - Z so I do system dot out dot print line
45:27 - off value of said while X is so it will
45:39 - be better to understand axis X plus so
45:46 - whatever the value it starts from minus
45:48 - 10 minus 10 minus 8 minus 6 so all will
45:51 - be displayed easy to understand the
45:54 - output plus so that is that it is going
46:00 - to print then what we will do we will
46:05 - break this do not forget break you will
46:09 - lose the marks the next we will start
46:13 - case to case 2 so I need two variables
46:19 - into N and then also the case value it
46:25 - will be keep increasing so that is IJ
46:28 - and then K I take inj further loops and
46:31 - then K is to increment the value
46:33 - continuously to write the variables
46:36 - there now
46:42 - system dot out dot print off so I asked
46:47 - the number of rows from the user enter
46:52 - the value for n far into is equal to 1
47:08 - is lesser than or equal to n so these
47:13 - many rows we need so outer loop is four
47:16 - rows then here again I need a inner loop
47:23 - that is far into J is equal to 1 J is
47:31 - lesser than or equal to I so it will be
47:34 - right angle triangle J plus plus now I
47:41 - need to print case value system dot out
47:46 - dot print only not print line so it will
47:51 - be in the same line these are columns so
47:53 - K I am going to print with that some
47:56 - space is required otherwise it will look
47:58 - like a single number so I do some two
48:02 - space then I need to increase the K so
48:07 - always keep increasing and prints it
48:10 - doesn't relate to I loop are J loop we
48:15 - have not taken any input we have not
48:18 - assigned it so n is equal to yes C dot
48:21 - next int C we should be very careful
48:26 - about this so outside this loop we will
48:33 - give a line space
48:43 - then what we're supposed to do we can
48:46 - break otherwise you can just leave like
48:49 - that
48:50 - in the question it is not been asked to
48:52 - display the message for wrong option
48:55 - given with a user so that is optional we
48:58 - can give our way without that also you
49:01 - will get full marks here we will not do
49:03 - that but in case in the question it is
49:06 - been asked to display the message when
49:08 - the user gives the wrong input means you
49:12 - must try to default remember it compile
49:17 - no syntax error let us run this so now I
49:26 - do
49:27 - so one has the option see there you
49:33 - could see 4 minus 10 when the x value is
49:36 - minus 10 when X values minus 8 all the
49:40 - values it has been calculated and
49:43 - printed here the dispel you of Z now let
49:48 - me try with the next one option number 2
49:53 - I you here so now it will be asked how
49:57 - many rows I need I may need 4 so you can
50:02 - see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 continuously it
50:06 - is being filtered for rows so let us go
50:10 - to the next question write a program to
50:14 - input and store integer elements in a
50:17 - double dimensional array of size 4 into
50:20 - 4 and to find the sum of all the
50:22 - elements so here only in this year
50:27 - double dimensional array programs are
50:29 - also there I will give you more videos
50:31 - on the double dimension array but I have
50:35 - already taught how to declare and II
50:37 - retrieve the variable from the double
50:39 - dimensional array so let us do that so I
50:42 - do import Java dot util dot scanner
50:49 - class double dimensional array IU public
50:57 - static void main of string of our events
51:09 - now I will take the input from the user
51:13 - for that scanner class object scanner
51:17 - ASC is equal to nu an error system dot
51:23 - in I prompt user enter the values for
51:39 - double dimensional array
51:41 - I do not declare the double dimension
51:47 - array so in AR are of two types of array
51:50 - symbols use the double dimensional in
51:53 - new int of the size is given s 4 into 4
51:58 - so 4 rows and 4 columns so I need to
52:05 - take sum of all the elements so I do int
52:08 - sum is equal to 0 now I need a Farlow we
52:15 - need to follow for double dimensional
52:17 - array far in is equal to 0 is lesser
52:25 - than 4 then I plus plus next Farlow so
52:33 - before that let me give the prompt so
52:36 - that every row the user will come to
52:39 - know it is next to Row system
52:52 - enter four elements for a row so that is
53:01 - the row number we will give so I will be
53:06 - the row so what I do here it starts from
53:10 - zero but the row starts from one when we
53:13 - count I will give I plus one then I plus
53:18 - 1 plus :
53:29 - now I will give the inner for loop far
53:33 - into j is equal to 0 J is lesser than
53:38 - for J plus plus so now let me take the
53:47 - input ARR of I and J see here is the row
53:57 - when I is 0 J will become 0 1 2 3 so
54:02 - that is 4 elements it will take again
54:05 - the outer for loop it will go I becomes
54:08 - 1 and then like that totally 4 times it
54:11 - will take a seedot next in tough just we
54:18 - need to sum all the elements so in this
54:21 - far loop only we can add as the user
54:23 - enters the value it will take the sum
54:25 - sum plus equal to a or are off now it
54:36 - will sum and then we are going to print
54:39 - the sum outside the loops
55:02 - plus some it is very simple one so let
55:07 - us compile no syntax errors so enter
55:18 - four elements for Row 1 so I will enter
55:23 - 5 5 5 5 4 times 5 then now I will give 4
55:31 - times 6 so now the total is 44
55:41 - let me give now to I am giving similar
55:50 - because it will be easy for calculation
55:53 - to check now I will give 8 here so this
56:04 - becomes 40 plus 44 84 correct let us go
56:11 - to the last question write a program to
56:16 - input a string and convert it into
56:19 - uppercase and print the paid of vowels
56:21 - and numbers of pairs of vowels occurring
56:25 - in the string for example input is
56:28 - beautiful beauties so that is paid of
56:32 - verbals see here E and a this is a pair
56:39 - of oval and then again next a and you
56:42 - said a and you are paste like that
56:52 - here again ena is there again yen he was
56:57 - there then here ine is there
57:00 - so all these pastes to be printed and
57:03 - then has to be countered and then print
57:06 - the number of page there so let us go to
57:10 - our program so again I will take import
57:15 - Java dot util dot scanner so I need a
57:48 - variable string variable string s then I
57:54 - need two character variable to check the
57:58 - first character in the next character so
58:00 - I will take care C 1 and then C 2 then I
58:08 - need to count so I will take int count
58:11 - initially 0 now I need to take an input
58:18 - scanner class object now
58:28 - then I prompt the user enter the string
58:46 - so we are saying now yes is equal to SC
58:49 - dot next line up line up
58:54 - takes the complete sentence until you
58:58 - will press the Enter key next to means
59:02 - it will take only one word until the
59:04 - space given now we need to convert this
59:08 - into uppercase s is equal to yes dot to
59:13 - uppercase off we need a far loop and
59:17 - then inside the follow only we need to
59:20 - print so let us give just the reference
59:22 - before the far loop system dot out dot
59:28 - print line now the rice print will you
59:36 - paid off verbals now far the index value
59:50 - always starts from zero so int I is
59:53 - equal to zero is lesser than or sorry
59:58 - lesser then only the last index is one
60:01 - lesser than the length so yes dot length
60:11 - off here if we take I is 0
60:15 - I plus 1 will be 1 so at last if we see
60:19 - it will go out of bounds because the
60:22 - last character and then plus one is not
60:24 - available so we will go before that only
60:27 - so I you minus one then I plus plus
60:36 - now I take first character that is C 1
60:40 - is equal to yes dot carrot I the next
60:46 - character also I have to check whether
60:48 - that is also verbal or not so I assign C
60:52 - 2 is equal to yes dot carrot I plus 1
60:59 - this is next letter here now how I will
61:05 - check if C 1 equal to equal to whether a
61:13 - are I will copy this I will check all a
61:23 - eio you
61:24 - yeah I have checked now I placed at 5
61:34 - times totally e i o u so it is checking
61:50 - whether C 1 is AR er IR oru and see this
62:01 - should be inside one bracket okay means
62:05 - if this is true and the next character
62:11 - also any one of this so all this but it
62:16 - should be see to see here there is one
62:19 - extra let us delete now I will copy this
62:26 - all this let me in the next life
62:39 - so I should close this if now this is c2
62:44 - right
62:45 - c2 then what it will do you will just
63:00 - print system dot out dot print off c1
63:11 - plus c2 if we give like this it will
63:17 - take the ASCII value and I are both so
63:20 - better we will give one double quotation
63:23 - here so it becomes a string there
63:25 - nothing there
63:26 - it cannot be added so it will display
63:30 - nearby plus one stays to differentiate
63:34 - this or not to space now if it is there
63:39 - it prints and then also count increases
63:43 - count plus plus I here so outside the
63:49 - loop we will print the count the pace
63:53 - will be printed every time the count
63:55 - will be printed once at last
64:06 - so here without print line we give so we
64:11 - need to create a new line for that I do
64:14 - backslash n then number of fade of all
64:24 - vowels plus count just compile this no
64:33 - syntax error
64:34 - let us run this we will give the same
64:37 - example which was given in the question
64:40 - paper duties so you can see here here it
64:49 - is shown 17 or let us check what mistake
64:53 - we have done there most probably curly
64:55 - braces we are not given yes for if we
65:01 - need to view the curly braces there so
65:04 - otherwise only the printing system is in
65:07 - the condition the count is not in the
65:10 - condition compile this and run once
65:25 - so you can see now that's why it is
65:29 - always better to dry run once after
65:32 - writing the program students keep
65:35 - watching my channels it will lead you to
65:38 - get excellent marks maybe 100 you make
65:42 - it Thank You students

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back students in this video we are going to continue solving Part B of computer applications 2020 onwards given by the ICAC both I will demonstrate the program directly on the bluej environment so that we can easily verify it question number four function transport company charges for the parcels of its customers as per the following specifications given below class name is given as air transport and then member variables are given here string name to store the name into W to store the weight of the parcel in kg and then int charge to store the charge of the parcel member functions given as usual it is wide except of to accept the name of the customer weight of the parcel from the user using scanner class it is being specified that you have to use scanner classwide calculator to calculate the charges as per the weight of the parcel as per the following criteria weight in kilogram charges per kilogram up to 10 kilogram it is 25 per kg next to kilogram that is from 11 to 30 it is going to be 20 / kz above 30 it is going to be 10 per kg so it is a slab program we have to follow the calculations when we do in the program a surcharge of 5 percentage is charged on the bill in the next wide printer to print the name of the customer weight of the parcel total bill inclusive a surcharge in a tabular form in the following format so it will be in the tabular format as given here you will be giving first name weight and bill amount and then it will be printer whatever has been calculated define a class with the abovementioned specification the main method create an object and Ino of the member methods let us first have the blueprint of this program in the mind see here member variables are given here three variables are given apart from that we may also require to find the surcharge and also the billed amount so we may need two more variables and then we will take a wide accept of there we will take the input so that is only these two are it required and then charged we are going to calculate then calculate off as per the slab we will calculate and then we will write one more method that is wide print off and then we will print it as needed here and then we will take object in the main method and invoke the member methods let us go to Bruges it I have copied the question here for my reference so let us start we need a input that is in scanner class so we will write import Java dot util dot scanner so class name is given there a transport here we need to declare the variables string name int W and also charge both are given if you want to calculate the surcharge that it will be in the decimal points so we can have double variable here W such as I will you yes charge then build amount also will be double so both I have declared here so we can have the comment here we can write yes charge to calculate surcharge and bill to calculate final amount now we need to create a method called accept so that is why wide accept of here we need to create a object for scanner class I will write scanner SC is equal to new scanner a system dot in now we will prompt the user to view the name system dot out dot print let it be print enter the name so we are going to assign now name is the variable given their name is equal to SC dot next line up we can also give line if it is a single name and then next we will prompt the user to you the weight of the parcel enter the weight of the parcel so here W is the variable W is equal to SC dot next int up so we are not going to take any more thing so we will just close this method now we have to create the other method called calculate off so wide calculate off so here if weight is lesser than or equal to ten so if W is lesser than or equal to ten charge is equal to so whatever the weight is there into twenty five right W into twenty five the next else if W is greater than 10 and W is lesser than or equal to 30 so next to 20 this is 11 to 30 so that will be 20 as given in the question now what we are going to do charge is equal to say listen if it is greater than 10 and less er than 30 already approaching 25 is the charge right so what we will do 10 into 25 plus the remaining so how do we find the remaining if it is lesser than 30 whatever the weight is there W minus 10 because then we have already calculated them so this 1 into I think it is 20 rupees so 20 let us confirm yes it is 20 rupees otherwise that is else charge is equal to first 10 will be calculated as calculated before 10 into 25 plus next 20 20 into 20 plus the remaining thing so remaining will be W minus 30 up to 30 we have already calculated into 10 rupees right yes here the calculation of charge is completed now we have to calculate the surcharge so what we can do yes charge is equal to charge and plus 5 percentage of charge so what we do charge into 0.05 we can directly write that is the best method 0.05 otherwise we can also write 5 a 100 point zero otherwise 5.0 divided by 100 so after this we will close this now we need to print now why to print off here we can also calculate the billed amount otherwise our class while printing we can do so we will calculate here itself build this equal to charge plus surcharge now we are going to print the name of the customer weight of the parcel and amount that is in tabular form it is cell right so we will just print as a heading system dot out dot print line enough I print in the double quotation as it is going to print whatever rig you name so after this news we may need one tab space so backslash T I am giving for one tab space and then I am going to print wait wait and then again backslash T and then a month otherwise billed amount now we are going to print the actual values so the variable for name is name plus we need space so I give in double quotation backslash T then plus W plus again space plus bill demott so that is the build variable after this we are going to create a main method where we will call above methods so we need to create a object for creating object we need the class name the class name is Air Transport and then we need an object name that can be any valid identifier just like you EA t is equal to new and then the constructor so that is a T or a in SPO RT R so now with using the object name Katie we are going to call the methods so that is first is except of next is calculator next is printer then we closed the method so here two more or extra one more this also yes let us compile there is no syntax error let us check enter the name I write Kea yes the name simply enter the weight of a parcel let us check below 10 let us use 7 so name is a a weight is 7kh and then build among tasks including such as let us calculate about 10 students you can verify this manually once so that you will be confident that it is right enter the name just I give BV and then wait I give this 20 so it is been calculated as four hundred and seventy two point five so let us go to the next program write a program to input name and percentage of 35 students of a class 10 into separate one dimensional arrays arrange students details according to their percentage in the descending order using selections or Twitter display name and percentage of first ten toppers of the class see listen here we have to create two single dimensional array one having the name of the student other having the percentage of the student so that is 35 is the size of the array then we are going to sort it according to the mark wise that is the highest in the top so that is descending order we must use the selection sort and then we will print only the toppers that is ten toppers we are going to print this so let us go to blue Z and write a program so I have copied the question here let us start we need to take the input further erase so we will import Java dot util dot scanner class yes SATA you now I create a main method here here we need a few variables so as we are going to start out descending order we are going to take the maximum value and the maximum index then for swapping we need a temporary variables there are two arrays that is one is with the string other one is with the integer type so we will take two swapping variables and then for loops we will take inj so first I create in maximum value as EMV and then maximum index as see my I take and then for percentage Pete my tech that is for swapping then I and J for loops so for swapping string array I need a string variable that is name so that is name and Tempah you now let us create a scanner class object now let us declare the erase string yen off so this is the single dimensional array is equal to new string of 35 is the RSS given so I will create 35 next we need a percentage that is average right so integer type into P array symbol is equal to new in half again 35 marks we are going to enter now let us give the prompt to before the loop itself so that it does not continue every time system dot out dot print line off enter the name and percentage of 35 students we can do so let us go to loop now far the index starts from zero we know I already have declared is equal to zero is so last index will be 34 so that is lesser than 35 we can also give lesser than length also so I am going to do just here neon dot length of sorry length length off means it becomes first string then I plus plus so first let me take the input for the name yarn is the variable we are given for array enough I so that is 0 1 2 3 up to 35 so that is from 0 to 34 it will take 35 elements yes see dot next up so that we are going to use a single name here PF so that is percentage so every time after entering the name we will take the percentage a see dot next int after that we need a loop for starting when I is equal to zero I is lesser then n dot length minus one now you will give so instead of lesser than 35 minus 1 that is 34 we give like this then I plus plus students we are just solving the paper here if we want to know full detail about this selection sort you can watch my previous video the maximum value we are going to assign s MV as the first one so that is P of I according to percentage only we are going to start so we are going to start PFI later it will sake rather which is the maximum one and then it will swap so the index of that mi is equal to I to check the greater one we are going to have a far loop here far J is equal to ie plus 1 so the first index and the next index it is going to take then J is lesser then young dot length then J plus plus here if p FJ is greater than maximum value then what we are going to do maximum value becomes PF j sorry small j and maximum index becomes J so it will be doing first pass and then when it completes this inner loop get completed the maximum value from that particular array might have been found then it is fact that is outside the inner loop the swapping here we will do P temp is equal to P of I then P of Y we are going to put it P of mi and then again PF mi is equal to PM students see here we have started the percentage but name also should be shattered isn't it we can sort as their marks are getting sorted the same way the names also will get sorted so that the particular student only will have that whatever the marks he has taken so we will swear as the marks are swept enough I and then enough ie is equal to enough mi enough mi is equal to nm now after this we will come out of this outer for loop and then we need to print the name and the average so let me give like this system dot out dot print line of a regular one tab space and then now to print all the names and percentage I need for loop right here far is equal to 0 it has been asked to only the 10 stoppers so we have done in the descending order from that we will take only 10 elements and print not all the elements so we need a far loop 0 to 9 otherwise 0 to lesser than 10 is lesser than 10 I plus plus now I just simply print the values sorry tiger print enough I so that is name it is going to print and then let me have one tab space here plus P of X so that is percentage it is going to print so let me give in the next line otherwise it will be in the same line so I mean I give a escape sequence e to make a next new line so we have closed method and the class let us compile this no syntax error students I don't want to show that 35 students name and the person days I entered so I will just change this to 5 or 6 so let me give 6 students so here Y n dot length is there so there won't be any problem from 6 I will print the top two students name and the percentage so lesser than 2 I you there is no syntax error let me run this program so enter the name of the pathways of 35 students we have not change the prompt it's okay let us enter 6 details simply a UA 56b 78 see 65 sorry see 65 become a name it's ok 65 be 98 e39 yes 99 let us check it is not being subtle that may be small mistake let us check that and I'll see here instead of Jay we have given I so we should be very careful compile this once again dry we'll run let us enter now a 78 b7 100 C 25 be 65 e30 to f100 sorry 100 so you can see that B is 100 then you have this hundred so it is being sorted and then the tapas list has displayed here or let us go to the next program question 6 design a class to overload a function sum of as follows so here this is the function name given it should be overloaded first one with which is returning integer type and then having two variables both are integer type what it does some of the even numbers in the range of a and B so the starting and the ending number is given as the input and then the sum of all the even numbers between the range is taken inclusive of a and B next one some ee n so it is returning double type then Yun also is double one with one double argument calculate and return the product of the following series so it is starting from one into 1.2 into 1.4 so Z by 0.2 it is increasing up to n the next one it is returning integer type it is taking the argument also as integer 1 with 1 integer argument calculate and return the sama only our digits of the number here for example it is a given sample four three nine six one is the number so that is forty three thousand nine hundred sixtyone here it is going to take all the odd digits so that is 3 is odd here it is taken nine is odd here it is taken and then one is are here taken then it has been added together and then it has been asked to write a main method to create an object and invoke the above method so we have to write the main method and call the methods so these are all with parameters when we call we should mention the parameters reverberated so let us go to blue Z so here is the question which has been copied ok let us start we don't need to take any input here the class name I give s power load itself does not mentioned in the question so I need to have in some off with two integers that is given in the question into a comma in to be here I will have some variable because it to be returned hint I will take someone is equal to zero in the beginning default value then far so int is equal to the range is given here to be so ei will be there then I is lesser than or equal to be I plus plus so from this range what it will do it will take only the even numbers and take the sum so for that we have to check the condition if I more two equal to equal to zero means it is going to be even number so then what I am going to do some one equal to some one plus I we can you and then it is going to return so we come out of this far low and then we will write return someone so that's all the first method get over you can also check this method separately so let us try that no syntax error so we have to create the instance there then I run this for example just like you five and then to ten so it will be adding only six eight that is 14 and then ten is 24 so let us check so 24 it written close so let us start continuing it next one is double type double some w double type sum to is equal to here we are going to multiply and the series is multiplication so I should start with one far let us take double variable here double I is equal to one point zero then I is lesser than or equal to n what it is going to do by point two it is going to increase so just I you here I plus equal to zero point two so every time it is going to add point two with that some two is equal to some 2 multiplied by I then it should return it is only one statement in the far loop so that I have not given the curly braces return some toe so let us see one try this I will you 10.2 only one into one point two it will print as one point to itself that is sick you can check manually as you need for the correctness of the program let us do the next one the third one here int sum off into n here I need to extract the digits for that I will create a variable called into already and then sum 3 is equal to 0 as we are going to just add initially 0 then we need a loop here we don't know how many digits will be there and the user gives so when we are not confirm about the number of iterations we will take while loop while n is greater than 0 what we will do now we will extract visit by digit so that is last digit I have taken right LD is equal to n more sorry capital n more 10 so it takes the last digit after dividing by 10 the remainder will be once if we are going to check now whether it is odd or not if card only we are going to sum otherwise we will not do anything LD more to equal to equal to 1 so then it is alright now we will do some 3 is equal to some 3 plus Garrity and then we should remove that last trade is it for that we will take only the quotient so n is equal to n divided by 10 so this will keep continuing until n is greater than 0 we have to print the sum at last that is returning return sum 3 so let us check so I will run into one C four five six five then one see here four is even number five is odd number and then again five is odd number so 10 10 plus 1 is 11 so you can see 11 is wind it up close so we have checked all the methods now we need to create a main method and then call this public static void main a string of arguments let us queue the class name overload I just use o is equal to new overload of poor dot sum of two integer arguments so I use 6 comma 10 and then OH dot sum of 1 double type I you 1.4 and then OH dot sum of 2 3 4 7 so compile this no syntax errors let us go to the next question using the switch statement write a menu driven program to perform following operations to print the value of Z where Z is equal to X cube plus 0.5 into X divided by Y where X ranges from minus 10 to 10 with an increment of 2 and y remains constant at five point five see here here it is given 10 10 as the value of x so we have to print all the values when X is minus 10 minus 8 minus 6 up to ten so we need a far loop starting from is equal to minus ten and lesser than or equal to 10 the next one to print the Floyd's triangle with and Rose the floods triangle will be the continuous number one two three four five six like that then whatever the number of rows given so that many rows it is going to print now we need input so we will do import Java dot util dot scanner class may know I have given now I write a main method I need to take option for the menu so I you int whoa scanner SC is equal to new scanner a system dot in then I give the menos system dot out dot print line up here just I print minnow and then now I will continue this so one is for value of Z right one dot the second one is flight strand of Andros so now I will prompt the user to into the choice whether you print instead of printing then I am going to assign the value so whoa is the option Rho is equal to SC dot next int up so user will enter whether one are two now we are going to start switch the option which we have taken is row now case one we need two variables here one is double Z that is the value it is going to calculate and then vice value is already given as 5.5 there so I initialize directly here then I need a farlow int X is equal to as I said minus 10 X is lesser than or equal to 10 x+ equal to two so every time two is been incremented then I want to calculate here so we know the math function Z is equal to math dot P whoa W of X comma 3 X cube it is plus 0.5 into X this is whole divided by Y divided by Y now it should print all the values of Z so I do system dot out dot print line off value of said while X is so it will be better to understand axis X plus so whatever the value it starts from minus 10 minus 10 minus 8 minus 6 so all will be displayed easy to understand the output plus so that is that it is going to print then what we will do we will break this do not forget break you will lose the marks the next we will start case to case 2 so I need two variables into N and then also the case value it will be keep increasing so that is IJ and then K I take inj further loops and then K is to increment the value continuously to write the variables there now system dot out dot print off so I asked the number of rows from the user enter the value for n far into is equal to 1 is lesser than or equal to n so these many rows we need so outer loop is four rows then here again I need a inner loop that is far into J is equal to 1 J is lesser than or equal to I so it will be right angle triangle J plus plus now I need to print case value system dot out dot print only not print line so it will be in the same line these are columns so K I am going to print with that some space is required otherwise it will look like a single number so I do some two space then I need to increase the K so always keep increasing and prints it doesn't relate to I loop are J loop we have not taken any input we have not assigned it so n is equal to yes C dot next int C we should be very careful about this so outside this loop we will give a line space then what we're supposed to do we can break otherwise you can just leave like that in the question it is not been asked to display the message for wrong option given with a user so that is optional we can give our way without that also you will get full marks here we will not do that but in case in the question it is been asked to display the message when the user gives the wrong input means you must try to default remember it compile no syntax error let us run this so now I do so one has the option see there you could see 4 minus 10 when the x value is minus 10 when X values minus 8 all the values it has been calculated and printed here the dispel you of Z now let me try with the next one option number 2 I you here so now it will be asked how many rows I need I may need 4 so you can see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 continuously it is being filtered for rows so let us go to the next question write a program to input and store integer elements in a double dimensional array of size 4 into 4 and to find the sum of all the elements so here only in this year double dimensional array programs are also there I will give you more videos on the double dimension array but I have already taught how to declare and II retrieve the variable from the double dimensional array so let us do that so I do import Java dot util dot scanner class double dimensional array IU public static void main of string of our events now I will take the input from the user for that scanner class object scanner ASC is equal to nu an error system dot in I prompt user enter the values for double dimensional array I do not declare the double dimension array so in AR are of two types of array symbols use the double dimensional in new int of the size is given s 4 into 4 so 4 rows and 4 columns so I need to take sum of all the elements so I do int sum is equal to 0 now I need a Farlow we need to follow for double dimensional array far in is equal to 0 is lesser than 4 then I plus plus next Farlow so before that let me give the prompt so that every row the user will come to know it is next to Row system enter four elements for a row so that is the row number we will give so I will be the row so what I do here it starts from zero but the row starts from one when we count I will give I plus one then I plus 1 plus now I will give the inner for loop far into j is equal to 0 J is lesser than for J plus plus so now let me take the input ARR of I and J see here is the row when I is 0 J will become 0 1 2 3 so that is 4 elements it will take again the outer for loop it will go I becomes 1 and then like that totally 4 times it will take a seedot next in tough just we need to sum all the elements so in this far loop only we can add as the user enters the value it will take the sum sum plus equal to a or are off now it will sum and then we are going to print the sum outside the loops plus some it is very simple one so let us compile no syntax errors so enter four elements for Row 1 so I will enter 5 5 5 5 4 times 5 then now I will give 4 times 6 so now the total is 44 let me give now to I am giving similar because it will be easy for calculation to check now I will give 8 here so this becomes 40 plus 44 84 correct let us go to the last question write a program to input a string and convert it into uppercase and print the paid of vowels and numbers of pairs of vowels occurring in the string for example input is beautiful beauties so that is paid of verbals see here E and a this is a pair of oval and then again next a and you said a and you are paste like that here again ena is there again yen he was there then here ine is there so all these pastes to be printed and then has to be countered and then print the number of page there so let us go to our program so again I will take import Java dot util dot scanner so I need a variable string variable string s then I need two character variable to check the first character in the next character so I will take care C 1 and then C 2 then I need to count so I will take int count initially 0 now I need to take an input scanner class object now then I prompt the user enter the string so we are saying now yes is equal to SC dot next line up line up takes the complete sentence until you will press the Enter key next to means it will take only one word until the space given now we need to convert this into uppercase s is equal to yes dot to uppercase off we need a far loop and then inside the follow only we need to print so let us give just the reference before the far loop system dot out dot print line now the rice print will you paid off verbals now far the index value always starts from zero so int I is equal to zero is lesser than or sorry lesser then only the last index is one lesser than the length so yes dot length off here if we take I is 0 I plus 1 will be 1 so at last if we see it will go out of bounds because the last character and then plus one is not available so we will go before that only so I you minus one then I plus plus now I take first character that is C 1 is equal to yes dot carrot I the next character also I have to check whether that is also verbal or not so I assign C 2 is equal to yes dot carrot I plus 1 this is next letter here now how I will check if C 1 equal to equal to whether a are I will copy this I will check all a eio you yeah I have checked now I placed at 5 times totally e i o u so it is checking whether C 1 is AR er IR oru and see this should be inside one bracket okay means if this is true and the next character also any one of this so all this but it should be see to see here there is one extra let us delete now I will copy this all this let me in the next life so I should close this if now this is c2 right c2 then what it will do you will just print system dot out dot print off c1 plus c2 if we give like this it will take the ASCII value and I are both so better we will give one double quotation here so it becomes a string there nothing there it cannot be added so it will display nearby plus one stays to differentiate this or not to space now if it is there it prints and then also count increases count plus plus I here so outside the loop we will print the count the pace will be printed every time the count will be printed once at last so here without print line we give so we need to create a new line for that I do backslash n then number of fade of all vowels plus count just compile this no syntax error let us run this we will give the same example which was given in the question paper duties so you can see here here it is shown 17 or let us check what mistake we have done there most probably curly braces we are not given yes for if we need to view the curly braces there so otherwise only the printing system is in the condition the count is not in the condition compile this and run once so you can see now that's why it is always better to dry run once after writing the program students keep watching my channels it will lead you to get excellent marks maybe 100 you make it Thank You students
