00:00 - [Music]
00:14 - welcome back everyone in this class we
00:17 - are going to see the
00:18 - another jump statement which is continue
00:20 - statement
00:22 - continuous statement in for loop
00:24 - let us consider the general code here
00:27 - for variable in sequence
00:29 - statement 1
00:31 - so if the variable is available in the
00:33 - sequence statement 1 compulsorily get
00:35 - executed
00:37 - if condition
00:38 - then continue statement
00:40 - outside the if condition there is a
00:42 - statement 2 and also statement 3 outside
00:46 - the for loop statement 4 is there
00:48 - when this if condition becomes true
00:51 - the continue statement is here
00:53 - it lets
00:55 - again continue the loop instead of going
00:58 - to the statement 2 and statement 3 so in
01:00 - this way the statement 2 and statement 3
01:03 - are
01:04 - skipped and then it continues to the
01:06 - loop again
01:09 - when the condition is evaluated as false
01:13 - then it will be executing statement 2
01:15 - and 3 also
01:17 - when the loop is completed normally it
01:19 - will go to the statement 4 and executes
01:23 - let us understand this using the example
01:25 - program
01:26 - i give for i in
01:28 - range
01:30 - 12 comma
01:31 - 20
01:33 - i just print
01:35 - in the loop
01:40 - and also i print
01:41 - i here
01:43 - outside this loop i will be printing
01:46 - print
01:49 - loop completed
01:56 - let me introduce the continuous
01:58 - statement with
01:59 - condition
02:01 - if
02:02 - i mode
02:03 - 2 equal to
02:05 - 0
02:06 - that means when it is divisible by
02:09 - 2
02:10 - it will continue to the loop without
02:12 - printing it so only odd number is going
02:14 - to be
02:15 - printed so i give continue here
02:20 - let us execute this
02:23 - so you could see that
02:26 - it printed 13 15 17 19. in the loop it
02:29 - is printed every time
02:32 - but only the number is not printed
02:36 - when the loop completed
02:38 - it came out of the loop and printed loop
02:41 - completed here
02:42 - continuous statement in while loop it is
02:44 - almost similar
02:46 - while condition the statement one if
02:50 - condition
02:51 - continues there
02:53 - statement 2 and statement 3
02:55 - outside the loop statement 4.
02:58 - when the condition becomes true it
03:00 - continues to the
03:01 - while loop and then statement 1 is
03:04 - executed again statement 2 and 3 are
03:06 - skipped
03:08 - whenever the condition is false
03:11 - then
03:12 - it will execute statement 2 and 3 also
03:15 - when normally while loop get completed
03:18 - it comes to the statement 4 which is
03:21 - outside the loop let us also execute an
03:23 - example program for this
03:26 - now for while loop i will first
03:28 - initialize the variable x is equal to
03:32 - 12
03:35 - while x is lesser than 20
03:40 - print
03:41 - x
03:43 - now i will increase the value of x by 1
03:45 - plus equal to 1
03:50 - outside the loop i print
03:56 - loop completed
03:58 - let me execute this
04:01 - so all the numbers are printed here
04:06 - now i give the continue statement
04:08 - if x mode to equal to 0
04:13 - continue
04:15 - see when it is even number it is not
04:17 - going to print x it is going to continue
04:19 - well
04:20 - but when it is even number when it
04:22 - enters inside the if the increment is
04:24 - not done so it continues with the same
04:27 - number it becomes
04:28 - non-stopable loop or infinity loop
04:31 - so what i do i just take this from here
04:35 - and then add it to the
04:38 - beginning of this
04:42 - now it will start from 13 otherwise we
04:44 - can make this as 11
04:48 - so now it becomes 12 and then it starts
04:52 - let us execute this
04:55 - you could see 13 15 17 19 and then loop
04:58 - completed
05:00 - so this is how
05:02 - the jump statements work to skip some
05:05 - code inside the loop
05:09 - hope the concept is clear
05:12 - keep practicing
05:14 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back everyone in this class we are going to see the another jump statement which is continue statement continuous statement in for loop let us consider the general code here for variable in sequence statement 1 so if the variable is available in the sequence statement 1 compulsorily get executed if condition then continue statement outside the if condition there is a statement 2 and also statement 3 outside the for loop statement 4 is there when this if condition becomes true the continue statement is here it lets again continue the loop instead of going to the statement 2 and statement 3 so in this way the statement 2 and statement 3 are skipped and then it continues to the loop again when the condition is evaluated as false then it will be executing statement 2 and 3 also when the loop is completed normally it will go to the statement 4 and executes let us understand this using the example program i give for i in range 12 comma 20 i just print in the loop and also i print i here outside this loop i will be printing print loop completed let me introduce the continuous statement with condition if i mode 2 equal to 0 that means when it is divisible by 2 it will continue to the loop without printing it so only odd number is going to be printed so i give continue here let us execute this so you could see that it printed 13 15 17 19. in the loop it is printed every time but only the number is not printed when the loop completed it came out of the loop and printed loop completed here continuous statement in while loop it is almost similar while condition the statement one if condition continues there statement 2 and statement 3 outside the loop statement 4. when the condition becomes true it continues to the while loop and then statement 1 is executed again statement 2 and 3 are skipped whenever the condition is false then it will execute statement 2 and 3 also when normally while loop get completed it comes to the statement 4 which is outside the loop let us also execute an example program for this now for while loop i will first initialize the variable x is equal to 12 while x is lesser than 20 print x now i will increase the value of x by 1 plus equal to 1 outside the loop i print loop completed let me execute this so all the numbers are printed here now i give the continue statement if x mode to equal to 0 continue see when it is even number it is not going to print x it is going to continue well but when it is even number when it enters inside the if the increment is not done so it continues with the same number it becomes nonstopable loop or infinity loop so what i do i just take this from here and then add it to the beginning of this now it will start from 13 otherwise we can make this as 11 so now it becomes 12 and then it starts let us execute this you could see 13 15 17 19 and then loop completed so this is how the jump statements work to skip some code inside the loop hope the concept is clear keep practicing thank you
