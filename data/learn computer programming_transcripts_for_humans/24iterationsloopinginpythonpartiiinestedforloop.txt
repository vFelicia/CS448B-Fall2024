00:02 - welcome back everyone
00:04 - in this class we are going to discuss
00:06 - about
00:07 - working of nested for loop in python
00:15 - what is nested loop
00:18 - when a loop is applied inside another
00:20 - loop it becomes a nested loop the loop
00:23 - which is inside the body of other loop
00:26 - is called inner loop and the first loop
00:29 - which is given outside that is called
00:31 - outer loop
00:33 - loops can be
00:34 - nested multiple times inside one another
00:38 - different types of loop also can be
00:41 - nested inside one another
00:43 - nested for loop
00:47 - for loop placed inside another for loops
00:50 - body
00:52 - let us understand working of this
00:54 - using a flowchart here one for loop is
00:57 - given this for loop first time it is
00:59 - given in the program it becomes the
01:02 - outer follow we know for loop works for
01:05 - every element of its sequence when
01:07 - element is available
01:10 - it executes the body
01:12 - the statements are given these
01:14 - statements are executed in this body
01:16 - itself another for loop is given
01:20 - this is
01:21 - the inner for loop now
01:24 - now here again elements in the sequence
01:27 - will be there
01:29 - when the elements are available
01:31 - it executes the statements it checks for
01:34 - the next element
01:35 - and then it will be executing again the
01:37 - statements once all the elements of the
01:40 - sequence get completed
01:42 - then it goes to the outer for loop for
01:45 - the next turn to check the next element
01:47 - whether it is available or not if it is
01:49 - available again the outer for loop
01:52 - executes its statement and then enters
01:54 - inside the inner loop again it keeps
01:57 - executing these many times
02:00 - and then once this get over it goes
02:03 - again to the outer loop similar way it
02:05 - keeps cycling like this once all the
02:08 - elements of this outer loop get over
02:11 - then it comes out of the loop it
02:13 - executes the other part of the program
02:15 - for example i made a bigger wheel and a
02:19 - smaller wheel bigger one is three times
02:21 - then the smaller if i have one cycle of
02:25 - this bigger wheel the smaller will run
02:27 - three times this you can take an example
02:30 - outer loop having one count and the
02:32 - inner loop having three count
02:34 - if the outer loop is having three counts
02:37 - then inner loop will run totally nine
02:39 - times let us see one example coding here
02:41 - for i in range one print outer loop that
02:44 - is i so range of one means it is going
02:47 - to take from zero by default 0 and then
02:49 - 1 is not included so only 1 for 0 it is
02:52 - going to run in the body of this another
02:54 - for loop called j here 3 times it runs
02:57 - j is getting printed so the output will
02:59 - be like this outer loop 0 inner 0 inner
03:03 - one inner two let us execute through the
03:05 - python program let me write for loop
03:08 - the same example as one
03:11 - print
03:14 - outer loop comma
03:16 - i now here i give far
03:19 - j in range
03:22 - i have three here
03:24 - and then i print here
03:28 - inner
03:29 - and then i give
03:31 - j
03:32 - so let us run this
03:35 - so you can see
03:36 - for router one time that is zero time
03:39 - inner runs three times
03:41 - zero one two if i increase this to 5
03:46 - let me check what happens every one time
03:48 - of i runs
03:50 - j will run 3 times
03:53 - you can see here 0 1 2 3 4 that is 5
03:56 - times every outer loop
03:58 - one time it runs inner loop runs three
04:01 - times range of five
04:03 - i am going to change this list here
04:06 - i will be giving roman letter one
04:09 - two
04:14 - three
04:15 - i want to run every time this one
04:18 - five times so what happens here
04:21 - i becomes
04:22 - this one i becomes this one i becomes
04:25 - this one let us check
04:29 - see outer loop 1 outer loop 2 outer loop
04:32 - 3
04:33 - it looks like the roman numbers
04:38 - in case if i change 1 gamma
04:41 - 6
04:42 - and then it is going to run 1 to 5
04:45 - times
04:47 - if i need little more gap here
04:49 - i just give some gap
04:53 - so you can see that little gap is there
04:55 - so this is just for understanding let us
04:57 - meet in the next class with more
04:59 - programs the pattern programs i will
05:01 - discuss those programs in very easy
05:03 - manner to understand so keep watching my
05:05 - channel until then bye
05:07 - thank you

welcome back everyone in this class we are going to discuss about working of nested for loop in python what is nested loop when a loop is applied inside another loop it becomes a nested loop the loop which is inside the body of other loop is called inner loop and the first loop which is given outside that is called outer loop loops can be nested multiple times inside one another different types of loop also can be nested inside one another nested for loop for loop placed inside another for loops body let us understand working of this using a flowchart here one for loop is given this for loop first time it is given in the program it becomes the outer follow we know for loop works for every element of its sequence when element is available it executes the body the statements are given these statements are executed in this body itself another for loop is given this is the inner for loop now now here again elements in the sequence will be there when the elements are available it executes the statements it checks for the next element and then it will be executing again the statements once all the elements of the sequence get completed then it goes to the outer for loop for the next turn to check the next element whether it is available or not if it is available again the outer for loop executes its statement and then enters inside the inner loop again it keeps executing these many times and then once this get over it goes again to the outer loop similar way it keeps cycling like this once all the elements of this outer loop get over then it comes out of the loop it executes the other part of the program for example i made a bigger wheel and a smaller wheel bigger one is three times then the smaller if i have one cycle of this bigger wheel the smaller will run three times this you can take an example outer loop having one count and the inner loop having three count if the outer loop is having three counts then inner loop will run totally nine times let us see one example coding here for i in range one print outer loop that is i so range of one means it is going to take from zero by default 0 and then 1 is not included so only 1 for 0 it is going to run in the body of this another for loop called j here 3 times it runs j is getting printed so the output will be like this outer loop 0 inner 0 inner one inner two let us execute through the python program let me write for loop the same example as one print outer loop comma i now here i give far j in range i have three here and then i print here inner and then i give j so let us run this so you can see for router one time that is zero time inner runs three times zero one two if i increase this to 5 let me check what happens every one time of i runs j will run 3 times you can see here 0 1 2 3 4 that is 5 times every outer loop one time it runs inner loop runs three times range of five i am going to change this list here i will be giving roman letter one two three i want to run every time this one five times so what happens here i becomes this one i becomes this one i becomes this one let us check see outer loop 1 outer loop 2 outer loop 3 it looks like the roman numbers in case if i change 1 gamma 6 and then it is going to run 1 to 5 times if i need little more gap here i just give some gap so you can see that little gap is there so this is just for understanding let us meet in the next class with more programs the pattern programs i will discuss those programs in very easy manner to understand so keep watching my channel until then bye thank you
