00:00 - hello everyone
00:02 - welcome back
00:05 - in this class we are going to see how to
00:07 - find the sum of series
00:10 - the first series is nothing but the
00:12 - natural numbers up to n number or n
00:14 - terms we can say let us understand how
00:17 - it works
00:18 - 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus up to n
00:22 - we need a variable which will be
00:23 - initiated as 0 before totaling anything
00:27 - by default it should be starting as 0 so
00:29 - i initialize a variable called sum
00:32 - as 0 the series here starts from 1 and
00:35 - then ends at n
00:37 - n should be taken as a user input
00:40 - we need a for loop to start from 1 and
00:43 - then which ends at n
00:45 - if the user input is n
00:48 - it will be ending at n minus 1 so to
00:50 - make it to stop at n we need to give n
00:54 - plus 1 in the for loop so the for loop
00:56 - may be like this for i in range one
00:59 - comma n plus one
01:00 - now the range here is
01:02 - one two three four so that means ice
01:05 - value every time changes as one two
01:07 - three four
01:08 - we don't need to do anything just take
01:11 - this number and then add with the sum so
01:15 - we shall write sum is equal to sum plus
01:17 - i
01:18 - sum is a variable where the
01:21 - old sums value
01:23 - will be added with i
01:25 - every time the i changes the new number
01:28 - is added to the sum
01:30 - and then variable get updated as a new
01:33 - sub
01:34 - for your understanding here i have given
01:36 - the step by step process
01:39 - at the first round sum is 0 that is
01:42 - initiated before the for loop and then i
01:44 - is value now when it is entering it will
01:46 - be 1
01:48 - sum is equal to sum plus i that is 0
01:51 - plus 1 is equal to 1
01:53 - this answer 1 is been taken as
01:56 - sum for the next round here
01:58 - by the time i's value will be 2
02:02 - now new sum will be
02:04 - 1 plus 2 equal to 3 again the value of
02:08 - sum will become 3
02:11 - so ice value is 3 and then sum is equal
02:13 - to 3 plus 3 6
02:16 - so if you keep working like this the
02:18 - pattern clearly says sum plus i i have
02:22 - shown you for better understanding in
02:24 - red color i is 1 2 3 4 like that and
02:26 - then sum is every time
02:28 - it gets the new sum
02:30 - if you are clear with this concept and
02:32 - then future any type of sum you are
02:34 - doing it will be very easy so take a
02:37 - time bit and understand clearly
02:40 - let us go to python and create the
02:41 - program
02:42 - let us take the user input for n
03:07 - sum is equal to zero
03:09 - for i in range
03:13 - one comma n plus one
03:19 - sum is equal to
03:21 - sum plus i
03:24 - once it is done
03:25 - we will be printing the output
03:28 - outside the for loop
03:36 - let us execute this
03:39 - so let us consider 5 1 plus 2 is 3 plus
03:43 - 3 is 6 plus 4 is 10 plus 5 is 15 so the
03:46 - answer is supposed to be 15
03:49 - it is right
03:52 - let me consider the
03:54 - next series here
03:56 - 2 plus 5 plus 8 up to n terms
03:59 - so the initial number is 2
04:01 - and the next number is 5 the difference
04:03 - is 3 here again the next number
04:07 - 8 has the difference 3
04:10 - as the initial number is 2 i will create
04:12 - one more variable called ini
04:15 - as 2
04:17 - and then sum as usual it is
04:20 - 0
04:21 - every time i take this
04:23 - sum it will be ini instead of i
04:27 - i will be
04:29 - counting the terms nothing else
04:31 - every time the new term gets formed by
04:35 - adding 3 to the old ini
04:38 - i will be giving here ini
04:42 - plus equal to
04:43 - 3 that means ini
04:46 - equal to ini plus 3
04:48 - let us check this
04:52 - if i give 3 as the input
04:55 - that is 3 terms 2 plus 5 is 7 plus 8 is
04:59 - 15
05:01 - answer is right
05:02 - hope you understood this
05:05 - if i need to print the series instead of
05:08 - the sum
05:09 - i will take this away
05:12 - i will get the user input
05:16 - that means the initial value also from
05:18 - the user
05:29 - some i don't need to have it
05:32 - instead of the constant value 3 let me
05:35 - take even that from the user
05:37 - let the variable for the
05:39 - differences d
05:42 - we copy this
05:43 - and paste below
05:47 - enter the difference
05:51 - so i shall
05:53 - print value now as
05:56 - ini
05:57 - and then if i need to print in the same
05:59 - line i take the help of end equal to
06:02 - with one command space
06:08 - this i won't be required
06:11 - and every time we need to add
06:13 - d instead of this
06:15 - 3 so i add this here
06:17 - let us execute this
06:20 - i need 5 terms
06:22 - to ls initial value
06:24 - and then 8 as the difference
06:27 - so 12 20 28 36 44 is write series with 5
06:31 - terms
06:33 - now i have a new series
06:35 - to find the sum
06:38 - initial value is 1
06:40 - then 4
06:41 - then 9
06:43 - then 16.
06:44 - if you see the common difference
06:47 - it is not there
06:49 - so what else it can be
06:54 - try this 1 squared
06:56 - 2 square
06:58 - 3 square
07:00 - 4 square
07:01 - then it shall be
07:02 - similar like the first program
07:05 - number of terms let it be
07:07 - initial value is not required
07:09 - and then sum supposed to be zero
07:16 - in range
07:17 - n plus 1 is right
07:19 - we shall take the
07:21 - sum
07:25 - plus equal to
07:29 - i into
07:30 - i so that is 1 into 1 2 into 2 3 into 3
07:34 - every time it will be
07:36 - adding it to the sum
07:38 - when we need to print we shall print it
07:40 - outside the for loop
07:42 - print
07:46 - sum of series
07:51 - sum
07:55 - let me execute this i need
07:59 - 3 terms
08:00 - it is 14
08:03 - so 1 plus 4 is 5 plus 9 is 14.
08:09 - now let us consider this term
08:12 - 1 by x plus 2 by x plus 3 by x plus
08:16 - until
08:17 - n
08:17 - so for n already there is a input
08:20 - statement
08:22 - we need x
08:23 - so let us
08:25 - take x is equal to
08:33 - value for
08:34 - x
08:38 - see 1 by x 2 by x 3 by x
08:42 - so in the numerator it is nothing but i
08:45 - in the denominator that is x
08:48 - so just divided by
08:50 - x we give
08:52 - it is so simple to understand
08:55 - let us run this
08:57 - let us give the easy number
08:59 - to calculate manually and check it i
09:02 - give 4 terms
09:04 - x let it be just 2
09:07 - the sum is 5.0
09:10 - 1 by x that is 1 by 2 that is 0.5
09:15 - plus 2 by 2 will become 1
09:18 - plus
09:19 - 3 by 2 become 1.5
09:23 - plus
09:24 - 4 by 2 will become
09:26 - 2
09:28 - so the answer is 5.0 here also when we
09:30 - are calculating manually then it is
09:32 - right
09:36 - if this is x by 1 x by 2 x by 3 x by 4
09:41 - and so on
09:42 - it is very simple
09:44 - we need to just
09:46 - change the denominator and numerator
09:48 - numerator is x
09:50 - and the denominator is i
09:57 - here again let me take
09:59 - 4
10:02 - and then here as
10:03 - 8
10:05 - this says
10:07 - 16.666
10:08 - let us manually do this 8 by 1 is 8
10:12 - 8 by 2 is 4
10:15 - 8 by 3 is
10:16 - 2.66
10:19 - or let us give like
10:21 - 8 by
10:23 - 3
10:25 - plus
10:27 - 8 by 4 is 2
10:29 - so this answer should be equal to the
10:32 - answer we got from the program
10:35 - it is same
10:39 - let us consider now
10:41 - 2 by x plus 4 by 2 x plus 6 by 3 x and
10:46 - then so on
10:48 - the denominator is 1 2 3
10:50 - multiplied by x
10:52 - the numerator is 2 times of it
10:55 - so if you are understanding the pattern
10:58 - of the series then it is very simple to
11:01 - solve this so in the numerator we can
11:03 - put i into 2 i is going to be 1 2 3 4.
11:07 - see now you check
11:10 - 1 into 2
11:11 - 2 into 2
11:13 - 3 into 2 and then so on
11:16 - divided by x 2 x 3 x
11:19 - so that is again i into
11:22 - x
11:25 - so this is 1 x
11:27 - 2 x of x 3 x of x and so on
11:31 - you need to remember one thing here
11:35 - this multiplication and division
11:38 - both are having the same operator
11:40 - precedence
11:43 - this will be done from left to right so
11:46 - that is i will be multiplying
11:49 - into 2 divided by i
11:51 - then it will be multiplied by
11:53 - x we will write it in the bracket
11:56 - similarly the denominator also in the
11:58 - bracket
12:00 - let us run this
12:04 - i give 3 terms
12:06 - easy to calculate and then 5 as the
12:08 - value it is 1.200
12:12 - let us calculate
12:15 - 2 divided by 5
12:18 - plus
12:18 - 4 divided by 10 will be
12:21 - 0.4
12:23 - plus
12:24 - 6 divided by 15
12:27 - 6 divided by
12:28 - 15
12:30 - so here also we are getting the
12:33 - right answer
12:36 - so far we have done this series which
12:38 - were not having any powers
12:40 - now we are having a series which is
12:43 - having a power that is x squared by 1
12:45 - plus x squared by 2 plus x square by 3
12:48 - and then so on now we can understand
12:51 - that denominator is i
12:54 - so we can change this as i
12:57 - and the numerator if you see x square
13:02 - so we can give here
13:05 - x
13:07 - to the power 2
13:09 - we can use the power operator that is
13:11 - star and star
13:13 - x square by 1
13:15 - then x square by 2
13:17 - x square by 3 it is so simple to
13:20 - understand
13:21 - let us
13:23 - run this
13:25 - i'll give just 4 and the x value let me
13:28 - take as only 2
13:31 - 8.333 it comes
13:34 - let us manually calculate and verify it
13:39 - 2 square is 4
13:40 - so 4 divided by 1 is 4
13:44 - plus
13:45 - again 4 by 2 is 2
13:49 - plus
13:50 - 4 by 3 that is 1.333 let us give like as
13:54 - it is
13:56 - 4 by 3 iq
13:58 - plus 4 by 4 that is 1
14:01 - so it is verified
14:03 - next
14:06 - here you can see x by 1 minus
14:09 - x square by 2 plus
14:12 - x cube by 3
14:14 - and then up to x to the power n divided
14:16 - by n
14:20 - the pattern here every time
14:22 - the even numbers term
14:25 - has minus in front of it
14:27 - the odd number has plus
14:29 - so we need to check
14:31 - whether it is even or odd
14:33 - if it is r then we will have plus
14:36 - otherwise we can give minus
14:39 - let us check this here
14:42 - if
14:43 - imod 2
14:45 - is equal to
14:48 - 0 then it is even element we should be
14:51 - subtracting it so sum minus equal to the
14:54 - term is x by 1 x square by 2 x cube by 3
14:58 - that means x to the power
15:01 - i
15:04 - then divided by
15:05 - i
15:08 - otherwise
15:11 - else
15:13 - let me have the semicolon
15:15 - and the indent do not forget this
15:20 - now
15:21 - the same thing but we will
15:23 - have plus
15:28 - change this as plus let us run
15:33 - i will give four terms
15:36 - and the value of x again i will use only
15:38 - two i get minus 1.3333
15:44 - let us check manually
15:46 - x is 2
15:48 - 2 divided by 1 is
15:50 - 2
15:51 - and then minus
15:54 - x square by 2
15:56 - that is
15:58 - 4 by
16:00 - 2 will be 2
16:02 - next plus
16:05 - x cube that is 8 divided by 3 let us put
16:09 - this in the bracket
16:11 - then now minus
16:13 - x to the power 4 that is 16 16 divided
16:16 - by 4
16:18 - this is nothing but
16:19 - 4
16:21 - we are getting the right answer
16:25 - let me have the new series here
16:27 - x by 2 plus x square by 4
16:30 - plus x cube by 6 so on
16:33 - here always it is plus so we don't need
16:36 - to check whether it is
16:38 - odd or even terms
16:40 - i will remove all this
16:42 - now if you see
16:44 - the numerator is x
16:47 - x to the power 2 x to the power 3 so
16:49 - that means x to the power i
16:51 - so it is same as it is here and then if
16:54 - you see the denominator it is
16:56 - 2 4 6 that is i into
17:01 - 2
17:03 - we need to put this in the bracket
17:06 - so this is that here the pluses missing
17:11 - let me check now
17:14 - i give three terms and then five is my
17:16 - value
17:18 - i get 29.58333
17:23 - let me just check
17:24 - giving the values
17:28 - 5 by 2 is 2.5
17:30 - plus 5 to the power 2 is 25 divided by
17:35 - 4 i put that in the
17:38 - bracket
17:41 - plus
17:43 - x cube that is 5 cube is 125
17:46 - divided by
17:48 - 6
17:51 - yeah this is right
17:53 - let us consider a new type of series
17:57 - one exclamatory mark to exclamation mark
18:00 - and then keeps going up to n
18:03 - exclamatory mark is nothing but
18:05 - factorial
18:07 - symbol for factorial is
18:09 - exclamation mark product of all positive
18:12 - integers which are lesser than or equal
18:15 - to n is
18:16 - n factorial
18:18 - then generally it is written n factorial
18:21 - is equal to
18:22 - n into n minus 1 into n minus 2 into up
18:26 - to 1
18:28 - for example
18:29 - 4 factorial is equal to 4 into 3 into 2
18:33 - into 1
18:35 - 5 factorial
18:37 - we can calculate also in reverse that is
18:39 - 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 into 5 the
18:42 - calculation can be
18:43 - in any way but the result is important
18:47 - let us understand first how do we find
18:50 - the factorial of a number
18:53 - if we see the
18:54 - sum of series the first
18:57 - series
18:59 - it was 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus up to n
19:03 - the factorial is nothing but replacing
19:05 - this plus into multiplication
19:09 - if we see the series which is needed to
19:11 - be find the sum now it is 1 factorial
19:14 - plus 2 factorial plus 3 factorial so
19:17 - every time you are finding the product
19:19 - of 1 1 into 2 here 1 into 2 into 3
19:23 - the next will be 1 into 2 into 3 into 4
19:26 - so up to n you will be finding so every
19:28 - time you are taking the product of that
19:30 - number and then you are adding also
19:33 - so the code may be like this
19:36 - f
19:36 - always we use as 1 as default and then
19:40 - sum is 0
19:42 - for i in range
19:44 - it is same
19:45 - 1 to n plus 1
19:48 - f is equal to f into i otherwise we can
19:51 - say f into equal to i
19:53 - see every time this will be finding the
19:55 - product of up to this number
19:57 - just we will take every time the sum of
20:00 - that
20:01 - it becomes sum of each term
20:04 - let me elaborate little more
20:08 - so first f is 1 i is
20:11 - 1
20:12 - f is equal to 1 into 1 becomes 1 and
20:14 - then sum becomes 0 plus 1 is equal to 1.
20:17 - so here this one is here
20:20 - now
20:21 - when i is 2
20:23 - the factorial will be already 1
20:26 - so 1 into 2 is equal to 2
20:28 - the sum is 1 here that is added with 2
20:31 - now it is 3
20:34 - the next round when i is 3
20:37 - the factorial is 2 already now this
20:41 - 2 into 3 is equal to 6
20:44 - and then 3 plus 6 is equal to 9 so the
20:47 - previous sum is added with this current
20:50 - factorial
20:52 - similar way it keeps going
20:55 - now 6 into 4 24
20:58 - old sum and the new factorial has been
21:00 - added
21:02 - let us modify the program to get the sum
21:05 - of the series
21:07 - i do not need this x i remove this
21:11 - with this i need f
21:13 - and then some f is by default 1
21:17 - here i am adding f into equal to
21:20 - i then every time i take the
21:23 - sum of f here
21:25 - let us execute this
21:27 - i give 5 here
21:29 - the answer is 153
21:31 - 1 factorial is 1
21:34 - 2 factorial is 2 3 factorial is 6 4
21:37 - factorial is 24
21:40 - 5 factorial is 120
21:42 - so this is verified
21:44 - now let us consider a new series with
21:47 - the factorial
21:48 - so that is x by 1 factorial
21:50 - plus
21:52 - x to the power 2 by 2 factorial plus x
21:55 - to the power 3 by 3 factorial and so on
21:58 - here we need the value for x let us
22:01 - write the statement again x is equal to
22:04 - into input of
22:06 - enter the value for
22:08 - x
22:13 - in the numerator
22:16 - x to the power i is given
22:18 - correct
22:19 - so we will write
22:21 - inside the bracket
22:22 - x
22:24 - to the power
22:25 - i
22:27 - let us execute this
22:30 - i just give three terms
22:32 - the value of x let it be just two
22:36 - the sum is 5.333
22:39 - let us calculate manually
22:41 - x is 2
22:43 - and then divide by 1 factorial is 1
22:46 - so it is 2
22:48 - plus x to the power 2 is 4 divided by
22:51 - 2 is 2
22:52 - x to the power 3 is
22:55 - 8 divided by 3 factorial is 6
22:58 - so we will give here 8 by
23:00 - 6 the output of the program is verified
23:05 - let us see the last one
23:10 - 1 by 1 plus 1 plus 2 by
23:12 - 1 into 2
23:15 - then the third term is 1 plus 2 plus 3
23:17 - divided by 1 into 2 into 3 so up to n
23:20 - terms
23:21 - if you see now in the numerator it is
23:24 - sums of all the numbers up to current
23:27 - number of term similarly in the
23:29 - denominator it is product that is
23:31 - nothing but factorial
23:32 - so we need to take the sum also the
23:35 - factorial both and then again we need to
23:38 - divide both
23:42 - we don't need this x let us take it away
23:45 - to take the sum of numerator again i
23:47 - need one more
23:49 - variable let me initialize that as
23:52 - s as 0
23:55 - now i need to take
23:57 - s
23:59 - plus equal to i
24:00 - so every time it takes the numerator as
24:04 - that particular top
24:06 - now the grand sum will be
24:11 - s by f
24:16 - let us run and verify
24:18 - i give just three terms
24:21 - three point five is the answer
24:26 - one by one
24:27 - the first term is one plus
24:30 - 1 plus 2 is 3
24:33 - and then 1 into 2 is 2 so 3 by 2
24:37 - let me put this in the bracket plus
24:41 - 1 plus 2 plus 3 is 6
24:44 - and then 1 into 2 into 3 6 so 6 by 6
24:46 - will be 1
24:48 - 3.5 it is verified
24:52 - hope
24:53 - the concept is clear and all these
24:55 - programs we have
24:57 - seen
25:00 - keep watching this channel keep learning
25:03 - and also keep sharing so that others

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to see how to find the sum of series the first series is nothing but the natural numbers up to n number or n terms we can say let us understand how it works 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus up to n we need a variable which will be initiated as 0 before totaling anything by default it should be starting as 0 so i initialize a variable called sum as 0 the series here starts from 1 and then ends at n n should be taken as a user input we need a for loop to start from 1 and then which ends at n if the user input is n it will be ending at n minus 1 so to make it to stop at n we need to give n plus 1 in the for loop so the for loop may be like this for i in range one comma n plus one now the range here is one two three four so that means ice value every time changes as one two three four we don't need to do anything just take this number and then add with the sum so we shall write sum is equal to sum plus i sum is a variable where the old sums value will be added with i every time the i changes the new number is added to the sum and then variable get updated as a new sub for your understanding here i have given the step by step process at the first round sum is 0 that is initiated before the for loop and then i is value now when it is entering it will be 1 sum is equal to sum plus i that is 0 plus 1 is equal to 1 this answer 1 is been taken as sum for the next round here by the time i's value will be 2 now new sum will be 1 plus 2 equal to 3 again the value of sum will become 3 so ice value is 3 and then sum is equal to 3 plus 3 6 so if you keep working like this the pattern clearly says sum plus i i have shown you for better understanding in red color i is 1 2 3 4 like that and then sum is every time it gets the new sum if you are clear with this concept and then future any type of sum you are doing it will be very easy so take a time bit and understand clearly let us go to python and create the program let us take the user input for n sum is equal to zero for i in range one comma n plus one sum is equal to sum plus i once it is done we will be printing the output outside the for loop let us execute this so let us consider 5 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 3 is 6 plus 4 is 10 plus 5 is 15 so the answer is supposed to be 15 it is right let me consider the next series here 2 plus 5 plus 8 up to n terms so the initial number is 2 and the next number is 5 the difference is 3 here again the next number 8 has the difference 3 as the initial number is 2 i will create one more variable called ini as 2 and then sum as usual it is 0 every time i take this sum it will be ini instead of i i will be counting the terms nothing else every time the new term gets formed by adding 3 to the old ini i will be giving here ini plus equal to 3 that means ini equal to ini plus 3 let us check this if i give 3 as the input that is 3 terms 2 plus 5 is 7 plus 8 is 15 answer is right hope you understood this if i need to print the series instead of the sum i will take this away i will get the user input that means the initial value also from the user some i don't need to have it instead of the constant value 3 let me take even that from the user let the variable for the differences d we copy this and paste below enter the difference so i shall print value now as ini and then if i need to print in the same line i take the help of end equal to with one command space this i won't be required and every time we need to add d instead of this 3 so i add this here let us execute this i need 5 terms to ls initial value and then 8 as the difference so 12 20 28 36 44 is write series with 5 terms now i have a new series to find the sum initial value is 1 then 4 then 9 then 16. if you see the common difference it is not there so what else it can be try this 1 squared 2 square 3 square 4 square then it shall be similar like the first program number of terms let it be initial value is not required and then sum supposed to be zero in range n plus 1 is right we shall take the sum plus equal to i into i so that is 1 into 1 2 into 2 3 into 3 every time it will be adding it to the sum when we need to print we shall print it outside the for loop print sum of series sum let me execute this i need 3 terms it is 14 so 1 plus 4 is 5 plus 9 is 14. now let us consider this term 1 by x plus 2 by x plus 3 by x plus until n so for n already there is a input statement we need x so let us take x is equal to value for x see 1 by x 2 by x 3 by x so in the numerator it is nothing but i in the denominator that is x so just divided by x we give it is so simple to understand let us run this let us give the easy number to calculate manually and check it i give 4 terms x let it be just 2 the sum is 5.0 1 by x that is 1 by 2 that is 0.5 plus 2 by 2 will become 1 plus 3 by 2 become 1.5 plus 4 by 2 will become 2 so the answer is 5.0 here also when we are calculating manually then it is right if this is x by 1 x by 2 x by 3 x by 4 and so on it is very simple we need to just change the denominator and numerator numerator is x and the denominator is i here again let me take 4 and then here as 8 this says 16.666 let us manually do this 8 by 1 is 8 8 by 2 is 4 8 by 3 is 2.66 or let us give like 8 by 3 plus 8 by 4 is 2 so this answer should be equal to the answer we got from the program it is same let us consider now 2 by x plus 4 by 2 x plus 6 by 3 x and then so on the denominator is 1 2 3 multiplied by x the numerator is 2 times of it so if you are understanding the pattern of the series then it is very simple to solve this so in the numerator we can put i into 2 i is going to be 1 2 3 4. see now you check 1 into 2 2 into 2 3 into 2 and then so on divided by x 2 x 3 x so that is again i into x so this is 1 x 2 x of x 3 x of x and so on you need to remember one thing here this multiplication and division both are having the same operator precedence this will be done from left to right so that is i will be multiplying into 2 divided by i then it will be multiplied by x we will write it in the bracket similarly the denominator also in the bracket let us run this i give 3 terms easy to calculate and then 5 as the value it is 1.200 let us calculate 2 divided by 5 plus 4 divided by 10 will be 0.4 plus 6 divided by 15 6 divided by 15 so here also we are getting the right answer so far we have done this series which were not having any powers now we are having a series which is having a power that is x squared by 1 plus x squared by 2 plus x square by 3 and then so on now we can understand that denominator is i so we can change this as i and the numerator if you see x square so we can give here x to the power 2 we can use the power operator that is star and star x square by 1 then x square by 2 x square by 3 it is so simple to understand let us run this i'll give just 4 and the x value let me take as only 2 8.333 it comes let us manually calculate and verify it 2 square is 4 so 4 divided by 1 is 4 plus again 4 by 2 is 2 plus 4 by 3 that is 1.333 let us give like as it is 4 by 3 iq plus 4 by 4 that is 1 so it is verified next here you can see x by 1 minus x square by 2 plus x cube by 3 and then up to x to the power n divided by n the pattern here every time the even numbers term has minus in front of it the odd number has plus so we need to check whether it is even or odd if it is r then we will have plus otherwise we can give minus let us check this here if imod 2 is equal to 0 then it is even element we should be subtracting it so sum minus equal to the term is x by 1 x square by 2 x cube by 3 that means x to the power i then divided by i otherwise else let me have the semicolon and the indent do not forget this now the same thing but we will have plus change this as plus let us run i will give four terms and the value of x again i will use only two i get minus 1.3333 let us check manually x is 2 2 divided by 1 is 2 and then minus x square by 2 that is 4 by 2 will be 2 next plus x cube that is 8 divided by 3 let us put this in the bracket then now minus x to the power 4 that is 16 16 divided by 4 this is nothing but 4 we are getting the right answer let me have the new series here x by 2 plus x square by 4 plus x cube by 6 so on here always it is plus so we don't need to check whether it is odd or even terms i will remove all this now if you see the numerator is x x to the power 2 x to the power 3 so that means x to the power i so it is same as it is here and then if you see the denominator it is 2 4 6 that is i into 2 we need to put this in the bracket so this is that here the pluses missing let me check now i give three terms and then five is my value i get 29.58333 let me just check giving the values 5 by 2 is 2.5 plus 5 to the power 2 is 25 divided by 4 i put that in the bracket plus x cube that is 5 cube is 125 divided by 6 yeah this is right let us consider a new type of series one exclamatory mark to exclamation mark and then keeps going up to n exclamatory mark is nothing but factorial symbol for factorial is exclamation mark product of all positive integers which are lesser than or equal to n is n factorial then generally it is written n factorial is equal to n into n minus 1 into n minus 2 into up to 1 for example 4 factorial is equal to 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 5 factorial we can calculate also in reverse that is 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 into 5 the calculation can be in any way but the result is important let us understand first how do we find the factorial of a number if we see the sum of series the first series it was 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus up to n the factorial is nothing but replacing this plus into multiplication if we see the series which is needed to be find the sum now it is 1 factorial plus 2 factorial plus 3 factorial so every time you are finding the product of 1 1 into 2 here 1 into 2 into 3 the next will be 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 so up to n you will be finding so every time you are taking the product of that number and then you are adding also so the code may be like this f always we use as 1 as default and then sum is 0 for i in range it is same 1 to n plus 1 f is equal to f into i otherwise we can say f into equal to i see every time this will be finding the product of up to this number just we will take every time the sum of that it becomes sum of each term let me elaborate little more so first f is 1 i is 1 f is equal to 1 into 1 becomes 1 and then sum becomes 0 plus 1 is equal to 1. so here this one is here now when i is 2 the factorial will be already 1 so 1 into 2 is equal to 2 the sum is 1 here that is added with 2 now it is 3 the next round when i is 3 the factorial is 2 already now this 2 into 3 is equal to 6 and then 3 plus 6 is equal to 9 so the previous sum is added with this current factorial similar way it keeps going now 6 into 4 24 old sum and the new factorial has been added let us modify the program to get the sum of the series i do not need this x i remove this with this i need f and then some f is by default 1 here i am adding f into equal to i then every time i take the sum of f here let us execute this i give 5 here the answer is 153 1 factorial is 1 2 factorial is 2 3 factorial is 6 4 factorial is 24 5 factorial is 120 so this is verified now let us consider a new series with the factorial so that is x by 1 factorial plus x to the power 2 by 2 factorial plus x to the power 3 by 3 factorial and so on here we need the value for x let us write the statement again x is equal to into input of enter the value for x in the numerator x to the power i is given correct so we will write inside the bracket x to the power i let us execute this i just give three terms the value of x let it be just two the sum is 5.333 let us calculate manually x is 2 and then divide by 1 factorial is 1 so it is 2 plus x to the power 2 is 4 divided by 2 is 2 x to the power 3 is 8 divided by 3 factorial is 6 so we will give here 8 by 6 the output of the program is verified let us see the last one 1 by 1 plus 1 plus 2 by 1 into 2 then the third term is 1 plus 2 plus 3 divided by 1 into 2 into 3 so up to n terms if you see now in the numerator it is sums of all the numbers up to current number of term similarly in the denominator it is product that is nothing but factorial so we need to take the sum also the factorial both and then again we need to divide both we don't need this x let us take it away to take the sum of numerator again i need one more variable let me initialize that as s as 0 now i need to take s plus equal to i so every time it takes the numerator as that particular top now the grand sum will be s by f let us run and verify i give just three terms three point five is the answer one by one the first term is one plus 1 plus 2 is 3 and then 1 into 2 is 2 so 3 by 2 let me put this in the bracket plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 is 6 and then 1 into 2 into 3 6 so 6 by 6 will be 1 3.5 it is verified hope the concept is clear and all these programs we have seen keep watching this channel keep learning and also keep sharing so that others also benefit from these videos
