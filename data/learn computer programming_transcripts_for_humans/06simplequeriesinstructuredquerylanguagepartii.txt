00:09 - hello everyone
00:11 - welcome back
00:12 - in today's class we are going to
00:13 - continue simple queries of mysql
00:16 - we will discuss
00:18 - performing simple calculations
00:21 - distinct function
00:23 - aggregate functions
00:25 - other simple queries like adding text
00:27 - column in view
00:29 - using alias naming view
00:32 - sometimes we may need to perform
00:35 - simple calculation for example
00:37 - multiplying two numbers or adding two
00:39 - numbers and displaying the result
00:42 - even these can be performed
00:44 - using the selection statement
00:47 - just we can write select and the
00:49 - expression and terminate
00:51 - for example we can write select 10 plus
00:54 - 25 so it will be displaying the result
00:58 - as
00:59 - 35
01:01 - select 5 into 100 another example
01:04 - how do we apply this in the columns of a
01:07 - table
01:08 - for example particular column is there
01:10 - if we need to multiply the whole column
01:13 - values into some numbers or if we need
01:16 - to find the percentage or we need to
01:18 - convert that into other unit we may need
01:21 - to perform the simple calculations like
01:23 - that
01:24 - we may add the expression to it and then
01:27 - display the result in the view
01:30 - for that we can have a query like this
01:32 - select which are all the column names we
01:35 - need
01:36 - and then the expression
01:38 - with the column name
01:40 - from
01:41 - as usual the table name
01:44 - if we consider the table called state
01:47 - here there are many columns at last if
01:50 - you see area square kilometer if i need
01:53 - to convert that into
01:55 - square meters for that purpose i can
01:58 - multiply that columns value into
01:59 - thousand that particular column all the
02:02 - rows to be multiplied and displayed
02:04 - with the state name
02:07 - how do i perform it
02:08 - i need state as well as the area
02:12 - so i will select these two columns
02:15 - select
02:17 - the column name that is state underscore
02:20 - ut
02:21 - area square kilometer is
02:23 - another column that i need to multiply
02:26 - with thousand so i have multiplied that
02:29 - with thousand
02:31 - from the table name so that is state is
02:34 - the table name
02:35 - when i give this i will be getting the
02:37 - state and the area in square meters i
02:41 - open my sql
02:48 - to perform the basic calculation
02:51 - select
02:52 - 500
02:54 - multiplied by 10
02:55 - then terminate
02:57 - this is also a
02:58 - view as a table
03:01 - here 500 into 10 is the field name and
03:03 - the 5000 is the result as an item
03:07 - another example
03:09 - select
03:11 - 70 divided by 10
03:14 - we are getting that in float data type
03:17 - as it is a division
03:19 - now if we want to apply this in a tables
03:22 - column
03:24 - to access the table first we need to get
03:26 - inside the
03:27 - database
03:29 - i have a database called india
03:32 - i use it
03:34 - there is a table called state
03:37 - let me check all the details of state
03:40 - select star from
03:43 - state
03:46 - if i want to display this state
03:49 - and the area
03:51 - all the values but multiplied by
03:53 - thousand
03:54 - as we saw in the example
03:56 - select
03:58 - state underscore ut
04:01 - comma the next column that is area
04:03 - column
04:05 - area
04:06 - multiplied by
04:08 - thousand
04:09 - from state
04:14 - we can see now
04:15 - values in the area all are multiplied
04:19 - by thousand and
04:20 - displayed
04:25 - distinct function
04:26 - selects the items from the column
04:29 - without any repetition
04:31 - for example if we are taking the table
04:33 - called state
04:35 - here you can see in the zone
04:37 - there are values which are repeated
04:40 - if we want to display these values
04:42 - without any repetition that means the
04:45 - north east we need to have only once
04:48 - not many times just to know how many
04:50 - distinct values are available there in
04:53 - that particular column we can use this
04:55 - statement
04:56 - this can also be combined with other
04:59 - functions
05:01 - syntax is here
05:03 - select distinct and then column name in
05:06 - the bracket from
05:08 - the table name
05:10 - for example if we need to perform
05:13 - zone here
05:15 - select distinct zone from state
05:19 - the column name should be inside the
05:22 - bracket
05:23 - that is distinct is a function here
05:26 - let us perform and check
05:28 - uniquely we will display
05:30 - the zones value
05:32 - select
05:33 - distinct
05:35 - off zone
05:37 - state
05:39 - you can see the values uniquely
05:41 - displayed north east is not repeated
05:45 - let us see the aggregate functions
05:47 - first let us take sum
05:50 - to find the sum of column of a table
05:54 - we shall give select sum of
05:57 - column name
05:58 - from
05:59 - table name
06:01 - for example
06:02 - if we are having this table
06:04 - if we need to take the sum of districts
06:08 - all the districts
06:09 - so it will be adding all the
06:12 - values in the district column and then
06:14 - it will be displaying as one value
06:18 - select sum of districts from state
06:21 - similar way if we want to take average
06:24 - of the particular column
06:26 - we shall give select average of column
06:29 - name
06:30 - from
06:31 - table name
06:32 - again for example
06:34 - select average of
06:36 - area square kilometer from state so it
06:39 - will be giving the average of the last
06:42 - column
06:45 - next finding maximum and minimum value
06:48 - of a
06:48 - column to find the maximum value we will
06:51 - have mbix
06:53 - to find the minimum value we will have
06:56 - min
06:57 - according to neet we shall give
06:59 - column name in the bracket from the
07:01 - table name
07:03 - for example here for maximum maximum of
07:06 - districts
07:07 - that means it will be displaying 38 as
07:10 - it is the highest value
07:13 - similar way if we need a minimum value
07:15 - of districts
07:16 - it will be giving 13 as the answer
07:20 - to count the
07:21 - total number of records from a table we
07:24 - are having count of function
07:27 - this also can be used to count number of
07:30 - values in particular column
07:32 - to display
07:34 - total number of records
07:36 - from a table we give select count of
07:39 - star from table name
07:42 - the example is select count of star from
07:46 - state
07:47 - if we want to count the number of rows
07:50 - in particular column
07:52 - it will exclude the null
07:54 - that means empty
07:56 - select count of column name from table
08:00 - name
08:00 - for example here
08:02 - if you see language column does not have
08:05 - value for this arunachal state it will
08:08 - not count this in the count it will
08:11 - count number of values available in that
08:14 - particular column so it will be showing
08:16 - 4 as the result
08:17 - for that example is here select
08:20 - count of language from state
08:23 - let us perform all these on mysql
08:28 - to select the
08:30 - sum of
08:31 - all the districts which is appearing
08:33 - here
08:34 - we shall give select
08:36 - sum open the bracket
08:39 - districts close the bracket
08:42 - from the table name that is state
08:46 - so we can see 142 is bit displayed there
08:50 - similar way if we want to find the
08:53 - maximum
08:54 - what shall we do
08:56 - we can change this as
08:58 - max
09:00 - so maximum number in the district
09:03 - maximum value will be shown that is 38
09:07 - if you want to bring the previously
09:09 - typed query
09:11 - we have an option here on the keyboard
09:13 - just press on the
09:15 - upper arrow key
09:17 - you will be getting the previous query
09:19 - if you want to go to previous to that
09:21 - and press once again
09:23 - similarly you can check all the queries
09:26 - and again execute
09:28 - even if you want to modify some query
09:30 - you can use the sideways arrow key you
09:33 - can come back
09:34 - and then change it here now i change
09:36 - this as minimum
09:38 - and then check this so minimum of a
09:40 - distance
09:42 - is being
09:42 - seen here if you want to check the
09:44 - average similar
09:47 - we will change this min as avg
09:52 - so
09:54 - 28.4000 is the average here
09:58 - if you want to know the number of rows
10:01 - in the table that is total number of
10:03 - rows will be shown
10:05 - select
10:07 - count of
10:09 - star that means
10:11 - all the rows
10:13 - from state
10:15 - so there are five records totally it is
10:17 - shown
10:18 - in case you want to
10:20 - specify only how many rows are there in
10:22 - that particular column
10:24 - then we shall give
10:25 - select
10:27 - count of the column name that is
10:29 - zone
10:30 - of from state
10:36 - actually all the values are available in
10:38 - zone
10:38 - but if we see
10:40 - in the language
10:41 - one language was not available which was
10:44 - for arnold chad
10:46 - so let us change this as
10:49 - language
10:54 - i think there is a spelling mistake
10:56 - there
11:00 - l a n g so let us take l i n g
11:08 - we could see the
11:10 - 4 as there is
11:12 - one lesser that that is null that null
11:15 - says empty
11:17 - distinct function also can be combined
11:19 - with
11:20 - count function for example
11:23 - if we need to count the distinct values
11:26 - of this particular column
11:29 - north east is repeated twice
11:31 - if we want to take only once and then
11:34 - count
11:36 - it will be 4.
11:37 - to do that we can give like this
11:42 - select count of
11:45 - distinct
11:46 - of
11:49 - zone
11:50 - from state
11:53 - so now only the distinct value
11:56 - is been counted and displayed
11:59 - to add the
12:01 - text as a column
12:03 - that is the constant text will be
12:05 - appearing as a new column
12:08 - with all the rows filled with the same
12:10 - text
12:12 - we shall give select column names which
12:15 - are all we need
12:16 - the text in the double quote
12:19 - are even in the single quote from table
12:22 - name for example select state underscore
12:26 - ut
12:28 - area square kilometer into thousand
12:30 - see this is converted into square meters
12:34 - to indicate that i may need
12:37 - square meter to be added in all the
12:40 - rows of that particular column so i add
12:43 - this sqm in the double quote
12:46 - from state
12:47 - another simple query
12:49 - using a new name for the column while
12:52 - displaying the
12:54 - details
12:55 - we shall give select column names and
12:58 - then for whichever you need to change
13:00 - the field name
13:02 - there you will give as
13:04 - the new name from table name
13:08 - otherwise we can also use select column
13:11 - names
13:13 - wherever you need to change
13:14 - without having as keyword we can put the
13:18 - new name inside the double quote or
13:20 - single quote from table name example is
13:23 - here
13:24 - select state underscore ut
13:26 - area square kilometer into thousand
13:30 - if i give this the column heading will
13:32 - be area square kilometer into thousand
13:35 - i don't want to show
13:37 - that as it is
13:39 - i want to change the field name there as
13:42 - area underscore in underscore sqm from
13:46 - state
13:47 - let us execute all these
13:49 - select
13:50 - state
13:51 - underscore ut
13:54 - if i want to multiply the area by
13:56 - thousand
14:00 - from
14:00 - state
14:02 - this is for example i am showing you
14:06 - see the column heading is area in 2000
14:10 - i don't want to see this one instead of
14:12 - this i want to see area in
14:15 - sql
14:17 - for that purpose what i will give
14:19 - as
14:21 - area
14:22 - underscore in
14:25 - underscore sqm
14:27 - if you see this now
14:29 - column heading is being changed as we
14:32 - require here
14:36 - similar way
14:38 - we can also give like this instead of
14:40 - ascii
14:42 - we just put it into the
14:46 - quotation
14:48 - let us check this
14:50 - so again you are getting the same so
14:52 - either you can use this as otherwise
14:55 - within the double quotation
14:59 - one more example like you
15:01 - if you don't want to see this state
15:03 - underscore ut and then just you want to
15:06 - see as only state
15:08 - select
15:10 - state underscore ut
15:14 - as
15:15 - state
15:17 - from state
15:19 - you can see that it is being changed
15:22 - remember these are only views
15:25 - the original table will be as it is
15:29 - now let us use
15:30 - text added into the
15:32 - column
15:34 - same thing i give
15:36 - but instead of giving area in square
15:38 - meter
15:39 - just i show that as
15:42 - area
15:44 - i add a new text column
15:47 - having the
15:48 - same value in all the
15:50 - rows
15:52 - i put it into the code
15:54 - i just add s q dot m
15:58 - you can see the state area
16:02 - this area into thousand i have mentioned
16:05 - as area so area has come here with that
16:09 - i wanted to just put this
16:11 - in
16:12 - all the rows of that particular column
16:15 - we can follow this method for adding a
16:17 - text
16:18 - into a
16:20 - new field remember here
16:24 - if there is no comma
16:26 - then the heading is going to be changed
16:28 - as this if there is a comma
16:31 - then this is going to be a
16:34 - new field added like this
16:36 - so only the comma makes the difference
16:38 - between
16:39 - these two
16:42 - students hope the concept is very clear
16:51 - keep watching this channel
16:53 - keep learning thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back in today's class we are going to continue simple queries of mysql we will discuss performing simple calculations distinct function aggregate functions other simple queries like adding text column in view using alias naming view sometimes we may need to perform simple calculation for example multiplying two numbers or adding two numbers and displaying the result even these can be performed using the selection statement just we can write select and the expression and terminate for example we can write select 10 plus 25 so it will be displaying the result as 35 select 5 into 100 another example how do we apply this in the columns of a table for example particular column is there if we need to multiply the whole column values into some numbers or if we need to find the percentage or we need to convert that into other unit we may need to perform the simple calculations like that we may add the expression to it and then display the result in the view for that we can have a query like this select which are all the column names we need and then the expression with the column name from as usual the table name if we consider the table called state here there are many columns at last if you see area square kilometer if i need to convert that into square meters for that purpose i can multiply that columns value into thousand that particular column all the rows to be multiplied and displayed with the state name how do i perform it i need state as well as the area so i will select these two columns select the column name that is state underscore ut area square kilometer is another column that i need to multiply with thousand so i have multiplied that with thousand from the table name so that is state is the table name when i give this i will be getting the state and the area in square meters i open my sql to perform the basic calculation select 500 multiplied by 10 then terminate this is also a view as a table here 500 into 10 is the field name and the 5000 is the result as an item another example select 70 divided by 10 we are getting that in float data type as it is a division now if we want to apply this in a tables column to access the table first we need to get inside the database i have a database called india i use it there is a table called state let me check all the details of state select star from state if i want to display this state and the area all the values but multiplied by thousand as we saw in the example select state underscore ut comma the next column that is area column area multiplied by thousand from state we can see now values in the area all are multiplied by thousand and displayed distinct function selects the items from the column without any repetition for example if we are taking the table called state here you can see in the zone there are values which are repeated if we want to display these values without any repetition that means the north east we need to have only once not many times just to know how many distinct values are available there in that particular column we can use this statement this can also be combined with other functions syntax is here select distinct and then column name in the bracket from the table name for example if we need to perform zone here select distinct zone from state the column name should be inside the bracket that is distinct is a function here let us perform and check uniquely we will display the zones value select distinct off zone state you can see the values uniquely displayed north east is not repeated let us see the aggregate functions first let us take sum to find the sum of column of a table we shall give select sum of column name from table name for example if we are having this table if we need to take the sum of districts all the districts so it will be adding all the values in the district column and then it will be displaying as one value select sum of districts from state similar way if we want to take average of the particular column we shall give select average of column name from table name again for example select average of area square kilometer from state so it will be giving the average of the last column next finding maximum and minimum value of a column to find the maximum value we will have mbix to find the minimum value we will have min according to neet we shall give column name in the bracket from the table name for example here for maximum maximum of districts that means it will be displaying 38 as it is the highest value similar way if we need a minimum value of districts it will be giving 13 as the answer to count the total number of records from a table we are having count of function this also can be used to count number of values in particular column to display total number of records from a table we give select count of star from table name the example is select count of star from state if we want to count the number of rows in particular column it will exclude the null that means empty select count of column name from table name for example here if you see language column does not have value for this arunachal state it will not count this in the count it will count number of values available in that particular column so it will be showing 4 as the result for that example is here select count of language from state let us perform all these on mysql to select the sum of all the districts which is appearing here we shall give select sum open the bracket districts close the bracket from the table name that is state so we can see 142 is bit displayed there similar way if we want to find the maximum what shall we do we can change this as max so maximum number in the district maximum value will be shown that is 38 if you want to bring the previously typed query we have an option here on the keyboard just press on the upper arrow key you will be getting the previous query if you want to go to previous to that and press once again similarly you can check all the queries and again execute even if you want to modify some query you can use the sideways arrow key you can come back and then change it here now i change this as minimum and then check this so minimum of a distance is being seen here if you want to check the average similar we will change this min as avg so 28.4000 is the average here if you want to know the number of rows in the table that is total number of rows will be shown select count of star that means all the rows from state so there are five records totally it is shown in case you want to specify only how many rows are there in that particular column then we shall give select count of the column name that is zone of from state actually all the values are available in zone but if we see in the language one language was not available which was for arnold chad so let us change this as language i think there is a spelling mistake there l a n g so let us take l i n g we could see the 4 as there is one lesser that that is null that null says empty distinct function also can be combined with count function for example if we need to count the distinct values of this particular column north east is repeated twice if we want to take only once and then count it will be 4. to do that we can give like this select count of distinct of zone from state so now only the distinct value is been counted and displayed to add the text as a column that is the constant text will be appearing as a new column with all the rows filled with the same text we shall give select column names which are all we need the text in the double quote are even in the single quote from table name for example select state underscore ut area square kilometer into thousand see this is converted into square meters to indicate that i may need square meter to be added in all the rows of that particular column so i add this sqm in the double quote from state another simple query using a new name for the column while displaying the details we shall give select column names and then for whichever you need to change the field name there you will give as the new name from table name otherwise we can also use select column names wherever you need to change without having as keyword we can put the new name inside the double quote or single quote from table name example is here select state underscore ut area square kilometer into thousand if i give this the column heading will be area square kilometer into thousand i don't want to show that as it is i want to change the field name there as area underscore in underscore sqm from state let us execute all these select state underscore ut if i want to multiply the area by thousand from state this is for example i am showing you see the column heading is area in 2000 i don't want to see this one instead of this i want to see area in sql for that purpose what i will give as area underscore in underscore sqm if you see this now column heading is being changed as we require here similar way we can also give like this instead of ascii we just put it into the quotation let us check this so again you are getting the same so either you can use this as otherwise within the double quotation one more example like you if you don't want to see this state underscore ut and then just you want to see as only state select state underscore ut as state from state you can see that it is being changed remember these are only views the original table will be as it is now let us use text added into the column same thing i give but instead of giving area in square meter just i show that as area i add a new text column having the same value in all the rows i put it into the code i just add s q dot m you can see the state area this area into thousand i have mentioned as area so area has come here with that i wanted to just put this in all the rows of that particular column we can follow this method for adding a text into a new field remember here if there is no comma then the heading is going to be changed as this if there is a comma then this is going to be a new field added like this so only the comma makes the difference between these two students hope the concept is very clear keep watching this channel keep learning thank you
