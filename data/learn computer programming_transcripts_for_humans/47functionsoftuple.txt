00:04 - [Laughter]
00:16 - hello everyone in this class we are
00:19 - going to see functions of
00:23 - tles comparing to Strings and lists we
00:26 - are having very less functions in the
00:29 - tles
00:31 - Len of which is common to any sequence
00:34 - which gives the length of the given
00:36 - sequence so even tle also it does the
00:39 - same job when I give a tle which is
00:42 - called days here and then I have
00:45 - mentioned three letters of
00:48 - days Len of days will return seven here
00:53 - as seven elements are in this tle next I
00:56 - am having index of tle do index of the
00:59 - element the value we give it will be
01:02 - returning
01:03 - the index number of that particular
01:06 - element which it occurs at the first
01:08 - time in the tle in case more than once
01:11 - it is
01:12 - repeated it will take only the first one
01:15 - days. index of THU I have given so index
01:20 - number starts from zero THU is
01:24 - 4 next we are having count off it gives
01:28 - the occurrence of AR argument that how
01:30 - many times it repeats or we can also say
01:34 - it is nothing but a frequency here just
01:36 - to understand I have made one small
01:37 - change in the previous stle I made that
01:40 - Saturday to Sunday again so there are
01:43 - two times available I have given same
01:45 - thing into the example days. count of su
01:49 - it will return
01:51 - two next
01:53 - one we are having sorted of tle it
01:57 - Returns the sorted list it is not going
01:59 - going to be a tle because tle is
02:02 - immutable and then we also know that
02:05 - sorted always returns it does not change
02:08 - the original sequence sorted of days
02:11 - sorted list we
02:14 - get in case we need that in descending
02:17 - order to be sorted we can also give
02:20 - reverse is equal to
02:23 - true so sorted of days comma reverse is
02:27 - equal to True remember is a keyword then
02:31 - that is a Boolean literal so it is in
02:33 - reverse order that is in descending
02:37 - order we can also have the aggregate
02:41 - functions that is sum minimum and
02:45 - maximum if integers or any number types
02:48 - are there then only it will give the
02:50 - some
02:51 - otherwise if it is mixed or it is only
02:54 - string and then it is going to return
02:56 - the error I have given 10 is equal to 10
03:00 - 20 30 40
03:01 - 50 sum of
03:04 - 10 so the sum here is 150 it is
03:07 - returning that Max will return the
03:11 - maximum value that is 50
03:15 - here it returns that similar way Min
03:18 - will return minimum value which is
03:23 - 10 at last we are having a tle of
03:26 - function which converts any other
03:28 - sequence into a
03:30 - for example I have a list
03:33 - here D see there it is a list it is not
03:38 - a tle now I give tle of D it returns a
03:44 - tle if string is there then you are
03:47 - changing into tle each element that is
03:50 - each character will become an element
03:52 - and then it returns a
03:54 - tle let us execute everything on this
03:57 - ideally let me create a tle called
03:59 - material are
04:01 - mat
04:03 - pen
04:05 - paper
04:07 - pencil
04:10 - marker cutter so first one if I want to
04:14 - get the length of this Len of
04:18 - M it gives five as there are five
04:22 - elements if I want to know the index
04:25 - number of particular element I will be
04:28 - giving m
04:30 - dot index of the argument inside the
04:35 - bracket I say pencil
04:38 - here so I get the index
04:42 - number in case there are two similar
04:45 - things it will give
04:48 - only the first one let us even check
04:51 - that I give one more
04:53 - paper in
04:58 - between now Matt do index
05:03 - of paper I okay paper is available in
05:08 - the index number one so it is going to
05:10 - show that only not the next one now let
05:14 - me use the count of
05:16 - mat dot count off this will be giving
05:19 - the
05:20 - frequency there are two times paper so
05:24 - I'm giving it to get the result so it is
05:28 - two now let us execute sorted off sorted
05:32 - off
05:36 - mat so you could see that it is a
05:39 - list and then C is the first one and
05:42 - then M so two times it is available
05:45 - paper pen and pencil if I need that to
05:49 - be sorted in descending order I can
05:52 - give sorted of M
05:56 - comma reverse is equal to true
06:01 - so it is in reverse order that is in
06:03 - descending order if all are strings it
06:07 - will be getting sorted according to
06:09 - lexico graphical method in case
06:13 - numbers if I say noos equal to
06:18 - 650 -
06:22 - 485 200
06:26 - 1 so now I say sorted off
06:33 - no so it is according to the
06:35 - value in case we need in reverse order
06:38 - we can give
06:40 - again
06:43 - sorted
06:44 - NOS with reverse is equal to
06:52 - True right so in case we are having
06:56 - strings as well the numbers
07:01 - I just make some changes I make it as
07:05 - temp and then I remove some of this from
07:08 - here I remove it and then I also use
07:12 - some numbers in
07:14 - between
07:16 - 40
07:18 - 35 so here let me give
07:22 - 50 - 200 so sorted
07:26 - off
07:28 - temp so this will be giving you a error
07:33 - message now let us see the aggregate
07:37 - functions numbers are with purely
07:40 - numbers so I will be giving sum of
07:46 - N so it is
07:48 - 338 you can check it Max
07:53 - of no so here 200 minan of
08:00 - no it is
08:02 - minus so in this aggregate function what
08:06 - happens if it is only
08:08 - strings so strings we are having
08:12 - in
08:14 - mat right I give Max of mat lexico
08:19 - graphically it will check which is the
08:21 - highest one and then returns so pencil
08:24 - is the highest one it will be comparing
08:26 - according to the asky value Min
08:30 - of
08:32 - M we cannot have the sum of this it will
08:36 - give
08:37 - error now let me have the string name is
08:41 - equal to I am just giving any
08:45 - name VI
08:48 - raaan now I make this as tle okay so tle
08:53 - of name will return the tle having each
08:58 - character as one name element
09:00 - there in case if I have a list for
09:03 - example no equal
09:06 - to 1 2 3 4 5 then I change it to a tle
09:12 - or I can also put in another
09:14 - variable num is equal
09:17 - to tle of
09:20 - no sorry I need to give tle and new m is
09:25 - equal
09:27 - to tle of
09:30 - a
09:31 - noise so now if I give num we will get a
09:38 - tle hope the concepts are very clear to
09:42 - you let us meet in the next
09:45 - class thank
09:52 - you

gives the occurrence of AR argument that how many times it repeats or we can also say it is nothing but a frequency here just to understand I have made one small change in the previous stle I made

list it is not going going to be a tle because tle is immutable and then we also know that sorted always returns it does not change the original sequence sorted of days sorted list we get in case we need that in descending order to be sorted we can also give reverse is equal to true so sorted of days comma reverse is equal to True remember is a keyword then that is a Boolean literal so it is in

if it is mixed or it is only string and then it is going to return the error I have given 10 is equal to 10 20 30 40 50 sum of 10 so the sum here is 150 it is returning that Max will return the maximum value that is 50 here it returns that similar way Min will return minimum value which is 10 at last we are having a tle of function which converts any other sequence into a for example I have a list here D see there it is a list it is not a tle now I give tle of D it returns a tle if string is there then you are changing into tle each element that is each character will become an element and then it returns a tle let us execute everything on this ideally let me create a tle called material are mat pen paper pencil marker cutter so first one if I want to get the length of this Len of M it gives five as there are five elements if I want to know the index number of particular element I will be giving m dot index of the argument inside the bracket I say pencil here so I get the index number in case there are two similar things it will give only the first one let us even check that I give one more paper in between now Matt do index of paper I okay paper is available in the index number one so it is going to show that only not the next one now let me use the count of mat dot count off this will be giving the frequency there are two times paper so I'm giving it to get the result so it is two now let us execute sorted off sorted off mat so you could see that it is a list and then C is the first one and then M so two times it is available paper pen and pencil if I need that to be sorted in descending order I can give sorted of M comma reverse is equal to true so it is in reverse order that is in descending order if all are strings it will be getting sorted according to lexico graphical method in case numbers if I say noos equal to 650 485 200 1 so now I say sorted off no so it is according to the value in case we need in reverse order we can give again sorted NOS with reverse is equal to True right so in case we are having strings as well the numbers I just make some changes I make it as temp and then I remove some of this from here I remove it and then I also use some numbers in between 40 35 so here let me give 50 200 so sorted off temp so this will be giving you a error message now let us see the aggregate functions numbers are with purely numbers so I will be giving sum of N so it is 338 you can check it Max of no so here 200 minan of no it is minus so in this aggregate function what happens if it is only strings so strings we are having in mat right I give Max of mat lexico graphically it will check which is the highest one and then returns so pencil is the highest one it will be comparing according to the asky value Min of M we cannot have the sum of this it will give error now let me have the string name is equal to I am just giving any name VI raaan now I make this as tle okay so tle of name will return the tle having each character as one name element there in case if I have a list for example no equal to 1 2 3 4 5 then I change it to a tle or I can also put in another variable num is equal to tle of no sorry I need to give tle and new m is equal to tle of a noise so now if I give num we will get a tle hope the concepts are very clear to you let us meet in the next class thank you
