00:00 - hello everyone in this class we are
00:02 - going to learn about
00:03 - mathematical functions in python to use
00:06 - mathematical functions
00:07 - we need math module that means math
00:10 - module provides
00:11 - access to the mathematical functions now
00:13 - you may have a question that what is the
00:15 - module
00:16 - module is nothing but python file which
00:19 - is having the extension
00:20 - dot py there are several modules
00:22 - available in python library
00:24 - some are available by default some we
00:27 - need to import
00:28 - to use mathematical functions math model
00:31 - to be important
00:32 - statement to import math module is very
00:34 - simple
00:35 - import a keyword and math is the module
00:38 - name so these two words you need to
00:40 - write
00:41 - before using the mathematical functions
00:43 - of pytha
00:44 - i have listed here most commonly used
00:46 - mathematical functions
00:48 - first one math dot sqrt and then one
00:51 - argument is given
00:52 - so this will be returning the square
00:54 - root of number given
00:56 - for example here math dot sqrt of
01:00 - 49 so the square root of 49 is 7
01:03 - the output will be given using the
01:05 - floating point data type that is 7.0
01:08 - next we are having math dot see love
01:11 - this will be returning the nearest
01:13 - integer
01:14 - by rounding up that means for example if
01:16 - we are having two point two
01:18 - see point two is lesser than five though
01:21 - it is lesser than five it will not
01:23 - consider to
01:24 - go to nearest integer as 2 it will go to
01:27 - the highest integer that means
01:29 - 3 on the number line next we are having
01:33 - floor this will be returning the integer
01:36 - by rounding down the number any decimal
01:39 - part will be just neglected and only the
01:42 - integer will be
01:43 - returned here these two are having
01:46 - integer data type as
01:47 - output you can easily remember these two
01:50 - functions
01:50 - by remembering our day to day life
01:53 - ceiling which is above
01:54 - us floor which is below us next we are
01:57 - having
01:57 - pow that means it gives the power
02:00 - two arguments one is the base and the
02:03 - other one is the power
02:04 - that means it returns x raised to the
02:07 - power y for example
02:08 - 2 comma 3 is there that means 2 into 2
02:11 - into 2
02:12 - that is 8 the output will be as floating
02:14 - data type
02:16 - next we are having math.exp this will be
02:19 - giving
02:19 - the power raised to e each value is a
02:23 - constant which is given here
02:24 - for example if we are having math dot
02:27 - exp
02:28 - of 5 then it will be returning the value
02:30 - which you see here
02:32 - next math dot f a b s that is absolute
02:36 - value absolute value is nothing but the
02:38 - position of the number
02:40 - from 0 on the number line either it may
02:43 - be left side or the right side so that
02:45 - means
02:46 - it doesn't look for the negative or
02:48 - positive
02:49 - just it sees only the position so this
02:52 - will be used
02:52 - to convert a negative value into
02:54 - positive value most of the time
02:56 - here for example minus 23 will be giving
03:00 - 23 as the result in floating point data
03:03 - type
03:04 - next math dot log of
03:07 - here you can have either one argument
03:10 - or two arguments if you are giving one
03:13 - argument
03:14 - and then it will be giving the natural
03:16 - logarithm of
03:17 - a number to the base e otherwise you can
03:20 - also give the base
03:22 - math dot log of 12 so that is natural
03:25 - logarithm of 12 will be returning
03:28 - next we are having log 10 of x that
03:32 - means it will be
03:33 - returning the base 10 logarithm of x so
03:36 - it will be more accurate than
03:37 - if you are giving x comma 10 in the
03:40 - previous one
03:41 - next we are having two angle related
03:44 - functions first one is degrees
03:46 - so it will be converting radians to
03:48 - degrees
03:49 - for example math dot degrees of 0.62
03:52 - will be returning the value which you
03:54 - see here
03:54 - to convert from degrees to radians we
03:57 - use this
03:58 - convert angle x from degrees to radians
04:02 - for example radians of 40 is given there
04:05 - next we are also having the
04:07 - trigonometric function
04:09 - sine cos and tan sine x will be
04:11 - returning the sine of
04:13 - x radians it is not degrees remember
04:15 - this is radians
04:16 - math dot sine of 90 will be returning
04:19 - the value which you see here
04:20 - and then cos of x which returns the
04:23 - cosine of
04:24 - x radians example is given then
04:27 - similarly math dot tan is also there
04:29 - with the example we can also get the
04:32 - constants
04:33 - for example we are having math dot pi so
04:36 - this will be returning the
04:38 - constant value of pi up to 15
04:41 - decimal places similarly math dot
04:44 - e so that is ease value it will be
04:46 - returning
04:47 - up to 15 decimal places let us check all
04:50 - these functions using
04:54 - python
04:57 - to use mathematical functions we need to
04:59 - import
05:00 - math module so we write first import
05:04 - math once we import the math module we
05:07 - don't need to write again and again
05:09 - every time we use mathematical function
05:11 - until the end of this session
05:13 - this import math statement will work in
05:16 - case
05:17 - in the program it is been imported from
05:19 - the point of
05:20 - this statement until the end of the
05:22 - program any mathematical functions can
05:24 - be used
05:25 - basically if you decide to use
05:27 - mathematical function
05:29 - in a program and then in the beginning
05:31 - itself importing is good
05:33 - now let us start with sqrt math
05:36 - dot sqrt that is square root of a number
05:39 - for example i am giving 81 and then nine
05:43 - nines are 81 so 9.0 will be returning
05:46 - next i have math dot floor of
05:49 - 90.9 iq see floor is the
05:52 - lower one so it will be rounding to
05:56 - 90 though 0.9 is higher than 0.5
05:59 - mathematically it will be rounding as 91
06:02 - but when we are using floor it will
06:04 - round down so 90 will be the answer
06:06 - next math dot seal of i am using 50.2
06:11 - see 0.2 is lesser comparing to 0.5
06:14 - though it is lesser it will be rounding
06:16 - to higher integer that is 51.
06:18 - next power math dot pow
06:22 - i can have two arguments for example i
06:24 - am giving 5 comma
06:26 - 3 so 5 into 5 into 5
06:29 - 5 is 25 25 phaser 125
06:33 - next i have exp math dot exp
06:37 - of 2 if i give e to the power 2
06:40 - this is the value it returns next math
06:43 - dot f a b s that is absolute value
06:47 - as i said it is mostly used to convert
06:49 - from negative value to positive value
06:51 - for example i am giving minus 45 so
06:54 - position from 0
06:56 - though it is left side it is just
06:58 - getting the position
06:59 - so 45 it is returning note down the
07:02 - output data type also
07:04 - except floor and seal all these are
07:06 - returning
07:07 - floating point data type next we will
07:10 - see logarithmics
07:12 - math dot log of 25 if i give it gives
07:16 - natural logarithmic of
07:17 - 25 if i need a base if i mention
07:21 - base as 10 math dot log of
07:24 - 25 comma 10 this is the value to return
07:28 - we are also having math
07:30 - dot log 10 it is same as previous one
07:33 - with base 10 we have given but here this
07:36 - will be having
07:37 - more accurate value than previous one
07:40 - same
07:40 - 25 if i give so you can see
07:43 - at last it is giving little better value
07:47 - math dot log of
07:51 - 100 comma 2 so that is base i give
07:55 - 2 then this is the value which it
07:57 - returns next
07:58 - related to angles math dot degrees
08:02 - of say 2.2 radians 2.2 will be converted
08:06 - into degrees
08:07 - so that is 126.050 and so on degrees
08:10 - converting from degrees to
08:12 - radians math dot radians
08:16 - of say 45
08:20 - so this is the radian of 45 degree
08:24 - now trigonometric functions math dot
08:28 - sine of say 3.5 radians so the argument
08:31 - is in radians
08:32 - not degrees so this is the value which
08:34 - returns next
08:35 - math dot cosine that is cos
08:39 - of for example like you 90 here
08:42 - so this is the value which it gives and
08:44 - then math dot
08:47 - tan of 25
08:50 - so to get the constants that is math dot
08:53 - pi
08:54 - math dot pi if i give it gives the value
08:57 - of
08:58 - pi up to 15 decimal places similarly
09:01 - math dot
09:02 - e as i said these are only the
09:06 - common mathematical functions there are
09:08 - still lots of
09:10 - mathematical functions available i have
09:12 - made as a document
09:13 - and then given the link in the
09:15 - description if you want to check
09:17 - all the mathematical functions please
09:19 - download the document and then you can
09:21 - know about more mathematical functions
09:23 - available in python
09:26 - keep watching my videos and learn more
09:29 - thank you
09:40 - you

hello everyone in this class we are going to learn about mathematical functions in python to use mathematical functions we need math module that means math module provides access to the mathematical functions now you may have a question that what is the module module is nothing but python file which is having the extension dot py there are several modules available in python library some are available by default some we need to import to use mathematical functions math model to be important statement to import math module is very simple import a keyword and math is the module name so these two words you need to write before using the mathematical functions of pytha i have listed here most commonly used mathematical functions first one math dot sqrt and then one argument is given so this will be returning the square root of number given for example here math dot sqrt of 49 so the square root of 49 is 7 the output will be given using the floating point data type that is 7.0 next we are having math dot see love this will be returning the nearest integer by rounding up that means for example if we are having two point two see point two is lesser than five though it is lesser than five it will not consider to go to nearest integer as 2 it will go to the highest integer that means 3 on the number line next we are having floor this will be returning the integer by rounding down the number any decimal part will be just neglected and only the integer will be returned here these two are having integer data type as output you can easily remember these two functions by remembering our day to day life ceiling which is above us floor which is below us next we are having pow that means it gives the power two arguments one is the base and the other one is the power that means it returns x raised to the power y for example 2 comma 3 is there that means 2 into 2 into 2 that is 8 the output will be as floating data type next we are having math.exp this will be giving the power raised to e each value is a constant which is given here for example if we are having math dot exp of 5 then it will be returning the value which you see here next math dot f a b s that is absolute value absolute value is nothing but the position of the number from 0 on the number line either it may be left side or the right side so that means it doesn't look for the negative or positive just it sees only the position so this will be used to convert a negative value into positive value most of the time here for example minus 23 will be giving 23 as the result in floating point data type next math dot log of here you can have either one argument or two arguments if you are giving one argument and then it will be giving the natural logarithm of a number to the base e otherwise you can also give the base math dot log of 12 so that is natural logarithm of 12 will be returning next we are having log 10 of x that means it will be returning the base 10 logarithm of x so it will be more accurate than if you are giving x comma 10 in the previous one next we are having two angle related functions first one is degrees so it will be converting radians to degrees for example math dot degrees of 0.62 will be returning the value which you see here to convert from degrees to radians we use this convert angle x from degrees to radians for example radians of 40 is given there next we are also having the trigonometric function sine cos and tan sine x will be returning the sine of x radians it is not degrees remember this is radians math dot sine of 90 will be returning the value which you see here and then cos of x which returns the cosine of x radians example is given then similarly math dot tan is also there with the example we can also get the constants for example we are having math dot pi so this will be returning the constant value of pi up to 15 decimal places similarly math dot e so that is ease value it will be returning up to 15 decimal places let us check all these functions using python to use mathematical functions we need to import math module so we write first import math once we import the math module we don't need to write again and again every time we use mathematical function until the end of this session this import math statement will work in case in the program it is been imported from the point of this statement until the

sqrt math dot sqrt that is square root of a number for example i am giving 81 and then nine nines are 81 so 9.0 will be returning next i have math dot floor of 90.9 iq see floor is the lower one so it will be rounding to 90 though 0.9 is higher than 0.5 mathematically it will be rounding as 91 but when we are using floor it will round down so 90 will be the answer next math dot seal of i am using 50.2 see 0.2 is lesser comparing to 0.5 though it is lesser it will be rounding to higher integer that is 51. next power math dot pow i can have two arguments for example i am giving 5 comma 3 so 5 into 5 into 5 5 is 25 25 phaser 125 next i have exp math dot exp of 2 if i give e to the power 2 this is the value it returns next math dot f a b s that is absolute value as i said it is mostly used to convert from negative value to positive value for example i am giving minus 45 so position from 0 though it is left side it is just getting the position so 45 it is returning note down the output data type also except floor and seal all these are returning floating point data type next we will see logarithmics math dot log of 25 if i give it gives natural logarithmic of 25 if i need a base if i mention base as 10 math dot log of 25 comma 10 this is the value to return we are also having math dot log 10 it is same as previous one with base 10 we have given but here this will be having more accurate value than previous one same 25 if i give so you can see at last it is giving little better value math dot log of 100 comma 2 so that is base i give 2 then this is the value which it returns next related to angles math dot degrees of say 2.2 radians 2.2 will be converted into degrees so that is 126.050 and so on degrees converting from degrees to radians math dot radians of say 45 so this is the radian of 45 degree now trigonometric functions math dot sine of say 3.5 radians so the argument is in radians not degrees so this is the value which returns next math dot cosine that is cos of for example like you 90 here so this is the value which it gives and then math dot tan of 25 so to get the constants that is math dot pi math dot pi if i give it gives the value of pi up to 15 decimal places similarly math dot e as i said these are only the common mathematical functions there are still lots of mathematical functions available i have made as a document and then given the link in the description if you want to check all the mathematical functions please download the document and then you can know about more mathematical functions available in python keep watching my videos and
