00:01 - welcome back students we will continue
00:05 - string functions today the remaining
00:09 - string functions that is substring and
00:12 - compare two functions we are going to
00:15 - see substring will accept two integer
00:18 - arguments are a single integer argument
00:21 - integer value they are given is the
00:24 - index number here it accepts one single
00:28 - integer value that is indexed number of
00:31 - the character present in the string this
00:35 - is taken as starting index and the
00:37 - remaining all the index characters will
00:40 - get displayed so the output data type
00:43 - will be string type for example we have
00:47 - chabad.org of 3 here we have 0 1 2 and
00:55 - then 3 is the argument given so from
00:58 - starting 3 that is be remaining
01:02 - everything it is going to be taken so
01:05 - output here will be board next we have
01:10 - here two integer argument that is 2
01:14 - index number this is a starting index
01:16 - number and this is ending index number
01:18 - so again output type is going to be
01:20 - string type for example if we take
01:23 - Chabad dot
01:25 - comma 3 so the starting is 0 so the 3 is
01:31 - not included in the output so it is
01:34 - going to take 0 1 & 2 so it will have 0
01:38 - see new peepees to be that is 3 is
01:43 - excluded here so you will have o to -
01:47 - see you P first
01:51 - let us check this throw a program and
01:53 - then we will learn compare to function
01:57 - these quotes already you know I have
02:01 - taken input from the user the variable
02:04 - name given to the string is yes 1 so I
02:07 - am going to take the output I give
02:10 - string yes
02:12 - - is equal to so the string value that
02:16 - is s1 given by the user dot substring of
02:20 - the value IQ for example IQ for you then
02:25 - I turn it so I will print this that is
02:50 - s2
02:51 - now let us consider string yes three is
02:56 - equal to s1 dot substring of six comma
03:04 - nine so let me print this again six end
03:19 - till nine is s3 is the answer so I give
03:29 - here dictionary so what is going to be
03:33 - the output we have given substring s5
03:38 - here so 0 1 2 3 4 5 so the fifth index
03:45 - starts from whoa
03:47 - so o n ary is going to be the first
03:51 - output and the next output going to be 6
03:55 - to 9 so it is going to be n a our so Y
04:01 - is 9 that is excluded
04:11 - before learning compared to let us learn
04:14 - about ASCII code of characters compared
04:18 - to function going to compare two strings
04:22 - using ASCII value of the character so
04:26 - here we have the ASCII value of each
04:29 - character from 0 to 9 0 48 is the ASCII
04:35 - value for 149 and then so on so for 9 it
04:40 - is 57 then for capital a it starts from
04:45 - 65 66 67 like that and then up to Z it
04:49 - is 98 same like that a small letter A
04:53 - has 97's its value and then Z has 122 as
05:00 - its value compared to function going to
05:03 - compare two strings lexicographically
05:07 - that means as in the dictionary it is
05:10 - going to compare so here we have
05:14 - compared to T is in capital here the
05:18 - output is going to be integer type after
05:21 - comparing this function not only
05:24 - compares lexicographically but also
05:27 - compares the length of the string I will
05:30 - explain with some examples here when you
05:36 - the first string dark compared to the
05:40 - second string inside the bracket for
05:44 - example I have mouse is the first string
05:48 - value dot compared to the second string
05:52 - value here as book here see the first
05:57 - letter of this is M and the first letter
06:02 - is B here so the ASCII value of VM is
06:07 - 109 and ASCII value of B is 98 so the
06:12 - difference between these going to be
06:15 - given so that is 109 minus 98 is going
06:20 - to be 11
06:22 - in case here it is book and here it is
06:25 - mouse it is going to do 98 - 1 not 9 so
06:31 - that is going to be
06:32 - - 11 the next example here I have money
06:39 - bad and then money purse so as per the
06:44 - dictionary money until that both are
06:47 - same so be here it starts a different
06:50 - letter here it is P is different letter
06:53 - so it is going to consider the ASCII
06:55 - value of B - ASCII value of P so here B
07:00 - has 98 as its value P has 102 or less
07:05 - its value so 98 - 112 is - 14 next here
07:13 - I have pencil dot compared to pen so it
07:19 - is going to compare these two see here
07:22 - pin is already there in the pencil later
07:25 - on whatever the character is available
07:27 - in pencil is not there here it is going
07:29 - to compare the length so that is pencils
07:33 - length is 6 and the pin length is 3 so 6
07:39 - minus 3 it is going to be 3 is the
07:42 - output next I have here record compare
07:49 - to record so both are same the output is
07:52 - going to be 0 let us do all these
07:57 - through a program let me delete all
08:01 - these so here I will change as user
08:08 - input that is BR dot readline now so
08:15 - here I have two inputs before this I
08:18 - will prompt so I enter another string
08:27 - another string so you sir you see as
08:29 - soon as one string and yes to s other
08:31 - string I am just comparing directly I
08:34 - give in the printing statement so that
08:52 - is I am giving here yes
08:56 - one dot compared to that is yes to let
09:04 - us compile this no syntax error as we
09:12 - have seen in the example I give mouse
09:15 - then book so 11 was the answer there
09:20 - you got this next let me give the other
09:25 - type of input
09:27 - let me you money back then money person
09:35 - so you can see minus 40 as we have seen
09:39 - in the example so now I you pencil and
09:46 - then pin so it is length now 6 minus 3
09:50 - is 3
09:53 - next let us give the same input for
09:58 - example most most so it is 0 so here I
10:06 - have see 80 compared to a and T so it is
10:11 - totally different the first letter it is
10:13 - going to be C and then here a the
10:19 - difference going to be these two is two
10:21 - the next one here cellphone dot compare
10:26 - to sell pouch CR minus 7 is answer
10:35 - so until CLP it is same and then here
10:39 - hit and here
10:40 - boy is compared so here H is having
10:43 - smaller value boy is having bigger value
10:46 - so it is in - value so - seven and then
10:54 - here I am comparing pencil and pin we
10:56 - have already seen so it is three and
10:59 - then here block and block so both are
11:02 - same it is going to be zero students we
11:05 - have seen many string functions all
11:08 - these will help you in doing the
11:11 - programs we will see example program in
11:16 - coming tutorials
11:17 - so until then thank you please keep on
11:21 - watching my videos bye

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back students we will continue string functions today the remaining string functions that is substring and compare two functions we are going to see substring will accept two integer arguments are a single integer argument integer value they are given is the index number here it accepts one single integer value that is indexed number of the character present in the string this is taken as starting index and the remaining all the index characters will get displayed so the output data type will be string type for example we have chabad.org of 3 here we have 0 1 2 and then 3 is the argument given so from starting 3 that is be remaining everything it is going to be taken so output here will be board next we have here two integer argument that is 2 index number this is a starting index number and this is ending index number so again output type is going to be string type for example if we take Chabad dot comma 3 so the starting is 0 so the 3 is not included in the output so it is going to take 0 1 & 2 so it will have 0 see new peepees to be that is 3 is excluded here so you will have o to see you P first let us check this throw a program and then we will learn compare to function these quotes already you know I have taken input from the user the variable name given to the string is yes 1 so I am going to take the output I give string yes is equal to so the string value that is s1 given by the user dot substring of the value IQ for example IQ for you then I turn it so I will print this that is s2 now let us consider string yes three is equal to s1 dot substring of six comma nine so let me print this again six end till nine is s3 is the answer so I give here dictionary so what is going to be the output we have given substring s5 here so 0 1 2 3 4 5 so the fifth index starts from whoa so o n ary is going to be the first output and the next output going to be 6 to 9 so it is going to be n a our so Y is 9 that is excluded before learning compared to let us learn about ASCII code of characters compared to function going to compare two strings using ASCII value of the character so here we have the ASCII value of each character from 0 to 9 0 48 is the ASCII value for 149 and then so on so for 9 it is 57 then for capital a it starts from 65 66 67 like that and then up to Z it is 98 same like that a small letter A has 97's its value and then Z has 122 as its value compared to function going to compare two strings lexicographically that means as in the dictionary it is going to compare so here we have compared to T is in capital here the output is going to be integer type after comparing this function not only compares lexicographically but also compares the length of the string I will explain with some examples here when you the first string dark compared to the second string inside the bracket for example I have mouse is the first string value dot compared to the second string value here as book here see the first letter of this is M and the first letter is B here so the ASCII value of VM is 109 and ASCII value of B is 98 so the difference between these going to be given so that is 109 minus 98 is going to be 11 in case here it is book and here it is mouse it is going to do 98 1 not 9 so that is going to be 11 the next example here I have money bad and then money purse so as per the dictionary money until that both are same so be here it starts a different letter here it is P is different letter so it is going to consider the ASCII value of B ASCII value of P so here B has 98 as its value P has 102 or less its value so 98 112 is 14 next here I have pencil dot compared to pen so it is going to compare these two see here pin is already there in the pencil later on whatever the character is available in pencil is not there here it is going to compare the length so that is pencils length is 6 and the pin length is 3 so 6 minus 3 it is going to be 3 is the output next I have here record compare to record so both are same the output is going to be 0 let us do all these through a program let me delete all these so here I will change as user input that is BR dot readline now so here I have two inputs before this I will prompt so I enter another string another string so you sir you see as soon as one string and yes to s other string I am just comparing directly I give in the printing statement so that is I am giving here yes one dot compared to that is yes to let us compile this no syntax error as we have seen in the example I give mouse then book so 11 was the answer there you got this next let me give the other type of input let me you money back then money person so you can see minus 40 as we have seen in the example so now I you pencil and then pin so it is length now 6 minus 3 is 3 next let us give the same input for example most most so it is 0 so here I have see 80 compared to a and T so it is totally different the first letter it is going to be C and then here a the difference going to be these two is two the next one here cellphone dot compare to sell pouch CR minus 7 is answer so until CLP it is same and then here hit and here boy is compared so here H is having smaller value boy is having bigger value so it is in value so seven and then here I am comparing pencil and pin we have already seen so it is three and then here block and block so both are same it is going to be zero students we have seen many string functions all these will help you in doing the programs we will see example program in coming tutorials so until then thank you please keep on watching my videos bye
