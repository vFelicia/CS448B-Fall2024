00:00 - this is my first tutorial class I am
00:02 - going to tell you about opening bluej
00:05 - creating project as well as creating a
00:09 - program so after installing bluej click
00:14 - on browser icon browser gets opened so
00:21 - any class to be created must be inside
00:25 - the project so we have to create a
00:27 - project click on project new project so
00:32 - we get a dialog box where we can give
00:35 - the name of the project for example I am
00:38 - giving learner and then click on create
00:41 - so we get a prove the project here so
00:45 - you can see that learner heading here so
00:50 - to create a class click on new class or
00:53 - right click on the window anywhere and
00:56 - then click on new class you get a dialog
00:59 - box again make sure that class is
01:03 - selected by default class will be
01:05 - selected and then click OK
01:14 - so here you can see the icon this is the
01:18 - class program so to open it and edit the
01:22 - course double-click on it or right-click
01:25 - and open editor you can see already
01:29 - written course there which is the cell
01:32 - skeleton alpha code according to the
01:35 - name given to the class as a beginner we
01:39 - are not going to take all these codes so
01:42 - we just drill it all the codes and then
01:46 - we are going to start a program it is
01:49 - good practice to start a program with a
01:51 - comment line there are two types of
01:54 - comment lines given in Java program one
01:57 - is with double slash and other one is
02:02 - starting with slash and star many lines
02:06 - and then I mean it is going to end with
02:08 - star and slash so if only one line is
02:13 - been given then just we start us with a
02:16 - double slash after the double slash
02:19 - whatever is written is going to be a
02:23 - comment line which is not going to be
02:26 - executed or compiled when Java is going
02:32 - to compile the program so we start a
02:35 - command line say this is my first
02:41 - program bringing like always the program
02:49 - starts with class name class name is
02:52 - going to be a program name or any
02:54 - program name you wanted to do you must
02:57 - do that as a class name class we have
03:00 - already given the class name as my first
03:05 - program we can use the same name my
03:09 - first program RS if we give some other
03:15 - name YUM FP when it is going to compile
03:22 - it will take the new name and then world
03:25 - name is changed to the new name which is
03:27 - given it say the program and then we
03:30 - open a curly bracket class must have at
03:34 - least one method here we are going to
03:37 - learn a standard method called main
03:39 - method in the beginning of the learning
03:41 - just we can follow the course as given
03:45 - and then later we will come to know what
03:47 - are the words what are the keywords
03:49 - which is used for which purpose so now
03:53 - we are having a method for main method
03:56 - with public static void main of string
04:02 - of arguments so here we have keywords
04:07 - called public static void main
04:11 - so here mean is the name of the method
04:14 - and all these are keywords Java is
04:17 - case-sensitive so the keywords to be
04:21 - returned very carefully with that same
04:23 - spelling whether it is a perky
04:26 - our lawyer case so here the public
04:29 - static void all these three are with
04:32 - only lower cases in the string only yes
04:36 - is capital and then ours that is
04:39 - arguments all are with small arrests so
04:42 - you need with that we right we must have
04:45 - a block of quartz which is open with the
04:49 - curly bracket and then we are going to
04:51 - write the codes their actions there so
04:55 - we are going to just print one line so
04:58 - we are going to write a printing
05:00 - statement system dot out dot print line
05:07 - off then we terminate the action or a
05:12 - single statement which is to be
05:15 - terminated with the semicolon so this is
05:19 - going to create a new line so print
05:23 - lines are print we can give print line
05:25 - means after the output it is going to
05:27 - create a new line this is a empty
05:32 - statement when nothing is written to
05:35 - print so whatever to printer to be given
05:38 - inside the quotation we give here inside
05:41 - the quotation video hello welcome to
05:48 - Java and then we close the method here
05:56 - and then we close the class
05:59 - so this is going to be a first program
06:01 - let us compare this there is no syntax
06:09 - error so we close this window and then
06:11 - right click on this we run the method
06:14 - can't avoid me so there is no argument
06:18 - just click on ok so we get hello welcome
06:22 - to Java in the same program I would also
06:26 - like to tell you about print and print
06:29 - line the difference between print and
06:30 - print line so if we create one more line
06:35 - are print one more line here
06:50 - this was how I printed your line so when
06:58 - we don't give print line here in the
07:01 - first statement the output is going to
07:04 - be in the same line it is not going to
07:07 - be in a fresh line for the next
07:09 - statement this is the difference
07:12 - compiled no syntax error and close this
07:17 - right-click wide me so you can see hello
07:23 - welcome to Java this was how printer
07:25 - deadlines I hope you learnt the first
07:34 - program how it is created an executor
07:37 - Thank You students keep watching my

this is my first tutorial class I am going to tell you about opening bluej creating project as well as creating a program so after installing bluej click on browser icon browser gets opened so any class to be created must be inside the project so we have to create a project click on project new project so we get a dialog box where we can give the name of the project for example I am giving learner and then click on create so we get a prove the project here so you can see that learner heading here so to create a class click on new class or right click on the window anywhere and then click on new class you get a dialog box again make sure that class is selected by default class will be selected and then click OK so here you can see the icon this is the class program so to open it and edit the course doubleclick on it or rightclick and open editor you can see already written course there which is the cell skeleton alpha code according to the name given to the class as a beginner we are not going to take all these codes so we just drill it all the codes and then we are going to start a program it is good practice to start a program with a comment line there are two types of comment lines given in Java program one is with double slash and other one is starting with slash and star many lines and then I mean it is going to end with star and slash so if only one line is been given then just we start us with a double slash after the double slash whatever is written is going to be a comment line which is not going to be executed or compiled when Java is going to compile the program so we start a command line say this is my first program bringing like always the program starts with class name class name is going to be a program name or any program name you wanted to do you must do that as a class name class we have already given the class name as my first program we can use the same name my first program RS if we give some other name YUM FP when it is going to compile it will take the new name and then world name is changed to the new name which is given it say the program and then we open a curly bracket class must have at least one method here we are going to learn a standard method called main method in the beginning of the learning just we can follow the course as given and then later we will come to know what are the words what are the keywords which is used for which purpose so now we are having a method for main method with public static void main of string of arguments so here we have keywords called public static void main so here mean is the name of the method and all these are keywords Java is casesensitive so the keywords to be returned very carefully with that same spelling whether it is a perky our lawyer case so here the public static void all these three are with only lower cases in the string only yes is capital and then ours that is arguments all are with small arrests so you need with that we right we must have a block of quartz which is open with the curly bracket and then we are going to write the codes their actions there so we are going to just print one line so we are going to write a printing statement system dot out dot print line off then we terminate the action or a single statement which is to be terminated with the semicolon so this is going to create a new line so print lines are print we can give print line means after the output it is going to create a new line this is a empty statement when nothing is written to print so whatever to printer to be given inside the quotation we give here inside the quotation video hello welcome to Java and then we close the method here and then we close the class so this is going to be a first program let us compare this there is no syntax error so we close this window and then right click on this we run the method can't avoid me so there is no argument just click on ok so we get hello welcome to Java in the same program I would also like to tell you about print and print line the difference between print and print line so if we create one more line are print one more line here this was how I printed your line so when we don't give print line here in the first statement the output is going to be in the same line it is not going to be in a fresh line for the next statement this is the difference compiled no syntax error and close this rightclick wide me so you can see hello welcome to Java this was how printer deadlines I hope you learnt the first program how it is created an executor Thank You students keep watching my
