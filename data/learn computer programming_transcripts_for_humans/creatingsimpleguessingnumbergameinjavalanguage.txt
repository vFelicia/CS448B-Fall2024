00:02 - hello students creating game is
00:05 - interesting that too when ourself we
00:08 - write computer coding to create a game
00:10 - will be more interesting isn't it now as
00:13 - a learning process we will create a Java
00:16 - game program which is called guessing
00:18 - number let me explain this game first
00:22 - computer generates a number within a
00:25 - range player should guess the number so
00:29 - the range may be given by the programmer
00:33 - it can be said as we need if the number
00:38 - guessed by player is not correct then it
00:40 - gives a clue the clue will be whether
00:43 - the number guessed is smaller are
00:45 - greater than the number it has with this
00:48 - clue again player should guess the
00:50 - number
00:51 - this gets continued until the guest
00:54 - number is correct
00:56 - finally it rates you with stars to take
00:59 - the input we will import the scanner
01:02 - class import Java dot util dot scanner
01:10 - class card
01:11 - guessing you I have written the main
01:27 - method here now I generate a random
01:32 - number using math class so just I I
01:35 - declare and assign the value in it so I
01:39 - say int R is equal to a random number
01:44 - will give the double number so I will
01:47 - make it into int so I give explicit here
01:50 - int then math dot random off so this
01:56 - will create a random number between 1
02:00 - and 0 if we need in between 0 and 10
02:06 - what I am going to do is I am going to
02:08 - multiply this with 10 into 10
02:12 - then plus one I terminate this now I
02:17 - create a object for scanner class
02:20 - scanner SC is equal to new scanner half
02:25 - system dotty
02:29 - now I prompt the user to view the number
02:33 - so I will write system dot out dot print
02:37 - off enter a positive number below 10 now
02:50 - I will assign it int n is equal to yes a
02:53 - dot next in tough if I want to give the
03:00 - ratings I need to count how many chances
03:02 - the user used for that I will create a
03:06 - counter variable that is int C so in the
03:11 - beginning it will be one here we need a
03:15 - loop because we don't know how many
03:17 - times the user will take so when number
03:21 - of iterations are not known we will be
03:23 - using while loop so I use while the
03:30 - number guessed by user is n is not equal
03:35 - to R which is the computer number then
03:40 - what it will do chance is counter here
03:44 - so C++ if the number given by the user
03:48 - is smaller so that is if n is smaller
03:54 - than R then what we say system dot out
04:02 - dot print line off that is young given
04:09 - whether user plus is smaller I say yes
04:19 - it will be greater so i copy this and
04:23 - paste it here and write it here as
04:26 - greater now I will be asking to enter
04:32 - another number so let me just change
04:36 - this enter another number
04:57 - no oven I store it in the variable
05:00 - called n is equal to yes C dot next in
05:08 - tough now this course keep getting
05:13 - executed until the guest number is
05:16 - number generated by the computer now we
05:19 - know how many chances the user has been
05:22 - taken so we will code according to that
05:25 - the ratings if the first chance itself
05:29 - it is right then we will give Phi star
05:32 - to the player if the second chance is
05:36 - right then we will you three stars
05:38 - if third chance is taken and then one
05:41 - single star otherwise more than that it
05:43 - is been taken just we say you win so let
05:46 - us write the code for that so that will
05:49 - be outside the loop if C is equal to
05:57 - equal to one then what we say system dot
06:01 - out dot print line enough we will give
06:05 - five stars here one two three four five
06:08 - backslash n gives the new line and then
06:11 - say congratulations
06:19 - so let us copy this and paste in case if
06:24 - it is two counts else if this to count
06:30 - and then we will give three star
06:41 - if it is three-count then we will you
06:47 - one single star
06:55 - so here is elsif yes we will you you win
07:11 - let us compile there is no syntax error
07:16 - let us run this game so let me enter a
07:19 - number I enter 6 so first guess itself
07:24 - it is right congratulations
07:26 - it came with 5 stars so let me play once
07:29 - again so now I you for 4 is smaller so
07:33 - the number should be greater than 4 I
07:36 - guess with 8 8 is greater so it should
07:41 - be 5 6 7
07:42 - let me guess 7 congratulations so the
07:47 - third guess it was right so it says one
07:50 - single star and congratulations students
07:55 - I hope that you might have enjoyed this
07:58 - program keep watching my channel keep
08:00 - learning thank you
