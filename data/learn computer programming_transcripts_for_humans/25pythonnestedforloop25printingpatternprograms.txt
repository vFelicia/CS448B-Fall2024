00:01 - hello everyone welcome back we are in
00:03 - the process of learning for loop from
00:06 - last few sessions
00:08 - today also we are going to continue with
00:10 - the
00:10 - nested for loop
00:13 - in this class we are going to learn
00:16 - how to create the pattern programs
00:19 - using nested for loop nearly 25 programs
00:22 - are there i will be explaining most of
00:24 - them i have also given the source code
00:27 - in the description you can click on the
00:29 - link and get the code for all the
00:30 - pattern programs as pdf file before
00:33 - going into program just i wanted to tell
00:35 - you one thing if you don't know how the
00:38 - nested for loop works please go to my
00:40 - previous video learn and come back here
00:42 - so that it will be very clear for you to
00:44 - understand further let me go to the
00:46 - script more
00:50 - now let us consider a very basic shape
00:52 - using star
00:54 - just i wanted to print maybe a
00:56 - rectangular one
00:59 - so this is the shape which is
01:00 - rectangular shape having five stars in
01:03 - the
01:04 - each row like that there are three rows
01:08 - i give for i in range
01:11 - so first let us consider one single row
01:14 - there are five stars right so i in range
01:17 - if i give five
01:20 - right it will be printing five times if
01:22 - i give print statement here
01:24 - print
01:25 - i just wanted to print star so i give
01:28 - star and then if i want to print in the
01:31 - same line i will be giving n equal to
01:35 - that is open and close yet nothing
01:37 - inside i give so it will be just simply
01:39 - printing only one
01:41 - row with five stars let us check this
01:45 - so it prints like that in case i need
01:48 - this to repeat this three times in rows
01:51 - what i can do before this
01:55 - i can give a for loop
01:58 - and then three times iq see just a small
02:02 - change i make i make this as i
02:05 - and then this
02:06 - j
02:08 - now this second for loop will be inside
02:11 - the previous for loop so one indent i
02:14 - have given for this see now three times
02:17 - it will be working first time it takes
02:20 - 0
02:21 - in the range and then here this will
02:24 - take 5 times it will be running so 5
02:27 - times the star is being printed right
02:30 - after this i want to come to the new
02:33 - line for that purpose what i shall do
02:36 - i can come
02:37 - to the new line
02:39 - after executing this so not every time
02:42 - after executing this
02:44 - after completion of all 5 stars so that
02:47 - is outside this for loop so i will be
02:49 - giving here
02:50 - print and then one simply
02:54 - open and close bracket that means just
02:56 - it prints a new line
02:58 - i will tell you one hint
03:00 - this
03:01 - three that is responsible for rows so
03:04 - anytime you are giving the outer loop
03:06 - number of rows it will be in the inner
03:09 - loop here it will be number of columns
03:11 - see one two three four five so five
03:14 - stars are there five columns so every
03:17 - row five columns it pre
03:20 - so
03:20 - prints
03:22 - okay this is the first one let me have
03:25 - user defined number of rows and column
03:28 - so for that purpose what i can do
03:30 - instead of this 3 and 5 giving us a
03:33 - constant i will be taking from the user
03:37 - saying for rows i said r and then i say
03:41 - integer of input
03:47 - enter the number of rows
03:53 - similar way
03:54 - for columns
03:56 - i suppose to close one more bracket
04:00 - for columns number of column circuit
04:05 - after this i will be changing this s row
04:07 - as i said this is for row and this is
04:10 - for column right c i give and then this
04:13 - i give here
04:14 - a c let me run this
04:18 - i need five rows with
04:20 - seven stars
04:23 - you can see
04:25 - the same is being printed
04:28 - hope this is clear so the second one is
04:31 - modified one with number of rows and
04:33 - columns input by the user
04:37 - now instead of this pattern
04:39 - i need
04:40 - maybe like this let us take away this i
04:43 - in range
04:45 - so 3 rows are there i put 3 here or else
04:48 - we can also take 1 comma 4 here j is
04:50 - there that is number of columns
04:53 - 1 to 5. so it starts from 1 i will be
04:56 - giving 1 and then it should stop at
04:59 - 5 means i should be giving 6 here see
05:02 - every time that is every column the
05:05 - number keeps changing right that is
05:07 - responsible for column so instead of
05:11 - star
05:12 - i will be giving here j
05:14 - so it increases it prints j
05:17 - remember we don't need to give inside
05:18 - the quotation
05:20 - if it is a quotation it will be printing
05:22 - only j so here it is a number i just
05:24 - give us
05:25 - j there if i need a space between the
05:28 - numbers i can give one
05:30 - space here let me run this
05:34 - it has printed exactly whatever we need
05:37 - now instead of this one two three four
05:40 - five each row with the same number that
05:42 - is first one is as one one one second is
05:45 - as two two two three three three
05:47 - what i supposed to do so remember here
05:50 - i is
05:51 - meant for the rows as the number of rows
05:54 - changes the same count also is being
05:57 - printed first row one second row two
06:00 - third row three so it is not going to
06:02 - change every time j runs five times
06:04 - similarly five times it is being printed
06:06 - small changes we are making here instead
06:08 - of j we make i that's all nothing else
06:14 - you can see
06:15 - now let us consider
06:17 - this pattern
06:18 - see here the first row is having one
06:21 - element second row is having two
06:22 - elements and then so on and also we can
06:25 - notice that
06:26 - every time
06:27 - the column increases its value how it
06:30 - can happen first row with one column
06:32 - second row with two column third row
06:34 - with three column that means number of
06:36 - columns is equal to number of rows how
06:38 - many rows are there totally there are
06:40 - five rows so we can consider as it is
06:42 - starting from one and then ends with
06:45 - five we can give here 6 so it becomes 1
06:48 - to 6 for
06:50 - i that is our number of rows now what we
06:53 - need to print
06:55 - if we print 1 to 6 every time it is
06:57 - going to print 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
07:01 - instead of that as i told number of
07:04 - columns equal to number of rows we will
07:07 - connect i to j when
07:10 - i is 1
07:11 - this let it be i itself but i means it
07:15 - will stop on that number so we will just
07:17 - give plus one so that if i is one
07:20 - here it will be
07:22 - one comma two
07:24 - so one time it will be printing so like
07:26 - that if it increases when it is two
07:30 - this becomes 1 comma 3 so 1 and 2 it
07:33 - will be printing the next count when it
07:35 - is 3
07:36 - this becomes 1 to 4 so
07:40 - this will be printed now when it is
07:43 - 4
07:44 - this will be 1 to 5 that is
07:48 - this row will be printed and then
07:51 - similar way the last rows day is only
07:53 - being printed as every time number
07:55 - changes in the column i am running this
07:59 - you can see perfectly done let us
08:02 - consider
08:04 - this pattern
08:05 - see here 1 and then here 2 1 last time
08:08 - it was 1 2
08:09 - 1 2 3 like that it is going in reverse
08:12 - every time right for this what we
08:14 - supposed to do the row count is same let
08:17 - it be
08:18 - but when it is
08:20 - 2 for the next one
08:22 - we can give i here
08:24 - so that when i becomes 2 this becomes 2
08:28 - so where it should end
08:30 - it will be ending by
08:32 - 0
08:33 - 0 means before this at 1 it will be
08:36 - stopping
08:37 - when it is going in reverse remember by
08:40 - default
08:41 - it is plus 1 if it is minus 1 we
08:43 - supposed to give here so minus 1
08:47 - again
08:48 - j that means changing every time
08:51 - when it prints a column correct let us
08:54 - run this
08:56 - you can see perfectly this also done
09:01 - now
09:02 - i need a pattern like this see the shape
09:04 - is same the increment is same but
09:06 - instead of changing every time in the
09:08 - column it remains as it is that means
09:11 - when
09:12 - first row it is 1 the second row all the
09:15 - numbers are 2 so that means nothing but
09:18 - i so let me just change this to i
09:21 - that's all no more changes
09:25 - perfect now let me consider the other
09:27 - way at the beginning 5 the next row is
09:31 - 4 5
09:32 - 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 1 2 three four five every
09:36 - time
09:37 - the first number of row keeps decreasing
09:40 - so it starts from five i give five
09:44 - and then where it stops at zero
09:47 - that is
09:49 - before that one it will be stopping that
09:51 - is this one
09:53 - now when it is going in reverse
09:56 - minus one i supposed to give
09:58 - as a step
09:59 - now j loop
10:01 - you can notice that
10:03 - every end
10:05 - element is
10:06 - 5
10:08 - so it should be ending at 6
10:11 - that is confirmed
10:13 - now
10:14 - the beginning always
10:16 - one lesser than the previous one lesser
10:18 - than the previous where it starts it
10:21 - starts at five now
10:23 - five to six that is only one
10:27 - what i can do here to make
10:30 - next time to
10:31 - lesson 1 i will create one variable
10:34 - k is equal to 0 in the beginning
10:37 - and then here i will give just minus k
10:41 - so now next time what happens the k will
10:44 - be
10:45 - increasing by 1
10:48 - so what i will give k
10:51 - plus equal to
10:52 - 1
10:53 - so every time k increases it is
10:56 - subtracted from 5
10:59 - it will reach up to
11:01 - 1
11:02 - as this goes 5
11:04 - while printing
11:06 - every time the
11:09 - column changes the value so that means i
11:11 - will be printing here j
11:14 - let us check this
11:18 - so it is again perfect
11:22 - now i have a
11:23 - pattern
11:24 - 1
11:25 - 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 see
11:31 - the number does not repeat at all
11:34 - it keeps increasing
11:36 - and the
11:38 - pattern is same what i can do for this
11:41 - the pattern
11:43 - we can use any way here let us have the
11:46 - beginning
11:47 - how we did
11:49 - it was one comma six and then here let
11:52 - it be as one comma i plus one this will
11:55 - create a pattern like right angle
11:57 - triangle the shape
11:59 - but here when we need to print the
12:01 - continuous number i start this k as 1
12:05 - and then i will be printing k here
12:09 - i keep increasing k
12:11 - every time but not in the outer for loop
12:15 - it is inside the inner form so that
12:17 - every time it gets increases
12:20 - it doesn't have any control on
12:22 - this
12:23 - irj loop continuously it keeps
12:26 - increasing let me check this
12:29 - you can see it is perfect again
12:33 - in case
12:34 - number of rows you need as per user's
12:37 - choice we can just simply add n is equal
12:41 - to
12:42 - into
12:44 - input of
12:45 - enter
12:46 - number of rows you need
12:50 - now what i will do instead of this 6 i
12:53 - will give n plus 1
12:56 - let us try this
12:58 - let me expand this
13:02 - i could see 25 lines here
13:07 - this time i have a pattern with alphabet
13:10 - a a b abc abcd i will take help of
13:14 - ascii values we know capital a's ascii
13:18 - value is 65 and then it increases so on
13:21 - so what i will be giving here i will
13:23 - increase this from 65
13:26 - up to 70 so that is 5 times here
13:31 - it starts from 65
13:33 - then i plus 1
13:36 - when i print
13:38 - instead of printing this number
13:41 - i am going to change it ascii value to
13:44 - character so ch r of j i will print so
13:49 - every time the column keep changing i
13:52 - don't need this k here now
13:54 - for time being
13:56 - let us check this
14:01 - it is right if i need number of rows
14:03 - given by use a similar thing n is equal
14:06 - to into
14:08 - input of
14:10 - enter number of
14:12 - rows so here what i am going to do it
14:16 - starts from 65
14:18 - so
14:19 - i add 65
14:21 - plus n
14:22 - the 65 itself is included so plus that
14:26 - many times it comes let us check
14:30 - so for example i need 15 rows
14:35 - you can see that 15 rows it has been
14:37 - printed
14:41 - now if i need a repeated values in each
14:44 - row
14:45 - it is very simple
14:47 - i just print i instead of j
14:50 - so every row the same
14:53 - alphabet is being printed
14:55 - let us check this
14:58 - 7
15:00 - you can see that it is being printed
15:03 - if i need a pattern with alphabet
15:06 - continuously
15:09 - here smaller alphabets are there i will
15:12 - take
15:14 - n s 97 as ascii value of
15:18 - lowercase a is 97
15:21 - let this be as normal
15:23 - 1 comma 6
15:26 - and then
15:29 - 1 comma
15:30 - i plus 1
15:32 - what i am going to print is
15:34 - character of n
15:36 - i need to increase n's value every time
15:40 - so
15:41 - n
15:42 - plus equal to 1
15:46 - let me check this
15:50 - it is right
15:52 - now let us consider the pattern which is
15:54 - opposite right angle triangle
16:01 - from the greater one it keeps decreasing
16:03 - i will be having here
16:05 - 5
16:06 - up to 0 then right
16:08 - when it keeps decreasing i will be
16:10 - writing minus 1 s step so first time it
16:14 - is 5 next time it is 4
16:16 - so
16:17 - i need to link this i
16:20 - in the beginning of this
16:22 - so that it is
16:24 - i here
16:26 - and then
16:27 - until where it can go
16:29 - it can go up to
16:31 - 0 here also
16:33 - so that it stops at 1 always and then
16:36 - here also minus 1 will be the step
16:39 - what i am going to print
16:41 - i can print just
16:43 - star inside the quotation so it prints
16:46 - this
16:47 - star i don't need this
16:49 - i take away
16:50 - let us check
16:54 - it is right if i need the number type
16:57 - say like this
16:59 - it starts from
17:01 - 5 and ends at 1 so this is right
17:06 - and then every time this
17:08 - i keeps decreasing
17:10 - so this also starts from 4 and the next
17:13 - 3 to 1
17:15 - and this is also same
17:17 - instead of printing the star
17:19 - i am going to print
17:21 - j as every time the column keeps
17:24 - changing
17:25 - let us check this
17:28 - even this is right if i need the
17:30 - repetition of number like this
17:33 - simply i print
17:35 - i instead of j
17:39 - it is so simple
17:42 - this is another type
17:44 - it starts from one and ends with five
17:47 - every time it starts with one but ends
17:49 - with one lesser than the previous one so
17:53 - the outer for loop is right it runs five
17:56 - times but the inner for loop we can
17:58 - change as it starts from 1 i can give 1
18:01 - always it ends which is equal to i so i
18:05 - will be giving i and then plus 1 here
18:10 - it is in increasing order so i can
18:12 - cancel this
18:13 - now i will be printing
18:15 - j as every time the column changes
18:19 - let us check this
18:22 - this is right let me have little bit
18:26 - changed version here
18:30 - see one two three four five two three
18:32 - four five three four five four five and
18:34 - five
18:35 - it ends with five
18:37 - so it starts from
18:39 - one and it goes up to 5
18:43 - so the outer for loop i can write like
18:46 - 1 comma 6
18:49 - i keep increasing every round the same
18:53 - increased number only i need so i give
18:56 - as i
18:57 - and then this will be ending at
19:00 - 6 again
19:01 - every time it ends with 5 here in the
19:04 - pattern that's all j it is printing
19:08 - let us check this
19:10 - this is also right
19:12 - if i need using alphabet like this
19:16 - we know it starts from 65 i will be
19:19 - giving 65
19:21 - and then it will be ending with 70
19:25 - e is 69 here i2 again 70 i will be
19:29 - giving then
19:30 - character of j
19:33 - let us check this
19:37 - this is also
19:38 - perfect if i need that in other way
19:43 - say like this
19:47 - it starts at e that is 69
19:52 - and then will be ending at
19:55 - a that is 65 so i should be giving here
19:58 - 64.
20:00 - this is going in reverse order i give
20:02 - minus 1 now 69 next round will be 68 so
20:06 - the same thing only we need let it be as
20:09 - i only so ending will be here
20:12 - as
20:14 - 64. you can see every time it ends with
20:17 - ea
20:18 - this is in reverse order so i should
20:20 - again give here minus let us check this
20:26 - yeah this is also right
20:28 - if i need the repetition of letter e d
20:33 - c like that like this what shall i do
20:37 - i just print
20:38 - i there let me check
20:42 - yes this is also right
20:45 - so far we have seen so many right angle
20:48 - triangle using the nested for loop you
20:50 - might have got good hold of nested for
20:53 - loop by now practice is more important
20:56 - than you just listen the class so keep
20:58 - practicing
21:08 - most of this i have explained you
21:10 - there are nearly 25 programs
21:13 - pdf of this is given in the description
21:17 - when you click the link you will be
21:19 - getting it
21:20 - these two programs
21:23 - are using the string functions that i
21:26 - will
21:26 - let you know once we complete learning
21:28 - the string functions so keep watching
21:31 - this channel keep learning
21:33 - let us meet in the next class with sum
21:35 - of series program until then bye thank
21:38 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back we are in the process of learning for loop from last few sessions today also we are going to continue with the nested for loop in this class we are going to learn how to create the pattern programs using nested for loop nearly 25 programs are there i will be explaining most of them i have also given the source code in the description you can click on the link and get the code for all the pattern programs as pdf file before going into program just i wanted to tell you one thing if you don't know how the nested for loop works please go to my previous video learn and come back here so that it will be very clear for you to understand further let me go to the script more now let us consider a very basic shape using star just i wanted to print maybe a rectangular one so this is the shape which is rectangular shape having five stars in the each row like that there are three rows i give for i in range so first let us consider one single row there are five stars right so i in range if i give five right it will be printing five times if i give print statement here print i just wanted to print star so i give star and then if i want to print in the same line i will be giving n equal to that is open and close yet nothing inside i give so it will be just simply printing only one row with five stars let us check this so it prints like that in case i need this to repeat this three times in rows what i can do before this i can give a for loop and then three times iq see just a small change i make i make this as i and then this j now this second for loop will be inside the previous for loop so one indent i have given for this see now three times it will be working first time it takes 0 in the range and then here this will take 5 times it will be running so 5 times the star is being printed right after this i want to come to the new line for that purpose what i shall do i can come to the new line after executing this so not every time after executing this after completion of all 5 stars so that is outside this for loop so i will be giving here print and then one simply open and close bracket that means just it prints a new line i will tell you one hint this three that is responsible for rows so anytime you are giving the outer loop number of rows it will be in the inner loop here it will be number of columns see one two three four five so five stars are there five columns so every row five columns it pre so prints okay this is the first one let me have user defined number of rows and column so for that purpose what i can do instead of this 3 and 5 giving us a constant i will be taking from the user saying for rows i said r and then i say integer of input enter the number of rows similar way for columns i suppose to close one more bracket for columns number of column circuit after this i will be changing this s row as i said this is for row and this is for column right c i give and then this i give here a c let me run this i need five rows with seven stars you can see the same is being printed hope this is clear so the second one is modified one with number of rows and columns input by the user now instead of this pattern i need maybe like this let us take away this i in range so 3 rows are there i put 3 here or else we can also take 1 comma 4 here j is there that is number of columns 1 to 5. so it starts from 1 i will be giving 1 and then it should stop at 5 means i should be giving 6 here see every time that is every column the number keeps changing right that is responsible for column so instead of star i will be giving here j so it increases it prints j remember we don't need to give inside the quotation if it is a quotation it will be printing only j so here it is a number i just give us j there if i need a space between the numbers i can give one space here let me run this it has printed exactly whatever we need now instead of this one two three four five each row with the same number that is first one is as one one one second is as two two two three three three what i supposed to do so remember here i is meant for the rows as the number of rows changes the same count also is being printed first row one second row two third row three so it is not going to change every time j runs five times similarly five times it is being printed small changes we are making here instead of j we make i that's all nothing else you can see now let us consider this pattern see here the first row is having one element second row is having two elements and then so on and also we can notice that every time the column increases its value how it can happen first row with one column second row with two column third row with three column that means number of columns is equal to number of rows how many rows are there totally there are five rows so we can consider as it is starting from one and then ends with five we can give here 6 so it becomes 1 to 6 for i that is our number of rows now what we need to print if we print 1 to 6 every time it is going to print 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 instead of that as i told number of columns equal to number of rows we will connect i to j when i is 1 this let it be i itself but i means it will stop on that number so we will just give plus one so that if i is one here it will be one comma two so one time it will be printing so like that if it increases when it is two this becomes 1 comma 3 so 1 and 2 it will be printing the next count when it is 3 this becomes 1 to 4 so this will be printed now when it is 4 this will be 1 to 5 that is this row will be printed and then similar way the last rows day is only being printed as every time number changes in the column i am running this you can see perfectly done let us consider this pattern see here 1 and then here 2 1 last time it was 1 2 1 2 3 like that it is going in reverse every time right for this what we supposed to do the row count is same let it be but when it is 2 for the next one we can give i here so that when i becomes 2 this becomes 2 so where it should end it will be ending by 0 0 means before this at 1 it will be stopping when it is going in reverse remember by default it is plus 1 if it is minus 1 we supposed to give here so minus 1 again j that means changing every time when it prints a column correct let us run this you can see perfectly this also done now i need a pattern like this see the shape is same the increment is same but instead of changing every time in the column it remains as it is that means when first row it is 1 the second row all the numbers are 2 so that means nothing but i so let me just change this to i that's all no more changes perfect now let me consider the other way at the beginning 5 the next row is 4 5 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 1 2 three four five every time the first number of row keeps decreasing so it starts from five i give five and then where it stops at zero that is before that one it will be stopping that is this one now when it is going in reverse minus one i supposed to give as a step now j loop you can notice that every end element is 5 so it should be ending at 6 that is confirmed now the beginning always one lesser than the previous one lesser than the previous where it starts it starts at five now five to six that is only one what i can do here to make next time to lesson 1 i will create one variable k is equal to 0 in the beginning and then here i will give just minus k so now next time what happens the k will be increasing by 1 so what i will give k plus equal to 1 so every time k increases it is subtracted from 5 it will reach up to 1 as this goes 5 while printing every time the column changes the value so that means i will be printing here j let us check this so it is again perfect now i have a pattern 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 see the number does not repeat at all it keeps increasing and the pattern is same what i can do for this the pattern we can use any way here let us have the beginning how we did it was one comma six and then here let it be as one comma i plus one this will create a pattern like right angle triangle the shape but here when we need to print the continuous number i start this k as 1 and then i will be printing k here i keep increasing k every time but not in the outer for loop it is inside the inner form so that every time it gets increases it doesn't have any control on this irj loop continuously it keeps increasing let me check this you can see it is perfect again in case number of rows you need as per user's choice we can just simply add n is equal to into input of enter number of rows you need now what i will do instead of this 6 i will give n plus 1 let us try this let me expand this i could see 25 lines here this time i have a pattern with alphabet a a b abc abcd i will take help of ascii values we know capital a's ascii value is 65 and then it increases so on so what i will be giving here i will increase this from 65 up to 70 so that is 5 times here it starts from 65 then i plus 1 when i print instead of printing this number i am going to change it ascii value to character so ch r of j i will print so every time the column keep changing i don't need this k here now for time being let us check this it is right if i need number of rows given by use a similar thing n is equal to into input of enter number of rows so here what i am going to do it starts from 65 so i add 65 plus n the 65 itself is included so plus that many times it comes let us check so for example i need 15 rows you can see that 15 rows it has been printed now if i need a repeated values in each row it is very simple i just print i instead of j so every row the same alphabet is being printed let us check this 7 you can see that it is being printed if i need a pattern with alphabet continuously here smaller alphabets are there i will take n s 97 as ascii value of lowercase a is 97 let this be as normal 1 comma 6 and then 1 comma i plus 1 what i am going to print is character of n i need to increase n's value every time so n plus equal to 1 let me check this it is right now let us consider the pattern which is opposite right angle triangle from the greater one it keeps decreasing i will be having here 5 up to 0 then right when it keeps decreasing i will be writing minus 1 s step so first time it is 5 next time it is 4 so i need to link this i in the beginning of this so that it is i here and then until where it can go it can go up to 0 here also so that it stops at 1 always and then here also minus 1 will be the step what i am going to print i can print just star inside the quotation so it prints this star i don't need this i take away let us check it is right if i need the number type say like this it starts from 5 and ends at 1 so this is right and then every time this i keeps decreasing so this also starts from 4 and the next 3 to 1 and this is also same instead of printing the star i am going to print j as every time the column keeps changing let us check this even this is right if i need the repetition of number like this simply i print i instead of j it is so simple this is another type it starts from one and ends with five every time it starts with one but ends with one lesser than the previous one so the outer for loop is right it runs five times but the inner for loop we can change as it starts from 1 i can give 1 always it ends which is equal to i so i will be giving i and then plus 1 here it is in increasing order so i can cancel this now i will be printing j as every time the column changes let us check this this is right let me have little bit changed version here see one two three four five two three four five three four five four five and five it ends with five so it starts from one and it goes up to 5 so the outer for loop i can write like 1 comma 6 i keep increasing every round the same increased number only i need so i give as i and then this will be ending at 6 again every time it ends with 5 here in the pattern that's all j it is printing let us check this this is also right if i need using alphabet like this we know it starts from 65 i will be giving 65 and then it will be ending with 70 e is 69 here i2 again 70 i will be giving then character of j let us check this this is also perfect if i need that in other way say like this it starts at e that is 69 and then will be ending at a that is 65 so i should be giving here 64. this is going in reverse order i give minus 1 now 69 next round will be 68 so the same thing only we need let it be as i only so ending will be here as 64. you can see every time it ends with ea this is in reverse order so i should again give here minus let us check this yeah this is also right if i need the repetition of letter e d c like that like this what shall i do i just print i there let me check yes this is also right so far we have seen so many right angle triangle using the nested for loop you might have got good hold of nested for loop by now practice is more important than you just listen the class so keep practicing most of this i have explained you there are nearly 25 programs pdf of this is given in the description when you click the link you will be getting it these two programs are using the string functions that i will let you know once we complete learning the string functions so keep watching this channel keep learning let us meet in the next class with sum of series program until then bye thank you
