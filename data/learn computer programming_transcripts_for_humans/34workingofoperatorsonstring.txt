00:08 - foreign
00:16 - welcome back
00:18 - do you know even The Operators works on
00:21 - strings
00:23 - here we will discuss which are all the
00:25 - operators works on string concatenation
00:28 - we use addition symbol for that
00:32 - repetition multiplication relational
00:35 - operator also works on the string
00:39 - membership operator in and not in
00:43 - and then identity operator is and is not
00:46 - also works on the string even we have
00:49 - slicing in the string
00:52 - in this class except slicing we will see
00:55 - all other operators how it works on the
00:58 - string
00:59 - I will demonstrate everything directly
01:01 - on the python window let us open python
01:04 - window
01:06 - I initiate ST1 as word there
01:11 - and then st2
01:13 - as power
01:16 - now arithmetic operator Plus
01:19 - I will give ST1 plus s t 2 that means it
01:24 - will concatenate both the word and
01:26 - display together
01:31 - note there is no space in between the
01:34 - words
01:35 - just it will display nearby now let me
01:39 - have ST1 multiplied by 3. so this will
01:43 - replicate
01:45 - word three times
01:47 - in membership operator you will check
01:49 - whether the substring is available in
01:51 - the
01:52 - string and then if it is available it
01:55 - will return true otherwise it will
01:57 - return false
02:00 - so now I am giving here enter
02:03 - in
02:08 - International so enter is available
02:11 - there so it will be returning
02:13 - prove here
02:15 - now I am giving
02:17 - word
02:18 - in
02:22 - International
02:23 - so it is not available it will be giving
02:25 - false
02:27 - we will also check not in
02:30 - enter
02:32 - not in international
02:35 - see it is available it should be saying
02:38 - now false
02:41 - now let us check power
02:49 - not in
02:54 - National so it is not there it will say
02:57 - true
02:59 - I have S1 is equal to
03:02 - Windows here
03:06 - then es2 as
03:08 - let me give paper
03:13 - now I can check with this relational
03:15 - operator
03:17 - when S1 is equal to IQ
03:20 - S2
03:22 - it is false as both the ASCII value of
03:25 - the starting letter is different
03:29 - so it is false now if I give S one is
03:33 - greater than S2
03:36 - see here S2 starts with p so it's ASCII
03:40 - values lesser than W's so this will be
03:44 - true
03:45 - now let me give win
03:48 - is greater than S1
03:52 - see here
03:54 - win is the starting part of S1 that is
03:57 - Windows rate
03:59 - but Windows has more than the swin
04:04 - so win cannot be greater than S1 so this
04:07 - will be false
04:11 - now I have here windmill
04:17 - is
04:18 - greater than Windows that is S1 I will
04:21 - you
04:23 - here w i n d is common in both the next
04:27 - letter it will be checking so War has
04:30 - more ASCII value than m
04:33 - so S1 is having greater value here
04:38 - than windmills m
04:40 - so this will be false
04:42 - now let me have
04:46 - paper is equal to
04:50 - S2 see S2 is also paper
04:54 - so both are having the same spelling
04:56 - it is true
04:59 - similar way it works with greater than
05:02 - or equal to and lesser than or equal to
05:04 - let us have some example for that
05:09 - laptop is greater than or equal to
05:15 - lap so this will be true as laptop is
05:19 - having more characters than the slab
05:22 - which is the starting of laptop
05:26 - now let me give learn
05:31 - is greater than
05:34 - computer
05:37 - see here L is having greater ASCII value
05:41 - than the C
05:44 - let me give greater than or equal to
05:48 - so this will be true
05:55 - now I give programming is lesser than or
05:59 - equal to
06:00 - online
06:03 - please ASCII value is 1 greater than o
06:06 - so this will be false
06:09 - now I give YouTube
06:12 - is not equal to
06:15 - you
06:18 - it is true
06:20 - now e is and E is not that is identity
06:24 - operator
06:25 - now let me check
06:27 - U
06:29 - is u
06:32 - this will be true
06:36 - similar way
06:38 - YouTube
06:41 - is not
06:43 - YouTube see there
06:46 - here this will be
06:48 - true as capital Y and small y are
06:52 - different
06:53 - so these are not same
06:55 - right so ID of this also will be
06:57 - different so this will be true
07:00 - now let me give paper
07:05 - is S2
07:08 - see S2 is paper so this should be true
07:13 - hope this was very simple to understand
07:15 - keep watching this channel keep learning
07:18 - keep practicing
07:21 - thank you

foreign welcome back do you know even The Operators works on strings here we will discuss which are all the operators works on string concatenation we use addition symbol for that repetition multiplication relational operator also works on the string membership operator in and not in and then identity operator is and is not also works on the string even we have slicing in the string in this class except slicing we will see all other operators how it works on the string I will demonstrate everything directly on the python window let us open python window I initiate ST1 as word there and then st2 as power now arithmetic operator Plus I will give ST1 plus s t 2 that means it will concatenate both the word and display together note there is no space in between the words just it will display nearby now let me have ST1 multiplied by 3. so this will replicate word three times in membership operator you will check whether the substring is available in the string and then if it is available it will return true otherwise it will return false so now I am giving here enter in International so enter is available there so it will be returning prove here now I am giving word in International so it is not available it will be giving false we will also check not in enter not in international see it is available it should be saying now false now let us check power not in National so it is not there it will say true I have S1 is equal to Windows here then es2 as let me give paper now I can check with this relational operator when S1 is equal to IQ S2 it is false as both the ASCII value of the starting letter is different so it is false now if I give S one is greater than S2 see here S2 starts with p so it's ASCII values lesser than W's so this will be true now let me give win is greater than S1 see here win is the starting part of S1 that is Windows rate but Windows has more than the swin so win cannot be greater than S1 so this will be false now I have here windmill is greater than Windows that is S1 I will you here w i n d is common in both the next letter it will be checking so War has more ASCII value than m so S1 is having greater value here than windmills m so this will be false now let me have paper is equal to S2 see S2 is also paper so both are having the same spelling it is true similar way it works with greater than or equal to and lesser than or equal to let us have some example for that laptop is greater than or equal to lap so this will be true as laptop is having more characters than the slab which is the starting of laptop now let me give learn is greater than computer see here L is having greater ASCII value than the C let me give greater than or equal to so this will be true now I give programming is lesser than or equal to online please ASCII value is 1 greater than o so this will be false now I give YouTube is not equal to you it is true now e is and E is not that is identity operator now let me check U is u this will be true similar way YouTube is not YouTube see there here this will be true as capital Y and small y are different so these are not same right so ID of this also will be different so this will be true now let me give paper is S2 see S2 is paper so this should be true hope this was very simple to understand keep watching this channel keep learning keep practicing thank you
