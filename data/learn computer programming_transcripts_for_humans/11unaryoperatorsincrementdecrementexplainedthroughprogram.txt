00:00 - welcome back students today we are going
00:03 - to see unity operators before seeing
00:08 - unary operators let me explain what is
00:13 - operator let us have an example five
00:17 - plus six here we have two values five
00:22 - and six which is being operated by the
00:25 - symbol which is plus here the plus
00:28 - symbol is called an operator then five
00:31 - and six this both are operands so the
00:37 - operator operates two operands then it
00:42 - is binary operator okay so that is plus
00:47 - is a binary operator in this case same
00:51 - like this - division and multiplication
00:55 - also can be binary operators if it is a
01:03 - unary operator then it will operate only
01:06 - one operand
01:08 - how let us see with an example program
01:27 - [Applause]
01:34 - class unity public static void main
01:42 - string of our Nets
01:48 - let us have two variables here int X
01:54 - comma Y so I am initially Singh wise
01:59 - value as serving the
02:07 - X X is equal to Y so the wise value is
02:14 - going to be stored in the variable
02:17 - called yes let us print this well yeah
02:37 - yes photo plus yes so instead of Y I
02:47 - just u plus y so which is a unary
02:51 - operator here so will there be any
02:54 - change
02:54 - no there won't be any change because if
02:58 - plus operator proceeds the value does
03:02 - not change compile this
03:09 - so the value of X is 7 let us have minus
03:16 - instead of plus so the unary minus so
03:21 - which is going to change the value if -
03:27 - precedes an operand operator inverts the
03:31 - value of n of tangle like 7 is there for
03:36 - y then minus 7 means ultimately it
03:39 - becomes minus 7 so x value is going to
03:42 - be minus 7 let us see here
03:51 - so you can see the axis minus seven the
03:58 - next we have increment operator and
04:01 - decrement operator let us see the
04:05 - increment operator so increment operator
04:08 - is given by plus plus symbol I mean we
04:11 - have two subtype of it that is plus plus
04:15 - y are y plus plus what is the difference
04:21 - between these two the plus plus y is
04:26 - called pre increment so that means
04:30 - before evaluating the expression the
04:35 - values incremented and then it is
04:38 - evaluated in case if it is y plus plus
04:47 - first the value is substituted to that
04:52 - variable
04:52 - and then after evaluating then only the
04:56 - value increases let us have first plus
05:01 - plus and then execute so the value of y
05:05 - is 7 it is pre increment pre means
05:09 - before no so the value of y becomes 8
05:13 - and then it is substituted to X let us
05:18 - print the value of y also here so we
05:21 - will be clearly understanding it here
05:32 - the x value is 8 then wise value also it
05:39 - it incremented before the evaluation of
05:43 - only compile this so you can see X also
05:51 - 8 and the noise is also let us change
05:55 - this to post increment post increment is
05:59 - y plus plus
06:01 - see here the wise value seven the seven
06:05 - values first substituted are stored in X
06:11 - so that is x value is going to be 7
06:14 - after evaluating the expression twice
06:18 - value is going to be changed so that is
06:20 - incremented by 1 that becomes 8 so Y
06:25 - will be 8 when it prints so X is going
06:28 - to be 7 after evaluating Y becomes 8 see
06:41 - the value of x is equal to 7
06:43 - value of y is equal to 8 so this is
06:48 - increment the same like this decrement
06:52 - is also there pre-decrement and
06:55 - post-deployment pre-decrement is - - so
07:00 - what happens if - minus y so as it is
07:03 - free the value of y first going to be 6
07:08 - then it evaluates that means 6 is
07:11 - substituted to X so it is going to be Y
07:16 - X values 6 and then Y is value it
07:24 - remains 6 compile this
07:36 - so let us change this to post decrement
07:39 - so that is y minus minus C post means
07:44 - after evaluating right so the Y is value
07:47 - seven here the seven is substituted in X
07:50 - so there is it is stored in X so the X
07:54 - values seven after evaluating this
07:57 - expression the Y's value is decremented
08:00 - by 1 so that is 6
08:03 - let us compile this so the value of x is
08:12 - 7 when your boy is six students let me
08:20 - again summarize this we have unary
08:24 - operators here that is for unary
08:27 - operators that is plus unary minus unary
08:33 - in plus unity we can't see the changes
08:37 - in - unity we can see the change but it
08:43 - negates the value then increment when we
08:49 - come to increment part there are two
08:52 - types pre increment and post environment
08:55 - pre increment it increases the value and
09:00 - evaluates the expression post increments
09:04 - it evaluates the expression then
09:07 - increments same like that we have
09:10 - decrement operator that is - - so pre in
09:16 - pre-decrement it decreases the value
09:20 - then evaluates the expression in case of
09:24 - post decrement it evaluates the value
09:29 - and then decrease the value of the
09:32 - variable students I hope you understood
09:39 - unary operator very well let me explain
09:44 - some example some
09:47 - theoretically for your exams in next
09:52 - video so please watch my videos and if
09:56 - you subscribe this you will have an
09:59 - intimation whenever I upload you will
10:02 - get the intimation so better you
10:04 - subscribe and keep watching Thank You

welcome back students today we are going to see unity operators before seeing unary operators let me explain what is operator let us have an example five plus six here we have two values five and six which is being operated by the symbol which is plus here the plus symbol is called an operator then five and six this both are operands so the operator operates two operands then it is binary operator okay so that is plus is a binary operator in this case same like this division and multiplication also can be binary operators if it is a unary operator then it will operate only one operand how let us see with an example program class unity public static void main string of our Nets let us have two variables here int X comma Y so I am initially Singh wise value as serving the X X is equal to Y so the wise value is going to be stored in the variable called yes let us print this well yeah yes photo plus yes so instead of Y I just u plus y so which is a unary operator here so will there be any change no there won't be any change because if plus operator proceeds the value does not change compile this so the value of X is 7 let us have minus instead of plus so the unary minus so which is going to change the value if precedes an operand operator inverts the value of n of tangle like 7 is there for y then minus 7 means ultimately it becomes minus 7 so x value is going to be minus 7 let us see here so you can see the axis minus seven the next we have increment operator and decrement operator let us see the increment operator so increment operator is given by plus plus symbol I mean we have two subtype of it that is plus plus y are y plus plus what is the difference between these two the plus plus y is called pre increment so that means before evaluating the expression the values incremented and then it is evaluated in case if it is y plus plus first the value is substituted to that variable and then after evaluating then only the value increases let us have first plus plus and then execute so the value of y is 7 it is pre increment pre means before no so the value of y becomes 8 and then it is substituted to X let us print the value of y also here so we will be clearly understanding it here the x value is 8 then wise value also it it incremented before the evaluation of only compile this so you can see X also 8 and the noise is also let us change this to post increment post increment is y plus plus see here the wise value seven the seven values first substituted are stored in X so that is x value is going to be 7 after evaluating the expression twice value is going to be changed so that is incremented by 1 that becomes 8 so Y will be 8 when it prints so X is going to be 7 after evaluating Y becomes 8 see the value of x is equal to 7 value of y is equal to 8 so this is increment the same like this decrement is also there predecrement and postdeployment predecrement is so what happens if minus y so as it is free the value of y first going to be 6 then it evaluates that means 6 is substituted to X so it is going to be Y X values 6 and then Y is value it remains 6 compile this so let us change this to post decrement so that is y minus minus C post means after evaluating right so the Y is value seven here the seven is substituted in X so there is it is stored in X so the X values seven after evaluating this expression the Y's value is decremented by 1 so that is 6 let us compile this so the value of x is 7 when your boy is six students let me again summarize this we have unary operators here that is for unary operators that is plus unary minus unary in plus unity we can't see the changes in unity we can see the change but it negates the value then increment when we come to increment part there are two types pre increment and post environment pre increment it increases the value and evaluates the expression post increments it evaluates the expression then increments same like that we have decrement operator that is so pre in predecrement it decreases the value then evaluates the expression in case of post decrement it evaluates the value and then decrease the value of the variable students I hope you understood unary operator very well let me explain some example some theoretically for your exams in next video so please watch my videos and if you subscribe this you will have an intimation whenever I upload you will get the intimation so better you subscribe and keep watching Thank You strengths
