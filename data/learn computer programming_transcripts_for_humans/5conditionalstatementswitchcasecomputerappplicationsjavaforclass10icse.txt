00:00 - dear students today we are going to see
00:03 - switch case statement this is a multiple
00:07 - branch selection statement this
00:11 - selection statement tests the expression
00:15 - against a list of integer R character
00:19 - constants when the math is found the
00:22 - statements associated with the constant
00:25 - are executed let us see a example
00:28 - program switch case program to take the
00:45 - first letter of the color and print a
01:00 - color according to it to take a input
01:13 - let us import the order to fill the
01:19 - scanner class switch case main method
01:33 - complex pancake point of string of
01:39 - arguments
01:45 - let us declare a character data type to
01:49 - take a character input character see
01:53 - it's our option we hope you can take
01:56 - that make this so let us create an
01:59 - object from the scanner class and obj is
02:04 - equal to new scanner of stem Dalton
02:10 - close this let us intimately use a
02:16 - double pumper printing love you the
02:25 - first rapper dolphin color let us create
02:33 - a method to take input so we assign what
02:37 - P is equal to the object name will be J
02:41 - dot next of dot character character at 0
02:51 - so this will take input of a single
02:54 - character so now water we have taken the
02:57 - input is for the switch case to match
03:01 - the option switch SW o ET CH all in
03:06 - small so you are going to write the
03:09 - option there inside o P then open up
03:12 - bracket so here we are going to write KS
03:17 - as we are going to take a character so
03:21 - we should give inside the single
03:23 - quotation so way for violet and then we
03:29 - have a colon here it is not a semicolon
03:32 - we should be very careful that this is a
03:34 - colon and then write the statement what
03:37 - it is going to say it is going to print
03:40 - violet so system dot out dot print line
03:47 - of say let's print Wireless
03:52 - 0:50 then we have to write break surplus
03:58 - right next case
04:00 - case number holdback
04:10 - clink leg off we go then
04:22 - so let us copy and paste for that and
04:30 - just modify this e I D be in the sense
04:35 - blue blue g g agree then let us again
04:57 - copy this paste why is yellow it is
05:18 - alright so we know this vector so this
05:30 - is power and then
05:36 - set and when it doesn't find any match
05:42 - then the default is been executed what
05:45 - is default where there is no match form
05:48 - so we write x default and then we write
05:53 - maybe wrong input invalid input let us
06:01 - compile and this give the first letter
06:09 - of the process I say I chase integral so
06:14 - now if we give the value which is not
06:17 - matching then it should say invalid so I
06:20 - owe you so it says invalid input so in
06:25 - case of no break there it will not break
06:30 - and then automatically it falls to the
06:33 - next case also and then that code also
06:36 - it X you can let us see I have deleted
06:39 - two breaks from V and I so let us
06:44 - consider this program compare this now
06:50 - while you V as a input so what happens
06:54 - if I do we even violet indigo and blue
06:57 - also comes because there is no break
07:00 - after violet and after indigo so this is
07:03 - called fall through let us see near one
07:12 - more example program which says how many
07:16 - days in a month so for that we just
07:19 - modify this program so program to say
07:24 - the number of days in a month
07:35 - so when we want to take token then we
07:39 - will take the input as integer so we
07:42 - make you then number of a month so let
07:45 - us take a CN and then let it be
07:48 - and so when we take input for one as a
07:54 - integer we give next int off and then we
07:59 - delete this switch notice en so what we
08:07 - supposed to both case is going to be one
08:11 - okay and then 3 so that means the month
08:19 - which all having 31 days so case 5 K 7 K
08:33 - 8 case 10 case 12 so when all these
08:50 - cases are this we don't give any other
08:53 - statement that our class we have not
08:56 - given break also so we give only one
08:59 - statement here number of days in this
09:10 - month is 31 so it is going to print 31
09:17 - number of days in this month is 31 so
09:21 - then we will just copy and paste few
09:25 - ports
09:39 - so the months which are having 30 days
09:43 - fourth month sixth month ninth month
09:51 - then laminate so it says number of base
09:56 - in multis 30 then in the case of case
10:05 - two we say number of base in this map is
10:19 - 28
10:20 - hi are 30 side 29 if we leave here so
10:36 - let us give this so in case if I say 50
10:44 - month so this runs we have forgotten to
10:50 - give the break here so this is the case
10:52 - where we don't do the case it takes us
10:54 - everything break and then after this
11:00 - awesome place
11:03 - so after this again break so for these
11:10 - many cases one statement is given and
11:13 - then we break it and then 4 6 9 and 11
11:17 - case we are given 30 days to print and
11:21 - then it well break and then for case 2
11:26 - we are given will get our protein if it
11:29 - is lip here and then click so default
11:31 - where there is no match for 80 excuse
11:34 - invalid input offset printing station
11:36 - compare now right-click
11:42 - so if I say five okay so the number of
11:47 - days in this meant is 13 1 clear this
11:50 - let's execute again per month to number
11:56 - of days in this man taste rotate our
11:58 - code in any flipping so let us see fog
12:04 - maybe 731 far for plate 30 nice
12:18 - Thank You students I hope you enjoyed
12:22 - learning suitcase in this class let us
12:25 - meet in next class and

Cleaned transcript:

dear students today we are going to see switch case statement this is a multiple branch selection statement this selection statement tests the expression against a list of integer R character constants when the math is found the statements associated with the constant are executed let us see a example program switch case program to take the first letter of the color and print a color according to it to take a input let us import the order to fill the scanner class switch case main method complex pancake point of string of arguments let us declare a character data type to take a character input character see it's our option we hope you can take that make this so let us create an object from the scanner class and obj is equal to new scanner of stem Dalton close this let us intimately use a double pumper printing love you the first rapper dolphin color let us create a method to take input so we assign what P is equal to the object name will be J dot next of dot character character at 0 so this will take input of a single character so now water we have taken the input is for the switch case to match the option switch SW o ET CH all in small so you are going to write the option there inside o P then open up bracket so here we are going to write KS as we are going to take a character so we should give inside the single quotation so way for violet and then we have a colon here it is not a semicolon we should be very careful that this is a colon and then write the statement what it is going to say it is going to print violet so system dot out dot print line of say let's print Wireless 050 then we have to write break surplus right next case case number holdback clink leg off we go then so let us copy and paste for that and just modify this e I D be in the sense blue blue g g agree then let us again copy this paste why is yellow it is alright so we know this vector so this is power and then set and when it doesn't find any match then the default is been executed what is default where there is no match form so we write x default and then we write maybe wrong input invalid input let us compile and this give the first letter of the process I say I chase integral so now if we give the value which is not matching then it should say invalid so I owe you so it says invalid input so in case of no break there it will not break and then automatically it falls to the next case also and then that code also it X you can let us see I have deleted two breaks from V and I so let us consider this program compare this now while you V as a input so what happens if I do we even violet indigo and blue also comes because there is no break after violet and after indigo so this is called fall through let us see near one more example program which says how many days in a month so for that we just modify this program so program to say the number of days in a month so when we want to take token then we will take the input as integer so we make you then number of a month so let us take a CN and then let it be and so when we take input for one as a integer we give next int off and then we delete this switch notice en so what we supposed to both case is going to be one okay and then 3 so that means the month which all having 31 days so case 5 K 7 K 8 case 10 case 12 so when all these cases are this we don't give any other statement that our class we have not given break also so we give only one statement here number of days in this month is 31 so it is going to print 31 number of days in this month is 31 so then we will just copy and paste few ports so the months which are having 30 days fourth month sixth month ninth month then laminate so it says number of base in multis 30 then in the case of case two we say number of base in this map is 28 hi are 30 side 29 if we leave here so let us give this so in case if I say 50 month so this runs we have forgotten to give the break here so this is the case where we don't do the case it takes us everything break and then after this awesome place so after this again break so for these many cases one statement is given and then we break it and then 4 6 9 and 11 case we are given 30 days to print and then it well break and then for case 2 we are given will get our protein if it is lip here and then click so default where there is no match for 80 excuse invalid input offset printing station compare now rightclick so if I say five okay so the number of days in this meant is 13 1 clear this let's execute again per month to number of days in this man taste rotate our code in any flipping so let us see fog maybe 731 far for plate 30 nice Thank You students I hope you enjoyed learning suitcase in this class let us meet in next class and
