00:01 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 43rd tutorial in the udk and in this
00:05 - tutorial we're going to be finally
00:06 - jumping into kizman and piecing all
00:09 - these pieces together or should I have
00:12 - said putting all these pieces together
00:14 - well either way that's what we're going
00:15 - to be doing so actually I'm done with
00:17 - the side view front view and top view so
00:19 - let's go ahead and expand the
00:20 - perspective view since that's the only
00:22 - one I really care about right now so now
00:25 - what I did in between this tutorial and
00:26 - the last tutorial is rebuild my lighting
00:28 - so let me go ahead and demo this level
00:30 - by hitting play from here and I'll show
00:32 - you guys what effect we're going to go
00:33 - for so basically we have this trigger in
00:36 - the middle of our map and whenever we
00:38 - bump into it we want this light to
00:39 - flicker on and off but check it out I'm
00:41 - bumping into it right now and this light
00:44 - isn't turning on and off and that's
00:45 - because we didn't set this up in Kismet
00:47 - yet so let's go ahead and hit escape and
00:49 - do that right now so again how you get
00:52 - to Kismet is you go ahead and click this
00:54 - open unreal kismat button right here and
00:56 - now this is kismat right here but what I
00:59 - want to do is throw this on the right
01:01 - hand side of my screen and throw my
01:02 - perspective view on the left hand side
01:04 - of my screen and I think that's going to
01:06 - be really easy to work with so I guess
01:09 - what I can do is I can build this quick
01:11 - example and teach you guys or excuse me
01:14 - talk you guys through what I'm doing
01:16 - however it might be easier if you just
01:19 - kind of watch me do it and then when
01:22 - everything's put together at the end
01:23 - you're going to be able to see the whole
01:25 - picture and probably give you a better
01:27 - idea of what's going on so if you guys
01:29 - don't exactly understand what I'm
01:31 - talking about as I'm putting these
01:33 - pieces together don't worry by the end
01:35 - of this video you'll be a pro or I won't
01:38 - say a pro kisman but you'll
01:40 - be not a pro but you'll be a novice at
01:46 - kisat a guaranteed novice so the first
01:49 - thing that you want to do is you're
01:51 - going to want to go ahead and in your
01:53 - perspective view select this trigger now
01:57 - when you have the trigger selected in
01:59 - Kismet go head and right click and hit
02:02 - new event using trigger and we're want
02:05 - to to select touch now let me go ahead
02:07 - and explain to you guys what an event is
02:10 - actually let me go ahead and explain
02:12 - this how kismat works is this you add a
02:15 - bunch of these things in this case we
02:18 - added an event and these things are just
02:20 - called objects so the three main things
02:24 - that we're going to be adding in this
02:25 - tutorial is the event an action and a
02:29 - variable an event is something that your
02:32 - user or your player can do it's
02:34 - something that happens in your game in
02:37 - this case it's going to be the user
02:39 - touching a trigger so everything starts
02:43 - with an event in real life maybe event
02:45 - would be jumping off a building and then
02:48 - the result of that is called an action
02:51 - so an action is basically a result of an
02:54 - event so in the udk the event is going
02:57 - to be touching this trigger and the
03:00 - action is going to be turning the light
03:01 - on and off in real life an event would
03:04 - be jumping off a building and the action
03:06 - would be breaking your neck so basically
03:08 - you need to start everything with an
03:10 - event and then that causes an action to
03:14 - happen so let's go ahead and now that we
03:16 - have our event set up again basically
03:19 - this is our event right here and this is
03:21 - the trigger that we can flip on and up
03:23 - let's go ahead and create an action so
03:26 - in order to create an action go ahead
03:28 - and right click in Kismet hit new action
03:31 - and then we're going to want to go ahead
03:33 - and toggle a light on and off as the
03:35 - result of this event so go ahead and hit
03:37 - toggle and toggle so check it out check
03:41 - out what's going on right now we want to
03:44 - connect this touch event to a turn on
03:48 - toggle so basically whenever our trigger
03:51 - is touched which is this light switch
03:53 - right here we're going to want to toggle
03:55 - something on and off but it just doesn't
03:58 - know that we want to toggle this light
04:00 - on and off because check this out if we
04:02 - made a huge level and we had like a
04:05 - thousand lights how would it know what
04:07 - light we wanted to toggle on and off
04:09 - well in order to associate this toggle
04:12 - action with light it needs an additional
04:14 - piece of information and that
04:16 - information is the fact that we're going
04:18 - to be working with this light right here
04:20 - so in order to tell the udk and Kizmet
04:23 - that the light that we want to toggle is
04:25 - this light go ahead and select that
04:28 - light and now go go ahead and back in
04:30 - Kismet right click somewhere in and now
04:34 - with once you right click go ahead and
04:36 - select new object variable Point light
04:39 - togg B again if you don't see that as an
04:42 - option make sure you have the light
04:44 - selected in your perspective View and by
04:47 - the way before I forget to mention this
04:49 - moving around all these objects is the
04:51 - exact same as in the material editor
04:54 - again if you select it and hold control
04:57 - you can move it around if you want
04:59 - delete one of these arrows just go ahead
05:01 - and hold alt and click on it and uh if
05:04 - you want to select multiple things just
05:06 - hold go ahead and hold control and ALT
05:09 - and then you can select multiple things
05:11 - and move them around so again exact same
05:14 - is working in the material editor so now
05:16 - what I want to do is for the event I
05:19 - want to say all right whenever you touch
05:22 - the trigger then toggle something on and
05:27 - so this is the event right here and this
05:29 - is the result aka the action and now it
05:33 - says all right I'm going to toggle
05:34 - something on but what the heck am I
05:36 - supposed to toggle on if you have like
05:37 - 50 different lights or laser beams or
05:40 - you know guns that you want to toggle on
05:42 - whatever the heck that means what am I
05:43 - supposed to toggle on so the target is
05:46 - basically where we tell it what to
05:48 - toggle on and in that case that's this
05:50 - variable the light switch right there so
05:53 - again let me go ahead and demo this
05:56 - first of all so I can prove to you guys
05:58 - that this is indeed working and I'm not
06:00 - just uh you know talking crap here so
06:02 - I'm going to hit play from here and keep
06:04 - your eyes on the static mesh right here
06:06 - see it's dim right now keep looking at
06:08 - it keep looking at it whenever I bump
06:10 - into this trigger now it now switches on
06:15 - so again if I go up to kizmat right here
06:18 - this is the event that happens the
06:20 - initial event is something that our user
06:23 - can do in this case the user can touch a
06:26 - light switch or a trigger as it's
06:28 - technically called
06:30 - now the action is a result of what
06:33 - happens whenever that event occurs now
06:35 - in this case the action is something
06:37 - getting toggled on and off and the
06:40 - target is basically what Target do you
06:42 - want to toggle on and off and in that
06:44 - case we just use that toggle light so
06:47 - hopefully you guys understand the basics
06:50 - of kisma again I just want to get a
06:52 - couple uh you know definitions out of
06:55 - the way a couple terminology and show
06:56 - you guys the basic interface but trust
06:58 - me we are nowhere near covering what
07:02 - everything we need to cover in a Kismet
07:04 - for example check it out whenever we hit
07:06 - Play From
07:08 - Here whoa hello let me go ahead and hit
07:11 - play from here and check it out this
07:14 - light switch turns on but step away from
07:16 - it and it stays on so how the heck are
07:19 - we supposed to turn that off well that's
07:21 - one example of what we can cover in the
07:23 - upcoming torial so for now that's all
07:25 - you guys get hopefully you got a little
07:27 - better feeling hopefully you guys are a
07:29 - little more comfortable with Kizmet but
07:31 - in the upcoming tutorials I'm going to
07:32 - show you guys some awesome sequences
07:34 - some awesome things you can do with
07:35 - Kizmet to make your game a whole lot
07:37 - more fun and interactive so thank you
