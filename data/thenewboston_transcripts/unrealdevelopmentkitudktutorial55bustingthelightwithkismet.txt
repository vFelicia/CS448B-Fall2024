00:00 - alright everyone now that we have our
00:02 - lighting setup we're ready to hop into
00:04 - kismet and start putting all the pieces
00:06 - together so the very first thing we want
00:08 - to do is select this light right here
00:11 - and this is the light that's going to be
00:13 - taking the damage so go ahead and hop
00:15 - into kismet all right click and hit new
00:18 - event using enter Pachter to take damage
00:22 - now first of all let's go ahead and bump
00:24 - this damage threshold down to let's say
00:27 - 10 actually let's go ahead and save five
00:30 - so basically whenever we shoot it then
00:32 - this output is going to fire so the very
00:36 - first thing we need to do is again
00:38 - remember from last Orioles I said we're
00:40 - going to be replacing this light which
00:42 - is the glowing light with this light
00:45 - which is the busted out light so go
00:47 - ahead and we need an object to symbolize
00:49 - this light so select that light right
00:52 - click and hit new object variable using
00:55 - inter bacter to now we're going to be
00:57 - having a bunch of variables so it's
00:59 - probably a good idea to comment these
01:01 - and just put like lit up light looks
01:05 - pretty good and now we need an object to
01:08 - symbolize this right here so go ahead
01:10 - and select that and right click new
01:13 - object and we'll just go ahead and write
01:15 - um busted light so now this object
01:21 - symbolizes this and this object
01:24 - symbolizes this and remember by default
01:26 - as soon as we start our level this is
01:28 - visible right here and this is hidden so
01:31 - just keep that in mind so now what we
01:33 - need is a way to toggle this off and
01:36 - this on and remember from tutorial like
01:39 - 52 or 50 or something we can do that by
01:42 - adding a new action toggle toggle hidden
01:47 - and this pretty much toggles between the
01:48 - visibility whether something is hidden
01:51 - or unhidden so now let me go ahead and
01:53 - drag that over and I'm just going to go
01:56 - ahead and hit toggle because if you hit
01:59 - hide it's going to make both of these
02:00 - disappear if you hit unhide it's going
02:03 - to be make both of them appear if you
02:05 - hit toggle it's going to change the
02:07 - state's boom so when we toggle this one
02:09 - since it's on by default it's going to
02:12 - hide it
02:13 - and since we toggle this one since it's
02:15 - off by default it's going to make up
02:17 - here pretty cool huh so that is where
02:19 - toggle comes in handy now let me just go
02:22 - ahead and actually select both of these
02:24 - and move them down a little bit and I
02:28 - guess I might as well play my level
02:30 - right now to show you guys before I move
02:31 - on the next step I'm going to have play
02:33 - from here and look what happens actually
02:36 - let me get a kind of better view that's
02:38 - probably a better view now by default
02:40 - this is I don't know what's it called
02:44 - unhidden visible and this is hidden over
02:47 - here so now let me go ahead and shoot
02:48 - this and look what happens this one
02:51 - hides and this one appears pretty cool
02:54 - huh so now let's hop back into kismet
02:57 - and get a better view in my perspective
02:59 - view and we want to change a couple more
03:02 - things the very first thing we want to
03:04 - do is we want to show off this spotlight
03:06 - so in order to do that we need to go
03:09 - ahead and I guess we can do this first
03:11 - go ahead and add a new object variable
03:14 - and this of course represents the
03:16 - spotlight I think that's pretty apparent
03:18 - we don't need to comment that so if you
03:20 - just go ahead and drag that over here
03:22 - and now what we need to do is toggle
03:24 - this now toggle hidden is for making
03:27 - things visible and invisible but
03:29 - whenever you're toggling lights you just
03:31 - need a regular toggle switch so go ahead
03:33 - and add new action toggle and toggle and
03:37 - now let me go ahead and output this to
03:40 - toggle we could go ahead and put it turn
03:43 - off because we want it to turn off the
03:45 - light but hey since we're using toggle
03:47 - yeah I just you know whatever floats
03:49 - your boat so now what's going to happen
03:52 - is this whenever we shoot our light it's
03:54 - going to turn our light switch off which
03:56 - is this light or I don't want to say
03:58 - like so it's just going to turn our
04:00 - spotlight off and it's also going to
04:02 - make this disappear and this up here so
04:08 - that's pretty cool so let me go ahead
04:09 - and preview that play from here make
04:12 - sure everything's working so far
04:14 - and also aside from making sure that
04:18 - this disappears in the spirits take a
04:20 - look at our ground where our spotlight
04:22 - is lighting up the ground and I'm not
04:26 - close enough there we go so now whenever
04:29 - I shoot that check it out our light has
04:31 - now turned off but the one last thing we
04:34 - need to change is we need to move this
04:36 - in the exact location of this so in
04:39 - order to do that probably the best way
04:40 - is to go in my side view scroll in even
04:44 - more and make sure that they sit right
04:48 - on top of each other and also in our a
04:53 - so make sure that they are indeed right
04:55 - on top of each other so that way
04:58 - whenever we replace them and make one
05:00 - visible and one is invisible it looks
05:02 - like it's the same light going on so now
05:06 - for one last time going to go ahead and
05:09 - hit play from here and check it out I'm
05:13 - going to go ahead let me get a real good
05:15 - angle to show you guys if I go ahead and
05:17 - shoot this the light now looks like it
05:20 - blows out and the spotlight disappears
05:23 - pretty cool huh and now you shoot it
05:26 - again and nothing happens just as we
05:29 - wanted to so I'm going to go ahead and
05:30 - shoot that one more time you know not
05:32 - really demonstrating anything more just
05:34 - having some fun it blows out and our
05:37 - spotlight disappears and if you wanted
05:39 - to a good idea would be to play a sound
05:42 - in here like maybe a glass breaking
05:44 - sound or light popping sound and it
05:47 - would just you know give a better effect
05:48 - but one last time what's going on is
05:51 - whenever our interp actor which was
05:54 - right here took damage the first thing
05:57 - it did is it toggled the spotlight off
05:59 - so this light shut off the game light
06:02 - the other thing it did is it took this
06:05 - emissive light right here or the light
06:10 - with the emissive properties and it
06:12 - switched it with this light right here
06:13 - which is basically the busted white mesh
06:17 - so hopefully you guys understand how to
06:19 - blow out lights using the UDK again a
06:22 - really cool effect and it
06:23 - enhances it if you would add a sound but
06:26 - you know you guys already know how to do
06:28 - that you don't need me to walk you
06:29 - through that so that's all I have for
06:31 - you in this story'll think yes for
06:32 - watching don't forget subscribe and I
06:34 - will smell you guys later
