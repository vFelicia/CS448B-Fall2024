00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:07 - going to be looking more at enumeration
00:09 - and we're going to be taking a look at
00:10 - get values now in Visual Basic
00:14 - there's libraries that you can use that
00:17 - are readily available in every single
00:20 - application you make now in this
00:21 - tutorial we're going to be using the
00:23 - system's namespace and we're going to be
00:25 - using the enum class so we'll go ahead
00:29 - and come over to our form 1vb
00:32 - and we'll just go ahead and make this a
00:35 - little bit bigger here so let's just go
00:39 - ahead and move these over we'll move
00:44 - these to the middle just to make it look
00:45 - a little bit better and now we will add
00:48 - to list boxes so we will add let's see
00:53 - where are they list box okay so we're
00:57 - going to have a list box for the values
01:01 - of the of the items in the enumeration
01:06 - sports and then we're going to have a
01:08 - list box for the names of the items in
01:10 - enumeration sport so we'll go ahead and
01:13 - set the name of this to list enum values
01:20 - and one set the name of this one to list
01:24 - enum names now we may not get two names
01:28 - in this tutorial but we'll just leave it
01:30 - there for the next one so let's go ahead
01:35 - and move this around a bit
01:43 - okay so now we'll go ahead and open our
01:46 - code for this and so what we're going to
01:49 - do is we are going to use systemtm
01:53 - get values to get the values of all the
01:56 - items in these sports enumeration now
02:00 - you can see our values are 0 1 & 2
02:04 - and let's say we don't know what these
02:07 - values are what we can use get values to
02:09 - do it
02:09 - so let's just minimize analyze sport
02:12 - here we'll come up here to button
02:15 - analyze and let's go ahead and before
02:21 - before it shows the message box let's go
02:24 - ahead and go and add each each of the
02:28 - values to the list box list values so
02:30 - we'll do this using a for each loop so
02:33 - for each item as integer because our
02:38 - enumeration uses integer value types for
02:41 - it and we'll type so for each item as
02:45 - integer in will use the system namespace
02:49 - dot enum the enumeration class and then
02:54 - we'll type dot get values so get values
03:01 - is going to have a single argument so
03:05 - it's going to be the enum type s system
03:07 - type so what we're going to do is we are
03:09 - going to type get type and if you worry
03:13 - to the description for this it says
03:14 - returns a system type object for the
03:17 - specified type name so it's just going
03:20 - to get the type of the enumeration that
03:23 - we're using and forget type we're going
03:27 - to need one parameter for that which is
03:30 - the object and the object is pretty
03:32 - simple it's just sports now bear with me
03:38 - here this might be a little confusing
03:39 - but let's go ahead and come down here
03:43 - and we'll press ENTER so we can fill in
03:46 - the rest of our for each loop so now
03:49 - we're going to do is we're going to type
03:50 - list values or let's see
03:54 - list enum values so list enum values dot
04:03 - items dot add and then we'll do item dot
04:08 - two strings so I'll just convert that
04:10 - integer to a string so what we did is we
04:14 - took our sports enumeration we didn't
04:19 - use my sports because that is an object
04:21 - all by itself we're accessing this
04:23 - enumeration directly to the enumeration
04:26 - so for each item as integer because
04:29 - enumerations take the data type integer
04:32 - or we set ours to take the data type
04:34 - integer you can do whatever you want
04:36 - so item has integer in and then we use
04:39 - the system in um the system namespace
04:42 - and the enum class then we use the
04:48 - function get values now for our
04:51 - arguments we used get type which is
04:56 - going to get the type of sports which is
04:58 - an integer type so get type in the
05:00 - argument of that is sports so it's just
05:02 - going to give us it's going to say it's
05:05 - integers so now we're going to do is
05:07 - we're going to type listing them values
05:09 - the items that add and I don't up
05:11 - tuition so it's going to go through this
05:13 - loop for every single value inside of
05:16 - sports and it's just going to add it to
05:18 - the list now let's go ahead and run this
05:20 - and see what happens here so we'll go
05:23 - ahead and click football here and we'll
05:26 - analyze that sport and you can see a
05:27 - message box pops up that says your sport
05:30 - is football and in all this box it lists
05:32 - all of the values inside of our
05:36 - enumeration sports so you may not think
05:40 - there is a practical use for this this
05:43 - function right now get values but later
05:46 - on when you're programming you may run
05:48 - into it the people who created net know
05:52 - what they're doing and they obviously
05:55 - people are going to need get values or
05:57 - else they wouldn't put it in there so
05:58 - I'm practice with this a little bit you
06:01 - probably won't be using it but it's a
06:02 - good thing to know
06:04 - and let me create myself you probably
06:05 - won't be using it for a while but it's a
06:08 - good thing to know so thanks for
06:09 - watching guys and stay tuned for the
06:10 - next tutorial
