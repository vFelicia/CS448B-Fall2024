00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to be using
00:07 - the remove attribute to undo say below
00:11 - re-enable this button if you like and
00:14 - we're gonna be focusing in on this
00:15 - remove attribute surrounding this of
00:18 - method that we're creating and
00:20 - essentially what we're doing is we have
00:21 - a check box with the label I agree
00:24 - when we click on this the continue
00:28 - button is enabled and we can go ahead
00:29 - and click it we also disable this check
00:33 - box as well so you know not really well
00:37 - too much of a practical application but
00:39 - there are practical applications to this
00:41 - but I just wanted to create something
00:42 - more sort of a pliable to real life to
00:44 - demonstrate the remove attribute
00:46 - function so this is essentially what
00:48 - we're going to be creating let's go over
00:49 - to our text editor and start writing it
00:52 - okay so the first thing that I'm going
00:54 - to go ahead and do is inside of my body
00:56 - area I'm going to create the check box
01:00 - itself and then also the button as well
01:02 - so I'm going to make the button to be
01:04 - auto I'm going to create the button with
01:06 - the attribute disabled which will
01:09 - automatically disable this button so
01:11 - let's go ahead and first we'll create
01:13 - the button I'm going to obviously create
01:16 - an input with the type of button button
01:19 - I'm gonna set a value to this just
01:22 - continue and I'm gonna set a property
01:25 - disabled I will just show you first in
01:27 - the browser it looks like this we can
01:30 - click on this button if we go ahead and
01:32 - set the disabled attribute to disabled
01:36 - and we refresh you can see that the
01:38 - button is now disabled so that's in the
01:40 - state that we want it we're going to go
01:42 - ahead and give this button an ID of
01:45 - continue which means that in jQuery we
01:47 - the we can then reference this as
01:49 - continue obviously you can use a class
01:52 - or you can select a button you know as a
01:55 - whole but in this case we want for very
01:58 - specific uses it won't belong to part of
02:00 - a class it's just a single item with a
02:02 - single ID
02:04 - okay so now that we've done that we just
02:05 - have our disabled button on our page I'm
02:08 - gonna go ahead and just surround the
02:10 - checkbox in and paragraph tags so we're
02:13 - gonna say input type equals and check
02:17 - box and then next to this I just want to
02:20 - write I agree so now we have this
02:22 - checkbox here which we can check and
02:24 - uncheck again I'm going to give this an
02:27 - ID just so we can reference it and this
02:29 - is just gonna be called agree so what's
02:32 - gonna happen now we need to think of how
02:34 - we're gonna you know set about this
02:37 - process we're gonna click on the check
02:38 - box once the check box has been checked
02:40 - we want to in a we want to enable this
02:44 - button and disable this button so let's
02:48 - go ahead over to ext J's which I've
02:50 - included on my page as well as jQuery J
02:53 - s and in Jake in ext ojs we want to
02:56 - first of all wait for the document to be
02:58 - ready so we say document dot ready and
03:01 - inside we have our function so this is
03:04 - going to run when the document is ready
03:07 - we want to bind an event handler let's
03:10 - just pull this down a bit to make it a
03:11 - little bit better we're gonna want to a
03:13 - bind an event handler to this checkbox
03:16 - so when it changes we can check for the
03:19 - status on and then we can go ahead and
03:21 - enable this button by removing this
03:24 - disabled attribute so let's go ahead and
03:27 - select our agree checkbox agree checkbox
03:33 - and then we want to bind the event
03:37 - handler change to this and inside of
03:40 - here will be a function which we pull
03:43 - down and in here we can just test this
03:45 - by alerting out check for example so now
03:49 - when we refresh and I click this you see
03:51 - that we get this we get this button this
03:54 - alert dialog box just up here so now
03:57 - that we know that once we check it we
03:58 - can perform you know an initial
04:01 - operation and the first thing that I
04:04 - want to do is I want to go ahead and
04:05 - disable the current element so let's go
04:08 - ahead and well actually we'll grab the
04:11 - state first and we'll have a look
04:12 - so I'm going to say state is equal to
04:14 - this referring to the currently selected
04:16 - object or element and I'm going to say
04:19 - that and that will take the value from
04:22 - this that the state essentially in
04:26 - actual fact let's go ahead and say
04:27 - attribute value and I'm going to alert
04:31 - out the state so now when I click on it
04:35 - you see that we alert on when I click on
04:38 - it again you see that we are like
04:41 - nothing
