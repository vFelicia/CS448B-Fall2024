00:00 - so 40% less than it originally was and I
00:04 - guess this is just an aesthetic choice
00:06 - but it makes it perhaps look a bit
00:08 - better when you've when you're actually
00:11 - dragging something and something is
00:13 - applied to the drag so when we're
00:15 - dragging something we know which item
00:17 - we're dragging okay so that's it for the
00:20 - options for now what we're going to do
00:23 - now is create another list and actually
00:25 - connect this list with it so let's go
00:28 - ahead and copy this unordered list and
00:30 - come down and paste it just in here and
00:34 - I'm just going to call this places
00:36 - instead of names and I'm going to type
00:38 - the names of a few places okay so now
00:45 - that we've got this list let's just go
00:47 - ahead and look at that in our browser
00:48 - you can see that we've got a list here
00:49 - and we're not unable to sort it
00:51 - obviously because we haven't allowed it
00:53 - to be sorted however this list is still
00:55 - available to be sorted now what we can
00:58 - actually do is inside the selector we
01:00 - can use a comma to actually specify
01:01 - another list we want to be sortable so
01:04 - in this case it's places so when we
01:07 - refresh we can actually sort this list
01:09 - here as well sorry
01:14 - places that was a spelling mistake so
01:18 - now we can actually sort this list as
01:19 - well as this one however you'll notice
01:22 - that we can't actually drag this down
01:24 - into this list because it doesn't
01:26 - connect with it so if for some reason
01:28 - you wanted to connect two different
01:30 - lists for example lists of options that
01:33 - have been generated from the database or
01:35 - any other lists and you wanted to
01:37 - actually allow them to interact with
01:39 - each other for example you might have
01:40 - two different lists and like this and
01:44 - you might want to associate particular
01:46 - elements with the other list you can use
01:48 - the connect with option in here now the
01:52 - connect with option takes as many
01:56 - different elements as you like and we
01:59 - specify these elements like so so for
02:02 - example if we wanted as we've selected
02:04 - names and places we can't really say
02:07 - that we want to connect this just with
02:09 - names because
02:11 - connecting their names with names and
02:13 - places with names so places will be
02:15 - connected with names but names won't be
02:17 - connected with places so you can see
02:20 - that we'll have this problem we can't
02:22 - drag this into here but we can drag this
02:24 - into here so now what we want to do is
02:26 - just go ahead and select places as well
02:30 - and that allows us to interchange items
02:33 - from each list so we can move things
02:35 - around and essentially what I've done
02:37 - here is just switch the contents of the
02:41 - list around so that's how we use connect
02:45 - with okay so the last thing we're going
02:47 - to take a look at is the events I'm only
02:50 - going to just demonstrate one event and
02:52 - that is update the reason for this is
02:55 - that update is probably the most useful
02:57 - event in terms of if you wanted to
02:59 - perhaps store a list in order that it's
03:02 - been moved around in in a database for
03:05 - example a database table there are quite
03:08 - a few events for this sortable
03:10 - interaction however I'm just going to
03:13 - take a look at update how we implement
03:15 - update how we can display data from this
03:18 - and then we're going to go ahead and end
03:20 - the tutorial but then afterwards go
03:23 - ahead to the jQuery documentation and
03:25 - you'll find a list of other events that
03:27 - might apply to you so I'm going to come
03:30 - and separate this and just down here I'm
03:32 - going to go ahead and use and set the
03:35 - update event and this is going to be
03:37 - equal to a function now inside this
03:39 - function is what's going to happen when
03:41 - the event has taken place so I'm going
03:47 - to say sorted now update will actually
03:51 - only update is the event that
03:55 - essentially happens when we move
03:57 - something then we let go and then when
04:00 - the when the element is updated so when
04:04 - the list has been updated so if we
04:06 - refresh the page you can see that as I
04:08 - move this just below here as soon as
04:11 - that's sorted we get this alert box
04:13 - sorted now this is the reason I'm
04:15 - looking into the update option update
04:18 - event and showing you this only for the
04:21 - simple fact that if you wanted to sort a
04:22 - list and then store the list
04:24 - the order that it's been stored in this
04:27 - will be the event you would use there
04:30 - are other events such as when the
04:32 - dragging dragging of each element starts
04:34 - etc but we're not going to be taking a
04:37 - look at them just yet okay so now that
04:40 - we've got this update function working
04:43 - we're not going to alert but what we're
04:44 - going to do is we're going to grab the
04:45 - contents of the div that spell these
04:48 - lists that's just been updated and we're
04:50 - going to display it just down here in a
04:52 - div so inside index dot PHP I'm just
04:55 - going to come down here and I'm going to
04:57 - create a div here and I'm going to call
05:00 - this sort status so now inside you ijs
05:06 - we're going to grab the contents of the
05:09 - list that we've just sorted into for
05:11 - example if I was to move that to there
05:15 - this list has now been updated so we can
05:18 - we can display the contents of this list
05:21 - if I was to move this here then we can
05:23 - display the contents of this list so we
05:26 - can update each list accordingly so
05:28 - let's go ahead and undo this so I'm
05:32 - going to take content is equal to and
05:37 - I'm going to select this dot text now
05:43 - this dot text is going to take the
05:46 - current text that's inside of here minus
05:49 - the tags or the HTML elements themselves
05:52 - so now what we can do is go ahead and
05:54 - apply this to the sort status div so
05:58 - store status text
06:01 - content so now what we're going to do is
06:04 - we're going to just go ahead and drag
06:05 - something you can see that now we've got
06:07 - Billy Alex and Ashley which is the order
06:09 - that this particular list is in and then
06:12 - again if I was to move that up there it
06:14 - would be the same it would update it if
06:16 - I was to move an item down here we would
06:18 - then have Billy London and Sheffield so
06:21 - we're essentially just returning the
06:24 - list in its text format depending on
06:28 - which list we've commonly dragged into
06:30 - so this is a particularly brief overview
06:34 - of the sortable interaction in jQuery
06:38 - however it's not mainly used in terms of
06:43 - actually sorting lists it's more like
06:44 - menu options for example if we had these
06:48 - li elements instead and didn't have an
06:50 - unordered list these might be divs for
06:53 - for example and menu options down a page
06:56 - or foreign categories it could be
06:59 - absolutely anything and you could use
07:00 - this sort status this sort sortable
07:04 - interaction to actually sort particular
07:06 - lists you could also then in here once
07:10 - the update has been complete update a
07:12 - database with the order that the user
07:14 - has placed these lists in I'm not going
07:16 - to be covering in this tutorial because
07:18 - I've just taken a basic look at some of
07:21 - the options and one of the events
07:22 - available to sortable however if you do
07:24 - need any more information the jQuery
07:26 - library has everything you might need so
07:29 - if you are wondering how you might do a
07:32 - particular particular thing with this
07:35 - you can go ahead and look that up but
07:38 - for now this is just a basic overview of
07:41 - sortable list interaction in jQuery
