00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - tenth XHTML tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial what I'm going to be talking
00:06 - about is how to resize an image because
00:09 - sometimes you just have images on your
00:11 - website that are just either they're
00:13 - probably way too big or maybe they're
00:15 - way too long width wise so sometimes we
00:18 - need to learn how to resize an image so
00:21 - they fit better on our website so what I
00:23 - did before this tutorial is I went ahead
00:26 - and I took a huge image of this video
00:30 - game right here Madden what year is it
00:32 - Madden 10 and I threw in my directory so
00:35 - I you know I didn't want to show you
00:38 - guys me doing that because it would just
00:39 - waste time but this image is way larger
00:42 - than we need for our website so we need
00:45 - to figure out a way to resize it and put
00:47 - it on our website so first and foremost
00:50 - what we want to do is actually get on
00:52 - our website before we start shrinking
00:54 - stuff so let's go ahead and we know how
00:56 - to do that image let's go ahead and put
01:00 - our ending tag right now and for the
01:02 - source the name is Madan one dot jpg so
01:07 - let's go ahead and save this and see how
01:08 - it looks
01:09 - oh mama this is like the biggest image
01:13 - ever I was ever gonna be to be able to
01:15 - tell what that is that's like a
01:17 - billboard size image right there so we
01:19 - want to shrink it so it's like only 150
01:21 - pixels tall so in order to shrink that
01:24 - image here's what we need to do not only
01:27 - does the image parameter or excuse me
01:30 - the image tag take an attribute called
01:32 - source but it also takes another
01:34 - attribute called height and we can set
01:37 - this equal to a ever number of pixels we
01:39 - want I want my image to be a hundred and
01:42 - fifty pixels tall so for height set it
01:44 - equal to 150 now go ahead and save this
01:48 - save this what the heck save this and
01:51 - refresh your screen gotta get all my s
01:55 - is in order and refresh it and see what
01:57 - we get yeah that's a whole lot better
02:00 - than that big mumbo-jumbo billboard
02:02 - poster we had on there earlier so now we
02:05 - have a beautiful small 150 pixel tall
02:08 - Madan 10
02:10 - image so you know if you were making a
02:13 - site like eBay or something that might
02:14 - come in handy
02:15 - so before I just let you guys go I want
02:18 - to talk to you guys about a couple
02:19 - things you know this is gonna be useful
02:23 - information later on whenever you've
02:25 - resize an image this way it doesn't you
02:28 - know make your you might be thinking
02:30 - this all right I'll make all my images
02:32 - smaller in that way my webpage will load
02:34 - faster because the file size will be
02:36 - smaller it doesn't work like that
02:38 - what your browser is doing is it's
02:40 - loading that huge big image you know
02:43 - downloading however many bits that is
02:45 - and then it's shrinking it so you're not
02:48 - loading a small image you're loading the
02:50 - huge image and you're just making it
02:52 - look smaller so in that sense your web
02:55 - page is not going to speed up at all it
02:57 - has to download that huge image no
02:59 - matter wha so it would be better if you
03:03 - wanted your web page to load faster if
03:05 - you went ahead into a program like
03:07 - Photoshop or something and actually took
03:10 - this image and shrunk it so the image
03:13 - size was smaller itself and then you
03:16 - just posted that on your website so in
03:18 - that way that's what you should do you
03:21 - shouldn't always you know take huge
03:24 - images and just post them and resize
03:26 - them down like I showed you right here
03:27 - what you should do the preferred way is
03:30 - going to a fit or excuse me an image
03:33 - editing program and make it a smaller
03:36 - file and then put it on your website so
03:40 - that's a lot easier way it saves your
03:41 - browser's excuse me your browser from
03:43 - doing any extra work so we're saying all
03:45 - right Bucky why the heck would you even
03:48 - teach me that if that's the preferred
03:50 - way to do so well that Way's helpful
03:53 - when you know you are going to be making
03:56 - an image like maybe you're making a
03:57 - website with a logo it's useful when you
04:00 - add images to the website but what if
04:02 - you had a website like amazon.com or
04:04 - eBay or even Facebook where you loud
04:08 - users the upload images of any size and
04:10 - you shrunk them down to what you wanted
04:13 - them going to be well I think I just
04:15 - answered my own question this is only
04:17 - useful whenever you're going to have a
04:19 - website like eBay where you can say
04:22 - right upload any size image you want and
04:24 - I'm gonna shrink them so they all fit
04:26 - nice and neat that is when you would
04:29 - want to use something like that but
04:30 - trust me making websites like eBay and
04:32 - Amazon are a couple tutorials away from
04:34 - now so anyways that is the basics of
04:37 - resizing image when you should do it and
04:40 - when you shouldn't do it and why it
04:42 - doesn't save you any loading time to do
04:44 - it this way say anyways thank you guys
04:46 - for watching and the next story I'll
04:48 - probably be talking a little more about
04:49 - images maybe finishing them up so
04:51 - anyways practice adding some images your
04:53 - website and let me know how it goes so
04:56 - thank you guys for watching I'll see you
04:58 - later
