00:00 - alright guys welcome back and in this
00:02 - video all we're going to do is we're
00:04 - going to take the MAC address and format
00:06 - it into a human readable format kind of
00:09 - the standard convention because right
00:11 - now we unpacked it but it's all broken
00:14 - up into chunks and the standard
00:16 - convention for a MAC address is to have
00:18 - two decimal places in there each
00:21 - separated by a colon
00:23 - so like a a : BB yada yada yada tomato
00:27 - tomato tomahto
00:28 - so we already made this function and get
00:30 - MAC address so that's what we're going
00:33 - to do let me add a comment I'll say a
00:34 - return hopefully formatted MAC address
00:41 - all right
00:43 - so define get MAC address and what we're
00:47 - going to do is we're just going to test
00:48 - it in the bytes address so actually let
00:53 - me give myself some more lines I like to
00:57 - be able to scroll around oh yeah there
01:00 - we go May there we are
01:02 - alright so this is pretty much um the
01:05 - address that's broken up into chunks
01:07 - it's an iterable and from here what I
01:10 - want to do first is just convert it to a
01:12 - proper string format each chunk so I'm
01:16 - going to take bytes string I'm going to
01:19 - set this equal to map and if you guys
01:21 - don't know what the map function is
01:22 - again look at my Python 3 tutorials it's
01:25 - basically a way that you can pass a
01:27 - function in here and in iterable and it
01:31 - runs each item in there through your
01:33 - function so what do we want to do with
01:35 - each chunk of the mac address like this
01:38 - chunk in this chunk of this chunk well
01:40 - all we want to do is we want to format
01:41 - it to two decimal places so have single
01:45 - quotes curly brackets and if you're
01:48 - right colon 0 to X that's what that is
01:52 - going to do dot format holy alright dot
01:57 - format we're never using map you don't
02:01 - use those curly braces and what do you
02:04 - want to loop through or just this right
02:08 - here so basically what this is doing is
02:11 - taking all those chunks and
02:13 - formatting them correctly pretty much
02:16 - stripping out everything and making sure
02:18 - that we only have two decimal places for
02:20 - each one but now what we need to do is
02:22 - we need to take each of those chunks and
02:24 - make sure that they're all uppercase and
02:27 - also join them together with colons so
02:32 - how do we do that well let's just say
02:34 - MAC address that's what's going to be
02:38 - the ending return value and just set
02:40 - this equal to colon in between single
02:44 - quotes and what do you want to join
02:46 - together well let's just go ahead and
02:48 - join together these chunks and we also
02:52 - want to make sure everything is
02:54 - uppercase so this made the proper chunks
02:58 - and this just joins them together with a
03:01 - colon in between all of them and
03:04 - actually instead of even doing this
03:08 - return MAC address what we can actually
03:10 - do is just return this and it'll save us
03:17 - a little bit of you know clutter looking
03:20 - good so there you go and let me go ahead
03:22 - and write bit uh I'm not like a quick
03:25 - little demo of what it is so be like a a
03:28 - BB CC DD e FF and these are of course
03:36 - colons not semi colons and that'll just
03:39 - help anyone reading later on I'm going
03:42 - to be putting this on get help later on
03:43 - so if you guys want to make sure to
03:46 - follow me on github and you'll be
03:47 - updated on everything but that is the
03:50 - format that we are going to be returning
03:52 - so now we have a nice beautiful properly
03:55 - formatted Mac address that we can
03:57 - display to the user we're now ready to
03:59 - move on to the next step
