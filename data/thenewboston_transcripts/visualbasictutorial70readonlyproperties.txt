00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - finishing our customer program that uses
00:11 - structures and if you this doesn't look
00:13 - familiar to you go back to tutorial 68
00:15 - and that's where we start building this
00:17 - program so um enough rambling let's go
00:19 - ahead and get started so um we created a
00:21 - structure we created an object of that
00:25 - structure and let's go and take this out
00:27 - just to make it a little bit more
00:28 - readable um uh we set the values of that
00:32 - structure and we called display customer
00:34 - and passed our object to it and so
00:36 - basically what display customer does is
00:39 - it takes a sorry about that it takes a c
00:43 - customer and it sets the text of the
00:45 - text value text first name uh to custo
00:49 - customer. first name so now what we're
00:51 - going to do is we're going to fill in
00:53 - the name field so the way we're going to
00:56 - do this is we're going to use a um a
01:00 - readon property now if you don't know
01:02 - what properties are then go back and uh
01:04 - to one of the earli tutorials um because
01:06 - this will just confuse you now one thing
01:09 - about structures is that you you don't
01:12 - um you aren't constrained to only use uh
01:15 - variables and values inside of your
01:17 - structure you can also use methods and
01:19 - properties and other stuff so in our
01:21 - case we're going to create a property so
01:24 - we'll go ahead and type public now we
01:27 - don't want the property to be able to
01:29 - set a value value uh because there's no
01:31 - need to so what we're going to do is
01:34 - we're going to type
01:36 - readon property so what this says is um
01:41 - make a property but don't let us make a
01:43 - set function so it will let us use a get
01:46 - but we cannot use set so now what we're
01:49 - going to do is we're just going to give
01:50 - a name for this and we'll set it equal
01:52 - to name for the uh name field right
01:55 - here and now we need to specify a data
01:58 - type for it so we'll just do as string
02:01 - and now you can see that when we press
02:03 - enter it adds the get and end property
02:06 - for us you can see it doesn't add the
02:07 - set for us because it because it is read
02:10 - only so now what we need to do is we
02:13 - need to add first name and last name to
02:15 - each other so we will just
02:17 - type
02:19 - return first name and then we'll just
02:22 - add a space in between
02:24 - that and then last
02:28 - name so what this is going to do do is
02:30 - the property name is going to be equal
02:32 - to first name plus a space plus last
02:36 - name so now what we need to do is we
02:38 - need to set the um we need to put that
02:42 - inside of this text box right here which
02:44 - is text name so we'll scroll down here
02:47 - and we will find our display customer
02:50 - sub so you can see we set text first
02:53 - name. text text last name. text and text
02:55 - email. text okay so now we come up here
02:59 - to the first first line of display
03:00 - customer and we're just going to type
03:02 - text name. text and we will set it equal
03:05 - to cust do
03:10 - name now name is read as a value uh you
03:14 - can see that it gives us uh instead of
03:17 - the Blue Square we are going to get this
03:20 - little um pointing finger right here to
03:22 - a list and that just represents a
03:24 - property Um this can also represent
03:27 - constants and other things inside a
03:28 - Visual Basic once you learn what these
03:30 - icons mean um you'll be able to see
03:32 - things really fast and know what they
03:34 - are and it it may not seem like it but
03:37 - it helps a lot when you're um
03:38 - programming
03:40 - anything so um now let's go up here and
03:44 - we will run this and if we type list
03:47 - customer we get Jim Jones first name is
03:50 - Jim last name is Jones and we've got the
03:53 - email jones. Jim
03:55 - live.com so now let's go ahead and I'll
03:58 - just show you that we can create more
04:00 - than one customer so we'll just type
04:02 - private object new
04:06 - customer as
04:08 - customer now these two are completely
04:10 - independent of each other and they are
04:12 - independent of the customer structure
04:14 - because we are creating what's called an
04:16 - object of it which creates one of them
04:19 - so um we'll go ahead and come down here
04:22 - and we will set the values for object
04:24 - new customer so object new
04:28 - customer do first name let's equal that
04:33 - let's set that equal to Sam and then
04:36 - object new customer. last name and I'm
04:40 - not going to put my real last name on
04:41 - here let's just do
04:44 - um hello that'll be my last name sounds
04:47 - like a good last name and then we'll do
04:49 - object new
04:51 - customer.
04:53 - email
04:55 - equals let's just
04:58 - do
05:00 - um my
05:04 - email at
05:09 - programmer. okay so now we can just go
05:13 - ahead and instead of using object
05:16 - customer we will send object new
05:19 - customer and we'll go ahead and run
05:23 - this and you can see that we have our
05:25 - normal form and if we click list
05:27 - customer we get Sam hello first name Sam
05:30 - last name hello and email my email
05:33 - program.com so that was just a little
05:35 - demonstration to show you that um you
05:38 - can create as many structures as you
05:39 - want and they are stored as objects and
05:41 - they are completely independent of each
05:43 - other and each can have different values
05:44 - for the variables and they won't affect
05:46 - each other so
05:48 - um we also talked about readon
05:50 - properties uh which was the main focus
05:52 - of this tutorial there's also such thing
05:54 - as write only properties which um
05:57 - instead of giving you only Git You you
05:59 - only get the uh the set function uh
06:02 - which we'll be covering later on a
06:03 - couple couple tutorials after this
06:05 - because we don't need that in anything
06:07 - else so um thanks for watching guys and
06:09 - stay tuned for the next tutorial
