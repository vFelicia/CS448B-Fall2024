00:01 - right here we have addition with
00:03 - parameters right here we have two
00:05 - squares and a
00:07 - rectangle by definition of a square all
00:10 - four sides are exactly the
00:15 - same so right here this side says that
00:18 - it is 10 units long let's say the units
00:20 - are
00:22 - inches if this is 10 in long so is this
00:26 - side so is this side and so is this side
00:29 - same here
00:30 - if this is 2 units long this is 2 units
00:34 - long this is 2 units long this is two
00:36 - units long but a rectangle not all all
00:39 - four sides are exactly the same where
00:41 - only two sides are exactly the same to
00:44 - one another so these two sides are
00:46 - 12 and these two
00:50 - sides are four units
00:52 - long to find the perimeter of the square
00:55 - you have to add all four sides together
00:58 - the perimeter is the distance along the
01:02 - outside so in order to do let's change
01:05 - colors in order to do the perimeter of a
01:08 - square You' have to add 10 + 10 + 10 +
01:17 - 10 to make this more simple we add 10
01:20 - and 10 is 20 10 and 10 is
01:24 - 20 and 20 and 20 is 40 so the perimeter
01:29 - of the square
01:30 - square is
01:32 - 40 in always put your
01:39 - unit for the square on the
01:43 - middle it's 2 units
01:46 - long so we do 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 2 and 2 is 4
01:57 - + 2 and 2 is 4 four and four is8 8
02:07 - in for the rectangle you'd have to add
02:10 - these two
02:11 - sides and these two
02:14 - sides
02:16 - so 12 and 12 + 4 and
02:23 - 4 12 and 12 2 and 2 is 4 1 and 1 is
02:27 - 2 4 and 4 is
02:31 - 8 8 + 4 8 9 10 11 12 put down the two
02:37 - carry over the 1 2 and 1 is three is 32
02:42 - units and that is how you find the
02:44 - perimeter of a square and a rectangle
