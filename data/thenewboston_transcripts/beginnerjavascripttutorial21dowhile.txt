00:00 - all righty then welcome back to your
00:03 - 21st tutorial and in this tutorial we're
00:06 - going to be going over a special type of
00:08 - loop called the do Loop yes this is what
00:11 - you guys have been waiting for the do
00:13 - Loop so I can't remember what stor was I
00:16 - want to say the last tutorial but it's
00:19 - been a couple days since I've been at my
00:20 - computer so I'm not positive but a
00:23 - couple tutorials ago we went over a
00:25 - special kind of loop called The Wild
00:27 - Loop and what this Loop basically did is
00:30 - it tested a condition and so long as
00:33 - that condition was true it ran a bit of
00:35 - code so you have a condition test it and
00:38 - if it's true run a bit of code over and
00:40 - over until you T the stop basically well
00:43 - what the do Loop does is basically take
00:46 - this structure and it flips it upside
00:48 - down it's going to run a bit of code
00:50 - first and then it's going to test if a
00:53 - condition was true and if it is true
00:55 - it's going to run it again until it's
00:56 - false so it basically since it runs the
01:00 - code before it tests the condition even
01:03 - if that condition is false it already
01:05 - ran the code once so anytime you want to
01:08 - ensure that you run your code at least
01:10 - once this is what you need to do so
01:13 - that's basically it let's go ahead and
01:15 - uh take a look at an example right here
01:17 - and whoa easy script boxes don't get
01:20 - that close to each other so let's go
01:22 - ahead and make a counter variable um
01:24 - make it X I'm going to set my equal to 5
01:27 - because you know starting at zero and
01:28 - one it's getting old let's start at five
01:31 - cuz you know why not my tutorial so now
01:34 - the structure for the do all Loop is
01:36 - this go ahead and write do do o and then
01:40 - go ahead and write whatever code you
01:43 - want and I'm just going to go ahead and
01:46 - write like
01:48 - document right um let's go ahead and
01:51 - write the variable first so we can see
01:53 - so it'll be five to begin with and then
01:55 - go ahead and write stupid something
01:57 - stupid on the screen like hello and then
01:59 - just go ahead and add a line break
02:01 - because we're going to be printing this
02:02 - out a bunch of times and we don't want
02:04 - it all on the same line and when you're
02:06 - done of course add your semicolon AKA
02:09 - semicolon and now go ahead and increment
02:12 - X because we don't want it to stay in
02:14 - the same number the whole time or else
02:16 - this Loop's going to run forever so now
02:19 - after you have your coding syntax now is
02:22 - where you put the while right here so we
02:25 - have to give it condition to test just
02:27 - write like while X is less than or equ
02:29 - equal to 20 and then add your semicolon
02:33 - at the end so as you can see it's set up
02:36 - a little bit different than the basic
02:38 - while loop first of all it has a
02:39 - semicolon at the end and second you have
02:42 - your condition before your test and also
02:45 - the special do keyword or you know
02:49 - special word whatever you want to call
02:50 - it so let's go ahead and save this and
02:52 - take a look at it and see what it does
02:54 - actually let me go ahead and add some
02:55 - space there I make it easier to see it
02:58 - goes five six low sow8 AOW 9 AOW 10 low
03:02 - I won't go through them all so it goes
03:05 - all the way until it says X is less than
03:07 - or equal to 20 and then it stops so
03:10 - let's go ahead and take a look one more
03:11 - time why this
03:14 - happens stupid window 7 shaking the
03:16 - boxes put them down shaking them and put
03:19 - them up but when I'm trying to make a
03:20 - tutorial I'm like yeah this window right
03:22 - here doesn't work like that so
03:24 - anyways what we have here is a variable
03:28 - X that start at five
03:30 - so this code regardless of what the
03:32 - condition is it didn't even look at the
03:34 - condition yet it's running right now and
03:36 - then it says all right I'm done running
03:38 - the code and now you want me to run it
03:41 - again as long as X is less than 20 well
03:45 - the next time I run since we increment
03:47 - to X it's going to be six and I'm going
03:49 - to keep doing this keep incrementing X
03:51 - each time 789 all the way to 20 and then
03:55 - once it gets to 21 it says all right is
03:58 - X less than or equal to 20 no it's
04:00 - greater than 20 so that's when your Loop
04:03 - shuts off and quits so that's why you go
04:06 - five all the way to 20 because 20 is in
04:09 - fact less than or equal to 20 it's equal
04:11 - to 20 so that's the basics of a doall
04:14 - loop um let me show you a case scenario
04:17 - where X could be like
04:19 - 35 see in this example the condition
04:22 - isn't true at all but this Loop is going
04:24 - to go ahead and run one time so let me
04:27 - just go ahead and run that 35 L and then
04:30 - it's going to shut off immediately after
04:32 - that so whereas if we were to stick this
04:34 - in a while loop it would never run since
04:36 - it tested the condition first but since
04:38 - we're in a do while loop what it does is
04:40 - it runs the code at least one time and
04:44 - then it tests the condition so by the
04:46 - time it sees that it's false it already
04:49 - ran it at least once so that's why it
04:51 - printed out so anyways that's a main
04:53 - difference between a do Loop or excuse
04:56 - me a do W Loop and a basic while loop is
04:58 - pretty much a Loop flipped upside down
05:01 - and you guarantee to run it at least one
05:03 - time so you're going to see when we're
05:05 - programming when this is going to come
05:06 - in h handy and when a while loop is
05:09 - going to be necessary but for now just
05:11 - want to give you guys the basics so
05:12 - thank you guys for watching um if you
05:14 - have any questions don't forget I have a
05:16 - website and a forum you can check out
05:18 - and also don't forget to subscribe so I
05:19 - will see you guys later
