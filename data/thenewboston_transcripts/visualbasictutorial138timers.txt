00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:04 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:06 - talking about timers so let's go ahead
00:09 - and create a new project we'll go ahead
00:12 - and select windows forms application and
00:15 - we will set the name to timers so let's
00:25 - go ahead and we will make the form a
00:28 - little bit smaller we will add a list
00:33 - box and two buttons so here's our list
00:37 - box
00:38 - we've got button 1 and button 2 so we'll
00:45 - just make this a little bit bigger and
00:47 - now all we need to do is set the text of
00:50 - button 1 to start and then the text of
00:54 - button 2 to stop we'll go ahead and come
00:59 - over here to start and we'll set the
01:00 - name to button start and then for stop
01:04 - we're gonna need button stop okay so
01:08 - let's come over here to our tool box and
01:10 - we will scroll down and let's find the
01:17 - timer so if you drop down your
01:24 - components submenu right here you're
01:29 - gonna go ahead and see the timer right
01:31 - here so just like any of the dialogues
01:34 - you don't need to drag it out on your
01:35 - form because you cannot actually see it
01:37 - so we'll just double click on timer and
01:39 - you can see it has been added to our
01:40 - form so let's go ahead and click on time
01:46 - come over here to the lightning bolt and
01:48 - we'll just double click on tick so what
01:51 - the tick does is every time the timer
01:54 - ticks and you can set the properties of
01:56 - this and set the interval so this is
01:59 - milliseconds so 100 milliseconds is a
02:01 - tenth of a second let's just set our
02:03 - interval to 5000 milliseconds which is
02:06 - five seconds so every time the timer
02:09 - takes let's go ahead and add an
02:12 - to the listbox so we go ahead and do
02:16 - private number as integer and we'll set
02:22 - it equal to zero so whatever it takes we
02:25 - will add it to the list box so list box
02:28 - 1 dot items dot add and we will add
02:33 - number let's go ahead and just add 1 to
02:36 - number so it's gonna add it to the list
02:40 - box and then increment it by 1 now 5
02:43 - seconds is gonna take a pretty long time
02:45 - so let's just go ahead and shrink this
02:47 - down to 1 second so we've got 1 second
02:51 - 1000 milliseconds now we'll double click
02:55 - on the button start click and whenever
02:57 - they click start we want to go ahead and
02:59 - start the timer
02:59 - so we'll September 1 dot start so it's
03:04 - gonna start ticking the timer and
03:07 - whenever they click stop let's go ahead
03:10 - and stop the timer
03:11 - so timer 1 dot stop so let's go ahead
03:15 - and run this and if we click start we
03:19 - wait a second and 0 shows up 1 2 3 and
03:23 - this is happening at intervals of 1
03:25 - second now if we did all of this at once
03:28 - and added them all at the same time it
03:30 - would be almost instantaneous but since
03:33 - we are pausing well not really pausing
03:36 - we're using a timer and every time that
03:37 - ticks were adding so let's go ahead and
03:41 - change the interval and we can see the
03:43 - change in time so let's change it to 5
03:46 - thousand milliseconds we'll go ahead and
03:50 - click start
03:53 - you can see we wait five seconds and
03:56 - zero shows up if we wait another five
03:58 - seconds the one's gonna show up so go
04:04 - ahead and practice with timers they are
04:06 - very useful you put the code that you
04:08 - want to run in during each tick and then
04:11 - you can have certain actions start and
04:13 - stop your timer so go ahead and practice
04:16 - with those and once you got those down
04:17 - go ahead and move on to the next
