00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live camera for the new boss
00:05 - Tim and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:07 - continuing with we're gonna continue
00:08 - working on the car application so we'll
00:12 - go ahead and just open it up here we'll
00:17 - wait for it to prepare prepare the
00:20 - solution okay so if you remember from
00:23 - the previous tutorials we created the
00:25 - form that will allow users to add cars
00:29 - to their list now what if they want to
00:32 - hit cancel and not add a car well we're
00:35 - gonna I'm gonna show you how to do that
00:36 - today and if none of this is familiar to
00:38 - you you might want to go back and start
00:40 - from the beginning of the series so what
00:44 - we need to do is let's come over here to
00:46 - our new car VB class and we need to
00:51 - create a variable so we'll just call it
00:57 - will create as and we're gonna make it a
01:02 - balloon and we're gonna go ahead and set
01:04 - it equal to false at the beginning and
01:08 - now let's come down here to the button
01:13 - add car event handler and if I click the
01:17 - button add right here it's gonna go
01:20 - ahead and add their car to the list so
01:23 - I'll just type it will create equals
01:26 - true so if they click Add it's going to
01:29 - be equal to true but if they click
01:32 - cancel let's go ahead and type me dot
01:38 - close we don't have to set the value to
01:40 - false because it's already false so
01:44 - let's go back here to form our BB and
01:47 - you can see here that when they create a
01:49 - car or that's not it
01:52 - let's do
01:57 - button create car right here okay so
02:01 - when I click create car it's gonna go
02:04 - ahead and do all of this stuff right
02:06 - here now let's go ahead and add an if
02:11 - statement right underneath add new car
02:14 - show dialog so if add new car dot we
02:21 - will create is equal to true then we
02:24 - want to go ahead and create this new car
02:27 - so we'll just end if right here so it's
02:31 - only going to run if that is equal to
02:32 - true now what we can do is let's just
02:36 - take all this code right here and we
02:39 - will copy it or we'll cut it ctrl X
02:44 - let's just go ahead and paste it under
02:46 - create car so now we have taken this and
02:49 - put it in another sub so that we can
02:52 - call this sub wherever we want and it's
02:53 - not limited to only in button create car
02:56 - so we'll just type create car and when
03:03 - you eat right there so whenever they
03:05 - click that it's going to create a car so
03:07 - we'll go ahead and run this and see if
03:09 - it works so we'll click new car we'll
03:15 - set the name of the car to GMC Tahoe
03:21 - we'll set the color to green the number
03:24 - of doors will be five the horsepower
03:27 - will be let's just say 200 we'll go
03:30 - ahead and click add you can see that we
03:33 - have our Tahoe right here and we can get
03:35 - the info of it now okay at another car
03:38 - and this car will call it Honda Civic
03:44 - we'll set the color to blue set the
03:50 - number of doors let's just make it a two
03:52 - door I'm gonna set the horsepower to 180
03:55 - and if we click cancel you can see that
03:59 - it does not add our car to the list
04:02 - because it the boolean value is set to
04:07 - false and because it was set to false
04:09 - it's
04:10 - not going to complete that operation so
04:14 - go ahead put this go to did code in if
04:16 - you have it it's very simple you can
04:19 - play around with it change it I
04:20 - encourage you to changes to see what you
04:22 - can do to make the program better and
04:24 - then once you've done that go ahead and
04:25 - move on to the next tutorial
