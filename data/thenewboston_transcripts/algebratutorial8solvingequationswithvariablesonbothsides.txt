00:00 - so today we're gonna focus on solving
00:05 - equations with variable terms on both
00:08 - sides so what we're always gonna do
00:11 - first is collect our like terms and then
00:15 - we're gonna after we do that we're going
00:16 - to solve our equation so first thing
00:20 - we're gonna do is we're gonna collect
00:22 - all of our X's together and then all of
00:27 - our numbers together so for X and then
00:34 - remember how we solve equations we would
00:36 - subtract this from both sides so for X
00:39 - minus X is 3x and then I'm going to move
00:43 - this six over so I'm going to plus 6 on
00:46 - the side and plus 6 on this side so we
00:49 - get 3x is equal to 15 and now that we've
00:54 - collected our terms we're gonna solve
00:55 - this just like any other equation by
00:59 - dividing by 3 and getting x equals 5 ok
01:06 - so let's do some more examples so
01:10 - remember the property we use when we
01:13 - have something written like this we're
01:17 - always gonna do this first before we
01:20 - collect our like terms so 2 times
01:23 - negative 3a gives me negative 6a plus 2
01:27 - times 5 which is 10 is equal to negative
01:30 - 4 times 9 which is negative 36 minus 4
01:36 - times 4 16
01:41 - I mean mistake this should this is an a
01:48 - not a nine so this should say negative
01:50 - for a so now we're gonna collect our
01:55 - terms together so I'm gonna move this
01:59 - six this way and this 16 this way so I'm
02:04 - going to plus 6a to both sides and I get
02:07 - 10 8 I'm going to plus 16 to both sides
02:11 - and then when I get 26 is equal to 10
02:16 - a oh sorry that was a negative so this
02:23 - should say negative 4a plus 6a which is
02:27 - 2a divide both sides by 2 and we get a
02:31 - is equal to 13 now we're gonna do the
02:36 - same thing down here distribute this 2
02:38 - and 2x minus 6 is equal to X minus 1
02:48 - plus 7 we can drop these bars or these
02:52 - parenthesis because we're gonna collect
02:55 - all of our like terms anyway so we're
03:00 - gonna subtract this x over we get X
03:03 - minus 6 equals negative 1 plus 7 we're
03:06 - gonna add 6 over get X is equal to
03:11 - negative 1 plus 7 which is positive 6
03:16 - plus 6 which is 12
03:22 - so now we have fractions and you can do
03:29 - this a couple different ways but I think
03:31 - the easiest way is to multiply your
03:33 - fraction in and reduce so for this we
03:40 - would take one one six times 12 which is
03:44 - 12 divided by 6 minus 6 times 1/6 which
03:48 - is divided by 6 is equal to 5x plus 20
03:54 - so 12 divided by 6 is 2 minus X is equal
03:59 - to 5x plus 20 so I'm gonna bring the X's
04:06 - over here and the constants over here
04:09 - I'm gonna subtract 5x from both sides
04:13 - and I get negative 6x is equal to
04:17 - subtract 2 from both sides it's equal to
04:21 - 18 divided by negative 6 and I get X is
04:27 - equal to negative 3 we have one more
04:30 - problem and we're gonna do it the same
04:32 - way 6 divided by 3 times y minus 9
04:36 - divided by 3 is equal to negative 2y
04:40 - plus 13 6 divided by 3 is 2
04:46 - 2y minus 9 divided by 3 which is 3 it
04:50 - was negative 2y plus 13 I'm gonna add 2y
04:54 - to both sides get 4y is equal to add 3
04:59 - to both sides 16 y is equal to 4 now if
05:04 - you weren't being careful and you didn't
05:06 - want your sign right here you would have
05:10 - subtracted 2y from both sides and then
05:12 - you would have ended up cancelling out
05:15 - your Y so you should always be left with
05:18 - a y if not that means you probably made
05:22 - addition mistake so you should go back
05:25 - and check that so that's all we're gonna
05:27 - do with solving equations today make
05:32 - sure here you come back when we talk
05:34 - about
05:36 - using equations to solve word problems
