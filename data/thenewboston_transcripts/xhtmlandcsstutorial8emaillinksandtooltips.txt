00:00 - alright guys welcome back to your eighth
00:02 - XHTML and CSS tutorial in this tutorial
00:05 - we're going to be finishing up talking
00:07 - about links now we need to cover two
00:09 - last things one is how to make a link to
00:12 - an email address and the second is how
00:15 - to make something called a tooltip which
00:17 - is pretty much when you hover over the
00:19 - link a box pops up showing what you know
00:22 - it can say anything you want you'll see
00:24 - when we get there but first let's learn
00:26 - how to create a link to someone's email
00:28 - address and these may be useful on the
00:31 - contact us page or you know um well
00:35 - you'll see so let's go ahead and make a
00:37 - link that says email Bucky so that's
00:40 - going to be the text on the screen so
00:43 - now what you need to do is for that href
00:46 - let's just go ahead and set that equal
00:48 - to someone's email so you might think
00:52 - that it's just as easy is writing an
00:55 - email in here like Bucky at yahoo.com
00:57 - but it's not what you need to do is
01:00 - before you write their email address you
01:03 - need to write the key word male 2 with
01:07 - the colon oops
01:08 - not mailed TP not mail toilet paper male
01:11 - 2 there you go so let's go ahead and
01:14 - save this and see what happens
01:16 - refresh and go ahead and if you click
01:19 - this then your default you know whatever
01:23 - your email program is pops up and I
01:26 - didn't set mine up yet but if it was set
01:29 - up
01:29 - then it'll you know get ready to email
01:32 - Bucky so that brings me to another point
01:35 - this is why I don't like or recommend
01:38 - linking to people's email if you want to
01:41 - give someone your email on a website
01:43 - just go ahead and write it in plain text
01:45 - then they can copy it and paste it into
01:47 - their email editor or what's the email
01:50 - program whatever because I use like
01:52 - yahoo.com you probably use like Gmail or
01:54 - something so whenever I click this link
01:56 - I don't want Outlook to pop up ever
01:58 - because I hate Outlook so anyways just
02:01 - keep that in know keep your users in
02:03 - mind whenever you're designing a web
02:04 - page but anyways
02:06 - recapping one last time whenever you
02:08 - want to create a link to an email which
02:11 - I don't recommend but anyways you need
02:13 - to write a href and as the address write
02:17 - male 2 and then their email address if
02:20 - you go ahead and just write their email
02:23 - address it won't work let's watch what
02:25 - happens
02:26 - refresh and click and it gives us a
02:29 - bunch of errors so that's why you need
02:31 - that little mail to thing in front of it
02:33 - so that is how you create a link to
02:37 - someone's email address
02:38 - simple enough even though I hate it so
02:40 - the last thing I want to cover is how to
02:42 - create one of those tooltips
02:44 - in that's this let's go ahead and create
02:48 - a basic link to Google first so a and
02:52 - let's go ahead and end it the text is
02:56 - going to be Google and the destination
02:58 - is going to H ref equals HTTP google.com
03:04 - so this is a link to Google let's go
03:07 - ahead and check it out run launch in
03:09 - Chrome when you click it it links to
03:12 - Google easy enough but what I think
03:15 - would be a good idea is when you hover
03:16 - over it a box pops up telling you you
03:19 - know maybe giving you some more
03:20 - information about Google so let's just
03:23 - go ahead and learn how to do that right
03:24 - now
03:25 - you know how I said that sometimes tags
03:28 - need something called attributes which
03:30 - give them more information about that
03:31 - tag well not only does the a tag have a
03:35 - href attribute but it also has a title
03:38 - attribute so if you take the title and
03:41 - set it equal to you know awesome search
03:47 - engine whenever we save this and refresh
03:51 - it now look what happens when we hover
03:53 - over Google it says awesome search
03:55 - engine as the tooltip so that is how you
03:58 - create a basic tooltip on again you can
04:02 - put more than one attribute inside a tag
04:04 - just make sure that they're not touching
04:06 - each other and it's the same format as
04:08 - before the attributes name and set it
04:11 - equal to whatever you want so that is
04:13 - how you create a link to Google with its
04:16 - tooltip to to to to
04:18 - tip I didn't uh you know your videos not
04:21 - skipping I actually was just stuttering
04:23 - so that is how you do that now you guys
04:25 - know basically everything you need to
04:27 - know about links so anyways thank you
04:30 - guys for watching don't forget to you
04:33 - know watch the next story because that
04:34 - isn't all there is to web design there's
04:37 - a ton more stuff we have to cover so
04:39 - anyways one last time thank you guys for
04:41 - watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
04:42 - see you guys later
