00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:05 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:07 - gonna be working more on the car program
00:09 - now as I've said before if this doesn't
00:13 - look familiar to you you may want to
00:15 - move back to the beginning to the
00:16 - beginning of the series okay so you may
00:20 - remember that we added this button right
00:22 - here that says new car that will allow
00:24 - us to add a new car to the program but
00:29 - at the moment it doesn't actually do
00:31 - anything
00:31 - we haven't even created the event for it
00:34 - so let's just go ahead and paste this
00:38 - debated right here then we'll be
00:39 - accessing that in a second so go ahead
00:42 - come over to car application right click
00:45 - and add a windows form select windows
00:50 - forms windows form and just call it new
00:52 - car vb and then add it i've already
00:55 - added it so i'm just going to click
00:57 - cancel so here's my new car dot V B this
01:02 - is the design for it now let's come over
01:05 - here to our all cars file and we'll see
01:08 - some of the information that we're going
01:10 - to need to create a new car so we're
01:14 - gonna need the color the name let's just
01:18 - leave the starting speed at 0 miles per
01:20 - hour
01:20 - the number of doors and the horsepower
01:24 - so let's just start adding stuff to our
01:28 - new car form we will add a label we'll
01:33 - set the name to label name and we will
01:39 - set the text value to name of car now
01:48 - we're going to need to do is let's add a
01:50 - text box so the user can type in a name
01:54 - for their car we'll make this a little
01:57 - bit bigger and we will set the name of
02:00 - it to text car name now I'll do this
02:05 - again for the color and some of the
02:08 - other properties of our car
02:11 - so we will do the color of the car so
02:15 - we'll just have color car and that
02:21 - stands for the name still do label color
02:25 - and we will set the text value to the
02:27 - color of car so color of car and we will
02:33 - just add a text box so that they user
02:37 - can type in their color okay
02:42 - so now let's see what else we're gonna
02:43 - need we're gonna need the number of
02:45 - doors and the horsepower so we'll just
02:51 - add a let's add a numeric up/down picker
02:55 - for this we will add a label that says
03:00 - number of doors so we'll set the text
03:04 - value to number of doors and we also
03:11 - have a name to label doors now we're
03:17 - gonna go into the properties for this
03:19 - numeric up/down picker so let's just
03:23 - call it numr and then doors and when you
03:27 - just set a max value for this so we'll
03:31 - scroll down and we will find
03:41 - the maximum value right here in our
03:44 - properties well set that max value to
03:46 - five so that they cannot exceed the
03:49 - number five so let's see what else we're
03:52 - going to need we're going to need the
03:54 - horsepower so we will just add a text
04:01 - box right here then we'll add a label so
04:06 - we'll set the label text to horsepower
04:11 - and we'll set a text box we'll set the
04:15 - name of the text box to text horse and
04:20 - then we will set the name of this one to
04:23 - label horse okay so now let's add a
04:30 - button that says okay or we'll just type
04:34 - add for that so the name will be button
04:37 - and car then we'll add another button
04:41 - that will cancel it
04:44 - so button cancel we'll make the form a
04:50 - little bit bigger okay so let's make
04:53 - these buttons a little bit bigger than
04:56 - what they are
05:15 - okay so we'll set the text of this one's
05:19 - button cancel when you switch the places
05:22 - okay
05:23 - so let's set the text of this one to
05:26 - cancel and we will set the text of this
05:32 - one to add and we'll just make this a
05:36 - little bit bigger okay so now let's go
05:41 - ahead and head back into form on DB and
05:43 - here is our create car event I'll click
05:48 - event handler so what we're gonna do is
05:52 - we're gonna create a new object of new
05:55 - car dot V B so we'll declare add new car
06:00 - as new new car so now that we have this
06:07 - form right here we've got an object of
06:09 - it let's go ahead and show it so we'll
06:13 - type add new car dot show dialog now the
06:20 - reason for using show dialog is to
06:22 - prevent the user from going back to the
06:25 - form one whatever the new car dialog is
06:28 - shown so now that we've shown the dialog
06:31 - we need to get whatever they put into
06:34 - this so to do this we're going to use
06:37 - the width keyword so we'll start off by
06:42 - typing width and now we're going to use
06:46 - we're going to create a new car object
06:49 - so with let's just say Cu from new car
06:55 - let's say let's just call it a new car
06:58 - one and then we need we first we need to
07:03 - declare a new car one so dim new car one
07:07 - as new all cars dot car so we're going
07:14 - to use with new car one then we hit
07:17 - enter and you can see it adds end with
07:18 - so basically what this does is it's the
07:21 - equivalent of typing new car one dot car
07:25 - name equals and then setting our value
07:28 - and then typing new car one color equals
07:32 - then our value by using the with keyword
07:35 - it's just gonna use new car one before
07:38 - the dot each time we call something with
07:42 - our new car one object so let's just do
07:45 - dot car name so the car name is going to
07:52 - be the value that is entered in the text
07:56 - box right here the name of the car so
07:59 - what we're going to need to do is access
08:02 - the text changed event for this so
08:04 - whenever the text change changes we're
08:06 - gonna store that in a public variable so
08:10 - public car name as string so whatever
08:17 - the text is change car name is going to
08:20 - be equal to text car name dot text
