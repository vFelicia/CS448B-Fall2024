00:01 - so our Focus today is on
00:06 - graphing and
00:10 - so this is called an ordered
00:12 - pair and it's you've got an x
00:18 - coordinate and a y
00:22 - coordinate and this is how they're
00:24 - written
00:26 - XY this point right here Z Zer is called
00:29 - the or
00:30 - origin that's where the two set of axes
00:34 - the
00:36 - X the X AIS and the y axis meet at 0
00:44 - 0
00:47 - so first we're going to do some practice
00:50 - graphing so remember this is X comma
00:54 - y so this is the x axis this is the Y
00:58 - AIS so we we're at 0x so we stay here
01:04 - and we move
01:06 - up so we're here on the on the Y AIS and
01:11 - we're going to go up three so one two
01:16 - three this is our first point the next
01:19 - one is over two we have an x coordinate
01:24 - of
01:25 - positive2 a y coordinate of
01:28 - -2 so that's our second
01:32 - point three we go over one two three up
01:39 - one and
01:42 - then1 down
01:49 - one4
01:51 - so when we write the equation of a
01:54 - horizontal line it's just y equals a
01:58 - number and for the vertical line it's x
02:02 - equals a number so we're going to write
02:05 - the equations for this for these lines
02:07 - this is line one and this is line two
02:10 - and don't forget that these lines right
02:15 - here these are just the
02:18 - axes so this is a horizontal line so
02:23 - we're going to write it with x equals
02:27 - and this number right here is whatever
02:29 - number x equals so x =
02:35 - 2 this horizontal line because it's
02:39 - horizontal it's y equals and y equals
02:44 - the
02:46 - number that y hits every time
02:54 - SO3 so the last thing we're going to
02:57 - talk about are points of intersection so
03:01 - it's where two lines
03:04 - meet it's the two places they have in
03:08 - common or it's the one place that two
03:10 - lines have in common so this is point a
03:14 - and we want to name the point using a
03:17 - ordered pair so to get to a I'm going to
03:22 - go
03:23 - to on the x axis so my x coordinate is
03:28 - two and I have to go up
03:30 - two for my y
03:33 - coordinate for B I have to go over
03:38 - two so if I have to go left this is
03:43 - -2 and up
03:49 - two and for C I have to go over
03:53 - two to the left and down
03:58 - two and and notice
04:03 - how since this is a y = a
04:08 - number the Y's were the
04:14 - same and this was x equals a number so
04:18 - for these two the X's were the
04:22 - same so that was just a quick review of
04:26 - graphing um it's going to help us for
04:29 - our next video where we're going to talk
04:31 - about the distance formula
