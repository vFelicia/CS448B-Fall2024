00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - this is a video tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston now in this video tutorial we're
00:08 - going to get to grips with the basics of
00:10 - creating a PHP file what extension we're
00:14 - going to give it and how we're going to
00:15 - set up the inside of the file to ensure
00:18 - that our web server deals with it
00:20 - correctly because PHP isn't part of our
00:23 - web server package we may need to
00:25 - specify in Apache to look out for PHP
00:30 - files and you can do this in your HTTP
00:33 - comp file that we've already looked at
00:36 - when we've set up our Apache
00:38 - installation now PHP is server-side so
00:42 - whatever you enter whatever you write in
00:45 - between PHP tags will not be no will not
00:49 - be able to be viewed by people usually
00:53 - when you create an HTML HTML document
00:56 - you'd start with your HTML tags you'd
00:59 - obviously do it it do it much more
01:01 - correctly than this we can start with
01:03 - your HTML tags you'd create your body
01:06 - tags and different information and
01:09 - different functions the functionality of
01:12 - the page will go in different places now
01:14 - in PHP it's a lot more loosely
01:16 - structured and the way we do things is
01:18 - we use PHP tags now on their own PHP
01:23 - tags look like this so you can see that
01:27 - it is a it's a mirror image of a less
01:31 - than sign first of all then a greater
01:34 - than sign at the end here in between are
01:37 - these X question marks sorry and then
01:40 - just the words PHP it can also be
01:43 - specified like this now this may look a
01:46 - bit odd to you at first however what we
01:50 - actually do is just after PHP here we
01:53 - come down and everything we want to
01:55 - write in PHP goes in here so every time
01:59 - you set up a new page and you want to
02:02 - include some level of PHP in it for
02:04 - example you can combine PHP and HTML in
02:08 - a page we could have our PHP tags here
02:12 - and we could also have our HTML tags
02:15 - down here so whenever you start up a new
02:18 - page and your going to include PHP you
02:21 - want to create a tags like that or like
02:25 - that I probably recommend the use of the
02:30 - PHP note notation at the end at the
02:32 - start so these your PHP tags PHP code
02:38 - will go inside here so how do we go
02:40 - about saving our file so it can be
02:42 - interpreted properly by our web browser
02:44 - or our web server sorry
02:46 - so we go ahead and we save the file now
02:50 - I have a folder inside my htdocs folder
02:54 - called series and this is where the
02:56 - videos or the code for the videos for
02:59 - the whole series will go I've created a
03:02 - particular folder here called first file
03:05 - so this is how we're going to access it
03:08 - in our web browser we're going to go to
03:10 - localhost series first file and then
03:15 - we're going to have our file name here
03:17 - so let's just call this document let's
03:22 - say well we'll call it in next stop PHP
03:25 - because typically an Apache installation
03:29 - will take an in depth stop PHP and index
03:32 - to HTML files as default files to be
03:35 - loaded inside a folder and by that I
03:38 - mean if your file is named anything else
03:41 - so I'm going to call this just for file
03:43 - dot PHP for now remember we're using dot
03:46 - PHP you can just to be sure
03:50 - choose all files here and enclose that
03:52 - in in double quotation marks just to
03:57 - make sure your text editor saves it with
03:59 - a correct file extension so let's say
04:02 - this we shown that we've saved this as a
04:04 - PHP document my text editor context has
04:07 - automatically turned on syntax
04:10 - highlighting for PHP this just means
04:13 - that PHP code and different different
04:16 - aspects of code will be highlighted so
04:18 - we can read things easier for example
04:21 - variables are green
04:23 - and function names are typically a gray
04:28 - color and things like keywords so for
04:31 - example for each which is a language
04:33 - construct of blue and it depends so
04:36 - strings can be prone for acceptor etc so
04:39 - we've got this file and we've saved that
04:41 - now if we come in here and refresh our
04:43 - browser you can see that the file
04:45 - appears here now if I click on this
04:48 - that's our PHP document ready to go we
04:51 - can start programming and we can start
04:53 - displaying output to the user and
04:55 - calculating and as you can see if you've
04:57 - clicked to view the page source there's
04:59 - nothing there
05:00 - so let's combine some HTML with PHP and
05:03 - see what happens and you can see now
05:06 - that by just including some HTML tags
05:09 - and refreshing the page you can see that
05:12 - these actually show up
05:14 - however our PHP code will be up here
05:17 - however it won't be shown because it's
05:20 - interpreted by our web server program
05:22 - that's where everything's sort of
05:24 - calculated and then we display the
05:25 - output that we want using PHP so it's a
05:29 - server-side scripting language as
05:31 - opposed to HTML which isn't just tags
05:33 - that are interpreted by different
05:35 - browsers ok so like I said earlier you
05:39 - can name your file and give it a
05:41 - specific file name or you can choose to
05:44 - name it index dot PHP so I'm going to
05:47 - set up some PHP tags and I'm going to
05:49 - save this as index dot PHP now this is
05:54 - in this directory if we go back so when
05:57 - i refresh in Lex dot PHP will
05:59 - automatically be opened we won't have
06:02 - this index or forward slash series
06:04 - forward such first file we won't be able
06:06 - to see the files we'll just be presented
06:09 - with the index dot PHP page and to test
06:11 - this I'm going to use a simple command
06:13 - in PHP to demonstrate this I'm going to
06:18 - say echo and this is my output
06:22 - there's a tutorial on echo and what it
06:25 - does or you'll see what it does but how
06:27 - it works and a bit more information
06:29 - about it so for now I'm just going to be
06:31 - outputting this to the screen so let's
06:34 - refresh the page you can see that we've
06:36 - automatically gone to index.php my
06:39 - browser doesn't show it up here but
06:41 - let's just type that in manually so we
06:43 - can definitely see so the page it's
06:45 - automatically gone to index dot PHP if I
06:48 - just choose to go to the file the folder
06:51 - I mean is exactly the same so these are
06:54 - different conventions of naming files if
06:56 - you name something anything else other
06:58 - than what's specified index dot PHP in
07:01 - index dot HTML I think a default
07:02 - specified in an Apache configuration
07:05 - however normal files are not named to
07:08 - open by default so that's a bit about
07:10 - naming files and how you should name and
07:13 - create your files and you've learnt also
07:16 - how to set your PHP tags up ready to
07:20 - code inside them
