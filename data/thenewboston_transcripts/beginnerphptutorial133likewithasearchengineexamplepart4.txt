00:00 - so this function here is grabbing the
00:01 - data as an associative array and we're
00:03 - putting it inside query row
00:05 - therefore inside our while statement
00:07 - what we call while loop we can echo out
00:13 - the specific data so we can echo out
00:15 - query remember we're using an eraser
00:19 - we've square brackets here now this
00:21 - corresponds to the row the field name
00:24 - that you want to show so I will just
00:26 - want to show the name so I'm just going
00:28 - to type name into here we're going to
00:32 - append a line break on the end just to
00:34 - keep things nice and neat and tidy and
00:36 - what we can do is if it is greater than
00:39 - 1 we can echo up here say results found
00:44 - and what we can also do is we can we can
00:46 - echo out the number of results found so
00:50 - where let's take this well
00:52 - I'll demonstrate the the way the program
00:54 - is working at the moment and then we can
00:56 - make that slight modification so let's
00:58 - go and refresh the page okay so I'm
01:02 - going to type in Alex and click search
01:04 - you can see that results found Alex
01:06 - Garrett and Alex Malcolm now let's
01:08 - search for Garrett and click search you
01:12 - can see that we've found everyone with
01:14 - the surname Gera now let's just type in
01:16 - Dale click search we can see we've found
01:19 - one result let's type grr again everyone
01:22 - with that let's type in a and you see
01:25 - we've received all results because every
01:28 - result has an A in it or every record
01:31 - has an A in it now we can protect
01:33 - against this you could you could for
01:35 - example say if the query string is
01:38 - smaller than a length of four which is
01:39 - what most applications do do they don't
01:42 - allow you to search for data that's
01:43 - under say our four characters because
01:45 - you'll return too many results so let's
01:47 - just go ahead and and do that so we're
01:51 - if m empty search name so inside here
01:55 - we're going to say if str len search
02:03 - name is greater than or smaller than opa
02:07 - we can say is greater than
02:09 - or equal to five or four we'll say grace
02:14 - the negative or then execute all this
02:16 - code and let's find where the one two
02:21 - closing so we'll put that there and then
02:25 - we're going to indent all of this so
02:27 - essentially what I've just done is I've
02:29 - added in another if statement saying if
02:31 - the string length of search name so
02:32 - we're using the string length function
02:33 - of search name is greater than or equal
02:35 - to four then we can run all this code
02:37 - then otherwise we echo your keyword must
02:45 - be five characters or more so now if we
02:50 - try to say Alex this is going to work
02:54 - because it is greater than or equal to
02:55 - if we would say I now and click search
02:57 - your keyword must be five characters or
02:59 - more so we're now coming into more of a
03:01 - search engine based tutorial I guess and
03:05 - there's a couple of more things we need
03:07 - to address or one more thing that we
03:08 - need to address and that is how many
03:10 - results that are found so I'm going to
03:12 - go ahead and take out this here
03:13 - and I'm going to put it into a new
03:15 - variable called query num rows so now
03:21 - what I can do is I can substitute this
03:23 - in here query num rows and we can also
03:28 - echo out here query num rows dot space
03:33 - and results found so this is going to
03:35 - say a number and this is the same number
03:38 - as well so we're using this variable
03:40 - that's why I took it out and popped it
03:41 - into this variable here and we're
03:44 - appending on a space and the results
03:47 - found so let's go ahead and type in Alex
03:50 - click search
03:51 - two results found this displaying two
03:54 - results now let's go ahead and type in
03:55 - Garret and you can see that three
03:59 - results are found in this display so
04:01 - this is the like condition in in PHP
04:05 - like I said you can use this with
04:07 - underscores to represent specific
04:08 - characters so we're filling in the
04:10 - blanks for specific characters and also
04:13 - we can use our wildcards on the left
04:14 - right hand side or on either side of our
04:18 - of our value that we're trying to match
04:20 - to so we've created a little program
04:22 - that search for names you can use this
04:24 - to search for absolutely any data you
04:26 - just need to take into account why I've
04:28 - said and represent the field names with
04:32 - the names that you want to search with
