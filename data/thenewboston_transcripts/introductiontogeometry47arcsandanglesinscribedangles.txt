00:01 - so
00:01 - staying with the topic of arcs and
00:03 - angles we're going to talk about a
00:05 - special kind of angle called an
00:07 - inscribed angle
00:09 - an inscribed angle has its vertex on the
00:11 - circle
00:13 - so this angles vertex
00:17 - is p
00:18 - and it's on the circle and its sides
00:21 - form chords of the circle
00:24 - so its other
00:26 - points
00:28 - have to form chords of the circle which
00:31 - this does
00:34 - so angle v p e intercepts v e
00:39 - this arc right here
00:42 - such that the measure
00:44 - of this angle
00:46 - is half the measure of this arc
00:50 - so if we know that the measure of angle
00:52 - vpe
00:54 - is 40 degrees
00:56 - the length of
00:58 - arc
00:59 - v e
01:01 - has to equal 80 degrees because this
01:05 - is twice the length of this or this is
01:08 - one half the length of this
01:13 - so now we're going to do an example
01:16 - so
01:17 - we know
01:19 - we have these three angles which form a
01:21 - triangle
01:23 - each one of these angles is an inscribed
01:25 - angle because its vertex is on the
01:27 - circle
01:28 - and its sides form
01:31 - chords of the circle
01:33 - so first they want the measure of arc
01:37 - j
01:38 - b
01:42 - j
01:43 - b okay
01:45 - so
01:48 - j b
01:49 - is captured by the angle
01:52 - g so that means
01:55 - that this angle is half the length of jb
02:00 - so 65 is equal to half
02:03 - the length we're just going to call this
02:05 - arc
02:07 - x
02:08 - so we're going to multiply both sides by
02:10 - 2 to find what x equals
02:13 - and x equals 130 degrees
02:16 - so the length that is 130 degrees
02:19 - now they want
02:21 - the measure
02:23 - of arc gb
02:27 - so gb
02:29 - is captured by this angle j
02:32 - so that means that this length we're
02:34 - going to call it y
02:36 - is twice the
02:38 - size of j
02:41 - or j
02:43 - which is 53 is equal to half the length
02:46 - of this which is
02:48 - y so you could set it up that way or
02:52 - you could say
02:55 - that
03:00 - or you could say that y is equal to
03:02 - times the measure of this angle which is
03:05 - 53
03:06 - either way you have to multiply by 2
03:10 - and you'll get
03:11 - 106
03:13 - for the measure of y
03:17 - so
03:19 - gb has a measure of 106 degrees
03:23 - now finally
03:24 - they want
03:26 - the measure
03:28 - of
03:29 - g j g
03:33 - so
03:34 - j g is captured by this angle x
03:40 - but we don't know the measure of angle x
03:42 - so we're going to use
03:44 - our rules of in the interior angles of a
03:47 - triangle to solve for x
03:49 - so we know that the measures of it
03:52 - of the angles of
03:53 - on the inside of a triangle has to be
03:55 - 180 so we're going to take 53
03:58 - plus sixty-five plus x and set it equal
04:02 - to a hundred and eighty
04:04 - if you add these two up you get a
04:06 - hundred and eighteen is e plus
04:09 - plus x is equal to a hundred and eighty
04:13 - if you subtract 118 over
04:17 - you'll get x is equal to 62 degrees
04:24 - so
04:25 - now that we've
04:27 - finished that
04:29 - we're done for the day but make sure you
04:31 - come back and watch the next video where
04:33 - we talk is about arcs and chords and
04:36 - their relationship to one another
