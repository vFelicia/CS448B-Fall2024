00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be working
00:07 - more on the car program now I haven't
00:11 - exactly uh think over the titles for
00:13 - these yet but if this is titled uh part
00:15 - seven for the car program then the
00:17 - inheritance and more on inheritant are
00:19 - part five and six I don't want to
00:21 - confuse you um going from part four to
00:24 - fart fart I don't want to confuse you
00:27 - going from part four to part seven
00:29 - whenin The Inheritance ones in between
00:30 - are actually part five and
00:32 - six um so let's go ahead and overload
00:36 - The Constructor for sports
00:38 - car so the default
00:41 - Constructor um for sports car is going
00:44 - to be the same as our car which is sets
00:47 - the color to Red speed to zero and the
00:48 - number of doors to
00:51 - five now what we want to do is override
00:55 - that so to do this all you have to do is
00:58 - just type sub new you don't have to use
01:00 - the overrides keyword you don't have to
01:02 - do anything all you have to do is just
01:04 - create a Constructor and it will use
01:06 - that instead of the one inherited from
01:08 - the uh what's called the parent class so
01:11 - car right here is the parent of sports
01:14 - car so what do we want to do let's go
01:17 - ahead and set the color equal to
01:23 - Red we'll set the uh let's find Doors
01:27 - number of doors it's going to be equal
01:29 - to two because because most sports cars
01:30 - have two doors and or you could count
01:33 - three for the trunk but we're just going
01:35 - to do two to simplify it so what else do
01:38 - we have in the Constructor up here we
01:40 - have the
01:42 - speed so we'll set speed equal
01:47 - to zero so now that we've used this uh
01:51 - default
01:52 - Constructor uhuh looks like we got let's
01:56 - just go ahead and
01:58 - see
02:01 - we'll just leave speed the way it is
02:03 - because it's automatically set to zero
02:05 - because car when it inherits car um it's
02:09 - got the private in
02:12 - speed and that's going to start off at
02:15 - nothing or zero so we'll just go ahead
02:17 - and minimize
02:20 - that and now let's go ahead and add some
02:23 - more to our sports car class now we'll
02:27 - just add a function that will um get the
02:31 - power to weight ratio so how we're going
02:34 - to do this is we are going to
02:39 - um use a function so we'll just
02:43 - type um get power
02:48 - to weight
02:52 - ratio and we'll just go ahead and uh
02:55 - return some well we'll create our
02:58 - function
03:02 - so we're going to call it
03:07 - public
03:09 - function get
03:12 - power to weight
03:16 - ratio and then we will make it of type
03:20 - double so now what we're going to do is
03:23 - we are going to return something so we
03:26 - will return and we're just going to
03:28 - divide the horsepower by the weight so
03:32 - we'll just convert the horsepower so C
03:35 - type and then we'll just type horsepower
03:39 - and we'll convert that to a double and
03:41 - then we'll divide that by the
03:45 - weight so we'll type weight and convert
03:48 - that to a double so when we divide
03:50 - doubles we can get a uh a decim decimal
03:55 - type so we'll go ahead and minimize that
03:59 - so now come over here and we'll just add
04:01 - one more
04:04 - button so we'll bring this down
04:10 - some we'll make it a little bit
04:13 - bigger and we will set the text value
04:16 - to power SL
04:22 - weight and then will set the name to
04:26 - button get power um
04:30 - wait so we'll go ahead and double click
04:33 - on
04:33 - this and we will group it with our
04:36 - button click events so now what we're
04:39 - going to do is um we are going to type
04:43 - uh we're going to call the get power to
04:45 - weight ratio uh function in our sports
04:50 - car class or from our sports car object
04:52 - the default sports car so we'll come
04:56 - back to
04:56 - for.vp and we will show a message box so
05:00 - message box.
05:01 - showed and now what we're going to do is
05:03 - we're going to type convert
05:05 - dot to
05:08 - string and now we're going to call
05:11 - default sports
05:14 - car dot and now we're going to use we're
05:17 - going to call the weight to um the get
05:21 - power to weight
05:22 - ratio so
05:25 - doget power to weight
05:27 - ratio and we'll just
05:30 - put p over W ratio for the
05:34 - title okay so
05:37 - now ah here we go let's take that out of
05:41 - there and put that over
05:47 - here okay so now let's go ahead and run
05:50 - our program and see what happens but
05:53 - first we need to look at what the
05:55 - horsepower is going to
05:57 - be so the horsepower by by default is
06:01 - going to be equal to let's come up
06:04 - here it's going to be equal to
06:08 - 500 uh since uh we set it in our form
06:11 - one. VB so the horsepower is equal to
06:14 - 500 so let's go ahead and run
06:17 - this and we will click power over weight
06:20 - and we get 0.5 because 500 divid 1,000
06:25 - is um 0.5 so let's just say we have a
06:28 - 275 horsepower our sports car go ahead
06:31 - and run
06:32 - this we can get the power to weight
06:34 - ratio we get
06:37 - 275 so um go ahead and add this code if
06:40 - you
06:41 - haven't and um once you're done with
06:43 - that go ahead and move on to the next
06:45 - tutorial where we're going to be talking
06:47 - about some other stuff having to do with
06:50 - um inheritance and then we're going to
06:52 - be finishing up the car application and
06:54 - then we'll be moving on to other topics
06:57 - so thanks for watching and stay tuned
06:59 - for the next tutorial
