00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're gonna be taking a
00:07 - look at creating a jQuery plug-in but a
00:10 - plug-in that we can actually go ahead
00:11 - and pass parameters do different
00:14 - parameters so I'm gonna go ahead and
00:16 - create first of all a simple plug-in
00:18 - that allows us to change the background
00:20 - color of a particular element and it
00:23 - will allow us to pass a variable with
00:26 - this no obviously the actual idea of a
00:30 - plug-in that you know can change the
00:31 - background is quite pointless but in
00:34 - this case we're just going to be looking
00:35 - at the concept of actually passing
00:37 - variables to functions so let's take a
00:41 - look at what we've included on the page
00:43 - before we start we've obviously got
00:46 - jquery i've got this file called plugin
00:48 - j/s which is where i'm going to be
00:50 - writing my plugin and then I've got ext
00:53 - dot J is where I'm going going to be
00:55 - actually making use of my plugin so
00:57 - calling my plugin so I'm gonna go ahead
01:00 - and create a P element on the page and
01:03 - I'm just gonna write just a paragraph
01:06 - inside and when we refresh we can see
01:09 - that we've just got just a paragraph so
01:11 - at the moment this is obviously just a
01:14 - paragraph in actual fact I'll go and
01:16 - change these two strong tags just so
01:20 - it's a bit easier to see so we've got
01:22 - just a paragraph here and what we want
01:24 - to do is we want to create a plug-in
01:25 - which allows us to highlight the
01:28 - background of this here with any color
01:30 - we wish so we're going to be able to
01:32 - pass a particular color to this strong
01:35 - tag or any select that we use now
01:38 - obviously inside say ext dot J s we
01:41 - could go ahead and make sure the
01:43 - document is ready
01:45 - and then we could create a function
01:46 - inside here and we could say normally
01:52 - what we would do is strong dot CSS back
01:58 - ground color and then we can provide a
02:02 - background color for example yellow and
02:05 - we'll achieve this effect here however
02:07 - what we want our plug-in to do is we
02:09 - want to our plugin to be called
02:11 - something like highlight and then we
02:14 - want to supply a color in here like
02:15 - yellow and we want that to do the same
02:18 - thing Oh in actual fact no we don't want
02:19 - it to do that we want it to be color
02:24 - yellow like that that's what we want to
02:27 - happen and then what we can do is we can
02:29 - give it multiple values as well for
02:32 - example if we wanted to change the size
02:34 - of it we could go ahead and specify the
02:36 - size as well you know like we're
02:39 - essentially learning how to use settings
02:41 - inside plugins so let's go ahead and get
02:43 - rid of that for now we want to go ahead
02:45 - and start developing our plugin that's
02:47 - going to take use of or make use of what
02:49 - I've already said so let's go ahead and
02:51 - first of all outline our plugin this is
02:55 - just function and then inside a dollar
02:57 - sign and then what we're doing is we are
02:59 - opening up in two curly brackets at the
03:03 - end of here we want to go ahead and
03:05 - write J query so this is the standard
03:07 - and correct notation for outlining a
03:10 - plugin now let's go ahead and give the
03:12 - plug-in a name so I'm gonna say dollar
03:14 - sign dot F n and then I'm gonna give my
03:16 - function a name or my plug-in the name
03:18 - and I'm gonna call that highlight so
03:21 - that is equal to a function and then
03:24 - inside of here is our plug-in code okay
03:29 - so this is the standard notation for a
03:32 - plugin obviously I've already in the
03:34 - previous tutorial talked about plugins
03:37 - in jQuery but we're doing exactly the
03:40 - same thing again but this time we're
03:42 - gonna set up some allowed settings we're
03:45 - first of all gonna do the color one and
03:46 - then we're gonna say change and have a
03:49 - setting called size or something you
03:50 - know so okay we're going to create a
03:53 - variable called settings and let's just
03:55 - bring this up down a bit
03:56 - so it's easier to see and this is going
03:59 - to be an array so the array is going to
04:01 - contain like color and then I'm gonna
04:05 - say null
04:06 - so essentially what I've done is I've
04:08 - I've created a set of settings if you
04:11 - wanted to do say more settings you could
04:12 - come down here and just bring this in
04:15 - and you could go ahead and say sighs no
04:19 - now what I always do is I always set
04:21 - these to null first of all and then
04:24 - obviously they'll be defined when we
04:26 - actually use the plug-in here so they'll
04:28 - change so I always define them as null
04:30 - just you know so I think it just looks
04:33 - better and it's it's easier to work out
04:35 - you know that you're just setting an
04:38 - array with settings rather than you know
04:40 - choosing default values however if you
04:44 - did want to go ahead and put default
04:45 - values into here you can and then if
04:48 - they're not specified by the plug-in as
04:50 - the user calls the plug-in they'll just
04:53 - revert to the original settings but for
04:55 - now I've kept it as null just because
04:57 - you know I want to keep it I want I want
04:59 - the user to actually provide me with the
05:01 - color so the next thing we want to do is
05:03 - go ahead and merge settings with with
05:06 - that if we pass through to the plug-in
05:08 - and we need to plot a pass them as
05:10 - options so we passed them as options but
05:13 - we want to merge it with settings so
05:15 - these can take effect and we can
05:17 - actually grab the values
