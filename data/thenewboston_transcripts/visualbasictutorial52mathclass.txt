00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at the math class now the
00:11 - math class is built into Visual Basic
00:13 - and it allows you to use a bunch of math
00:17 - calculations that other you would
00:20 - otherwise have to create yourself so
00:22 - let's go ahead and do a couple
00:24 - demonstrations with what the math class
00:26 - has to offer so we'll go ahead and
00:28 - create a new project we will select
00:32 - windows forms application and we will
00:35 - call it math class and go ahead and
00:38 - click OK so here's our form 1 we're
00:45 - going to go ahead and shrink it down and
00:47 - we will add two things we will add a
00:52 - list box and we'll add a couple buttons
00:58 - here
01:05 - okay so we'll go ahead and rename button
01:08 - 1 2 pi will rename button 2 2 square
01:23 - root so we'll just go ahead and type
01:26 - square root and we'll name button 3
01:33 - power so let's go ahead and change the
01:38 - name field of some of these so we'll
01:40 - type button PI button square root and
01:52 - we'll do button power and we'll just
02:00 - leave list box 1 as the same name so
02:03 - we'll go ahead and double click on form
02:05 - 1 to open up our form 1 class and now
02:09 - what we'll do is we'll create events for
02:11 - each one of these buttons just by double
02:13 - clicking on each one of them which will
02:15 - make a click event so now what we're
02:19 - going to do is for button pi click we're
02:22 - going to create a variable so we'll
02:24 - declare diameter as in integer and we'll
02:31 - set it equal to 6 and we'll go ahead and
02:36 - type this box 1 dot items
02:45 - dot add and what we're going to do is
02:49 - we're going to start by typing the
02:50 - keyword math which will let us access
02:53 - the math class and it says provides
02:55 - constants and static methods for
02:57 - trigonometry ethnic and other common
02:59 - mathematical functions so what was type
03:02 - math pi times 6 so what this is going to
03:09 - do is going to add the number in the
03:12 - list box that is pi times 6 now I'll
03:15 - take the square root so well declare num
03:19 - as integer and we'll set it equal to 64
03:24 - then we'll add we'll type list box 1 dot
03:27 - items dot add and we'll go ahead and
03:32 - type math dot square root and we'll take
03:39 - the square root of 64 and for the power
03:45 - we will go ahead and declare another
03:48 - another number so dim none as integer
03:51 - we'll set that equal to 10 and then
03:55 - we'll type list box 1 dot atoms dot add
04:00 - math dot POW and for our arguments we're
04:06 - going to have excess double and why is
04:10 - double so for our x value we're going to
04:13 - use num and we will just take num to the
04:17 - power of 2 so if we go ahead and run
04:20 - this you can see here's our form 1 and
04:25 - if we click PI we're going to get 18
04:28 - point 8 4 9 and you see it's a really
04:30 - long um decimal number and if we click
04:36 - square root we're going to get 8 because
04:38 - our number was 64 and a times a equals
04:41 - 64 and then if we click power we're
04:44 - going to get 100 which is 10 to the
04:45 - power of 2 now let's go ahead and just
04:50 - add another button here and this is just
04:52 - something I wanted to throw into this
04:54 - tutorial so we'll go ahead and add it
04:57 - there and we will set the text value to
05:01 - clear now we'll come up here and we'll
05:07 - set the name value to button clear list
05:10 - now double hit and we'll go ahead and
05:13 - double click on this and we will type
05:15 - Luke's box one dot
05:24 - items dot clear so what this is going to
05:29 - do is going to clear everything out of
05:31 - the list box so if we go ahead and run
05:33 - this we can click power square root of
05:36 - pi we can do that as many times as we
05:38 - want and then with and then if we click
05:41 - clear it will clear everything out of
05:44 - our list box and it will give us a clean
05:46 - list box to start with so go ahead and
05:50 - play around with the math class there's
05:52 - a bunch of stuff you can use in there
05:53 - such as you can use logs you can use min
05:56 - max if you're if you know trigonometry
06:00 - or anything like that then you'll be
06:05 - familiar with some of these functions or
06:08 - constants that are inside the math class
06:10 - so go ahead and play around with those
06:12 - find something that you might think is
06:14 - useful later on in a program you want to
06:16 - make and once you're done with that go
06:17 - ahead and move on to the next tutorial
