00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we are going to be
00:07 - creating a paragraph we're then going to
00:10 - be going going ahead and finding all
00:12 - strong tags or anything that's
00:15 - surrounded by strong inside of this
00:17 - paragraph or inside of our entire
00:19 - document depending on which selector we
00:21 - use and we're going to make this 120
00:23 - percent of its original size so for
00:26 - example will receive an effect a bit
00:27 - like this this is a simple paragraph
00:29 - this has been put in strong tags the
00:32 - font size is enlarged and this one here
00:34 - is in strong tags as well and that's
00:36 - been enlarged as well so we're going to
00:38 - be creating something similar to this
00:40 - although this isn't really a great use
00:42 - of find it's still to demonstrate how we
00:46 - can sort of pick out different elements
00:48 - in the tutorial in the traversing set of
00:52 - this series I use find more usefully so
00:56 - you can go ahead and look at that
00:57 - tutorial as well but for now we're just
00:59 - going to be demonstrating the
01:00 - functionality and how we might use it so
01:03 - the first thing we're going to do is go
01:04 - ahead and create a paragraph and just
01:07 - going to say this is a paragraph some
01:11 - things are bold and some are not okay so
01:16 - I'm just going to go ahead and put some
01:18 - strong tags around a few things in my
01:21 - page
01:21 - so strong and we could say bold in
01:26 - strung as well
01:29 - and maybe we could put not in strong as
01:32 - well just sort of for effect so now when
01:36 - we refresh you can see that we've got
01:37 - bold bold and bold now what I want to do
01:40 - is go ahead and make these bigger by
01:41 - using find and finding strong tags in my
01:44 - page now obviously we could go ahead and
01:47 - do this from style.css i've got style
01:49 - dot CSS included in my page already so
01:52 - for example i could specify that
01:54 - all-strong has a font size of 120% so I
01:59 - could do this straight up from my style
02:02 - dot CSS file however I could then go
02:06 - ahead and use jQuery to sort of filter
02:08 - this down and select particular elements
02:10 - on a page so we'll go ahead and get rid
02:12 - of that inside ext j/s which i've
02:15 - included on my page as well as jQuery
02:17 - we're going to go ahead and select all
02:19 - strong tags on our document or we're
02:23 - going to say we're going to say find so
02:25 - you know sort of a pretty useless idea
02:28 - of using it but you know we can go ahead
02:29 - and test it anyway so once our document
02:33 - is ready we're using the ready event
02:35 - handler once the Dom is loaded and we
02:37 - can access our elements we want to go
02:40 - ahead and select a document dot find now
02:44 - what fine is going to go and do is it's
02:46 - going to find anything on the document
02:48 - which matches this criteria so I'm going
02:50 - to go ahead and write strong and then
02:52 - going to go and say add class I could
02:54 - you know go ahead and change the CSS if
02:56 - I wanted using CSS but I'm going to go
02:59 - and add the class big inside style dot
03:02 - CSS I need to now need to create this
03:04 - big class so I'm going to go ahead and
03:06 - create it now so big and in here we're
03:10 - going to specify that the font size is
03:12 - 120 percent so what we are doing is
03:16 - inside of our whole entire document
03:19 - altogether we are saying that we're
03:21 - finding strong tags using find and we're
03:24 - adding the class big to them so you know
03:27 - obviously something you might not
03:28 - normally do when we refresh we get the
03:30 - same effect let's just go and change
03:32 - that to 1:30 refresh you can see it's
03:35 - bigger now the beauty of this is what we
03:38 - can actually do is now what we can say
03:41 - is
03:41 - P find strong so when we refresh we have
03:45 - the same effect yet anything out of this
03:48 - paragraph that is strong strong we can
03:54 - go ahead and say you know just outside
03:59 - of power graph now when we refresh you
04:05 - can see that this is bold ie strong but
04:08 - the text size hasn't been increased so
04:11 - what we've been able to do here is any
04:13 - strong tag inside of P so we found any
04:17 - strong tag inside of the any P element
04:20 - we've added the class to but we've
04:22 - ignored anything out of this bounds so
04:24 - before we were using document which
04:26 - applied to the whole document and then
04:28 - you can see that's been enlarged as well
04:30 - but this time we're using a selector and
04:33 - going ahead and finding any strong tag
04:35 - inside and then going ahead and adding
04:38 - this class on so this is a pretty
04:40 - useless example of what we would do
04:42 - although you know you could apply it to
04:44 - your page for some kind of weird text
04:45 - effect however in the tutorial on next
04:49 - nextdoor previous and previous all I
04:53 - look at the you know using a more useful
04:56 - way to use find but for now this is just
04:58 - a functionality or find and how we can
05:01 - sort of apply something to it using a
05:04 - selector and then finding a particular
05:06 - tag
