00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 46th udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this is oral I'm going
00:05 - to teach you guys how to make text
00:07 - appear on your screen sounds pretty
00:09 - basic right but check it out whenever
00:11 - you want to give your user a set of
00:12 - instructions or directions or maybe you
00:15 - just want to you know output a nice
00:16 - little message saying hey what's up what
00:18 - are you doing tonight well you want some
00:20 - text to appear on their screen so
00:22 - there's actually a little more kismet
00:24 - involved than you may think so if all
00:26 - along with this story and by the end
00:28 - you'll be a pro at making text appear on
00:30 - the screen so before I even get started
00:32 - with that part of the tutorial I want to
00:34 - tell you guys this I probably should
00:35 - tell you guys this in the last tutorial
00:37 - but typically whenever you work with
00:40 - triggers you just don't go ahead and
00:42 - right-click in to add actor add trigger
00:44 - and give a nice little big green trigger
00:47 - that the user can interact with when
00:48 - they're playing the game you typically
00:50 - don't want the user or player to see
00:53 - that in the game so you typically put
00:56 - the trigger inside a static mesh so let
00:59 - me go ahead and explain this a little
01:00 - bit better I have a static mesh right
01:02 - here that looks like a control panel and
01:05 - usually you want to have the user
01:07 - interact with something like a control
01:09 - panel or a workstation or maybe a light
01:11 - switch or something so go ahead and let
01:13 - me just drag this out right there and
01:15 - now you see this is a lot more appealing
01:18 - to the user rather than a big green
01:21 - switch on the screen so this is
01:23 - typically what you would have something
01:24 - like this now this is of course is just
01:26 - a static mesh it doesn't have any
01:28 - functionalities basically just a 3d
01:30 - model so what we would want to add is
01:33 - that trigger right next to it so go
01:35 - ahead and hit add actor add trigger and
01:41 - hello let me know reposition that move
01:45 - down a little bit and actually let me go
01:47 - ahead and change views if I move that
01:50 - right underneath there we go right now
01:55 - so as you can see what would be going on
01:59 - is behind the scenes we would have this
02:02 - trigger right next to the static mesh
02:04 - but whenever the user was playing the
02:06 - game all they would see is this static
02:08 - mesh so they would think that they were
02:10 - interacting with this 3d model but we
02:13 - would know as the game developer that
02:15 - they are indeed standing in the radius
02:17 - of the static mesh which is causing the
02:19 - program to interact because you know you
02:22 - can't really interact with static meshes
02:23 - only these triggers so go ahead and
02:26 - position your trigger somewhere around
02:28 - the static mesh and then whenever the
02:30 - user is standing right there they're
02:32 - going to be able to interact with that
02:33 - so now that we got our trigger on the
02:36 - screen again like I said I want to give
02:38 - you guys the story of how to make text
02:41 - up here on the screen so go ahead and
02:43 - like I said make sure you have your
02:44 - trigger selected and open unreal kismet
02:46 - by hitting that K button and now make
02:50 - sure your trigger selected and right
02:51 - click and hit new event using trigger
02:54 - now in the last tutorial I thought you
02:56 - guys about the touch event which pretty
02:58 - much means your player runs up and
03:00 - stands on your trigger or touches it
03:02 - well let's go ahead and use the used
03:05 - event trigger right now and what used
03:07 - means is the user or player needs to hit
03:11 - a key in order to switch that trigger so
03:15 - by default it's the e key so if the user
03:18 - goes and stands where the static meshes
03:21 - and they hit e on their keyboard then
03:24 - whatever we program this trigger do
03:26 - that's what's going to happen so let me
03:29 - go ahead and actually want to change a
03:31 - few things the first thing we want to
03:32 - change is aim to interact this means if
03:35 - you have this selected the user needs to
03:37 - be looking directly at the trigger so
03:40 - this would actually work if we position
03:42 - this trigger right inside the static
03:44 - mesh but since it's kind of you know
03:46 - underneath it and all around it we don't
03:48 - want a man in there interact and also a
03:51 - max trigger count go ahead and set this
03:53 - to zero because remember from the last
03:54 - tutorial zero means infinite so now we
03:59 - got our trigger right here so now let's
04:01 - do something cool that in order to add
04:04 - text to the screen we need to add
04:06 - something called an announcement
04:08 - and in order to do that go ahead and
04:10 - right click to the right of your event
04:12 - and hit new action and under the voice
04:15 - and announcements category you were
04:17 - going to want to hit play announcement
04:19 - now text on the screen and then
04:22 - announcement are basically the exact
04:24 - same thing so whenever that says play
04:25 - announcement we're going to give it some
04:28 - text to pop up on the screen and also
04:30 - has the option of playing a sound as
04:32 - well so the very first thing we wanted
04:34 - to do is tell the UDK all right whenever
04:37 - we use our trigger go ahead and play our
04:40 - announcement so that's what we're
04:43 - telling it to do via this wire right
04:45 - here and now you're saying all right so
04:47 - how the heck does the UDK know what text
04:49 - the make appear on the screen well let's
04:51 - go ahead and change that right now if
04:52 - you go ahead and let's take a look at
04:54 - some of these properties under
04:57 - announcement right here we have to sub
05:00 - properties the first one is the
05:02 - announcement sound and by default it has
05:04 - no sound which pretty much means text is
05:07 - going to pop up on your screen but it's
05:08 - not going to play you know any sound so
05:11 - if you're familiar with xscape or
05:13 - anything whenever you send a message to
05:15 - your friends a little blue place a nice
05:18 - little sound so let's go ahead and give
05:20 - us sound right now and the easiest way
05:22 - to do this is if we go in the content
05:24 - browser and just go ahead and deselect
05:27 - everything clear clear clear go ahead
05:31 - and look for a sound start double
05:32 - clicking all right I know you guys can't
05:35 - hear any of this but we're looking for a
05:37 - sound note wave and by the way I know
05:40 - that you guys can hear sound and that's
05:42 - because I switch from my old screen
05:44 - recorder to Camtasia again and that's
05:48 - just because I like Camtasia better so
05:50 - you know just pretend oh ah you know
05:52 - give me my voice over what sound sound
05:55 - like so go ahead and hit this green
05:57 - button and it's going to use your
05:58 - currently selected sound which kind of
06:01 - sounds like this oh that is actually a
06:04 - pretty pretty good example so now the
06:07 - announcement text is what text do you
06:10 - want to have up here on the screen and
06:12 - we're just right lucky is awesome like a
06:16 - hoss
06:17 - and now with that I'll programmed in
06:21 - we're going to go so again make sure you
06:23 - have your trigger event and then make
06:25 - sure for your play announcement that you
06:27 - have an announcement sound which is
06:29 - optional and an announcement text which
06:33 - is kind of required so now let's go
06:36 - ahead and X out of that and we'll just
06:38 - go ahead and right click and hit play
06:40 - from here so by default if we run up to
06:43 - our switch nothing happens and also it
06:47 - doesn't look as cool as it should
06:48 - because I didn't rebuild my lighting but
06:50 - for the sake of this tutorial this nice
06:52 - little black static mesh will do just
06:54 - fine so remember we're touching the
06:56 - trigger and nothing's happening and
06:58 - that's because this is a touch trigger
07:00 - anymore it's a used trigger so now let
07:02 - me go ahead and hit the e key and now as
07:06 - you can see it says Bucky is awesome
07:08 - like a hoss and I know you guys can't
07:10 - hear this but every time I hit it goes
07:18 - so yeah I'm sorry that I had to switch
07:21 - programs and you guys can't hear my
07:23 - awesome sounds but trust me they're
07:24 - there and that's how you do it so again
07:27 - um well that's basically all that I have
07:30 - to say in this story so I hope you guys
07:32 - enjoyed it I think you guys for watching
07:33 - and I'll see you guys next time
