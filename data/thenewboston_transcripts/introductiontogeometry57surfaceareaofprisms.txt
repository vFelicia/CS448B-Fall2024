00:00 - so today we're jumping ahead a little
00:02 - bit to surface area of rectangular prism
00:05 - now rectangular prism is a 3d object
00:09 - that has six sides or faces and I'm
00:14 - going to shade in the faces as we talk
00:17 - about them so opposite sides or faces
00:22 - are parallel and congruent so this face
00:26 - right here which is the top of the prism
00:28 - like the top of a box is going to be
00:31 - congruent to the bottom of the prism or
00:34 - the bottom of the box this right side
00:41 - right here is going to be congruent to
00:43 - this left side right here and this is
00:47 - going to be the hard one to see is this
00:49 - front this front of the box is congruent
00:58 - to this back of the box which you can't
01:00 - really see because I can't show you the
01:04 - back of the box on paper so to find the
01:08 - service area find find the area of each
01:15 - face and add so for a rectangular prison
01:18 - prism excuse me we can take the area of
01:24 - the top times two because that's also
01:28 - this the area of the top is equal to the
01:31 - area of the bottom plus the area of the
01:34 - right times 2 plus the area of the front
01:40 - times two now that's only for this for a
01:47 - rectangular prism when we go and talk
01:50 - about triangular prisms it's going to be
01:53 - a little bit different so let's do an
01:56 - example so find the surface area of each
02:00 - prism so first we're going to find the
02:04 - surface area the area of this front
02:10 - and this back if you can see it right
02:14 - there okay so this right here is a
02:25 - rectangle so we're going to take 9 which
02:30 - is the length times if you look at this
02:36 - one this one's 5 and since it's a
02:40 - rectangular prism this one also has to
02:43 - be five so we're going to take nine
02:48 - times five which gives us 45 for the for
02:53 - this front piece and in order to get the
02:57 - back piece as well we're going two times
03:02 - this by 2 which equals 90 so to the
03:09 - front face and the back face together
03:11 - have an area of 90 so now we're going to
03:16 - do this side right here and this left
03:21 - side right here and since those are
03:25 - congruent we're going to do the same
03:26 - thing we did with this one so we're
03:28 - going to take the area of this one which
03:30 - is four times five she'll give us 20 and
03:35 - we're going to times that by 2 to get 40
03:41 - now that takes care of both this side on
03:43 - this side so now we have one more thing
03:46 - to find the area of which is this top
03:48 - right here and this bottom right here so
03:54 - we're going to do the same thing we're
03:56 - going to take except this time it's
03:58 - going to be nine because that's this
04:00 - side of the box times 4 which is the
04:04 - width of the box so a is equal to 36 and
04:09 - we're going to multiply it by 2 to get
04:11 - the bottom and the top so and we get the
04:17 - area of that part of 72 so now we're
04:20 - going to take
04:21 - this and this and this and add them all
04:27 - together to get the surface area of the
04:31 - whole thing so 90 plus 40 plus 72 and if
04:37 - you type that into a calculator you'll
04:39 - get the surface area is equal to 202 so
04:44 - now we have one more example we're going
04:46 - to do and it's a triangular prism this
04:49 - time so we're going to have this prism
04:54 - does not have six rectangular faces
04:59 - instead it has three this one this right
05:07 - one this left one and then this bottom
05:11 - one so we're going to have three
05:15 - rectangular prisms and then to this
05:21 - front and this back that are triangular
05:26 - so each one of these prisms is going to
05:35 - be congruent because this is 5 and this
05:39 - is 5 so that and then that means this
05:43 - one is also 5 and this was also five so
05:46 - they're all going to have the same
05:47 - dimensions so we're going to take for
05:51 - the area of the rectangle we're going to
05:52 - take 5 times 5 which gives us 25 and
05:56 - we're going to multiply that by 2
05:58 - because it will give the area because
06:02 - the area across from it is going to be
06:04 - the exact same so 50 for these two for
06:07 - the bottom their area is also going to
06:09 - be 5 times 5 because we have this length
06:12 - and this width so 25 and now we need the
06:18 - area of these two triangles right here
06:22 - so they'd ruin this height for us until
06:25 - this those four millimeters so to find
06:30 - the area of this triangle we're going to
06:31 - take one half base
06:34 - x height one half of 4 is 2 2 times 6 is
06:40 - 12 we're going to multiply that by 2
06:42 - because we have two triangular faces so
06:46 - x 2 equals 24 now to get the total
06:50 - surface area we're going to take this
06:52 - Plus this Plus this and we get area is
06:57 - equal to 50 + 25 + 24 so area is equal
07:02 - to 50 plus 25 is 75 plus 24 gives us 99
07:09 - so our surface area is 99 meter squared
07:16 - now even though this is a
07:19 - three-dimensional object we're still in
07:22 - meters squared because we're we just
07:26 - want the surface area if we were finding
07:28 - volume then we'd be in meters cubed so I
07:32 - just remembered that we left units off
07:35 - of this one so we're just going to go
07:37 - back and add our units real quick so
07:39 - where was our final answer right here so
07:41 - it should have been two hundred and two
07:43 - inches squared but that's all we're
07:49 - going to do with surface area make sure
07:52 - you come back because in the next lesson
07:55 - we're finally going to get to learn how
07:57 - to do volume of
