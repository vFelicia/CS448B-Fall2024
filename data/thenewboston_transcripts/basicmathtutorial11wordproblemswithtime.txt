00:00 - this section is called figure the amount
00:02 - of time these are word problems first
00:05 - word problem says your friends that are
00:07 - riding his bike at 9:35 to get to your
00:09 - house it took them an hour and 15
00:11 - minutes what time need to get to your
00:13 - house we can figure this out in two ways
00:15 - we can look at the clock put your hand
00:18 - on the nine the hour hand and the minute
00:23 - hand on the thirty five so it took them
00:28 - an hour and fifteen minutes so we take
00:32 - the hour hand one hour goes up advances
00:34 - one to the ten and the minute hand
00:38 - advances 15 5 10 15 so they should both
00:43 - be landing on the 10 to read this it
00:46 - says 10 50 and that's your answer to do
00:57 - without the clock you can just do
01:01 - strictly math so your friend started
01:07 - writing this bike at 9:35 took them 1
01:13 - hour and 15 minutes all you have to do
01:15 - is add one to the hour it's 10 and add
01:20 - 15 to 35 5 + 5 is 10 carry the 1 3 4 5
01:27 - at 10 50 and that is your answer so a
01:36 - second where parlament says you leave
01:38 - for the grocery store 5:45 and arrive
01:40 - back home at 7:30 p.m.
01:42 - it takes you 5 minutes to drive the
01:44 - grocery store and 5 minutes back how
01:46 - long did you spend shopping at the
01:48 - grocery store you see you put your big
01:50 - hand on the 5 big hand on the 5 or the
01:57 - hour hand and the minute hand on the 45
02:07 - so that's a 5:45 you ride back home at
02:10 - 7:30 so you put the hour hand on the 7
02:15 - and the minute hand on the 30 so you see
02:21 - the hour hand advanced 2 hours and the
02:27 - minute hand went back 15 minutes 2 hours
02:36 - - 15 minutes is
02:49 - equivalent to this - this to make it
02:54 - easier to do in your head so it took
02:57 - them one hour and 60 - 15 Bravo 5 put 10
03:05 - 10 minus 5 is 5 5 minus 4 is 4 so that's
03:10 - 1 hour and 45 minutes but you also have
03:14 - to take an account the five minutes
03:15 - taking to drive there and the five
03:18 - minutes taking back so 5 + 5 is 10 so
03:20 - you subtract the 10 so it took you one
03:27 - hour and 35 minutes of shop in the
03:30 - grocery store we can do this all without
03:34 - using the clock as well let me delete
03:37 - all this real quick so what you do is
03:41 - you put down the five forty five and the
03:45 - seven thirty you subtract the five 45
03:50 - from the seven thirty
03:53 - let me just erase this real quick
04:03 - so you take 7:30 and you subtract 5 45
04:15 - but senses aren't this is the 45 is
04:19 - greater than the 30 you have to
04:22 - equivalent
04:34 - the one hour in two minutes so you are
04:36 - able to do this so every 60 minutes
04:42 - equals 1 hour so 730 is equal to 690 so
04:47 - you subtract the 45 from the 90 bring
04:53 - down the 5 8 minus 4 is 4 and 1 so it's
05:01 - actually 1 hour and 45 minutes and you
05:10 - also have to subtract the 10 minutes it
05:13 - took you to get there and back so it's 1
05:19 - hour and 35 minutes let's use a
05:24 - different example so your dad wanted to
05:31 - go to the 1210 movie it takes them 45
05:34 - minutes again
05:42 - you
