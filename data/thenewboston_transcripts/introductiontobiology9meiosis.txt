00:00 - welcome back everyone my name is Sarah
00:02 - and in this video I'm going to be
00:04 - covering meiosis meiosis is also known
00:07 - as reduction division this means the
00:10 - cell is going to go from diploid or two
00:12 - sets of chromosomes to hpid or only one
00:15 - set of chromosomes this is going to
00:17 - occur in the sex cells which are also
00:19 - known as gametes and unlike mitosis
00:23 - there are two nuclear divisions instead
00:25 - of just one you've got meiosis one which
00:28 - is the reduction phase and is 2 is the
00:31 - division
00:32 - phase during prophase one chromatin is
00:35 - going to coil to form visible
00:37 - chromosomes the nucleolus and nuclear
00:39 - membrane disappear homologous
00:41 - chromosomes pair up forming what is
00:44 - called a tetrad and these tetrads can
00:47 - wrap or synapse and something called my
00:50 - excuse me crossing over may occur
00:53 - spindle fibers are going to appear and
00:56 - if the cell has centrom these centrom
00:58 - are going to migrate two opposite ends
01:00 - of the cell here in my little drawing
01:03 - you can see that the nuclear membrane is
01:07 - disappearing you've got two
01:09 - chromosomes consisting of two chromatids
01:12 - so you've got four chromatids total and
01:15 - then during crossing over you got your
01:17 - two chromosomes here sometimes some of
01:20 - these chromatids
01:23 - can switch over they're actually going
01:26 - to break off of one and attach
01:29 - themselves to the same location on the
01:31 - other
01:32 - chromosome this is what is called a kada
01:35 - so you got one chromatid with part of
01:40 - another chromatid on it and then one
01:42 - regular chromatid in each
01:45 - chromosome during metaphase one the
01:48 - tetrads are going to move to the center
01:50 - of the cell and spinder F spindle fibers
01:53 - are going to attached to centimeters of
01:55 - each homologous pair you can see here
01:57 - you got both chromosomes here and in the
02:00 - middle of the cell and all the spindle
02:02 - fibers are
02:04 - attached during anaphase one each
02:07 - chromosome which consists of two
02:09 - chromatids is pulled away from its
02:12 - homolog but unlike mitosis in anaphase
02:17 - sister chromatids are going to remain
02:19 - attached to each
02:23 - other and you can see in the drawing you
02:26 - got each chromosome being pulled apart
02:29 - each chome consisting of the two
02:32 - chromatids and during telophase one
02:35 - chromosomes are going to consist of two
02:37 - sister chromatids but only one
02:39 - chromosome from each of the original
02:41 - pairs is on either side of the cell
02:44 - after telophase one sometimes cells go
02:46 - through a phase called interkinesis this
02:49 - may or may not happen but if it does
02:51 - there are going to be two haid nuclei
02:54 - that are going to be present and the
02:56 - chromosomes are going to uncoil but this
02:59 - this is a very very short
03:01 - phase during prophase 2 the chromosomes
03:04 - and spindle fibers are going to reappear
03:07 - and if the cell has centrioles they're
03:08 - going to migrate to either side of the
03:11 - cell during metaphase 2 spinal fibers
03:14 - are going to form and attach and the
03:16 - chromosomes are going to migrate to the
03:19 - center so unlike metaphase 1 where both
03:22 - homologous chromosomes were paired
03:25 - together everything is just going to
03:27 - line up in the center on its own
03:30 - during anaphase 2 each individual
03:32 - chromatid is going to be pulled to an
03:35 - opposite side of the cell so they're
03:37 - going to be four chromatids each from
03:42 - one side of one pair of the homologous
03:46 - chromosome so you got chromatid from
03:49 - each
03:51 - chromosome and finally during telophase
03:54 - 2 four haid nuclea are going to be
03:56 - formed each one having one of the
03:59 - original chromatids and then cyto canis
04:03 - is going to form four individual ha
