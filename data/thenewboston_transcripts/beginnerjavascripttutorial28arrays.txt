00:00 - what is going on guys is Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 28th JavaScript tutorial
00:04 - now before we continue talking about
00:07 - objects I need to talk to you guys about
00:09 - something called an array and the reason
00:11 - I need to do this is because objects use
00:15 - very often this thing called an array so
00:17 - before I start talking to you about how
00:19 - to use an array with your objects I need
00:21 - to actually teach you guys what an array
00:23 - is why it's useful how to create them
00:26 - and all that fun stuff so basically I'm
00:29 - going to put it as simple as possible an
00:31 - array is basically a way to store
00:34 - multiple values in a single variable or
00:37 - in other words a single object so before
00:39 - we had one variable and one value well
00:42 - now we can have more than one value in
00:45 - the same variable server saying all
00:47 - right Bucky that just seems confusing
00:49 - complex why on earth would you want to
00:51 - do that well believe it or not whenever
00:53 - you're working with long lists of like
00:55 - people's names or ages or maybe a long
00:58 - list of Social Security numbers it's a
01:00 - lot easier and faster to create an array
01:03 - and it's a lot more easier to manage
01:06 - whenever you're working with a long list
01:08 - there you go so let me show you guys a
01:10 - quick example of something you would
01:13 - need to create an array with so for
01:15 - example if you had to list on like a
01:17 - bunch of people's names you might do
01:19 - this far person 1 equals Bucky far
01:23 - person 2 equals Tommy and you do this
01:27 - 800 times well that's going to take 800
01:30 - lines of code and then if you had print
01:31 - them all out we'll take another 800
01:33 - lines of code and it just gets all
01:35 - jumbled so an easier way we can do this
01:38 - is to create something called an array
01:41 - and then whenever you had to list them
01:43 - all and print them out and my only take
01:45 - 10 lines of code so now you can begin
01:48 - seeing the advantages so let's go ahead
01:49 - and learn how to first create an array
01:53 - creating an array is similar to creating
01:56 - a new object in
01:58 - by that I mean you go ahead and type a
02:00 - variable and then you type the name of
02:03 - your array so let's go ahead and make an
02:05 - array with a bunch of people's names so
02:06 - I'm going to name my array people make
02:09 - sense so now what you have to do just
02:11 - like when you're creating a new instance
02:13 - a new but instead of your object name
02:16 - you go ahead and write the name over ray
02:19 - and this is built-in this is always
02:21 - going to be named array in this type of
02:23 - JavaScript we're about to create a new
02:25 - array plain and simple now as your
02:28 - parameters you go ahead and type all of
02:31 - the values you want to store in that
02:33 - people array so the first value I want
02:36 - to store is Bucky the second one is
02:39 - Tommy the third one is Sarah um the
02:45 - fourth one is Hannah with one end who
02:48 - cares and the fifth one is um
02:53 - monkey my kitty who the heck cares so
02:56 - now you can see instead of creating five
02:59 - different lines with five different
03:00 - variables and five different values
03:02 - we've made this all on one mine how easy
03:05 - and compact is that starting area saying
03:08 - all right that kind of makes sense so
03:11 - you have five different values and one
03:14 - variable it looks like so whenever I'm
03:17 - trying to use this later on like
03:19 - documents if I spell all right documents
03:23 - dots right okay bulky what how am I
03:26 - supposed to print out like the name
03:27 - Buckey or something well if I go ahead
03:29 - and type people I know that's the name
03:32 - of the array but how does it know what
03:33 - one I'm supposed to be talking about
03:35 - right here well we have an array created
03:38 - right here and whenever we want to
03:40 - access one of the values of it we have
03:43 - to add something called an array index
03:45 - now an array index is basically this
03:49 - each of these values in here is numbered
03:52 - and remember whenever you teach a kid to
03:54 - count you probably tell them to start at
03:56 - 1 1 2 3 4 5
03:59 - but with computers computers talk in all
04:03 - zeros and ones and just remember anytime
04:05 - you're working with computers computers
04:07 - learn to start counting is you
04:09 - rrrow people learn to start counting the
04:11 - 1 so this computer is going to say 0 1 2
04:15 - 3 4 so whenever you want to access this
04:19 - one it wouldn't be 3 it would be 0 1 2
04:22 - RA so now we know that each of these
04:26 - values is labeled with a number called
04:28 - in index 0 1 2 3 4 so how do we access
04:34 - that well you go ahead and you write the
04:36 - name of your array and then in between
04:38 - square brackets you write the number of
04:41 - that index so Bucky would be 0 so now if
04:45 - we go ahead and save this and print it
04:46 - out check it out
04:48 - Bucky right there so now let's go ahead
04:50 - and access like something like Hana 0 1
04:54 - 2 3 so people 3 should be Hana save that
04:59 - and print it out Hana simple enough so
05:02 - the only thing that you have to remember
05:04 - is this in order to create an array just
05:07 - go ahead and write the name of your
05:09 - array and then go ahead and write new
05:11 - array and then write as many values as
05:14 - you want inside your array and anytime
05:17 - you want to access it you just write the
05:19 - name of your array and in between square
05:21 - brackets go ahead and write that index
05:23 - and remember unlike whenever people
05:26 - count computers going to start with 1
05:28 - they start with 0 so 0 1 2 3 4 so you
05:33 - can access any of these elements by
05:35 - using the index 0 through 4 and look
05:39 - what happens whenever you try to access
05:40 - something outside like 5 it's going to
05:43 - give you something called undefined
05:44 - because your computer's not going to
05:46 - know where you're talking about so go
05:47 - ahead and save this and refresh and it
05:49 - says undefined this is pretty much
05:51 - JavaScript's way of saying you got an
05:53 - error
05:53 - you did something wrong go fix it so
05:56 - basically that is how you create an
05:57 - array and in the future tutorials I'm
06:00 - going to be showing you why these are
06:01 - useful and why it's a lot easier than
06:03 - creating just multiple variables but for
06:05 - now that's all I got for you guys so
