00:00 - all right guys let me just uh finish
00:02 - watching this Michelle Fan video real
00:05 - quick and okay let me just get rid of
00:08 - that kind of embarrassing but do you
00:10 - guys ever do that you just see a hawkero
00:12 - in the video and you just click it even
00:13 - though you know it's a dumb makeup
00:15 - tutorial I can't resist I'm a guy so you
00:17 - know blame me but anyways welcome back
00:20 - to your fourth udk tutorial and in this
00:22 - tutorial I want to talk to you guys
00:24 - about this thing right here the viewport
00:26 - toolbar uh we're probably not going to
00:29 - be covering everything in this tutorial
00:30 - but we're gonna knock a couple things
00:32 - out so basically I want to stress you
00:34 - guys that every single viewport has a
00:37 - toolbar and what this toolbar allows you
00:39 - to do is allows you kind of the
00:42 - customize your view to depending on how
00:45 - you're working with your 3D models what
00:47 - you're doing it allows you to set it up
00:49 - exactly how you want so this uh you know
00:52 - red block is nice and all but I'm gonna
00:54 - go ahead and open a map that's a little
00:56 - bit more interesting so go ahead and hit
00:59 - file open and go ahead and open vctf
01:02 - actually just open your favorite map it
01:04 - doesn't really matter what it is again
01:06 - this is a lot better than you know that
01:08 - red block
01:10 - so the very first thing I want to talk
01:12 - to you guys about is this the viewport
01:15 - options drop down menu now believe it or
01:18 - not all of these things oh I don't want
01:20 - to say all of these things about 80 of
01:22 - these options in here are just an
01:25 - alternative to these buttons so you can
01:27 - either
01:28 - they have these buttons or you can
01:30 - choose them in a drop down menu so it's
01:32 - not like totally new set of options they
01:35 - just give you different way you can
01:36 - choose it a couple things in this menu
01:39 - however are not options in our toolbar
01:42 - menu so we need to cover those the first
01:45 - thing I want to cover is the show menu
01:47 - right here
01:48 - I know you guys don't know what half
01:50 - this stuff is right now or probably all
01:52 - of it right now but whenever we're
01:55 - working in our viewport we notice all
01:57 - these little designer light bulbs and
01:59 - wireframes and lines and stuff whenever
02:02 - we learn what these things are and we
02:04 - said all right I want to see something
02:06 - but it isn't displaying in my viewport
02:09 - chances are that's because you don't
02:11 - have it selected in your show menu now
02:13 - again I know you guys don't know any of
02:15 - these things are so once recovering them
02:18 - I'm going to be covering them again in
02:19 - the upcoming tutorials but for now just
02:21 - remember in the future videos whenever
02:24 - you think you should see something and
02:26 - it's not displaying go here that's
02:28 - probably what the problem is now another
02:31 - thing again like I said I'm not going to
02:33 - be covering all this stuff like show
02:34 - volumes Sprites because that's a whole
02:37 - separate tutorial we're nowhere near
02:39 - learning that yet but one thing I do
02:42 - want to cover is this
02:43 - remember in the last tutorial I taught
02:45 - you guys about the different viewport
02:47 - types well that's just how it is set up
02:49 - by default the top left is the side the
02:51 - top right is the front top over here and
02:54 - this is the perspective but you can
02:56 - change that if you want and you can
02:58 - change it by choosing this the drop down
03:00 - menu viewport type you can change this
03:02 - to the Top If you want or you can go
03:04 - ahead and change it to the front by
03:07 - default this is perspective so that's
03:09 - how I'm going to leave it I just want to
03:11 - show you guys if you want to set up your
03:13 - viewports in a different way you have
03:15 - the option to move in that you're not
03:17 - locked in this default view right here
03:19 - so that being said that's all I really
03:22 - want to cover in this drop down menu
03:24 - again all of these things right here
03:26 - they're buttons
03:28 - that we're going to be going over in the
03:29 - upcoming tutorials and this other these
03:33 - other options right here like volumes
03:34 - layers Sprites and you know culling and
03:37 - occlusion and unlimit movement we're not
03:40 - even anywhere near that so going over it
03:42 - would just confuse you guys probably
03:44 - confuse me too well I do want to go over
03:46 - is this real time again this p is just
03:49 - the viewport type we already covered
03:51 - that the next thing is this real-time
03:53 - option now what this real-time option
03:56 - and by the way I have no idea why the
03:58 - icon is a stamp if anyone knows then
04:01 - please let me know because I think it's
04:03 - a stamp it might be something else but
04:04 - it just confuses me so I have no idea
04:07 - why it's a stamp but basically
04:09 - the real-time option is this anytime
04:12 - you're working in a viewport and you
04:15 - have either an animation or an effect it
04:18 - doesn't play that animation or effect by
04:20 - default let me go over and actually uh
04:23 - let me find an animation or effect I
04:26 - think there's a water fall somewhere
04:27 - around here here we go
04:29 - so let's go ahead and look at this
04:30 - waterfall let me go ahead and zoom out
04:32 - and check it out whenever we're working
04:35 - in this viewport the waterfall looks
04:38 - like it's freezing it's not moving at
04:40 - all even though if we were to play the
04:41 - game the waterfall would appear to be
04:43 - moving water that's because whenever
04:46 - we're just working in the viewport we
04:48 - don't really need to see that effect we
04:50 - don't need it to eat up our computer's
04:52 - memory it will take extra resources from
04:55 - our computer that we don't have to spare
04:57 - right now however we do have the option
04:59 - of watching this waterfall move and
05:02 - that's by clicking this real-time button
05:04 - so go ahead and click this real time
05:05 - button and now even though we're working
05:07 - in the viewport and we're not playing
05:09 - the game we can see these effects in
05:11 - animations begin to play so that's how
05:14 - we can you know kind of
05:16 - see effects and animation start to play
05:18 - I usually switch this off because like I
05:21 - said it does take some extra memory from
05:23 - your computer and we want to save all
05:24 - the memory we can when we're actually
05:26 - working with models
05:28 - another thing concerning this real time
05:31 - is this whenever we're working with
05:33 - objects so I know I'm not talking to you
05:35 - guys about uh these different views like
05:37 - wireframes but go ahead and switch a
05:39 - wireframe and actually just follow along
05:42 - for this tutorial
05:43 - whenever you have an object selected
05:46 - like this
05:47 - say you have this object selected well
05:50 - whenever you select it and hit home
05:52 - every viewport is going to snap to that
05:55 - object now check it out if I were to go
05:58 - ahead and move this object
06:00 - look at this and by the way I know you
06:02 - guys don't know how to move objects but
06:04 - I just want to talk to you guys about
06:06 - real time for a second whenever you go
06:08 - ahead and you move this object in one
06:11 - viewport notice all the other viewports
06:13 - notice this one up here and this one and
06:15 - this one the object isn't moving even
06:18 - though we're actually moving the object
06:20 - in our you know in our udk so you're
06:23 - saying all right even though I'm moving
06:25 - it y isn't it moving up here well again
06:29 - like I said it's the save memory but if
06:32 - you want to see it like maybe you're
06:34 - trying to position it in a certain type
06:36 - of way what you can do is you can go
06:38 - ahead and check these real time options
06:41 - right here and whenever you check these
06:43 - real-time options check it out whenever
06:45 - we move it now the object is indeed
06:48 - moving in those viewports so again in
06:51 - the future whenever we learn how to move
06:53 - models around how to rotate them and
06:55 - stuff like that if we want to move it in
06:57 - one viewport and see the actual
06:59 - difference as is happening in other
07:01 - viewports that's the option that we need
07:03 - to check that real-time option
07:05 - so again those are the two important
07:08 - aspects concerning real time one
07:10 - whenever we have real time selected all
07:12 - of our animations and effects we can see
07:15 - in real time and also whenever we're
07:18 - moving objects in one viewport they move
07:21 - also in real time in other viewports so
07:24 - again anytime you want to switch those
07:25 - off just go ahead and switch them off
07:27 - off and off and by the way the benefit
07:30 - of switching them off rather than
07:31 - leaving them on all the time is just to
07:33 - help save some of your computer's
07:35 - resources so that's all the time I have
07:37 - in this tutorial I know there are a lot
07:39 - of more buttons that we need to cover
07:40 - but for the sake of this tutorial I
07:43 - actually I have more time but I want to
07:45 - go watch some of Michelle Fan videos so
07:48 - that's the truth I'm going to watch some
07:50 - more makeup tutorials and you guys watch
07:52 - this video over and over until you're
07:54 - Pro with real time and viewports so
07:56 - thank you guys for watching and I'll see
07:58 - you guys in the next video
