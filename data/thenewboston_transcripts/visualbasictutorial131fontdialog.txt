00:06 - talking about the font dialog so what
00:10 - the font dalek dialog does is yet let
00:12 - the user select basically whatever that
00:15 - font they want whatever color font the
00:17 - size if it's bold italic and this is all
00:20 - built into Visual Basic so that you
00:22 - don't have to create your own window for
00:24 - this so we'll go ahead and create a new
00:27 - project we will just call it font dialog
00:31 - we'll go ahead and click OK and once
00:34 - that's done loading we'll come in here
00:36 - and we will add a text box and a button
00:48 - okay so we'll come over here to the tool
00:53 - box we'll open that up we'll add a
00:55 - button and a text box
01:01 - we'll make it multi-line and we'll just
01:06 - stretch it out a bit
01:07 - okay so let's set the text for a button
01:10 - for a button one to change font and we
01:16 - will set the name to button font so
01:21 - we'll just make this a little bit bigger
01:22 - so you can see everything and we'll
01:24 - double click on change font so whenever
01:27 - change font opens what we want to do is
01:30 - we want to show a font dialog that will
01:33 - let them change the font now we could do
01:37 - this by coming down here go to dialogs
01:39 - and selecting a font dialog but I want
01:42 - to show you guys a different way of
01:46 - creating one so whenever they click
01:48 - click font what we want to do is declare
01:53 - a new font dialog so dim my font as new
02:02 - font dialog
02:08 - and we just need to create a we have to
02:20 - use Windows soft forms dot font dialog
02:24 - okay so now that we've created a font
02:27 - dialog what we want to do is we want to
02:29 - show it so we'll type my font dot show
02:33 - dialog so now what we want to do is
02:37 - whatever font they selected in there
02:39 - let's go ahead and set that to the text
02:41 - box so text box one dot font it's going
02:45 - to be equal to my font dot font so let's
02:51 - go ahead and run this now you can see
02:56 - here that we have form one so we'll just
02:58 - go ahead and type some stuff in here

03:16 - start running from there okay so now you
03:23 - can see that it has created our font
03:24 - dialog let's go ahead and select
03:26 - something like most wasted

03:33 - a little bit bigger so go ahead and
03:35 - click OK you can see here that we can
03:37 - type whatever we want and it's going to
03:40 - show up in that new font now we can keep
03:43 - changing the font here to whatever we
03:45 - want so we can leave some symbols so go
