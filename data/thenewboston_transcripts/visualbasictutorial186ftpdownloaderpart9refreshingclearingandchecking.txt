00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial winner can we're
00:08 - going to continue working on the FTP
00:10 - downloader now you can see we have these
00:12 - two buttons here called load files and
00:14 - clear now I just added these so it makes
00:17 - it easy to update the list and it also
00:20 - makes it easy to clear everything from
00:21 - the list now this doesn't actually
00:23 - delete any files and you click clear
00:24 - it's just going to clear our list box so
00:28 - whenever the user clicks check for new
00:30 - files let's just go ahead and refresh
00:33 - the list so now I'll come back in here
00:38 - and whenever they cleared the list we'll
00:40 - just type list FTP files dot items dot
00:45 - clear so now if we go ahead and run this
00:50 - we can go ahead and go to the home
00:52 - directory and if we click load files it
00:55 - actually upload not uploads it updates
00:58 - the files in here and it doesn't look
01:00 - like anything's changing but it's
01:01 - actually going through and adding all
01:04 - them to the list we can also clear it
01:06 - and then when we click load files again
01:08 - it's gonna add them back in there so now
01:12 - we have one last button and it's called
01:16 - start checking for new files now this
01:19 - button yeah what we're gonna program for
01:21 - it is gonna be very useful what its
01:23 - gonna do is it's going to start a timer
01:26 - and every so often it's going to check
01:28 - for new files in the FTP server and if
01:32 - it detects that a new file is there it's
01:34 - gonna notify us of that so what we're
01:38 - gonna do is we're going to add a
01:41 - variable that we can use so we'll do
01:44 - private
01:46 - checking as you lean and we'll set that
01:50 - equal to false so this is gonna let us
01:53 - know if the if it's checking for a new
01:56 - files so let's double click on the event
01:59 - for start checking for new files and
02:02 - we'll say checking equals not checking
02:11 - okay so now that it is reversed so it
02:13 - starts out as false and when they click
02:15 - it the first time it's going to be true
02:16 - because it is it will be checking now
02:20 - so if checking then what do we want to
02:26 - do well we want to set the button text
02:31 - so button check for new files dot text
02:36 - is going to be equal to and let's see
02:38 - here start checking for new files so if
02:41 - it's checking then we wanted to say stop
02:43 - checking for new files and then after
02:48 - that
02:48 - let's do timer checking dot start now
02:54 - this is going to give us an error
02:55 - because we have not created time for
02:57 - checking yet but we're going to do that
02:58 - later on so then we'll do else if not
03:03 - checking
03:07 - if checking is equal to false by saying
03:10 - not checking that's just basically
03:12 - saying else if checking is equal to
03:14 - false then what do we want to do
03:15 - we'll set button check for new files dot
03:19 - txt is gonna be equal to start checking
03:23 - for new files and then we'll stop the
03:27 - timer so a timer checking dot stop okay
03:32 - so now all we need to do is we'll come
03:34 - over here to form one and we need to add
03:36 - a timer so this is going to be under
03:40 - your components then we'll click on
03:42 - timer to add it to the form and now we
03:45 - will set the name of timer to timer
03:48 - checking so you can set the interval of
03:53 - time or checking to whatever you want
03:54 - but I'm gonna leave mine at one
03:57 - millisecond 100 milliseconds for now
03:59 - which is a tenth of a second and this is
04:01 - going to be a good time so we'll double
04:04 - click on timer checking to open up the
04:06 - tick event for it and what we're gonna
04:08 - do is we're going to go through each
04:09 - file in the server directory and see if
04:13 - there's one that we don't already have
04:14 - so we're going to type for each and
04:17 - we'll do file in FTP downloader dot list
04:26 - directory detail
04:30 - so for each of the files in there what
04:32 - we want to do is check to see if we
04:33 - already have it so we'll do this by
04:36 - using a simple if statement so if and
04:41 - then we'll just say not list FTP files
04:46 - dot items dot contains and we want to
04:50 - see if it contains file dot file name so
04:57 - basically what this is doing if and
04:59 - let's just ignore the knot for now so if
05:02 - list FTP files that item stock contains
05:05 - file dot file name so if the file that
05:07 - is in the current iteration of this for
05:09 - each loop is already in the list box
05:14 - then we know we already have it and so
05:17 - we're using not here so if it's not
05:20 - already in there then what do we want to
05:22 - do we want to add that to the list box
05:27 - so this list FTP files dot items don't
05:30 - add and we will add file dot file name
05:37 - now we need to have a way of showing
05:40 - this to the user so that they know that
05:45 - there is a new file so let's come over
05:48 - here into form 1vb
05:50 - and we need to open our toolbox and
05:52 - let's go ahead and find a notify icon
05:58 - let's see here
06:02 - here's our notify icon and we'll just
06:05 - set this to the name of this to notify
06:09 - new file so go ahead and put this code
06:15 - in and create the notify icon and then
06:18 - in that in the next tutorial what we're
06:19 - gonna learn how to use this
