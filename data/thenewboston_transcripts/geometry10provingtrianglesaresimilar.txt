00:00 - so today we're just going to do another
00:04 - kind of proof which is proving triangles
00:08 - are similar so we're told that AC is
00:16 - congruent to 80 OD is congruent to OG
00:25 - and AC is parallel to OD so we'll just
00:35 - copy are given
00:52 - okay and that's the given so the first
00:59 - thing we can do is since these two lines
01:03 - are parallel we can get this angle
01:07 - congruent to this angle because remember
01:10 - two lines are parallel corresponding
01:13 - angles are congruent so angles see I'm
01:19 - just going to use one letter just
01:21 - because we're going to be doing a lot of
01:23 - work with angles and then it'll get
01:25 - confusing the name it with three every
01:27 - time so angle C is congruent to angle D
01:31 - so our reason is that if lines parallel
01:40 - corresponding angles are congruent okay
01:51 - so the next thing we can do is get this
01:57 - angle congruent to this angle because
02:03 - remember if two is two angled if two
02:08 - sides are congruent then their opposite
02:10 - angles are congruent and I can get this
02:16 - angle congruent to this angle so angle C
02:25 - is congruent to angle D oh no sorry
02:33 - angle sees congruent to angle t angle D
02:40 - is congruent to angle gee that's
02:46 - actually just one step
02:52 - so if sides if congruent sides opposite
03:01 - angles are also congruent okay so now if
03:07 - you look we have a bunch of equations
03:08 - and we didn't okay so now we have to do
03:21 - a really a really convoluted
03:30 - substitution and it'll take a little bit
03:32 - to understand because we're substituting
03:35 - a lot of different things in at once
03:38 - okay so if you look we know that this
03:42 - angle is congruent to this angle since
03:47 - this angle and and since D is congruent
03:53 - to G that means angle C is congruent to
03:58 - angle G because angle C is congruent to
04:02 - angle D and if d is also congruent to
04:07 - angle g that means that angle C angle D
04:11 - and angle G all have congruent measures
04:14 - or equal measures so they're all
04:16 - congruent so I can get see congruent to
04:20 - angle G by substitution and that and I
04:24 - also know that angle C is congruent to
04:28 - angle t so then i can say that angle t
04:32 - is congruent to angle g I know it work
04:36 - it's really convoluted and doesn't make
04:39 - much sense but it's completely
04:42 - mathematical there it's completely legal
04:47 - I guess to do so we're just going to put
04:51 - as there are reasons to substitution
04:58 - okay and that's actually Oh nope that's
05:04 - not our last step our last step we were
05:08 - to prove that CA T is similar to do G so
05:12 - if you remember to prove triangles are
05:14 - similar we only we only need two angles
05:17 - that are congruent so we have T is
05:20 - congruent to angle G so this angle is
05:25 - congruent to this angle and c is
05:28 - congruent to D so this one is congruent
05:34 - to this one so we have enough to say
05:38 - therefore triangle CA T similar to
05:43 - triangle do g by angle angle and that's
05:50 - our only proof we're going to do today
05:52 - but make sure you come back and we're
05:56 - going to learn how to solve the sides of
05:58 - any triangle
