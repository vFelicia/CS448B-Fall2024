00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 29th tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - going to show you guys some different
00:06 - ways to create an array the first way
00:09 - I'm going to show you guys is how to
00:11 - create an array by you basically tell it
00:13 - how many things you're going to store in
00:15 - it and then you store the things in it
00:17 - so unlike before where you do everything
00:19 - at once this is just a different way
00:21 - where you can create an array so the
00:23 - first thing that we need to do is create
00:25 - the array and tell it how many items
00:27 - we're going to store in it so I'm going
00:29 - to make an array called things and of
00:31 - course you set it equal to new array and
00:35 - instead of listing all your items in
00:37 - there what you need to do is just list a
00:40 - number so I'm going to say three this
00:42 - tells our array that we're going to
00:44 - store three items in it so now what we
00:47 - need to do is we need to treat each
00:49 - index like a variable and assign it a
00:52 - value but remember we don't start at one
00:55 - then go to two to three since we're
00:57 - storing three things in it we start with
00:59 - zero and then we go to one and then we
01:01 - go to two so even though we said we're
01:03 - going to store three things in you we
01:05 - actually never use the index of three
01:07 - just zero one and two in 0o 1 and two
01:09 - that's three things so in order to
01:12 - assign values to these
01:14 - variables
01:16 - things zero and then you just assign a
01:19 - value to this like I don't know what's
01:21 - one thing Jersey Shore looks good so now
01:25 - what we need to do is we need to do this
01:28 - two more times so just go ahead and copy
01:29 - copy
01:31 - this and just like that easy there we go
01:35 - so things zero one and two so we can
01:39 - list Jersey Shore in all of them but
01:41 - let's go ahead and list Jersey Shore um
01:44 - Brian rean that's one of my favorite
01:47 - comedians and also as a third one the
01:49 - New Boston so now what we did is this we
01:53 - created the shell of the array by
01:56 - basically saying all right we're
01:57 - creating an empty array called things
01:59 - but we're going to be storing three
02:01 - things in it so what this does is
02:03 - Javascript says all right computer set
02:05 - aside some space so when he enters the
02:08 - three things you can do it just fine so
02:11 - believe it or not you can actually make
02:13 - some code right here and then do it
02:15 - later on it doesn't have to be right
02:16 - after it but I just did it right after
02:18 - because I mean I really don't have
02:20 - anything else to code so just like
02:21 - before whenever we want to access one of
02:24 - our items in
02:25 - Array let's just go ahead and print it
02:28 - out on screen document right you do it
02:30 - just like normal um type the name of
02:33 - your array and then the index just like
02:35 - that now whenever you print it out check
02:37 - it out the new Boston so unlike before
02:41 - say you wanted to make an array and then
02:43 - you wanted to write some code and then
02:45 - you wanted to assign values to those
02:47 - indexes this is one alternative way you
02:50 - can do this and actually later on I'm
02:52 - going to be showing you um some programs
02:54 - where you need to do it this way you
02:56 - don't always have the availability to
02:59 - make an array and list all your items in
03:01 - there right as you create your array
03:04 - sometimes you have to wait to uh I don't
03:06 - know maybe the user needs to enter
03:08 - information or maybe you need to go grab
03:10 - it from a database so you can't always
03:12 - add all your information in your array
03:14 - as soon as you create it so that's why I
03:16 - needed to show you guys this now the
03:19 - last um different kind of way I guess I
03:22 - could say of making an array is it's
03:25 - pretty much the same as we did before
03:27 - but instead of adding a number where it
03:29 - says the side space we're not going to
03:31 - add any number at all and this is going
03:33 - to create an empty array an array that
03:35 - we can add items to dynamically or
03:38 - change the size as it goes on so say we
03:42 - wanted to create an array of um things
03:46 - that the user likes but the thing is we
03:49 - don't know how many things they're going
03:50 - to put so we don't know the size of the
03:52 - AR array right now and we also can't
03:54 - create an array and list all the items
03:57 - right now because like I said we don't
03:59 - know how many many things they like we
04:00 - don't know what they like so we pretty
04:02 - much just need to create the shell of an
04:04 - array so in order to do that here's what
04:06 - you do go ahead and make a variable and
04:08 - name it like stuff or something like
04:10 - that I don't know name your array
04:12 - anything you want and then of course you
04:14 - type new array but since we don't know
04:17 - how many items are going to be placed in
04:19 - this array or even what the items are
04:21 - just go ahead and add empty parenthesis
04:23 - just like that what this does is saying
04:26 - all right I'm going to create an array
04:28 - and I'm going to call it stuff
04:30 - but I'm just going to add elements as
04:32 - you tell me to add them I'm not going to
04:34 - set aside four spaces and I'm not going
04:36 - to add anything to it by default I'm
04:38 - pretty much just creating an array right
04:40 - now so later on whenever you want to use
04:42 - this array it's available to you so you
04:45 - can actually um you know maybe do some
04:47 - random coding variable x equal 9
04:51 - variable tuna
04:53 - equals um 54 or 65 - 54 and you do all
04:58 - your coding you need to and then later
05:00 - on when you say hey I actually need to
05:02 - use that array right now here's what you
05:04 - do just go ahead and take whatever index
05:07 - you need to store that value in and
05:10 - store anything you want in it like
05:12 - Baconator just like that looks pretty
05:14 - good and then you can do this as many
05:16 - times as you want so you're not limited
05:18 - to you know four spots or three spots or
05:21 - whatever you can go ahead and add your
05:24 - items dynamically as you need them so
05:26 - stuff one equals um
05:31 - old pumpkins just like that so now you
05:34 - can see this is a kind of a different
05:36 - way of making an array like I said this
05:38 - pretty much just creates an array that
05:40 - you can use later on and then of course
05:42 - whenever you need to actually use those
05:45 - indexes you can just like we have always
05:47 - before
05:49 - document. write and then just go ahead
05:53 - and type the name of your array which
05:54 - was stuff and type the index which was
05:57 - one and this should print out old
05:59 - pumpkin on the screen check it out old
06:01 - pumpkins pretty cool huh so that is how
06:05 - you create an array using the method of
06:08 - assigning space beforehand and also
06:10 - creating an empty array so now with all
06:14 - of our information we know how to create
06:15 - an array three different kinds of ways
06:18 - and you might think all right I just use
06:21 - the one whatever works for me whatever I
06:23 - think is the best well sometimes you can
06:24 - do this but other times when you're
06:26 - writing a program you need to use one
06:29 - over the other it's a lot better too so
06:31 - keep all of these in mind just don't
06:33 - remember one of them and think that you
06:35 - can forget about the other two so
06:37 - anyways that's all I have for you right
06:39 - now so thank you guys for watching don't
06:40 - forget to subscribe and I'll see you
