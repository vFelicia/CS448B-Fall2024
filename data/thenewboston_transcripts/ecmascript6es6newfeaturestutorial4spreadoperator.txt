00:00 - all righty mates welcome back and in
00:02 - this video I want to show you guys the
00:04 - spread operator now the spread operator
00:06 - is actually kind of confusing just to
00:09 - kind of explain so instead what I want
00:11 - to do is just get right into the
00:13 - examples because once you see it you're
00:16 - going to see how useful it is and kind
00:18 - of how awesome it is to so I'm just
00:20 - going to go ahead and make a function
00:21 - and this function is just going to take
00:23 - in three numbers and add them all
00:25 - together so add numbers so I'll say a b
00:29 - c which are going to be three different
00:31 - numbers and we just actually let's just
00:33 - not a even returned them which is log
00:36 - them out so a plus e plus 3 or plus c
00:41 - embarrassing all right so let's say that
00:45 - i have an array of numbers called nums
00:47 - and this is equal to i'll say 3 4 & 5
00:51 - now anytime i want to use this function
00:55 - with these array elements i mean we know
00:58 - what to do we go nums that would be 0
01:01 - and then let me do it the long way first
01:04 - 1 & 2 1 & 2 oh my god this is a pain in
01:11 - the butt already so let me run this and
01:13 - check it out we get 12 by I mean just
01:16 - looking at this there has to be an
01:18 - easier way of kind of taking all these
01:21 - and throwing them right in there I mean
01:24 - why do we have to use all this stupid
01:26 - syntax right there well before we
01:29 - couldn't we had to do it the wrong way
01:31 - the way I just did but now with es6 it
01:34 - allows us to do that using the spread
01:36 - operator so anytime we want to use a
01:38 - spread operator or in other words expand
01:40 - an expression or an array we just use
01:43 - three dots and then the name of the
01:46 - array so what this does is instead of
01:49 - treating this as an entire array it kind
01:52 - of splits it up into three parameters
01:55 - that we can throw inside a function so
01:57 - now if i refresh this you can see that
01:59 - we still get 12 let me just change this
02:02 - to something else to show you guys that
02:04 - it did indeed work 14 so isn't this
02:08 - syntax a whole lot easier I think so so
02:12 - again anytime you want
02:13 - use the spread operator just have three
02:15 - dots and then the name of the expression
02:18 - or the array that you want to spread out
02:20 - now in addition to just kind of taking
02:24 - array elements and throwing them into
02:26 - functions you can also do something like
02:28 - this so say you had an array of meats
02:32 - this of course was equal to the two best
02:36 - meats in the world which were bacon and
02:37 - ham and then you had another array
02:42 - called I know food so what you wanted to
02:46 - do is you wanted to take this array
02:48 - which consisted of apples and then Kiwi
02:52 - and then rice and you actually wanted to
02:58 - make a brand new array so you just
03:01 - actually console.log so alright so what
03:05 - I want to do is I actually want to make
03:07 - a new array or let's say that I just
03:09 - wanted to take these meats and add them
03:12 - to my food array but I wanted to add
03:14 - them right after apples so I wanted
03:17 - apples bacon ham Kiwi rice well what am
03:20 - I going to have to do I'm probably gonna
03:22 - have to like slice and then push I don't
03:25 - know let me think about this I'm
03:26 - probably going to have to iterate
03:28 - through food and then after I get to the
03:30 - zeroth element I'm going to all right
03:32 - there has to be easier way that I can
03:34 - just join these two arrays together
03:36 - right well believe it or not there is so
03:40 - anytime you want to take elements from
03:42 - one array and throw them into another
03:45 - one to pretty much make a brand-new
03:47 - array all you have to do is this
03:48 - after apples just go ahead and spread
03:52 - out meats and that's it that's all you
03:55 - need to do so what this does is it takes
03:58 - these elements and it combines them with
04:01 - these elements and then we get the
04:03 - result apples bacon ham Kiwi rice
04:08 - so how easier is this rather than you
04:11 - know iterating through and then
04:13 - iterating through this and adding each
04:16 - element and then tacking on these ones
04:18 - using a like push or something I mean
04:20 - all we have to do is pretty much spread
04:23 - it out and plop them in so that's what
04:26 - the spread operator
04:27 - is basically a way to take a JavaScript
04:29 - expression which is most of the time in
04:31 - array spread it out into individual
04:33 - elements and then we can use it however
04:35 - we'd like so the guys for watching and
04:38 - I'll see you guys next time
