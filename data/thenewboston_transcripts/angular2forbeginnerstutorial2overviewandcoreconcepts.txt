00:00 - already houses welcome back and in this
00:02 - video what I'm going to do is I'm going
00:04 - to go through each one of these
00:05 - directories and files and I'm going to
00:08 - give you guys a real brief overview of
00:09 - what they are in exactly what it does
00:12 - and then by the end of this video we're
00:15 - going to have a really solid
00:16 - understanding of what all the different
00:18 - pieces of angular 2 application are why
00:21 - they are important and just help us
00:23 - understand the basic overview of a
00:25 - simple application however before we get
00:29 - to that I want to mention one thing that
00:31 - may cause some confusion later on and
00:33 - that's this of course we're going to be
00:36 - working with angular 2 making cool web
00:38 - applications so of course we're going to
00:40 - be writing some HTML CSS and JavaScript
00:43 - however we're not going to be writing
00:46 - plain old boring JavaScript like you may
00:48 - be used to we are actually going to be
00:50 - writing a version of it called
00:52 - typescript so if you guys are like wait
00:56 - a minute you're telling me that all of
00:58 - my knowledge of JavaScript is just going
01:00 - to go out the window and I have to
01:02 - remember this whole new language just to
01:04 - work with angular 2 no it's only a
01:06 - little bit different than JavaScript
01:08 - however it does come with some really
01:11 - cool features that make it incredibly
01:12 - easy to write angular applications so as
01:15 - long as you guys are familiar with
01:17 - JavaScript or any programming language
01:19 - really you guys are going to be able to
01:20 - follow along really easy and as you
01:23 - follow along with these videos if
01:24 - there's ever anything different between
01:26 - typescript and normal JavaScript I'm
01:28 - going to point it out again it's going
01:30 - to be a piece of cake so don't worry so
01:31 - I say this because your browser and
01:36 - actually every browser in the world it
01:38 - doesn't understand typescript natively
01:41 - so your browser can only understand
01:44 - JavaScript so every time we write
01:47 - typescript what needs to happen is
01:49 - before we make our application life
01:51 - before we actually run it in a browser
01:53 - this typescript code needs to get
01:56 - converted to JavaScript so again we're
02:00 - going to be writing typescript we have
02:02 - to convert it to JavaScript and then
02:04 - this final JavaScript gets ran in the
02:07 - browser now usually people use programs
02:10 - like this one online they're actually
02:12 - called transpiler
02:13 - they're pretty much just translators but
02:15 - the way I set up our project and we're
02:18 - going to see in just a bit is I took
02:20 - care of this for you behind the scenes
02:21 - so we just need to worry about writing
02:24 - typescript and we can just write it
02:26 - normally in behind the scenes we're
02:29 - going to see that it actually gets
02:30 - converted to JavaScript and we really
02:33 - don't have to worry about it but I just
02:35 - mentioned this because we're going to
02:36 - have two folders and these files are
02:38 - going to be generated automatically and
02:39 - if you guys are like what the heck where
02:41 - did that come from that's kind of what's
02:43 - happening so again one last time we're
02:45 - going to be writing typescript behind
02:47 - the scenes the way I set it up is that
02:49 - automatically converts it all to
02:51 - JavaScript and the JavaScript files are
02:53 - what your browser is actually going to
02:55 - use so now that I said that we can hop
02:58 - back to our project and start going
03:00 - through all of these directories so this
03:03 - first one right here I'll just start
03:05 - from the top and work my way down about
03:07 - hop around a bit who knows but this app
03:09 - directory this is our main application
03:11 - that's what it stands for directory so
03:14 - 95 percent of time we're going to be
03:16 - working right in here in this file
03:19 - called TS so again this file is our type
03:23 - script file this is the code that we're
03:25 - going to be writing and behind the
03:27 - scenes there's actually a tool running
03:28 - that converts it to JavaScript so again
03:32 - never actually edit any of the files in
03:35 - here never mess with anything inside
03:37 - this directory these files get generated
03:40 - automatically so we can actually see we
03:43 - have a file called main TS which is may
03:45 - not typescript we actually look at it
03:47 - right now and it gets converted to this
03:50 - file main javascript and there's another
03:54 - file called epic component typescript
03:57 - that's what we're going to be writing it
03:58 - gets converted to epic component
04:00 - javascript alright simple enough but
04:03 - wait a minute what are these other files
04:06 - in here I mean we pretty much have a
04:08 - type script file it gets converted to
04:10 - JavaScript so what the heck are these
04:12 - map files
04:13 - well these map files are just extra
04:16 - files that basically help you debug your
04:19 - code so check this out we're going to be
04:22 - writing typescript it gets converted
04:24 - it's JavaScript that the browser is
04:26 - going to run
04:26 - so if there's ever error in here it's
04:29 - going to say um there's actually an
04:31 - error with line number 13 so we're going
04:35 - to look at our code we're gonna buy um
04:37 - yeah actually rewrote typescript and
04:40 - there isn't a line number 13 so uh can
04:44 - you help me out that's what those Matt
04:46 - files do so they basically help you
04:49 - debug so instead of telling you the
04:51 - error with a plain JavaScript file which
04:53 - is worthless to us we can map it back
04:55 - and it can say oh actually there is
04:57 - error with line number 4 or whatever
04:59 - alright moving on let me close these and
05:03 - minimize this alright so we already know
05:07 - what this directory is right here again
05:09 - never actually go in here and edit any
05:11 - of this code this is just all the
05:15 - modules that were downloaded by that npm
05:18 - tool so again don't even touch anything
05:21 - in here ever and this next one right
05:25 - here these typing's typing's are
05:28 - basically whenever we use new libraries
05:31 - normal JavaScript doesn't understand
05:34 - some of the syntax that we use by
05:35 - default so we use these Taipings file to
05:39 - pretty much say hey these definitions
05:41 - defined the new rules in that way our
05:43 - compiler or transpiler can convert other
05:47 - new JavaScript stuff to plain old
05:49 - JavaScript again inside here never even
05:52 - touch it but uh you know I just wanted
05:55 - to explain what it was real quick this
05:57 - get ignore file if you are unfamiliar
06:01 - with it then this is basically saying
06:03 - all right what files do you want to
06:04 - ignore whenever you you know are working
06:07 - with your repo so most of this code
06:09 - whenever I put it online for you guys of
06:11 - course I want you guys to have but some
06:14 - files like this like this is the
06:16 - settings file for my IDE and it says hey
06:19 - ignore the settings the people really
06:21 - don't care what font size or colors I
06:24 - use so again the non important files you
06:26 - can declare right there
06:27 - um index.html this is course the main
06:32 - index or home page for your website
06:36 - package Jason I'm sure you guys already
06:38 - know what this is
06:40 - basically um it's basic info about your
06:42 - project and also information about what
06:45 - libraries and dependencies that your
06:48 - project needs and again whenever you run
06:51 - npm install it actually looks through
06:53 - here and installs all of this and sticks
06:58 - it in your node modules pretty cool this
07:00 - readme MD this actually has nothing to
07:04 - do with angular this is just for
07:06 - whenever you go to the repo on github
07:08 - that I told you guys to go to in the
07:10 - first tutorial and you see the
07:12 - instructions at the bottom that's what
07:13 - this is so you can like I said delete it
07:15 - if you want all right so this TS config
07:19 - jason closed out of this one so these
07:23 - are pretty much details about how we
07:25 - want to convert typescript to javascript
07:28 - so a lot of these you just keep the
07:31 - default of but here i'll talk to you
07:33 - guys through one of these so you can
07:35 - kind of see what's going on
07:36 - so this out directory says alright
07:39 - whenever we are finished converting all
07:42 - this typescript to JavaScript where do
07:47 - you want me to put those final files and
07:49 - we just said well have out in the folder
07:51 - called app /j s so it looks the app
07:55 - makes a folder called j/s and puts all
07:58 - your final files right there if you
08:00 - didn't have this then what it would do
08:02 - is it would actually just put all of
08:04 - your JavaScript files in the same
08:06 - directory and then we would have all of
08:08 - our typescript files and JavaScript
08:10 - files mixed together so again just a
08:12 - bunch of basic information about how you
08:15 - want to translate typescript to
08:17 - JavaScript and this last follow right
08:20 - here typings jason this is of course
08:24 - what I was talking about earlier
08:25 - whenever we use new libraries then we
08:29 - need the rules on how plain old
08:31 - JavaScript is supposed to understand
08:33 - that new syntax so again we can define
08:36 - these rules so the compiler can
08:38 - translate that properly and this works
08:40 - hand in hand with this directory right
08:43 - here so there you go that's the basic
08:46 - overview of it but again like I said
08:47 - most of this stuff is just behind the
08:50 - scenes crap ninety-five percent of time
08:52 - we're
08:53 - be working in here app /type script and
08:57 - making a whole bunch of type script
08:58 - files to make everything work and look
09:01 - beautiful so that's what we had to look
09:03 - forward to now that we got all the
09:05 - boring crap out of the way we can start
09:07 - getting into the fun stuff actually
09:08 - creating things so thank you guys for
09:10 - watching I'll see you guys next time
