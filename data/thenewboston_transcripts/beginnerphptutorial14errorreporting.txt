00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - back with another video for the new
00:04 - Boston now in this tutorial we're going
00:06 - to be talking about error reporting and
00:08 - I'm going to be speaking a bit white
00:09 - every reporting is important during
00:11 - development and then again why it's
00:13 - important to turn it off when you're not
00:17 - developing and when you're releasing
00:18 - software or releasing code rather onto a
00:21 - public web server for public use now
00:26 - let's take a look at what error
00:28 - reporting is now if I was to create a
00:31 - PHP document and I've got my PHP tags
00:35 - here and I was to say writing some
00:40 - invalid code so what I'm going to do is
00:42 - I'm going to create a variable and I'm
00:44 - going to make this equal to Alex but I'm
00:47 - missing out the line terminator which is
00:49 - a semicolon so I'm missing that out on
00:52 - purpose now at the moment my error
00:55 - reporting is turned off so when you're
00:58 - developing you may find that your code
01:00 - will not run even if you have output
01:02 - outside of your PHP tags so let's put
01:05 - this into practice in an example I'm
01:08 - going to refresh my page now you can see
01:10 - that nothing has been returned to us no
01:13 - errors or no output at all let's in fact
01:17 - echo this here and we can demonstrate
01:21 - that we're getting no output whatsoever
01:23 - oh we are okay oh yeah okay well we are
01:26 - because it's the only line in our code
01:29 - so let's create another variable down
01:31 - here called Billy
01:33 - remember PHP works on a line by line
01:35 - basis so if you've got only one line in
01:37 - your program you're not required to use
01:40 - a semicolon but I'm going to put another
01:42 - variable in there as well and I'm going
01:44 - to refresh the page and you'll see that
01:46 - no content appears where as it did
01:48 - before so no content appears but no
01:51 - error message has been given so we need
01:53 - to turn every reporting on to our select
01:56 - value of error reporting I'll select how
02:01 - can I say settings if you like a very
02:07 - reporting and I'll explain this in a
02:09 - minute when we take a look at our PHP
02:10 - dot ini file
02:11 - now if you open up your X our PHP
02:16 - location where the PHP folder exists for
02:20 - me this is C colon backslash 4 sorry C
02:23 - colon backslash xampp backslash PHP and
02:26 - we need this file called PHP to ienai so
02:30 - I'm going to double click on this and
02:31 - open this we open it in notepad and I'm
02:33 - going to go and find on the page error
02:37 - reporting so now you can see we've come
02:41 - down to this error handling and logging
02:43 - place here we have an explanation here
02:46 - of each stage or each setting rather of
02:52 - error reporting so for example if we
02:56 - were to set error reporting to e or this
02:58 - will report all errors and warnings but
03:01 - not including East richt error
03:04 - fatal runtime errors a warning runtime
03:07 - warning so we have all these different
03:08 - types of warnings and errors that we can
03:11 - allow our user to see or or us as a
03:13 - developer to see but by default I think
03:18 - mine is actually set to zero so let's go
03:20 - down okay so we've got error reporting
03:23 - equals zero and this is Error reporting
03:25 - off altogether as we've seen in our
03:28 - browser
03:29 - we've not retrieved an error orbit not
03:31 - being returned with an error even though
03:32 - we're missing a semicolon our pages are
03:35 - working now it's also great to note that
03:37 - if we have outside content outside of
03:41 - our PHP tags this is also not going to
03:44 - going to be displayed now you may have
03:47 - come across this before where you've
03:49 - created a PHP document you've had
03:53 - outside an inside PHP comments you've
03:55 - got HTML comment up content here and
03:58 - then you've got PHP content inside here
04:00 - we are just getting a blank page up take
04:03 - a look inside your PHP 2 ini file and
04:05 - check for this check error reporting and
04:07 - I can pretty much guarantee most of the
04:09 - time it's going to equal 0 so what we
04:12 - need to do is we need to change this to
04:14 - something that's going to give us back
04:16 - an error and there's a few examples here
04:18 - but we can create our own custom if you
04:20 - like in this tutorial I'm just going to
04:22 - be dealing with e all
04:24 - so you can say eat all now bear in mind
04:27 - this doesn't equal East ricked
04:29 - so we'll have a look at that in just a
04:31 - moment so we've got eat all here now
04:35 - let's go and say go ahead and save this
04:37 - so save what we need to do now is we
04:39 - need to restart our Pachi server so we
04:42 - come into our exam control panel click
04:44 - stop and click start this may be
04:46 - slightly different for you you might be
04:47 - using another package installation now
04:52 - what we can do is we can open up our
04:53 - browser and click refresh and you can
04:57 - see that it's giving us our error back
04:59 - so we're saying here pass error
05:01 - expecting a comma or expecting a
05:04 - semicolon on line 4 so what we can do
05:07 - now is go over to line 4 and you might
05:10 - think well I've got a semicolon on line
05:12 - 4 but in actual fact it's referring to
05:15 - the end of this line meaning it's
05:17 - expected either here or in terms of
05:21 - reading it it's expected here so when we
05:24 - fix this and we refresh you can see that
05:28 - it's working fine so we've got our
05:30 - outside content and our inside content
