00:00 - the number of spaces or points you can
00:03 - move is dictated by however whatever
00:07 - numbers on these dice so for example if
00:09 - you say you roll a one you can take hey
00:12 - now get over here you can take a checker
00:15 - and move it one space remember you
00:18 - always move in the same direction from
00:19 - high to low so if you roll let me roll
00:22 - something else a six you can take this
00:25 - Checker and move it 1 2 3 4 5 six space
00:30 - so again like I said um the number on
00:34 - the dice dictates how many spaces you
00:36 - can move so here is how we start the
00:39 - game as you can see since you're Brown
00:42 - you have two brown dice go ahead and put
00:44 - one in your Shaker since I'm white I
00:48 - have two white dice I'm going to go
00:49 - ahead and put one in my shaker now
00:52 - pretend that this is your hand and this
00:54 - is my hand both players are going to
00:56 - roll at the same time now since I have a
01:01 - two and you have a one I don't know if
01:03 - you can see that but I rolled a two and
01:05 - you rolled a one since I was higher that
01:08 - means I go first now if we tied and we
01:11 - both rolled let's see where's it two if
01:13 - we both rolled a two then what we would
01:15 - do is we just put them in the Shaker
01:17 - again and we would keep rolling until
01:19 - one of us got higher but since I got a
01:21 - two that time and you got a one if I can
01:25 - find it there we go here's what I'm
01:27 - going to do to start out I'm going to
01:29 - move one of my Checkers two spots and
01:32 - one of them one spot so let's go ahead
01:35 - and let me think of a good play I'm
01:38 - going to go ahead and move this one too
01:40 - one two and I'm going to go ahead and
01:43 - move this one one remember I'm going to
01:46 - be moving all my Checkers like this and
01:48 - you're going to be moving them all like
01:50 - this so now my turn is over I'm going to
01:53 - pick up my dice put it back in my dice
01:55 - cup now you pick up your dice and put it
01:59 - in your dice cup cup and since I'm done
02:01 - it's your turn so now put your dice in
02:03 - your dice cup and roll on the right side
02:07 - of the board now check this here's some
02:08 - little rules about rolling first of all
02:11 - your dice have to come from a dice
02:13 - Shaker you can't throw them from your
02:15 - hand or anything like that another thing
02:17 - is both dice have to come out if you
02:20 - roll and only one dice comes out of the
02:22 - Shaker it's invalid you have to roll the
02:24 - game and the last thing they have to be
02:27 - on the right hand side of your board
02:28 - they can't go off the board or anything
02:30 - like
02:32 - this and the last rule I want to tell
02:35 - you they can't be cocked on like any
02:38 - chip or they can't be cocked up against
02:40 - the side of the board or they can't land
02:42 - on any chips like that they both have to
02:44 - land on the felt if any of these rules
02:47 - are broken um you're going to have to
02:49 - roll again and again these are the
02:51 - strict backend rules it's like um you
02:54 - know not only commment courtesy but if
02:57 - you're playing in a tournament and you
02:58 - try to get away with a roll like this
03:01 - then they probably beat the crap out of
03:02 - you so anyways make sure you're using
03:05 - proper rolling techniques so let's go
03:07 - ahead and put your dice in your dice
03:08 - Shaker and let's see what you
03:10 - get you got a three and a two so here's
03:14 - what this means you can move one Checker
03:16 - three and one Checker two or you can
03:19 - combine one Checker and move a total of
03:22 - five spaces so let's go ahead and take a
03:23 - look at some options go ahead and move
03:25 - this Checker 1 2
03:27 - 3 and this one one two you could do that
03:31 - for example or what you could do is move
03:34 - this Checker five spaces so 1 2 3 and
03:38 - your two would be one
03:40 - two so check that out those are your
03:43 - different options so I'm going to go
03:44 - ahead and leave you with that second
03:46 - option right there moving one Checker
03:48 - five spaces now the only thing I want to
03:51 - point out before I let you guys go for
03:53 - this tutorial is one thing that you
03:55 - can't
03:57 - do one thing that you can't do is is you
04:00 - can't land on a space where I have two
04:02 - or more Checkers so for example you
04:04 - can't take this Checker right here and
04:06 - move one 2 3 1 2 my Checkers are already
04:12 - there so you can't land on my space so I
04:15 - set up kind of a block for you right
04:17 - here so if you you know if you were
04:20 - thinking about landing on a space like
04:22 - this or landing on a space like this
04:25 - it's invalid you can't do that so let's
04:27 - go ahead and play your 1 2 3 one two
04:30 - right now and now your turn is over so
04:33 - go ahead pick up your dice and put your
04:35 - dice in your roller right there and
04:37 - until you put your dice in your roller
04:39 - you can take back any move but as soon
04:41 - as you put your dice in your roller
04:43 - that's like saying that's my end of my
04:45 - turn I pass so now let's go ahead and
04:49 - we'll give me one more roll before I let
04:51 - you guys go so now again since you just
04:54 - went it's my turn I got a four and a
04:58 - three so here's what I'm going to going
04:59 - to do let's go ahead and move this one 1
05:02 - 2 3 4 just like that and I'm going to
05:06 - move this one one 2 3 just like that now
05:11 - I'm done with my turn go ahead grab my
05:14 - dice put it in my shaker and now it
05:18 - would be your turn so now we learn the
05:20 - basics of back am and how to set up the
