00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new boston
00:05 - now we've already looked at an
00:07 - introduction to jQuery plugins we're
00:10 - going to go ahead and install this
00:11 - particular plug-in called show password
00:14 - now what this does looking at the
00:17 - description I've already tested this
00:19 - plugging and it's working perfectly is
00:21 - it adds a customizable show password
00:23 - checkbox so a checkbox next to the input
00:26 - field password and it allows your you or
00:29 - the users to view their password as
00:32 - they're typing it so you can check this
00:34 - button and your password will can move
00:35 - will be converted or shown as opposed to
00:39 - the original asterisks is or or circles
00:43 - that are shown in most browsers so I've
00:47 - come over to plugins jQuery comm slash
00:49 - project slash show password so if you
00:52 - want to follow along this tutorial of
00:54 - installing this plug-in then go ahead to
00:57 - that address now and follow along the
01:00 - links like click now there's no reserve
01:02 - there's no releases actually uploaded
01:04 - onto the onto this jQuery page but we
01:08 - have a resources section here when we
01:09 - where we can go over to the home page of
01:12 - this or the author the plug-in of this
01:14 - author or the author of this plug-in
01:16 - rather so when we go down we get some
01:19 - more description about it we can view a
01:21 - demo and also download this as well
01:23 - so let's go ahead and first of all view
01:25 - a demo that's quite important so we know
01:27 - how it functions and how it should
01:29 - function you can see that we've been
01:31 - giving a usage snippet just here and
01:34 - just further down this some more options
01:37 - that we can give it we're good we're
01:39 - just going to be focusing on installing
01:41 - the plug-in and the best ways to do this
01:43 - so let's say I was to go ahead and type
01:45 - a password just in here the show
01:49 - password checkbox I can now click and
01:52 - the text will be shown inside of here
01:54 - when I click this again the text will be
01:57 - converted back to a secret password so
02:00 - more and more nowadays these these are
02:03 - cropping up to show you the password as
02:05 - you're typing it particularly for
02:07 - example if you're entering a web key
02:10 - or a connecting to a Rooter wireless
02:14 - network they usually have some kind of
02:16 - show password option so perhaps if
02:18 - you're entering some kind of long but
02:20 - secret data you might want to just show
02:23 - this so you can see a you know as long
02:25 - as no one's around you and that might be
02:27 - useful when actually typing it in
02:29 - depending on how complicated it is so
02:32 - let's go back to the author's homepage
02:34 - and let's go ahead and just click
02:36 - download and receive this zip file as a
02:38 - download so we've got this zip file here
02:41 - which we can open and inside we've got
02:44 - three files now index dot PHP
02:46 - automatically shows me that this could
02:48 - be a demo file and it is in fact a demo
02:52 - file
02:52 - so most plugins are going to come with
02:54 - these files where they have a page setup
02:56 - ready for you to use we've also got a
02:59 - jQuery password is and jQuery show
03:03 - password minge is and the majority of
03:06 - plugins will have the jQuery notation on
03:10 - the front of them and then there's the
03:12 - plug-in name and then obviously it'll be
03:14 - a JavaScript file now the one that we
03:16 - want to go for is the minified version
03:18 - as with jQuery a lot of plugins do come
03:21 - with minified and uncompressed versions
03:24 - you can see the size difference just
03:27 - here this one's 1.7 megabytes and this
03:29 - one's to this week kilobyte yeah sorry
03:32 - this is kilobytes and then 2.1 so we're
03:35 - looking at a much smaller package if you
03:39 - wanted to go ahead and modify a plug-in
03:41 - for any reason and the author has
03:43 - provided you with an uncompressed
03:44 - version you can go ahead and use this
03:46 - one but it's always best to or use a
03:49 - minified version of of a plug-in or
03:51 - jQuery just to keep page load time down
03:54 - or to a minimum so at the moment on my
03:58 - page I just have a stylesheet included
04:00 - which isn't relevant in this case but
04:02 - the main thing to look out for is we
04:04 - have this jQuery is so we have jQuery
04:06 - included jQuery plugins require jQuery
04:10 - so you're going to need to make sure
04:11 - you've included jQuery before you
04:13 - include the plug-in files now what I'm
04:16 - going to do is I'm just going to open up
04:17 - my directory my
04:19 - directory and go over to the JavaScript
04:21 - folder I'm then essentially going to
04:24 - either copy this over to this JavaScript
04:27 - folder JavaScript folders just where I
04:29 - keep all my plugins or my jQuery just to
04:31 - keep them neat but what I'm gonna do is
04:34 - I'm gonna cancel that and I'm gonna
04:35 - double click on this to open it up in my
04:38 - text editor so I'm gonna go ahead and
04:40 - copy this entirely select it all and
04:42 - copy it entirely I'm gonna close this
04:45 - off and I'm gonna open up a new document
04:46 - and I'm gonna go ahead and save this as
04:49 - jQuery show password is now the reason I
04:55 - tend to do this rather than just copying
04:57 - files is so I can give them my own names
05:00 - I like to keep filenames neat and tidy
05:03 - and to a certain structure so I've used
05:06 - jQuery
05:07 - - show password is the same as jQuery UI
05:11 - here I've named jQuery UI so we've now
05:15 - saving out this file ensuring that it is
05:18 - a JavaScript extension now that we've
05:20 - saved that out it's ready to use so we
05:22 - can go ahead and close that now what we
05:24 - want to do is the footer of our page we
05:27 - want to go ahead and include this as
05:29 - well as jQuery so I'm gonna type script
05:31 - type equals and then just end the script
05:34 - there and the type is obviously text
05:38 - forward slash JavaScript and the source
05:40 - we're going to go ahead and supply so
05:42 - that's J s forward slash jQuery show
05:45 - password is so now that I've saved that
05:49 - out if we come over to my page here and
05:51 - refresh that should now be included as
05:55 - long as I've spelt this right and the
05:57 - file actually exists it'll be included
05:59 - in the page now as with all jQuery or
06:03 - JavaScript we'll want to keep all of our
06:05 - code in an external file so I'm going to
06:08 - go ahead and create a new file and save
06:09 - this in the J's folder as well and this
06:12 - is just going to be called password is
