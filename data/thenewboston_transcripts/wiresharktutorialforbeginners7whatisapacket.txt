00:00 - all right guys so in this video what I
00:03 - want to do is I want to give you guys a
00:05 - very and I emphasize very basic overview
00:09 - of a packet in the different parts that
00:11 - it's broken into and well just exactly
00:13 - what it is so for this example go ahead
00:16 - and open that file that you downloaded
00:18 - in the first video so
00:21 - HTTP and boom there you go so select
00:25 - packet number four and we can see
00:28 - already that this is a get request now
00:30 - I'm guessing that you guys are already a
00:32 - little bit familiar with get requests
00:34 - basically whenever you want a web page
00:36 - from you know some uh server like
00:38 - Facebook or something then you're going
00:40 - to send that server a G request and that
00:42 - server hopefully if everything works
00:44 - correctly it's going to send you back
00:46 - some HTML file and it doesn't have to be
00:49 - HTML file it could be like a picture
00:51 - whatever so we're just going to get
00:53 - something from a server now whenever
00:56 - you're trying to look at a packet to be
00:58 - honest the way I think about it is it's
01:00 - really easy to understand if you think
01:02 - of it just like a package like you're
01:03 - sending someone a package in the mail so
01:06 - whenever you send them a package then
01:08 - what you do is you know you just don't
01:10 - send them an empty box you need the
01:11 - address on it and you put your return
01:13 - address in you know you put some stuff
01:15 - inside the package unless you do want to
01:17 - send my empty box for some reason but
01:20 - that's basically how packets work with
01:22 - computers as well whenever you look at a
01:25 - packet what it basically is is it's a
01:28 - package of information information that
01:30 - you're going to send to another computer
01:32 - so this packet right here is just a
01:35 - package that we're sending to some other
01:37 - server and inside the package it's
01:39 - pretty much saying hey give me a file so
01:43 - we're going to start at the bottom right
01:45 - here and let me minimize this and
01:48 - maximize that and spread it all out all
01:50 - right so it all starts with HTTP and
01:54 - this is pretty much the protocol saying
01:56 - this is the type of data that you're
01:58 - going to be sending and this is how it's
02:01 - going to be formatted so whenever the
02:03 - server gets this and sees that it's HTTP
02:06 - that usually means okay so they're
02:08 - looking for some web file maybe a
02:10 - picture maybe um you know just HTML file
02:13 - whatever now there are rules that
02:16 - whenever we send an HTTP packet that it
02:19 - needs to be formatted in a specific kind
02:21 - of way so the server is going to look
02:24 - through things like request URI request
02:26 - method and it basically like I said
02:30 - these are the rules of how the data is
02:32 - formatted and what type of data it is
02:35 - now we also need to include basic TCP
02:39 - information now TCP this is the protocol
02:42 - and again like I said this is a really
02:44 - basic overview but these are the rules
02:46 - on how we are going to connect to that
02:50 - server now inside here there's some real
02:53 - basic information like the ports that
02:55 - we're going to be using and we're going
02:57 - to be taking a closer look at TCP
02:59 - specifically the handshake or the
03:01 - process of exactly how they're connected
03:04 - in probably the next tutorial but just
03:06 - remember this is what type of data it is
03:09 - and how it's formatted and these are the
03:11 - rules and on how we're going to be
03:13 - connected now we're also going to
03:15 - include ipv4 since we're using version 4
03:18 - IP addresses and this is the destination
03:21 - and return address information so we'll
03:24 - see okay what is the IP address of the
03:27 - server we want to connect to and
03:29 - whenever it's sends information back we
03:31 - need to give them their IP so it can
03:33 - actually send it to the you know our
03:35 - back to our computer now this ethernet
03:39 - section right here whenever your message
03:41 - is all packaged up and ready to be sent
03:44 - you just don't send it directly to that
03:46 - server because you know you don't have a
03:48 - big ethernet cable connected to Facebook
03:50 - server so you need to send it to your
03:53 - router and then your router sends it to
03:55 - I don't know maybe another router and
03:56 - then through internet magic it it
03:58 - eventually gets there so whenever you
04:00 - send it to your router you need your
04:02 - router's Mac address now whenever it
04:06 - goes to Facebook and comes back it's
04:07 - going to go through your router so that
04:09 - way whenever the data gets to your
04:11 - router if a bunch of different computers
04:13 - are connected to it then your computer's
04:15 - be like hey over here that that's uh for
04:17 - me so basically
04:20 - this is the information to connect your
04:22 - computer to your router and it uses Mac
04:26 - addressing and frames
04:29 - this is basically uh the point where the
04:32 - software becomes real because this
04:36 - software that's on your computer right
04:37 - now you can't touch it you can't hold it
04:39 - in your hand it's just you know a
04:42 - program however what is eventually going
04:45 - to happen is the software all these ones
04:47 - and zeros that somehow magically become
04:49 - a pitcher they need to be converted into
04:53 - either you know like a uh if you're
04:55 - transferring it over ethernet a bit of
04:57 - electricity if you're transferring over
05:00 - fiber optics then little pulses of light
05:03 - if you're using Wi-Fi then it's going to
05:04 - convert it into radio waves now these
05:08 - frames in this framing information is it
05:12 - includes a bunch of Hardware information
05:14 - like the Mac header and the trailer and
05:16 - it also includes ethernet info but
05:19 - basically this helps software become um
05:24 - real so data that can actually be
05:27 - transmitted now we can actually see that
05:29 - data
05:30 - so for example if we see this see this
05:34 - is bytes on a wire so whenever we
05:37 - transfer over a wire an Ethernet cable
05:40 - what's going to happen is it's going to
05:41 - send a pulse of electricity every time
05:43 - you see one and it's going to hold off
05:45 - or not send one whenever you see a zero
05:50 - so kind of like a weird Morse cat so
05:53 - again fiber optics you would use light
05:55 - Wi-Fi these would be radio waves and
05:58 - Wi-Fi protocol is you know a whole
06:00 - different Beast it's complex but that's
06:02 - the like I said real basic overview of
06:07 - how how you pretty much look up memes on
06:09 - the internet this is what's happening in
06:11 - behind the scenes now the cool thing is
06:14 - once this gets to the destination and
06:16 - once all these electrical signals get to
06:19 - like a server um I don't know like
06:21 - Instagram server then the first thing
06:23 - it's going to do is it's going to be
06:25 - accepting all of these electronic
06:27 - signals and then it's going to go
06:29 - through and says oh we got some data and
06:32 - then it's going to go backwards even
06:33 - more oh we got some HTTP data oh they
06:38 - requested this file and this is how I'm
06:41 - supposed to send it back so that's what
06:44 - we're going to do and we're going to
06:46 - package it up in this kind of way and
06:48 - whenever the server gets that package
06:50 - it's going to unwrap it bit by bit and
06:52 - eventually see the message inside and
06:54 - the message says hey yo I want this than
06:57 - meme send it back so so like I said it's
07:00 - a very basic overview of what happened
07:02 - so hopefully you guys understand these
07:04 - sections a little bit more clearly and
07:07 - uh you know a lot more to cover but
07:09 - there you go thank you guys for watching
07:11 - next video TCP handshake is going to be
07:13 - awesome
