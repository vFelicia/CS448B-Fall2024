00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - installing a plug-in and using it on our
00:09 - page here where we have a paragraph of
00:12 - text now what we're going to be doing is
00:15 - we're going to be installing this
00:16 - particular plug-in here found at this
00:18 - web address just here so if you want to
00:20 - go ahead and just go ahead and type this
00:23 - into your browser you can come on you'll
00:26 - obviously come on to the page and we'll
00:27 - look at downloading it and installing on
00:30 - here and the first we're going to be
00:32 - looking at it in terms of sending a
00:35 - variable to the particular page for
00:38 - example at the moment we're on index dot
00:39 - PHP and we're going to be highlighting a
00:42 - particular word so for example search
00:45 - and the first thing that this will do is
00:47 - it will it will highlight any keywords
00:51 - with the other word any words on the
00:53 - page with the search term search so this
00:57 - word here will be searched will be
00:59 - highlighted for example if we would
01:01 - change this to a for example every
01:04 - letter in here with a would be
01:06 - highlighted just here so let's go ahead
01:09 - and first of all look at how we're going
01:10 - to install this plug-in and then we'll
01:12 - go ahead and actually create this in
01:14 - this way we're then going to be creating
01:16 - a more dynamic search on our page using
01:19 - jQuery to actually search so we're first
01:21 - of all going to be using a form that
01:23 - will submit this get variable and then
01:26 - secondly we'll look at actually
01:27 - installing it with a button and an event
01:29 - handler so like I said if you go over to
01:32 - this page we can come down here you can
01:35 - see a demo of this but we'll skip that
01:37 - just for now and you can download this
01:39 - file here jQuery highlight is so I'm
01:42 - going to go ahead and click on that and
01:44 - this just gives me the code for this
01:45 - plug-in so what I'm going to do is I'm
01:47 - going to go ahead and copy that and open
01:50 - up my text browser sorry my text editor
01:52 - you can see I've got ext dot J s which
01:55 - is already included in my page and I've
01:58 - got style dot CSS which is included as a
02:00 - stylesheet up here we're going to be
02:03 - creating our form just here
02:05 - but first of all we want to go ahead and
02:07 - create a file for this plugin and also
02:10 - then include that on the page so the
02:12 - first thing we want to do is create a
02:13 - new document and just paste the contents
02:15 - of this plug-in in we want to go ahead
02:17 - and save that in our J's folder and I'm
02:20 - just going to save this as highlight j/s
02:22 - so now I've saved this file we can
02:25 - confidently go ahead and just close that
02:27 - off now but now we need to go ahead and
02:29 - include it on our page now ext look j/s
02:32 - is where we're going to handle our
02:33 - jQuery and so we're going to do that in
02:36 - just a moment
02:37 - however we need to go ahead and include
02:40 - this and include this plug-in first so
02:45 - let's go ahead and say script type
02:47 - equals and we'll just close our script
02:50 - tag off there it's a text JavaScript
02:53 - type so text JavaScript and the source
02:56 - we just need to go ahead and include j/s
02:58 - forward slash and then we saved it as
03:00 - highlight j/s so now that we've got this
03:04 - plug-in available to use we can actually
03:07 - go ahead and use it now what I'm going
03:09 - to do is I'm not going to include the
03:11 - original functionality that I said with
03:15 - regards to highlight equals search I
03:17 - just feel this is going to be a bit too
03:19 - sort of long-winded and everything we're
03:22 - going to need an additional plugin to
03:23 - read the variables as well so what I'll
03:26 - go ahead and do is we'll just go and do
03:27 - the jQuery where I guess that's a bit
03:29 - more appropriate as well so okay inside
03:32 - another paragraph tag I want to go ahead
03:34 - and create my form so at the moment on
03:36 - my page we just have this sort of
03:37 - paragraph of text now what we want to go
03:40 - ahead and do is just create our first of
03:43 - all a text input type so text like that
03:45 - and then we want to go ahead and create
03:48 - a submit button as well or just a plain
03:50 - button so the type in this case it's
03:53 - going to be button so the value here of
03:55 - the button is going to just be find and
03:59 - you'll see that gives us the result here
04:00 - we've got a text input field and a fine
04:02 - button so we're going to go ahead and
04:04 - type something into here click find and
04:07 - the relevant information is going to be
04:08 - highlighted on the page now as part of
04:11 - this
04:12 - as part of this plugin we're going to
04:14 - need to specify a highlight class inside
04:16 - star dot CSS and obviously this can be
04:19 - tailored to how you want the particular
04:21 - word to be highlighted for example you
04:23 - could just want it bold or you know in
04:26 - any case it doesn't really matter in
04:28 - this case we're just going to highlight
04:29 - it with a background of yellow just to
04:31 - keep things simple so we need a way to
04:33 - reference these input fields or you know
04:37 - this input button as well using jQuery
04:39 - so we're going to need to go ahead and
04:40 - give these an ID so this one here will
04:43 - sorry ID this one here is going to be
04:45 - search underscore term so we can use
04:47 - that to grab the value of the text that
04:49 - we've typed and here I'm going to call
04:52 - this search underscore button okay so
04:55 - now that we've done this nothing on our
04:56 - page has change we just have our text
04:58 - field and find but we need to go into
05:00 - ext dot j s to actually pick up and
05:03 - apply an event handler to this button
05:06 - which will then in turn grab the value
05:08 - from this text field so inside ext is
05:12 - we're going to say document dot ready
05:14 - this just ensures that our document has
05:17 - loaded our elements have loaded or our
05:20 - Dom is ready and available to use so
05:24 - alternatively you could go ahead and use
05:25 - Windows load but that's I'm not really
05:29 - required in this in this case so once
05:32 - our document is ready we need to set up
05:33 - an event handler for our button so I'm
05:36 - going to go ahead and reference or
05:38 - select our button which is search
05:40 - underscore button so we use a hash and
05:43 - then search underscore button and we
05:45 - want to add the click event handler to
05:48 - this now inside here once we click this
05:51 - button we're going to run the code just
05:53 - here so the code that we want to run is
05:56 - obviously first of all we need to
05:57 - retrain our retrieve the value that
05:59 - we've typed into here so in this case
06:02 - I'm going to go ahead and create a
06:03 - variable and this is going to be called
06:05 - search underscore term which is going to
06:07 - be equal to selecting search underscore
06:10 - term and then dot Val so dot val and
06:14 - jquery just returns the value of the
06:16 - search term
06:17 - so I'm going to go ahead and just alert
06:19 - the search term out just to you know see
06:22 - if we've got everything working I'm
06:24 - going to go ahead and type in here
06:25 - search and click find and you see we
06:28 - have an alert dialog box saying search
06:30 - so essentially what's happened is we've
06:32 - clicked the button once we've clicked
06:35 - the button here we grab the search time
06:38 - using Val from this search term text
06:41 - field here and then we just go ahead and
06:43 - add an alert that out now obviously we
06:46 - don't just want to alert out we want to
06:48 - highlight it so at the moment we can't
06:50 - highlight anything unless we have a
06:52 - class set up to deal with the well to
06:56 - essentially highlight it I'm going to go
06:58 - ahead and open highlight j/s again just
07:00 - so we can take a look you see that
07:02 - essentially what happens when we search
07:03 - is we create a span element around this
07:07 - particular sorry around this particular
07:10 - search term so if we were to type search
07:14 - in here and click find a span element
07:17 - will be created around this search and
07:19 - the class that belongs to it you can see
07:21 - here span up class name is equal to
07:25 - highlight
