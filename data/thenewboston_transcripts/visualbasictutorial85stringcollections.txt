00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:07 - look at string collections now if you
00:09 - remember from the previous tutorials we
00:11 - looked at Stacks cues and array lists
00:13 - and all of those are collections now in
00:16 - this tutorial we're going we're going to
00:18 - be taking a look at string
00:20 - collections now string collections are
00:23 - very much like array list but instead of
00:27 - being able to store any data type you
00:29 - want in it such as uh such as using an
00:31 - integer and then the next item in the
00:33 - list is a string the next item is a
00:35 - double then maybe the next item is um an
00:39 - object of a class um with string
00:42 - collections you can only use type string
00:45 - but you can add as many as you want and
00:48 - uh it won't run out like an array so
00:51 - let's go ahead and get rid of this code
00:53 - that we used in the last tutorial and um
00:56 - if you don't have that project saved you
00:57 - can just make another one real quick we
00:59 - didn't add anything to the form we
01:00 - didn't do anything other than access the
01:02 - form one load event so we're going to
01:05 - come up here and we're going to declare
01:07 - a string collection so we'll call it
01:10 - string
01:12 - collection as new string
01:20 - collection and let's see
01:27 - here okay so if you got that same error
01:30 - that I got in the last where it cannot
01:33 - find string collection so if we type as
01:36 - new string
01:38 - collection it's not there so what we
01:40 - need to do is use the long form of this
01:43 - so we'll just go ahead and type system
01:46 - dot collections Dot and now we're going
01:48 - to use the keyword
01:50 - specialized and then string
01:55 - collection so now that we've created our
01:58 - string collection we can go ahead and
02:00 - add some stuff to it so it's um almost
02:03 - identical to array list so we can type
02:06 - string
02:08 - collection. add and let's add
02:12 - Sam now we can also come up here and
02:15 - create an array and add that array to
02:18 - our string collection so we'll just type
02:21 - private my array as string and we'll set
02:26 - that equal
02:27 - to Joe Jim and
02:33 - Bob and we can go ahead and add that in
02:36 - there using the
02:38 - same uh add range now ad range is um
02:43 - also usable in uh string Collections and
02:46 - array list so we'll just add the range
02:48 - my array so let going to add all the
02:51 - items in
02:52 - there now we can also use string
02:56 - collection.
02:58 - remove and we can remove remove
03:01 - gym now we can also remove at so string
03:06 - collection.
03:07 - [Music]
03:08 - remove at and it will remove at the
03:11 - index so let's remove at index zero so
03:13 - it's going to remove Sam so all we have
03:15 - left in our string collection is Joe and
03:19 - Bob so let's come over to
03:23 - our uh form one right here and whenever
03:26 - the form one loads let's just add all
03:28 - the items of our string colle section to
03:30 - a list
03:33 - box so we'll just go ahead and set the
03:35 - name property of this
03:39 - to list string
03:44 - collection so come back here and uh
03:47 - after we've initialized everything for
03:48 - our string string collection we'll type
03:51 - for each item as string in string
03:58 - collection
04:02 - then we'll just go ahead and type
04:04 - list um string collection. items. add
04:10 - and we'll add
04:14 - item okay so now when we run this we
04:17 - should get Joe and Bob added to
04:20 - our um list right
04:22 - here so we can also check to see if our
04:26 - string collection has a certain value in
04:28 - it so so we can just store this in a
04:31 - Bine so we'll just go ahead and type dim
04:35 - and then we'll just call it is there as
04:39 - boine and we'll set that equal
04:41 - to string
04:44 - collection Dot and now we can type
04:48 - contains it says determines whether
04:50 - specified string is in the string
04:52 - collection so we'll just see if it
04:54 - contains gy and this contains function
04:58 - right here returns either true or false
05:01 - which is why we declared is there as a
05:03 - bleen and now I'll just Ty message
05:07 - box is there dot to string so we convert
05:12 - that to a string and it should give us a
05:15 - value of false because we removed JY
05:20 - from
05:21 - it now let's go ahead and close out of
05:25 - this here now we can see if it contains
05:28 - Joe and this will return a value of
05:33 - true so go ahead uh work a little bit
05:37 - with string collections if you're
05:38 - familiar with array lists um by now
05:41 - string collections will be very easy for
05:43 - you to pick up um and then once you got
05:45 - those down go ahead and stay tuned for
05:47 - the next tutorial and thanks for
05:48 - watching guys
