00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at the bind event handler
00:10 - and how we can make use of it to make
00:12 - life uh or code a lot more
00:14 - efficient so let's take an example if we
00:17 - have a link on a page I'm going to go
00:19 - ahead and just outline a uh link it's
00:23 - not going to go anywhere and I'm just
00:24 - going to call this a
00:26 - link so let's go over to our browser and
00:29 - take a look you you can see that we've
00:30 - just got a link here uh it doesn't
00:32 - really do anything at the moment so what
00:34 - I want to do is when I hover over this
00:36 - link I want the text to change to bold
00:40 - so there are other ways of obviously
00:42 - doing this but with jQuery we can use
00:44 - the uh the bind event handler to
00:47 - actually handle for example all links on
00:49 - our page you might want all links to be
00:51 - underlined when they're click uh when
00:53 - they're hovered over or in in an actual
00:56 - fact you might not want them to be
00:58 - underlined so what we can do is we can
01:00 - go ahead and assign a particular class
01:02 - to this uh when we hover over or when we
01:05 - use the mouse
01:09 - over so we're going to be use the mouse
01:12 - enter and the mouse leave event handlers
01:15 - to actually go ahead and make this bold
01:18 - and add a class to this particular
01:21 - link so the class that we want to create
01:23 - is just going to be called bold uh and
01:25 - I'm going to just say font weight
01:30 - bold so wherever this class is is
01:33 - applied to a particular element in this
01:36 - case uh an a tag or an a element or a
01:39 - link element uh if you'd like to call it
01:42 - that the text inside will turn
01:45 - bold so let's go ahead and create a file
01:48 - that's going to handle our events so I'm
01:50 - going to create a new file and I'm going
01:52 - to save it inside the JS directory
01:55 - remember we're working with index.php in
01:57 - the root directory I'm going to go ahead
01:59 - and save it in JS as events.
02:02 - JS and in here we can start to write
02:04 - code that's going to handle the mouse
02:07 - enter and the mouse leave uh
02:10 - events so for example I'm going to go
02:13 - ahead and select all a so I'm using a
02:16 - selector and all a a elements on the
02:19 - page now I'm going to say mouse
02:23 - enter and inside here we need to create
02:26 - a function so the function will just be
02:29 - outlined and we can pull this down uh so
02:31 - we can start working inside now let's go
02:34 - ahead and just alert something out to
02:36 - test the usage of this so um over for
02:39 - example or enter would be more
02:43 - appropriate so inside of our browser
02:45 - let's go ahead and mouse over this oh it
02:47 - didn't do
02:48 - anything and that's because we haven't
02:50 - included the script on our page so let's
02:52 - go ahead and include the
02:55 - script so the type is
02:58 - text/javascript and the source remember
03:01 - inside our JS folder events. JS so back
03:05 - to our browser to test this I'm going to
03:07 - hover over or mouse or Mouse enter and
03:10 - it says enter so we know that this event
03:12 - is
03:13 - working now with this event this
03:15 - particular Mouse enter event we can then
03:18 - go ahead and add a class to this or or
03:22 - this a tag and that class is
03:24 - bold so uh we would normally say um
03:30 - this do add class and then we specify
03:35 - the name of the class which is bold so
03:39 - now what's going to happen is when we
03:40 - hover over the link this changes to bold
03:43 - because we've added a particular class
03:44 - to it obviously when we hover uh or our
03:48 - Mouse comes away from this um it we
03:50 - don't get the same effect so we need to
03:53 - use the mouse leave event to actually
03:57 - handle this as well so I'm going to go
03:59 - aad head and do this the long way and
04:01 - then we're going to take a look at bind
04:02 - in order to shorten this
04:05 - functionality so I'm going to at the end
04:07 - of this remember our fun our um outline
04:11 - starts here our Mouse enter here and
04:13 - then we've got a function inside but at
04:16 - the end of this I'm going to go ahead
04:17 - and append another event on and that is
04:20 - mouse leave so now inside here we can
04:23 - create another function and the code in
04:26 - here will be that of when the mouse
04:29 - leaves this particular element so we can
04:32 - again say this dot add or remove class
04:39 - sorry bold so when the mouse enters this
04:43 - a element so any link on the page or any
04:45 - a on the page we add the class bold to
04:49 - the a when the mouse leaves we then
04:52 - remove the class bold from the a so it
04:54 - sounds quite logical and the code is
04:57 - quite short uh let's go just go and take
04:59 - a look at functionality when we hover
05:01 - over or Mouse enter and when we Mouse
05:03 - leave the class is removed so we now
05:05 - have the functionality that we initially
05:08 - wanted for our
05:10 - links however if we go ahead and just
05:13 - get rid of this we can do this using
05:15 - bind and it will make the code a lot
05:18 - shorter uh and obviously a lot easier to
05:21 - uh to get our head around so I'm going
05:24 - to go ahead and again reference all a
05:26 - elements but this time I'm going to use
05:28 - the bind event handler
05:30 - now this is going to take two parameters
05:32 - as opposed to just creating a callback
05:35 - function inside of it as we normally
05:36 - would do we specify first uh the event
05:40 - that we want this to happen on and then
05:43 - we
05:44 - specify the uh action that we're going
05:46 - to take so this in here is the action
05:49 - and this in here is the event so on an
05:52 - event we're going to perform a
05:53 - particular action and this event is
05:55 - going to be Mouse enter and when the
05:59 - mouse Mouse enters we want to go ahead
06:01 - and apply the Bold class to this so we
06:03 - just say add
06:05 - class
06:07 - bold so now uh when we enter this a
06:11 - object we perform this function so much
06:15 - extremely similar to how we were doing
06:17 - it in the first place so let's go ahead
06:20 - and mouse over you see we have the same
06:22 - functionality however obviously when we
06:24 - Mouse uh out or when the mouse leaves
06:26 - this particular element uh the Bold
06:28 - class isn't
06:30 - removed so now instead of then appending
06:33 - something else onto here uh you might
06:35 - think that adding
06:37 - bind and then Mouse leave and then
06:41 - another function here would do the same
06:44 - job which it will do if we were to say
06:46 - remove the
06:48 - class so we we're using like the same
06:50 - thing but this doesn't really cut our
06:52 - code down or make anything more
06:54 - efficient uh it works the same way uh
06:56 - but obviously there's always better ways
06:58 - to do things so instead what we're going
07:01 - to do is with the bind uh event handler
07:03 - we can specify a series of um events
07:06 - that we want to use so for example Mouse
07:09 - enter and mouse
07:11 - leave so now on Mouse enter and on Mouse
07:15 - leave we add a class to bold now
07:17 - obviously this isn't going to uh work it
07:19 - doesn't really make sense when we Mouse
07:20 - over and mouse leave we're just adding
07:22 - the class once again however just taking
07:26 - a minute to research different um you
07:29 - know different things class functions we
07:32 - know that there is a toggle class
07:34 - function and what toggle class will do
07:37 - is it will check if a particular class
07:40 - is applied and if it is it will remove
07:42 - it and if it's not applied it will add
07:44 - it so much like the toggle as in where
07:47 - you would show something show a
07:48 - particular element with jQuery what
07:51 - we're now doing is on Mouse enter and
07:53 - mouse s we're toggling this uh bold
07:56 - class so now what's going to happen is
07:58 - when we go in in the toggle class
08:02 - obviously saw that uh the Bold class
08:04 - wasn't applied to this element so it
08:06 - applied it but now when we Mouse out
08:09 - again which is this part of here Mouse
08:12 - leave we remove the class because it was
08:15 - already added to that particular
08:17 - element so using bind has cut our code
08:21 - down dramatically from I think six lines
08:24 - to three lines and we've also created
08:27 - something that's more you know except
08:29 - able to um how you would usually write
08:32 - something you know what's the point in
08:34 - writing additional code when you can
08:37 - write that code in these three lines uh
08:40 - what's essentially regarded as the
08:41 - correct way so just using bind you can
08:44 - go ahead and use it obviously with any
08:46 - other element and any event that would
08:49 - be appropriately associated with that
08:51 - element so we can choose to use lots of
08:54 - different uh events and lots of and and
08:57 - apply that to lots of different of
08:58 - elements and we have toggle uh found in
09:01 - a variety of places as well so we can
09:03 - use toggle if
09:06 - appropriate so that's the bind uh event
09:09 - handler in jQuery and how useful it can
09:12 - be
