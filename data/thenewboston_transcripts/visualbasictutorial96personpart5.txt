00:03 - and I think one more time okay so now
00:10 - what we need to do is handle in case
00:13 - there is no person inside of the list
00:17 - people so we'll go ahead and type an
00:19 - else statement right here so if there
00:23 - isn't anything selected then we'll just
00:25 - go ahead and type message box dot show
00:32 - please select a person
00:40 - and then we'll set the title to warning
00:44 - we'll set the message box buttons dot to
00:48 - okay and we will set the icon to warning
00:53 - so message box icon dot let's just do
00:57 - exclamation okay so if we go ahead and
01:03 - run this we'll go ahead and click the
01:06 - play you can see we have our form under
01:09 - our form one right here we click new
01:12 - person I'll just add Sam click OK you
01:16 - can see we get the current weight the
01:17 - current money and the current income and
01:19 - now we can have Sam eat work and
01:22 - exercise and you can see that it's going
01:25 - to update and I can increase the income
01:28 - you can exercise even more can work even
01:32 - more and I can also eat and get fatter
01:34 - now before we finish the program there's
01:38 - a couple things we need to do to make it
01:41 - work better and to prevent errors so on
01:44 - the form one load we're going to have we
01:46 - we're going to have to disable these
01:48 - buttons right here because they click
01:50 - them it's just going to crash the
01:53 - program because there's no selected
01:54 - person so come back to form or VB and we
01:58 - will add a sub that will disable all of
02:01 - those so what is called private sub
02:05 - disabled buttons and we will type button
02:13 - eat dot enabled equals false button
02:22 - exercise dot enabled equals false and
02:27 - I'm going to go ahead and type all this
02:29 - in and then come back when it's fit okay
02:31 - so you can see that I created the sub
02:33 - disabled buttons and I just set each one
02:36 - of the buttons enabled to equal to equal
02:38 - false so button exercised that enabled
02:40 - equals false and I made a reverse sub of
02:43 - this called enable buttons which will
02:47 - just set each one of those equal to true
02:48 - so now we need to do is come up here to
02:51 - form one load
02:53 - and when the forum unloads since by
02:57 - default the selected index is going to
02:59 - be negative one for our list box we're
03:01 - just going to type disabled buttons and
03:04 - now we'll come down here and let's see
03:09 - list people so I can index change so if
03:11 - the selected index is not equal to
03:13 - negative one then go ahead and enable
03:15 - the buttons and else we'll just disabled
03:20 - buttons okay so now let's go ahead and
03:24 - run this and you can see that we have
03:27 - our program right here we got the
03:29 - current weight which is nothing current
03:30 - money which is nothing current income
03:32 - which is nothing and you can see that
03:34 - these buttons right here are disabled
03:36 - because there's no person so let's just
03:38 - create a new person we'll call him Sam
03:40 - and when we select that person you can
03:43 - see that it updates right here we can
03:45 - have a meet we can have him work we can
03:47 - have we can increase the income and
03:50 - we'll do whatever we want to now we can
03:53 - create another new person let's just
03:55 - create John Doe and see that when we
03:57 - click on John Doe it gets the current
04:00 - weight and the current money and the
04:02 - current income which is default now we
04:04 - can add as many of these as we want and
04:07 - we can keep accessing different people
04:09 - so let's have him exercise having eat
04:12 - some more I will have him work to make a
04:15 - lot of money you can see that when we
04:18 - select these we get the values that are
04:20 - attached to each one of these people so
04:23 - this is the end of working on our person
04:28 - program what I want you guys to do is
04:30 - create input boxes that will get the
04:32 - pounds to eat how many hours to work how
04:35 - many hours to exercise and how much to
04:37 - increase the income so that your program
04:38 - is a little bit more functional and it
04:42 - just looks a little bit nicer and it
04:44 - works better so I'm thanks for watching
04:46 - guys and stay tuned for the next
04:47 - tutorial
