00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:07 - talking about nested namespaces now just
00:10 - like a whole bunch of stuff inside of
00:12 - Visual Basic you can nest namespaces so
00:15 - let's go ahead and get rid of this code
00:18 - that we have already added so we will
00:21 - delete our person and if you have no
00:23 - clue what this code is then you might
00:25 - want to go ahead and move back a couple
00:28 - of tutorials see what we're doing okay
00:31 - so what we can do is come up here and we
00:36 - can just create another namespace to
00:39 - nest people other people and friends
00:42 - inside of it so we'll just go ahead and
00:44 - type namespace all people and then we
00:50 - can go ahead and end that with an end
00:53 - namespace so you can see that we have
00:57 - they have sex all people and then we
00:59 - have two namespaces nested inside of it
01:02 - so this is a better way of organizing
01:07 - your types inside of Visual Basic but
01:09 - there's also another way of nesting
01:11 - namespaces that I will go into in the
01:14 - next tutorial is a little bit better
01:15 - than this but I figured I should teach
01:17 - you guys this anyway because it's always
01:20 - good to know if you need it so we'll go
01:22 - ahead and come back over here to form
01:24 - one BB and we'll go ahead and create an
01:29 - object so we'll type private friend or
01:35 - here my friend or here let's do my new
01:43 - friend as new things here that we're
01:48 - gonna have to specify the namespace all
01:50 - people so all people dot friends dot
01:56 - people
01:59 - so now we have access to all the stuff
02:01 - that is inside of people inside of our
02:06 - friends namespace so we can access the
02:09 - properties first name last name and
02:10 - years friends so let's just go ahead and
02:14 - send the year's friends - okay so we'll
02:20 - go ahead and come back here to our forum
02:22 - one maybe maybe didn't know what I just
02:24 - did there I added was the the integer
02:29 - years friends - the two string to the
02:34 - override to string function so it will
02:38 - give us back the first name last name
02:40 - and years friends so let's just go ahead
02:44 - and add another text box here so come
02:48 - down here and select text box and we
02:55 - will add another label and we will say
03:03 - years being friends
03:12 - okay so now let's come over here to our
03:14 - four Mondavi B now what we want to do is
03:17 - we want to select set the properties of
03:19 - my new friend whenever the button one is
03:22 - clicked so my new friend first name
03:26 - equals text first name dot text and then
03:30 - my new friend dot last name equals text
03:33 - last name dot text and they'll do that
03:37 - one more time for the years friend so
03:39 - dot year's friends equals and what we're
03:44 - gonna need to do is we're going to need
03:45 - to convert this to a an integer because
03:51 - you can see that under our years friends
03:54 - property it's an integer type so we're
03:57 - gonna do is we'll come over here back to
03:59 - four Mondavi beam will type c type and
04:03 - for our first argument is going to be
04:05 - the object so we're going to use over
04:13 - here
04:13 - textbox one dot text and we want to
04:18 - convert that to an integer and then
04:21 - textbox 1 dot dot text is this right
04:24 - here because we didn't actually rename
04:25 - it so let's go ahead and run this and
04:28 - see what happens so we can add the first
04:31 - name Jim Harris and years being friends
04:35 - as I say we've known each other for 23
04:37 - years
04:37 - click show person and we forgot to show
04:42 - the person so let's come back here and
04:44 - we will type message box my new friend
04:48 - dot two string and we'll go ahead and
04:53 - run this
04:55 - and once again we'll type Jim Harris and
04:59 - 23 years being friends and what we show
05:02 - the person we at Jim Harris 23 so go
05:06 - ahead and practice nesting namespaces
05:09 - you can nest as many as you want but
05:11 - what you want to keep in mind is that
05:13 - you need to keep your code simple and
05:15 - easy to read so that lets say some other
05:17 - developer looks at your code they should
05:19 - be able to figure out what's going on
05:20 - without having to read through object
05:22 - and try to understand it themselves so
05:24 - don't be nesting native spaces all over
05:27 - the place and make it really confusing
05:29 - but just go ahead and practice nesting
05:31 - some namespaces and once you've done
05:33 - that go ahead and move on to the next
05:35 - tutorial
