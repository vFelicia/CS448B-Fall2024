00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 37th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
00:05 - I'm going to be talking to you guys
00:06 - about how to add material to your
00:08 - terrain yes this is going to be awesome
00:11 - but before I begin I want to tell you
00:12 - guys this I got a new YouTube channel
00:15 - it's called the New Boston TV and on
00:19 - that channel I'm going to be adding all
00:20 - my personal stuff like I'm going to be
00:22 - doing live radio shows every now and
00:24 - then I'm and I'm just going to be making
00:25 - you know personal blogs and update
00:28 - videos so if you guys you know want to
00:30 - stalk me want to see what's going on in
00:31 - my life I definitely recommend you
00:33 - subscribe to that channel it's called
00:34 - the New Boston TV and give you a nice
00:37 - little you know break from my work
00:39 - making tutorials and into my personal
00:41 - life so um subscribe to that channel and
00:44 - then this channel is going to stay my
00:46 - tutorial channel so anyways just want to
00:48 - tell you guys about that nice little
00:49 - plug so now like promised I want to
00:53 - teach you guys how to add materials to
00:55 - your map and again my materials I mean
00:57 - add grass and rocks and dirt and you can
01:01 - maybe make this mountain a mountain with
01:03 - the grass on the bottom and a rocky
01:04 - mountain with snow on top of it so we
01:07 - can acheve that through the use of
01:08 - materials but before I just start
01:10 - plopping materials down my map I want to
01:12 - talk to you guys about how materials are
01:15 - going to work in the udk so right now
01:18 - you see that we have one layer and that
01:20 - layer is a height map now like I said in
01:22 - the last tutoral a hyp map is basically
01:25 - a map that tells your udk which area
01:28 - should be raised which area should be
01:30 - lowered which area should be flat it's
01:33 - pretty much a map telling well just like
01:35 - I said just that but we can add other
01:39 - layers to the udk as well now the other
01:42 - layers we're going to be adding is a
01:44 - material layer such as grass and we're
01:46 - going to be adding another layer for
01:48 - rocks and we can even add a layer for
01:51 - trees and plants and bushes so basically
01:54 - everything in our terrain gets added in
01:56 - layers so I just want to tell you guys
01:58 - that before we continue because it might
02:00 - give you a little better understanding
02:01 - of what we're trying to accomplish so
02:04 - what we're going to be doing now is
02:05 - since we already have our height map
02:06 - layer we're going to be adding a grass
02:08 - layer so in order to add a grass layer
02:11 - the first thing we need is a grass
02:13 - material so go ahead and clear
02:14 - everything out and there are a bunch of
02:17 - different materials that are built into
02:18 - udk if you go ahead and search rock and
02:21 - make sure you have material selected
02:22 - there's a bunch of good ones right here
02:25 - uh for you know this one's pretty good
02:27 - one right there however I'm going to be
02:29 - searching
02:31 - ground because there's one I like right
02:33 - here ground Master 01 so I'm going to go
02:36 - ahead and select that and X Out of the
02:38 - content browser now it's still selected
02:41 - so keep that in mind so in order to make
02:44 - this ground my base layer here's what I
02:46 - need to do in the layer panel right here
02:49 - and of course if you have this closed
02:51 - out just go ahead and hit terrain
02:53 - editing mode and it'll pop back up go
02:55 - ahead and rightclick and select this
02:57 - right here new terrain setup layer from
03:00 - material autocreate and this is going to
03:03 - basically take the material that you
03:04 - selected and it's going to set up a new
03:07 - layer on your terrain for it so go ahead
03:09 - and click it and it takes a minute to uh
03:11 - you know load it and everything but now
03:14 - you have a new terrain editing layer so
03:17 - now check it out what happens when we
03:20 - paint as you can see you can see a
03:22 - little bit better than you know whether
03:25 - you were
03:27 - just doing that with a default gray and
03:30 - purple so what I typically like to do is
03:33 - whenever I'm making a map I I usually
03:35 - like to make the outside mountains
03:37 - because that way the user can't Venture
03:39 - off into the um distant void so that's
03:44 - basically all there is to add a new base
03:47 - layer so this is nice we got a new layer
03:51 - of grass covering our entire map we're
03:54 - saying all right that's cool and all but
03:56 - what if we could add even another
03:58 - texture because usually when you step
04:00 - outside you don't see grass forever and
04:02 - ever you see rocks and trees and you see
04:05 - some dirt and water so let's go ahead
04:07 - and add another layer and I'm going to
04:09 - teach you guys how to do that so go
04:11 - ahead and open your content browser and
04:13 - clear everything out again make sure you
04:15 - have material selected though and let me
04:18 - think of something to look for I guess I
04:20 - can just look for a rock or
04:22 - something and let me look for a good
04:26 - rock ooh these look pretty good I like
04:29 - this one right here um it's called black
04:31 - spire1 if you want to follow along with
04:33 - me so go ahead and select that ex out of
04:35 - your content browser and right click on
04:37 - the empty spot on your layers panel and
04:40 - click new terrain setup from material
04:43 - autocreate so it's going to create that
04:45 - layer but nothing's going to happen
04:48 - pretty weird huh so in order for this
04:50 - layer to show what we need to do is
04:52 - paint this layer on and tell Youk
04:54 - exactly where we want it to appear so go
04:57 - ahead and make sure your layer selected
04:59 - just like that and whenever we select it
05:01 - we're basically using the rock as paint
05:03 - now go ahead and make sure you have your
05:05 - paintbrush and I'm actually going to
05:07 - bring my radius down a tidbit because
05:11 - what I'm going to be doing
05:13 - is I want to paint this only in specific
05:16 - locations so let's go ahead and hold
05:18 - control and start to paint and now you
05:22 - can see that well basically exactly like
05:26 - you expect it's painting on that rock
05:28 - texture wherever I'm telling it to so
05:32 - that's pretty cool that's how you get
05:33 - you know a nice little rocky texture
05:35 - wherever you want
05:36 - it so maybe it's like Rocky here maybe
05:39 - the inside of this mountain is
05:42 - Rocky and yeah that's basically how you
05:44 - work with multiple layers in the udk so
05:47 - I'm going to be putting rocks on top of
05:49 - my mountains because hey if one mountain
05:53 - has rocks on top of it they probably all
05:54 - do so I think that's a nice look right
05:57 - there but usually whenever I'm creating
06:00 - a game and whenever you're creating a
06:03 - game here's what I recommend this is not
06:04 - like a udk tip this is just a game
06:06 - development tip is you usually want to
06:09 - make a path somewhere in your terrain so
06:11 - the user has kind of a general idea of
06:14 - where to follow if you ever played like
06:16 - World of Warcraft and Zoda you notice
06:18 - that they had kind of dirt pass giving
06:20 - you a general idea of where you're
06:21 - supposed to run to because if you were
06:23 - to go ahead and right click and hit play
06:25 - from here you usually would be like uh
06:28 - okay so there's not even like a kind of
06:30 - a clue on where you're supposed to go
06:32 - because everything kind of looks just
06:34 - like Bland so go ahead and I'm going to
06:36 - be adding one more layer and I'm just
06:39 - going to go ahead and first clear
06:41 - everything out and make sure we have
06:43 - material selected and what can I search
06:45 - for just go ahead and search for dirt or
06:47 - something and go ahead and grab this
06:49 - terrain dirt and once you have that
06:51 - selected go ahead and add a new layer
06:53 - for terrain dirt and make sure we have
06:56 - our terrain dirt layer selected and go
06:59 - ahead and paint this on so I'm going to
07:01 - bring the radius way
07:02 - down right about to 28 and since my
07:06 - player is going to be starting right
07:07 - here that's where I want to start my
07:09 - turn so what I'm going to like to do is
07:11 - hold down control and just paint that
07:14 - and now I'm going to make a path in
07:16 - between these mountains right here and
07:19 - as you can see once we start creating
07:20 - this path it's going to give like the
07:22 - user I want to say let me move my camera
07:26 - a tidbit it's gonna give the user a
07:28 - general idea of where to run around in
07:31 - the map so again they would be kind of
07:34 - lost and now they have kind of a feeling
07:36 - that all right there's a road here I
07:38 - should probably travel along it to see
07:40 - what's at the end of it so now if we go
07:42 - ahead and plop our player down right
07:44 - here play from here again you can kind
07:47 - of see that all right they're running
07:49 - around okay I'm not just running around
07:51 - blindlessly anymore I have an actual
07:53 - path that I need to follow and maybe the
07:55 - user can go along this path and you know
07:58 - buy some illegal drugs and sell them to
08:00 - little kids or something I don't know if
08:01 - you're making a game like that you could
08:02 - do that but that's the basics of how you
08:05 - add multiple materials to give your
08:07 - terrain a unique look and feel so that's
08:10 - all you guys get in this tutorial in the
08:11 - next tutorial we have all these tools to
08:13 - cover and you know a whole bunch of
08:15 - stuff to cover but for now like I said
08:17 - that's all you guys get so thank you for
08:18 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
08:20 - I'll see you guys later
