00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:06 - gonna be taking another look at I
00:08 - dispose Abel and specifically we're
00:10 - gonna be learning about the using
00:12 - keyword now you learned in the last
00:15 - tutorial that you can create objects and
00:17 - dispose of them once you're finished
00:19 - with them by implementing I disposable
00:22 - inside of your class now what you can
00:25 - also do is use the using keyword so that
00:29 - the program will automatically dispose
00:31 - of that object
00:33 - once it's done doing what it needs to do
00:35 - so to create a little example of this
00:38 - let's go ahead and go and to do stuff
00:40 - and add a couple more subs so public sub
00:46 - let's see show more messages and we'll
00:53 - just type message box this is a message
00:59 - and we can go ahead and copy that a
01:01 - couple more times okay so now we'll come
01:07 - back into form one dot V B and we will
01:10 - delete all this code that we have right
01:12 - here and what we can do instead of
01:16 - creating a new object by using the dim
01:20 - keyword we can go ahead and type using
01:23 - and see that the description says a
01:25 - using block does three things it creates
01:27 - and initializes variables in the
01:29 - resource list it runs the code in the
01:30 - block and it disposes of the variables
01:32 - before exiting so it pretty much just
01:35 - does what it needs to do and then get
01:37 - rid of everything after it's done so
01:40 - let's go ahead and set a name for the
01:42 - object of do stuff that we want so let's
01:48 - just call this one my do stuff as and
01:52 - then we're gonna use the new keyword so
01:54 - we actually create an object in the
01:56 - using block so as new do stuff and now
02:02 - I'm going to do is we're gonna hit enter
02:03 - and you can see that adds the end using
02:06 - for us so we can type my do stuff dot
02:11 - show message
02:13 - and then we can go ahead and run this
02:18 - and you can see that one click show
02:21 - message it says this is a message and
02:23 - then once we click OK it'll tell you
02:27 - know the compiler will know or your
02:29 - program will know that it is done using
02:32 - my do stuff and it will get rid of it so
02:34 - we can also add more code in here so I
02:37 - do stuff dot so more messages so let's
02:50 - go ahead and run this and you see that
02:53 - once it's done showing more messages and
02:55 - then showing a message it's gonna go
02:56 - ahead and get rid of our object for us
02:58 - so we can Excel message it'll say this
03:01 - is a message and then this should be the
03:04 - last one and click OK and it gets rid of
03:06 - our object for us but if you notice that
03:13 - if we try to access access my do stuff
03:16 - outside of our using block we're gonna
03:20 - get an error now this is an example of
03:22 - scope and what scope is is if you
03:25 - remember from one of the previous
03:26 - tutorials is that wherever you define
03:30 - your variable that's the only place it
03:31 - can be used so if I define a variable
03:34 - inside here as string if I try to access
03:39 - that outside of this sub right here I'm
03:41 - gonna get an error because it is only
03:43 - allowed to be used inside of this sub
03:46 - right here and the same applies for the
03:49 - using block whatever you are using right
03:51 - here can only be accessed inside of the
03:54 - using block and then once it's done with
03:58 - it it gets rid of it and you cannot
03:59 - access it anymore so go ahead you can
04:03 - practice using the using keyword you can
04:06 - even maybe go back to some of the
04:08 - previous programs that we've made and
04:09 - find some places that you can sort of
04:12 - put that in there to make the code a
04:13 - little bit more efficient and then once
04:15 - you do that go ahead and move on to the
04:17 - next tutorial and we will be learning
04:20 - more about eye disposable so thanks for
04:22 - watching
