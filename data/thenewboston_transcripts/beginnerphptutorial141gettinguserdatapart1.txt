00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - boston now we've already established how
00:07 - to log a user in depending on database
00:10 - values such as Alex or Billy both here
00:12 - now when we do login let's go ahead and
00:16 - log me in you'll see that we have you're
00:21 - logged in log out that's absolutely fine
00:23 - now the one thing that we're missing -
00:25 - you know round off our website once
00:29 - users logged in is we're not displaying
00:32 - specific information about the user that
00:35 - is logged in you already know that the
00:38 - users ID which is unique to each user is
00:41 - stored in a session here so at the
00:45 - moment this value here this session will
00:48 - be equal to one because I've logged in
00:52 - as Alex so the idea has been set to one
00:54 - now inside corridor Inc dot PHP which
00:58 - remember we set up to be included in
01:00 - every file we want to create a function
01:03 - to be able to grab any field from our
01:07 - database here depending on the ID so
01:13 - this is going to shorten the amount of
01:16 - code we do inside our our our actual
01:21 - fight our files ourself so inside this
01:23 - cording dot PHP we're going to create a
01:25 - function which we can use however many
01:27 - times we want and also it will save a
01:29 - lot of resources as well so it won't
01:31 - slow down your server as much and won't
01:34 - perform as many queries so where do we
01:40 - start we need to outline the skeleton
01:42 - skeleton of our function so I'm going to
01:45 - call this get field okay so what
01:50 - arguments is this function going to take
01:52 - so get field the first important bit of
01:55 - information we need is the ID the user's
01:58 - ID the second we need is the field name
02:02 - so I'm just going to call this field
02:03 - okay so we need the user ID the supplied
02:07 - user ID and we need the field in fact
02:10 - looking at this we don't actually need
02:12 - the user ID
02:13 - already stored isn't it okay so we don't
02:16 - need the user ID we just need the field
02:18 - name this is going to grab the
02:21 - corresponding data from the field
02:23 - specified from this users table so the
02:28 - first thing we need to do is make is
02:30 - create a variable up here which is going
02:32 - to hold the value
02:34 - fadna we don't need to do that I'm just
02:37 - making it longer for myself
02:38 - so I'm going to write global dollar
02:41 - underscore session user ID now the
02:46 - reason I've done this is and I have a
02:49 - tutorial on why you need to do this and
02:52 - in fact maybe I don't think we even need
02:54 - to do that do it okay so let's echo this
02:57 - out and we'll see if this works so echo
03:00 - out basically the session the users ID
03:04 - so we'll come to index dot PHP you're
03:07 - logged in so let's create a line break
03:10 - there and down here we'll let's run the
03:13 - function get field okay so let's go back
03:17 - to our page and we'll see what we come
03:19 - up with okay yeah so we echo one now
03:24 - this get field we're aiming by the end
03:28 - of this tutorial
03:29 - to display the users name okay from in
03:35 - after this logged in so we're going to
03:36 - say you're logged in Alex Garret
03:39 - obviously not everyone is called an X
03:41 - camera tweet so we need to use this get
03:43 - field and function to make this work
03:46 - well so the first thing we need to do is
03:50 - we need to perform a query so the query
03:55 - equals and select now we need to specify
04:00 - the field
04:01 - so that's field and that's encased in
04:04 - apostrophes from users
04:09 - we're and this is the important part ID
04:14 - equals so let's just a pasta please buy
04:18 - all this we're ID is equal to dollar and
04:24 - the score session and that is user ID
04:29 - let's just them concatenate this on so
04:34 - it looks a bit tidier
04:35 - okay so select the field that we specify
04:39 - in here from users where the ID is equal
04:42 - to something okay so this is get a guest
04:47 - get user field we can call this because
04:50 - it's only selecting from the table users
04:53 - so get user field and we specify a field
04:55 - in here then what we need to do is we
04:59 - need to execute the query so query run
05:01 - is equal to MySQL query query and we
05:08 - need to encase this in an if statement
05:10 - to ensure that we only execute this
05:13 - block here if this query is successful
05:17 - so if the we're basically saying in
05:19 - plain English if this query is
05:21 - successful then what we need to do is we
05:24 - need to grab this data so we're going to
05:27 - return and what we're going to return is
05:30 - my SQL result and the result is from the
05:36 - query run the row 0 because we remember
05:42 - we're only returning one row and because
05:45 - there's only ever going to be one ID and
05:47 - the field we can pop again in here so
05:50 - field let's just get rid of them single
05:53 - quotation mark so field
