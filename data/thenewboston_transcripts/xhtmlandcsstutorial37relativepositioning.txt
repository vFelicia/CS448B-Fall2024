00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome back to your 37th xhtml and CSS
00:05 - tutorial and in this tutorial as
00:07 - promised I'm going to be talking to you
00:08 - guys about a different kind of
00:10 - positioning and that's called relative
00:12 - positioning now relative positioning is
00:15 - kind of similar to Absolute positioning
00:17 - but it's also very different so you're
00:20 - saying how can it be similar and
00:22 - extremely different but it is so let me
00:24 - go ahead and show that to you guys let's
00:25 - go ahead and first make a couple
00:28 - paragraphs on the screen so p
00:31 - p and just go ahead and like write first
00:34 - let me just go ahead and copy this make
00:35 - like four paragraphs or something
00:37 - that'll be fine
00:39 - first
00:41 - second third and fourth but give this
00:46 - third one an ID
00:49 - oops I'm uh computer programming in
00:53 - computer programming you put equal sign
00:55 - twice and that's what I thought I was
00:56 - doing so anyways ID equals third by the
01:00 - way you guys should check out my
01:02 - computer program tutorials they're
01:03 - pretty cool that's just a side note but
01:06 - anyways now for our third paragraph
01:09 - let's first of all give it absolute
01:10 - positioning cuz that's what we know
01:12 - already so in order to do that go ahead
01:15 - and make your ID third and go ahead and
01:19 - give it a border of like whoa definitely
01:22 - spell that wrong border one pixel solid
01:26 - green that'll make it easy to see and uh
01:30 - what else can we
01:31 - do
01:33 - position
01:35 - absolute and now let's go ahead and move
01:38 - it
01:39 - top 60 pixels and also
01:43 - left um 30
01:47 - pixels I don't like my top and left to
01:49 - be the same so anyways if we go ahead
01:51 - and save this what we're going to see is
01:53 - this we're going to see I mean four
01:56 - paragraphs on the screen and then we're
01:58 - going to see that third paragraph
02:00 - move 60 pixels down from this top point
02:03 - right here and 30 pixels right so
02:06 - somewhere right in there so check it out
02:09 - we have the first second third and this
02:12 - third box right here from the top left
02:14 - corner of your screen is move down 60
02:17 - pixels and right 30 pixels because
02:21 - that's what absolute positioning does it
02:23 - takes this coordinate right here and it
02:26 - moves your box in relation to there so
02:28 - let's go ahead and now instead of
02:30 - absolute type
02:32 - in relative and save this and look how
02:35 - it
02:37 - changes the box is now down more and
02:41 - over to the right the same so saying all
02:44 - right what exactly is going on because
02:46 - this is kind of confusing so instead of
02:49 - 60 pixels from the top it's now a lot
02:52 - more so why did this happen well
02:55 - relative positioning is different than
02:57 - absolute positioning in the the idea
03:00 - that instead of moving it absolutely
03:03 - from the top left point right here it
03:07 - moves it in relation to where it would
03:09 - normally be so instead of having the
03:11 - origin right here and moving 60 down 30
03:14 - across the origin is wherever it would
03:16 - be normally which is somewhere right in
03:19 - here and from that point it moves it 60
03:21 - down and 30 across so that's why it's
03:24 - actually more than 60 pixels down from
03:27 - the very top of your screen again if I
03:30 - was to move this absolutely it would be
03:32 - 60 pixels down from the top and 30
03:34 - pixels over but since I'm moving it
03:37 - relatively it says all right you start
03:40 - it out well let's go ahead and uh get
03:43 - rid of this cut
03:45 - this so you started out right here by
03:48 - default so here is your starting point
03:51 - right here and now you have the CSS rule
03:54 - that says I want to move this 60 pixels
03:57 - down from where I was relative and also
04:00 - 30 pixels over so it's going to take it
04:02 - from right here move it 60 down and 30
04:04 - over so that's why it ends up right here
04:07 - so anyways that's the difference between
04:09 - absolute and relative absolute moves it
04:12 - from the top left point on your screen
04:14 - and relatives move it from where it was
04:16 - in relation to the rest so now you can
04:19 - see that we come across another problem
04:22 - that it doesn't really help to uh you
04:24 - might be saying all right I'm just going
04:27 - to make everything relative then instead
04:28 - of absolute because relatives better
04:31 - well we come across this problem you see
04:33 - instead of just taking this piece out
04:35 - right here and continuing the flow where
04:38 - first second fourth instead of just
04:41 - moving this fourth up and filling in the
04:42 - Gap we now have a space or a gap of
04:46 - where that box used to be right here so
04:49 - with absolute we came across the problem
04:50 - of things overlapping and now relative
04:54 - we come across the problem of whenever
04:56 - we take something out from the natural
04:57 - flow we have a huge gap of where it used
05:00 - to be and it doesn't look like anything
05:02 - really fits in there so anyways keep
05:04 - those in mind whenever you're using
05:06 - these two different types of positioning
05:08 - and by the way let me say this people
05:10 - usually don't lay out a web page all
05:13 - absolute or all relative this isn't like
05:16 - a choice where you choose one or the
05:18 - other yes you can make an entire web
05:20 - page all absolute or all relative but
05:23 - you usually use use them in conjunction
05:26 - with one another for example you might
05:28 - have your out side box relative and
05:31 - every inside box inside that would be
05:33 - absolute that is a common technique that
05:36 - people use but anyways I just want to
05:38 - you know get that in your head cuz in
05:40 - case you thought I was teaching guys the
05:42 - different ways of laying out a website
05:45 - don't think like that think how can I
05:46 - use these techniques together in order
05:49 - to give my web page the look that I need
05:51 - to achieve so anyways there is one last
05:55 - type of positioning that I'm going to be
05:56 - teaching you guys about and then after
05:58 - that I'm going to show you guys how to
06:00 - tie everything together and give your
06:02 - website the exact look and feel that you
06:05 - guys want and it's going to be awesome
06:07 - you guys are going to be making
