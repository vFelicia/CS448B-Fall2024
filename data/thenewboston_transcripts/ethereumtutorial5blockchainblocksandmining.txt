00:00 - alrighty y'all welcome back to another
00:02 - video and in this tutorial we're going
00:03 - to be talking about the blockchain
00:05 - blocks and the mining process
00:08 - so to kick things off we already know
00:10 - that the ethereum network is composed of
00:14 - nodes
00:15 - and we also know that users can connect
00:17 - to the network through these nodes
00:20 - now once connected users can create
00:22 - transactions and send them to the
00:24 - network through these nodes now once a
00:27 - node receives an incoming transaction
00:31 - what it's going to do is actually send
00:32 - that to all other nodes that it's
00:34 - connected to
00:36 - so let me get some cool green arrows
00:38 - going here so say that this node right
00:40 - here received this transaction what it
00:42 - would do is it would send it to this
00:44 - node this node in this node and
00:46 - these nodes upon receiving the
00:48 - transaction they would send it to all
00:50 - nodes that they are connected to so
00:52 - that's how a single transaction coming
00:54 - from a user to a single node is
00:56 - essentially going to propagate
00:58 - throughout the entire network until
01:00 - every single node
01:01 - receives that incoming transaction
01:03 - now as more and more people begin to
01:05 - send transactions into the network each
01:08 - of these nodes upon receiving these
01:10 - transactions are going to start
01:12 - combining them into a potential block
01:16 - so for now we can think of a block
01:17 - simply as a list or group of
01:20 - transactions although as we're going to
01:22 - see in just a second there's actually a
01:24 - bit more to it but for now we'll just
01:26 - stick with the simple definition of a
01:28 - potential block is simply a list of
01:30 - transactions so either way once a node
01:33 - has a block of transactions what it can
01:36 - do then is begin validating and
01:38 - executing those transactions and by
01:40 - validating i mean ensuring that the data
01:42 - is properly formatted that the user
01:44 - included enough fees so on and so forth
01:47 - so this is when things get interesting
01:49 - because before these transactions can be
01:52 - considered finalized each node is then
01:55 - going to attempt to solve a difficult
01:58 - puzzle and this puzzle
02:01 - is going to require a lot of computing
02:03 - power now by solving this puzzle
02:05 - nodes can prove that they did work by
02:08 - using computational resources and by the
02:10 - way even though you couldn't see i had
02:12 - quotes around prove and work in that
02:15 - sense and that's because this process of
02:18 - trying to solve this puzzle this is
02:20 - called proof of work so to produce a
02:23 - valid block a node not only needs to
02:26 - validate a list of transactions but also
02:29 - provide a correct solution to this
02:32 - difficult puzzle
02:34 - now whenever a node is able to produce a
02:37 - valid block then what it's going to do
02:39 - with that block well a couple different
02:41 - things the first thing it's going to do
02:43 - is it's going to add it to its own
02:45 - blockchain and we'll talk a little bit
02:47 - more about this blockchain in just a bit
02:49 - but for now just remember that it's
02:51 - going to take that valid block and it's
02:53 - going to add it to their own blockchain
02:55 - and on top of that they're also going to
02:57 - take that block and send it out to all
03:00 - other nodes that they are connected to
03:03 - now these nodes upon receiving this new
03:06 - block they're first and foremost going
03:08 - to validate it to make sure that the
03:10 - results and everything else is good the
03:12 - solution is correct so on and so forth
03:14 - and as long as everything looks good
03:17 - then they are going to add it to their
03:18 - blockchains as well so this process is
03:21 - what's known as mining it's the process
03:24 - of generating a valid block to be added
03:27 - to the ethereum blockchain now the node
03:29 - who successfully mines a block is going
03:32 - to be rewarded in ether
03:34 - so in this case it would be this node
03:36 - right here so this is why in the
03:38 - ethereum network we have a lot of nodes
03:40 - always trying to find that next block
03:42 - because if they can mine that first
03:45 - block again validate those transactions
03:47 - and solve the puzzle faster than all
03:49 - other nodes then they're going to be
03:51 - rewarded with ether so now that we
03:53 - understand the basics of how these
03:55 - transactions are validated how they're
03:57 - grouped into blocks and how those blocks
04:00 - are propagated throughout the network
04:01 - let's go ahead and take a closer look at
04:04 - one of these blockchains now before we
04:06 - dive into the blockchain architecture
04:08 - there are a couple things that i want to
04:09 - mention the first is that the fields and
04:12 - the exact data that i'm going to be
04:14 - talking about as part of each block it's
04:18 - not 100 technically correct there are a
04:21 - lot of additional fields mostly for
04:23 - security and validation purposes
04:26 - here we're taking a look at a very high
04:28 - level overview and also some of these
04:30 - things aren't technically correct for
04:32 - example there's not a field called
04:34 - solution in here so again this is more
04:36 - conceptual
04:37 - later on if we need to we'll take a look
04:39 - at the actual individual fields and
04:40 - break them down like we did for the
04:42 - transaction object earlier on but just
04:44 - want to point that out now that being
04:46 - said let's go ahead and add two more
04:48 - fields to our block and that is one
04:51 - block number
04:52 - and i don't think i really need to
04:55 - dwell and explain this too much you can
04:57 - kind of see that a block number is
04:59 - essentially well i don't even know how
05:01 - to how
05:02 - how else to explain it other than block
05:04 - number if you view these blocks as items
05:06 - in a list it's really just their
05:08 - positioning starting at zero so zero one
05:11 - two next one would be three so on and so
05:13 - forth
05:14 - now another field that is indeed in each
05:17 - block again this isn't just conceptual
05:19 - this is actual value in these blocks is
05:21 - a hash value of its parent block in my
05:24 - parent block i mean that the block that
05:26 - came before it
05:28 - so first
05:29 - this may seem kind of strange like why
05:32 - do we need to include a hash value of
05:33 - the entire block that came before it
05:35 - what's the point of that
05:37 - well the reason for this
05:39 - is actually related to the overall
05:40 - blockchain architecture by hashing the
05:43 - previous block and including that hash
05:45 - value in the subsequent block what this
05:47 - allows is for the entire blockchain to
05:50 - essentially maintain the order of which
05:53 - block came after each other in other
05:56 - words it's kind of like a big linked
05:57 - list and by hashing it you're
05:59 - essentially just maintaining the order
06:01 - of blocks in the blockchain so through
06:03 - this entire mining process or in other
06:06 - words the creation of the ethereum
06:08 - blockchain every single node in the
06:11 - network is able to reach consensus on
06:13 - each new block and ultimately
06:16 - the blockchain as a whole
06:18 - now a couple last things to point out
06:20 - the first is that not all nodes in the
06:23 - ethereum network are indeed miners
06:26 - miners are the nodes that are using
06:29 - their time and their computational
06:31 - resources to process transactions in an
06:34 - attempt to produce more blocks
06:37 - however there can be nodes and in fact
06:40 - there are in the ethereum network that
06:42 - aren't interested in mining or finding
06:44 - more blocks
06:45 - and an example of this is let's say that
06:47 - we had a node that just wanted to listen
06:50 - for incoming transactions maybe they had
06:52 - some like api service and they were
06:54 - providing data to people in that case
06:56 - they really aren't interested in finding
06:58 - new blocks they really just wanted to
07:00 - you know gather data be part of the
07:02 - network for those reasons so that would
07:04 - be example of an ethereum node that
07:06 - wasn't a miner in other words they
07:08 - weren't trying to solve any puzzle now
07:10 - the last thing i want to point out is
07:12 - that the ethereum network right now it
07:14 - uses a proof of work consensus mechanism
07:18 - and that is what we described right here
07:20 - by essentially solving this puzzle
07:22 - now on that note
07:24 - proof of work is actually being phased
07:26 - out of ethereum in favor of something
07:27 - called proof of stake and the reason for
07:30 - this well one of the primary reasons is
07:32 - that they want to decrease the amount of
07:33 - energy use because this process right
07:36 - here
07:37 - it actually requires a lot of energy so
07:40 - ethereum is transitioning over to a
07:42 - different consensus mechanism
07:44 - that will essentially get rid of this
07:46 - puzzle solving process and eliminate the
07:49 - need for proof of work so for now i
07:51 - think that puts us in a good position
07:53 - have a pretty solid understanding of
07:55 - blocks the blockchain architecture and
07:58 - really the mining process proof of work
08:00 - so on and so forth so for now thank you
08:02 - for watching don't forget to subscribe
08:04 - and i will see you in the next video
