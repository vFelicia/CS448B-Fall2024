00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to be taking a
00:07 - look at the has traversing uh function
00:10 - in jQuery and we're going to be
00:11 - searching a particular element for sub
00:14 - elements or children of that element and
00:16 - we're going to be using the unordered
00:18 - list as an example now I'm going to
00:20 - create an example that's more perhaps
00:22 - more relevant and we're going to use
00:24 - this in an if statement to check if a UL
00:26 - has any Li uh elements within it um and
00:30 - we're almost going to be creating it in
00:31 - the theme of a menu Builder so for
00:34 - example we're going to create a menu
00:37 - one and let's go ahead to our browser
00:39 - you can see that we've just got menu one
00:41 - there so we're going to be creating a
00:42 - menu one and the menu is going to be
00:44 - made up of UL and Li elements so for
00:48 - example we could have menu item one in
00:50 - here and that would produce something
00:52 - like this now let's go ahead and just go
00:54 - ahead uh let's just go ahead and style
00:56 - this uh quickly first of all uh so the
00:59 - uh UL is going to have padding of zero
01:04 - and
01:05 - margin of zero uh we'll just leave in
01:08 - the um well no it automatically gets rid
01:11 - of the uh the circle Graphics but there
01:14 - we go so we'll have uh a menu like this
01:17 - where we can go ahead and add more items
01:20 - so for example menu item
01:24 - two but what we want to happen is we
01:26 - want uh a default message to appear if
01:29 - if no liis exist within an unordered
01:33 - list so at the moment you just see
01:35 - nothing but I want a little message to
01:37 - uh appear under here that says uh there
01:40 - are no Lis and we searched this UL
01:42 - element for children uh elements of Li
01:45 - type so inside ext.js let's go ahead and
01:48 - just set up our document uh once it's
01:51 - ready so document. ready inside the
01:54 - function to be run when the document is
01:56 - ready uh now what we want to do is we
01:59 - want to use each to Loop through each Ur
02:02 - on the page because we might have say
02:04 - more than one menu uh so let's go ahead
02:06 - and use a selector and select uh ul and
02:10 - then we want to say do each so inside
02:12 - here we create we uh run a function for
02:15 - each LI or UL element on the page so for
02:19 - example we could
02:21 - say this do
02:24 - append a just as an example you can see
02:28 - that oh no a hasn't been appended so
02:30 - sorry that's this like this so uh you
02:34 - can see that a has been appended there
02:35 - if we go ahead and we create another
02:37 - menu so menu
02:41 - two you can see that a is again appended
02:44 - after here so let's just get rid of that
02:46 - for now we'll you know be showing an
02:48 - example a bit later so uh let's forget
02:50 - this line here what we want to do is for
02:53 - each uh UL element we want to uh first
02:56 - of all I'm going to create a variable
02:57 - called this selector um which is equal
03:00 - to this this just means that we don't
03:02 - have to keep using dollar sign and this
03:05 - and then what I want to do is create my
03:07 - if statement and my if statement is
03:09 - going to be or the condition is going to
03:11 - be if An Li element exists within um or
03:16 - if An Li element doesn't exist within
03:18 - some a u UL parent I want to go ahead
03:22 - and you know create the message empty
03:24 - menu so I say this selector dot has and
03:29 - this is where we're using has now and we
03:31 - can specify a particular um element in
03:34 - here like Li we can use also use a
03:36 - variety of other selectors so if you're
03:38 - using if you want to check has and want
03:41 - to check something like uh contains for
03:44 - example you can do uh just any selectors
03:46 - that are relevant to what you're doing
03:48 - will uh should work so we want to say uh
03:51 - do length which will return uh length
03:53 - and if that is equal to zero that means
03:56 - that An Li element doesn't exist within
03:58 - uh the current L that we're on That
04:00 - We're looping through so uh we're
04:02 - checking for Lis and if that equals zero
04:04 - we know that they don't so we can go
04:06 - ahead and say this cell.
04:10 - after empty menu so now what's going to
04:14 - happen is because we don't have any
04:15 - elements in here once we Loop through
04:17 - this uh UL we are checking if it has any
04:20 - Li we're returning the length which
04:22 - essentially will return um you know the
04:25 - length of how many it does have uh so
04:28 - for example if we had two it would would
04:29 - return a length of two um in this case
04:32 - we wouldn't run this line but if it did
04:34 - equal nothing which it does at the
04:35 - moment uh that is equal to nothing and
04:38 - therefore we uh return this line so when
04:41 - we refresh now you see that we've got
04:43 - empty menu now if we go ahead and
04:45 - actually create some Li elements in
04:48 - here so menu item one you can see that
04:52 - that will disappear and we'll have menu
04:54 - item one instead now I understand that
04:57 - this isn't really a you know relevant
04:58 - example in terms of actually um a
05:01 - website you might have because you'd be
05:03 - in control of the code however if you
05:05 - were creating some kind of plug-in that
05:07 - required Li elements to be within a UL
05:10 - uh parent you might actually want to
05:12 - include has to make sure that you know
05:15 - your plug-in is being structured
05:16 - properly on the front end uh so it's
05:18 - extremely useful in that sense uh I'll
05:21 - just go ahead and add another one to
05:23 - this and create another menu uh just so
05:25 - you can see so I'm going to create some
05:27 - empty UL tags there uh when I refresh
05:30 - we've got menu item one which has got uh
05:32 - menu one which has got menu item one and
05:34 - menu item two and menu two which is
05:36 - empty menu uh as soon as we then go
05:39 - ahead and add some more elements to this
05:41 - so Li
05:43 - Li menu item one you can see that that
05:46 - message again disappears so it's quite
05:49 - easy uh or useful for validation within
05:51 - like I said plug-in building if you're
05:54 - making someone you know follow a
05:56 - specific structure uh on the front end
05:59 - with regards ards to the HTML you might
06:01 - want to use has to double check this uh
06:03 - and maybe feedback some information to
06:06 - the user based on uh what the front end
06:08 - contains so that's quite a useful way of
06:11 - using it uh but for now that's the has
06:13 - uh function in jQuery
