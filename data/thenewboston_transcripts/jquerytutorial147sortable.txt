00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - looking at the sortable interaction in
00:09 - jQuery so we're going to be creating a
00:11 - list much like we did when we looked at
00:14 - the droppable tutorial or the droppable
00:18 - interaction in jQuery and we're going to
00:20 - allow this list to be sorted so we've
00:23 - included the jQuery UI a UI library as
00:26 - well as the original jQuery library and
00:29 - they also have a stylesheet here because
00:31 - I'm going to be styling my list that I'm
00:33 - going to be creating in just a moment
00:34 - now inside you ijs is where our jQuery
00:38 - code is going to go to actually make
00:40 - this particular list suitable so the
00:43 - first thing we want to do is create an
00:45 - unordered list so I'm going to create
00:46 - some ul tags and inside here give this a
00:49 - few options so we're going to have for
00:52 - example three elements of this here and
00:57 - I'm just going to type in a few names
01:02 - okay so now I need to give this UL a
01:05 - particular ID and this is going to be
01:08 - names now the reason I'm giving this a
01:10 - particular ID such as this and not list
01:14 - because we're going to be creating
01:16 - another list in a moment and allowing
01:18 - each list to interact with each other so
01:20 - being able to drag items from one list
01:23 - into another list so let's go ahead and
01:25 - preview this in our browser you can see
01:27 - whether we've got some indentation here
01:29 - with the bullet points I'm actually
01:31 - going to remove these so I'm going to go
01:33 - over to style dot CSS and I'm just going
01:36 - to style ul I'm going to set the padding
01:40 - to zero pixels I'm going to set the list
01:45 - style to none and I'm also going to go
01:50 - ahead and set the width of this just up
01:52 - here to 200 pixels because currently a
01:56 - list takes up the whole document so now
01:58 - it looks a bit like this and we want to
02:00 - go ahead and make it draggable straight
02:02 - away so I'll sort of all rather so each
02:05 - element will become draggable and the
02:07 - list will automatically be sortable so
02:10 - fundamentally we would go into our
02:13 - external javascript file which is you
02:14 - ijs and we need to use a selector to
02:18 - select this list which i've called names
02:20 - we then want to do a dot as we usually
02:23 - would and we need to make this sortable
02:26 - now this alone will make this list
02:28 - suitable however we're going to specify
02:30 - some options in a moment which allow us
02:32 - to create some better interaction and
02:36 - also connect it with our other list and
02:39 - we're also going to be looking at one
02:41 - event as well there are quite a few
02:42 - events for sortable but we're going to
02:45 - take a look at the update event a bit
02:47 - later so now we have the list it looks
02:50 - as normal however we can actually now
02:52 - sort the elements inside the list so
02:55 - just by appending on this sortable
02:56 - interaction we're now able to actually
02:59 - sort the list so let's go ahead and
03:02 - create some curly brackets and start to
03:04 - look at some of the options available in
03:06 - the source will interact interaction now
03:09 - containment is probably one of the most
03:11 - important
03:13 - if for example you had one list and you
03:15 - wanted the containment to be just within
03:17 - that particular list at the moment you
03:19 - can see I can drag elements across the
03:21 - rest of the page and we have no
03:23 - containment in place or the default
03:25 - containment in place so this is not
03:30 - really a problem but you often don't
03:32 - want elements to be dragged away from
03:35 - this list we want them to be just be
03:36 - dragged up and down so I'm going to go
03:39 - ahead and specify the containment option
03:41 - and I'm going to make this equal to
03:43 - parent and what this will do is it will
03:46 - only allow items to be sorted within
03:49 - this parent which is ul so let's go
03:52 - ahead and test this you can see that I
03:53 - can't actually drag them away and they
03:56 - are all a lot they're all aligned along
03:59 - the y axis so now that they're sorted
04:03 - you can see that we've got this problem
04:05 - here of when I pull this up it overlaps
04:08 - this and doesn't automatically sort the
04:10 - Billy Billy name below Ashley it can be
04:15 - a bit funny and you know not work very
04:17 - well in this case so we have another
04:20 - option which makes selection or sort
04:22 - ability a lot more natural and this is
04:25 - the tolerance so we specify the option
04:29 - tolerance and the most natural is
04:31 - pointer and what this will do is it will
04:33 - sort as soon as the pointer reaches the
04:36 - other element so now you can see that as
04:38 - soon as this just about overlaps here so
04:41 - as soon as my pointer reaches the other
04:42 - element it will automatically go ahead
04:45 - and sort it so it feels a lot more
04:47 - natural and if you try if you're trying
04:49 - this out for yourself you'll probably
04:51 - agree okay so let's go ahead and look at
04:54 - some other options some more aesthetic
04:56 - options the first one being cursor and
04:58 - this is just the cursor that's displayed
05:00 - when we're actually dragging a
05:02 - particular element now at the moment is
05:04 - just set to the default selection icon
05:07 - or cursor I'm going to go ahead and set
05:10 - this to pointer there are obviously a
05:13 - few other options but I prefer pointer
05:15 - because it gives us gives us this nice
05:16 - hand icon which sort of simulates
05:19 - actually moving something around
05:22 - so now that we've created it up to make
05:26 - it a look a bit better and we've added
05:29 - this pointer in we may want the list
05:32 - elements to revert once we've actually
05:34 - dropped them you can see at the moment
05:37 - if I don't quite drop this it snaps back
05:39 - to its original position if we were to
05:41 - change at the revert option to true this
05:45 - will actually allow it to sort of slide
05:48 - back to its original position you can
05:50 - see there now this works as well if you
05:53 - were to have the containment set to say
05:56 - document and if we were allowed to move
05:59 - these elements across the page for
06:01 - example over here you'll see it will
06:03 - revert back to its position so it won't
06:06 - revert back to its original position but
06:08 - it will revert back to the position
06:10 - associated with the drag and the the
06:13 - sort so for example if I move Billy over
06:15 - here and then pulled it down slightly
06:17 - you can see that there's a gap there and
06:19 - that would fit nicely in the gap and
06:21 - revert back to that position so revert
06:24 - works in that way in the sense that will
06:26 - revert it back to either its original
06:28 - position if it hasn't been moved or the
06:30 - position that's been moved to if it's
06:31 - not within that particular element or
06:34 - within the particular container okay so
06:37 - now we want to go ahead and look at the
06:40 - opacity option let me just pull these
06:43 - down so we can view them a bit better
06:45 - okay so the opacity option just
06:48 - specifies an opacity if you've seen the
06:50 - tutorial on dragging you'll know that we
06:53 - can also specify an opacity with
06:54 - dragging and I'm going to set this to
06:56 - naught point six zero and that's at
06:58 - sixty percent opacity so when I move it
07:00 - you can see it's changed now to a sixty
07:03 - percent opacity
