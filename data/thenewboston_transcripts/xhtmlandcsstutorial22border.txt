00:00 - all right guys welcome back to your 22nd
00:02 - xhtml and CSS tutorial and as promised
00:06 - I'm going to be talking to you guys
00:07 - about borders and I'm not talking about
00:09 - like the Mexican US border I'm talking
00:12 - about borders in CSS now as I mentioned
00:16 - before or at least I think I mentioned
00:17 - this before the border is the area that
00:20 - surrounds or basically it outlines the
00:23 - padding so what I did before this
00:26 - tutorial is I just set the overall
00:27 - padding to 15 pixels so we have the cont
00:30 - and we have 15 pixels of padding around
00:32 - it so now what I need to do is show you
00:36 - guys what a border is so let me make one
00:39 - of the ugliest borders ever I'm just
00:40 - going to make it stand out and I'm going
00:42 - to make like a red border or something
00:44 - so the Border you think you might just
00:46 - be able to type border and type a red
00:49 - but you can't just do that border
00:51 - actually has three properties that you
00:54 - need to set in order to make a border
00:56 - the first one is border color and let's
00:59 - just go ahead and and set the sequel to
01:00 - Red that should look pretty good and the
01:03 - second one is width how wide or thick do
01:06 - you want your border and that's border
01:08 - width and I'm just going to make mine
01:10 - like three pixels or something that'll
01:12 - be good enough and the last um excuse me
01:16 - the last element you need to set when
01:18 - working with the border is border style
01:21 - now I think by default it might be solid
01:23 - but let's see if I can remember there's
01:25 - dotted dashed um I think there's one
01:27 - called double Groove and inset outset um
01:33 - solid anyways you can look them up
01:35 - online if you forget them but let's go
01:36 - ahead and uh I'll add a simple one
01:39 - border minus
01:42 - style Dash and this gives you like
01:44 - dotted lines basically so now let's go
01:47 - ahead and save this and see what we get
01:49 - when we refresh this we get a red three
01:52 - pixels wide dashed border pretty cool
01:56 - huh so this kind of actually reminds me
01:58 - of a coupon that you would cut out out
02:00 - so if you're making a website with
02:02 - coupons coupons to love Bucky then uh
02:05 - you know there you go I just basically
02:07 - made it for you so that is basically how
02:10 - you do that and another cool thing I
02:12 - want to mention before I let you guys go
02:15 - is each side can have its own border so
02:18 - whenever you think of something with a
02:21 - border you typically think the border is
02:23 - consistent all the way around but
02:25 - sometimes when you're creating a website
02:27 - you want the top to be one thing or
02:29 - maybe you only want a border on the
02:31 - bottom like it's underlined in a cool
02:33 - type of way so you can do that using
02:35 - some special border properties and
02:37 - that's this say you want to change like
02:40 - the top or something you can use border
02:42 - minus top minus color and set this equal
02:45 - to like
02:47 - green that looks good and now what you
02:50 - can do is like put border minus top
02:53 - minus style and let's make this one
02:57 - dotted and now let's go ahead and uh oh
03:00 - yeah the width border minus top minus
03:04 - width and set this equal to like four
03:07 - pixels bump it up a little bit and if I
03:10 - didn't mess mess up anything I should
03:12 - get a nice dotted green four pixel
03:15 - border across the top so this looks
03:18 - pretty ugly right now but trust me if
03:20 - you work with it I mean uh most people
03:22 - just use this when they want to
03:24 - underline something like if it's like
03:26 - the uh title of a paragraph or title of
03:29 - article or or something but I just
03:31 - wanted to show you guys a quick example
03:32 - so I made the ugliest web SL I could
03:34 - possibly make but anyways um I showed
03:37 - you guys how to do that on the top but
03:39 - if you just replace this word top with
03:41 - bottom left or right then you guys can
03:44 - see the other effects that it can have
03:45 - I'm not going to go through bottom left
03:47 - and right because it's obviously it's
03:49 - obvious what it would do so anyways that
03:52 - is how you make a border whether you
03:54 - want it consistent you just write border
03:56 - minus the property or if you want it on
03:59 - one side you write border minus what
04:02 - side you want minus the property and
04:04 - then write the value so
04:05 - anyways that's basically all there is to
04:08 - borders um nothing else I can think of
04:11 - so anyways thank you guys for watching
04:13 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
04:14 - you next tutorial where we're probably
04:16 - going to be covering margins so I'll see
