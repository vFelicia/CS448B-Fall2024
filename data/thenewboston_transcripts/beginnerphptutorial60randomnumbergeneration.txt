00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - and this is another video for the new
00:05 - Boston now at some point when you
00:08 - program in
00:10 - PHP you are going to need to Generate
00:12 - random numbers now the first thing I'm
00:15 - going to do is show you how to generate
00:16 - a random number how we can specify a
00:19 - lower and an upper limit and then I'm
00:21 - going to talk a bit about why you might
00:22 - need to uh specif oh generate a random
00:26 - number so when we use the Rand function
00:30 - which looks like this we can either
00:33 - Supply no arguments at all or we can
00:36 - supply two arguments now we're first of
00:39 - all going to look at supplying no
00:41 - argument so if I was to just Echo Rand
00:44 - or in fact create a variable called Rand
00:47 - that we can use later on in our program
00:50 - then um now random number in PHP is
00:53 - automatically seeded so there's no need
00:55 - to do anything all you have to actually
00:57 - do is call Rand now at the moment
01:01 - because we haven't supplied arguments
01:03 - this is going to uh generate a random
01:05 - number between a minimum and a maximum
01:08 - amount and the minimum amount is I think
01:11 - Z or 1 and the maximum is a
01:13 - pre-specified amount so let's just take
01:16 - a look at the preview of this in our
01:18 - browser you can see that we've now
01:19 - generated
01:22 - 3,150 now
01:24 - 10,631 180 so we're going lower towards
01:27 - the lower limit back up to the higher Li
01:29 - limits and we can keep refreshing and
01:31 - we'll have a random number now this
01:34 - isn't unique so every time you refresh
01:36 - it will automatically recede and we will
01:39 - be um we will be uh generating perhaps
01:43 - the same number twice
01:46 - now um if I was to uh look at this I can
01:52 - see that there's obviously an upper
01:53 - limit because we're not going into say
01:55 - the millions but there is a way we can
01:59 - find out this up a value uh so if I say
02:02 - Max equals and it's a get Rand Max
02:05 - function now what this will do is this
02:07 - will um specify the maximum amount of uh
02:13 - the maximum integer that this random
02:16 - value can be when we've specified just
02:18 - Rand on its own so let's uh put forward
02:22 - slash in there and then Max so
02:24 - essentially what we're seeing is the
02:26 - random number out of the maximum so
02:29 - let's have a look at what that's
02:30 - produced you can see now we've got
02:32 - 9552 out of
02:36 - 32,767
02:39 - 32,767 in this case is the maximum
02:41 - number that can be generated and the
02:44 - number that has been generated is 9552
02:47 - so you'll see that as we uh refresh this
02:49 - value will stay the same however the
02:52 - random number that's being generated
02:53 - will uh will uh sort of increase
02:56 - decrease and change so what what happens
03:00 - if we don't want to use all this and we
03:02 - just want to Echo out a random number
03:04 - between a specific amount let's say you
03:07 - creating a dice game where you user had
03:10 - to roll a dice randomly so I'm going to
03:13 - come down here and I'm going to create a
03:15 - form and the action is going to be uh
03:19 - this current
03:22 - page uh which is index.php and the
03:25 - method is going to be post and what I'm
03:27 - going to do is I'm simply going to
03:28 - create one button
03:30 - and that's uh a submit button with the
03:33 - name
03:34 - roll and the
03:37 - value roll a dice or is it d
03:42 - uh I'm not too sure what say roll dice
03:46 - it's uh irrelevant here okay so inside
03:50 - PHP let's just get rid of all this for
03:52 - now we want to first of all check if
03:54 - this button has been pressed this is
03:55 - something by now you probably should
03:57 - know how to do so we're saying if is set
04:00 - dollar poost remember we're using a post
04:02 - variable here
04:05 - um
04:07 - roll and uh oh that's it actually that's
04:11 - all we need to do because we're clicking
04:12 - a button so if uh the button has been
04:16 - clicked we can say clicked just to uh
04:19 - test this for now
04:21 - clicked okay so let's uh refresh our
04:24 - page we can click on this and it will
04:26 - come up with click so you sort of get
04:28 - the idea of where this is going what
04:30 - we're going to do is we're going to
04:31 - generate a random number between 1 and
04:33 - six when we press this because a dice
04:36 - has six sides
04:38 - so let's um create a new variable called
04:42 - Rand and we'll call that equal that to
04:44 - Rand now we're going to Echo
04:47 - out u r a and then we're going to append
04:52 - on this random number now as it stands
04:55 - at the moment we have um clicking the
04:57 - button it's giving us a massive number
05:00 - which is irrelevant to a dice so the
05:03 - program is pointless however if I was to
05:06 - specify just two arguments in here we
05:08 - can specify a minimum and a maximum or a
05:10 - lower and an upper limit limit so we can
05:13 - say between 1 and
05:16 - six now so I've said one for the first
05:18 - argument six for the second now this is
05:20 - an inclusive value so we could we could
05:24 - be echoing a one we could be echoing a
05:26 - six but we're not going to be echoing
05:27 - anything less than a one or anything
05:29 - more than a six and obviously the
05:31 - numbers in between so let's have a look
05:33 - here let's
05:34 - refresh at the moment it says you rolled
05:36 - a four we can click it again you rolled
05:38 - a two you rolled a six you rolled a four
05:41 - you roll a three a one so we've pretty
05:43 - much had every value and we could keep
05:45 - clicking that and it will never go over
05:46 - six and it will never be under
05:48 - one so that is one um fun use if you
05:53 - like for the random function now what
05:54 - are the other reasons we might use it
05:57 - now when we're uploading files we might
05:59 - want to specify ify a random um a random
06:03 - uh array of if you like of um numbers
06:08 - and characters and letters and things
06:10 - like that anything really now the random
06:13 - function is really useful because it's
06:14 - going to produce a more or less random
06:16 - value every time which you can combine
06:19 - with other random values and letters of
06:21 - your choice and even md5 hashes which
06:24 - you can look at on one of my other
06:26 - videos so the random function is great
06:29 - for doing what it says and if you do
06:31 - need to use a random function all you
06:33 - need to do is call Rand you can specify
06:35 - a lower and an upper limit a minimum a
06:38 - maximum limit if you'd like to call it
06:39 - that or you can just leave it blank and
06:42 - you uh will be generating a number with
06:45 - a predefined upper limit so that's the
06:48 - random function in PHP
