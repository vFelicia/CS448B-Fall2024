00:00 - welcome back y'all to another tutorial
00:03 - and in this video we are going to be
00:05 - talking about how to listen for edited
00:08 - messages and also reactions because who
00:11 - doesn't love reactions
00:13 - all right now the first thing i want to
00:15 - mention is i did create the
00:18 - new file for this tutorial number two
00:20 - reactions and edits and i basically just
00:22 - copied the first file
00:24 - and removed some of the stuff so anyways
00:27 - we just have the on ready function
00:30 - because i like to have a little status
00:31 - to print out to say when the spot is
00:33 - ready and then just that little check to
00:35 - make sure that our bot isn't responding
00:38 - to its own messages and yeah just want
00:40 - to give you guys that starting point
00:42 - so now what we want to do is go ahead
00:45 - and talk about how to listen for edited
00:47 - messages
00:48 - so
00:49 - due to laziness i'm going to be copying
00:52 - that little snippet
00:53 - and all right so instead of on message
00:56 - this event is called on message edit
01:00 - now instead of taking in a single
01:02 - message
01:04 - what this passes in is actually the
01:06 - before message and the after message
01:11 - so
01:12 - for this what i'm going to do is just to
01:14 - show you guys the
01:16 - you know basically just how it works i
01:18 - am going to be sending back the message
01:20 - that they originally sent and then the
01:23 - new version of the message
01:25 - so it's the same concept as before
01:28 - however remember
01:29 - whenever we are sending a message from
01:31 - the bot we have to specify what channel
01:34 - it's being sent on
01:35 - and since this has two messages we
01:37 - actually just need to pick one so
01:40 - we can just say the before channel or in
01:43 - other words the original message channel
01:46 - so before.channel.send
01:49 - what we're going to be doing and we can
01:50 - use the fstring for this
01:54 - is we can say
01:56 - do a little pepe clean up here
01:58 - is that
02:00 - the author
02:03 - and we can say edited a
02:06 - message and then on the next line we can
02:09 - just say what it was before or in other
02:12 - words the original message
02:13 - so before dot content
02:16 - and on the last line we can just say
02:18 - after
02:20 - after dot
02:22 - content and actually before i run this
02:24 - this should be content not
02:27 - content
02:29 - and all right that looks good go so let
02:30 - me go ahead and run this
02:33 - and once it pops online there we go
02:36 - so now i can write something like i love
02:39 - beefcake
02:40 - hit enter and omg what a terrible
02:43 - mistake what i meant to write was i love
02:45 - cheesecake
02:47 - and all right our bot
02:49 - recognizes that i edited that message
02:51 - and it prints out bucky in my full
02:54 - username edited a message or edit a
02:56 - message there's a little typo there
02:58 - before i love beefcake after i love
03:00 - cheesecake
03:01 - and this is a cool way where you can
03:03 - make sure that no user on your discord
03:05 - server can ever live down any of their
03:07 - mistakes whenever they have a typo it
03:09 - just really uh embarrasses them in the
03:12 - biggest way possible kidding of course
03:15 - but this is actually useful because
03:17 - whenever you are writing a discord bot
03:19 - you usually want to make this of course
03:21 - event based in other words whenever a
03:23 - user writes something you want your bot
03:25 - to respond in a certain kind of way
03:27 - however the tricky part about this is
03:29 - that users can actually change their
03:31 - messages in other words edit their
03:33 - messages
03:34 - so whenever this happens you want your
03:36 - bot to typically be behave in a very
03:38 - specific way and that's the usefulness
03:41 - of this why i decided to set aside some
03:42 - time making a tutorial on this but now
03:46 - that we understand the basics of
03:48 - handling edited messages of course with
03:50 - the before and after messages let's go
03:52 - ahead and move on to something a bit
03:54 - more interesante i think that means
03:57 - interesting in some kind of language but
03:59 - who knows
04:00 - all right so the first thing that i'm
04:03 - going to want to do is let's say
04:05 - whenever
04:06 - the user types the word cool
04:09 - that we are going to add a reaction for
04:11 - the sunglasses
04:13 - so this one right here
04:15 - so whenever we want to be adding a
04:17 - reaction
04:19 - what i typically do is just see if i can
04:22 - pop open chrome right here i just type
04:24 - in emojis to unicode and click on one of
04:27 - the first you know links that pops up
04:30 - so
04:30 - what i'm going to search for is sun
04:33 - glasses
04:35 - and i'm just going to copy this unicode
04:38 - and i'll show you guys how to convert
04:40 - this so you can use it in your function
04:41 - later on but make sure you copy some
04:43 - kind of reaction that you want
04:45 - now on this on message what we can do is
04:48 - we saw this before whenever the user
04:50 - said hello and we responded with welcome
04:52 - to the new boston we're going to follow
04:54 - the same pattern if message.content
04:57 - equals
04:58 - cool
04:59 - so whenever a user types cool what we
05:02 - want to do is just add a reaction to
05:04 - that message so we're going to await
05:06 - message dot
05:08 - add reaction
05:11 - and remember we're just going to paste
05:13 - in
05:14 - that unicode that we saw on the website
05:16 - right here
05:18 - so it was u plus 1f60e
05:22 - now whenever you actually use this in
05:24 - python you have to convert this plus to
05:26 - a triple zero
05:29 - and you also have to escape this u kind
05:31 - of annoying but
05:33 - you know python unicode not the uh best
05:35 - of friends as i'm sure a lot of you guys
05:38 - know so anyways
05:39 - uh the meat and potatoes of this is that
05:41 - whenever a user writes cool we are just
05:44 - gonna have our bot respond with our
05:46 - sunglasses reaction
05:48 - so now let me go ahead and rerun this
05:51 - wait for it to come online
05:54 - and all right so just to make sure we
05:56 - can say uh apples
05:58 - okay bacon
06:01 - okay now let's go ahead and write cool
06:03 - and our bot is gonna respond with this
06:06 - we see tutorials bot reacted with
06:08 - sunglasses
06:09 - very cool
06:11 - pun intended of course
06:12 - all right so now we saw okay this is how
06:16 - your bot can add a reaction people's
06:18 - messages but what if we want our bot to
06:20 - listen for when other people add
06:22 - reactions and maybe we can inspect them
06:24 - and do something later but for right now
06:26 - we'll just say let's listen for when a
06:28 - user added a reaction to any message and
06:31 - just print something out in the uh in
06:34 - the channel
06:36 - so of course due to epic laziness i'm
06:39 - just going to go ahead and copy that
06:41 - little snippet in the client event for
06:43 - this is on
06:45 - reaction ad
06:47 - now
06:48 - what discord passes in whenever this
06:50 - event is triggered is the reaction
06:54 - and the user who left the reaction
06:58 - so the reaction itself is just think of
07:00 - it like the emoji it has some other
07:02 - information as well but you can just
07:03 - think of it as the emoji and the user is
07:06 - of course the author of it so what we
07:08 - can do is we can just say like bucky
07:10 - reacted with sunglasses or bucky reacted
07:13 - with thumbs up whatever we want to say
07:16 - so in order to find the channel to send
07:18 - the message we can actually pull this
07:20 - from the reaction object
07:22 - so
07:23 - what i'm going to be doing is saying for
07:25 - the reaction we want to get the message
07:28 - that they left the reaction on
07:30 - and we want to get the channel from that
07:32 - since we always need to specify a
07:34 - channel of where we are sending the
07:36 - message
07:37 - so of course on the message object it
07:39 - comes with the channel object and we're
07:41 - just calling the send function from that
07:44 - and we can use f strings again
07:47 - and we can just say something simple
07:48 - like the user in other words it was the
07:51 - person who um left the reaction
07:54 - reacted with
07:57 - and then for the reaction
07:59 - the emoji is just
08:03 - the property emoji
08:05 - so if bucky is gonna leave sunglasses
08:08 - it's gonna say user reacted with
08:09 - sunglasses emoji
08:11 - but it's probably just easier if we take
08:13 - a look at this
08:15 - so let me just
08:17 - make one of my own messages i'll say
08:19 - hello
08:21 - just so we have a message to react to
08:23 - and i'm gonna thumbs up this and it says
08:25 - bucky reacted with thumbs up and let me
08:28 - go ahead and um
08:31 - what's another one uh what about this
08:33 - mustache dude okay bucky reacted with
08:36 - mustache dude and there you go
08:38 - so again not that interesting right here
08:41 - but there are actually some pretty cool
08:42 - stuff that you can do
08:44 - with these reactions if you guys ever
08:46 - saw like voting system or polls or you
08:48 - click your reaction and then you get a
08:50 - specific type of role it isn't just
08:52 - printing out who left what reaction
08:54 - because of course you can just see that
08:56 - above
08:57 - but there you go these are some of the
09:00 - core building blocks for a lot of
09:01 - discord bots
09:03 - so editing messages
09:05 - looking how we work with the
09:07 - a bunch of cool stuff going on here but
09:09 - for now and that is all we get for this
09:11 - tutorial so thank you guys for watching
09:13 - don't forget to subscribe and i will see
09:15 - you guys later
