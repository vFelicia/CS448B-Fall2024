00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 41st
00:02 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
00:04 - to be teaching you guys about some
00:05 - different types of inputs because you
00:07 - know sometimes you just want to user to
00:09 - enter a unique piece of information like
00:12 - their name or the address but other
00:14 - times you're going to want to have the
00:16 - user select from like a preset list like
00:20 - when they say pick what sex you are you
00:23 - want to give them the choice of male or
00:25 - female you don't want to have them enter
00:27 - something weird so you're just going to
00:29 - give them set choices so there are times
00:31 - for them to input text and times for
00:33 - them to select from a list so I'm going
00:36 - to show you guys how to do that right
00:37 - now and you make a list in one of two
00:40 - different types of ways actually one of
00:41 - three but we're going to be talking
00:43 - about two in this tutorial for example
00:45 - let's go ahead and take that male and
00:47 - female example I was just talking about
00:49 - and male female and in the male what
00:53 - we're going to do first is we want to
00:55 - give them two choices either male or
00:58 - female we don't want allow them to
01:00 - select male and female because you know
01:03 - not too many people are male and female
01:05 - a few but not too many so the first
01:08 - thing we need to do is first of all
01:11 - we're going to do a different type of
01:12 - input other than text we need to add
01:15 - something called a radio button a radio
01:17 - button is pretty much a bunch of buttons
01:20 - but you can only select one of the
01:22 - buttons so let's go ahead and I'll show
01:24 - you how to do that right now input type
01:27 - instead of text put radio and I think
01:29 - this term comes from the old radios
01:31 - where you had to press buttons on them
01:33 - instead of you know digitalized or
01:35 - whatever it's called and
01:37 - anyways aside from that type you also
01:40 - need a name and the name of this is
01:42 - going to be sex or something and you
01:45 - need a name because if you have a bunch
01:47 - of different radio buttons and you have
01:49 - you know maybe a group of buttons for
01:51 - what sex you are and a group of buttons
01:53 - for your favorite food and a group of
01:55 - buttons for what band you like it knows
01:57 - how to group them together so group all
01:59 - your buttons under the same name and the
02:01 - last one is what value you want to give
02:04 - it and most of these um most of these
02:07 - attributes you don't really understand
02:09 - until you start understanding you know
02:12 - something like JavaScript or PHP or how
02:14 - to you know computer programming where
02:16 - you have to take this information and do
02:18 - something with it but anyways you need a
02:20 - value because later on whenever you're
02:23 - programming this data and putting it
02:25 - into a database or something you need to
02:27 - know what these things are so if there's
02:29 - ever something that doesn't quite make
02:31 - sense that's because you don't
02:33 - understand JavaScript yet or maybe you
02:34 - do and you know then it'll make sense so
02:37 - anyways this is one button but let's go
02:40 - ahead and add another button right here
02:43 - just go ahead and paste that and give it
02:45 - a different value all your buttons need
02:47 - to have different values even though
02:48 - they have the same name remember that
02:51 - same type same name different values
02:53 - that's how they differentiate each other
02:55 - so let's go ahead and save that and see
02:56 - what we got we now have two radio
02:59 - buttons one right here and one right
03:01 - here with the same name and since they
03:02 - are the same name our browser knows that
03:05 - they're in the same group so to group
03:07 - them together and you can only let the
03:09 - user select one so when they select this
03:11 - the other one comes unselected when they
03:13 - select this the other one comes
03:15 - unselected so you're saying that's
03:16 - pretty cool now I understand radio
03:18 - buttons but what if there comes across a
03:21 - scenario where I want to let the user
03:23 - select more than one thing for example
03:25 - if you're making like a website
03:28 - selling um selling Meats online yes meat
03:32 - like bacon and stuff well you're going
03:34 - to want to allow the user to select more
03:37 - than one thing so for example let's go
03:39 - ahead and add a new line
03:42 - break and let's go ahead and add a
03:46 - paragraph and insert mess that up okay
03:51 - now let's go ahead and ask him a
03:52 - question
03:54 - like select the foods wow I can't type
03:58 - today that
04:00 - okay take a break deep breath learn to
04:04 - type select the foods that you would
04:06 - like to order and explanation point
04:10 - because we really want to rub it in
04:11 - their eyes all right so now we're going
04:13 - to give them a huge list of foods but we
04:16 - don't want to allow them to only select
04:18 - one because how are we ever going to
04:20 - grow our business if we can only s and
04:22 - sell one food at a time we want to give
04:24 - them a huge list and give them the
04:26 - option of either selecting none all of
04:28 - them or you know know somewhere in
04:30 - between so in order to do that we need a
04:32 - different type of input and this is
04:34 - called a checkbox a checkbox is pretty
04:36 - much a lot like radio buttons but you
04:38 - can check as many as you can either one
04:41 - all of them two three four however many
04:44 - so it doesn't unselect them
04:46 - automatically like a radio button so
04:47 - let's go ahead and first add some foods
04:49 - making ham tuna and soda pop even though
04:53 - soda pop isn't really a food hey for
04:55 - this website I'm selling it who the heck
04:57 - cares so let's go ahead and for the
05:00 - input
05:03 - type it is get out of the way cursor for
05:07 - the type it's
05:09 - checkbox and this is going to give you a
05:11 - little box that you can check H how neat
05:14 - is that and for the name let's name all
05:16 - of these food so anyways all of these
05:19 - types will be named food so food food
05:22 - food food just like before the name's
05:24 - the same the only difference is the
05:27 - value is different so for example
05:30 - this one is going to have the value of
05:31 - bacon and let me go ahead and end that
05:34 - before I forget and let's just go ahead
05:35 - and copy this four times because I'm way
05:37 - too lazy to type all this out so this
05:40 - one is going to be the exact same except
05:42 - this one's going to have the value of
05:44 - ham this one's going to have the value
05:46 - of tuna and this one's going to have the
05:48 - value of soda and now let's go ahead and
05:51 - save it and see what we get now it says
05:54 - select the feuds that you would like to
05:55 - order well instead of just having a
05:57 - radio button where they can only select
05:59 - one one now they can select one two
06:03 - three or four so how cool is that so now
06:07 - we have the different types of lists
06:08 - where you can either give them one
06:10 - choice or you can give them many choices
06:13 - and also we have our old trusty reliable
06:16 - text box so anyways now we learn a
06:18 - little more about forms and we're ready
06:20 - to move on to the next type of input and
06:23 - probably I'm going to be teaching you a
06:25 - different in the last type of list which
06:27 - is a drop down list but I don't know yet
06:29 - hey what do I look like a fortune teller
06:32 - so anyways thank you guys for watching
06:33 - this tutorial and uh I guess I'll see
06:35 - you next time
