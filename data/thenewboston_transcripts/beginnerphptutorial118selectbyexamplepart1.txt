00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - back with another video for the new
00:04 - Boston now we've already looked at
00:06 - selecting data from our database and we
00:08 - did this using the code here if you
00:10 - haven't already looked at the previous
00:12 - tutorial that explains this code and
00:13 - you're not comfortable looking at this
00:15 - code and understanding what it does I
00:17 - suggest you go back and view that
00:19 - tutorial as well as if you haven't
00:21 - looked at the general tutorial on
00:23 - queries and using MySQL then I recommend
00:28 - you view them as well now what we've
00:30 - done here is we've selected a specific
00:32 - field names from this table called food
00:35 - where unhealthy equals u and calories
00:38 - equals zip r700 so we've been quite
00:40 - specific and in this case we've only
00:43 - retrieved one value that's the icecream
00:45 - value here with the ID of four now what
00:49 - we want to do is be able to take user
00:50 - input in order to return specific values
00:54 - so let's say I want the user to be able
00:57 - to specify if they want a list of
00:59 - unhealthy food or healthy food or maybe
01:02 - if they want to specify a maximum or
01:05 - minimum calorie amount but for now we're
01:07 - just going to go for the unhealthy
01:08 - healthy food option and then the rest of
01:11 - that will be self explanatory for your
01:13 - own purposes so we're going to keep the
01:15 - code we've already got here let's just
01:19 - tidy this up a bit so it's a bit more
01:22 - combined
01:23 - [Music]
01:27 - if I will separate it just so it's
01:29 - easier to view okay so what we now want
01:32 - to do is take user input so we want to
01:34 - come down here or in fact up to the top
01:36 - we could do let's just cut off this
01:38 - require here and reopen a tag there for
01:42 - the rest of the PHP and we can put our
01:44 - HTML in here now I'm going to create a
01:47 - form and that's going to have an action
01:50 - of the page that we're going the world
01:52 - at the moment and the method is going to
01:54 - be get just so we can see what's going
01:58 - on in the URL bar at the top because
02:01 - eventually what we're going to be aiming
02:02 - for is something like Ronnie index dot
02:05 - PHP
02:06 - I want to aim for something like you H
02:11 - equals you for unhealthy or H for
02:14 - healthy so we're using this get variable
02:17 - here to specify a value so what we want
02:21 - to do is we want to create a field and
02:24 - I'm going to say I'm going to create a
02:27 - select field and this is going to be
02:32 - called an you H and and inside we're
02:38 - going to have our option so we need
02:39 - option we're going to have a first
02:41 - option and we're going to have a second
02:45 - option
02:47 - and these options are unhealthy or
02:54 - healthy I can spell it correctly so
02:57 - option value equals we'll just say you
03:02 - and option value equals H so now let's
03:07 - create a submit button we'll go down a
03:09 - couple of lines and say input type
03:12 - equals submit and the value of that can
03:18 - just be a submit so that's what's being
03:21 - displayed to the user and we'll add
03:23 - something that's a bit more
03:24 - user-friendly so choose a food type I
03:28 - guess that would be fine
03:30 - okay so let's um let's first of all okay
03:36 - we'll leave that for now so let's press
03:38 - f5 and choose a food type and unhealthy
03:41 - or healthy now ignore this for now
03:43 - because in the PHP code we've got a
03:45 - static a quit a static query which we
03:48 - which we predefined
03:50 - so ignore this for now but eventually
03:52 - what our form will do is it will produce
03:54 - a list of foods depending on what the
03:56 - user selects here so now what we're
03:58 - doing is as well as creating our query
04:00 - we're allowing the user to specify
04:02 - things that they want to return this is
04:04 - really useful in today applications so
04:08 - I'm going to click on unhealthy and
04:09 - click submit and you can see that up
04:11 - here we've got you h equals u and here
04:15 - we can say healthy click Submit u H
04:18 - equals H so it was we're processing get
04:22 - data through to the URL and then we can
04:25 - process that in our query so how do we
04:28 - do this well the first thing we need to
04:30 - do is inside our PHP here we need to
04:33 - check if these values have been
04:35 - submitted so I'm going to say if is set
04:40 - dollar underscore get u H then proceed
04:46 - with all of this code here and then what
04:49 - we can do is indent everything we've
04:51 - already got inside just so it looks a
04:53 - lot nicer
04:54 - so in them that so if is set get
04:58 - you H and not empty dollar underscore
05:09 - get you H now what we can do is we can
05:13 - say you H equals dollar underscore get
05:17 - you H now let's um let's kill the script
05:23 - there and echo this out so we know we
05:27 - can we're basically testing for this
05:30 - being submitted
05:31 - so we'll refresh the page back to
05:33 - index.php okay so we've got nothing
05:35 - there now as we've killed the page
05:36 - choose a food type unhealthy or healthy
05:39 - so let's select unhealthy first and we
05:41 - should be submitted and a you here for
05:43 - unhealthy and now healthy submit and
05:47 - we've got an H there okay so now what we
05:51 - can do is we can insert this value
05:53 - that's selected into our query to allow
05:56 - the query to become more dynamic and
05:59 - select the food type either whether
06:02 - unhealthy or healthy depending on the
06:04 - users input now before we start this
06:07 - there is a problem that we do have here
06:09 - and we have a potential for SQL
06:12 - injection and I have a video on SQL
06:15 - injection in this new book for this
06:19 - series for the new Boston so have a look
06:21 - at that video before you run anything
06:24 - like this on a live web server because
06:27 - you'll tend to find that queries can be
06:29 - modified using data so for example if I
06:33 - was submitting this this H value here is
06:37 - eventually going to go into a query so I
06:39 - could change this to something it
06:43 - wouldn't be select star but just for
06:45 - example I could change that so we can
06:47 - input different things into our query
06:49 - that doesn't make sense now it will do
06:51 - in a moment so input equals H that's a
06:57 - good point actually let's also make this
07:00 - our STR all know maybe this STR to lower
07:05 - so it always converting this to
07:07 - lowercase in case people try to modify
07:10 - the URL and
07:11 - anything like that
