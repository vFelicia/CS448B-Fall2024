00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at nested loops now if you
00:10 - remember back a couple tutorials we
00:12 - learned about if statements and that how
00:14 - you can nest if statements inside of
00:16 - each other so we're in the if statement
00:19 - case both of the values have to be true
00:21 - for it to run now it's a little
00:23 - different for for loops but the concept
00:25 - is still the same so let's go ahead and
00:27 - make a demo project for it so we'll go
00:30 - to new project and we will call this
00:35 - nested loops now we can also nest do
00:40 - until loops we can nest do-while loops
00:42 - there's a lot of stuff in Visual Basic
00:44 - that you can nest inside of each other
00:47 - so let's go ahead and zoom in here so
00:52 - let's go ahead and create a for loop so
00:56 - for number one equals one two let's just
01:00 - go ten then go ahead and do the code
01:03 - that is inside of this for loop so let's
01:06 - come down here and after our next we'll
01:09 - go ahead and add console dot readline
01:11 - okay so now inside of our for loop we're
01:14 - going to add another for loop so for
01:18 - num2 num2 equals one to ten
01:24 - go ahead and console dot write line and
01:30 - we'll just write line num2 so what this
01:36 - is what this is going to do is the first
01:39 - time this for loop runs it's going to
01:41 - print out one two three four five six
01:44 - seven eight nine ten and then it's going
01:46 - to go back to the top it's going to
01:47 - print it out again so what I mean by
01:49 - this is if we run this we get
01:55 - one two three four five six seven eight
01:57 - nine ten and it does this ten times so
02:00 - we have 100 integer values here printed
02:03 - out on our screen now let's go ahead and
02:05 - organize this a little bit better so
02:08 - instead of using console dot write line
02:10 - let's just go ahead and use console dot
02:12 - write and you can see here that it will
02:16 - print one two three four five six seven
02:19 - eight nine ten and it goes through this
02:20 - now this isn't very nice-looking either
02:24 - so there's one more thing that we can do
02:26 - to kind of clean this up and make a grid
02:30 - out of the numbers that we have so
02:33 - inside of our first for loop will just
02:35 - do console dot write line so I'll go
02:39 - ahead and run this and then explain to
02:40 - you how this code works so you can see
02:42 - that it's got one two three four five
02:44 - six seven eight nine ten
02:45 - it goes down to the line below it and
02:47 - this is a 10 by 10 grid so there's 100
02:50 - integer values on this grid okay so now
02:56 - basically what happens when we create
02:58 - this for loop is we have for number 1
03:01 - equals 1 to 10 and every time this is
03:08 - this for loop is iterated it iterates
03:11 - this for loop right here so starting off
03:13 - num1 is equal to 1
03:15 - it's going to do 1 to 10 it's going to
03:18 - console dot right and it's going to have
03:20 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then after this
03:24 - outside of this for loop which is all by
03:27 - itself it's going to do console dot
03:29 - write line inside of this for loop
03:30 - so it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then
03:35 - down the line and it goes back up to the
03:37 - top and it does that again and it's
03:38 - going to do that ten times to give us a
03:41 - grid now we can also do this with like I
03:46 - said do Wiles and do 1 2 loops on so I'm
03:49 - going to leave it up to you guys to
03:50 - figure out how to do that with your do
03:52 - loops and once you practice that a bit
03:55 - go ahead and move on to the next
03:57 - tutorial and thanks for watching
