00:00 - ok today we're going to be talking about
00:03 - classifying triangles by angles and
00:06 - there's four types of triangles
00:10 - first there's the acute triangle and
00:14 - like the name suggests it's a triangle
00:17 - with three acute angles and remember an
00:23 - acute angle is just an angle who is
00:31 - greater than zero degrees and less than
00:35 - ninety degrees okay next we have the
00:43 - obtuse triangle and it has one obtuse
00:46 - angle and for this one that is right
00:50 - here and an obtuse angle is just an
00:56 - angle who is greater than 90 degrees but
01:03 - less than 180 degrees our fourth our
01:11 - third type of triangle is a right
01:13 - triangle and it has one right angle
01:15 - right here now a right angle is an angle
01:22 - whose measure is equal to 90 degrees and
01:26 - there's two ways you're gonna notice
01:29 - either they're gonna tell you that it's
01:32 - a right angle or there's gonna be a
01:34 - little square right here to indicate
01:36 - that it's a right angle you can't just
01:40 - think it looks like a right angle and
01:42 - say it's a right angle you have to be
01:44 - told that it is a right angle now our
01:49 - fourth kind of triangle is an
01:53 - equilateral triangle and like a
01:58 - equilateral triangle whose sides are
02:02 - congruent all their angles are also
02:07 - congruent
02:10 - so this symbol just means congruent and
02:15 - when we are congruent the angles have
02:23 - equal measure so we can mark this by do
02:30 - making we can mark them as congruent by
02:34 - doing this these little tick marks
02:37 - indicate that it's these angles are
02:40 - congruent okay so now we're going to do
02:44 - an example we have triangle ABC and
02:50 - triangle BCD and because the triangles
02:56 - are already marked we know that these
02:59 - three angles are congruent so since the
03:05 - measure of angle BCA is equal to 60
03:10 - degrees an angle BCA angle C a B and
03:18 - angle ABC are all congruent we know that
03:26 - the measure of angle C a B is also 60
03:31 - degrees and the measure of angle ABC is
03:37 - 60 degrees as well so this is 60 and
03:44 - this is 60 so that makes triangle ABC
03:53 - and equilateral
04:00 - and acute triangle because all three
04:07 - angles are equal and all three angles
04:10 - are less than 90 degrees so we want to
04:14 - find out what kind of triangle triangle
04:17 - B DC is this triangle right here well if
04:23 - you look at these two angles right here
04:26 - you'll notice that they're supplementary
04:28 - angles so we can add 60 plus we're gonna
04:34 - call this angle angle X plus X and we're
04:38 - going to set that equal to 180 to find
04:40 - out how big x equals so if we subtract
04:44 - 60 we find x equals 120 degrees and
04:48 - since 120 is greater than 90 but less
04:55 - than 180 we know that this is an obtuse
05:00 - angle so that makes triangle BDC and
05:06 - obtuse triangle be sure to watch the
05:15 - next video where we're going to talk
05:18 - about the interior angles of triangles
