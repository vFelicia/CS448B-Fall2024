00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're gonna
00:07 - continue working on the game so let's go
00:10 - ahead and come into form 1 DB and you
00:14 - can see when they click button spawn it
00:16 - generates a random character now this
00:19 - could cause some problems that are all
00:20 - based on the method that we used so
00:23 - let's go ahead and make another sub
00:25 - called generate enemy and we'll go ahead
00:31 - and bring this down here and we will
00:35 - copy this right here so we need to copy
00:40 - everything and paste it inside here now
00:45 - we are going to get an error right here
00:49 - so let's just go ahead and add and
00:51 - select and so now what we need to do is
00:56 - let's just go ahead and take these and
01:05 - copy them and we'll paste them under
01:08 - generate enemy so let's go ahead and get
01:11 - rid of everything in here and whenever
01:16 - they spawn it will just call generate
01:19 - enemy so this this way we can reuse code
01:22 - and generate enemies whenever we need so
01:26 - let's go ahead and use recursion so if
01:30 - the picture is not already a zombie so
01:35 - if we don't already have a zombie then
01:36 - let's go ahead and create one so we'll
01:40 - cut this right here then we will create
01:44 - a zombie and change the picture and if
01:48 - it already is a zombie
01:50 - so if picture picture enemy dot image
01:52 - that equals the zombie because we use
01:54 - not right here if it does equal that
01:56 - let's go ahead and call generate enemy
02:00 - so this will just start over from the
02:03 - beginning and they will generate a
02:05 - random number so let's go ahead and go
02:08 - through and do that for each one of
02:11 - these cases
02:12 - so we will cut this so if it's not the
02:20 - villain then create a villain and if we
02:22 - already already have a villain in there
02:24 - then we can generate the enemy now by
02:27 - doing this what we can do what we do is
02:29 - we make it so that it will generate a
02:32 - different type of enemy each time and
02:34 - that we will not get the same enemy two
02:38 - times in a row so if the picture is not
02:40 - already a jack and then go ahead and
02:42 - create a dragon and we need to call
02:45 - generate enemy now let's come up here
02:49 - and see here looks like everything's
02:57 - good so let's go ahead and run this now
03:06 - you guys may be wondering why I didn't
03:08 - just do this in one of the previous
03:09 - tutorials it's because I like to show
03:13 - you problems that you might run into and
03:15 - how you can come up with ideas to fix
03:16 - them and hopefully this will give you
03:19 - guys examples of what to do and how to
03:21 - fix problems I've had some people on my
03:23 - youtube channel tell me that they like
03:24 - it when I do that so I just decided to
03:26 - do it with these tutorials
03:31 - so here's our game we've got the default
03:35 - character that it that's on there right
03:37 - now we will run generate an enemy when
03:43 - the form unloads because this isn't
03:44 - really an enemy object that has been
03:46 - created it's just the picture so we
03:48 - could spawn an enemy we could spawn a
03:49 - dragon spawn a villain a dragon zombie
03:55 - dragon zombie villain dragon looks like
04:00 - we're getting a couple of the same in a
04:02 - row but that doesn't matter because it
04:05 - seemed it seems to be working good and
04:07 - it's more random than it was before
04:10 - so let's go ahead come into four Mondavi
04:14 - be the designer for it we'll double
04:16 - click on form one so that we can open up
04:21 - the form one load event
04:34 - okay so whenever the forum unloads what
04:37 - we want to do is generate an enemy okay
04:42 - so now that we've got that that out of
04:45 - the way let's go ahead and come over to
04:47 - game GUI we'll right-click and we'll add
04:50 - a class now I'll make this a little bit
04:56 - smaller and we will call the class pop I
05:00 - will go ahead and add it so here's our
05:05 - class Popeye now let's go ahead and make
05:08 - some variables so we'll do public shared
05:19 - and we'll go ahead and call it name as
05:22 - string and we will set it equal to
05:25 - Popeye so let's go ahead and make it so
05:28 - that Popeye cannot be edited so we will
05:31 - just make it constant and it looks like
05:39 - if we need if we wanted to be constant
05:41 - we cannot make it shared so every time
05:43 - we create an instance of Popeye it will
05:48 - create a new instance of name so let's
05:52 - go ahead and create another variable so
05:55 - private int health as integer and we'll
06:02 - set that equal to 100 now let's go ahead
06:06 - and create an ArrayList so public
06:12 - read-only
06:17 - and we will just call it attacks as
06:23 - string and we'll just set it equal to
06:27 - punch kick and let's just do anchor
06:36 - throw so now that we have the three
06:40 - different attacks we can use let's come
06:43 - down here and we will create a sub that
06:48 - will attack so public sub attack and
06:58 - then we will by ref enemy health as
07:05 - integer so whenever he attacks let's go
07:09 - ahead and generate a random number
