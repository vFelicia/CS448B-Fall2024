00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live camera for the
00:04 - New Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:06 - going to be taking a look at namespaces
00:08 - now what namespaces do is they make it
00:11 - easier for you to organize your classes
00:13 - so let's say you have one namespace and
00:17 - you can put several different classes in
00:19 - there so that when you want to access
00:21 - let's say you group similar classes in
00:24 - that so when you when you want to access
00:25 - classes that are related to the
00:28 - namespace you would just use that
00:29 - namespace that you created and then
00:31 - access the class in here and also let's
00:34 - say for example if we were making the
00:36 - person program in one of the previous
00:38 - tutorials let's say you wanted to have
00:40 - two class two person classes but you
00:44 - know that if you are working in the same
00:46 - namespace it will not let you create two
00:50 - classes with the same name but if you
00:52 - put each one of those classes in a
00:54 - different namespace then you will not
00:58 - get any errors and your program will
00:59 - what will run fine so let's go ahead and
01:01 - make a little project to a demo
01:04 - namespaces so we'll go ahead and select
01:08 - windows forms application and we'll set
01:11 - the name to namespaces and we'll go
01:15 - ahead and click OK and we'll just wait
01:18 - for that to load
01:28 - okay so we'll come over here to our
01:30 - solution Explorer we will select the
01:33 - namespaces solution we'll right-click it
01:37 - and we will add a class so we'll just
01:44 - name this class the people class so
01:49 - people dot VB go ahead and click add now
01:55 - here is our people class that we just
01:56 - created we're going to create some
01:58 - namespaces to go in to encapsulate this
02:02 - people class so we'll go ahead and come
02:07 - up here and we'll just come right above
02:10 - the people class and we will type
02:14 - namespace other people and now you
02:22 - always have to end a namespace with the
02:25 - end namespace keyword okay so now that
02:29 - we've created our namespace other people
02:31 - let's go ahead and add some stuff to our
02:34 - people class so we will do the first
02:38 - name and the last name so public
02:40 - property
02:43 - first name as a string and then we will
02:50 - do another property last name as string
02:55 - and we'll just go ahead and override the
02:58 - to string function so that it returns
03:01 - their first name and their last name as
03:04 - a string so we'll type public overrides
03:12 - function to string okay so you can see
03:18 - that it automatically fills in the rest
03:20 - of this function for us so what we want
03:22 - to return is we'll return first name and
03:26 - then we will add a space and then we
03:33 - will add the last name
03:38 - okay so you can see that we may
03:41 - namespace other people and a class
03:44 - people inside of that so now I'll just
03:47 - come down here and create a second
03:49 - namespace so namespace friends go ahead
03:55 - and hit enter and you can see that gives
03:57 - us in namespace now if we create public
04:00 - class people and hit enter you can see
04:04 - that we don't get any errors for using
04:05 - duplicate people classes because these
04:08 - are inside of different namespaces so we
04:11 - can go ahead and put the same stuff
04:14 - inside of our friends class so public
04:17 - property first name as string and we can
04:24 - put their last name in there too so
04:26 - public property last name as string and
04:33 - let's go ahead and put let's say how
04:36 - many years we've been friends with them
04:37 - so public property years friends as
04:47 - integer so now I'll just override the
04:52 - two string function so public overrides
04:59 - function to string and we will just
05:05 - return first name and their last name
05:10 - with a space
05:16 - okay so you can see that we have used
05:18 - two seemingly identical people classes
05:21 - but they both are a little bit different
05:24 - and they refer to different things and
05:26 - they are inside of separate namespaces
05:29 - so we've got other people and friends so
05:33 - go ahead you can practice a little bit
05:35 - with namespaces and later on we're going
05:37 - to be going into accessing namespaces
05:40 - and classes with inside of the namespace
05:41 - so once you understand what namespaces
05:44 - are go ahead and move onto the next
