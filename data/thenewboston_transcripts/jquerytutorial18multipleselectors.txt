00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - taking a look at multiple selectors and
00:09 - how we can select two elements on a page
00:11 - if we want to assign for example an
00:14 - event handler to them now as an example
00:17 - I'm going to go ahead and create a
00:18 - button and a paragraph and both of these
00:20 - are going to take the same action when
00:22 - we click on them when we click on the
00:24 - button we're going to show an alert
00:25 - dialog and when we click on the
00:26 - paragraph we're also going to show
00:28 - another dialog however we're going to
00:30 - use multiple selectors to bind the two
00:33 - elements or select the two elements and
00:36 - perform the same action now I'm going to
00:38 - go ahead and do it the incorrect way
00:40 - first of all and then I'm going to go
00:42 - ahead and adjust this and do it the
00:43 - correct way using multiple selectors so
00:46 - the first thing we're going to do is go
00:48 - ahead and create a button so the input
00:50 - type is button going to give this a
00:53 - value and this is called click me or
00:56 - press me more appropriately I'm going to
00:59 - go ahead and assign an ID to this and
01:01 - this is just going to be button and I'm
01:04 - going to come down I'm going to create a
01:05 - paragraph as well and I'm going to give
01:07 - this an ID of paragraph so inside here
01:12 - I'm going to say click me now if we go
01:14 - over to our page and refresh you see
01:16 - we've got a button here which we can
01:17 - click and a paragraph which we can also
01:19 - click once we've assigned event handlers
01:22 - to both of them so we're going to go
01:25 - over to selectors j/s which is an
01:27 - external file that i've created where
01:29 - we're going to write our JavaScript code
01:30 - and we're going to write jQuery inside
01:32 - of here however I'm going to go ahead
01:34 - and need to include this on my page
01:36 - first of all so I'm going to use a
01:38 - script include here to include the
01:43 - source of a javascript file
01:44 - obviously it's always better to keep a
01:47 - JavaScript code external and in
01:49 - different files so I choose this
01:51 - selectors J's file and that's type text
01:54 - forward slash JavaScript exactly the
01:57 - same as we include jQuery so we've now
01:59 - got the use of jQuery and this selectors
02:01 - JS file which is currently blank so we
02:05 - need to go ahead and first of all a
02:06 - assign an event handler to this button
02:09 - so we're doing we do that using normal
02:12 - selector
02:12 - remember we have an ID of button so we
02:15 - in here we use a hash and then we give
02:18 - the name of the ID or the value of the
02:20 - ID and then we assign a click event
02:23 - handler to this now inside here we're
02:26 - going to go ahead and create a function
02:27 - just bring this code down so we have all
02:29 - this line here down so we have the space
02:32 - in here to write this out and indent it
02:34 - looks a lot nicer and I'm going to go
02:37 - ahead and alert something out so let's
02:40 - say something was clicked or something
02:45 - was pressed clicked so now we have this
02:49 - a click event handler assigned to this
02:51 - button ID we can we go ahead and alert
02:55 - something out so let's go ahead to our
02:56 - page and test this when I click press me
02:58 - you'll see something was pressed forward
03:01 - such clicked so we have the correct
03:02 - alert box now with regards to the
03:05 - paragraph there's no event handler bound
03:07 - to this so we need to go ahead and add
03:11 - this event handler now this is the
03:13 - incorrect way to do it so don't take
03:15 - this as you know the advice I'm giving
03:18 - you but we would go ahead and if we were
03:20 - using the paragraph we're doing in
03:22 - exactly the same way so we'd use a hash
03:23 - to reference the ID paragraph so we go
03:27 - ahead and type in paragraph and then we
03:30 - use the same event handler just here
03:32 - with a function inside of it with our
03:35 - block of code here which we can bring
03:36 - down and again we do exactly the same
03:39 - thing so alert something was pressed
03:42 - forward slash clicked so now what's
03:45 - going to happen is we've bound this
03:47 - event handler to our paragraph so now
03:49 - when we click our paragraph we have this
03:52 - message here which we defined just here
03:55 - now if we wanted the same alert box to
03:58 - happen for both of these elements what
04:00 - we've actually done here is
04:01 - unnecessarily duplicated code so we can
04:05 - use an unlimited amount of handlers
04:07 - inside of one selector so let's go ahead
04:11 - and adjust this accordingly
04:13 - now we've already referenced hash button
04:15 - so the button that has the ID button now
04:19 - what we can do is comma separate the
04:20 - values that we want to use in each
04:22 - selection so now I can just add in
04:25 - paragraph here and what jQuery will do
04:28 - is it will select both of these elements
04:29 - and apply this event handle to it so now
04:32 - when we go over to our page we have the
04:34 - same result when we click the button and
04:36 - we have the same result when we click
04:38 - the paragraph as well so now that we've
04:41 - bound this to both of our elements we
04:44 - have the same action performed for each
04:47 - paragraph now what happens if we want to
04:50 - go ahead and only assign this to example
04:52 - only buttons on our page we can use the
04:56 - button selector so its input and then a
04:59 - colon and button so this will select all
05:02 - input types with the valor with the type
05:04 - button all input fields with the type
05:07 - button as well as any IDs with paragraph
05:09 - however we can also go ahead and change
05:12 - this and just use P so we don't just
05:14 - need to reference using IDs we can now
05:16 - remove these IDs and what this selector
05:19 - is now done is selected all buttons on
05:21 - the page or all paragraphs on the page
05:24 - so if you had a few buttons that you
05:26 - wanted to log an event for example for
05:28 - each button that's pressed on your
05:30 - entire page you can go ahead and just
05:32 - use this input button selector so as
05:35 - well as using multiple selectors I guess
05:36 - now we've learnt that you can use a type
05:39 - selector rather than referencing it with
05:42 - a hash and it's ID so all paragraphs and
05:45 - all input buttons or input fields with a
05:47 - type of button are now going to be
05:49 - assigned this event and we'll alert the
05:52 - dialog when they are clicked so let's go
05:55 - ahead to our page and just test that
05:56 - press the button and we see the button
05:59 - has been pressed and we have this alert
06:00 - box and when we click the paragraph we
06:02 - also have the same alert box as well so
06:05 - we can go ahead and we can assign an
06:07 - unlimited amount of event handlers just
06:10 - here inside of our selector so that's
06:14 - how we use multiple selectors in jQuery
06:17 - and how you can dramatically reduce
06:19 - duplicating code using this method
