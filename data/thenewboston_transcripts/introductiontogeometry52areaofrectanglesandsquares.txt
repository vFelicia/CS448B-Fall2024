00:00 - so today we're going to find the area of
00:05 - rectangles and squares the area is this
00:08 - shaded region right here and it's how
00:12 - much square units a shape takes up this
00:18 - is a two dimensional measure area so the
00:25 - perimeter deals deals with what's on the
00:27 - outside the area is what's in the inside
00:31 - of the square so the area for a square
00:35 - is side squared and I'll explain that to
00:39 - you in a minute because the area of a
00:41 - rectangle is the length times the width
00:46 - so length times width and since area you
00:52 - find an area by multiplying and
00:55 - multiplication is commutative it doesn't
00:57 - really matter what you call the length
00:59 - and what you call it with as long as you
01:02 - get this one and this one so for a
01:06 - square all of its sides are congruent so
01:12 - if I was going to take the length times
01:15 - width the length times the width of this
01:19 - square it would be s times s and if you
01:22 - remember when we are going over squares
01:25 - a while ago this just becomes s squared
01:31 - so that's how we get that formula now
01:34 - we're going to do some examples so find
01:38 - the area of each so this is a rectangle
01:43 - so to find the area we're going to take
01:47 - the length 13 times the width and if you
01:55 - put that into it you find that the area
01:58 - is equal to 78 now this thing right here
02:04 - the unit's they gave us they gave us two
02:08 - they gave them to us in centimeters but
02:12 - when I take
02:15 - these two numbers and multiply them
02:20 - together i'm going to multiply the
02:23 - numbers and i'm going to multiply the
02:26 - unit so i get centimeters times
02:30 - centimeters which gives you seventy
02:33 - eight centimeters squared which makes
02:36 - sense because when we find the area
02:38 - we're finding how many little square
02:42 - centimeters fill up our shape and our
02:48 - units are very important when we find
02:51 - the area so if they get a few units you
02:54 - have to make sure you have the correct
02:55 - units on your answer so now we have this
02:58 - and all the ways sides are congruent to
03:01 - this must be a square so that area
03:19 - is 112 and notice they didn't give us
03:25 - unit so i don't have to worry about that
03:27 - now i need to find the area of this
03:32 - shape so we're going to in order to do
03:36 - this we're going to break it in up into
03:39 - smaller rectangles then i can easily
03:41 - find the area of so i'm going to draw a
03:46 - line here this is one rectangle and i'm
03:50 - going to draw a line here this is two
03:53 - rectangles and this is our third
03:56 - rectangle that we're going to use so in
03:59 - order to find the area of this one you
04:04 - have to remember that this six is the
04:10 - area of this entire side this five is
04:15 - the area of just this side so we're
04:19 - going to ignore that six right there and
04:20 - this is going to be 5 times 1 so the
04:25 - area of rectangle 1 r 1 is equal to 5
04:30 - times 1 which is just 5 now if you look
04:36 - over here the area of this rectangle is
04:41 - going to be the same as the area of this
04:43 - rectangle this 6 once again is a 64 this
04:48 - whole side so we're going to ignore that
04:51 - and we just want the five for this part
04:54 - of the side so once again we're going to
04:56 - get area of rectangle three so good to 5
04:59 - times 1 which is five so now I'm going
05:02 - to find the area of this rectangle right
05:04 - here rectangle too so if I know that
05:08 - this part of this leg is 5 in this
05:12 - entire leg is 6 i'm gonna mold minus
05:16 - they'll big the hole and i'm going to
05:19 - subtract apart from it and that means
05:21 - that this little piece right here
05:24 - is one and we would do the same thing
05:27 - over here to get one over here so for
05:30 - this rectangle its area of rectangle 2
05:34 - is equal to 10 times 1 which is 10 so
05:39 - now I'm going to add these all up to get
05:41 - the area of this entire shape inside
05:43 - here so I'm going to at five plus five
05:46 - is 10 plus 10 is 20 so the area of the
05:50 - shape is 20 so now in order to find the
05:55 - shaded area or the area of the shaded
05:58 - region I'm going to take this big area
06:01 - minus this little area so 112 minus 20
06:06 - will give me will give us 92 so that's
06:14 - the area of the shaded region well
06:19 - that's how we're going to do for area of
06:22 - rectangles and squares but the next
06:24 - lesson is going to do deal with area of
06:27 - parallelograms and triangles and they
06:29 - have their own special kind of formula
06:31 - so make sure you come back and watch
06:34 - that
