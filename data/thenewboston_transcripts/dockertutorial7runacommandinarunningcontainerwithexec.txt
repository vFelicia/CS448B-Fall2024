00:00 - all righty guys welcome back to another
00:02 - video
00:03 - and in this one i'm going to show you
00:04 - guys how to run a command
00:06 - in an already running container
00:09 - okay sounds like inception kinda why
00:11 - would we want to do this well
00:13 - imagine that we have a service like
00:15 - redis running on our computer
00:17 - now let's just go ahead and start with
00:19 - this right now so docker
00:21 - container uh will run a redis container
00:24 - right now
00:25 - so i already have it downloaded from
00:27 - docker hub it may take a little bit
00:28 - longer for you but
00:30 - whenever you have a redis container
00:32 - running just keep it running
00:34 - in this tab and pop open a new tab
00:37 - because this is how it would work in a
00:39 - real
00:40 - daily workflow so you want to keep this
00:42 - redis service running
00:43 - but maybe in a separate process you want
00:45 - to run the red
00:46 - cli so you can you know connect to it
00:49 - configure something about redis
00:51 - debug it all while redis is actually
00:54 - running in a separate process
00:56 - so now that we have that running in the
00:58 - background
00:59 - let me just go ahead and run docker
01:02 - container
01:02 - lsa and that is because we're going to
01:05 - need a reference to
01:06 - this redis container's id right here
01:09 - so go ahead and copy that and now that
01:12 - we have read us running
01:14 - ready to tap into it so how do we do
01:15 - this well
01:17 - if we run docker container
01:20 - ex ec what this allows us to do
01:24 - is it allows us to run a command inside
01:27 - an existing container
01:28 - so if you imagine this like a server
01:31 - we're basically
01:32 - sshing into this server so we can run an
01:34 - additional command
01:35 - that is going to be the redis cli so ex
01:39 - ec now after this we're going to pass in
01:42 - the i
01:43 - t flags this is essentially going to say
01:46 - that
01:46 - whenever you run this command we want to
01:48 - be able to interact with it
01:50 - and provide input so that's what that
01:52 - flag means
01:53 - and after this we're just gonna paste in
01:56 - the container id
01:57 - of the container that we're trying to
01:59 - connect to now in this container
02:02 - the last thing before you hit enter is
02:04 - what is the name of the program that
02:06 - you're trying to run and
02:08 - ours is just called the redis cli so
02:11 - again what this is going to do is it's
02:13 - going to run the redis cli
02:15 - directly inside this container so i'm
02:17 - going to hit enter
02:18 - and look at this we get our nice little
02:20 - interactive prompt
02:22 - where we can now interact with redis
02:24 - using the redis cli
02:26 - so just to show you guys that it does
02:27 - work i'll just pass in help
02:29 - yep nothing bugged out and for the redis
02:32 - ai if you hit
02:33 - exit then it exits it
02:37 - all right so now we're back to basics
02:39 - now just to demonstrate real quick the
02:41 - impact
02:42 - that that it flag has is if we run this
02:45 - exact same command
02:47 - again the container id didn't change but
02:50 - we just exclude that it flag i just
02:53 - deleted it
02:54 - i'm gonna hit enter now okay so this
02:57 - reddit cli
02:58 - does run because that's what we
03:00 - instructed it to do
03:01 - but as you can see it just exits right
03:03 - away because we don't have anywhere to
03:05 - you know interact or input text or
03:07 - anything now another
03:09 - interesting thing is anytime you just
03:11 - want to shell into a container like
03:13 - straight up ssh
03:14 - style what you can do is you can use
03:18 - that i t flag again
03:19 - remember anytime you want to interact
03:21 - that's what we do
03:22 - now instead of redis cli we can just
03:25 - pass
03:25 - in sh program and there we go now we
03:28 - just get
03:29 - a simple prompt where we can you know cd
03:33 - ls yada yada all your fun stuff
03:36 - now to exit from this you can either hit
03:37 - command d on a mac
03:39 - or you can type exit and there you go
03:43 - now the last thing i want to point out
03:45 - and this has nothing to do with
03:46 - exec i just don't know where else in
03:48 - this tutorial series to talk about it
03:50 - but that is anytime you want to start a
03:53 - container
03:54 - with shell right away then what you can
03:56 - do is you can run
03:58 - docker container run and
04:01 - include the it flag so you can interact
04:04 - with it via
04:05 - your terminal and we'll just use busybox
04:08 - since we know that
04:09 - this image which we're going to be
04:11 - creating a container out of it does
04:12 - include all those unix commands
04:15 - and after this you can put the default
04:17 - command of sh
04:19 - right away so whenever you create this
04:21 - container and run it
04:23 - then you get your command prompt right
04:24 - away of course you can do ls
04:26 - la all that fun stuff and uh
04:30 - wow home this is what docker views me as
04:34 - just some nobody wow docker it uh
04:37 - that one stinks okay so let's just exit
04:41 - out of here and uh
04:43 - yeah since docker threw me into kind of
04:44 - a depression there i think i'll end on
04:46 - that video and uh
04:48 - go think about life a little bit so
04:50 - anyways thank you guys for watching and
04:52 - i'll see you next time
