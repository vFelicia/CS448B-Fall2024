00:00 - all right hoses welcome back and in this
00:02 - video what I'm going to do is I'm going
00:03 - to show you guys a few simple tips of
00:05 - things you need to remember in order to
00:07 - help out these Bots and spiders whenever
00:10 - they're trying to crawl your site so
00:13 - remember I said that a bot is pretty
00:15 - much an automated program that's going
00:16 - to go to every single web page and it's
00:18 - going to start Gathering up information
00:20 - about it so it's going to gather up all
00:22 - the text and stuff and it's also going
00:25 - to gather up all of the links that are
00:29 - on this page now for each of those links
00:32 - what it's going to do is it's going to
00:34 - go to
00:35 - those and that basically is what a
00:38 - spider is it goes to those links and now
00:41 - once you get to this page you're going
00:42 - to gather up all of these links and then
00:44 - you're going to go to them so why am I
00:47 - saying this I'm saying this because if
00:49 - you ever have a page that cannot be
00:51 - accessed by clicking links let's say
00:54 - that you have a page that you actually
00:55 - need to type in the full URL into a
00:58 - browser then there's no way that that
01:00 - spider is ever going to find it so let's
01:03 - say on my homepage I you know have a
01:05 - bunch of different sections but I put
01:07 - these links to all of my you know
01:09 - programming videos and computer science
01:11 - videos but I also have this math section
01:14 - right here that has a bunch of math
01:17 - videos now the thing is there are no
01:19 - links to that math section or any of
01:21 - those math videos anywhere on my
01:24 - homepage so how the heck is Google going
01:26 - to find this it doesn't just you know
01:28 - start typing in a random crap in a
01:30 - browser and uh you know hope it's a web
01:33 - page what it does is it crawls it so
01:36 - make sure that everything is connected
01:38 - via links very important another thing I
01:41 - want to point out is do not put text
01:44 - inside images so you see we have a link
01:47 - to the Java beginners video right here
01:49 - this link is text so whenever Google
01:52 - goes to this website it already has a
01:55 - little indicator of what it is because
01:57 - of this text right here now if this
01:59 - button right here was just an
02:01 - image like one ping or jpeg or something
02:05 - it would have a very difficult time of
02:07 - reading that this is a stream that this
02:09 - is the Forum so same thing goes with
02:12 - logos whenever you have a logo Google
02:15 - has no way of knowing that this says the
02:17 - New Boston education I mean I'm sure
02:20 - Google does because they're pretty smart
02:22 - and they probably built a million
02:23 - programs for it but the crawler is going
02:25 - to have a very difficult time of reading
02:27 - text inside images now there's actually
02:30 - a way a cool technique that let's say
02:33 - you have a picture of an elephant on
02:35 - your homepage for some reason there's
02:37 - actually a cool way that you can tell
02:39 - Google hey this is a picture of an
02:41 - elephant since it can't just look at it
02:43 - and automatically know it so we're going
02:45 - to be taking a look at that later on to
02:47 - kind of help it out but for now as a
02:49 - general rule do not have text inside
02:52 - images at least important text and the
02:55 - last thing I want to mention for this
02:57 - quick little tip video is these Bots
03:00 - that Google and Bing and Yahoo make
03:01 - they're actually really really good and
03:03 - really smart however there are a few
03:05 - things that they're not really good at
03:07 - one of them is filling out forms so
03:10 - let's say that you have I don't know
03:12 - some web page that you go to but you
03:14 - need to fill out a form to get there
03:16 - maybe you need to enter your email or
03:18 - name to see it or whatever Google is
03:20 - going to have a really difficult time of
03:22 - Ever finding what is behind that form
03:26 - and another thing is a lot of the these
03:30 - social networking sites what you need to
03:32 - do is you need to be logged in to
03:34 - actually see the content so let's say
03:36 - that on my website I don't know a lot of
03:38 - these videos were public you don't need
03:40 - to make an account or anything but maybe
03:43 - and this isn't the case with mine but
03:45 - let's say that you had to make an
03:47 - account to view someone's profile so
03:49 - kind of like Facebook well if you need
03:52 - to make an account to view someone's
03:54 - profile Google is never going to do that
03:56 - it can't just automatically make
03:57 - accounts for social networks that that
03:59 - would be cool if it did though and all
04:02 - of this content right here is therefore
04:04 - never going to be crawled never going to
04:05 - be stored in their database never going
04:07 - to appear in their search results so
04:10 - again remember a couple key things make
04:13 - sure everything is connected by Links if
04:16 - you go to your website and you can't
04:17 - access it just by clicking links then
04:20 - Google is never going to find it make
04:21 - sure you don't have text inside images
04:24 - and also make sure that you don't have a
04:27 - lot of your important content behind
04:30 - private Pages or Pages where you need to
04:31 - be logged in to access so again some
04:35 - quick little tips just to get started
04:37 - just to help out your crawler and in the
04:39 - next video we're going to be really
04:40 - getting into the good SEO stuff it's
04:42 - going to be awesome I'll see you then
