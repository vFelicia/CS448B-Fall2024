00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to continue
00:07 - working on the paint program now all
00:10 - credit for this program goes to the
00:12 - writers of beginning Microsoft Visual
00:14 - Basic 2008 um the authors are theoren
00:17 - Willis and Brian
00:19 - Newsome I took this program from their
00:21 - book and I'm teaching you guys um how to
00:24 - make it and walking you through the
00:25 - steps and explaining everything so now
00:27 - what we're going to do is we're going to
00:29 - allow the user to change the size the
00:31 - size and the color of their pen now this
00:37 - part isn't in the book I uh made this
00:39 - part
00:40 - myself because what's in the book takes
00:42 - a really long time to program and we're
00:45 - already on tutorial 170 something and we
00:48 - still have a lot of stuff to cover so
00:50 - let's come over here to our solution
00:53 - Explorer we'll right click on paint
00:55 - YouTube and let's add a Windows
00:58 - Form
01:01 - so we'll select Windows
01:03 - forms and we will call it option form
01:09 - we'll go ahead and click
01:11 - add okay so now we have our option form
01:15 - so let's go ahead and we'll come over
01:17 - here to our properties of the option
01:19 - form and we need to change the form
01:22 - border style so we'll come up here to
01:25 - form border style and let's make it a
01:28 - fixed tool window
01:30 - so they won't be able to resize it and
01:32 - they can only close out of it so let's
01:35 - make it a little bit smaller here and
01:37 - let's add a toolbox and we will have a
01:41 - combo
01:44 - box and let's go ahead and label this
01:46 - combo
01:47 - box so we'll add a
01:52 - label and we'll call it brush
01:57 - size so set the text to to
02:00 - brush size and let's just set the name
02:05 - to label
02:07 - size and we'll set the name of combo box
02:10 - one to combo box
02:13 - size now let's go ahead and come over
02:15 - here to the toolbox We'll add a button
02:20 - here we'll set the name to button
02:24 - color and we'll set the text to change
02:28 - color so so let's find the text property
02:31 - here so
02:33 - change color and we'll go ahead and
02:37 - Shrink this down some so now what we
02:39 - need to do is come over to our toolbox
02:41 - and let's add a Color Picker
02:44 - dialogue so we need to find our
02:47 - dialogues and we'll double click on
02:50 - color
02:51 - dialogue so we'll just call it color
02:54 - dialog um
02:56 - brush so it's going to be the color of
02:58 - our brush
03:00 - so let's go ahead and we'll come over
03:03 - here to the uh combo box size and
03:07 - whenever whenever they change the index
03:09 - what do we want to do well let's add a
03:12 - select case statement so select
03:16 - case and we will
03:18 - do combo box
03:21 - size do selected
03:26 - index for case Zero
03:30 - what do we want to do well we need to
03:33 - come over here to our option form and we
03:35 - need to add some stuff to our uh
03:38 - collection under the items property so
03:40 - we'll have
03:44 - small
03:45 - medium and
03:50 - large okay so let me zoom in here a
03:52 - little bit uh so you can see it better
03:55 - now the only problem is we can't access
03:59 - the color of paint canvas let's find it
04:03 - here we cannot access the
04:05 - color um variable because we don't have
04:10 - an object of it in here so let's go
04:12 - ahead we'll come over here to our paint
04:16 - YouTube and we need to find the main
04:21 - method now there isn't actually a main
04:24 - method that we can access so what we
04:27 - need to do is we need to come into paint
04:29 - YouTube to right click it and select the
04:32 - properties now here you can see we have
04:34 - our application properties and we have a
04:37 - startup form right here so we want our
04:40 - startup form to be option
04:43 - form so now if we come back into option
04:45 - form let's go ahead and access the load
04:49 - event so we'll scroll up and we will
04:56 - find load where is it
