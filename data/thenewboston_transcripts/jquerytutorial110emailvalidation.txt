00:00 - so recalling it twice the the function
00:03 - okay so now what we want to do is we
00:05 - want to place this result which now
00:08 - equals the return data of validate email
00:11 - into our email feedback spam so email
00:16 - feedback text result and we can do the
00:20 - same thing just down here email feedback
00:28 - dot text result so as I mentioned
00:33 - earlier slightly inefficient because
00:35 - we're calling the ver the function twice
00:37 - and then using this twice to put the
00:40 - same thing in you could take this and
00:42 - apply it to another function that would
00:45 - be slightly more efficient because then
00:47 - you'd only have to again call this
00:50 - function again we might do that towards
00:53 - the end of the tutorial but for now
00:55 - we've taken this result variable which
00:58 - has the contents of validate email which
01:01 - has the content of data which come from
01:03 - the contents of email dot PHP so it's a
01:06 - slight slide of data here and then we're
01:09 - applying it to email feedback so let's
01:11 - go ahead and check this out we click in
01:13 - we get this message we've seen that as I
01:16 - start to type we should be getting hmm
01:19 - okay so it appears that something might
01:23 - be wrong here
01:32 - okay so let's
01:34 - yeah that's ho look here okay so I've
01:36 - returned this data just inside of here
01:40 - so let me just put that down there
01:42 - because we were returning it inside of
01:45 - this function here which in turn wasn't
01:48 - giving us this result value we need it
01:50 - from the function let's go ahead and
01:52 - test that again them sorry I click in
01:54 - here and I start typing and we should be
01:58 - okay so let's go ahead and do this
02:00 - another way let's pull this function
02:04 - down here and that's in here create a
02:09 - variable called data returned and that
02:15 - equal to data and then we'll return data
02:21 - returned and we'll just double check
02:25 - everything here so yeah okay let's see
02:29 - if this works no okay so what we're
02:33 - gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
02:35 - stick to I mean this is version
02:36 - JavaScript now you should be able to see
02:39 - how lazy jQuery makes me what I'll go
02:45 - ahead and do is I will just take the
02:47 - result here and that we did before or
02:53 - take this email feedback selector let's
02:57 - get rid of that and let's get rid of the
03:01 - var in front of this validate email
03:03 - function okay so I'll just go and
03:08 - explain what we are doing now what we're
03:11 - actually doing is removing the returned
03:13 - value of this function and I'm just
03:17 - calling the function itself now once the
03:20 - data has been returned I'm gonna go
03:22 - ahead and use a selector to select the
03:25 - email
03:27 - feedback span and then apply text inside
03:32 - here which is the return data so the
03:35 - validate email function returns the data
03:38 - to this email feedback span so let's go
03:41 - ahead and try that you can see I've just
03:44 - started typing and I've typed Alex and
03:46 - we have the text that doesn't appear to
03:48 - be a valid email address then I go ahead
03:50 - and continue typing and we would
03:53 - retrieve this valid email address
03:55 - message then when we come away from it
03:57 - you see that it disappears however when
04:00 - we come back it revalidate s' it so if
04:02 - for example it was just Alex ah but as
04:05 - soon as we click on here it revalidate
04:07 - s-- the the text inside of there okay so
04:11 - we've looked at a basic concept of email
04:14 - validation obviously if you were using
04:18 - this for every form field it would be
04:20 - inefficient so some kind of function
04:23 - that you would create to validate forms
04:27 - based on their type would be better in
04:30 - this case however in this we've just
04:32 - demonstrated posting data to our email
04:36 - dot PHP far from Ajax using our post
04:42 - HTTP request and essentially they're
04:45 - returning the data and putting it into
04:47 - an HTML element here so that's just some
04:52 - basic email validation in jQuery
