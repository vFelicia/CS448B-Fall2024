00:00 - alright guys welcome to your last story
00:02 - on the CSS box model and the last
00:05 - element that we have to cover is the
00:07 - margin now the margin is the area
00:10 - outside the border and outside the
00:12 - padding it's the area basically that
00:15 - surrounds the entire element so let's go
00:18 - ahead and let's go ahead and actually
00:20 - make some paragraphs they'll probably
00:22 - the easiest to see
00:23 - so paragraphs actually have margin by
00:25 - default one of the few elements so this
00:28 - is a paragraph make sure you spell that
00:32 - Wow I was pretty close actually so
00:35 - anyways let's go ahead and paste that
00:37 - and actually we probably should add a
00:40 - background color so P background color
00:44 - and just make it orange or something
00:46 - nothing too light
00:47 - nothing too dark just right and I'm
00:49 - talking about Warren J and check it out
00:52 - this is Africa afta and this is AB
00:54 - crafte so as you can see by default it
00:58 - has probably mono how how tall is my
01:01 - mouse cursor probably like 10 or 15
01:04 - pixels or something so by default
01:06 - paragraphs have a margin between them
01:09 - but whatever saying all right I wrote
01:11 - this sweet article and I hate I made it
01:15 - into a couple paragraphs but I either
01:17 - think it's too much or I want to tighten
01:20 - the paragraphs up so they're closer
01:21 - together well in order to do this you
01:24 - need to play with the property called
01:26 - margin now the margin like I said is a
01:30 - space around each of these paragraphs so
01:33 - let's go ahead and do that right now
01:35 - just like the the padding that's what I
01:39 - was trying to think of you can either
01:41 - play with margin in one of two ways you
01:44 - can either change your overall or you
01:46 - can change it individually so let's go
01:48 - ahead and the first thing I want to do
01:50 - is show you guys how to tighten up your
01:53 - paragraph so if you want to tighten it
01:55 - up to like one pixel just like that if
01:59 - you set margin a one pixel on your
02:01 - paragraphs it goes from the default
02:03 - which is I'm gonna say it's like 10
02:04 - pixels by default and it refreshes it
02:07 - you now have a one pixel of space in
02:10 - between
02:11 - your paragraphs so that is a way to
02:13 - tighten up you can even even set it to
02:16 - zero if you want but then it wouldn't
02:18 - even be a paragraph at all it would just
02:19 - be like a line break so anyways that is
02:22 - how you would do that now if you want to
02:24 - space it out even more I think it's like
02:26 - 10 or 15 by default so let's really
02:29 - stretch it out to like 40 pixels and you
02:32 - can either do that and now when you
02:34 - press refresh each of your paragraphs
02:36 - has 40 pixels surrounding it so I mean
02:40 - if you're going for that effect then
02:42 - that is what you do and what I want you
02:44 - to take notice of is that the padding
02:47 - does not change the padding and the
02:50 - boarder are staying the same
02:52 - it's the margin around it that is
02:54 - changing so that's the difference
02:56 - between the padding and the margin a lot
02:59 - of people get this confused
03:01 - just remember padding is inside the
03:03 - boarder margin is outside the border and
03:05 - you'll be fine you'll be way ahead of
03:07 - everyone else they'll be lost in the
03:08 - dark because they read books instead of
03:10 - watching my tutorials those idiots
03:12 - so like I said way before you can change
03:16 - margin in one of two ways you can either
03:18 - change your overall or I'm not even
03:21 - going to go through this you can change
03:23 - it one side it's I'm like margin-top
03:26 - spell that wrong top margin bottom
03:30 - margin right and margin left so I don't
03:33 - want to go through each one and show you
03:35 - because it's obvious just like padding
03:37 - what it does but anyways that is the
03:39 - difference between margins and padding
03:41 - and borders and overall that's called
03:45 - the CSS box model how you can play with
03:47 - different areas of an element basically
03:51 - so anyways now you understand the CSS
03:54 - box model we're ready to move on to
03:56 - another topic so anyways thank you guys
