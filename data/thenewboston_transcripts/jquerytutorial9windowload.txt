00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in the last quick video we took a look
00:07 - at loading three different iframes and
00:10 - we used the load the load event handler
00:13 - to actually wait until each one had been
00:16 - loaded and we looked at the example with
00:18 - images as well now in the last tutorial
00:21 - we had a slight problem where we wanted
00:23 - to make sure all the page contents has
00:26 - contents had been loaded so all of the
00:28 - dom elements have been loaded and then
00:30 - we wanted to perform a particular
00:31 - operation or an action and this action
00:34 - was just to alert something else so
00:36 - we're working with very basic feedback
00:39 - now what happens if I go ahead and have
00:42 - three different iframes on a page I'm
00:45 - going to go ahead and just define these
00:46 - now or other elements I mean we're
00:51 - talking about a mix of elements it could
00:53 - be an iframe a image even form element
00:58 - it depends on how you know long you know
01:00 - the page content is but we're going to
01:03 - go ahead and have three different
01:05 - iframes here so we go ahead and make
01:09 - three of these and obviously the sources
01:12 - are going to be different we're going to
01:14 - have evade code at UK and then we're
01:16 - going to go out ahead and have PHP
01:18 - academy' dorg
01:18 - so we've now got these three different
01:21 - iframes on the page now what I want to
01:24 - do is show an alert dialog when the
01:26 - content of these three iframes have been
01:29 - loaded so once each and every one has
01:31 - been loaded
01:32 - I want to then say page has been loaded
01:34 - or window has been loaded and that's
01:37 - giving you a clue as to how we're going
01:39 - to do this because we're going to use
01:40 - window as our selector and then we're
01:43 - going to say load so window dot load
01:47 - inside of this we define a function as
01:49 - we usually would
01:52 - but this time this is going to wait for
01:55 - the entire contents of the page with
01:58 - regards to the elements themselves to
02:00 - load we're not talking about as soon as
02:02 - the dawn has loaded and you know it's
02:04 - ready to go
02:05 - so once each element and its contents
02:08 - for example well let's just take an
02:10 - example when we load a page we have we
02:14 - have the Dom elements that have been
02:15 - initialized however they're not
02:18 - necessarily loaded the contents of them
02:21 - have not necessarily loaded and this is
02:22 - particularly you know useful for images
02:26 - because images sometimes take a while to
02:28 - load like for example if you want to
02:31 - have the user apply a particular or
02:33 - allow them to see a particular thing
02:36 - after an image had been loaded this
02:38 - would be useful so it depends I mean
02:41 - it's all very general and very you know
02:43 - condensed and quick but sometimes when
02:46 - you're working in detail you need to
02:49 - know this okay so after window has
02:52 - loaded we want to go ahead and alert out
02:56 - loaded so what this will do is it will
02:59 - check that each contents of these
03:01 - iframes have been loaded and then it
03:05 - will say the message loaded so let's go
03:09 - ahead over to our browser and take a
03:10 - look at this I'm going to go ahead and
03:12 - refresh the page now you can see that
03:14 - all the pages are loading and now we
03:16 - have this dialog so you notice that each
03:19 - one of these iframes took the time to
03:22 - load before they actually were available
03:25 - and appeared so we have all of the
03:27 - iframe contents loaded now however
03:32 - beforehand in the last tutorial we saw
03:35 - that we couldn't really assign the load
03:38 - to each one individually because that
03:40 - then took each one and loaded
03:43 - you know each high frame was loaded and
03:46 - then we alerted three times so in the
03:49 - last tutorial we did iframe by generally
03:52 - selecting all iframes and then when we
03:55 - went ahead and refresh the page we got a
03:57 - message for each one that had loaded as
03:59 - you can see
04:01 - so that's the window dot load usually
04:04 - with jQuery you're not going to go ahead
04:06 - you're not really going to need to use
04:08 - this and document ready and the function
04:13 - inside of that is enough to actually is
04:17 - enough to actually load the page and
04:20 - then start to perform actions so it
04:22 - depends entirely but feel free to go
04:25 - ahead to the jQuery documentation or
04:27 - Google search this and there's lots of
04:29 - different information on each you know
04:32 - reasoning behind doing each one however
04:35 - we've looked at some you know classic
04:38 - you know raw examples of the differences
04:41 - between this and loading using this and
04:46 - also loading using window
