00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - fifth physics tutorial and in this
00:03 - tutorial we are finally going to be
00:05 - jumping into
00:07 - multiplication with scientific notation
00:09 - sounds fun oh it is well the thing is
00:12 - multiplication is a lot different than
00:15 - addition and subtraction when working
00:17 - with scientific notation now I'll tell
00:19 - you guys the rules of how to do it and
00:22 - then I'll walk you guys through a couple
00:23 - examples the very first thing we need to
00:26 - do is we can't just go ahead and figure
00:28 - out these numbers and then multiply them
00:31 - by each other we could but it would just
00:33 - get really messy so I'm going to show
00:35 - you guys a really easy way what we do is
00:37 - we take this number the one without the
00:40 - exponent and we're going to multiply it
00:42 - by this number and then what we're going
00:44 - to be doing after that is taking this
00:48 - and multiplying it by this and then
00:50 - we're going to be multiplying those
00:52 - together so I know that sounds kind of
00:53 - confusing right now but trust me I'll
00:55 - show you guys right now what I'm talking
00:56 - about so the first thing we need to do
00:59 - is take
01:01 - 6.71 and multiply it by this number
01:04 - right here which is
01:07 - 2.3 and then what we need to do is
01:09 - multiply that by this by this what am I
01:14 - talking about 10 to the 3 time 10 to the
01:19 - 5th so basically these numbers time
01:23 - these numbers is going to give us our
01:25 - answer so what is 6.71 * 10 3 well the
01:29 - answer to that is
01:34 - 15433 and now let's go ahead and
01:36 - multiply 10 to the3 * 10 5th now in
01:40 - order to multiply 10 to the whatever
01:43 - power here's what you do it's 10 to the
01:47 - 3 + 5 that's the rule for multiplying
01:50 - those numbers so what we have here is
01:56 - 15433 that doesn't change times 10
02:00 - to the eth just like that and if we look
02:03 - at this this is kind of in scientific
02:05 - notation already the only thing we need
02:07 - to do is we need to change our decimal
02:09 - point from here to over here so in order
02:12 - to do that we just go ahead and put
02:15 - 1
02:19 - 5433
02:21 - times 10 to the 9th just like that and
02:24 - this is our final final answer there we
02:27 - go so there you go that's how you do
02:29 - that just remember whenever you're
02:32 - multiplying one number in scientific
02:34 - notation by another number in scientific
02:36 - notation pull this number and this
02:39 - number in multiplying by each other and
02:41 - then the two other numbers in
02:43 - multiplying by each other so let me go
02:44 - ahead and walk you eyes through another
02:46 - example so in that example we use three
02:49 - and five which were two positive
02:51 - exponents now let me go ahead and use4
02:54 - and -2 it's a little bit different but
02:56 - it's basically the same thing so again
02:59 - remember the very very first thing we
03:00 - need to do is grab
03:01 - 3.2 and I did that again 3.2 and 6.1 so
03:09 - 3.2 *
03:12 - 6.1 surround those in parentheses
03:16 - times 10 to
03:20 - the4 time 10^
03:24 - -2 so again 3.2 * 6.1 is 19
03:31 - 052 I think yeah I'm pretty sure so now
03:35 - what we need to do is times I'm not even
03:38 - going to go ahead and uh I'm just going
03:40 - to St skip that one step so what you do
03:42 - is you basically have -4 plus -2 so 10
03:47 - to the -6 because remember -4 if you add
03:52 - -2 to it then you end up with -6 so
03:55 - that's how I'm coming up with that
03:56 - exponent right there so now we have to
03:58 - figure out this whole thing right there
04:00 - so basically if you take away those
04:02 - parentheses we're basically in
04:04 - scientific notation right now
04:28 - 19.52% so that's probably what they're
04:30 - looking for right and I can't Circle
04:33 - this right
04:36 - there so 1. n52 *
04:40 - 105 is our answer that's going to get us
04:43 - all that bonus points give me some
04:44 - cookies batch that's what you should say
04:46 - to your teacher if you get it right you
04:48 - know I probably wouldn't take that
04:49 - advice but okay one more
04:53 - example in this last example I have a
04:57 - positive exponent and we're going to
04:59 - multiply it by a scientific notation
05:02 - number with a negative exponent so in
05:04 - order to do that again the same Rule
05:07 - still apply we're going to grab
05:12 - 3.18 and we're going to times it by
05:16 - 9.8 and we're going to take that number
05:19 - and Times
05:21 - by 10 3r *
05:26 - 105 so let's go ahead and figure out 3.1
05:29 - 8 * 9.8 first and the answer to that is
05:33 - 31.1
05:36 - 64 and now what you need to do is times
05:39 - that by again I'm going to skip this
05:41 - step 3 +
05:45 - -5 is -2 so I'm just going to go ahead
05:48 - and write 10 to the -2 and again we are
05:52 - in kind of in scientific notation right
05:54 - there already but what we can do is I'm
05:57 - not even going to write this number in
05:58 - scientific notation because it's easier
06:00 - to see if you just write
06:04 - 31164 in standard notation and I wrote
06:07 - that kind of messy so I'll clean it up
06:08 - for you guys
06:09 - 31 1 6 4 so there you go and I don't
06:15 - know if you if I uh told this to you
06:17 - guys but um basically whenever you have
06:21 - something in the range of 10 to the -3
06:24 - or 10 to the positive3 anything that can
06:28 - fit in between there you don't need to
06:30 - write in scientific notation that's the
06:32 - general rule however if you have a
06:34 - teacher or really anal um you know boss
06:37 - or something he may make you always
06:38 - write it in scientific notation but I
06:40 - just think that writing you know
06:45 - 31164 * 10 the -1 is a lot more
06:50 - confusing than just writing this it's
06:52 - really simple when you have small
06:54 - numbers so I mean you can convert the
06:57 - number 1.5 in a scientific notation if
07:00 - you want but it's just stupid you know
07:02 - what I'm saying so anyways that is
07:04 - basically how you multiply using
07:06 - scientific notation so uh in the next
07:08 - tutorial I'm going to be talking about
07:10 - dividing which is a whole another Beast
07:12 - so uh yeah thank you guys for watching
07:14 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
07:15 - you guys in the next tutorial
