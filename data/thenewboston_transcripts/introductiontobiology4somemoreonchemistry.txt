00:00 - Now we move on to chemical formulas
00:02 - which is the way compounds are written
00:05 - for example water dihydrogen monoxide is
00:09 - written as
00:11 - H2O this means that there are two
00:14 - molecule two atoms of hydrogen combining
00:17 - with one atom of oxygen to form
00:21 - water the little subscript right here
00:24 - tells you the number of atoms that are
00:26 - in said
00:27 - compound and if there's no
00:31 - subscript then it is implied that it is
00:35 - one we have sodium
00:38 - chloride one atom of sodium and one atom
00:41 - of chlorine and acetic acid or vinegar
00:45 - two atoms of carbon four atoms of
00:48 - hydrogen and two atoms of
00:51 - oxygen we have an empirical formula that
00:54 - shows the smallest number of atoms in a
00:57 - compound for example acetic acid
01:00 - the empirical formula is going to be C
01:04 - H2O molecular formula shows the actual
01:07 - number of atoms in a
01:11 - molecule acetic acid again there's
01:13 - actually two atoms of carbon four atoms
01:16 - of hydrogen and two atoms of oxygen and
01:20 - finally the structural formula gives
01:23 - information about the arrangement of
01:25 - atoms acetic acid can also be written
01:28 - like this ch3 C
01:30 - o this means you got your carbon here
01:34 - with three hydrogens on it you got a
01:37 - carbon here and then it's attached to
01:41 - two o's and then the O is attached to an
01:44 - H we next have chemical
01:46 - equations these are how chemical
01:49 - reactions are written and a chemical
01:52 - reaction you have reactants which are
01:54 - what are used to form products
01:59 - water is formed by hydrogen gas and
02:03 - oxygen gas water is formed by hydrogen
02:06 - gas oxygen gas that's what it just said
02:08 - sorry anyways um these chemical
02:11 - equations have to be balanced just like
02:13 - a math equation you have to have the
02:15 - same number of things on the left side
02:17 - as the right side so in order to balance
02:21 - this equation we start off you have two
02:24 - atoms of hydrogen two atoms of oxygen
02:28 - but on the right side you have two atoms
02:31 - of hydrogen but only one atom of oxygen
02:35 - so in order to balance the equation you
02:39 - have to add what are called coefficients
02:41 - which are just numbers before the
02:45 - reactant so to balance this equation you
02:49 - want
02:51 - two molecules of hydrogen gas one
02:54 - molecule of oxygen gas and then you have
02:58 - two molecules of
03:01 - water this is a multiplier so you have
03:05 - two oxygens four hydrogens which equal
03:08 - two oxygens and four
03:11 - hydrogens Now we move on to chemical
03:13 - bonding there are a couple of different
03:16 - types of chemical bonds that can be
03:17 - formed the first example is the first
03:20 - type is an ionic bond ions are atoms
03:24 - with a
03:26 - charge like chloride ion sodium ion this
03:31 - means that an atom has either gained or
03:34 - lost electrons remember if you gain or
03:38 - lose protons you change the
03:41 - element so for example you have your
03:44 - sodium atom here your chlorine atom here
03:48 - this is just going to take an electron
03:52 - to form a bond cuz like I said you
03:56 - either want to have a completely full
03:58 - veent shell or a completely empty veence
04:00 - cell shell excuse me
04:03 - so this chlorine chlorine atom right
04:06 - here is going to take this electron from
04:08 - sodium sodium's veence shell is empty
04:11 - chlorine veence shell is
04:13 - full these types of bonds don't for
04:16 - molecules and it's basically just an
04:18 - attraction so you can
04:22 - have a sodium atom here with a bunch of
04:26 - different chlorine atoms attracted to it
04:28 - because both of these atoms ATS have a
04:30 - charge on them sodium is going to have a
04:32 - plus one charge chlorine is going to
04:34 - have a negative one charge these bonds
04:37 - are pretty weak they for and whenever
04:40 - you dissolve salt in water it's going to
04:43 - form
04:45 - ions Co calent bonds form when atoms
04:48 - share electrons this means electrons are
04:51 - going to spend some time on all the
04:53 - atoms for example you have nitrogen
04:57 - gas which is written in
05:00 - you have your electron density Cloud
05:02 - right here which is where the electrons
05:04 - can be found orbiting around the nucleus
05:07 - these electrons are going to be
05:09 - attracted to the other nucleus for
05:12 - example these electrons are going to be
05:14 - attracted to this atom's nucleus So
05:18 - eventually these electrons are going to
05:21 - be shared calent bond
05:24 - forms the same thing happens here with
05:27 - methane
05:28 - CH4 electrons are all shared there's one
05:32 - electron from hydrogen shares with one
05:35 - electron from
05:37 - carbon carbon has four electrons that
05:40 - can be shared so it's going to share all
05:42 - four electrons with four different
05:45 - hydrogens shared electrons are called an
05:48 - electron pair you have a single Bond
05:52 - when one pair of electrons are shared a
05:55 - double bond when two pairs of electrons
05:57 - are shared and a triple bond when three
05:59 - pairs of electrons are
06:02 - shared single bonds share two electrons
06:04 - double bonds share four electrons triple
06:07 - bonds share six
06:10 - electrons and when electrons spend more
06:12 - time on one particular atom you get what
06:15 - is called a polar bond polar calent bond
06:18 - this means that each atom is going to
06:22 - have a partial
06:25 - charge oxygen is going to pull electron
06:28 - density from hydrogen
06:30 - so oxygen is going to have a partial
06:32 - negative charge hydrogen is going to
06:34 - have a
06:35 - paral
06:37 - partial positive charge and the last
06:40 - thing I'm going to talk about in this
06:41 - video because it's already 13 minutes
06:43 - long is hydrogen bonds these result from
06:46 - the weak electrical attraction between a
06:48 - partially positive hydrogen atom and a
06:51 - partially negative atom the ones you
06:54 - need to remember are oxygen nitrogen and
06:57 - sulfur those are the big ones in in
07:00 - organic systems living systems but
07:04 - basically what's going to happen is
07:05 - you're going to have this partial
07:07 - positive on your hydrogen atoms a
07:09 - partial negative on your oxygen atoms
07:12 - and these are just going to form really
07:14 - weak attractions the partial positive
07:17 - hydrogen atom is going to be attracted
07:19 - to the partial negative oxygen atom and
07:23 - these just form a bunch of different
07:25 - little bonds in water but I'm sorry this
07:29 - video was so long but there's a lot of
07:32 - stuff to cover I know this is very brief
07:35 - or not very detailed but these are just
07:39 - the basics of what you need to know for
07:41 - biology
