00:00 - alright check this out sauerkraut so in
00:02 - the last video what we did is we made
00:05 - these functions to essentially remove
00:07 - comments we can call this function
00:10 - whenever we need to edit a comment give
00:12 - it a new text and the array item so now
00:16 - all we have to do piece of cake is
00:18 - whenever we click these buttons hook
00:20 - them up to these functions all right so
00:23 - the buttons were in this comment so
00:27 - essentially whenever I click Save right
00:30 - here I want to call well what we'll wait
00:33 - a minute oh crap we got a little problem
00:37 - here so check this out you see this
00:40 - button right here all of these buttons
00:42 - they belong to the comment component
00:45 - however the functions that we want to
00:47 - use are in the board component so how
00:52 - the heck are we supposed to call these
00:53 - functions from an entirely different
00:56 - component well the answer my friend is
00:59 - to use properties properties I thought
01:03 - that was for like customizing a
01:04 - component well check this out it's
01:07 - really cool
01:07 - whenever use properties what he can do
01:10 - is instead of just passing numbers and
01:12 - strings to comment you can actually pass
01:15 - entire functions so in other words we
01:19 - can have a property that's equal to this
01:21 - entire function pretty sweet eh so in
01:25 - the comment whenever we make one let's
01:27 - just go ahead and add a new property and
01:30 - just to show you guys that it's
01:31 - different um let's say the first thing
01:34 - we want to do is we want to pass in this
01:36 - function right here so I would call a
01:39 - property uh update comment text and you
01:43 - can name it whatever you want and this
01:45 - is going to be equal to this
01:51 - this dot Update comment so again later
01:59 - on whenever we run this program comment
02:01 - is now going to have a property called
02:03 - update comment text and this is going to
02:06 - be equal to this function its owners or
02:09 - the board's function pretty sweet a so
02:14 - now the last thing we have to do is just
02:15 - make it for this comment right here so
02:19 - we can actually delete the comments so
02:21 - I'll just say I'll make a new property
02:23 - called delete from board and this is
02:27 - going to be equal to this dots remove
02:31 - comment alright so whenever we create a
02:36 - comment what information do we need to
02:38 - give it we need to give it a key in
02:40 - index we're going to throw it this
02:43 - function and also throw in this function
02:45 - and of course the text so it has some
02:48 - text to display right there alright so
02:52 - now that we got that taken care of let's
02:54 - go ahead and back up to our comment
02:56 - component and hook these up so we
02:59 - already have event handlers for editing
03:03 - removing and saving again edit is
03:07 - whenever you click this save is whenever
03:09 - you click this and remove is whenever
03:11 - you click this right here so we got all
03:14 - the hard work taken care of and actually
03:16 - a lot of this stuff we're just going to
03:18 - keep in for example with the editing
03:20 - we're also going to change that the
03:21 - true/false we're just going to kind of
03:24 - include two more things so let me just
03:26 - go ahead and take care of remove first
03:28 - so in other words whenever we click the
03:30 - remove button on this comment then what
03:33 - are we going to want to do well we're
03:35 - going to want to call this dots props
03:37 - and remember we passed in let me make
03:41 - sure I don't copy this wrong we passed
03:44 - in a property called delete from board
03:46 - now this delete from board is equal to
03:50 - this function right here so we have to
03:54 - remember whenever we use this property
03:56 - we also need to pass in the index I'll
04:00 - show you guys how to do that so whenever
04:03 - we call this
04:05 - delete from board we also need to prep s
04:08 - in the index of this comment how do we
04:11 - do that well it's easy since we already
04:13 - passed the index in as a property we
04:15 - call this dots props dots index pretty
04:20 - cool way so that is the way that you can
04:23 - pass in an index which is an ID number
04:25 - you can pass in a function from the
04:28 - owner or the parent and then it can pass
04:33 - that back up to the parent so there you
04:36 - go
04:36 - and words my other one edit is it for
04:39 - editing and saving right here so same
04:42 - thing was saved and I can probably let
04:46 - me get rid of this and tighten all this
04:47 - up so it's a little bit more compact
04:49 - alright
04:49 - so whenever these are leaves a comment
04:52 - like my name is Bucky and they hit save
04:55 - then what do we want to do well all we
04:58 - want to do is we want to call this dot
05:00 - props and I forgot the function name
05:03 - already update comment text now remember
05:07 - whenever we use this then it requires
05:09 - the new text and the position in the
05:13 - array so this dot drops update comment
05:17 - text now the new text is equal to Val
05:20 - and actually we don't even need that
05:21 - variable since we're only using it once
05:25 - so we can actually just use it like that
05:27 - and the index is this so this is the new
05:32 - text and this is the ID of the comment
05:38 - boom roasted there you go so now I think
05:42 - everything should be working correctly
05:44 - so let me go ahead and refresh this and
05:46 - I won't put my logs out because we'll
05:49 - see if it works all right so I like
05:51 - bacon let me go ahead and change this to
05:52 - my name is Bucky and hit save and check
05:57 - it out pretty sweet eh now if I want to
06:00 - delete want to get ice cream
06:01 - I hit remove and it deletes it how
06:04 - stinking awesome is that so just to kind
06:08 - of recap and give you guys real quick
06:09 - overview so this kind of sticks in your
06:11 - brain whenever you have information and
06:14 - you want to pass them to a child
06:16 - component you can use properties
06:18 - now a property can be something simple
06:20 - just like a number as we saw right here
06:22 - or if you want to take one of these
06:25 - functions and allow the child to use it
06:28 - you can actually just pass the entire
06:30 - function in as a property and again you
06:33 - can name these properties whatever you
06:34 - want you can name it bacon and it work
06:36 - it really doesn't matter now since you
06:39 - do that the child will now have access
06:44 - to the parent function via a property
06:48 - and remember whenever you use these
06:50 - functions just make sure to get your
06:52 - parameters correct since they never
06:54 - really auto populate so there you go
06:57 - that is how you pass that at a children
06:59 - and how you can also pass data back up
07:01 - to the parent using functions so now we
07:05 - got everything working beautifully and
07:07 - yeah I'm gonna go admire this for a
07:09 - second and in the next video I'll show
07:11 - you guys how to add new comments it's
07:13 - actually really simple so yeah I think
07:15 - that's for watching I will smell ya next
07:17 - time
