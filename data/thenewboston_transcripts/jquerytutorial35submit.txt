00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:07 - submit event handler in jQuery now the
00:11 - submit event handler essentially just
00:14 - checks for a form submission so in this
00:18 - tutorial I'm going to outline an example
00:21 - of an email newsletter sign up we're
00:24 - obviously not going to be creating the
00:25 - functionality to actually sign a user up
00:28 - however we're going to be creating the
00:30 - outline of this so that you can go ahead
00:32 - and validate and then insert a data into
00:35 - a database for example so let's go ahead
00:38 - and outline the or draw up the HTML for
00:42 - this just so we know what we're doing we
00:45 - can see the example on the screen I'm
00:47 - going to create a form with an action of
00:50 - hash so we don't actually submit the
00:53 - form I'm then going to give this an ID
00:55 - as sign up underscore four I'll go ahead
01:00 - and end the form and now we have our
01:03 - actual form now remember the idea is
01:05 - where we reference so we're going to be
01:07 - referencing signup underscore form when
01:09 - we check for the form submission go
01:12 - ahead and create a couple of paragraph
01:15 - areas paragraph tags and I'm going to
01:19 - put first of all in here email and then
01:22 - an input area so an input type of email
01:27 - the idea of this is going to be user
01:30 - underscore email and in this paragraph
01:33 - area I'm going to put the registration
01:36 - button or the submit button so sign up
01:40 - sorry submit there and the value
01:44 - sign up so some pretty standard markup
01:48 - quite easy to understand so when we type
01:52 - in the users email or the user types in
01:54 - their email we want to click signup
01:55 - you'll notice that I'm using html5 so if
01:59 - I was to example type Alex and press
02:01 - sign up html5 automatically validates
02:04 - the email address on the front end for
02:08 - us
02:09 - however if they if you were to exam for
02:12 - example use this as just text you would
02:15 - you would and not have that validation
02:20 - in place so let's go over to our text
02:22 - editor and start to think about what we
02:25 - need to do and we first of all need to
02:27 - create an external javascript file which
02:29 - is going to handle the event so let's
02:31 - create a new add file in our text editor
02:35 - and I'm going to call this submit Jas
02:37 - now that we've got submit is this is
02:40 - where our event handler is going to be
02:42 - placed however we need to include this
02:44 - into our page so let's go ahead and type
02:47 - script type equals text forward slash
02:51 - JavaScript the source is going to be is
02:55 - forward slash submit is and we can end
02:58 - the script there so now that we've
03:00 - included submit jsr into our into our
03:03 - page we can actually go ahead and start
03:05 - to write this now the first thing we
03:08 - need to do is check for the event hand
03:10 - handler we need to check that the submit
03:14 - has happened on the forum currently if
03:17 - we check we click submit and nothing
03:19 - actually happens
03:21 - so inside submit is we need to create an
03:24 - event handler for this so we used dollar
03:26 - and then inside we reference the form
03:29 - that we want to use the sutter the
03:31 - submit event handler on which is signup
03:34 - underscore form signup underscore form
03:38 - now we need to use dot submit as the
03:42 - event handler inside the parentheses we
03:45 - need to create a function that's going
03:47 - to be run when this event handler is
03:49 - triggered triggered so that's function
03:52 - and then our block inside of our block
03:55 - we need to write our code so we can just
03:57 - pull the
03:58 - down now instead of here we want to
04:00 - write the code that's going to be
04:03 - performed when we actually submit the
04:06 - form so at the moment we could test this
04:08 - by saying alert and submitted so inside
04:14 - of our browser let's refresh and click
04:15 - signup you'll see that we get the alert
04:18 - box submitted so let's return to our
04:21 - text editor and start to retrieve this
04:24 - email value here and then we can relay
04:27 - it back to the user now we want to relay
04:29 - it into an inside of a div which is just
04:32 - below the signup form so I'm going to
04:34 - call this signup feedback now the reason
04:38 - I call it signup feedback this could be
04:40 - an area for example where you want to
04:42 - feedback either an error or a
04:44 - confirmation message to say that the
04:47 - user's email address has been registered
04:49 - so we're going to pull that up for now
04:51 - because we're going to use the jQuery
04:52 - HTML function to insert our feedback
04:56 - into here so inside submit j/s we want
05:00 - to first of all take the value of the
05:02 - user's email so I'm creating a new
05:04 - variable called user underscore email
05:07 - and that's going to be equal to again
05:09 - the reference of sign oh no it's not
05:13 - it's the reference of user email
05:16 - remember so user email dot Val we use
05:21 - the valve function to take the current
05:23 - value inside of this field here so now
05:28 - that we have this user email variable
05:31 - stored we can go ahead and relay it back
05:34 - into our user our signup feedback div so
05:39 - we reference this again with a dollar
05:41 - sign and inside of here
05:42 - signup feedback then we can say dot HTML
05:47 - and inside of here we can put some
05:49 - string data that the HTML that we want
05:53 - to put into the div so for now what I'm
05:56 - going to do is I'm just going to type
05:58 - something like thanks your email in fact
06:03 - now we can just say thanks
06:05 - and then plus so it appending on a value
06:08 - and that value is user underscore email
06:10 - and then plus to append the rest of the
06:13 - text has been signed up so bear in mind
06:18 - that if you wanted to actually create
06:20 - this into a functional application and
06:22 - actually store this email address you
06:24 - would write the you would write the code
06:26 - say here for example an ajax request to
06:32 - post this to a PHP page which would then
06:34 - in turn insert the value into the
06:36 - database or it would return an error so
06:39 - you would create this code here however
06:41 - obviously in this tutorial we're just
06:43 - looking at the event itself so we're not
06:46 - going to actually get into that so now
06:49 - what's going to happen is once the form
06:51 - has been submitted we grab the users
06:53 - email referencing this email field here
06:56 - and we then relay it back to the user
06:59 - inside the sign up feedback div that we
07:02 - created under the form so really this
07:04 - could go anywhere for example up here it
07:08 - doesn't matter where we place it it's
07:10 - still going to reference that object so
07:13 - let's go ahead and refresh when I click
07:15 - signup we don't have any validation in
07:19 - place so we will just get a blank a
07:21 - blank email in our div however let's go
07:27 - ahead and properly register so I'm going
07:29 - to type in my email address and I'm
07:31 - going to click signup oh okay
07:34 - so the problem here is that the hash
07:37 - obviously has actually submitted this so
07:40 - I'm just going to get rid of that there
07:41 - and refresh and we'll see if that's
07:45 - worked so Alex at PHP academy' org and
07:48 - then click signup and you'll see that we
07:50 - get this message up here thanks Alex
07:53 - stop Alex at PHP academy' de org has
07:55 - been signed up so this is a front-end
07:58 - example of how you would use submit to
08:01 - actually handle a form submission in
08:04 - jQuery and you can see that the
08:07 - front-end is now complete we just don't
08:08 - have the backend validation so just by
08:11 - using the submit handler we've created
08:13 - an email signup front-end
08:17 - application if you like or front the
08:19 - front-end design and the functionality
08:20 - we just don't have the rest in place to
08:23 - store the email
