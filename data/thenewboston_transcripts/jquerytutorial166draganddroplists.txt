00:00 - hi this is IX from PHP academy' talk
00:02 - with the video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston now in this example application
00:07 - we're going to take a look at creating a
00:09 - simple drag-and-drop list and by this
00:13 - we're going to be dragging particular
00:15 - elements in this case we're going to be
00:17 - dragging Li elements from an unordered
00:20 - list into a div and then appending the
00:23 - text associated with them so essentially
00:26 - what it's going to look like is this and
00:28 - what's going to happen is we're going to
00:29 - be able to drag elements into this div
00:31 - and they actually append on here and
00:36 - then we can drag more than one element
00:37 - in if we like now this isn't a foolproof
00:40 - shopping list I guess this the names
00:42 - here give away that sort of food items
00:45 - but it does give you a good idea of how
00:48 - we are appending the text inside of here
00:53 - depending on what we dragged in so it's
00:56 - a really good way to practice the
00:58 - draggable and droppable elements using
01:01 - jQuery UI ok so let's go ahead and look
01:04 - at the code this is the index page we've
01:07 - obviously included jQuery the jQuery UI
01:10 - and UI j/s which we're going to be
01:12 - writing our code in now we've also got
01:14 - style dot CSS which is extremely
01:16 - important because we're going to need to
01:18 - style up a lot of our page as well as
01:21 - the borders associated with list and
01:24 - obviously the list itself so the first
01:26 - thing we're going to do is create an
01:28 - unordered list and inside here we have
01:31 - each li element and I'm going to have
01:33 - three of these for three different items
01:35 - this works with an unlimited amount of
01:39 - items within Li tags so you can add as
01:43 - many items as you want so I'm just going
01:45 - to go ahead and create a few items here
01:52 - and now that I've done this let's go
01:54 - over to our page and you can see that we
01:55 - have something looking like this now I
01:57 - want to style this up to remove some of
01:59 - these bullet points as well as the
02:02 - padding as well on this let's go to
02:04 - style dot CSS which I've included in my
02:06 - document as well and let's go ahead and
02:09 - style the unordered list so we're going
02:11 - to have a width of 100 pixels because by
02:14 - default this reaches out across the
02:16 - document and we'll have problems
02:17 - dragging I then want to set the padding
02:21 - to zero pixels and what this is going to
02:24 - do is just pull that in a little bit and
02:26 - we want the list style to be none so we
02:31 - don't have any of the bullet points okay
02:35 - so now that we've done this let's done
02:36 - this get let's go ahead and create our
02:38 - div which will be our list area I'm
02:42 - going to given this an ID of Lists now
02:44 - at the moment obviously we don't see
02:46 - anything we need to go ahead and give it
02:47 - some style so inside here we want to
02:50 - style our list element our list div on
02:55 - our page and the width of this is going
02:57 - to be 120 pixels and the height I'm
03:00 - going to set to 180 pixels and then
03:03 - going to give it a background color just
03:05 - so you can see where it is and that's
03:07 - going to be F 0 F 0 F 0 and the border
03:10 - by default is going to be set to 1 pixel
03:13 - solid and black so now we have something
03:17 - that looks like this so we're going to
03:19 - eventually be able to drag these inside
03:21 - here now when we drag elements over we
03:24 - want this border to increase to 2 pixels
03:27 - so I'm going to go ahead and create a
03:32 - class of our list div and that's going
03:35 - to be called border and inside here I'm
03:38 - just going to specify the border width
03:42 - and that's going to be 2 pixels ok so
03:45 - now that we've done this we need to go
03:47 - ahead and actually start to create our
03:50 - UI j/s which like I mentioned earlier we
03:52 - have included in the page and this is
03:54 - going to make these li elements
03:56 - draggable so
03:59 - let's create a document ready point here
04:02 - and inside here we have a function ok so
04:06 - once this is done once the page has been
04:08 - loaded we want to make these elements
04:10 - here draggable so we can drag them
04:12 - around the page so the first thing we do
04:15 - is we go ahead and use a selector this
04:18 - time what we're doing is we're selecting
04:20 - Li on its own so all Li elements on the
04:24 - page we want to make draggable now
04:27 - there's a few things we need to specify
04:28 - in here being the options in for the
04:32 - draggable element or draggable function
04:35 - i guess if you want to call it and this
04:37 - the first one is hover class and this is
04:40 - going to be the class that we put into
04:44 - this so the class that we apply to this
04:46 - div when an element has hovered over
04:49 - before we do that let's just go ahead
04:51 - and look at the draggable element so you
04:54 - can see that we can now drag them across
04:55 - the page obviously we can drag them up
04:58 - here which we don't want we'll fix that
05:00 - a bit later
05:01 - so the hover class is going to be border
05:07 - so now when we hover out when we drag
05:10 - over that hasn't worked
05:12 - let's check why that might be let's just
05:16 - go back into here list order
05:26 - now we might want to go and say
05:29 - border:2px solid black oh so my
05:37 - apologies I have absolutely no idea what
05:42 - I'm doing
05:43 - the draggable doesn't take a hover class
05:45 - because this is the draggable element
05:48 - okay so that probably threw you off a
05:50 - bit but the draggable element doesn't
05:53 - take the hover class I'm thinking of the
05:55 - div itself so let's go ahead and
05:57 - actually get set the correct properties
05:59 - to draggable so the containment of this
06:02 - we need to set to our document and what
06:05 - this does is it stops our elements going
06:07 - off of the page you can see that now
06:08 - they've stopped once my cursor leaves
06:10 - the the document itself the next thing
06:14 - we want to do is set revert to true and
06:18 - what this will do is it will revert the
06:21 - element back to its original location
06:23 - once it has left here so it won't stay
06:26 - in a particular place forever that's
06:28 - extremely important because we want to
06:30 - drag append and not return to its
06:32 - original place okay so now on with the
06:35 - actual list itself we're going to go and
06:39 - make the list so we reference this as
06:42 - hash lists so using a ID selector and we
06:46 - want to make this droppable so now that
06:50 - we've made it droppable nothing is
06:51 - actually changed because we haven't
06:53 - applied any events or any properties to
06:55 - it now we can want to test the air
06:58 - actually works so what we're going to do
07:00 - is inside curly brackets we want to say
07:03 - drop function and then inside this
07:06 - function we're just going to go ahead
07:08 - and say alert let's just pull that over
07:11 - a bit we want to say alert dropped and
07:16 - this will check if it's working so yeah
07:19 - is working as I dropped this element
07:21 - over we have this dialog saying dropped
07:22 - and then that reverse back to its
07:24 - original position
