00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - looking at the fade in function in
00:09 - jQuery which allows us to fade a
00:11 - particular element of our choice in our
00:14 - webpage so the first thing I'm gonna do
00:17 - is I'm going to use the example of an
00:19 - image so I have an image saved in this
00:23 - directory let's just take a look at that
00:26 - and it's Tartan jpg so I'm going to
00:29 - include this into my page so Tartan jpg
00:34 - give it an alt attribute which would be
00:38 - tartan and we also need to give this an
00:41 - ID so I'm going to give this an ID and
00:44 - just call it image so this is what we
00:46 - reference to when we need to fade this
00:48 - in or in the next part of the tutorial
00:50 - or fade this out so now that we've got
00:53 - our image let's open up our browser and
00:55 - preview it you can see that it's just an
00:57 - image on a page plane okay so now what
01:01 - we want to do is we want to include the
01:02 - functionality to fade this in when our
01:04 - page actually loads so I've included
01:06 - effects j/s which is going to allow me
01:09 - to do this and obviously I have jQuery
01:11 - Jes included as well so what I'm going
01:15 - to do is I'm going to allow the image to
01:17 - fade in once the document has loaded so
01:20 - we need to reference the document which
01:22 - is document in parenthesis obviously
01:24 - with the leading dollar sign and then we
01:30 - use the ready function and inside of
01:32 - this we create a function with a block
01:35 - and inside here we can write exactly
01:37 - what we want to happen so what we want
01:39 - to do is we want to take this image
01:41 - element which we've named image this ID
01:44 - that with this image page element that
01:50 - we've named image sorry then what we
01:53 - want to do is we want to use jQuery to
01:55 - fade it in from here being not visible
01:59 - when the page loads so what we can do is
02:03 - we can say dollar and we need to
02:04 - reference this image
02:06 - and then we can say dot fade in now
02:10 - let's go to our browser and preview this
02:12 - so you can see that it fades in as soon
02:15 - as we load the page now there are some
02:18 - additional parameters that we can give
02:20 - this function in order to change how it
02:22 - works and the first one is the speed now
02:25 - we can name this ourselves so sorry we
02:29 - could say slow or we could say fast for
02:31 - example or we can give it a numerical
02:33 - representation so we might have a
02:35 - thousand that's one seconds because
02:37 - we're using milliseconds or you could
02:39 - say something like five thousand which
02:41 - would represent five seconds let's go
02:44 - ahead and say two seconds for now and
02:46 - you'll see that the speed in which it
02:48 - loads in which the animation takes place
02:51 - will be a lot slower let's go and give
02:56 - it the example of slow so you can see
03:01 - that it's loaded in a lot or faded back
03:07 - in a lot slower than if we were to use
03:10 - fast for example that's a very quick
03:11 - fade in we also have the optional
03:15 - parameter of how it works now by default
03:19 - this is swing this is just the way the
03:21 - animation takes place and and from it
03:25 - being not visible to visible we could go
03:29 - ahead and use linear when we refresh it
03:33 - just works in a slightly different way
03:34 - it's quite hard to see how it works but
03:38 - for now that's that's an option now the
03:43 - last is a callback function so what we
03:45 - can actually do is we can use a function
03:47 - to again display when this animation has
03:52 - faded in so we could say function create
03:55 - a block and just bring this down and
03:58 - inside of here once this animation is
04:00 - complete and completely faded in what we
04:03 - could do is we could say perhaps append
04:05 - some text to a div or a span so I'm
04:08 - going to create a div just here
04:11 - and I'm going to call this image
04:13 - underscore feedback and inside effect I
04:18 - want to reference this again so image
04:21 - underscore feedback and I want to append
04:25 - some text onto it or create some text
04:28 - inside this div and I'm just gonna say
04:30 - effect complete so now what's going to
04:34 - happen is however however slow or fast
04:37 - we have this once the animation is
04:39 - finished finished we have this callback
04:41 - function to let us know so when I press
04:43 - f5 you can see or let's just change the
04:51 - visibility of this inside let's just say
04:54 - style equals display:none so I'm using
05:00 - inline CSS just to style this so we
05:03 - can't see it initially when i refresh
05:05 - you can see that as we fade in we don't
05:08 - have this effect complete text there
05:10 - until the animation is complete so the
05:13 - callback function could be used to
05:14 - perhaps load an image and then display
05:17 - additional images so that's an option or
05:20 - that's a usage of it again if we just if
05:22 - we load it in say in two seconds
05:24 - this will take slightly longer and then
05:27 - it will display our effect complete
05:29 - message there so this doesn't have to be
05:32 - used with images it can be used with any
05:34 - other HTML element so you just do
05:36 - exactly the same thing you would use fit
05:39 - the fade in function but this time
05:41 - reference something different for
05:42 - example if the ID was for example a form
05:46 - or a text a text input field you could
05:50 - actually fade these in it as well but I
05:52 - think images is a nice example to use
05:55 - with fade in when you're looking at
05:57 - effects in jQuery
