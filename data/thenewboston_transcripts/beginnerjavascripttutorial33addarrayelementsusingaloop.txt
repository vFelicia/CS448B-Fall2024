00:00 - what is going on guys is bulky and
00:01 - welcome to your 33rd JavaScript tutorial
00:04 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:05 - going over how to add array elements
00:09 - using a loop now we're going to be
00:11 - learning this for a couple reasons first
00:12 - of all whenever you're working in web
00:14 - design and JavaScript it's a cool little
00:16 - technique that is definitely going to
00:18 - come in handy and aside from that it
00:21 - kind of takes the things that we learn
00:22 - already and combines them into a cool
00:25 - little mini program so before I get into
00:27 - that I'm going to be using something
00:29 - called the prompt and I can't remember
00:31 - if I tell you guys prompt in this
00:33 - JavaScript series or the left JavaScript
00:35 - series but if it if I already taught
00:37 - this to you guys and you already know
00:39 - what it means I apologize but I just
00:41 - want to you know go over anyway so
00:42 - basically what a prompt is is it's a lot
00:47 - similar to an alert box the only
00:50 - difference is the user can enter text in
00:53 - a little text box in with the text that
00:55 - they entered say the N are their name
00:57 - Buckey or something you can take that
00:59 - name and set equal to the variable so it
01:02 - pretty much is easy way to allow the
01:04 - user to create their own variables so
01:07 - let me show you guys exactly what I'm
01:08 - talking about go ahead and make variable
01:10 - I'm going to name mine pi or whatever
01:11 - and set it equal to PR om PT this is
01:15 - built in JavaScript function so no need
01:17 - to you know create it yourself later on
01:19 - and prompt takes two parameters the
01:22 - first parameter is something like enter
01:25 - your name the first parameter is going
01:28 - to basically give them a little dialogue
01:31 - um like if you had a prompt that you
01:34 - want them to enter in your name you
01:35 - would be like answer your name if you
01:37 - want to prompt say pick a number you're
01:39 - right pick a number you'll see later on
01:40 - where this appears on the text box and
01:42 - the second parameter is what appears in
01:46 - the text box by default now we don't
01:48 - want anything to appear in text box by
01:50 - default so we're just going to leave
01:52 - this blank but you need to put those
01:53 - empty double quotation marks so now
01:56 - whatever they enter in this text box or
01:59 - the prompt box that pops up it's going
02:01 - to be stored in the variable pi so now
02:03 - what we can do is we can print out that
02:05 - variable you know using how we already
02:08 - know document right so document dot
02:11 - right and we're right like hello and
02:16 - then just write the name PI so let's go
02:19 - ahead and save this and see what the
02:21 - heck I'm talking about so here is my
02:23 - prompt box right here enter your name
02:26 - Bucky Roberts okay and now it says hello
02:31 - Bucky Roberts simple enough so like I
02:33 - said it's basically a prompt box that
02:36 - gives the user a dialog such as enter
02:40 - your name and by default if you leave
02:43 - the second parameter empty just double
02:45 - quotation marks nothing is going to
02:47 - appear in here but you can put something
02:48 - in there by default like enter text here
02:51 - that's like one of the common techniques
02:53 - many ways I just wanted to show you guys
02:55 - what prompt box was so you guys aren't
02:58 - lost whenever I teach you guys this new
03:00 - technique so anyways the technique I'm
03:02 - going to teach you guys is how to add
03:04 - elements to an array using a for loop so
03:08 - let's go ahead and make an array called
03:09 - crap and set it equal to new array and
03:12 - let's go ahead and give a size of like
03:14 - three elements already so right now our
03:17 - array is empty we don't have any
03:18 - elements in it so let's go ahead and
03:20 - make a loop that runs three times so in
03:24 - order to do that go ahead and your
03:26 - parameters are this I equals zero it's
03:28 - going to start at zero and then go I
03:31 - it's less than three so then whenever we
03:34 - increment by one using I plus plus this
03:37 - is going to run three to three times
03:39 - again you might think zero one two three
03:42 - that's four times but notice that this
03:44 - is I is less than three so when it gets
03:47 - to three it doesn't run it's only going
03:48 - to run on this zero one and two so if
03:53 - you count those up it's three times so
03:55 - now we know that I is going to be equal
03:57 - to zero the first time one the second
04:00 - time and two the third time so now we
04:03 - can use that to our advantage because
04:04 - remember whenever we're creating an
04:07 - array array index the start is zero so
04:10 - though then again what am I saying then
04:12 - again then whenever we create our array
04:15 - we can just go ahead and stick I in here
04:17 - and now it's going to run three times
04:18 - first it's going to say crap zero the
04:21 - second time it runs
04:22 - is going to be crap one and the third
04:24 - time is going to be crap too those are
04:26 - the three elements that we need to you
04:29 - know fill our array so let's go ahead
04:31 - and we can just add elements in here
04:35 - like hey now or you know baked beans or
04:38 - whatever we want but we want the user to
04:40 - enter these elements so in order to do
04:42 - that here is where we use that technique
04:45 - we just learned called the prompt box
04:48 - just like that so let's go ahead and
04:50 - give them you know something like add
04:53 - something to the array why hit caps lock
04:58 - I don't know but
04:59 - f it I'm keeping it and then we don't
05:02 - want to put anything in there by default
05:03 - because they'll just be dumb so now
05:06 - what's going to happen is this prompt
05:08 - box is going to pop up three times the
05:11 - first time it's going to say add
05:13 - something to the rate you're going to
05:15 - type something in and it's going to add
05:16 - it to the array index zero the next time
05:20 - you type something it's going to add it
05:21 - to array index one in the last time it's
05:24 - going to add something to array index
05:25 - two so now we have a populated array and
05:28 - then we can just do something with it
05:30 - like print it out on the screen like
05:31 - document dot write and just go ahead and
05:38 - write something like crap zero plus crap
05:43 - 1 plus crap
05:46 - 2 so let's go ahead and save this and I
05:49 - got a feeling something's going to
05:51 - happen here Oh check it out it worked
05:53 - perfectly
05:53 - I thought that this was going to appear
05:55 - over here off the screen but game time
05:57 - so it says add something to the array
05:59 - now we're going to add something like um
06:01 - baked actually let's add something like
06:05 - beans and then we press ok and that
06:08 - beans right now is stored in array 0 so
06:12 - now it runs through the loop again add
06:13 - something to the array and add something
06:15 - like candy so we press ok and now candy
06:19 - is stored in array 1 and now this is the
06:22 - last time it's going to run it says add
06:25 - something to the array and we add
06:26 - something like dogs and press ok and
06:30 - when we press ok that's going to be
06:32 - stored in crap
06:34 - so now we have um beans and zero candy
06:38 - and one dogs in two so then whenever we
06:41 - print it out zero one and two it printed
06:45 - out our filled array so that's pretty
06:47 - cool and I know I could have probably
06:49 - add some spaces there maybe some wine
06:51 - breaks but again this is just a quick
06:53 - example showing you how to have the user
06:56 - populate an array using a for loop so if
07:00 - you understood that then you got the
07:02 - main idea of one why an array is useful
07:05 - into why loops are useful and there are
07:08 - a lot of different techniques that you
07:10 - can use using an array and loops and not
07:13 - only arm entering information but
07:16 - they're also really useful when printing
07:18 - out information so again the most common
07:22 - technique that I want to stress is this
07:24 - use the array index as the counter so
07:29 - that is a very popular technique so once
07:31 - you get the hang of that you take your
07:33 - array skills to a whole new level so for
07:36 - now thank you guys for watching
07:37 - hopefully you understand what prompt is
07:40 - and also how to loop through arrays
07:42 - using a for loop so lastly thank you
07:45 - guys for watching one more time don't
07:46 - forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
07:47 - later
