00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 36th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - I'm going to talk to you guys about
00:06 - something called a
00:07 - multi-dimensional array now a
00:09 - multi-dimensional array is basically an
00:12 - array inside another array so yeah think
00:16 - about that for a little bit and get
00:17 - freaked out you might be thinking whoa
00:19 - this reminds me of inception a Dream
00:22 - Within A Dream what's going on and you
00:24 - guys are thinking oh man this tutorial
00:26 - is going to be super confusing I barely
00:28 - even understand arrays and now going to
00:30 - say an array inside an array all right
00:33 - well here is an easier way to think
00:34 - about it if you ever you know use
00:38 - Microsoft Excel or maybe use uh
00:41 - MySQL think of it as a database or a
00:44 - table a multi-dimensional array is
00:47 - basically made up of rows and columns so
00:50 - this is the easiest way where you can
00:52 - think of it and it's basically whenever
00:54 - someone has uh information and they want
00:56 - to organize it in rows and columns they
00:58 - use a multi-dimensional array so let's
01:01 - go ahead and create one right now and
01:02 - I'll show you guys the Syntax for it go
01:04 - ahead and pretend you're creating a
01:06 - basic array I'm going to name m Sally
01:09 - and instead of a one square bracket it
01:11 - actually takes two square brackets in
01:14 - the first square bracket you write how
01:16 - many rows do you want to have in your
01:18 - array let's let's keep it simple and say
01:20 - we want to have an array with two rows
01:23 - and for the second one is basically
01:24 - columns how many columns do you want to
01:27 - have in your array so let's go ahead and
01:29 - add three columns so now we have a row
01:33 - excuse me now we have basically a table
01:35 - that's two rows by three columns AKA
01:38 - there are six elements in this array so
01:41 - in order to create um an array inside an
01:45 - array it's basically exactly like you
01:47 - would think go ahead and make your array
01:50 - and just to tell you guys this code
01:52 - blocks gets freaked out whenever you try
01:54 - to put uh squarely brackets inside other
01:56 - squarely brackets so that's why uh it
01:59 - might be messing up when you try typing
02:00 - it but anyways go ahead and as the first
02:04 - element in your array you actually add
02:07 - an array so let's go ahead and add two
02:09 - three 4 so check it out we have an array
02:14 - 2 3 4 inside another array and this
02:18 - smaller array is the first row so now
02:21 - let's go ahead and make our second row
02:22 - or second array add a comma
02:25 - and like I said uh code blocks gets
02:28 - freaked out whenever you try to do it so
02:30 - it might be weird but let's go ahead and
02:32 - in this array put 8 9 and 10 so we
02:37 - basically made two different arrays one
02:40 - array is 23
02:42 - 4 and the other array is 8
02:45 - 910 so we said all right we're creating
02:49 - a multi-dimensional array consisting of
02:51 - two different arrays each array is a row
02:55 - and each value is going to be a column
02:57 - and remember to separate your arrays
03:00 - with a comma so basically this is an
03:02 - array made up of two smaller arrays so
03:06 - let me go ahead and draw this for you
03:07 - guys visually like I said there are two
03:09 - different rows one is two three and four
03:13 - and the other one is eight 9 and 10 so
03:17 - visually this is what our array looks
03:20 - like this is all one array that's
03:22 - basically made up of this array 2 3 and
03:25 - four and this array 8 n and 10 2 three
03:28 - and four is on top 8 n tens on bottom
03:31 - two
03:32 - rows three columns pretty simple huh so
03:36 - anyways the basics of this is anytime
03:38 - you want to create a multi-dimensional
03:40 - array go ahead and list number of rows
03:43 - number of columns and for the number of
03:45 - rows that's how many arrays you create
03:48 - and for the number of columns that's how
03:50 - many values you add to each array and
03:52 - then you end up with something like this
03:54 - so if you're saying all right now how do
03:56 - I reference you know how do I get to
03:59 - each element in that array well let's go
04:01 - ahead and just print it out on the
04:02 - screen um of course print out Sally and
04:05 - whenever you reference it it just takes
04:07 - the two brackets the first index you
04:10 - need is what row is it in and remember
04:13 - the first row starts with zero so
04:15 - anytime we want to access the element in
04:17 - this first row we need to go ahead and
04:19 - put zero now remember two is going to be
04:22 - zero 3 is going to be one and four is
04:26 - going to be two so if you write 02 it's
04:29 - going to look look at the zero with row
04:31 - which is the first run and the second
04:33 - element which is actually 0 1 2 so it's
04:37 - going to go zero 2 and that's going to
04:40 - give us our four it's basically just
04:42 - like coordinates I don't know why I
04:44 - didn't say that before I didn't cross my
04:45 - mind but basically multi-dimensional
04:48 - arrays are exactly like coordinates you
04:51 - RIS the coordinate here start with zero
04:53 - and the coordinate here so if we want to
04:55 - reference N9 that would be 0 1 so go
04:59 - ahead type one for that and
05:02 - 01 right there so that let's go ahead
05:06 - and print that out and I got my nine so
05:09 - basically a multi-dimensional array just
05:12 - like Inception is an array or more than
05:16 - one array inside a bigger array it's
05:18 - pretty much an array made up of arrays
05:21 - instead of values and what it does is it
05:24 - gives you the idea that you can create a
05:26 - table basically made up of rows and
05:30 - columns and anytime you want to access
05:32 - one of the elements you just go ahead
05:34 - and type in the coordinates which would
05:36 - be the row
05:38 - number and then the column number and
05:41 - you print it out and there you
05:43 - go so if you guys understand this then
05:47 - you're ready to move on to my next Topic
05:49 - in the next tutorial I'm going to teach
05:50 - you guys a really simple way to print
05:53 - out a multi-dimensional array so instead
05:55 - of you know just having to commment this
05:57 - right here um you have a nice visual of
06:00 - what it looks like so if you guys uh
06:03 - don't understand it then go ahead and
06:04 - just go to my forum and ask me a
06:06 - question and I'll explain it better
06:07 - there but if you do or you know maybe if
06:10 - you got any good Inception jokes then
06:12 - leave them in the comments below but for
06:13 - now thank you guys for watching don't
06:15 - forget to subscribe and I will see you
06:16 - in the next tutorial
