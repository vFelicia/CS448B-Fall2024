00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - taking a look at by riff now if you
00:09 - remember from the previous tutorial we
00:11 - took a look at by Val which is passing a
00:14 - variable to a sub or a function so that
00:17 - it can use that value inside of the sub
00:19 - or function but that value is not
00:21 - changed outside of the sub so with bar F
00:25 - what you can do is reference a variable
00:28 - that is outside of you outside of your
00:30 - sub or function and change it so that it
00:33 - will change anywhere else in your
00:35 - program from where you call the sub or
00:37 - function now this may be this may be a
00:39 - little confusing to you so let's go
00:41 - ahead and create a demo application
00:44 - we'll go ahead and select new project we
00:50 - will call it by ref select windows forms
00:55 - application and click OK
00:57 - so we'll wait for that to load and now
01:00 - let's go ahead and come over here to our
01:02 - toolbox we'll add a label and we will
01:07 - set the label to no value entered and
01:15 - then we'll set the name of the label to
01:19 - label variable ok so so let's go ahead
01:23 - and double click on form 1 to open up
01:26 - our code and we'll zoom in here ok so
01:30 - now what we're going to do is we are
01:31 - going to create a variable inside of our
01:34 - form one load sub so-dimm num1 as
01:40 - integer and we will set it equal to zero
01:44 - now let's go ahead and show that in the
01:47 - message box message box dot show num 1.2
01:52 - string now I haven't used to string in a
01:54 - while but it's always good to use that
01:56 - whenever you're putting numbers on
01:58 - labels or message boxes or anywhere that
02:01 - uses a string as the argument now what
02:05 - we're going to do is we are going to
02:07 - make a sub that will increment number
02:10 - so we'll start off by using the keyword
02:12 - private sub and then we'll call this
02:16 - increment variable now inside of the
02:23 - arguments for increment variable we're
02:25 - going to use by ref and then we'll just
02:28 - do num1 as integer so what this is going
02:33 - to do is it's going to let us reference
02:35 - a variable now we don't have to use the
02:37 - value we don't have to use the name num1
02:39 - it can be anything so we can just do X
02:41 - and whatever we put in the argument is
02:44 - going to be referenced and inside of
02:46 - this sub it's going to be called
02:47 - whatever variable is right here which is
02:49 - X so we can go ahead and do X plus
02:53 - equals 5 or not 1 5 now if we come up
02:59 - here and we just call increment variable
03:01 - and pass num1 to that what it's going to
03:06 - do is it's going to add 5 to this num1
03:08 - right here because we're referencing it
03:11 - and not sending a copy of it to this sub
03:16 - so we can do message box dot show num 1
03:22 - dot 2 string let's go ahead and change
03:27 - our label accordingly
03:28 - so we'll do label variable dot text
03:32 - equals num 1 dot 2 string and we'll go
03:39 - ahead and do that one more time after
03:40 - this dot text equals num 1 dot 2 string
03:48 - okay so let's go ahead and run our
03:50 - program and see what happens so you can
03:55 - see that we get the value 0 right here
03:57 - and then if we click OK we're going to
04:00 - get the value 5 because we used
04:02 - increment variable and it referenced
04:05 - num1 right here and if we go ahead and
04:08 - click OK you can see that will load the
04:09 - form and it sets the label to 5 now all
04:13 - of this was done before the form
04:15 - unloaded so you don't actually see it
04:17 - set the value of 0 to the to the label
04:22 - so thanks for watching guys go ahead and
04:26 - make a couple subs or functions or
04:28 - whatever you want that use by ref so
04:31 - that you can reference other variables
04:33 - that are inside of other subs you can
04:35 - also combine by ref and by Val in
04:38 - arguments so you could have by RF XS
04:40 - integer and then by Val Y as integer and
04:43 - you can mix and match these any way you
04:46 - want
04:46 - so go ahead practice some of that and
04:48 - once you you're familiar with that and
04:50 - you're not going to forget it go ahead
04:51 - and move on to the next tutorial
