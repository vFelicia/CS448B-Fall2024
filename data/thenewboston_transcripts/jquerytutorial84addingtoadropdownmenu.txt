00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - now in the last couple of videos we've
00:07 - looked at aend and append two however
00:10 - now we're going to take a look at an
00:11 - example application which is going to
00:13 - use append to append things to a
00:15 - dropdown list uh an HTML dropdown list
00:19 - so essentially what we're doing is we're
00:21 - creating a series of links so Three
00:24 - Links and when these links are clicked
00:26 - the value of these links will be added
00:29 - to the drop down box to create each
00:31 - option as we go so this is an example uh
00:36 - of the script um when we click on uh
00:39 - bread sugar or tea uh so if we click on
00:42 - bread it will then become uh available
00:44 - in this drop- down list when we click on
00:46 - sugar it will also become available in
00:48 - this drop- down list because we're
00:49 - appending an option uh onto the end of
00:52 - the select element in HTML so let's take
00:55 - a look at uh the
00:57 - code now we have aend Js including Ed in
01:00 - our file that's extremely important
01:02 - we're going to be writing out the code
01:03 - inside of there it's extremely short but
01:05 - it's a much a better example uh than
01:08 - just showing a pending normal
01:11 - text it makes uh the you know overall
01:15 - use of this uh seem a lot more useful in
01:18 - uh everyday
01:19 - applications okay so let's first of all
01:21 - create our links so I'm going to create
01:24 - these just inside a paragraph tag
01:30 - we can copy and paste them uh so the
01:32 - first one I'll just put
01:33 - bread and the HF is
01:36 - nothing the class of this is going to be
01:39 - link as is all the others so we're going
01:42 - to keep the same class name but we're
01:44 - going to use uh the this keyword to
01:47 - reference each object so the next will
01:49 - be sugar and then we
01:52 - have t so we've used the class link and
01:56 - what this is going to do is it's going
01:57 - to identify all of these as clickable
02:00 - links we're going to call uh an event
02:02 - handler in append JS to check for the
02:05 - clicking of these links we're then going
02:07 - to use the
02:10 - text attribute to actually take the text
02:14 - uh inside from this link and then we're
02:16 - going to add it to a uh drop- down box
02:19 - just here let's go ahead and create this
02:21 - drop down box I'm going to say um give
02:25 - it a name of
02:26 - list and then end the selection there
02:29 - now we don't need to provide any options
02:31 - in here because what's going to be
02:32 - happening is these op or these options
02:34 - that you would usually usually specify
02:37 - are going to be appended on for us So
02:40 - eventually we're going to end up with a
02:41 - list that looks like
02:44 - this with bread sugar and tea however
02:49 - we're going to let jQuery do this for us
02:51 - as we click the list so essentially what
02:53 - the user is doing is defining their own
02:56 - list okay so let's go ahead and look at
02:58 - the code we first first of all need to
03:00 - create an event handler for each of
03:02 - these links so we've called this link uh
03:04 - this class
03:05 - link so for each one of these links we
03:08 - can use do link and when we click on one
03:11 - of these links we want to carry out a
03:16 - function let's bring that down a bit so
03:19 - inside of this function we want to first
03:21 - of all take the value uh from the link
03:24 - itself so I'm going to create a variable
03:26 - called item now we need to go ahead and
03:29 - reference the
03:31 - um actual link itself however we can't
03:34 - use Link because I'll show you what
03:35 - happens let's go ahead and
03:39 - choose link and then we use the Val
03:43 - function to grab the value from oh no
03:45 - sorry we use the do text to grab the
03:48 - value from this link now you'll see what
03:51 - happens in this case when we click on an
03:52 - element oh let's uh see what we've done
03:56 - wrong here
04:00 - okay yeah so we need to alert
04:02 - out item for
04:05 - debugging okay so now that we've alerted
04:07 - that out let's go ahead and click on a
04:08 - link now you can see that we've got
04:10 - bread sugar and tea combined this is
04:12 - because we can't refer to this as do
04:15 - link because we have the same element
04:17 - name for each one or the element class
04:20 - for each one and therefore we just use
04:23 - this and this just takes the currently
04:25 - clicked um element so now what we do is
04:28 - when we click sugar we have the value
04:30 - sugar when we click tea we have the
04:32 - value tea when we click bread we have
04:34 - the value
04:35 - bread so now that we know that this item
04:38 - holds the currently clicked this item
04:40 - variable holds the currently clicked
04:42 - value we can go ahead and do something
04:45 - with
04:46 - it so obviously what we want to do is
04:49 - append this to the options inside of
04:51 - this select uh list so we're going to
04:55 - need to use the append um manipulator in
04:58 - jQuery so we're going to go ahead and
05:01 - say list remember we called our list
05:05 - list then we're going to say dot
05:10 - append and what do we want to append on
05:13 - well we want to append on the item
05:15 - however this isn't valid HTML if we were
05:18 - to use the list like this click sugar
05:20 - nothing really happens uh because we
05:22 - haven't chosen the option um tags around
05:25 - it so what we need to do is we need to
05:27 - create some option tags
05:31 - so we're appending on uh the item after
05:34 - this option tag here using the plus and
05:37 - then we go ahead and plus the ending
05:40 - option tag so earlier I showed you like
05:43 - this code
05:44 - here inside this code here and what
05:48 - we're doing is every time we click on a
05:50 - link this is app pending down until we
05:52 - have filled the list okay so let's go
05:55 - ahead and test this in our browser let's
05:57 - just bring that up a bit
06:01 - when we click bread now you can see that
06:03 - the element has been added or the option
06:05 - element has been added inside of here
06:06 - and we now have bread in the drop- down
06:08 - list when I click sugar that's added to
06:11 - the list as well and then when I click
06:13 - tea That's finally added to the list we
06:16 - can obviously then go and add uh the
06:18 - same one over again however you could
06:20 - probably kind of try and come up with a
06:22 - way to check the current elements in
06:24 - there and then maybe put at times two on
06:27 - the end of it that's not for this
06:29 - tutorial but that's a more uh useful
06:31 - example of the append um manipulation in
06:34 - jQuery
