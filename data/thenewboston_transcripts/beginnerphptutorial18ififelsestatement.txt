00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' de
00:02 - org and in this video for the new Boston
00:05 - we are going to be looking at if
00:07 - statements within PHP now an if
00:09 - statement is a statement that lets us to
00:13 - compare or not compare or evaluate and
00:17 - something whether it's true or false and
00:20 - act on that for example in real-life
00:23 - situations you would say if I did this
00:25 - there would be an outcome or otherwise
00:28 - if I didn't do this there would be
00:30 - another outcome and we can demonstrate
00:32 - this I'm going to show you the syntax
00:34 - first of all and this is just simply if
00:37 - and then we have two brackets where our
00:40 - statement to be evaluated goes inside
00:42 - here here and then we start a curly
00:46 - bracket we come down a few lines and we
00:48 - end a curly bracket then what we do is
00:53 - we basically come in and Pat our
00:56 - statement in here so for now I'm going
00:58 - to say if one now true so the way this
01:05 - reads is if one echo true now one by
01:09 - itself is a statement within programming
01:12 - in general that will evaluate to true
01:14 - it's a it's there it's one equals one
01:18 - it's one is no other there's no
01:20 - comparison it just equals true otherwise
01:27 - we equal or we echo sorry folks
01:31 - okay so we're basically saying if one on
01:35 - its own if this is true we execute this
01:39 - block here this is called a block
01:41 - otherwise by using the else keyword
01:44 - execute this block here what's
01:46 - highlighted in blue at the moment is a
01:47 - block so this is how we write it out you
01:50 - might see it sometimes written like this
01:53 - this is a lot of an easier way to read
01:55 - it and if you're new to programming it
01:59 - doesn't matter how you write it
02:00 - but generally I write like this so this
02:05 - block here will be executed if one is
02:09 - true which it is and it always is and
02:12 - otherwise this block here will be
02:14 - executed so let's just run this in our
02:16 - browser and see what happens
02:17 - we have been displayed with the text
02:20 - true because this is true now what about
02:23 - if 0 now you can probably guess that 0
02:27 - is an automatic false one is true and 0
02:31 - is false so in this instance putting a 0
02:34 - in we're evaluating 0 is 0 true or false
02:37 - it's false so we should be displayed
02:39 - with the text false the same as if we
02:42 - were to write true this would equal true
02:47 - and if we were to type in false this is
02:51 - equal to false now this is pretty boring
02:54 - we want to start making some comparisons
02:56 - inside so I'm just going to use an
02:58 - example of one of the comparison
03:00 - operators which is double equals and
03:02 - this means is equal to and it looks like
03:05 - this and either side of it you're going
03:08 - to do your values to compare so I want
03:10 - to say does 1 equal 1
03:12 - now this reads as does 1 or is 1 equal
03:17 - to 1 and because 1 is equal to 1 we're
03:20 - going to be executing this block if one
03:23 - wasn't equal to 1 we'd be executing this
03:25 - block so let's just run that and that's
03:29 - true now I'm going to change this to
03:32 - does 1 it is 1 equal to 2 and obviously
03:36 - that is false so you can see how this
03:38 - block here this is called an if
03:40 - else statement because we're using the
03:42 - keywords if and we're using the keywords
03:45 - else you can have an if statement just
03:47 - on its own if if it doesn't happen to
03:51 - equal true we just in this case not
03:53 - going to output anything because there's
03:56 - no else to tell us what to do otherwise
03:58 - so now let's just return back to that
04:02 - now what we can do is we can start
04:04 - saying things like if and we can have a
04:07 - variable up here that's what it will say
04:11 - text equals let's say something
04:19 - so if text equals something echo true in
04:27 - this case we will be echoing out true to
04:29 - the screen because it is true otherwise
04:35 - echo false so now what I can do is
04:37 - change this to let's say something else
04:42 - it doesn't equal that so we're going to
04:45 - be displayed with false so that is the
04:47 - basic structure and the use of an if
04:50 - statement we have this is basically
04:52 - called an if-else statement so we've got
04:55 - if-else and depending on whether this
04:58 - statement here is evaluated to true or
05:01 - false we echo out the corresponding
05:03 - block
