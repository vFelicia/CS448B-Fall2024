00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the New Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at dates so in Visual
00:10 - Basic there is a class called date and
00:13 - you can create objects with that and use
00:15 - that to get the current date you can
00:17 - also format this in several different
00:19 - ways so we're just going to make a
00:21 - little demo application that will show
00:24 - us what we can do with some of the date
00:26 - functions so we'll select windows forms
00:30 - application and we'll set the name to
00:32 - dates and once that's loaded we'll come
00:37 - over here to our toolbox and we will add
00:41 - a button
00:44 - so we'll just resize this a little bit
00:47 - and also the text of button one to show
00:52 - date and we will set the name to button
00:57 - show date okay so now we're going to do
01:01 - is we're going to go ahead and double
01:03 - click on show date so what we can do is
01:07 - zoom in here a little bit first so what
01:13 - we can do is create an object of the
01:15 - date class so we'll go ahead and type
01:18 - dim current date as anyway type date if
01:25 - you read the description it says
01:27 - represents an instant in time typically
01:29 - expressed as date and time of day so it
01:32 - will go ahead and get the time that the
01:37 - current date the year of the month the
01:40 - minutes the hours the seconds every part
01:43 - of the time it's going to get that so go
01:45 - ahead and set that equal to a value so
01:48 - current date equals now so you can see
01:53 - it says public read-only property now as
01:55 - date returns the data value containing
01:58 - the current date and time according to
01:59 - your system so it's going to go ahead
02:01 - and get the date and time on the user
02:06 - system so whatever machine it's running
02:08 - on is going to get their time and it's
02:09 - not going to use a
02:10 - pacified time now you so let's go ahead
02:14 - and output the the current date in a
02:17 - message box so we'll type message box
02:20 - dot show and we will just take our date
02:24 - and convert it to a string so current
02:27 - date dot two string and let's go ahead
02:30 - set the title to date application now
02:37 - let's go ahead and run this and see what
02:38 - happens
02:42 - so here's our form and when we click
02:44 - show date it gives us May 9th 2011 at
02:48 - 7:01 p.m. and 8 seconds so if we keep
02:53 - clicking this you can see that updates
02:55 - according to the current time because
03:01 - every time we click it it creates a new
03:03 - date and sets it to now so if we click
03:05 - it it's got 28 seconds wait a couple
03:07 - seconds click it again and it's got 31
03:09 - now what we can also do is we can
03:12 - convert the current date to another
03:15 - format so let's say you don't want the
03:17 - month the day the year and everything in
03:19 - there so we can do is we type current
03:22 - date dot 2 short time string so while
03:28 - this is going to do is going to convert
03:29 - it to a short time string and what that
03:33 - means is that it's just going to show
03:34 - the time 701 p.m. now there are many
03:37 - other things that you can do with this
03:39 - you can do dot to long time string let's
03:43 - go ahead and run this we'll click show
03:46 - date and we get the seconds as well as
03:49 - the hour and minute and you can see that
03:51 - it does not update in real time so I'm
03:54 - going to close out of that and we can go
03:56 - ahead and look at some of the other
03:58 - stuffs that we can do so if you just
04:00 - type a dot you can see that we've got
04:01 - two short time string two short date
04:04 - string two zero eight date two long time
04:08 - string and two long date string they
04:10 - string so you can go ahead and play
04:15 - around with those see what those do see
04:17 - what happens when you type those in and
04:20 - once you've practiced a little bit with
04:22 - date and date objects go ahead and move
04:25 - on to the next tutorial
