00:00 - so we've got name size type and
00:02 - temporary name not all of these are
00:04 - required to actually upload the file and
00:06 - the ones that are not required to upload
00:08 - the file are this this an in fact named
00:11 - but what we want to do is we want to
00:12 - keep the same name as the file and as
00:16 - we've uploaded here so we need in this
00:19 - case temporary name and the name of the
00:22 - file so underneath here what I'm going
00:24 - to do the first thing I need to do is
00:26 - check whether we've actually chosen a
00:30 - file and we've submitted the form so we
00:32 - can do this we're with the is set
00:34 - function so I can say if is set name and
00:39 - in fact you can incorporate others in
00:41 - there but I'm just going to be assuming
00:43 - that the the file has a name which it
00:45 - would do in most cases so if is set name
00:48 - what we then do in hid inside here is we
00:51 - can echo out something just to test so
00:54 - okay for example so if we come back to
00:57 - our form as it is and we don't select a
01:00 - file and I click Submit oh okay oh yeah
01:03 - sorry it is set so if it's set name then
01:07 - we need to do another check saying if
01:09 - not empty name do something otherwise do
01:15 - something else so here we can just say
01:18 - please choose a file otherwise we can
01:23 - say everything's ok because this will
01:26 - presume that we've selected a file from
01:27 - our computer we've clicked the submit
01:29 - button the two if statements have
01:31 - validated to true if the file is first
01:34 - of all if the form has been submitted
01:35 - and second of all if the file has a name
01:38 - which you presume it will do if that
01:40 - user select a file so let's just go on
01:45 - we won't choose a file for now but back
01:47 - to the page that is click Submit and
01:49 - it's telling me please choose a file now
01:51 - what I'm going to do is actually choose
01:52 - a file click Submit and it's telling us
01:55 - it's ok
01:55 - so this is the some basic form or
01:59 - validation to make sure the file is here
02:01 - now what do we do with the file once we
02:04 - know it's there and we've performed
02:06 - these couple of checks well what we need
02:08 - to do is we need to move the file from
02:11 - its temporary location
02:12 - to a specified location and this
02:15 - specified location is in the uploads
02:22 - folder okay so I'm just going to put
02:24 - uploads and then a foot and then a
02:26 - trailing forward slash now what we need
02:29 - to do is we need to use a function
02:33 - called move uploaded file and we need to
02:37 - give it two parameters the first one is
02:38 - the temporary location which is
02:41 - temporary name in fact before we do all
02:44 - this let's just kill the page there and
02:46 - echo out the temporary name so you can
02:49 - get a general idea of where it's being
02:51 - stored so let's just pick that file
02:53 - there and click Submit you can see that
02:55 - this is being stored in C colon
02:56 - backslash xampp' temp and it's and the
02:59 - file name is PHP C to 790 MP this is the
03:04 - file that we've just uploaded however
03:06 - it's in an unusable format and it's not
03:09 - in the location we want it in so let's
03:11 - get rid of that and we won't kill our
03:13 - page anymore so move uploaded file you
03:16 - need the temporary name as the first
03:17 - argument to this function and the second
03:20 - is the location so I'm going to say
03:22 - location now we do need to add something
03:26 - else on to this we need to give it a
03:27 - name so fair enough we're uploading to
03:29 - the uploads folder but now what we need
03:32 - to do is append on the end of it a file
03:34 - name here now obviously we already have
03:38 - the file name so we don't need to
03:39 - specify that ourselves it's just simply
03:42 - name because we're taking the file name
03:44 - of the file we've uploaded so to make
03:48 - this to make sure this works a bit
03:49 - better I'm going to enclose this
03:51 - function in an if statement and then if
03:53 - the file is successfully uploaded I'm
03:55 - just going to echo upload it okay so now
03:59 - let's test this out let's go back to our
04:01 - plot PHP I'm going to click Submit and
04:03 - it's telling me to please choose a file
04:05 - so that's just testing our validation
04:06 - I'm going to choose this image called
04:08 - words Lee underscore Nicollet one jpg
04:11 - and if we go back to our that will just
04:15 - quickly go back to our folder and make
04:18 - sure there's nothing in history
04:21 - so let's choose that file and click
04:24 - Submit and it says uploaded so we've Pro
04:26 - says to everything that we've written
04:27 - already with no error now for the
04:30 - interesting part let's go back and have
04:31 - a look this uploads folder and see if
04:34 - it's uploaded and in actual fact it has
04:36 - so we've clicked you can click on this
04:38 - and preview in our browser but we've
04:40 - successfully uploaded a file now let me
04:42 - just take you through the stages again
04:43 - we grab the name of the file itself
04:45 - which is here here and we have the
04:49 - temporary name or this is the temporary
04:51 - location rather then what we do is we're
04:54 - checking if the form has been submitted
04:55 - then we check if then we check if the
05:00 - file exists so have they selected a file
05:02 - we specify a location in a variable
05:05 - which is the uploads folder so this
05:06 - corresponds to the folder here and then
05:12 - what we do is we say if this is
05:14 - successful if this function is
05:15 - successful and while we're performing
05:17 - this if statement where we're calling it
05:20 - as well so we're uploading from the
05:22 - temporary name and we're renaming it
05:24 - into this location with this file name
05:26 - here so obviously I could say I could
05:30 - specify here let's put it in uploads
05:32 - forward slash image dot jpg ok so now
05:37 - what I could do is click on upload dot
05:39 - PHP select a different file click Submit
05:42 - and you'll see that it will have put it
05:44 - into the exact location I've specified
05:46 - there however what we want to do is we
05:49 - want to do it based on the file that the
05:51 - user is uploading and obviously I've
05:53 - just stored this in in a different
05:55 - variable then we echo uploaded if that's
05:57 - ok and we could obviously add something
06:00 - here to say and
06:03 - there was an error now so this is how to
06:07 - basically upload a file as you can see
06:09 - there's sort of a lot involved with it
06:11 - but it once you get the hang of it it's
06:12 - easy to do however what we haven't done
06:15 - is we haven't performed any validation
06:17 - on the file itself so as it stands I
06:19 - could upload a PHP file I could upload
06:21 - any XE file I could upload anything I
06:23 - basically want so in the next video
06:26 - we're going to be looking at how to
06:28 - secure the form and only allow a JPEG
06:30 - file
