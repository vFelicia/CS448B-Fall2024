00:00 - okay so I've opened up PHP my admin' so
00:03 - we're going to be years of administering
00:05 - our database let's have a look at what
00:07 - we've already got stored now your
00:09 - database could obviously be different
00:10 - you could be using it for different
00:11 - purposes mine is a basic login database
00:16 - so this information that's stored about
00:17 - users is going to help us log in now
00:20 - that's irrelevant for now we've got an
00:21 - ID of six for Alex and an ID of seven
00:24 - for Dale now this is a unique
00:26 - incrementing value so what we could now
00:29 - do is modify our generate PHP file to
00:31 - take in a user's ID and what that's
00:34 - going to do is it's going to return
00:36 - their email address as we have just by
00:39 - typing it in here so let's just close
00:42 - the source on here so the first thing we
00:46 - need to do is connect to our database so
00:48 - let's go ahead and just quickly connect
00:49 - to our database we're going to say MySQL
00:53 - connect now this is very rough so don't
00:56 - follow my example in this sense and
00:59 - there is another tutorial about
01:01 - connecting to a database so root MySQL
01:05 - select dB
01:08 - so what we're doing now is we're
01:09 - selecting the database which I believe
01:10 - is called a underscore database so a
01:15 - underscore database now let's perform a
01:19 - query and this is going to be MySQL
01:22 - query and we can say select email so
01:27 - we're selecting the email field which is
01:29 - here so select email from so what our
01:38 - our tables called oops sorry our tables
01:40 - called users so let's select email from
01:43 - users
01:46 - we're ID equals and we want to specify
01:53 - the ID of the user and that's going to
01:58 - be taken in let's copy and paste this up
02:02 - here so query equals MySQL query select
02:08 - now so that ID here is going to be we'll
02:11 - just call this ID for now and what I'm
02:13 - going to do is add some just some
02:14 - security on to this so I'm going to
02:16 - enclose this in my MySQL real escape
02:19 - string to help prevent SQL injection
02:25 - okay so if is set get and this time
02:29 - we're going to get the value ID and
02:32 - we're now going to say ID equals dollar
02:35 - underscore get ID so now let's let me
02:40 - briefly take you through what I've done
02:41 - I've connected to the database using my
02:43 - over connected to the server the MySQL
02:46 - server using my credentials then I've
02:48 - selected my database now I'm checking
02:50 - for an ID input the idea is going to
02:54 - equal the input that we've specified
02:55 - using our get otherwise email is going
02:58 - to say no email specified once again so
03:01 - down here what we can do is perform our
03:03 - query which we've performed now we
03:05 - should retrieve some information back so
03:07 - I'm going to say query result is equal
03:10 - to MySQL result now we can specify the
03:16 - query that we executed and we can also
03:19 - specify the row which is going to be 0
03:22 - because we're only going to retrieve one
03:24 - row and then the field here so that's
03:26 - going to be email so the query that we
03:29 - performed here the row which is going to
03:32 - be the 0 row which is the only row
03:34 - that's been returned and email there so
03:37 - what we could do is have checks in here
03:39 - to check if this exists so if the ID
03:41 - exists I suppose we could quickly do
03:43 - that now if MySQL num rows query is
03:51 - greater than or equal to 1 which it will
03:54 - never be great at the moment we can
03:55 - include this check anyway this
03:57 - comparator
03:57 - anyway and do then get the result
04:01 - otherwise email equals ID not found now
04:10 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
04:11 - change the change the name of this query
04:14 - here this variable here I mean to email
04:17 - because the value that we're returning
04:19 - from this MySQL a result function is
04:22 - going to be the email address of the
04:24 - user
04:24 - therefore now what's going to happen is
04:26 - our script is going to run as normal so
04:28 - let's go through this again just so you
04:30 - make sure you entirely understand we're
04:32 - connecting to our database or connecting
04:33 - to our server selecting our database
04:35 - checking if this ID value which we
04:38 - previously had let's go back to our
04:40 - source we previously had as email equals
04:44 - this will now read ID equals and then
04:47 - we're going to specify a specific ID
04:49 - then the ID variable here is equal to
04:52 - what we've specified otherwise email
04:54 - equals no more specified as we did
04:56 - before now what we're doing is
04:58 - performing a query in fact we're going
05:03 - to perform this query here inside here
05:08 - because otherwise there's no need to
05:11 - continue and we'll change this to no IDs
05:16 - specified so sorry if that's confused to
05:18 - let's bring this down to make make it a
05:19 - bit easier to read so if if we have set
05:22 - this ID thing then we complete a query
05:24 - so query is selecting email selecting
05:27 - one field from the users table where our
05:30 - ID equals the ID that we've specified so
05:33 - i ID up here ID up there MySQL real
05:36 - escape string for a bit of security
05:37 - against SQL injection now we're checking
05:40 - if the rows returned are bigger greater
05:44 - than or equal to 1 so if they are
05:47 - greater than equal to 1 which means that
05:48 - we have successfully retrieved an email
05:50 - value we retrieve this value by using
05:52 - the MySQL result function now query that
05:55 - we've run up here 0 row which is the
05:58 - only road that's been returned and we're
06:01 - retrieving the email field otherwise
06:04 - email equals ID not found then we come
06:07 - down here
06:08 - and we do our checks as I've already
06:10 - explained in the tutorial so let's test
06:13 - this out after that long mouthful of
06:16 - explaining let's go back to index dot
06:18 - PHP let's first of all not specify and
06:22 - see if we returned with the correct
06:24 - error you'll see no ID specified so now
06:28 - let's go in and say ID equals now the ID
06:31 - that we have in the database the two IDs
06:33 - we have six and seven so let's specify
06:35 - this to 10 because that doesn't exist so
06:37 - he should when we refresh our page
06:40 - retrieve the result saying that we the
06:44 - idea is not being found
06:45 - so ID not found so that's fine it works
06:48 - now let's go back and do it sensibly so
06:51 - we can say six now what this should now
06:53 - do is retrieve the email address of user
06:55 - 6 and that is Alex at some domain comm
06:59 - so let's go over to our page and refresh
07:02 - and we retrieve Alex at some domain.com
07:06 - so not only we're converting this to
07:08 - text we're securely doing it because now
07:10 - if we look at our page source the email
07:13 - address doesn't exist anywhere in this
07:15 - code okay so our bots are going to find
07:19 - it harder to pick up a plain text email
07:22 - value so let's just try it with seven
07:24 - which is Dale's email address and then
07:26 - the tutorial will be over so let's
07:29 - refresh and you can see that's changed
07:30 - to Dale at some domain.com
07:32 - so that's a little bit about why you
07:34 - should use this method as much as
07:37 - possible and a really quick and easy way
07:39 - to do it play around with a code make it
07:42 - your own change colors change font sizes
07:45 - and I wish you the best of luck with
07:48 - creating this and because our functions
07:51 - do get a bit tricky
