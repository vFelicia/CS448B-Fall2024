00:00 - um once that is downloaded I'm just
00:02 - going to cancel this cuz I've already
00:03 - got it installed so uh once it is
00:05 - downloaded what you want to do is you
00:07 - want to uh run through the installation
00:09 - process um hopefully you won't get any
00:11 - errors if you do get any errors go on to
00:13 - xamp um and see if you can find any
00:16 - support follow the instructions for
00:18 - installation um and once you've
00:20 - installed um we're going to get to the
00:22 - point that I'm going to talk to you now
00:24 - in the video so uh if you'd like to
00:26 - pause the video or uh or close whatever
00:29 - um in install examp and um we're going
00:32 - to go ahead and test
00:35 - everything okay so hopefully now you
00:37 - have examp installed um I haven't talked
00:40 - to you about what we're going to do next
00:42 - but what we're actually going to do is
00:44 - we're going to open up something called
00:46 - the xamp control panel application now
00:49 - what or the xamp control panel now what
00:52 - this is is it's a control panel for your
00:54 - uh services that are included with xamp
00:56 - I'm not sure what version of xamp I'm
00:59 - running at the moment uh but is a
01:00 - slightly older version so depending on
01:02 - when you've completed the
01:04 - installation um this video was recorded
01:07 - 2011 so depending on when you're viewing
01:09 - this video uh your control panel may
01:11 - look a bit different but nevertheless
01:13 - control panel is available from uh your
01:16 - programs menu within windows so open
01:19 - this up and what you want to do is you
01:20 - want to make sure Apache and MySQL are
01:23 - running for most cases you're going to
01:25 - be using uh well for all cases you're
01:27 - going to be using Apache but for some
01:28 - tutorials and for database usage you're
01:30 - going to be using MySQL so make sure
01:33 - these two are running if they're not
01:35 - running they'll look something like
01:41 - this yeah okay oh so they're going to
01:43 - look like something like that and uh to
01:46 - start them you're just going to Simply
01:48 - click
01:49 - Start and vice versa if you need to stop
01:51 - them for any reason uh just click stop
01:54 - so now that they're both running um we
01:56 - see here Apache started Port 80 and
01:58 - MySQL started Port
02:00 - 3306 now to access um um Apache and the
02:05 - files that you're going to be creating
02:06 - in PHP uh this is pretty simple with
02:09 - mySQL you're going to be using a web
02:11 - application called PHP my admin admin
02:15 - and this is bundled with examp now PHP
02:17 - well MySQL for stter is a database
02:20 - system you may have heard of it if you
02:21 - haven't already heard of it go to Google
02:23 - read up about it see what it's about you
02:25 - don't need to download it because
02:27 - obviously um what we can see here is
02:28 - bundled with xample already so the first
02:31 - thing we want to do is we want to test
02:33 - if our web server is active now you're
02:36 - not going to be typing any uh domains in
02:39 - here or anything else uh what we're
02:40 - going to be doing is we're going to be
02:42 - typing Local Host okay so it's just it's
02:45 - just simply Local Host so if we press
02:47 - enter hopefully you'll get this screen
02:49 - up so if you have uh got this screen up
02:52 - then uh it's got a little
02:53 - congratulations message you've
02:54 - successfully installed xamp on this
02:56 - server on this system so this will mean
02:58 - that uh xamp is is installed now you can
03:01 - also access it using uh
03:05 - 1271 uh it's entirely up to you but I
03:07 - prefer Local Host personally and that's
03:09 - what I'm going to be using throughout my
03:11 - tutorials now you'll see at the side
03:13 - here you've got things like status
03:15 - security the documentation PHP PHP info
03:18 - function which is going to give you
03:19 - information uh about your uh PHP
03:22 - installation I do have a tutorial
03:24 - separate on this so go ahead and watch
03:25 - that if you want to learn more you've
03:27 - also got some demos here which we're not
03:28 - going to really be discussing
03:30 - in so now that we've got xam
03:32 - successfully installed we want to start
03:34 - running our own uh file so we want to
03:36 - start running creating a PHP file and uh
03:40 - and running this
03:41 - file um so we're going to deal with that
03:43 - in the next part of the tutorial this
03:44 - one's just about installing xamp now um
03:47 - we we need to um now have a look at PHP
03:51 - my admin and what PHP my admin is is uh
03:54 - the administration for your database uh
03:56 - there are tutorials that will take you
03:57 - through this so you just need to know
03:59 - that you can access access it via this
04:00 - link down here and you can see that the
04:02 - address is
04:04 - 1271 PHP myadmin or as we looked at
04:08 - before uh
04:09 - localhost PHP
04:11 - myadmin okay so that works as well so
04:14 - hopefully now you've got xamp up and
04:16 - running uh the next tutorial in the
04:17 - series is going to talk you through how
04:19 - to create your file and where we're
04:21 - going to find uh the place to uh put our
04:23 - file uh to make it uh accessible uh
04:27 - through our now Local web server so
04:29 - we're going to be looking at creating a
04:31 - file in the next tutorial um and
04:33 - displaying it um with the local host
04:35 - address
