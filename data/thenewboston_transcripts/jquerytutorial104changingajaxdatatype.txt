00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new boston
00:05 - now in previous videos we have looked
00:07 - into the Ajax function not as much as
00:11 - possible because there are many many
00:13 - many you know many sort of things based
00:18 - around this this this request there are
00:21 - so many different ways to use it and so
00:23 - many different things we can do with it
00:25 - however for now we've looked at enough
00:28 - so we can actually post data to a page
00:31 - retrieve pages load files etc now one
00:35 - thing that I haven't mentioned is the
00:37 - ability to change the the method I guess
00:41 - as you'd call it in a form an HTML form
00:44 - and this is how the data is sent so we
00:48 - can actually change the way this data is
00:50 - sent from when we pick it up in for
00:53 - example page PHP at the moment I've just
00:56 - created a name variable from a well
01:00 - taking a value from a text field and I'm
01:03 - posting this to page dot PHP the data
01:06 - that I'm supplying is name equals and
01:09 - then I'm supplying this name that has
01:11 - been typed now this will automatically
01:13 - be sent as get data so it will
01:16 - automatically using get data here to
01:19 - post this to page dot PHP therefore
01:22 - inside for example page dot PHP we would
01:25 - have to use dollar underscore get and
01:28 - the name to retrieve this value here
01:32 - however what we can do is we can change
01:35 - the type of request inside of our Ajax
01:39 - request altogether so this is quite
01:43 - simple what we need to do is just come
01:46 - up here and as one of the parameters
01:49 - that we specify to this request we can
01:52 - just specify a type parameter and then
01:55 - obviously we comma seperate is now this
01:57 - can either be get or it can be post so
02:01 - now that we've changed this to post this
02:03 - variable here which almost looks like a
02:06 - get variable I guess will actually be
02:10 - sent as post data so if you're using the
02:13 - age
02:13 - to request and you are we need to send
02:15 - large amounts of data all you need to
02:18 - protect page dot php' against people
02:21 - changing you know values in the URL
02:24 - obviously it's not completely protected
02:26 - because if people can see the variables
02:29 - that you're sending that will always be
02:30 - able to send data there themselves
02:34 - however for these I guess two reasons
02:37 - and they're probably a few others you
02:39 - can change the type to post so with the
02:42 - Ajax request not only can you just
02:44 - default and get you can change type to
02:47 - post to send this same data so you don't
02:50 - there's no need to change the way this
02:52 - data is displayed you can then go on to
02:55 - send additional data so text equals
02:59 - hello for example using an ampersand
03:01 - here there's no need to change that at
03:04 - all
03:04 - it will this line here will handle the
03:07 - type of request so you know so it
03:12 - actually changes the request type then
03:14 - when you go ahead and pick it up in PHP
03:16 - you can go and use dollar underscore
03:20 - post instead
