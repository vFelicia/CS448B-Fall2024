00:00 - what is going on everybody welcome back
00:03 - to your sixth C++ tutorial and I know I
00:07 - have been gone for a while but I have
00:08 - been busy I have been on vacation and I
00:11 - have been working on my website which is
00:14 - finally up for all of you guys who have
00:16 - been telling me to make a website get
00:18 - all my videos organized and uh so
00:21 - anyways I've been listening to you guys
00:23 - I did it all of my videos are organized
00:25 - on my website the new boston.com I'll
00:27 - tell you about it later but for now we
00:29 - have to make some C Plus+ tutorials so
00:31 - if you've been watching my last
00:33 - tutorials you notice that a couple
00:35 - things are different first of all we
00:36 - have a new
00:37 - compiler I read the comments in my old
00:40 - videos about me using an old compiler
00:43 - and that it wasn't up to date and that's
00:46 - just because that old compiler is the
00:48 - one I grew up learning so I was familiar
00:51 - with it I love that compiler but since
00:54 - you guys want to up toate compiler I
00:55 - downloaded code blocks so I think that's
00:58 - the name of the compiler I'm using now
00:59 - supposed to supposed to be up toate you
01:01 - know a better C++ compiler another thing
01:04 - is I'm now using cin CN get instead of
01:09 - system pause and this pretty much does
01:11 - the same thing it waits for user input
01:13 - so your program just doesn't run it
01:15 - pauses it and allows you to look at it
01:18 - so the reason I was using system pause
01:20 - is whenever I first started teaching you
01:22 - guys about C++ none of this stuff made
01:26 - sense to you and system pause was the
01:28 - only thing you could look at and
01:29 - understand and it said this paused my
01:31 - system so instead of throwing everything
01:34 - at you at once I wanted to take
01:36 - everything in baby steps and that's why
01:40 - if you guys say all right why are you
01:42 - doing this instead of a better way of
01:44 - doing this it's because I just want to
01:46 - take everything in baby steps one step
01:48 - at a time so anyways that's my excuses
01:50 - for doing that but everything is fixed
01:53 - now so with that being said in the last
01:55 - tutorial we covered the basics of
01:58 - functions and how to use the functions
02:01 - that are built in to C++ already and we
02:04 - pretty much covered one type of function
02:06 - and this was a function that took one
02:08 - parameter or needed one piece of
02:10 - information in order to work but not all
02:14 - functions are like that some functions
02:16 - need more than one piece of information
02:18 - in order to work and some functions need
02:20 - no information at all you're saying all
02:23 - right how the heck does that work I'll
02:24 - show you in a second for example let's
02:26 - go ahead and get a variable name X or
02:30 - one guy left the comment double rainbow
02:34 - huh yeah I stole that joke from someone
02:35 - else on my other videos so I can't take
02:37 - credit for this but anyways we have this
02:40 - variable named Rainbow and we want to
02:42 - use the power of function so let's go
02:46 - ahead and set rainbow equal to p w and
02:50 - set it equal well let me guys let me
02:53 - tell you guys first what the power of
02:54 - function is whenever you do like 5 to
02:58 - the 3 power
03:00 - um I can't it's like five with a little
03:02 - three on the top right this means 5 * 5
03:06 - * 5 5 times itself three times so what
03:10 - is 5 * 5 * 5 well 5 * 5 that's 2 is 25 *
03:16 - the 3 one is 125 so saying all right so
03:20 - in order for us to use this function it
03:23 - obviously needs two numbers AKA two
03:27 - pieces of information the first one is
03:29 - the base and the second one is the
03:31 - exponent so how do we pass in two
03:34 - different numbers using the parameters
03:37 - well the first thing we do is type in
03:39 - any old number and this like we saw in
03:42 - the last tutorial this is how you pass
03:43 - in one piece of information but when you
03:45 - have more than one piece of information
03:47 - you need to pass in a function what you
03:49 - need to do is separate it with a comma
03:52 - and then add another number it doesn't
03:54 - matter if there's a space in there or
03:55 - not so might as well tighten that up so
03:57 - anyways if you have a function that
03:59 - takes two integers in this instance just
04:03 - go ahead and throw in your first one
04:04 - like normal and then add a comma and
04:06 - throw in your second one after that so
04:08 - anyways what I'm trying to say is
04:10 - anytime you need more than one piece of
04:13 - information for your function you need
04:15 - to separate them with commas and just to
04:17 - prove to you guys that this works let's
04:19 - go ahead and see out
04:23 - um
04:25 - rainbow and just go ahead and end that
04:27 - line and Yep looks pretty good so let's
04:30 - go ahead and build and run this and see
04:32 - what we get 125 and that's cuz 5 * 5 * 5
04:37 - is5 so that's how the power function
04:40 - works or you know using exponents so
04:43 - let's go ahead and delete this actually
04:45 - let's just go ahead and delete this and
04:47 - remember at the beginning the tutorial I
04:49 - was telling you guys some functions
04:51 - don't need any information at all and
04:53 - you guys are scratching your head be
04:55 - like what's the use of a function if
04:56 - doesn't need any information well I'll
04:58 - show you guys right here let's go ahead
05:00 - and make another function or another
05:02 - variable right now called Y and set this
05:05 - equal to y equals Rand and just put
05:09 - empty parentheses this function is not
05:12 - going to take any parameters and by the
05:13 - way Rand comes from C standard Library
05:18 - it's a c function so make sure you have
05:20 - this include or else it won't work so
05:22 - we're saying all right what is Rand and
05:25 - why the heck does it not need any
05:28 - parameters at all Rand is the function
05:30 - to generate a random number it's going
05:33 - to generate it in the scope of well we
05:36 - won't cover that now but just listen to
05:39 - this it's going to generate a random
05:42 - number so why would you pass it in a
05:44 - piece of information like five or 81 it
05:47 - doesn't need that information that would
05:48 - just be you generating your own random
05:51 - number that pops into your head we want
05:52 - the computer to generate it for us so
05:55 - therefore we don't give any information
05:57 - at all the computer is going to take
05:59 - care of of everything for us so let's go
06:01 - ahead and uh run this and go ahead leave
06:03 - a comment see what number you think this
06:05 - is go ahead don't cheat don't cheat all
06:09 - right now go ahead and run it and see if
06:10 - you're right 41 so if any of you mofos
06:14 - guess 41 congratulations you are the
06:18 - winner and uh give me a call I think I'm
06:20 - going to have you pick my Power Ball
06:21 - tickets next time so
06:23 - anyways random or excuse me
06:27 - functions sometimes take one person
06:29 - parameter they sometimes take multiple
06:32 - parameters in that case you separate
06:33 - them with commas and sometimes they
06:36 - don't take any parameter at all they
06:38 - just pretty much do something and don't
06:40 - need any information from the user or
06:43 - from the programmer or for anyone they
06:44 - just do it it's done with forget about
06:47 - it so anyways now that we have all of
06:51 - the functions covered and we understand
06:53 - how buil-in functions work in the next
06:55 - tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
06:57 - guys how to build your own custom
07:00 - functions so it's going to be awesome we
07:02 - are done with built-in functions for now
07:06 - um it's definitely a lot cooler and more
07:09 - useful building our own custom functions
07:12 - because then instead of you know using
07:14 - random numbers and Powers we can make
07:15 - these new functions do whatever the heck
07:17 - we want them to so I'm super excited but
07:20 - for now I'm going to go uh check eBay
07:22 - because I'm selling something on there
07:24 - and I want to you know see if I got any
07:27 - questions or anything thing but um
07:29 - all right I lied I'm just going to pound
07:31 - a few beers and then probably make
07:32 - another tutorial but thank you guys for
07:34 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
07:35 - I'll see you guys next time
