00:00 - what's going on everybody how you doing
00:03 - and welcome back to your fifth C++
00:05 - tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - be going over something called functions
00:10 - now there are two really main types of
00:14 - functions the first type is functions
00:18 - that we write we create ourself and
00:21 - we're going to be talking about those
00:23 - you know in a couple tutorials from now
00:25 - but in this tutorial what I want to talk
00:27 - about is functions that are already buil
00:30 - in to C++ that we can use so with that
00:34 - being said let's go ahead and uh you
00:35 - know start writing some code go ahead
00:38 - and make a variable double A and I know
00:41 - that you guys are used to int but I'm
00:43 - going to switch to double double is
00:47 - pretty much real numbers um they allow
00:50 - you unlike integers we are now allowed
00:53 - to use decimal points like
00:55 - 87.2 and you know it doesn't have to be
00:58 - just whole
01:00 - integers like int we can now use you
01:03 - know uh decimal points that's the main
01:05 - thing you got to worry about so anyways
01:07 - start using double instead of V because
01:10 - you'll see later on so now that we have
01:13 - a blank variable called a let's go ahead
01:16 - and take that and set it equal to this
01:19 - sqrt and write two parentheses and in
01:23 - those parentheses write any number you
01:25 - want like
01:27 - 154 pretty cool huh so we're saying all
01:29 - right all right what the heck is this
01:31 - squirt 154 WTF mofo no what this is is
01:36 - the square root function this is already
01:40 - built into C++ and what it does is it
01:43 - takes the number
01:44 - 154 gets the square root of it and
01:47 - stores it in the value of a excuse me in
01:51 - the variable a so now we can just go
01:53 - ahead and output that on the screen and
01:56 - it should print out whatever that value
01:59 - is this square root of 154 which should
02:01 - be like 12 point something so let's go
02:05 - ahead and do this and we're going to get
02:08 - an error and I'll tell you why we get an
02:10 - error right here and I know you guys
02:12 - can't see the error method or excuse me
02:14 - the error uh message but it says square
02:16 - root Undeclared first useing this
02:18 - function this is because whenever our
02:22 - program came across this sqrt it didn't
02:25 - know what the heck we were trying to do
02:27 - was it like are you trying to set a
02:29 - equal to the letters sqrt and then a
02:32 - parentheses and what the heck are you
02:33 - trying to do here that's because we need
02:36 - to include something called a function
02:38 - header now the header file let C++ know
02:42 - what sqrt is and lets it know that it's
02:46 - actual an actual function and we're not
02:48 - trying to set it equal to you know just
02:50 - some random letters and in order to do
02:52 - that we need to do this
02:54 - include
02:56 - cmath and once we include cmath this
02:59 - this gives us access to all the
03:01 - mathematical functions we can use so now
03:04 - that this is included in our program
03:06 - whenever we come across this line of
03:08 - code right here it knows that it's not
03:10 - just four random letters and some
03:12 - parentheses it knows that this is a
03:15 - mathematical function and it's to be
03:17 - treated as such so now if we go ahead
03:20 - and run this we're going to get an
03:22 - actual program
03:25 - 124097 H have to remember that so what
03:28 - it did is did this it took 154 found the
03:32 - square root of it and stored it in the
03:34 - variable a and then we just printed out
03:36 - a now for your
03:39 - terminology whenever you use a function
03:42 - it's called calling a function so
03:45 - whenever I'm talking I say all right
03:47 - let's go ahead and call this you know I
03:49 - don't mean like on my cell phone or
03:50 - anything I mean let's go ahead and use
03:52 - this I'll probably use them
03:53 - interchangeably so you know just bear
03:55 - with me here but that's the technical
03:57 - term so if you're ever you know
03:58 - interviewing for job say Calla function
04:02 - whenever you take that value whatever
04:05 - value you get back in this case
04:08 - 124097 h I remembered it I think it's
04:12 - called its return value so 154 is the
04:17 - number you want to figure out what the
04:18 - square root of but
04:20 - 12.4 that's the return value that's the
04:23 - value we stored in a so again calling a
04:26 - function return value the last couple
04:29 - things we need to go over is this number
04:31 - you put inside the
04:33 - parentheses this is called the parameter
04:36 - now a parameter is any information that
04:39 - the function needs in order to work so
04:42 - you know it needs a number to be square
04:44 - rooted so we pass it in
04:46 - 154 and throwing a number in there is
04:49 - called passing in a number and again
04:52 - that it's called the parameter or
04:55 - passing in a value you know once I use
04:58 - it in context you guys we'll see you
05:00 - later on they're kind of like the same
05:01 - thing
05:02 - so now that we got all the terminology
05:05 - down uh let's go ahead and let's go
05:08 - ahead and make another program actually
05:10 - so you need to include this anytime you
05:13 - use the square root function and that's
05:15 - not only square root function you get
05:17 - another set of functions you know built
05:20 - in with this by the way I don't know if
05:21 - I said this already but this include IO
05:23 - stream this allows us to use the you
05:26 - know C in C out uh functions method I
05:30 - mean not methods that's from another
05:32 - computer language that I've been uh
05:34 - using but anyways enough for me R
05:36 - rambling let's go ahead and create
05:38 - another program so let's go ahead and
05:42 - make another double number and also
05:46 - double answer and let's go ahead and
05:48 - allow the user to enter a number and
05:51 - then we will calculate the square root
05:54 - of that and then print it out for him so
05:56 - how do we make the user enter
05:58 - information
06:00 - CN and then whatever number they enter
06:02 - is going to be stored in the variable
06:05 - number and now let's go ahead and take
06:08 - that number find the square root of it
06:10 - and store it in the variable answer so
06:12 - answer equals
06:15 - sqrt of
06:18 - number so whatever number they entered
06:21 - we're going to get the square root of it
06:24 - and that's the return value the answer
06:27 - and we're going to store that return
06:28 - value in our variable answer so now all
06:32 - I have to do is print out answer see out
06:35 - answer and let just go ahead and end
06:37 - that line so now this should work as
06:40 - long as I didn't spell anything wrong so
06:42 - let's go ahead and enter you know 54
06:46 - press enter the square root of that is
06:48 - 7.34
06:50 - 847 handy bit of information you might
06:53 - want to hold on to
06:54 - that so that was a uh breathtaking
06:58 - tutorial I hope hope you guys enjoyed
07:00 - that so that's pretty much the basics of
07:02 - everything we learned so far varibles C
07:05 - in C out and also pre-built functions so
07:09 - again what function is is pretty much a
07:12 - built-in I don't know you guys can see
07:14 - for yourself it performs an equation or
07:16 - it does something else for you
07:17 - automatically saves you a lot of trouble
07:20 - so these are ways you can use built-in
07:22 - functions in
07:24 - C++ and in the upcoming tutorials like I
07:27 - said there are also ways we can create
07:29 - our very own functions which is uh a lot
07:32 - more fun actually so uh that's what you
07:34 - guys have to look forward to in the next
07:36 - couple tutos and also hearing my
07:38 - beautiful voice so don't forget you have
07:40 - to have that to look forward to and you
07:43 - know what else you have to look forward
07:44 - to all this source code for you guys for
07:47 - free on my for click the link below sign
07:50 - up leave me a couple messages tell me
07:52 - how awesome I am and go ahead and get it
07:54 - for free so anyways thank you guys for
07:56 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
07:58 - I'll see you guys later
