00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 47th udk tutorial and this is going to
00:04 - be a really quick tutorial because
00:06 - before we go on any further with kismet
00:09 - I need to talk to you guys about adding
00:11 - comments to kismet because later on
00:15 - we're going to be building big kismet
00:17 - sequences and things are going to get
00:19 - all jumbled together and we're going to
00:21 - be connecting wires all over the place
00:23 - and at first glance things can get kind
00:26 - of confusing so I'm going to teach you
00:28 - guys how to add these things called
00:29 - comments and helps organize and visually
00:32 - see your kismet a whole lot easier so
00:35 - the first thing I want to teach you guys
00:37 - is about object comments now each of
00:39 - these things like this event the sound
00:41 - this toggle this variable each one of
00:45 - these things is an object and you can
00:46 - add a comment individually to each one
00:48 - of these so for example if we have a
00:51 - million different light switches in our
00:54 - you know level or on our sequence we
00:56 - need to be able to identify each one in
00:59 - look at this trigger 0 trigger one
01:02 - trigger to that can get a little bit
01:04 - confusing whenever you have a huge map
01:06 - so go ahead and in order to add a
01:08 - comment right above this you just go
01:11 - ahead and select it in under sequence
01:13 - object you have the optional comments so
01:16 - I'm just going to go ahead and add you
01:18 - would add something like oops easy caps
01:22 - locks bathroom light
01:26 - switch or something like that now just
01:28 - go ahead and focus away and now you can
01:31 - see you have a comment above it this has
01:32 - bathroom light switch so you know if you
01:35 - think about it this way in your house
01:37 - you have a bunch of different light
01:39 - switches and if you just go ahead and
01:41 - identify my trigger zero trigger 1002
01:44 - then it will get kind of confusing but
01:47 - if your mom says go ahead and turn off
01:48 - the bathroom light switch then you be
01:50 - able to identify a lot easier so I don't
01:52 - need to tell you guys the importance of
01:54 - comments in that sense so let me go
01:56 - ahead and just comment some of the rest
01:58 - of these object comment on the sound is
02:02 - just what sounded we have um I think we
02:07 - it was like a gun sound so that looks
02:11 - good right there and for this toggle
02:13 - we'll just go ahead and write turn
02:16 - lights on and off that's pretty good and
02:22 - for this variable we'll just put like
02:25 - light bulb so now even if you don't know
02:31 - kismet at all you can pretty easily see
02:34 - what's going on alright here's a
02:35 - bathroom light switch and now whenever
02:38 - you touch it a gun sound place and also
02:40 - when you touch it it turns lights on and
02:43 - off and this is your light bulb right
02:44 - there so again if you were working as a
02:47 - team then comments would come in handy
02:49 - so much because they don't have to go
02:51 - through each one of these vents look at
02:53 - the properties and say alright what's
02:54 - this one do try to figure out everything
02:56 - so aside from just object comments you
02:59 - also can have something called group
03:02 - comments so in order to select group
03:05 - remember you go ahead and you hold ctrl
03:07 - + alt on your keyboard and then you
03:10 - select a group of objects so now I have
03:13 - all four of these objects selected now
03:16 - we can go ahead and either right click
03:18 - and add new comment and there's another
03:21 - way but I'm just going to go ahead and
03:23 - show you guys the easiest way so with
03:25 - all of those selected go ahead and hit
03:26 - right click new comment and will just
03:29 - write something like um
03:33 - lighting system and now go ahead and hit
03:37 - okay and it draws a box around all of
03:41 - these objects and calls it lighting
03:44 - system so now you don't even have to
03:46 - look at all of these piece by piece you
03:48 - can just send this to somebody and they
03:50 - know all right all of these objects make
03:52 - up the lighting system so this is a
03:55 - whole lot easier to see then you know
03:57 - just opening a kismet for the very first
04:00 - time say someone handed off the project
04:02 - to you and try and figure out what
04:04 - everything does so again comments are
04:07 - going to come in handy so much not only
04:09 - when you're working with a team but when
04:11 - you're working with yourself and you
04:13 - have huge levels it's going to help you
04:16 - organize a whole lot so again one last
04:18 - time to select the group objects just go
04:21 - ahead and hit ctrl + alt and drag and
04:24 - then you get a group of objects selected
04:26 - so aside from this I just want to go
04:28 - over this real quick this sequence frame
04:31 - right here the size is of course the
04:34 - size of the frame the border with I
04:36 - usually like to bump this up to two or
04:38 - three and for the sake of this sorel let
04:40 - me just make it five or something and
04:42 - this makes your border a little bit
04:43 - thicker because I don't really like one
04:46 - because one is the size of these wires
04:48 - so I know I just like a little bit
04:50 - different personal preference and the
04:53 - other two things I like or well of the
04:55 - fill color I don't even get in that the
04:58 - border color is I usually like to change
05:01 - this to something a little bit different
05:02 - so by default it's black like that so
05:06 - let me go ahead and change it to like a
05:09 - blue or something hit OK and now it's
05:12 - blue so whenever you have a bunch of
05:15 - different systems rigged up trust me and
05:17 - I know I can't really demonstrate this
05:19 - because i only have one system but
05:20 - changing your border color two different
05:23 - colors is incredibly useful especially
05:25 - when you zoom out you can easily see
05:28 - well just trust me change your border
05:31 - colors to different colors it's going to
05:33 - help you out a lot so anyways that's a
05:35 - tutorial on comments like I said a real
05:37 - quick tutorial to help you guys better
05:39 - organized and better visually see what's
05:41 - going on with kismet so you don't have
05:43 - to figure everything out
05:44 - every time you want to go back and
05:45 - change something so thank you guys for
