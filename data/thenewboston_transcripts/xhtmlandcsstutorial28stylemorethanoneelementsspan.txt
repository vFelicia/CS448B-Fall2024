00:00 - what is going on everybody welcome back
00:02 - to your 28th CSS tutorial and this is
00:05 - gonna be an amazing story because in
00:07 - this lesson I'm gonna be teaching guys
00:09 - how to apply styles to more than one
00:12 - element at a time because before we had
00:15 - to take each element and apply one style
00:18 - at a time and it took a lot of time and
00:20 - I'm just way too lazy for that so I'm
00:22 - gonna teach you guys how to save some
00:24 - time and also we're gonna be learning
00:25 - something else if I don't run out of
00:27 - time in this video so the first thing we
00:29 - need is just go ahead and add some
00:31 - normal text on your web page not up
00:33 - there down here in your body this is
00:36 - normal text and under this just go ahead
00:39 - and make a header one you can actually
00:42 - make whatever header you want but I
00:43 - chose header one why not and go ahead
00:46 - and row it right like this is header one
00:50 - in it and under your header go ahead and
00:53 - make a paragraph there's my opening P
00:55 - and in your paragraph text just right
00:58 - this is a paragraph or anything you want
01:02 - so anyways like I said what I want to
01:05 - teach you guys had to do is apply styles
01:07 - to more than one element at a time so
01:09 - before what we did is we had a tag for
01:12 - example our header tag which we would
01:14 - put h1 and then we would go ahead in
01:17 - there curly braces apply whatever style
01:19 - property value we wanted to and then
01:22 - under that we would have another thing
01:24 - like P for paragraph and then in here we
01:27 - would apply whatever same style we want
01:29 - but what if you had this crazy idea that
01:31 - I want to apply the same style to two
01:35 - different tags for example I want to
01:37 - turn all the text and my paragraph read
01:40 - and also all the text in my header read
01:42 - so if we wanted to apply the same style
01:45 - to more than one element at a time
01:47 - here's a nice little shortcut for that
01:49 - instead of writing on several different
01:52 - lines we can go ahead and write h1 just
01:55 - like before and we can write a comma and
01:57 - then after that go ahead and add your
02:00 - other element on the same exact line so
02:03 - this saves you the trouble of not only
02:05 - having to add many elements but on one
02:09 - line right all the elements you want you
02:12 - just have to remember to set
02:13 - rate them with a comma and then you only
02:15 - apply that rule once and when you apply
02:18 - it once it's gonna affect all the
02:20 - elements you told it to so like I said
02:22 - it saves you some time so let's go ahead
02:24 - and check out an example right now if we
02:26 - go ahead and take the property color set
02:28 - equal to red or something simple
02:29 - something that shows up good and go
02:32 - ahead and save that now check it out the
02:34 - normal text stayed the same right there
02:37 - because it didn't get affected with our
02:39 - CSS but the header and paragraph both
02:42 - turned red even though they're on the
02:44 - same line and we only said that CSS rule
02:47 - color read one time it applied it to
02:50 - both the paragraph and header one
02:52 - element so again like you can see this
02:55 - saves you a whole lot of time whenever
02:56 - you're applying the same style to many
02:59 - different elements and I did it with two
03:01 - elements in this example but you can do
03:03 - with three four or five however many you
03:05 - want so anyways that's what I wanted to
03:08 - show you for the first half of this
03:09 - story now let's just go ahead and delete
03:11 - everything because that was simple
03:13 - enough what I want to show you guys now
03:16 - is something called span now before I
03:21 - taught you guys how to apply styles to
03:23 - entire elements for example and that's
03:25 - in the lesson I just showed you how
03:28 - would you apply the style to an entire
03:30 - header or how would you apply a style to
03:33 - an entire paragraph but say for example
03:35 - you have a paragraph let me go ahead and
03:37 - make one real quick on your screen like
03:40 - this and there's a bunch of text in it
03:42 - let me let me just type some stuff this
03:44 - is my first para and I love carrots and
03:49 - apple pie so you have this wonderful
03:51 - paragraph on your screen and this
03:53 - website is looking pretty good so far
03:54 - but you get this crazy idea that maybe
03:57 - you want to apply a CSS property to you
04:01 - know maybe just a couple words well we
04:04 - know that we can't apply it to the
04:06 - paragraph or it's going to affect
04:07 - everything so how do we solve that
04:09 - problem
04:10 - well what XHTML did or the wonderful
04:13 - people who made it they invented a
04:15 - special XHTML tag and it's called span
04:19 - EAN and whenever we want to effect just
04:23 - a group or a block of text what we need
04:25 - to do is we need to surround that text
04:28 - with our span tags so let me go ahead
04:30 - and surround like um I love carrots with
04:33 - a special span tags now this is a double
04:36 - tag so it has an opening and closing
04:38 - span and let me go ahead and end it
04:41 - right here span in our scene all right
04:45 - bucky so how do i actually apply a CSS
04:48 - rule to this well again just like any
04:51 - other element just go ahead and type the
04:53 - element name which is span up here and
04:55 - I'm not just making this word up you
04:57 - can't like write your name and put it in
04:59 - here and expect it to work
05:00 - span is actually a built-in thing so you
05:04 - know don't go making up words on me
05:06 - so anyways in your curly brackets just
05:09 - write it like you write any other normal
05:12 - CSS property so let's go ahead and
05:15 - something different than color let's go
05:17 - ahead and change the font weight this
05:18 - time let's change this to bold and also
05:22 - might as well change the color to color
05:24 - change it to green I should look pretty
05:27 - good so now let's go ahead and save this
05:29 - and refresh and check it out none of the
05:33 - paragraph is affected but your span
05:35 - which is pretty much like custom made
05:37 - tags this might be easier way to
05:39 - understand it that is only part that's
05:42 - affected so if you ever come across this
05:44 - problem where you want to apply a CSS
05:46 - rule but you don't want to affect the
05:49 - whole tag you can insert these custom
05:51 - span tags and then only the text that's
05:54 - in between those tags is going to be
05:56 - affected so that's pretty sweet and
05:58 - again like I said span is a keyword that
06:01 - you need to use you just can't use any
06:03 - word you want like your name or your
06:05 - favorite food you need to work use the
06:07 - word span or else your browser's not
06:09 - going to understand it so anyways that's
06:12 - all I have for you guys for this
06:14 - tutorial so um thank you for watching
06:16 - and don't forget to check out my next
