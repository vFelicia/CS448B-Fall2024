00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your seventh physics tutorial
00:04 - and in this tutorial I'm going to be
00:05 - showing you guys how to calculate
00:07 - something called absolute error and
00:09 - percentage error it's basically the
00:11 - formula you use whenever you want to
00:14 - figure out how much did you mess up by
00:17 - it's actually one of the very first
00:18 - formulas that your teacher teaches you
00:20 - in either college or High School physics
00:23 - so say for example that you were doing
00:26 - your very first college lab and your
00:28 - teacher wanted you to find the weight of
00:30 - a cheeseburger or something so what they
00:33 - did is they gave you this cheeseburger
00:35 - however maybe your equipment wasn't
00:38 - right on point or maybe you smoked a
00:40 - little pot before class so you weren't
00:41 - really on top of your game so we needed
00:45 - to you know find out the answer that we
00:48 - got was probably a little bit different
00:50 - than the answer that it should have been
00:53 - so in order to calculate how much we
00:55 - messed up by we can use these formulas
00:57 - called error functions or error formulas
00:59 - for so before we go ahead and get to the
01:02 - formulas I need to talk to you guys
01:04 - about some variables now whenever we're
01:07 - working with these formulas
01:10 - d da is going to stand
01:16 - for
01:18 - Absolute Air now for example this
01:21 - basically means in everyday terms how
01:23 - much did you mess up by say for example
01:27 - we have a cow that weighed three 300 lb
01:31 - however whenever you measured it you
01:34 - found that it weighed 290 lb and that
01:37 - may be because you know you weren't
01:39 - paying attention really to the scale or
01:41 - maybe the scale you waited on is from
01:43 - you know
01:45 - 1,620 the year 1620 so you know it's not
01:48 - the most reliable scale so anyways you
01:51 - messed up by 10 PBS so 10 would be your
01:55 - absolute error so that's your quick
01:57 - little uh you know explanation of that
01:59 - basically means how much did you mess up
02:01 - by now the other variables we need is
02:05 - XM and XM is not the radio it
02:10 - means
02:12 - measured value or basically the value
02:14 - that you came up with so in this case it
02:17 - would be 290 since that's the value that
02:20 - you came up with I have really pretty
02:22 - handwriting I just noticed that and the
02:25 - last variable is X
02:28 - a if I can write that correctly I'll get
02:30 - it eventually give me some time XA
02:34 - equals
02:36 - actual value and this pretty much means
02:38 - the correct value or the value that it
02:41 - should be so the correct weight of the
02:43 - cow was 300 so let me go ahead and just
02:46 - give you guys another real quick example
02:48 - so say we want to C calculate the
02:51 - Absolute Air let me think of something
02:54 - we'll go ahead and do the cheeseburger
02:56 - example so say our teacher gave us a
02:59 - cheeseburger and we needed to find the
03:01 - mass of that cheeseburger well whenever
03:04 - we calculated the mass of that
03:06 - cheeseburger we found that it had a mass
03:08 - of
03:10 - 5.8 kilg however when our teacher did it
03:15 - she got a value of
03:17 - 5.6 so she knows what she's doing so 5.6
03:21 - kilograms is the actual value so what we
03:24 - need to do is we need to take 5.8 and
03:27 - subtract 5.6 and we get. 2
03:32 - kilog for da in other words our absolute
03:36 - error is 02 kilograms that's how much we
03:39 - messed up by pretty simple stuff huh so
03:42 - now let me go ahead and add a new layer
03:45 - and show you guys how to calculate
03:47 - percentage error now the variable is a
03:51 - little bit different it's actually just
03:52 - written a little bit different it's D
03:55 - percentage and this stands
03:57 - for percentage
04:00 - air I probably have the best handwriting
04:03 - in the world so d% equals percentage air
04:07 - and this basically means instead of
04:09 - coming up with a value like 0.2 or you
04:13 - know 10 pounds whatever we come up with
04:15 - a percent so it's like we messed up by
04:18 - 10% or 3% or something like that so let
04:21 - me go ahead and change my color let me
04:22 - change it to something like bright red
04:25 - so say we had well let me give you guys
04:28 - the formula for error so the formula for
04:32 - percentage error equals
04:35 - 100 time our measured value XM minus the
04:41 - actual value over the actual value so
04:45 - this looks really complicated but it's
04:47 - actually really easy so let me go ahead
04:50 - and I guess we'll do that uh
04:52 - cheeseburger example let's see if I can
04:54 - remember the values so we came up with
04:57 - what was it 5.8 kg I'll leave the
05:00 - kilograms out and the actual value was
05:04 - 5.6 so what we do is we take 5.8 minus
05:08 - 5.6 and we get
05:11 - 0.2 and we need to divide that by the
05:13 - actual value now the actual value was
05:17 - 5.6 so. 2 / 5.6
05:23 - equals
05:28 - 0357 so so what we need to do now is we
05:31 - need to take this number and times it by
05:35 - 100 so all we need to do in order to
05:38 - times it by 100 move the decimal points
05:40 - two places to the right so
05:46 - 3.57 is our percentage
05:48 - error pretty cool huh so basically again
05:51 - one last time is we take the measured
05:54 - value which is
05:56 - 5.8 and subtract the actual value which
05:59 - is 5.6 and we get this number right here
06:02 - in this case it was 0.2 and we take that
06:05 - and divided by the actual value which
06:08 - was 5.6 again this number and this
06:11 - number are the same and then all we need
06:13 - to do is once we have our value times it
06:15 - by 100 and Bam there we go our
06:18 - percentage error perfect and hopefully
06:22 - this number is as small as possible if
06:24 - this number is small it means you did a
06:26 - really good job if this number is Big it
06:28 - means that you know you might want to
06:31 - lay off the uh weed before class just a
06:34 - little bit so there you go that's how
06:35 - you calculate errors and uh yeah like I
06:38 - said hopefully we won't be using this
06:39 - formula too much but whenever we need it
06:42 - there it is so thank you guys for
06:43 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
06:44 - I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
