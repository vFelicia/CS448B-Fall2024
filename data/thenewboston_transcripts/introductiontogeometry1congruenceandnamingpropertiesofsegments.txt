00:01 - okay today we're going to be talking
00:03 - about congruent segments and they're
00:06 - just segments that have equal
00:08 - measurements um since the only way we
00:11 - measure a line is to measure its length
00:14 - we're going to say that they are
00:15 - segments that have equal length so down
00:19 - here I have two segments drawn already
00:22 - and if you were to measure them you
00:24 - would find that the distance from A to B
00:30 - is
00:31 - five
00:33 - cm so we write that as a b and since
00:38 - it's a line segment we put a little bar
00:40 - on top of it is equal to 5 cm don't
00:46 - forget your units those are always
00:48 - really important in
00:50 - Geometry okay we're going to measure C
00:53 - to D and you would find that the
00:56 - length is also 5 cm
01:00 - so I write that c
01:03 - d is equal to 5
01:08 - cm and since they have equal
01:12 - length we can
01:15 - say that line segment
01:18 - AB is equal to line segment
01:23 - CD or that
01:27 - A and C D
01:34 - are
01:38 - congruent
01:40 - line
01:47 - segments okay all right let's say you're
01:51 - given this
01:53 - information and they want you to find
01:56 - the length of a line segment a d given
01:59 - that ax is equal to 4 cm and XD is equal
02:04 - to 8 cm so we're just going to label
02:07 - this right
02:10 - here
02:18 - four and
02:21 - eight and since
02:25 - this is what we're trying to
02:28 - find we can
02:31 - add a
02:34 - X Plus x d to find out what a d
02:42 - equals and
02:45 - this this is called the addition
02:47 - property of segments and it allows us to
02:50 - take one part of a segment right here
02:55 - and add it to the other part of the
02:57 - segment to find the whole
03:00 - measurement of the whole segment so all
03:02 - we do is we since we know ax is 4
03:09 - cm plus XD which is 8
03:13 - cm we just add those together and you
03:16 - get 12
03:18 - CM
03:20 - therefore a d the length of a d is equal
03:24 - to 12
03:27 - CM now the only reason we can do this is
03:30 - because X lies in between a d if x say x
03:36 - was over here
03:40 - somewhere and this was
03:42 - X and we wanted to find the length of a
03:47 - d we couldn't we couldn't do anything
03:51 - with X it's only because X is between A
03:53 - and D that we can add ax + XD
03:59 - and this makes sense if you think about
04:01 - it because if you had a
04:05 - pizza and you
04:08 - had this much of a
04:12 - pizza say this is 1/4 of a pizza and
04:15 - that's how much was
04:17 - eaten if the rest of
04:20 - it was also
04:25 - eaten 1
04:26 - 14 + 34
04:30 - gives you the whole pizza it's kind of
04:32 - like these are fractions of a line
04:35 - segment so that to get the whole number
04:40 - you add each part together okay so using
04:45 - those
04:47 - two um definitions we just learned we're
04:51 - going to do some
04:54 - examples
04:55 - okay so we already know that the length
04:59 - of a a
05:03 - b is equal to 3 that's already given to
05:07 - us right here so they say if BC is equal
05:12 - to 12 CM how long is
05:15 - AC so since AC is the whole segment
05:20 - we're going to take each part of the
05:22 - segments and add them together to find
05:24 - the whole length so 12
05:28 - cm+ 3 3 cm is equal to 15
05:33 - cm therefore AC = 15
05:41 - cm all right so on this second one this
05:45 - one's a little different they tell
05:48 - us what the whole length is if HJ which
05:54 - is the entire light line segment is
05:57 - equal to 10 cm
06:00 - what is this part equal to so using the
06:03 - same idea we're going to take the
06:07 - whole length minus part of the length to
06:13 - find out what the other part of the
06:16 - segment
06:17 - equals and I J = 5
06:22 - cm okay for our last example we're going
06:25 - to put the two things we learned
06:28 - together so if ab and BC are congruent
06:32 - and ab is equal to 8 C CM what is the
06:38 - length of
06:40 - AC okay since we know that A and B are
06:44 - congruent that means that they have
06:46 - equal length so if AB is equal to 8
06:51 - cm that means that BC also has to be
06:55 - equal to 8 cm so to find the whole
06:58 - length of this we're going to add
07:00 - a and b c together so we get 8 cm Plus 8
07:07 - cm equal 16
07:11 - cm so AC equal
07:14 - 16
07:17 - cm okay now that you understand the
07:21 - basic properties of line segments um be
07:24 - sure to come back and watch the next
07:26 - video which is going to go over the
07:28 - properties of angles El
