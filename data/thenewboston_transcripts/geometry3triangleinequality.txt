00:01 - So today we're going to talk about
00:02 - triangle inequality properties and there
00:05 - are three that we're going to talk about
00:07 - so our first one
00:12 - says if one side of a triangle is longer
00:16 - than another side of a triangle then the
00:20 - angle opposite the first side is greater
00:22 - than the angle opposite the second side
00:26 - so say we know that CB
00:30 - is
00:33 - longer than C
00:37 - A so which we can tell just by looking
00:40 - at it so that means that this angle
00:43 - angle a which is opposite
00:47 - CB angle a is going to be
00:52 - greater than this angle that's opposite
00:57 - CA angle B
01:02 - so our next property
01:08 - says that if one angle of a triangle is
01:12 - longer than larger than the other angle
01:15 - the side opposite the first angle is
01:17 - longer than the side opposite the
01:19 - smaller angle so this is basically like
01:22 - the last one just reversed so if you
01:25 - know that this
01:28 - angle angle a is greater
01:32 - than angle
01:36 - B then the side opposite angle a which
01:41 - is
01:42 - CB is going to be greater than the side
01:45 - opposite B which is c
01:48 - a whereas the other one we knew this and
01:52 - then we could figure out
01:57 - that and last we
02:00 - know lastly we know that the sum of any
02:04 - two sides of a triangle is greater than
02:07 - the length of the third side so that
02:09 - means
02:11 - that the sum
02:14 - of the sum of
02:17 - CB plus C A is greater than
02:21 - AB the sum of
02:24 - ab plus C A is greater than CB
02:30 - the sum of C A
02:36 - Plus and C A or no excuse me
02:42 - CB plus
02:45 - AB is greater than
02:49 - CA so now we're going to do
02:53 - some examples where we use these to
02:57 - solve things so is it possible to have a
03:01 - triangle with sides with the following
03:04 - lengths 209 and 8 so first we're going
03:08 - to add them all up and make sure that
03:12 - like the length of these two is greater
03:14 - than this one for every single pair of
03:17 - angles so 20 + 9 is greater than 8 yes
03:22 - that's
03:23 - true 9 + 8 is greater than 20 oh wait we
03:28 - have a problem right here 9 + 8 is only
03:31 - 177 and 17 is not greater than 20 so
03:38 - no it is not
03:43 - possible okay with lengths 9 12 and 15
03:49 - so 9 + 12 greater than 15 this is 21 21
03:55 - is greater than
03:56 - 15 12 + 15 is greater than 9 well that's
04:03 - 27 and 27 is definitely greater than 9
04:07 - and 9 + 15 is greater than 12 this would
04:12 - be 24 which is greater than 12 so
04:17 - yes it is
04:24 - possible which angle is
04:27 - longest so we know that the sides
04:31 - measure x x + 2 and x + 8 if we were to
04:35 - order these from these sides from least
04:39 - to greatest we would have
04:41 - x x + 2 because this
04:45 - x has the same value for each side so if
04:50 - I just have X that's going to be less
04:53 - than if I have X and two more than
04:58 - x so and then x + 8 because this is
05:03 - saying 8 more than x and this is only 2
05:07 - more than x and since X is greater than
05:11 - two this is our order so this is from
05:15 - least to
05:18 - greatest well our angles opposite these
05:21 - sides are going to be the same way so
05:24 - that means since x + 8 is the greatest
05:28 - side the angle opposite x + 8 is going
05:31 - to be the greatest
05:32 - angle so angle 2 is
05:42 - largest which side is
05:44 - longest okay well we know this is a
05:47 - right angle and a right angle measures
05:50 - 90Â° we need to find the measure of this
05:53 - angle so that's 30 by the way if you
05:56 - couldn't
05:57 - tell 90 + 30 is equal
06:03 - to
06:05 - 120 and so 120 + x is equal to 180
06:10 - because remember the interior angles of
06:12 - a triangle equal sum up to
06:15 - 180 so then if we
06:17 - subtract 120 over we get X is equal to
06:21 - 60 so this is equal to 60 so the side
06:25 - that is opposite the largest angle is
06:28 - going to be longest so since this angle
06:31 - right here is the largest that means
06:34 - side
06:36 - a is the
06:40 - largest
06:43 - so this is all we're going to do for
06:45 - today but make sure you come back and
06:47 - watch the next lesson because we're
06:49 - going to start talking about how to
06:51 - geometrically prove the triangles are
06:55 - congruent
