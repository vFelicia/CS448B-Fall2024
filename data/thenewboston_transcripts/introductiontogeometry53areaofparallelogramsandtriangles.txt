00:00 - okay so now we're going to move on to
00:03 - parallelograms and triangles and these
00:06 - are a little bit harder to do than
00:07 - rectangles and squares but not that much
00:10 - you just have to make sure that you're
00:12 - substituting the right values in so for
00:16 - a parallelogram to find the area where
00:19 - we're going to do base times height in
00:22 - this height if you see right here is
00:25 - called the altitude and it's always
00:28 - perpendicular to the base that's why
00:31 - when we do a square we don't have to
00:34 - find a new altitude because this side is
00:37 - the altitude or a rectangle because this
00:40 - side is the altitude of a rectangle but
00:43 - because the parallelogram doesn't have
00:44 - right angles we have to draw in this new
00:47 - height and then our area is base times
00:51 - height and for a triangle it's pretty
00:55 - similar if you look if I were to draw in
00:58 - this diagonal of this parallelogram I
01:01 - would get a triangle that's why when we
01:04 - find the area of a triangle it's
01:06 - one-half base times height because it's
01:09 - a half the area we would get if we had a
01:11 - parallelogram and in a triangle unless
01:15 - it's a right triangle because a right
01:19 - triangle already has a height because
01:21 - this is perpendicular to that unless
01:24 - it's a right triangle you have to draw
01:26 - in a height in here and then your area
01:30 - is one-half base times height now
01:33 - sometimes you're going to have to draw
01:35 - your height outside the triangle or
01:38 - outside you shouldn't have to do it
01:42 - outside of triangle often but sometimes
01:43 - you have to do it for a parallelogram
01:45 - because this is the only place where
01:48 - it's going to form a right angle but you
01:50 - want to make sure that you use this
01:53 - piece as the base instead of this whole
01:55 - piece and then your height is still
01:58 - going to give you the right area so now
02:02 - we're going to do some examples to find
02:06 - the area of the parallelogram so they've
02:11 - already drawn the height in for us
02:13 - and they told us that the height is
02:15 - seven now the height is always going to
02:19 - be perpendicular to the side that we use
02:23 - as the base so for this particular try
02:26 - or parallelogram this is our base or
02:30 - this one but since in a parallelogram
02:34 - opposite sides are congruent it doesn't
02:36 - matter so our base is eight so the area
02:40 - of this parallelogram is 7 times 8 which
02:45 - is going to give us 56 and there aren't
02:48 - units on this one but say they told us
02:51 - that these were in centimeters our area
02:54 - would be fifty six centimeters squared
02:59 - now we're going to do one more example
03:03 - find the area so they give us our height
03:07 - and our height is equal to eight now if
03:11 - you look when we use our base we need
03:15 - this entire side not just this piece of
03:17 - the base so in order to find out with
03:20 - this but this part of the base equals
03:25 - we're going to have to use our
03:27 - Pythagorean theorem to solve for B so if
03:31 - you look right here inside this bigger
03:35 - triangle a right triangle is formed
03:37 - right here so we're going to use the
03:40 - Pythagorean theorem on this right
03:41 - triangle to find be so a squared plus B
03:48 - squared is equal to the hypotenuse
03:52 - squared eight squared is 64 plus B
03:56 - squared and if you plug that into the
03:59 - calculator you get 17 squared is equal
04:04 - to 89 so b squared is equal we're going
04:10 - to subtract the 64 over and I'll get 225
04:16 - if you take the square root of that and
04:18 - put it into a calculator you get B is
04:21 - equal to a plus or minus 115
04:26 - or not a hundred and fifteen just 15 now
04:35 - if you remember where this is a distance
04:39 - we can't have negative distance so we're
04:42 - just going to take the positive value of
04:44 - B so this is 15 so to get the whole base
04:48 - i'm going to add 6 plus 15 if you do
04:52 - that you'll get 21 so to find the area
04:54 - of this triangle we're going to take
04:56 - half the base which is 21 times the
05:01 - height now it doesn't matter what order
05:04 - you multiply in because multiplication
05:07 - is commutative so I'm just going to do
05:10 - the easier one first one half times 8 is
05:13 - 4 times 21 it's going to give you eighty
05:20 - four so our the area of this triangle is
05:25 - 84 and pretend the said inches inches
05:28 - squared so that's all with
05:35 - parallelograms and triangles make sure
05:37 - you come back and watch the next one
05:38 - where we're going to do areas of a
05:40 - trapezoid
