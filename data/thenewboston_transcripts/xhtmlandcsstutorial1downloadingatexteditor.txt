00:15 - on just a second let me explain xhtml
00:18 - and CSS is the language that you use in
00:21 - order to create sweet websites so I'm
00:23 - going to assume that none of you guys
00:25 - have ever created a website before or
00:27 - maybe you did with a program like Dream
00:29 - Weaver and you wanted to know more in
00:31 - depth how to create a website well in
00:34 - this tutorial series I'm going to take
00:35 - you from Total Noob to Total expert web
00:39 - designer we're going to be covering all
00:40 - the basic concepts and also some pretty
00:43 - advanced stuff so stick with me and by
00:45 - the end of these videos you're going to
00:47 - be an excellent web designer so first
00:50 - let me show you guys an example of what
00:52 - xhtml is go ahead and open up your web
00:54 - browser hopefully you're using Google
00:56 - Chrome cuz it's the best in my opinion
00:58 - and go ahead and write right click
01:00 - anywhere on the page and click view page
01:02 - Source now a new screen opens and it's
01:06 - all this computer mumbo jumbo that we
01:08 - really don't know what it is this is
01:11 - actually mostly xhtml and CSS all these
01:14 - little symbols and all these little
01:17 - class equals whatever all this little
01:19 - crap we can't under what the heck do you
01:22 - guys hear that siren it's like a big
01:24 - fire going on behind me anyways I get
01:27 - easily distracted so anyways by the end
01:30 - of these tutorials you're going to be
01:32 - learning what all of this stuff means
01:34 - right here and you're going to be
01:35 - learning how to take this code and turn
01:37 - it into right here a beautiful
01:40 - website entrepreneurs who create the
01:42 - corporate world H going to have to check
01:44 - that out later like I said I get easily
01:46 - distracted but anyways check it out the
01:49 - first thing that we need in order to
01:51 - create sweet websites is actually a
01:53 - program on our computer called a text
01:55 - editor and with this text editor we can
01:58 - type in some code
02:00 - and we can turn it into something that
02:02 - looks pretty cool to a browser and a
02:04 - browser is pretty much a program like
02:06 - Firefox or Internet Explorer or Google
02:08 - Chrome it's the program that shows
02:10 - websites so anyways like I said the
02:12 - first thing we need is a text editor now
02:16 - you actually don't need to download
02:18 - anything if you have Windows you have a
02:20 - program on your machine called Notepad
02:22 - so go ahead and open this and look at
02:24 - this you can actually create websites
02:27 - and type xhtml code in here but I mean
02:30 - look at this can they make a program
02:33 - that's any more boring seriously black
02:35 - and white and it has like two options
02:37 - what the heck so anyways I'm going to
02:39 - recommend not to use notepad and I'm
02:42 - going to recommend an even better
02:43 - program the best program that you can
02:46 - use in order to type xhtml and CSS is
02:50 - called notepad++
02:52 - now if you're going to do any serious
02:55 - coding or web design I highly recommend
02:58 - getting this program and best of all
03:00 - it's free so go ahead and go to Google
03:03 - and I'll show you how to get it go ahead
03:05 - and type in
03:07 - notepad Plus+ hit enter and click on the
03:10 - first link that pops up this is notepads
03:13 - website now look for a link that says
03:16 - download and well your website may
03:20 - change depending on when you're watching
03:22 - the tutorial but click download the
03:24 - current version and now you see a bunch
03:27 - of different options right here zip
03:28 - package binary
03:30 - the one you want is the installer it's
03:32 - pretty much a nice easy wizard to guide
03:34 - you through the installation so go ahead
03:35 - and click that and now you're going to
03:37 - have a file that downloads on your
03:39 - computer go ahead and save this and it's
03:42 - going to download and it just downloads
03:45 - so if you're using Google Chrome go
03:46 - ahead and double click that and say do
03:49 - you want to allow yes you want to allow
03:51 - it so now let's go ahead and select
03:54 - English unless you're you know foreign
03:56 - or something if so then how the heck are
03:58 - you understanding me right now now but
03:59 - anyways go ahead and click okay and I'm
04:02 - not going to read that because I'm way
04:03 - too lazy press next I agree probably
04:06 - just sound my life away but big deal
04:08 - I'll get over it click next to this all
04:11 - the defaults look good and press install
04:14 - now it's going to go ahead and install
04:16 - in your system right now and then make
04:18 - sure you have run notepad actually don't
04:20 - click that and make sure you hit finish
04:23 - so now you have notepad++ installed on
04:26 - your computer and here's what I'm going
04:28 - to recommend go ahead and make an icon
04:31 - for it right on your desktop cuz you're
04:33 - going to be using it quite a bit in
04:34 - order to make an icon on your desktop
04:36 - and this isn't only with notepad but any
04:39 - program go ahead and click your little
04:41 - Windows button right there and click all
04:44 - programs now you should have a folder
04:46 - called notepad++ if you expand this
04:49 - you're going to have an application in
04:51 - here called notepad++ This is the
04:53 - program that we just downloaded so if
04:56 - you want to turn this into icon on your
04:58 - desktop go ahead and right click it and
05:00 - press send to desktop this is going to
05:02 - go ahead and create an icon or a
05:04 - shortcut right on your desktop so now
