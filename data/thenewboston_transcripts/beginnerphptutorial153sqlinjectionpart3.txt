00:00 - so let's go back to our database so we
00:02 - can monitor what we're doing here and
00:03 - click back on users okay so we're going
00:07 - to start by opening our text editor and
00:09 - we're going to connect to our MySQL
00:11 - server and then connect to our database
00:13 - so I'm not going to be doing this
00:14 - properly because in this video I'm just
00:15 - demonstrating SQL injection so I'm just
00:18 - going to use a standard MySQL connect
00:20 - function it takes three parameters if
00:23 - you haven't already looked to this I do
00:24 - have another video on it so go back and
00:27 - again have a look at this my username is
00:29 - root and my password is just blank and
00:31 - I'm going to say MySQL select DB and
00:36 - this is a underscore database so let's
00:39 - just echo out a confirmation message
00:40 - here just to check the we're connecting
00:43 - successfully so let's refresh there and
00:46 - it to do that okay so we've got an OK
00:50 - message there so we've successfully
00:51 - connected to the database let's start
00:53 - creating our form so we need to take a
00:56 - username and a password with value and
00:59 - we're doing this I'm going to put both
01:01 - fields equal to text values so you can
01:03 - see what we're typing in in our password
01:05 - field so I'm going to say form action
01:07 - and I need to set a property for method
01:10 - as well and the form action is going to
01:14 - be index dot PHP we're going to come
01:15 - back to that and the method is going to
01:17 - be post ok so we want user name and we
01:20 - want to take an input and the type is
01:23 - text the name is a username and that's
01:28 - it so now what we can do is say password
01:30 - we'll bring this down a line even though
01:32 - we're not breaking down the line we'll
01:33 - just bring it down for all right
01:34 - neatness we'll set input type is text
01:37 - name equals password this is the users
01:41 - password and then again we'll just line
01:45 - down and we'll say add a submit button
01:47 - here it's a very basic HTML form that
01:51 - we're creating let's just preview it in
01:53 - our browser and yeah we've got user name
01:56 - and password so we can type something
01:57 - here and we can type something here ok
02:00 - so we can see the password you'd usually
02:03 - set it to the type of password so you
02:06 - can't actually see the password but for
02:08 - now we're going to we're going to set it
02:10 - to text so we see what we're doing so
02:12 - when the for
02:13 - resubmits we need to first of all check
02:15 - if at the posted you slim a post with
02:18 - posted password are set so we use the is
02:21 - set language constructor we say is set
02:24 - post username and oh sorry and so we use
02:29 - our and operator and we say is set
02:34 - dollar underscore post password so if
02:39 - these are both set we can now assign
02:41 - them to our own variable so username is
02:43 - going to equal dollar underscore post
02:47 - username and password is going to equal
02:50 - dollar underscore post password so let's
02:55 - just echo these out so we see we can see
02:58 - that this is this is giving us back our
03:01 - input so I'm going to type a in here and
03:03 - B in here so what we should get back is
03:05 - just a B next to each other okay yes so
03:08 - our variable two successfully being
03:10 - picked up using the post username the
03:12 - post password so you can now get rid of
03:14 - this echo so it's good to test your
03:17 - program as you go along now I'm going to
03:18 - say if not empty username and not empty
03:28 - password
03:31 - eko okay so now let's test this and
03:36 - submit nothing okay nothing happens now
03:39 - let's test submit a and B click Submit
03:41 - okay so we are checking just doing some
03:44 - basic form validation the username and
03:46 - password must exist okay so now what we
03:49 - need to do is we need to structure our
03:52 - query so our query is going to equal and
03:55 - like I said if you've already seen this
03:56 - you'll know exactly what we're doing the
03:58 - query is going to equal select ID from
04:04 - users much like I demonstrated just
04:07 - about five minutes ago so select ID from
04:09 - users where username equals something
04:15 - here and password equals something here
04:19 - so let's just put them in apostrophes so
04:22 - where username equals something and
04:24 - possibly become something this is
04:25 - obvious it's where username equals user
04:27 - name and password equals password so now
04:30 - we can create a new variable called
04:32 - query run and we can run this query so
04:35 - MySQL query and actually process that
04:38 - query through pH sorry through MySQL now
04:44 - this is the dangerous line because what
04:46 - we've done here is we've processed this
04:48 - query and so far we've given absolutely
04:50 - no protection whatsoever to protect
04:53 - against the SQL injection and I'll show
04:55 - you in a minute we're going to look at
04:57 - something inside the PHP dot ini file so
05:00 - the PHP configuration file which which
05:04 - doesn't automatically escape characters
05:07 - such as a single quotation mark so
05:11 - usually when you submit data with a
05:12 - single quotation I can automatically put
05:15 - a forward slash in front of it as a
05:17 - security measure but at the moment I've
05:20 - got it disabled in my PHP ini file so
05:22 - that's the first way we're going to look
05:24 - at protecting against SQL injection so
05:27 - let's first of all just comment out
05:28 - these and let's go ahead and echo out
05:31 - the username
05:33 - and we'll break down the line and we
05:35 - will echo out the password as well and
05:38 - I'm going to show you exactly what I
05:39 - mean
05:39 - now remember earlier we talked about
05:42 - quotation marks inside inside our
05:46 - queries and quotation marks are deadly
05:50 - as far as query goes because what people
05:52 - can do like we like we and looked at
05:54 - earlier is end a specific statement if
05:59 - you like and and create something else
06:01 - so we can add or key words in and we can
06:04 - end different in different lines or n
06:07 - different like we're equals and we can
06:09 - end here and then start something else
06:11 - and then end here again just like I
06:14 - demonstrated earlier
