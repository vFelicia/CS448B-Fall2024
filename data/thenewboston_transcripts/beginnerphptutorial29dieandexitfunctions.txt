00:00 - now this Alex from PHP academy' to org
00:03 - and welcome to another video tutorial
00:04 - for the new Boston now I'm going to be
00:07 - talking about PHP die and exit and these
00:10 - are two really useful functions that you
00:12 - should get used to using in your program
00:13 - so you can cut the script at any point
00:16 - where you may receive a fatal error
00:18 - in which you don't want to execute any
00:20 - more code now let me just show you
00:22 - demonstrate how this works let's say I
00:24 - want to echo out hello and a space and
00:27 - down here I want to echo out a space and
00:30 - world now if we were to run this if we
00:34 - to run this normally refresh our browser
00:37 - you can see it will just produce the
00:39 - result hello world because we've
00:40 - included hello with a space and we've
00:42 - included world now let me just use the
00:45 - die feature in here and what this is
00:49 - going to do is it from this point
00:50 - onwards is going to kill the rest of the
00:53 - page
00:54 - okay so let's have a look at the result
00:57 - in the browser okay so we're just
00:59 - receiving the string hello now why is
01:04 - this useful
01:04 - I mean Barrowman you can also use exit
01:09 - as well and this does exactly the same
01:11 - thing if we refresh we're getting the
01:13 - same result now why would we want to
01:16 - kill our script in the middle of a page
01:20 - I mean first of all dottie using dine
01:23 - exit exactly the same thing bear in mind
01:27 - you can also part of this function you
01:31 - can specify an error in here so you can
01:34 - use some string to output so error page
01:39 - has ended for example and let's just
01:43 - echo again the world part of this page
01:47 - so if we refresh you can see that we've
01:50 - received this message so you can do that
01:52 - if you want and you can do exactly the
01:54 - same thing with exit as well
01:58 - and we go same thing so how do we use
02:01 - this in a real-life example and why is
02:03 - it useful
02:04 - okay so without overcomplicating things
02:08 - I'm going to attempt now to connect to a
02:13 - database now whether you've come across
02:16 - databases yet or not this is an example
02:20 - to show you how died or exit can be used
02:24 - now to connect to a MySQL database we
02:28 - use the MySQL connect function and we
02:31 - supply it with three I mean we've looked
02:33 - at functions anyway so that you should
02:35 - really understand this at this point and
02:38 - anyway so I'm connecting to localhost my
02:43 - username is Alex and I don't I don't
02:46 - specify a password because I'm running
02:47 - on a local server so what do I do if
02:52 - this is wrong now at the moment if i
02:54 - refresh the page
02:55 - nothing oh okay Oh No okay so sorry my
03:03 - username is root so I've already
03:05 - produced myself an error so if i refresh
03:06 - there okay so that's that's connected
03:10 - absolutely fine so we know that that's
03:12 - connected because we've not received an
03:13 - error that might not necessarily be the
03:16 - case but I know that my username is root
03:18 - my password is blank and the and I'm
03:20 - connecting to my local server so what
03:24 - happens if we want to specify our own
03:27 - error if this hasn't connected so for
03:32 - example or die could not connect to
03:39 - database what I've essentially done here
03:43 - is used or so it's a logical operator
03:45 - we've said or you can also say or like
03:48 - this so or die if this is unsuccessful
03:56 - we want to die and produce this error to
03:59 - the page so at the moment nothing's
04:02 - happening so I can echo down here
04:06 - connected and I refresh and a refresh
04:11 - and I received the error the message
04:13 - connected now what if I change this
04:16 - around so I want to connect to in fact
04:21 - let's just change this back to Alex
04:23 - because I know that's not my username
04:24 - now when i refresh you can see that
04:27 - we've killed the page this has produced
04:31 - an error and we've specified our our own
04:34 - error as well now what if we want to get
04:38 - rid of this error and we just want to
04:41 - display this error
04:42 - we've already displayed user-friendly we
04:45 - just pop an apt before just pop an Apps
04:47 - beforehand now when we refresh we
04:50 - basically are just left with could not
04:52 - connect database so this is essentially
04:54 - a user friendly way of connecting to the
04:56 - database or killing the page obviously
04:59 - we're not now outputting connected
05:01 - killing the page and saying could not
05:03 - connect to database so that's
05:05 - essentially what we've done like I said
05:07 - before you can replace that with the
05:09 - double vertical lines and it will do
05:11 - exactly the same job we're just using
05:13 - logical operators there which we've
05:14 - already covered so you've now seen a
05:19 - real-life example of where you can use
05:22 - die obviously this can also be exit so
05:26 - if we refresh the page it is exactly the
05:28 - same thing could not connect to database
05:30 - so that is basically the die and exit
05:34 - functions within PHP and how useful they
05:37 - can actually be
