00:00 - hello youtube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - continue working on our favorites viewer
00:10 - program now full credit for this program
00:13 - goes to the authors of beginning
00:14 - Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 and they are
00:17 - Thea and Willis and Brian Newsome now
00:19 - they created this great program and I'm
00:21 - using it to teach you guys some visual
00:23 - basic concepts and how to program so
00:26 - let's go ahead and run the program and
00:29 - we can see what we've done so far so
00:31 - when we open up my favorites it loads in
00:34 - the favorites by using the favorite to
00:36 - name and the URL and we can select one
00:39 - of these and visit them so if i visit
00:42 - the new boston it's going to open that
00:45 - up in my default web browser so let's go
00:51 - ahead and we'll run this again and you
00:52 - can see that when it opens up at the
00:54 - beginning we have this ugly link label
00:57 - right here that says link level one and
00:59 - then when we click on it the application
01:01 - freezes and crashes so let's go ahead
01:04 - and make it so that when the program
01:07 - lows there will be a link in there that
01:09 - the user can click on so before they
01:14 - scan all the favorites in let's just go
01:17 - ahead and set that link so we can use
01:21 - what we did down here because we wanted
01:24 - to look similar to the rest of the
01:25 - design of the program and we want to
01:27 - keep it consistent so we'll type link
01:30 - URL dot text equals visit and then we'll
01:37 - add the link that we want so we've got
01:42 - this favorite salsa like them items
01:44 - right here so we'll just put our own
01:46 - link in there so we'll do HTTP colon
01:49 - slash slash and let's just do let's say
01:52 - you have a developer website or
01:54 - something and you want to put that in
01:55 - there to come to advertise for it or to
01:57 - let them know who created it so we can
01:59 - do ww youtube.com slash on live gamer or
02:04 - i could put the website for the rocks
02:08 - publishing company because i created the
02:10 - book that has
02:11 - program in it that'd probably be better
02:13 - but for now we'll just leave it at this
02:15 - so once we set it set the text we want
02:18 - to clear the links in there because if
02:19 - they try to click on something it says
02:21 - visit and then has a link it's going to
02:23 - try to open that link with the visit in
02:25 - front of it and it's just going to mess
02:26 - up so we'll type link URL dot links dot
02:33 - clear and now I need to do is we'll use
02:37 - the same thing we do down here so we'll
02:38 - add a link and we'll start index 6 and
02:41 - then we'll just add our link so we'll go
02:46 - to link URL dot links add and let's find
02:54 - the version of this that we want so we
02:57 - want to start the length and the link
02:59 - data so the start is going to be
03:01 - starting at index 6 because we have 0 1
03:05 - 2 3 4 5 and then after this is when it's
03:08 - going to start and we'll do length let's
03:11 - say let's see we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
03:16 - 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
03:22 - 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 so
03:29 - hopefully 32 will be correct and the
03:31 - link data is going to be HTTP colon
03:36 - slash slash ww youtube com / on live
03:42 - gamer now this will probably be better
03:45 - to put this link into a variable and
03:49 - then use the variable length but this
03:51 - should work just fine so hopefully when
03:54 - we run it everything will work the way
03:56 - we want to do and it says visit and then
03:59 - it has our link so we can go ahead and
04:03 - click on that and it's going to open up
04:04 - the website so let's just fix that we
04:08 - need to go ahead and go to more places
04:12 - now you can see it's giving us the link
04:17 - here so let's just go ahead and replace
04:19 - this with on live gamer so we've got 12
04:25 - three four five six seven eight nine ten
04:29 - so we wanted to be start at six and go
04:33 - to let's see the lengthy out the link is
04:37 - going to be 10 and that's going to be
04:39 - our link so when we visit on live gamer
04:43 - it's going to open up the website now
04:45 - you can see here that we're missing the
04:46 - are so let's go ahead close out of this
04:49 - and we'll make this 11 okay so now what
04:53 - we can do is let's go ahead and add a
04:57 - button that refreshes the favorites so
05:02 - let's say you added a new favorite and
05:04 - you don't have to you don't want to have
05:05 - to close out of the program and then
05:07 - reopen it to add that favorite in there
05:09 - so we can set the text of this to
05:11 - refresh and we can set the name to
05:16 - button refresh now this right here is
05:21 - not in the book i'm adding this myself
05:24 - so come back to or let's create an event
05:27 - for this first so whenever they click
05:29 - refresh what do we want to do well we
05:33 - want to use all of this code right here
05:35 - so what we can do is we can cut this
05:38 - code and let's put it into a sub so we
05:45 - can come down here and type private sub
05:49 - load favorites and it's going to load
05:55 - the favorites into the ListView so
06:00 - before that it loads the favorites in to
06:02 - that list view what we need to do is
06:04 - type list favorites dot items dot clear
06:09 - so it will clear it each time it reloads
06:12 - to favorites so whenever it loads we
06:16 - want to type load favorites and then
06:21 - whenever they click refresh we also want
06:24 - to load the favorites so let's go ahead
06:27 - and run this and you can see that
06:30 - everything is working fine it's got our
06:33 - favorites and we can click on them and
06:35 - now let's go to Internet Explorer
06:37 - and we'll just add a new favorite so
06:39 - we'll just use the home page which is
06:40 - msn com and we'll click add to favorites
06:44 - and we'll call it msn and then if we
06:47 - click Add it's successfully added to our
06:49 - favorites now if we minimize out of this
06:51 - and click refresh you can see that msn
06:54 - is added to our list of favorites and
06:56 - that it will add visit msn for us and we
07:00 - don't have to add any extra code because
07:03 - the way we've made this we can add an
07:04 - infinite number will not really an
07:06 - infinite number but a large number of
07:08 - links and favorites and it will still
07:10 - work so we can also delete favorites so
07:16 - we'll go ahead and come to our favorites
07:18 - and let's just delete this so you can't
07:24 - see this on screen right now but there's
07:26 - an option called delete I deleted that
07:28 - favorite and then when I click refresh
07:30 - you can see that msn is gone so go ahead
07:35 - put that code in if you haven't already
07:36 - and then once you've done that if you
07:39 - don't have any questions move on to the
07:40 - next tutorial
