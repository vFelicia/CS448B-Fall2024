00:00 - Desktop and let's do our zombie so here
00:09 - we have our cartoon zombie let's add
00:12 - another resource once again we want to
00:16 - add an existing file go to our desktop
00:20 - select a villain so when you're adding
00:24 - resources to your program what it does
00:26 - is it creates copies of that in the
00:28 - directory of your program and whenever
00:30 - you build your program it will run
00:32 - without you having to have those
00:34 - pictures in the same folder so if I
00:36 - didn't have these resources let's say
00:39 - for this for this picture if I didn't
00:41 - have that picture in the same folder it
00:43 - will not be able to load it because it's
00:45 - not actually there so adding resources
00:47 - is a good way to package everything your
00:49 - program needs inside of the program so
00:52 - let's just add our dragon and let's
00:58 - rename this to cartoon dragon and we'll
01:07 - rename this one just to make it look
01:10 - more like the other one so cartoon
01:14 - villain okay so now that we've added our
01:18 - Sambi villain and our dragon let's go
01:22 - ahead and come over here to form one BB
01:25 - we'll just double click on spawn enemy
01:28 - so whenever they click button spawn what
01:31 - we want to do is generate a random
01:34 - number and then pick based on that
01:36 - number so as new random so now that we
01:45 - have our random generator we want to set
01:47 - we want to get a random number from it
01:49 - so dim enemy type as integer I almost
01:59 - had that equal to generator dot next
02:05 - okay sorry about that alarm so generate
02:08 - it on next and we want it to be between
02:10 - 1 so 1 2 or 3 so now I'll just do a
02:16 - select case and we want the enemy type
02:22 - so for case 1 we will type picture enemy
02:30 - dot image is going to be equal to and
02:36 - we're going to have to access the
02:38 - resources of game GUI so to do this
02:43 - we'll just type my dot resources dot and
02:49 - you can see we've got cartoon dragon
02:51 - cartoon villain and cartoon zombie so
02:53 - we'll just do cartoon zombie and we'll
02:56 - do this for each one so picture enemy
03:00 - dot image equals my dot resources dot
03:06 - cartoon let's do a villain and then in
03:11 - case three picture enemy dot image
03:16 - equals my resources dot dragon now
03:24 - this is just a basic outline of what
03:27 - this is going to be doing whenever they
03:29 - spawn an enemy it will also have to
03:30 - create a new enemy object it'll have to
03:33 - set the health back on the progress bar
03:35 - and other stuff but for now we're just
03:38 - gonna worry about this so let's go ahead
03:40 - and run this
03:46 - let's go ahead and we need to come over
03:48 - here to our solution and we need to
03:51 - right-click on game GUI and let's just
03:55 - go ahead and set it as the startup
03:56 - project so now that it's the startup
03:59 - project we should be able to run this
04:05 - okay so here's our game and when we
04:07 - spawn it into me we can get either the
04:09 - zombie we get the villain and it's
04:19 - generating some weird numbers so go
04:25 - ahead put this code in if you already
04:27 - have it and they wants to do that move
04:28 - on to the next tutorial
