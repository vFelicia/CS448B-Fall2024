00:00 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:04 - how we geometrically prove that
00:07 - triangles are congruent so the important
00:11 - thing to talk about first is what do we
00:14 - mean by geometrically proof if I was to
00:18 - tell you to algebraically prove
00:20 - something you wouldn't use equations to
00:24 - solve for the sides and then that's how
00:27 - you could prove that they are congruent
00:30 - but instead we're going to geometrically
00:33 - prove it which means that we're going to
00:35 - take the theorems and the rules that
00:39 - we've learned up until now as reasons
00:43 - why these triangles are congruent so if
00:46 - you remember there's a bunch of
00:47 - different ways to prove triangles are
00:49 - congruent there's side side side side
00:53 - angle side angle side angle and H L so
01:01 - those are the kind of things we're going
01:02 - to use to prove that these triangles are
01:04 - congruent so that given so we're always
01:08 - going to start off with a given
01:10 - statement given D is the midpoint of AC
01:13 - and that a B is congruent to BC the
01:19 - directions should say prove triangles
01:22 - are congruent so first what we want to
01:28 - do is take note of the information they
01:29 - give us so we know that a B is congruent
01:32 - to BC and that's always going to be our
01:36 - first step
01:37 - our first statement is that a B is
01:41 - congruent to BC and our reason for that
01:45 - is simply given because we're told right
01:48 - here that that's true the next thing
01:51 - we're told is that D is the midpoint of
01:53 - AC so first we're going to say that D is
01:58 - the midpoint of a/c
02:04 - and that is also a given so if D is the
02:11 - midpoint of AC which is this segment
02:14 - right here if you remember what it means
02:17 - to be a midpoint that means that D
02:20 - divides AC into two congruent pieces so
02:27 - for our next thing we're going to say
02:29 - that a D is congruent to DC and then our
02:36 - reason is going to be the definition of
02:40 - a midpoint because that's how we know
02:45 - that these two are congruent okay so so
02:50 - far we have one pair of congruent sides
02:56 - two pairs of congruent sides so most
03:00 - likely we're going to be doing a
03:02 - side-side-side proof if you notice they
03:08 - share this side right here B D well we
03:16 - have this little theorem that says BD is
03:22 - congruent to BD because it's the same
03:26 - line so it has to have the same measure
03:28 - as itself and our reason for this is
03:32 - called the reflexive property
03:40 - that's like saying five is equal to five
03:43 - well obviously five has to equal five
03:46 - and the length of BD has to equal the
03:50 - length of BD so now we have three pairs
03:54 - of congruent sides so for our last step
03:58 - we can say therefore triangle a B D is
04:06 - congruent to triangle C B D by
04:14 - side-side-side that's how we always
04:20 - finish our proof is by saying therefore
04:23 - the triangles are congruent or therefore
04:26 - the parallelograms are congruent or
04:29 - something like that so now we're going
04:32 - to do one more practice proof for today
04:36 - so given that QT and is parallel to our
04:40 - s so QT is parallel to our s and QR is
04:48 - paralleled TS prove that triangle our q
04:58 - RT q is congruent to T our s
05:08 - so we're told that these two we have two
05:13 - pairs of parallel lines well if you
05:16 - remember there's a special kind of angle
05:19 - formed when when parallel lines are cut
05:23 - by a transversal so if we look at this
05:27 - these two parallel lines first this one
05:30 - and this one you can see that it's cut
05:32 - by this transversal TR and if you
05:36 - remember if you look these two
05:44 - these two parallel lines right here have
05:50 - this angle and this angle and if you
05:53 - remember these two angles are called
05:58 - alternate interior angles remember when
06:02 - that Z forms there's called alternate
06:07 - interior angles and alternate interior
06:11 - angles are congruent so we can say first
06:15 - we have to write down the given
06:17 - information QT parallel to our s and Q
06:24 - are parallel to tes and that's given
06:29 - okay so for our next thing we're going
06:32 - to say that angle 2 is congruent to
06:35 - angle 4 because of and our reason is
06:40 - that if lines are parallel then they're
06:49 - alternate interior angles are congruent
06:55 - now if you look we have two sets of
06:58 - parallel lines which means we have two
07:01 - sets of alternate interior angles so if
07:04 - we're talking about these two lines that
07:06 - are parallel and it's cut by this
07:09 - transversal you can see that angle 1 and
07:13 - angle 3 are alternate interior angles
07:16 - for those two lines so in the same step
07:19 - we can say that angle 1 is congruent to
07:23 - angle 3 and that has the same reason
07:27 - that if lines are parallel then they're
07:29 - alternate interior angles are congruent
07:32 - and we have one more step so far we have
07:36 - two pairs of congruent angles now if you
07:39 - look these two triangles share this side
07:44 - TR so TR is congruent to itself
07:52 - by the reflexive property and now if you
08:00 - look we have we have one angle congruent
08:07 - to one angle the included sides are
08:12 - congruent and we have another angle
08:15 - congruent to another angle if you
08:19 - remember there's a property called
08:20 - angle-side-angle oh I'm writing it on
08:27 - the wrong side
08:28 - so therefore the triangle RT q is
08:34 - congruent to triangle t are s by angle
08:40 - side angle so that's all we're doing
08:44 - with proofs today but make sure you come
08:47 - back and and we're going to be talking
08:52 - about constructing congruent segments in
08:56 - different kinds of segments we can
08:57 - construct
