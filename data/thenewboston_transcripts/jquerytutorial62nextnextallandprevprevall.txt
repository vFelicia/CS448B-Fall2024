00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're gonna be taking a
00:07 - look at the last and first parts of
00:09 - traversing in jQuery now obviously when
00:13 - we talk about traversing we talked about
00:14 - running over particular elements however
00:18 - this is part of a filter where we can
00:21 - select the first and last now much like
00:23 - we would do in for example selectors now
00:27 - I'm going to go ahead and create an
00:28 - unordered list with four names in and
00:31 - we'll go ahead and see the options that
00:33 - we have and how useful this can be so
00:36 - let's go ahead and create an unordered
00:37 - list and inside will create four Li
00:41 - elements of Li Li and once more and
00:50 - inside here let's go ahead and just put
00:52 - some values in so Alex Billy Dale and
00:57 - Ashley okay so let's go ahead and
01:00 - preview this now browser you can see
01:01 - we've just got a basic unordered list
01:03 - blah blah blah
01:04 - nothing really special let's go ahead
01:06 - and give this an ID of names now she'll
01:09 - give it a class of names more
01:11 - appropriate so nothing's changed we just
01:14 - now have a reference point for this
01:16 - unordered list and the it belongs to the
01:18 - class names so inside of ext ojs we have
01:22 - our document ready and we just go ahead
01:24 - and type this out again for those of you
01:26 - that don't quite understand we're
01:28 - selecting our document we're appending
01:30 - the ready event handle on the end and
01:32 - saibra craying a function so once our
01:35 - Dom has been loaded and you know we can
01:37 - just go ahead and work now this isn't a
01:39 - requirement but good practice to get
01:42 - into so the first thing we want to do is
01:45 - I'm going to go ahead and demonstrate
01:45 - the selector and then we're going to be
01:47 - taking a look at the the the actual
01:53 - function type call of it so let's go
01:56 - ahead and select ul or no sorry name two
02:02 - names and then Li and at first now this
02:05 - would be a this would allow us to sort
02:07 - of append on let's say
02:11 - first so we are selecting the class
02:15 - names which is here then we're selecting
02:18 - Li and the first Li so we're using a
02:20 - colon and first to append on first so
02:23 - let's refresh and you can see that we've
02:25 - just popped first onto the start of
02:27 - there now we could go ahead and let's
02:29 - say we'll copy this or we'll just retype
02:31 - it out so again we're saying dot names
02:35 - alive but well this time we're saying
02:36 - last and we're going to append on we're
02:41 - gonna append on the same pretty much the
02:43 - same thing but just last when we were
02:45 - afresh now you can see that that's been
02:46 - added on to the last now we have an
02:48 - alternative way of doing this and there
02:51 - are reasons for this and we're going to
02:53 - be using the find feature function as
02:56 - well as this first and last so I'm going
03:00 - to go ahead and demonstrate how we would
03:01 - do that as well so let's just say let's
03:04 - just go back to the start we want to
03:07 - find out the first li inside of this
03:09 - unordered list so let's go ahead and
03:12 - select first of all dot names which is
03:16 - our class this time I'm going to use
03:18 - find and we're going to be using that in
03:20 - conjunction with first and last and we
03:22 - want to choose what we want to find so
03:25 - Li for example now what we can go ahead
03:27 - and do is say dot first and now we can
03:36 - go ahead and append on some text so we
03:39 - can go ahead and append first and it's
03:46 - literally done the same job now one of
03:49 - the reasons I tend to do you know use
03:51 - this method is so I can actually use
03:56 - things like next as well I mean I know
03:59 - you can do this using normal selectors
04:01 - but find is a useful thing to use and
04:04 - get into the habit of using so you
04:06 - select the oh you know so the overall
04:08 - parent element and then you go ahead and
04:10 - find the Li and the first part of that
04:13 - and then append on first so we're doing
04:16 - the same thing so let's just run over
04:18 - again
04:19 - I mean by all means you can go over to
04:21 - the jQuery documentation and it has you
04:25 - know some more information on find and
04:27 - first/last and things like that but for
04:30 - now I'm going to go ahead and find the
04:32 - Li last and I'm gonna append on you know
04:35 - the same thing as I did before which is
04:36 - just last and when we refresh we have
04:39 - this so what I can also do is for
04:43 - example I could go on and say now I'm
04:46 - doing it sort of a long-winded way but
04:48 - you know never mind
04:50 - so I could say names dot find and then I
04:54 - could say Ally and then I could say dot
04:57 - first but then dot next and then dot end
05:01 - so I can sort of use so second well I'll
05:07 - just say after first for example or
05:09 - second it could be second make sense and
05:14 - when we refresh we have this second here
05:17 - so what I've done is I've combined find
05:19 - I'm looking for the Li first so the
05:21 - first element I'm picking out and then
05:24 - I'm going for the second element after
05:25 - the first element which is the second
05:28 - element so you know it will be element
05:30 - after the first element and that is
05:32 - second so I'm sort of combining things
05:34 - like this to pick out different values
05:36 - now there's a variety of reasons you
05:39 - might want to do this in in jQuery and
05:42 - that might be for example selecting
05:44 - either a predefined or we might want to
05:47 - go ahead and add a class onto the first
05:49 - and the last element or just on to the
05:52 - first element for example you might be
05:53 - menu building and you might want the
05:55 - first element in a in a list to be bold
06:00 - for example so we'll go ahead and just
06:03 - do that now just to demonstrate it let's
06:05 - just call this class here menu instead
06:08 - and I'm gonna school the fet while I'm
06:10 - going to say that the first element is
06:12 - ID now say user and the first is going
06:17 - to be settings and this one is going to
06:20 - be log out and this one is going to be
06:22 - delete account so Evans essentially now
06:26 - just got a
06:27 - you know an an unordered list of menu
06:30 - items I'm just gonna go ahead and open
06:32 - up style dot CSS and inside how I'm
06:37 - gonna style this ul so I'm gonna say dot
06:40 - menu and I'm gonna say list-style:none
06:46 - and this will just get rid of them
06:49 - bullet points and I'm then going to go
06:51 - ahead and set the margin to zero and
06:54 - that will get rid of the spacing there
06:56 - and then I'm gonna go ahead and step
06:57 - padding to zero as well and that will go
07:00 - ahead and get rid of that so we've still
07:01 - got a ul of menu items now now what we
07:05 - could go ahead and do is we could use
07:07 - next all and this takes into account
07:09 - everything after after the third or the
07:14 - element has been selected
