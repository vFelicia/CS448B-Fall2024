00:00 - uh so let's go ahead and just analyze
00:02 - how we could probably move this uh
00:03 - around uh so it removes
00:06 - it and essentially the problem that we
00:09 - have is that um every time the mouse is
00:12 - moved IE for every pixel that's moved uh
00:16 - what we were doing is let's me just
00:18 - bring this back here get rid of that one
00:21 - uh is we're removing the title attribute
00:23 - and then again we're grabbing the title
00:25 - attribute uh so this is uh sort of a bit
00:28 - of a problem
00:30 - um so what we want to do is we want to
00:31 - go ahead uh and make sure that we're
00:34 - removing this uh but then we're sort of
00:36 - like reinstating it so we're re sort of
00:39 - displaying it again so we could go ahead
00:41 - and do
00:42 - this title there so essentially then
00:45 - what we're doing is we're hiding it but
00:47 - then we're showing our div and then
00:49 - we're putting it back again so hopefully
00:51 - this works I'm sure it will I don't know
00:53 - it hasn't uh that's a shame uh so let's
00:56 - go ahead and see what we can do
01:02 - uh and the problem that we face as well
01:04 - is we can't move this up here uh or it
01:07 - will take uh all um it will take you
01:11 - know sort of like all the a tags um you
01:14 - know in its place uh so let me just have
01:17 - a think about how we could probably do
01:19 - this okay so uh yeah I think what we
01:23 - could actually do is we could use the
01:24 - mouse in um the mouse in event handler
01:29 - uh to to grab the
01:31 - title um and then hide the um attribute
01:35 - as well so let's go ahead and just maybe
01:37 - uh pen this onto the end of here so
01:39 - we'll say mouse in and then
01:43 - function and let's go ahead and go ahead
01:46 - and get rid of this title so we'll say
01:48 - this do
01:49 - attribute
01:52 - title uh it's nothing uh so let's see if
01:55 - this
01:56 - helps it hasn't so um
02:02 - mouse mouse over I think
02:05 - maybe no not at all okay so
02:10 - um a let's have I think about this I
02:14 - guess this is extremely annoying uh but
02:16 - in terms of learning uh I guess it could
02:19 - be quite good uh let's just say uh maybe
02:23 - Focus we're setting the attribute title
02:25 - to
02:26 - nothing um but
02:30 - yeah I tell you what okay so okay so
02:32 - solution um this is going to work so
02:36 - just before this I'm going to go ahead
02:37 - and use the
02:39 - um the mouse
02:42 - in uh event handler uh and then I'm
02:45 - going to create a function from
02:48 - this and just pull this down a
02:50 - bit okay so now what we're going to do
02:53 - is we're going to put we get the title
02:55 - when we Mouse
02:57 - in and then when when we we um when we
03:02 - sorry yeah also when we Mouse in we want
03:04 - to go ahead and remove the attribute so
03:06 - this do
03:08 - attribute title is nothing and that way
03:12 - uh when the mouse comes in we're gaining
03:14 - this variable and storing it but then
03:15 - removing the title attribute and then on
03:18 - Mouse out we want to go ahead and sort
03:20 - of restore this so we want to say this
03:22 - do
03:24 - attribute title title uh which being the
03:29 - variable we we've already created so
03:31 - fingers crossed this works uh and
03:33 - nothing's worked there so we might have
03:35 - some kind of error in our code let's
03:38 - just have a look so this mouse in Mouse
03:43 - move I think it's
03:46 - maybe Focus we'll use
03:49 - instead let's go ahead and
03:52 - refresh no so there must be an error
03:55 - here somewhere uh that probably
03:57 - someone's pointed out already uh let's
03:59 - let take a
04:01 - look so this do Focus
04:05 - function
04:14 - um okay let's just go ahead and alert
04:17 - something out here uh just to check that
04:19 - this is
04:22 - okay so we'll just say working and we'll
04:26 - refresh yeah and we don't get an alert
04:28 - over which tells me that there's
04:29 - something wrong uh with this um
04:37 - code and that
04:40 - is I don't know because I can't find
04:42 - this problem so oh no sorry it's focus
04:45 - in oh dear okay right so yeah um oh no
04:48 - it still hasn't worked uh let's
04:53 - check no that's extremely
04:56 - annoying let's go ahead and alert out
04:59 - something
05:03 - again so I want to say
05:06 - alert working and refresh and nothing's
05:10 - working
05:13 - so this. focus in which would be an a
05:17 - tag focus in function we've got our
05:20 - function block there that lines up VAR
05:22 - title is equal to this do attribute
05:25 - title and then this do attribute title
05:30 - is nothing so we've already grabbed this
05:32 - variable
05:34 - beforehand then on Mouse move after we
05:37 - focused in we grab these and we place
05:40 - the title in that was all working so it
05:43 - must be some sort of small logical error
05:46 - I think in my part let's just try it
05:48 - without the VAR no
