00:01 - so our focus is on regular polygons
00:04 - specifically the angle measures in a
00:07 - regular polygon so first you need to
00:10 - remember that a regular polygon has all
00:13 - sides that are congruent and all angles
00:15 - that are congruent that's what makes
00:17 - them
00:18 - a regular
00:21 - polygon so to find the measure of one
00:24 - angle in a Rel regular polygon you're
00:28 - going to find the sum of the angles
00:32 - which you can do by drawing in your
00:35 - diagonals and multiplying by
00:46 - 180 and then divide by the
00:49 - number
00:52 - of divide by the number of
00:55 - angles so this leads us to this little
00:59 - formula right right
01:01 - here which allows us to do this in one
01:04 - step so
01:06 - n is the number of
01:11 - sides or
01:13 - angles because this this is a hexagon so
01:17 - it has 1 2 3 4 five six sides but it
01:22 - also has 1 2 3 four five six
01:26 - angles so you take the number number of
01:30 - sides or the number of angles which is
01:33 - six youus 2 and times it by
01:38 - 180 this top part is number one finding
01:43 - the sum of the angles and this and when
01:46 - you divide by the number of
01:49 - sides you're doing when you divide by
01:52 - six you're doing number two and we're
01:54 - just doing it one step so the measure of
01:57 - angle one is equal to 720 / 6 which
02:04 - gives us an answer of
02:07 - 120 so the measure of angle one right
02:10 - here is
02:13 - 120 and that means since it's a regular
02:18 - polygon that every one of these
02:22 - angle also measures
02:26 - 120°
02:28 - so we know that this is
02:32 - a
02:35 - regular
02:38 - quadrilateral which is also known as a
02:41 - square and we know and since it's
02:44 - regular that means these are
02:46 - all congruent and we know that the
02:49 - length of one side is four so that means
02:51 - all the sides measure
02:55 - four so if we want to find the measure
02:59 - of of this angle angle X right here
03:02 - we're going to plug it into our
03:04 - formula so we have four sides so that
03:08 - means n = 4 so 4 * 2 4 - 2 *
03:14 - 180 /
03:17 - 4 gives us 2 * 180 /
03:23 - 4 360 / 4 means that the measure of
03:28 - angle X is equal to 90
03:35 - so for the next
03:37 - one we
03:39 - know that
03:44 - these sides all these angles are
03:47 - congruent and these sides are congruent
03:50 - because it's a regular triangle or an
03:55 - equilateral
03:57 - triangle so we to find the measure of
04:02 - angle we're going to call this
04:03 - y we take 3 - 2 *
04:09 - 180 /
04:12 - 3 is equal to 180 / by 3 which equals
04:18 - 60 you also could have solved it using
04:21 - your knowledge of the interior angles of
04:24 - a
04:25 - triangle since the sum of a triangle is
04:28 - 180
04:30 - de and there are three
04:32 - equal angles you could have just divided
04:36 - by
04:37 - that by three and gotten
04:40 - 60° either way you get the same
04:44 - answer so we're going to do it now for a
04:46 - regular de decagon and if you remember a
04:52 - decagon equals 12 sides so our n is 12
04:58 - so the measure of of we're just going to
05:01 - call it angle
05:02 - one is equal to 12 - 2 *
05:07 - 180 over 12 so you get 10 * 180 over
05:14 - 12 and if you put that into a calculator
05:18 - you'll get the measure of one angle is
05:22 - 150° so a regular 100 gone so that means
05:27 - there's 100 sides
05:30 - so the measure of one
05:32 - angle 100 - 2 * 180 over 100 and we're
05:39 - just once again we're just going to plug
05:40 - that into the Cal and you'll get
05:59 - make sure you come back because in our
06:01 - next lesson we're going to talk about
06:04 - specific types of
06:06 - polygons starting with
06:10 - parallelograms
