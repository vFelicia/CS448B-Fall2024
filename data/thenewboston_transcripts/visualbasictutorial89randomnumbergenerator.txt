00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - making a random number generator so go
00:10 - ahead and select a new project we will
00:13 - select windows forms application and we
00:15 - will call it random generator then we'll
00:21 - go ahead and click OK now before we get
00:24 - started I want to talk to you guys about
00:26 - something
00:27 - computers cannot truly be random because
00:31 - computers always follow a set set set
00:35 - instructions and they cannot decide for
00:39 - themselves or make random decisions now
00:41 - the random class is the best attempt at
00:46 - this that the dotnet developers have
00:48 - created and I'll show you a little flaw
00:51 - with that now here is a small
00:53 - application that I made in about 10
00:57 - minutes just to show you guys that
01:00 - computers aren't really random so if I
01:02 - start this random animation you can see
01:05 - that it starts drawing on these graphics
01:09 - right here you can see that as a trend
01:11 - it's going up and to the left and it
01:14 - just keeps doing that now if we leave
01:18 - this running after a while you will see
01:20 - that lines just streak up into the left
01:22 - over and over and over again now we will
01:24 - be making this closer to the end of the
01:27 - series of tutorials when we get into
01:28 - graphics just so I could show you guys
01:30 - how the random class works and how it
01:33 - isn't really random so um let's go ahead
01:37 - and get started I'll leave this running
01:39 - back here so we can come look at it
01:41 - after the tutorial is over so go ahead
01:44 - and resize this we will come over here
01:46 - to our tool box and we will add a list
01:49 - box and we will add a button and we go
01:57 - ahead and make this a little bit larger
02:07 - okay so let's go ahead and set the name
02:11 - of the list box to list random numbers
02:16 - and we'll set the text value off the
02:18 - button to random numbers and we'll go
02:24 - ahead and set the name to button
02:29 - generate so let's go ahead and double
02:32 - click on random numbers and we'll zoom
02:34 - in once we get in here okay so now what
02:38 - we need to do is we need to create an
02:39 - object of the random class now in the
02:42 - next couple tutorials we're going to be
02:44 - learning about making classes now we
02:46 - have used objects before so this is kind
02:50 - of something that you need to learn
02:51 - leading up to making class your own
02:53 - classes and stuff so when you create an
02:55 - object of a class it's pretty much like
02:56 - making a variable it takes that class
02:58 - and makes a little a copy of that class
03:03 - that you can change the values call the
03:05 - methods call the functions and it exists
03:09 - all on its own and has nothing to do
03:11 - with the original class and you can make
03:13 - as many objects of a class as you want
03:15 - so let's go ahead and declare let's just
03:19 - do generator as new random so now that
03:26 - we have made a new random object we're
03:29 - going to go ahead and print out all
03:31 - these random numbers to the list box so
03:33 - we'll go ahead and do we will make a
03:37 - do-while loop so do and we'll just type
03:43 - list let's see what are the name of our
03:46 - list box was list random numbers dot
03:52 - atoms dot add and we'll type generator
03:57 - dot next and it returns a non-negative
04:02 - random number of type integer so it will
04:06 - just set a limit for this so we'll do
04:10 - from value 0 to value 20 and then we'll
04:14 - go ahead and convert that to a string
04:17 - okay so what this does is it uses our
04:20 - annum class object and it generates a
04:22 - random number between the value of 0 and
04:25 - 20 by using the next function and then
04:28 - we went ahead and converted that integer
04:30 - to a string to add to our list box so
04:34 - what we want to do is let's come up here
04:36 - and create a variable so we'll declare
04:43 - my R and as integer and we will set it
04:48 - equal to generator dot next and we'll go
04:57 - from 0 to 20 now let's go ahead and take
05:01 - out this right here because this will
05:04 - generate two different numbers so I'll
05:06 - just go ahead and type my R and sorry I
05:11 - didn't think of this later but um so now
05:14 - that our generator or our random number
05:18 - is stored in a variable we can loop
05:20 - while my R and is equal to a certain
05:24 - while it is not equal to a certain value
05:27 - so let's go ahead and loop while my R
05:29 - and does not equal 5 and let's go ahead
05:35 - and declare this outside of the loop so
05:38 - that it can be used there so we'll just
05:41 - take this out and we will type my R and
05:45 - equals generator dot next okay so well
05:51 - this is going to do is it's going to
05:52 - keep running out random numbers while my
05:55 - R and is not equal to 5 and once it
05:57 - equals 5 it is going to stop the adding
06:02 - the numbers to it so let's go ahead and
06:05 - bring this over here and we'll go ahead
06:07 - and click random numbers so you can see
06:09 - that it adds 0 11 and 5 and then when we
06:13 - do it this time it gets to 15 4 16 10 to
06:19 - 19 14 13 and it goes all the way and it
06:23 - generates a whole bunch of random
06:23 - numbers until it's five and then it
06:28 - it stops doing that so let's go ahead
06:31 - and type list random numbers dot atoms
06:36 - dot clear so each time we click the
06:38 - button it's going to clear the list box
06:40 - and give us a new clean list box so we
06:45 - got lucky on this one and the first time
06:46 - I generated a number it was equal to
06:48 - five and when we did it this time we get
06:51 - a whole bunch of numbers and then
06:53 - finally the last one is equal to five
06:55 - and it stops the loop so go ahead and
06:59 - create a couple random numbers by using
07:03 - the next and you can specify the the
07:07 - limit here and you can also do some
07:12 - other stuff so play around with that and
07:13 - see what else you can do you don't have
07:15 - to use this you don't have to use loops
07:17 - but just once you get familiar with the
07:19 - random class and how to use it go ahead
07:22 - and move on to the next tutorial and
07:23 - thanks for watching
