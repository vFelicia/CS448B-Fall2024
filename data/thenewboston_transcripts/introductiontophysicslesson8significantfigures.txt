00:00 - what is going on guys it's buy and
00:02 - welcome to your eth physics tutorial and
00:04 - in this tutorial I want to talk to you
00:05 - guys about something called significant
00:07 - figures now a significant figure is
00:10 - basically a way of saying how precise
00:13 - should your answers be whenever you're
00:15 - working with scientific notation so you
00:17 - know before when we were working
00:19 - scientific notation we got numbers like
00:22 - 1.53 2 1 7 and maybe those numbers went
00:26 - on and on forever well if you're saying
00:29 - all right so so how do I know how many
00:32 - decimal places I'm supposed to write in
00:33 - my answer well there actually is an
00:36 - answer to that question and it isn't
00:38 - just basically however many you feel
00:40 - like there's actually a rhyme and a
00:42 - reason to it and it makes a lot of sense
00:44 - so hopefully by the end of these
00:46 - tutorials you guys are going to
00:47 - understand the importance and the
00:50 - significance to significant figures
00:53 - should I have said it like that probably
00:54 - not but you guys know what I mean so
00:57 - basically let me go ahead and tell you a
00:59 - story from my childhood and this is
01:01 - going to you know definitely um explain
01:04 - to you guys how and why significant
01:07 - figures are
01:08 - important so when I was in high school I
01:10 - used to be on the wrestling team and I
01:12 - was always obsessed about my weight so I
01:16 - had a scale at my house that I weighed
01:18 - myself multiple times a day so one day I
01:22 - weighed myself and the scale
01:24 - said 165 PBS it only had enough data to
01:30 - round it to the nearest pound again if
01:32 - you wanted to buy a scale that you know
01:34 - gave you a tenth of a pound like
01:38 - 165.1 75 those cost like thousands and
01:41 - thousands of dollars to get a scale that
01:44 - accurate so we only had you know a dumb
01:47 - scale that we bought at Kmart so it only
01:49 - gave us my weight to the nearest pound
01:52 - so I walk in wrestling practice one day
01:55 - and my coach says all right Bucky how
01:58 - much do you weigh and I tell him
02:00 - 165 lbs and he looks at me I look a
02:03 - little bit chubby like I'm overweight
02:04 - like I'm not going to make weight for
02:06 - the tournament and he says you know what
02:08 - I don't believe you get on the scale so
02:11 - I go ahead and hop on the scale and if
02:13 - you never wrestled in high school before
02:16 - they have really precise expensive
02:18 - scales so in fact whenever I got on that
02:21 - scale it said
02:26 - 16538 so he's like bucky bucky bucky you
02:29 - you lied to me you told me you weighed
02:32 - 165 and whenever I said that he was
02:35 - assuming it was
02:37 - 165.000 when in fact I weighed more than
02:41 - 165 so was I lying to him well I wasn't
02:44 - exactly lying to them but you know the
02:47 - results were different so with that
02:50 - being said that is basically the
02:52 - importance of significant figures
02:54 - whenever you're working with significant
02:57 - figures you can only claim
03:00 - your answer to be is accurate is the
03:03 - least accurate factor and you're going
03:06 - to see what I'm talking about whenever
03:08 - I'm working with this in scientific
03:09 - notation but basically what I'm trying
03:11 - to say is whenever you're using
03:13 - scientific notation especially with
03:15 - multiplication and division your answer
03:17 - can't be more precise than your least
03:21 - precise factor and by that I mean you
03:24 - can't assume this number is
03:28 - 165.000 because we don't have the
03:30 - equipment to verify that we can only
03:34 - assume we can only basically work with
03:36 - whole numbers since this information
03:39 - right here is unknown so we can't just
03:41 - claim it to be whatever we want it to so
03:44 - let me go ahead and give you guys
03:46 - another example go ahead and change my
03:48 - color a little bit I change it to green
03:50 - or something like that so basically say
03:54 - you and your friend wanted to start uh I
03:57 - don't know like selling potatoes on the
04:00 - side of the road like that's a good idea
04:02 - so you go ahead and I'm going to go
04:04 - ahead and weigh all the potatoes I own
04:07 - first and remember I have that cheap
04:09 - scale from Kmart or Walmart wherever I
04:11 - said I got it from so I only can wait to
04:14 - the nearest whole pound so it says I
04:18 - have 20 pounds of potatoes pretty cool
04:22 - so I call up my friend and his dad is a
04:25 - doctor he always gets the nicest clothes
04:28 - the nicest shoes so he has this super
04:30 - fancy Mega scale so he weighs his
04:33 - potatoes and of course he has more
04:35 - potatoes than I do he has
04:40 - 3287 pounds of potatoes so we say all
04:44 - right we're going to go ahead and add up
04:46 - our potatoes to see how much money we
04:48 - can make however we can't say that we
04:52 - have 50
04:55 - 2.87 lbs of potatoes because that number
04:59 - May or may not be accurate and the
05:01 - reason for that is because if you guys
05:03 - don't understand this 20 right here it
05:07 - may or may not be
05:09 - 20.0 this number 20 accidentally deleted
05:14 - that okay let's clear this up this
05:17 - number 20 right here can be anything
05:19 - from like
05:21 - 19.5 to
05:25 - 2049 and we really don't know to add
05:30 - 19.5 to
05:32 - this or to add 2049 or anything in
05:36 - between so really all this information
05:39 - to the right of the decimal point is
05:41 - pretty much just a guess so the only
05:43 - information that we really want to work
05:45 - with is this what we need to do is
05:48 - whenever we add this together together
05:51 - what the heck together we basically need
05:54 - to round in other words get rid of this
05:57 - so we can only say we have 50
06:01 - three and we can't even use a decimal
06:03 - place we can only say we have 53 pounds
06:06 - of potatoes if we want around or to be
06:09 - on the safe side we can just say we have
06:11 - 52 and you know it will work out like
06:13 - that but basically what I'm trying to
06:15 - say is whenever you work with
06:17 - significant figures you can't claim to
06:20 - have more information than you really do
06:22 - because these numbers right here are
06:25 - basically just question marks so you
06:27 - can't just go ahead and throw in
06:28 - anything there you like you can only
06:31 - have an answer that's as accurate as
06:33 - your least precise piece of equipment so
06:37 - that's basically what I'm trying to say
06:38 - hopefully you understand the importance
06:40 - of significant figures and why and how
06:44 - we need to use them so in the next
06:47 - tutorials what I'm going to be doing is
06:49 - I'm going to be showing you a real quick
06:50 - example of multiplication and division
06:53 - and I'm going to show you how what we
06:55 - did in the last tutorials were wrong and
06:58 - how to correct it so so with that being
07:00 - said thank you guys for watching don't
07:01 - forget to subscribe and I'll see you
07:03 - guys in the next tutorial
