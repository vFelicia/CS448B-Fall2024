00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - let's see what tutorial it is n9th I
00:04 - think it's our ninth physics tutorial
00:06 - and in this tutorial now that we know
00:08 - the importance and how we understand the
00:11 - need for sig figs we can go ahead and
00:13 - start using them in our scientific
00:15 - notation problem so what I did is I went
00:18 - and grabbed a couple problems from
00:19 - tutorial 5 and tutorial six and back
00:23 - then whenever we were working with
00:25 - scientific notation we didn't know about
00:28 - significant figures and by the way I
00:29 - don't know if I mentioned this but
00:31 - sometimes I call significant figures
00:33 - sigfigs just because it sounds cool so
00:36 - anyways now that we know about Sig fix
00:39 - we can go ahead and solve these problems
00:41 - again and we're going to solve them
00:43 - correctly this time so what we need to
00:46 - do is go ahead and solve these problems
00:47 - again so 6.71 * 10 3 * 2.3 * 10 5th
00:53 - power =
00:56 - 6.71 * 2.3
01:01 - times and I might skip a couple steps
01:05 - here 10 to the 3 + 5 which is
01:09 - eight so basically what we have is
01:15 - 15.4
01:17 - 33 time 10 to 8th so in our last
01:22 - tutorial or not our last tutorial
01:24 - tutorial number five I think it was our
01:26 - final answer was 1
01:31 - 5
01:33 - 433 * 10 to the 9th power now you're
01:38 - saying all right that answer looks
01:40 - pretty correct to me but we need to
01:42 - consider the rules of sigfigs so in
01:45 - order to do that when working with
01:47 - scientific notation we need to look at
01:49 - how many digits are in the least
01:52 - accurate number or coefficient as
01:55 - they're properly called the coefficient
01:56 - is the number that's not the one with
01:59 - exponent so basically what we're going
02:01 - to be doing is saying all right this
02:03 - number has one 2 3 and this number has
02:07 - one two so remember in the last tutorial
02:10 - when I was talking about how our scales
02:13 - had different accuracies well pretend
02:15 - that we're measuring these with scales
02:17 - right here this scale would only go to
02:19 - the tenth place and I just changed my
02:22 - color to red and my text is red this
02:26 - scale only goes to the tth and this
02:28 - scale goes to the hundreds so basically
02:31 - we can only use an answer that goes to
02:35 - the tth so basically our correct answer
02:38 - would be
02:40 - 1.5 and I got 1.5 from rounding
02:44 - 1.54 times 10 to the 9th and again the
02:48 - reason for that is because we can't just
02:51 - go ahead and include these numbers
02:53 - because we don't know for a fact that
02:56 - this is 2.30
03:00 - so we can't claim to have more
03:02 - information than you know we just can't
03:04 - make up information like that because
03:06 - our equipment wasn't that accurate
03:08 - whenever we got this data right there so
03:10 - let me go ahead and give you guys one
03:12 - more example and I need to change my
03:14 - color
03:15 - again so actually let me go ahead and
03:17 - get out my piece of paper right here for
03:19 - my tutorial make sure I'm working with
03:22 - the right PR so
03:25 - 7.62 yeah that's going to pop up and by
03:27 - the way I think whenever I make uh my
03:30 - YouTube videos they always try to let me
03:34 - see if I can get
03:35 - it it won't even do it now but they
03:37 - always put the thumbnail as whatever I'm
03:41 - whenever that box pops up and it's
03:42 - really annoying because like uh it looks
03:45 - like I'm making a mistake on all my
03:46 - videos which I kind of am but do you
03:49 - guys know what I'm talking about when
03:50 - well never mind again I'm just rambling
03:52 - I'll stop doing that so let's go ahead
03:55 - and solve this problem I'll shut up 7.62
04:00 - again we're dividing so we have to put
04:02 - divide by
04:05 - 2.1 and then we go ahead and multiply
04:08 - that by 10 to the
04:12 - 3/ by 10 to the
04:15 - 5th so let's go ahead and solve both
04:17 - sides of these equations 7.62 / 2.1 =
04:23 - 3 6
04:25 - 29 and we need to go ahead and multiply
04:28 - that and I'm just going to go ahead and
04:29 - skip a step here 3 - 5 = -2 so that's 10
04:36 - to -2 so we go ahead and basically in
04:40 - our sixth physics tutorial we said that
04:43 - this was the final answer right there
04:46 - however now that we know about
04:48 - significant figures let's go ahead and
04:50 - take a look at this data up here this
04:52 - one only goes to the tenth of one place
04:56 - and this one goes to the 100th so
04:58 - basically our answer can only go to the
05:01 - 10th because that's our least accurate
05:04 - piece of information right there so what
05:06 - we need to do is we need to round this
05:08 - answer to the nearest 10th so
05:13 - 3.6 * 10 to the2 is our correct answer
05:18 - that's what we should have had because
05:20 - again like I said this data right here
05:23 - we don't know for certain how accurate
05:26 - that is we only have the equipment to
05:28 - measure to the temp
05:30 - so that's what our answer should be
05:31 - right here so now that you know the
05:34 - importance of significant figures and
05:36 - also
05:38 - basically saw those examples in real
05:41 - life examples saw those examples in real
05:44 - life examples what the heck am I talking
05:46 - about well anyways now that we saw that
05:48 - in practice we can begin to move on to
05:50 - something else however there are a
05:52 - couple different rules that I think I
05:55 - better tell you guys before you know
05:57 - jump into math and physics and atoms and
06:00 - electricity and stuff like that so
06:02 - definitely check out the next tutorial
06:03 - and um if you guys have any questions
06:06 - about sigfigs or physics at all I should
06:09 - probably mention this in last couple
06:11 - tutorials make sure to check out my
06:12 - Forum at the new boston.com
06:15 - forum and you can ask me questions there
06:17 - and I will be happy to answer them for
06:19 - you guys so anyways thank you guys for
06:21 - watching and uh don't forget to
06:22 - subscribe and I will see you in the next
