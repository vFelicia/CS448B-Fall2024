00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash the on life gamer for the new
00:04 - Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna
00:06 - be working on the game now if you
00:09 - remember from the previous tutorial we
00:11 - had it randomly generate an enemy based
00:13 - on well whenever we click spawn enemy it
00:17 - randomly generates an enemy now you can
00:19 - see I set the image of this to a zombie
00:22 - at the beginning because I added some
00:25 - stuff to the button spawned so that it
00:31 - checks to see if there's already an
00:32 - image in there now it didn't actually
00:35 - work out the way I wanted it to but you
00:38 - can look at it if you want I just check
00:40 - to see if the image equals the zombie
00:43 - then I'm just going to go ahead and set
00:44 - enemy type equal to a next to another
00:48 - integer this didn't work out too well
00:50 - because when it does that it doesn't
00:52 - send it back up to the top of the Select
00:53 - case so basically what I wanted to tell
00:58 - you is to set this to 4 and not 3
01:01 - because it generates 1 it can either be
01:03 - 1 all the way up to 3 it can you don't
01:06 - go one below the max value now this that
01:10 - I added right here works some time
01:11 - sometimes but not all the time so if you
01:15 - want to put that in you can go ahead and
01:16 - do that so go ahead and run this and you
01:19 - can see what happens if you spot an
01:22 - enemy you can see it spawned a villain
01:24 - then a dragon then a zombie a zombie
01:27 - again
01:30 - you can see it's a little more random
01:32 - now and we can spawn different enemies
01:34 - it's not spawning the same one over and
01:36 - over again sometimes we'll get the same
01:38 - one over but it works a little bit
01:41 - better than it did before
01:42 - so I'll just go back to this code you
01:45 - can pause it right here if you need to
01:50 - so put that in if you want it's not
01:53 - necessary but it will help a little bit
01:57 - so what we need to do in order to use
01:59 - our classes from our game class library
02:03 - we need to have game GUI selected and we
02:06 - need to come up here to project and we
02:08 - need to add a reference now we need to
02:10 - reference the dll that we created by you
02:15 - by creating our class library next see
02:17 - there's a whole bunch of stuff that we
02:18 - can reference that's built into the
02:22 - dotnet framework you see I've got a
02:23 - whole bunch of stuff right here we're
02:25 - just gonna select projects and we'll
02:26 - select the game project and we'll click
02:29 - OK
02:31 - ok so we'll come up here and right
02:34 - before forum 1 let's go ahead and create
02:37 - a private variable so we'll do private
02:40 - current enemy now we're not going to set
02:44 - this to an age certain type right now
02:45 - we're gonna do that whenever they spawn
02:47 - an enemy so if they spawn let's say a
02:50 - zombie will type current enemy equals
02:56 - and we want to create a new instance of
02:58 - zombie now since we added a reference to
03:00 - that DLL file what we can do is type
03:08 - enemies library dot Sambi so current
03:14 - enemy is now a zombie and so now that we
03:18 - could our current enemy what we want to
03:20 - do is set some values for this progress
03:23 - bar so we'll come over here and first we
03:27 - need to come over here to the properties
03:28 - and we need to find the max value which
03:32 - is 100 which is what we want it to be so
03:35 - then we'll type progress bar or progress
03:40 - bar enemy sorry I got interrupted there
03:45 - so progress bar enemy dot value is gonna
03:48 - be equal to 100 so let's go ahead and
03:52 - run this and you can see was spawning
03:55 - into me let's spawn until we get a
03:57 - zombie so we spawned a zombie and you
03:59 - can see it set the progress of our value
04:00 - progress bar value equal to
04:03 - 100 now let's go ahead and do this for
04:06 - each of the cases so current enemy it's
04:13 - going to be equal to a new enemies
04:16 - library dot and we're going to do a
04:22 - villain VB now let me get this out of
04:28 - the way real quick you can see that we
04:30 - accidentally made the class villain vbv
04:33 - B instead of just villain but we don't
04:37 - really need to change that so we set the
04:41 - current enemy and to a new villain now
04:46 - let's go ahead and set the progress bar
04:48 - but one thing that we should do instead
04:50 - of just setting the value equal to 100
04:52 - when you just use indirection
04:54 - so we'll use current enemy dot
05:05 - health so you can see that if we try to
05:08 - access health it's not there that's
05:12 - because when we created this variable
05:14 - it's not said to any sort of data type
05:17 - so what we can do is use polymorphism
05:20 - so if we use enemy's library dot enemy
05:24 - we can create we can make this current
05:26 - enemy any type of enemy we want we can
05:29 - make it a zombie a villain or a dragon
05:31 - and it will it can still be represented
05:35 - as an enemy
05:35 - so if we use current enemy dot health
05:39 - now you can see that it will show up and
05:44 - that we can use it so we just need to
05:46 - use current enemy dot health here so
05:50 - this way instead of having to know the
05:52 - values ourselves and setting them when
05:54 - we create this you know just get the
05:58 - stuff that's already there for us to use
06:00 - so current enemy equals new enemies
06:07 - library dot dragon and then progress bar
06:12 - enemy dot value is going to be equal to
06:18 - current enemy dot health
06:26 - okay so now that we've added the stuff
06:30 - that we need to create a new enemy
06:31 - object and then set the value of the
06:33 - progress bar let's go ahead and test
06:35 - this out and see if everything works
06:36 - fine so let's go ahead and we can spawn
06:39 - an enemy and we spawned a zombie spawn
06:43 - that guy we can spawn the villain we
06:46 - just want the dragon and each time it's
06:49 - actually resetting this progress bar and
06:50 - we just can't see it so go ahead put
06:56 - this code in if you have it you can add
06:59 - this if-else in diff right here if you
07:01 - want and then make sure you make objects
07:03 - and set the value of the progress bar
07:05 - and once you've done all that go ahead
07:07 - and move on to the next tutorial where
07:09 - we will continue working on this project
