00:02 - okay so today we're going to work with
00:05 - solving combined equation equations so
00:09 - we're going to take what we learned in
00:11 - our past two lessons and put them
00:13 - together to solve for our
00:16 - variable so right here we have 7 * the
00:20 - quty of x + 2 =
00:24 - -35 so normally if we were using our
00:27 - order of operations we would do what's
00:30 - inside the parentheses first and then do
00:33 - the
00:33 - multiplication but because we don't know
00:35 - what x equals we have to do our ordering
00:39 - a little differently so what we're going
00:41 - to do first is we're going to use a
00:43 - property called the distributive
00:46 - property and we're going to take this
00:48 - seven and multiply it by this X and
00:52 - multi and also multiply it by this
00:55 - two so we have 7 x + 14 =
01:01 - -35 and we're allowed to do that because
01:04 - of this
01:05 - property
01:08 - which which we multiply the seven by
01:11 - both of these so it would be the same as
01:14 - if we added them first and then
01:17 - multiplied so now normally we would do
01:21 - we would undo division first but since
01:24 - our whole since our whole um point is to
01:28 - get this variable by itself we're going
01:30 - to subtract this 14 over first so we get
01:34 - 7 x is equal to
01:37 - -49 now finally we can
01:42 - do we can divide that seven out and we
01:44 - get negative
01:46 - 7 so the whole point is to get
01:50 - X by itself so we work with the things
01:54 - that are farthest away from X first if
01:57 - that makes sense
02:00 - okay so for this one same thing we're
02:04 - going to wait to leave this five till
02:06 - last since it it's closest to the X so
02:09 - we're going to plus three to both sides
02:12 - we get 5x is equal to 25 now we can
02:16 - divide by five and we get X is equal to
02:20 - 5 okay so the same thing goes right here
02:24 - normally we do division or
02:26 - multiplication first but if if we were
02:30 - to undo this division we would have to
02:33 - multiply every single term by four so
02:36 - it's easier just to collect these like
02:39 - terms first and then multiply so we're
02:43 - going to add six to both sides and we
02:46 - get ne or POS 5 is equal to- y over 4
02:52 - now we're going to multiply by the
02:55 - reciprocal and we get- Y is = to 20 and
03:01 - then we're going to divide that -1 over
03:04 - we get Y is equal to
03:07 - -20 the same principle applies over here
03:11 - plus 23 on both
03:14 - sides so we
03:17 - get 51 is equal to 17x over
03:21 - 32 we're going to multiply it by its
03:26 - reciprocal and these are pretty big
03:28 - numbers so I'm going to have to plug
03:29 - these into a
03:30 - calculator so if you multiply 32 by 51
03:35 - we get 1 6 32 and if you divide it by 17
03:39 - you get X is equal to
03:42 - 96 so we have one last problem we're
03:44 - going to
03:48 - do we're going to take this four and
03:51 - subtract it
03:53 - over 2x over 5 is = to
03:58 - -16 multiply by the
04:01 - reciprocal get X is equal and here we
04:05 - can reduce by twos so this becomes one
04:07 - this becomes 88 * 5 is
04:12 - -4 so that's it for our lesson today but
04:17 - um make sure you come back and watch our
04:20 - next lesson where we're going to talk
04:23 - about solving equations with variables
04:25 - on both sides
