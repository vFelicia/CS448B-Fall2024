00:00 - ah right yeah so we got our template set
00:02 - up looking good
00:03 - and check this out so whenever we click
00:05 - read it's going to take us to the
00:07 - details view for that Taylor Swift album
00:08 - whenever we click skatepark is going to
00:11 - take us to the details view from that
00:13 - band that I you know I knew in high
00:15 - school but check this out
00:17 - whenever we go to the URL like forty
00:21 - three hmm you see we don't have an album
00:24 - with ID of forty three yet our web page
00:27 - is going to try to display this and
00:29 - that's usually not a good thing because
00:31 - what we want to do is if the user or if
00:35 - we go to a website and we don't have the
00:37 - resources to actually display
00:38 - information we want to send a 404 so I
00:42 - know you guys have been in those
00:43 - websites before it says 404 error that
00:46 - means that I don't know like maybe
00:47 - someone made a post and deleted it or
00:50 - maybe someone like had a item on their
00:53 - shop for sale but it got sold out so
00:55 - they just deleted it basically a 404
00:57 - means we don't have the resources to
01:00 - display or it got deleted or something
01:02 - like that
01:02 - now that's the proper way to do things
01:05 - so that's what we're going to want to do
01:06 - in Jango so in order to use these four
01:11 - or four messages you do this so from
01:14 - Jango HTTP import HTTP 404 art so let's
01:25 - go ahead and make it for that details
01:26 - view so the first thing I'm going to do
01:28 - in here is just make a details template
01:31 - so new HTML file I'll just name it a
01:35 - detail alright so we can get rid of this
01:41 - for now in our details template we won't
01:43 - worry about what exactly is inside there
01:45 - right now but we do know that we're
01:48 - going to want to not return this all
01:50 - right now instead of just returning some
01:52 - HTTP response without even checking if
01:55 - the ID is valid what we want to do is we
01:58 - want to try to query the database and we
02:00 - want to see if there's album with the ID
02:03 - that they typed in if there is then we
02:06 - can just go ahead and display this
02:07 - template but if there's not then instead
02:10 - of sending back a normal respond
02:12 - so we want to send back an HTTP 404
02:15 - response so what we do is we make a try
02:18 - accept statement and I'm just going to
02:21 - first go ahead and try to get their
02:23 - album ID so say album equals album
02:28 - objects and you remember how we get a
02:32 - specific album just one of them we
02:35 - either have to use PK or ID doesn't
02:37 - really matter and this is going to be
02:39 - equal to whatever ID they passed in so
02:43 - we're going to look for the album with
02:44 - the ID of one or two or seventy-four
02:48 - whatever now most of the time as long as
02:51 - the ID is valid then this is going to
02:53 - work perfectly however if they type
02:56 - something in like 700 and we can't get
03:00 - that item then what it's going to do is
03:02 - it's going to generate an album does not
03:04 - exist air
03:05 - so we'll say except album does not exist
03:11 - that means that hey arm that album you
03:15 - know maybe it was a typo maybe it got
03:17 - deleted or whatever but we don't have it
03:19 - in our database anymore so how do we
03:21 - handle this well to send back this 404
03:24 - response
03:24 - it's called raising not raisins it does
03:29 - sound kind of get the raisins HTTP 404
03:32 - and this is actually a function where
03:35 - you can pass in a message and then that
03:39 - message gets displayed um included in
03:41 - your 404 so I say album does not exist
03:47 - alright so hopefully they don't get that
03:50 - but you know they might who knows now
03:52 - another thing I want to do is just use
03:54 - this shortcut because that's a lot
03:57 - faster than you know what we learned
03:59 - before and I'll show you guys even a
04:01 - cooler way so you know how before what
04:05 - we did is we made this context which is
04:08 - basically information that your template
04:11 - needs to work and we set it equal to a
04:13 - dictionary well any time you have
04:15 - variable and you don't use it multiple
04:17 - times you see how we just use this one
04:19 - other time then what you can actually do
04:21 - is you can actually just take the value
04:23 - of it
04:24 - and use that instead so variables are
04:27 - just for whenever you have a value and
04:29 - use it over and over and over again in
04:31 - your program whenever you don't and you
04:34 - just use it once then you should
04:35 - probably just set equal to the value
04:36 - unless the values like something big
04:38 - like you're reading at a document or
04:41 - something so for this we're just going
04:44 - to throw in the album information and
04:47 - boom Russ that everything is good to go
04:49 - and actually this import right here HTTP
04:52 - response we aren't even using that for
04:54 - anything since we're just using render
04:57 - for everything so we can just delete
04:59 - that clean up our code even more and
05:01 - let's clean this up even more while
05:03 - we're here all right so look how
05:08 - condensed our code is yet we're learning
05:10 - more funny how things are alright so in
05:12 - our detailed view we probably should you
05:14 - know show something what are we going to
05:17 - show what is through this album so we'll
05:22 - just show the default view or the
05:24 - default string representation of that
05:26 - album and oops almost forgot this is the
05:30 - detail that HTML so this is the template
05:35 - that we're using for the detail view and
05:37 - all right let's so let's go ahead and
05:39 - refresh this make sure everything is
05:41 - up-to-date and check it out so whenever
05:44 - we go to this URL music slash one
05:47 - it displays red taylor swift skatepark
05:50 - slash myth and we can do this all day
05:53 - now if the user ever tries to do
05:56 - something stupid like go to 54 then it's
06:00 - going to say page not found and this is
06:02 - our 404 response now this is what I was
06:05 - talking about elbowing does not exist if
06:07 - you want to give them a little clear
06:09 - indicator of why they are getting this
06:12 - again this is optional but it's always a
06:14 - good idea to do so there you go noise
06:18 - made this is actually a pretty fun app
06:20 - if he asked me alright so so far we
06:23 - learned a bunch of stuff how to use
06:25 - templates for form messages but still
06:27 - there's a lot of crap to cover so yeah I
06:30 - think guys for watching don't forget to
06:31 - subscribe I will smell you guys next
06:33 - time
