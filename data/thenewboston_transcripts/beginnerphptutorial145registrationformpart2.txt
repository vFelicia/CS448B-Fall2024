00:00 - so the first thing to do is up here I'm
00:07 - just trying to think of we should it
00:08 - within this yeah we'll do it within this
00:09 - so if not logged in so the first thing
00:13 - to do is to check if each form field
00:17 - exists in our form so if everything's
00:20 - been correctly submitted and we use the
00:22 - is set function for this so if is set we
00:26 - can pull this down and it's going to
00:27 - look a bit better readability so if is
00:31 - set dollar underscore post username and
00:41 - is set dollar underscore post password
00:47 - and is set dollar underscore post
00:57 - pass one again and we go down the list
01:01 - and we just basically input and copy the
01:05 - code for everything so we've got first
01:07 - name and then we've got Sano so let's go
01:16 - and bring this up there and bring this
01:19 - up there so we're using this to check if
01:24 - each if each field has been submitted so
01:29 - we've got user name password password
01:30 - again used in puzzle first that's fine
01:33 - so now we open up to our block now what
01:37 - we need to do is check in fact we'll put
01:39 - this all on one line just so it's out
01:41 - the way okay so now what we need to do
01:46 - is we need to check if they're empty or
01:48 - not so let's come down again so it looks
01:50 - a bit neater so if not empty in fact
01:54 - what we'll do before this is we will
01:56 - create and the variables in themselves
01:59 - because we've already checked we're not
02:01 - going to we're not going to receive an
02:02 - undefined index error so now we can set
02:06 - them into their own variables because we
02:08 - know they exist
02:09 - so username equals dollar underscore
02:12 - post username password equals dollar
02:18 - underscore post password then we
02:24 - obviously have password again and that
02:27 - equals dollar underscore post and the
02:30 - field name is password again then we
02:33 - have a first name
02:35 - and that's equal to the Lance corpus
02:39 - name and the same with surname so we're
02:44 - finally at the last one you can probably
02:48 - see now why I didn't include a relevant
02:50 - data that wouldn't fit the suitability
02:53 - of the tutorial we're not going to go
02:54 - down and create loads of fields
02:55 - otherwise we'd be here for hours typing
02:57 - out things when I'm sure after this
02:59 - you'll be able to work out how to add
03:03 - your own fields so we've got the fields
03:06 - that we need and password again is
03:07 - something we're not going to be
03:08 - inserting into the database that's just
03:10 - going to be Froch
03:11 - inside here the first thing we want to
03:13 - do is check if all fields have been
03:15 - filled in because all fields are
03:17 - required so let's say if not empty user
03:23 - name and not empty password and not
03:31 - empty password again and not empty first
03:40 - name and last but not least not empty
03:45 - surname okay so now we can create a
03:48 - block to see if these are not empty to
03:50 - run if these are not empty I mean but
03:52 - otherwise we need to give a message to
03:54 - our user we need to say please fill or
03:58 - say all fields are required are equal
04:03 - wired okay so this is our error inside
04:08 - here we can echo okay for now just to
04:13 - see if everything exists if this okay
04:17 - does not echo and nor does this we all
04:22 - know will this will we know that we
04:24 - might have an error and we have inputted
04:26 - all data we know that we might have an
04:27 - error without naming or something like
04:29 - that so always check that if you if you
04:30 - receive an error so let's go ahead and
04:33 - click the button register button without
04:35 - typing any data in we get the message
04:38 - all fields are required let's just enter
04:40 - one all fields are required so let's
04:46 - fill them all out now
04:49 - [Music]
04:54 - one two three first-name Alex and then
04:57 - Garret let's click register and we've
05:01 - got the message up the top okay now
05:03 - you'll probably notice that the like
05:06 - let's say we were to enter our username
05:09 - our password and our first day but we
05:14 - were to exclude our surname and we click
05:16 - register we have this error up here but
05:19 - you've noticed that all the fields have
05:21 - now disappeared because we've
05:22 - resubmitted back to the page we are not
05:24 - keeping these values so what we do is is
05:27 - we take these values here and we input
05:31 - them into our our field and we do this
05:35 - using the value here so if I was to say
05:37 - value of username equals Alex you can
05:40 - see that when we refresh it says Alex so
05:43 - what we can do is what the data that's
05:45 - already submitted we can include within
05:47 - this form so if we open up PHP tags
05:49 - we're writing inline code now we can
05:52 - echo out the username so what will
05:56 - happen is though the page will be
05:57 - submitted this variable here will be set
06:00 - to Alex for example might be set to
06:03 - billy it might be set to anything but
06:05 - then we'll come down and even if we get
06:07 - this error we're still going to be
06:08 - putting this value in here so let's do
06:11 - that to all fields not the password
06:13 - fields because we don't them to remain
06:16 - so for the first name we want to open up
06:20 - PHP tags echo first-name and for the
06:25 - surname value equals PHP tags echo
06:30 - surname done so now we can return to our
06:35 - page I'm going to enter Alex I'm going
06:38 - to put my password in and I'm going to
06:44 - type in my first name now if we click
06:47 - register you can see that our username
06:50 - and our first-name stay and our surname
06:53 - is obviously blanks we didn't enter it
06:54 - in the first place but our passwords
06:55 - have gone this is just for security
06:57 - reasons you don't want to keep the
06:58 - password in there most websites don't so
07:00 - I don't recommend you do now if we click
07:02 - register we haven't entered the password
07:04 - so all fields are required again we've
07:06 - clicked register
07:07 - our information is staying we enter our
07:10 - information click register and it's okay
