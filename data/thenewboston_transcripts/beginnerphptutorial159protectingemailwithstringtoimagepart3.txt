00:00 - so let's go into our browser and click
00:02 - refresh and we shared yet there we go
00:04 - so now what we've got is an a textual
00:07 - representation or an image
00:09 - representation of our text by using
00:11 - these functions that I've already
00:12 - mentioned so really it's quite simple if
00:16 - you remember these functions remember
00:18 - what they do and also remember the
00:20 - parameters and in which order they go it
00:23 - hasn't taken me long to learn this you
00:26 - do forget after a while you have to sort
00:27 - of refer back to things but it's
00:29 - generally pretty simple and you get
00:30 - quite a neat output so this is quite
00:32 - cool
00:33 - we've got example at example.com like I
00:36 - said earlier in the tutorial I want this
00:38 - to be dynamic for example you could keep
00:40 - your generate PHP file on your website
00:43 - somewhere and refer back to it every
00:45 - time you wanted to convert say a public
00:46 - email address that's going to be
00:48 - displayed to an image so you want to
00:50 - make this stat the static variable that
00:54 - we've got here more dynamic so we want
00:56 - to take user input or input that's going
00:59 - to be processed through out our code
01:03 - eventually so what I'm going to do is
01:05 - modify this and change it to get email
01:10 - in fact probably the best thing to do
01:13 - would be to make this a bit more just a
01:17 - bit more flowing and working properly
01:20 - I'm going to say if is set dollar
01:23 - underscore get email then set that to
01:30 - then set that to email otherwise I want
01:34 - to say echo oh no so add I want to echo
01:37 - no no no I want to say email equals no
01:41 - email specified okay so what's going to
01:45 - happen now is we're going to check for
01:46 - this get variable and if so we're going
01:48 - to put it into the email variable that's
01:51 - going to be used by our program so we're
01:53 - now working with more dynamic input
01:56 - otherwise the email is just going to
01:59 - equal no email specified so let's go
02:01 - into my generator here again just hit
02:03 - refresh no email specified so now what I
02:06 - can do is I can specify the email here
02:08 - and I can say email equals exactly
02:11 - pull or set example up here to Pia
02:14 - Academy that all just so we've got a bit
02:16 - of change going on and you can see that
02:18 - that email address is now written out so
02:21 - let's try putting some long value in it
02:25 - so let's just say example a Peoria
02:27 - chemita org again but we'll copy and
02:29 - paste this over and over again just so
02:32 - we can see how the length of this image
02:34 - changes now let's say we were to just
02:38 - specify a width for ourselves we could
02:41 - I'm going to cut this so I can use it
02:43 - again later let's take a 20 for example
02:46 - now let's go into our generate file and
02:48 - you can see that it's only just giving
02:50 - us a bit of this a bit of this image so
02:55 - we're using this function we're not
02:57 - we're not we're not creating any code
03:00 - for the sake of it we're doing this so
03:01 - everything is dynamically updated and we
03:04 - don't lose out on any data and also this
03:06 - this also means I'm sorry this also
03:10 - means that we what we're doing is we're
03:11 - not wasting any data I mean we could say
03:14 - well the image width could be a thousand
03:17 - you know pixels long or ten thousand
03:20 - pixels long or something but we're only
03:21 - creating it here the size we actually
03:25 - need it was so is saving up on
03:26 - processing time and we're saving up on
03:29 - space as well or rather memory so now
03:34 - what we need to do is work out how we're
03:36 - going to put this into a form now the
03:39 - problem here is like I said up here I
03:41 - could say yeah I'm going to write email
03:43 - and what should happen now is it should
03:46 - say email it should break down a line
03:48 - and then it should output this image
03:50 - when in actual fact when we refresh the
03:52 - page we get all of this gobbledygook
03:54 - come up cannot modify header information
03:56 - headers already sent in this page and
03:59 - then we get the literal um sort of
04:02 - textual you know representation of the
04:05 - JPEG as if you were to open it up in a
04:07 - text editor so this looks a massive mess
04:10 - at the moment and we also can't put
04:13 - output within our code so I could say
04:16 - well after the header then we
04:19 - can say email and then a break but if
04:21 - you refresh you see that nothing comes
04:24 - up now because you ruined the content of
04:26 - your page this content type is
04:28 - image/jpeg it's nothing else no texts
04:31 - nothing
04:31 - we're just outputting an image and
04:33 - that's here so how do we go about doing
04:35 - this because the image now exists as a
04:38 - PHP file if you look in here where we're
04:42 - essentially dealing with what's a
04:43 - dynamic JPEG we've got generate PHP and
04:46 - we've got a an argument after he'll or
04:48 - an input variable after here so how are
04:51 - we going to insert this what we've got
04:54 - here let me just highlight it and icon
04:56 - so what we're going to do to put this
04:58 - email address inside a natural image on
05:01 - our page because we can't use this at
05:03 - the moment as it is well that's where
05:05 - index dot PHP come comes in like I
05:07 - mentioned earlier I'm going to set up a
05:09 - a profile page if you like with exactly
05:13 - how I do it normally set what I wouldn't
05:16 - do it normally like this but let's say
05:17 - we've got a name and that equals some
05:21 - dynamic value so it could be Alex then
05:25 - we'll break down a couple more times and
05:27 - we'll say email or break down now what
05:30 - we want to do is we want to output this
05:31 - image from generate PHP in here so how
05:35 - we're going to go about doing that well
05:36 - we're going to create an image like we
05:38 - would in also not double equals an image
05:42 - like we normally would in HTML and we'd
05:44 - normally say something like image jpg
05:48 - here or email jpg or something but what
05:53 - we can actually do that you might not
05:55 - already know is we can insert the
05:57 - contents of a file in here and because
05:59 - generate PHP is being processed as an
06:02 - image type it will actually pick up
06:04 - inside image source as an image itself
06:07 - so what we can do is we can say generate
06:09 - dot PHP and what that's going to do now
06:12 - obviously we haven't specified an image
06:14 - so this part of our code is going to
06:16 - take action so let's go ahead and
06:19 - refresh the page the index page this
06:21 - time not the generate dot PHP page so
06:24 - index dot PHP
06:26 - you can see that we've got name Alex and
06:28 - an email no email specified so now
06:31 - inside image source we can now start pre
06:34 - defining post or using get variables so
06:38 - I'm now going to say email equals Alex
06:41 - or example at example.com and we can
06:48 - refresh and you can see now we're on our
06:50 - index page everything's fine but we now
06:53 - just have a graphical representation of
06:55 - an email address now just a few notes
06:59 - the whole purpose of this tutorial was
07:02 - being able to create some text as an
07:05 - image in order to maintain some level of
07:08 - security on the website so this email
07:10 - address cannot be obtained now let's go
07:12 - ahead and look at the page source and
07:14 - you'll see that we've got this image
07:16 - source equals generator PHP email equals
07:19 - example example com now the Lizer
07:23 - problem in in our method because it's
07:26 - flawed what we actually have now is a
07:29 - text representation of our email address
07:33 - still existing in our code now there's a
07:35 - couple of ways that you can solve this
07:37 - and I'm not going to do it I'm just
07:39 - going to talk about it briefly if you've
07:42 - dealt with databases and retrieving
07:44 - values from databases what we could do
07:46 - is we could say email equals and we
07:48 - could maybe supply a user ID here
07:50 - instead now that user ID might
07:53 - correspond to a value in a database in
07:55 - which it an email address is stored in
07:59 - fact let's go ahead and quickly make an
08:01 - example and we're going to need to
08:02 - connect to our database but if you've
08:04 - already look at--look to that you should
08:05 - be comfortable with this
