00:00 - so today right now solve word problems
00:04 - using polynomials so most people find
00:09 - that the hardest part about word
00:11 - problems is setting up your equations
00:14 - because if you don't set up your
00:16 - equations correctly you won't get the
00:19 - right answer to the word problem so
00:23 - we're just gonna do some examples and
00:26 - focus a lot on setting up the equations
00:30 - because solving them is usually pretty
00:32 - easy so Sally has 21 coins and nickels
00:36 - and dimes the total is one dollar and
00:39 - seventy-five cents how many of each does
00:42 - she have so we know that her total
00:47 - amount and I'm gonna use in cents just
00:50 - because it's easier it's a hundred and
00:53 - seventy five so we know that we're going
00:55 - to be setting something equal to 175 so
01:04 - when we talked about doing the word
01:07 - problems earlier on in the series I
01:11 - always told you that you have to name
01:12 - your variables so that's what we're
01:14 - gonna do right now
01:16 - so it doesn't really matter what you
01:18 - call X you just have to make sure you
01:21 - clarify what it is so for this one I'm
01:23 - gonna let X be a number of nickels and
01:29 - then since I have 21 points total if I
01:36 - take 21 and subtract the number of
01:38 - nickels from it I'm going to get the
01:41 - number of dimes so the next thing that
01:51 - we have to remember is that this total
01:55 - is the total sentence not the total
02:01 - amount of coins so that means that we
02:05 - have to multiply the number of nickels
02:09 - by how much in nickel is worth
02:13 - the number of Dimes by how much a dime
02:15 - is worth so since a nickel is equal to
02:19 - five cents 5x + and a dime is worth 10
02:26 - 21 minus X is equal to our total number
02:32 - in cents one hundred and seventy five
02:35 - cents so now we're going to distribute
02:38 - this ten and you get to ten - ten X is
02:46 - equal to 175 so we're going to combine
02:50 - this positive 5x and this negative 10x
02:53 - and we get negative 5x and I'm gonna
02:56 - subtract this 210 over and you get
03:01 - negative 35 if you divide both sides by
03:05 - negative five to get the X by itself you
03:07 - get X is equal to negative 35 divided by
03:12 - negative five is gonna be a positive
03:15 - seven okay now when we do word problems
03:21 - we always have to make sure that we
03:23 - answer the question completely so this
03:26 - question asks how many of each does she
03:30 - have so remember we got X is equal to
03:33 - seven and seven is the number of nickels
03:36 - or X is the number of nickels so she has
03:40 - seven nickels and 21 minus X is the
03:45 - number of Dimes Tsarina plug in our X 29
03:49 - 21 minus seven is 14 so she has seven
03:54 - nickels and 14 x and you can always
03:57 - check your work by making sure that 7
04:01 - times 5 plus 14 times 10 really does
04:07 - equal 175 so 7 times 5 is 35 + 140 times
04:12 - 14 times 10 which is 140 and that you'd
04:19 - get 175 and since 175 does equal 175 you
04:24 - know that your answer is correct
04:27 - so we're gonna do one more example and
04:30 - it's kind of similar to the one we just
04:33 - did so Tim bought stamps for 25 cents
04:37 - and 29 cents
04:38 - he paid 7.65 cents for 28 stamps how
04:45 - many of each stamp did he buy so again
04:50 - our total is gonna be 7 $60 and I'm
04:59 - gonna convert it to cents just because I
05:02 - think it's easier to work in cents
05:06 - because each stamp has a value that's
05:13 - expressed in cents so you have to make
05:16 - sure that if you were to do this in
05:18 - dollars that you show this as a portion
05:24 - of a dollar so we have to name our
05:27 - variables again so I'm just gonna have X
05:30 - be equal to the number of 25 cent stamps
05:38 - and then since he bought 28 stamps 28
05:44 - minus X is gonna be the number of 29
05:48 - cent stamps so just like we did with the
05:56 - last problem we have to multiply each
05:59 - one of these equations or each one of
06:03 - these variables by how much each stamp
06:06 - cost so we have 25 cent stamps which
06:12 - cost 25 cents so 25 X plus 29 times 28
06:21 - minus X is equal to 760 and this is
06:27 - gonna be a really big number so I'm
06:29 - gonna have to use a calculator 29
06:32 - times 28 is equal to 812 - 29 X is equal
06:41 - to 76 and I combine our like terms a
06:44 - positive 25 X - or adding it to 29 X is
06:51 - gonna give us a negative 4x and if I
06:54 - subtract this 812 over you're gonna get
06:59 - negative 4x is equal to a negative 52
07:03 - cents you divide both sides by 4 you're
07:06 - going to get X is equal to 13 so again
07:12 - just like the last one we have to make
07:14 - sure we answer the question completely
07:16 - so the question wants to know how many
07:18 - of each did he buy so X is the number of
07:22 - 25 cent stamps so he bought 13 25 cent
07:29 - stamps and 28 minus X is the number of
07:35 - 29 cent stamps so 28 minus 13 is equal
07:41 - to 15 so in he bought 15 29 cents cent
07:49 - stamps and you can always check your
07:52 - work by plugging these two numbers in to
07:55 - this equation that you wrote right here
07:58 - so that's all we're gonna do with word
08:01 - problems today make sure you come back
08:03 - and check out our next lesson where
08:06 - we're gonna start learning about
08:08 - factoring and how it can help us solve
08:11 - equations
