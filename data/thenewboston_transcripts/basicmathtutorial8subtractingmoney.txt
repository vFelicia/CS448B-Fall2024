00:00 - welcome to subtraction with money you
00:03 - have 89 cents you have to figure out
00:05 - what kind of corns you have to make up
00:07 - 89 cents so so you have three quarters
00:11 - that'd be 75 cents so you subtract the
00:15 - 75 cents so 9 minus 5 is 4 and the 8
00:22 - minus 7 is 1 so you have 14 cents left
00:26 - so you can either use two nickels or one
00:29 - dime so say you just either/or two
00:32 - nickels or one dime so let's count it
00:35 - down three quarters let's say two
00:38 - nickels two nickels is 10 cents bring
00:45 - down the poor so you have four cents
00:47 - left so you can have nothing left but
00:49 - four pennies so you can make 89 cents by
00:55 - having three quarters two nickels four
00:57 - pennies or let's say you can either
01:01 - convert this to one dime or you can
01:06 - revert this to seven dimes and one
01:13 - nickel so altogether you can have eight
01:16 - dimes one nickel and four pennies
01:21 - another option if you didn't have any
01:23 - quarters let's go to a different example
01:27 - 93 cents so you have the 93 cents and
01:35 - say how to use all nickels all you had
01:37 - was nickels and pennies so how many
01:40 - nickels make up 90 cents so you know
01:46 - five and five is ten so thinking
01:52 - critically if you had if you want to
01:56 - have 90 that would be nine tens so that
02:00 - would be nine dimes and you'd times that
02:06 - by to 18
02:12 - so 18 nickels would make up 90 cents
02:23 - bring down three and all you have left
02:26 - is three pennies so 18 nickels and three
02:32 - pennies or you can do nine dimes in
02:37 - three pennies or say you had some
02:42 - quarters 75 cents get to carry over make
02:51 - that in a 13 that's 8 and 8 minus 7 is
03:00 - 18 so you have 18 cents left so you can
03:06 - use one dime that's three quarters so
03:11 - one dime is ten cents and then you let's
03:18 - bring this up here so yeah one dime and
03:24 - you subtract five cents is three one
03:29 - nickel and then three pennies remaining
03:32 - there is another option
03:40 - 26 cents so you're 26 cents and you can
03:50 - have one quarter and one penny you can
04:01 - have two dimes so just 20 cents one
04:09 - nickel and one penny that's two dimes
04:15 - one nickel and one penny or five times
04:28 - five is twenty five so five nickels and
04:36 - one penny so many possibilities sure
04:43 - another one sixty eight cents say you
04:46 - want to use this little coins you
04:48 - possibly can so you'd use your quarters
04:50 - first or if you have a half dollar you
04:52 - can use a half dollar so let's say you
04:54 - have one half dollar one H team that's
05:00 - 50 Cent's 8 - zeroes 8 + 6 minus 5 is 1
05:10 - and you have 18 cents left so you can do
05:15 - one dime just 10 cents one nickel oops
05:24 - that's not a plus sign one nickel
05:31 - and one penny
05:43 - so you have 32 cents you can't use a
05:49 - half-dollar so you have to use a quarter
05:54 - borrow one from the 3 negative to make
05:57 - that 12 and that's seven two minus two
06:02 - is zero so that's one quarter and you
06:08 - have one nickel and then two pennies
06:23 - and that's all I have with subtraction
06:25 - for money
