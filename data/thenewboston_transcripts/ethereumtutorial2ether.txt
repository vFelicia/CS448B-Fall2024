00:00 - all right y'all welcome back to another
00:02 - tutorial and in this one we're going to
00:04 - be talking about ether
00:06 - so where to start how about what the
00:08 - heck is ether great question
00:11 - so ethereum's unit of currency is called
00:15 - you guessed it ether
00:17 - and you need ether to do pretty much
00:20 - anything on the network aside from some
00:22 - very basic things like you can read data
00:24 - from the network for free but let's just
00:26 - say that you need ether to do anything
00:28 - interesting on the ethereum network
00:31 - so let's go ahead and start with the
00:32 - most simple use case and that is
00:35 - whenever one user has some ether and
00:38 - they just want to transfer it to another
00:40 - user
00:41 - so say that this user just got done
00:43 - watching the new boston tutorial on
00:45 - ethereum
00:46 - and they thought it was pretty cool
00:48 - decided to buy let's see one two three
00:49 - four ether right here
00:51 - so they told their friend about it and
00:53 - their friend thought it was pretty cool
00:54 - too so this person decided to transfer
00:57 - to ether to someone else's account maybe
01:00 - their friend their moms their brother
01:01 - sister whoever so what they can do is
01:04 - issue a command to the ethereum network
01:06 - and say hey i want to take to my ether
01:08 - and send them to someone else another
01:10 - account
01:11 - so the ethereum network can do that and
01:14 - after this it would update their balance
01:16 - from four to two and it'll update the
01:18 - recipients from let's say they had zero
01:21 - before so zero to two
01:23 - all right so
01:24 - in this way it's it's basically just
01:26 - acting as a transfer money or in other
01:29 - words you can view ether as a standard
01:31 - unit of currency now i do want to
01:33 - mention that even in the simple
01:35 - transfers of ether it is going to
01:38 - require the user to pay a fee in ether
01:42 - and that is because
01:43 - even though it's uh you know pretty
01:45 - simple math just saying you know deduct
01:47 - some ether from this account and add it
01:48 - to this account
01:49 - what this user is essentially doing is
01:52 - instructing the ethereum network
01:54 - to do some amount of work and all of
01:56 - these computers all of these node
01:58 - maintainers they just don't want to you
02:00 - know spin up their servers and do
02:01 - everything for free so the ethereum
02:04 - network does require a small fee even
02:06 - for these simple transactions now
02:08 - another thing that i want to mention
02:10 - real quick is that you'll often hear
02:12 - people saying things like hey send me
02:14 - five ethereum or hey i'm going to send
02:17 - you three ethereum now ethereum is
02:20 - technically the name of the network
02:23 - so this isn't correct terminology
02:25 - although you know i'm guilty of uh using
02:28 - incorrect terminology a lot however in
02:31 - this case i do want to point out that
02:33 - what they actually mean is hey send me
02:35 - five ether or i'm gonna send you five
02:38 - ether
02:38 - so ethereum is the name of the overall
02:41 - network and ether is the unit of
02:44 - currency used by ethereum now aside from
02:48 - just simple transactions of ether from
02:50 - one person to another ether is also
02:53 - needed for dapps
02:55 - developers they need ether to actually
02:57 - create
02:58 - these smart contracts and
03:00 - pretty much issue them or deploy them to
03:02 - the network and another thing is that
03:05 - ether is also needed to execute these
03:08 - smart contracts or run them whenever
03:10 - they are on the network
03:12 - and i know we didn't cover that process
03:15 - of deploying or executing smart
03:16 - contracts yet but just keep in mind for
03:18 - now that ether is needed for dapps
03:22 - now another interesting note is that
03:24 - ether can be further divided into
03:26 - smaller units called whey
03:29 - now one ether is actually equal to one
03:32 - quintillion way
03:35 - so
03:35 - this diagram is not exactly accurate for
03:39 - purposes of not wanting my computer to
03:41 - explode i decided it was best to not
03:44 - render one quintillion
03:46 - one quintillion way on here but just
03:49 - remember that one ether is equal to one
03:52 - quintillion way and that is 10 to the
03:55 - 18th
03:56 - and wei is indeed the most
03:59 - base or in other words the most atomic
04:02 - unit of ether so you can't split up a
04:04 - way now if you are interested in
04:07 - developing smart contracts you're
04:09 - actually going to be working with whey
04:10 - quite a bit
04:12 - and
04:13 - just to make it easier in everyone's
04:14 - head there are a lot of tools out there
04:17 - to convert way to ether so say that you
04:21 - wanted to i don't know maybe make a
04:23 - smart contract that was distributing
04:25 - like uh to ether to someone now if you
04:28 - wanted to convert that to whey instead
04:29 - of you know having a piece of paper or
04:31 - calculator there are actually a lot of
04:33 - different converters online if you just
04:35 - type in ether to weight converter
04:37 - there's going to be a ton that pop up
04:39 - but let's say
04:40 - you type in two ether right here then
04:42 - it's gonna do all the conversions
04:44 - and you can see that this is two
04:46 - quintillion way
04:49 - now there are also a lot of different
04:50 - units in between there but the most
04:53 - common ones are just ether and way to be
04:57 - honest no one really uses these other
05:00 - units that often gray is one that's i
05:03 - see sometimes use but really if you just
05:06 - know whey in ether then you're gonna be
05:08 - fine now the last thing that i want to
05:10 - touch on in this video is how is ether
05:14 - created or in other words where does it
05:15 - come from
05:17 - so whenever new ether is created it's
05:20 - distributed to the nodes in exchange for
05:23 - their help in participating and securing
05:26 - the network however when new ether is
05:28 - created it is not just split up and
05:31 - distributed evenly to all nodes the new
05:34 - ether is distributed to one node at a
05:37 - time through a process called mining
05:40 - and i'm sure you heard of this before
05:41 - but we are going to review mining in
05:44 - more detail in the upcoming course for
05:46 - right now i just want to give you a very
05:48 - high level overview to really just focus
05:50 - on the core concept of ether and mention
05:52 - that that is how it gets created or
05:54 - minted into the network so for now i
05:57 - think that covers everything that we
05:58 - need to discuss about ether for the time
06:00 - being so thank you guys for watching
06:02 - don't forget to subscribe and i will see
06:03 - you later
