00:00 - what is going on guys is Bucky and
00:01 - welcome to your fortieth tutorial and in
00:03 - this tutorial I'm going to show you guys
00:05 - probably the most simple example I've
00:08 - ever showed you and that is basic form
00:11 - validation now what this program is
00:13 - going to do is we're going to have a
00:15 - really simple form it's probably going
00:17 - to be one check box and whenever we
00:19 - click the submit button it's going to
00:21 - check whether or not that check box is
00:23 - checked so you're saying all right this
00:26 - is how you do validation with check
00:27 - boxes but I want to do validation with
00:30 - username and passwords well once you
00:32 - understand the basics behind form
00:34 - validation
00:34 - you can apply this to every single
00:36 - element so you don't have to learn a
00:38 - bunch of different ways you have to
00:40 - understand this one tutorial and then
00:42 - you understand the basics of foreign
00:44 - validation so like I said let's go ahead
00:46 - and start out with a basic form and I'm
00:49 - going to name mine arm buckey's form and
00:53 - let's go ahead and end it right now
00:55 - and like I said we can have a bunch of
00:58 - different elements in here but for the
01:00 - sake of this tutorial I'm just going to
01:01 - add one check box so input type equals
01:05 - check box and might as well give it a
01:09 - name it will make it easier just name it
01:11 - the box this is the Box tonton done and
01:15 - now we need some kind of submit button
01:18 - because whenever we're calling our
01:20 - function later on and we needed some way
01:23 - to submit the form that's basically a
01:25 - lemn sign so input type equals button
01:30 - and might as well give it a value of
01:32 - something like press me that's the text
01:36 - that's going to appear on the button and
01:37 - now let's go ahead and use our on click
01:40 - attribute and remember whatever code we
01:42 - type in here like validator this is the
01:46 - JavaScript function that's going to be
01:48 - called whenever we click our bun so
01:50 - let's go ahead and save this and run and
01:52 - launch and Chrome what we got now so
01:54 - whenever we click our button nothing
01:55 - happens because we didn't type any
01:57 - JavaScript yet but whenever we create
02:00 - our validator function
02:02 - we're going to create our Valerie
02:04 - function to check whether or not this
02:06 - checkbox is checked so right now it
02:09 - doesn't do anything but we're going to
02:10 - change that right now so I'm going to go
02:12 - ahead and since this is just a function
02:14 - I'm going to go ahead and add in the
02:16 - head of my website why not I like that
02:19 - all my functions there so again this is
02:21 - named validator so that's what we need
02:23 - to call our function function and
02:25 - actually might as well just copy that to
02:27 - ensure that we don't have any typos and
02:30 - it's going to take no parameters and
02:32 - check it out whenever we call our
02:35 - function we need to check whether or not
02:37 - our check box is checked or not and we
02:40 - can do that with a basic if else
02:42 - statement
02:42 - so if and the condition we want to test
02:45 - is is this check box check so first we
02:48 - need access to that check box in order
02:50 - to do that document dot the name of your
02:53 - form which is Bucky's form and let me
02:56 - just double click that make sure whoa
02:58 - not Bucky's forum buckey's form there we
03:02 - go
03:02 - that's why I double click it make sure
03:04 - they both float up so Bucky's form and
03:06 - now we need to access the element the
03:09 - check box and we gave it a name the box
03:12 - so we can easily access it and the
03:15 - property to see if it's checked or not
03:17 - is checked now this is going to be true
03:20 - if it's checked and false if it's not
03:22 - checked so let me go ahead and launch in
03:26 - Chrome see right now it would be true
03:29 - since it's checked and right now it
03:31 - would be false since it's not checked so
03:33 - if it is checked
03:34 - what bit of code do we want to run well
03:36 - let's just go ahead and make an alert
03:38 - box pop up on the screen that says you
03:40 - know something stupid like
03:42 - yep it's checked with explanation boy
03:46 - and now if it's not checked it's going
03:49 - to be false so under our else let's just
03:51 - go ahead and alert on something even
03:54 - dumber like you better check that Hoss
03:58 - and I like that because they both start
04:03 - with y and that's just right no it's not
04:07 - checked explanation point so save this
04:10 - in let me run this and then I'll talk
04:12 - you guys through it one more time
04:13 - launching Chrome so let's go ahead and
04:15 - check it and press it and it says yes
04:18 - it's checked cool enough now let's go
04:20 - ahead and uncheck it press it again and
04:22 - it says no it's not checked okay pretty
04:26 - cool it's working perfectly so basically
04:28 - here is what we did we went ahead and we
04:31 - created a forum called Bucky's forum and
04:33 - we added a checkbox to it and whenever
04:36 - we click the button
04:37 - we told JavaScript to call this
04:39 - validator function well then we went
04:42 - ahead and we made the validator function
04:44 - and all this function did is it said all
04:46 - right whenever you click this button I'm
04:48 - going to check if the checkbox is
04:50 - checked if it is I'm going to run this
04:52 - bit of code if it's not I'm going to run
04:54 - this bit of code so that's why whenever
04:56 - you ran it and it was checked it says
04:58 - yes it's checked and whenever it was
05:00 - unchecked it said no it's not checked
05:02 - pretty cool huh
05:03 - so that is the basics of form validation
05:07 - again we only have one other element
05:09 - besides the button on this form but what
05:12 - people typically do is they make a
05:14 - function to validate all their data and
05:17 - again like you see we validated one
05:20 - piece of data right here but then you
05:23 - might have another piece of code that
05:25 - says validate another checkbox or
05:27 - validate a text box or a password field
05:30 - so with that being said this is how we
05:33 - use a bunch of different excuse me this
05:36 - is the basics of form validation and how
05:39 - to create a function to validate all the
05:42 - data in your form so that's all I have
05:44 - for you guys in this story again pretty
05:46 - clear and simple the basics of form
05:49 - validation you pretty much make your
05:51 - form
05:52 - use a function to validate the data by
05:55 - accessing each element in the form
05:57 - simple enough so now that I covered that
06:00 - I don't know what I'm covering in the
06:02 - next tutorial but trust me is going to
06:04 - be amazing so thank you guys for
06:06 - watching don't forget to I don't know
06:08 - don't forget to brush your teeth I'll
06:11 - see in the next story
