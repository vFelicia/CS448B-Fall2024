00:00 - all right guys welcome back to your 25th
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
00:05 - I'm going to teach you guys how to
00:06 - create your own objects so like I said
00:09 - before an object is pretty much a
00:11 - special type of data that has its own
00:14 - properties and its own methods and today
00:17 - we're going to be creating an object
00:18 - that has a couple properties with it we
00:20 - won't be talking about methods now but
00:22 - maybe in the future tutorial or
00:24 - definitely in future tutorial we will so
00:26 - basically there are a couple different
00:28 - ways that we can make our own own
00:30 - objects one of the ways and probably the
00:32 - easiest way is to use something called a
00:35 - Constructor function and like I said
00:37 - before an object is pretty pretty much a
00:40 - blueprint so that's what we're going to
00:42 - be doing in this tutorial so in order to
00:45 - make our own object what people
00:47 - typically do is whenever they're making
00:49 - this blueprint they go ahead and take
00:51 - the script and they stick it in the head
00:53 - so let's go ahead and do that put your
00:55 - script tags in the head and whenever
00:57 - we're printing stuff out we try to do
00:59 - that in the body so for now since we're
01:01 - not printing anything out let's just go
01:03 - ahead and stick this in the head so in
01:05 - order to create this special thing
01:07 - called a Constructor function it looks
01:10 - basically just like any other function
01:12 - go ahead and tape the name function just
01:14 - like that and we're going to be making a
01:16 - blueprint or AKA object for people so go
01:21 - ahead and name it like person or people
01:23 - or whatever you want so we have an
01:26 - object called person now let's go ahead
01:29 - and let
02:30 - right we want to work with this current
02:31 - object you need to give it a special
02:34 - keyword called this I know it's weird
02:37 - but this is what you have to do and this
02:39 - basically means is we're working with
02:42 - the current object why it would ever
02:44 - work with another another object I don't
02:46 - know but trust me it's stupid I
02:49 - understand but it's what you have to do
02:50 - so this current object's name is
02:54 - whatever name we pass in there so it's
02:56 - going to take like Bucky Roberts and
02:58 - it's going to assign it to the object's
03:00 - name this is pretty much saying this
03:02 - whatever information we pass in and
03:05 - whatever information we want to assign
03:06 - to the object that's all it does
03:09 - really so now we have to do it with age
03:12 - this object's age is going to be equal
03:14 - to whatever the age we tell it to pass
03:16 - in simple enough so I saying all right
03:20 - this is basically called a Constructor
03:23 - function and it's basically a blueprint
03:26 - for a function so now we have the
03:28 - blueprints right here
03:30 - but we really don't have an object yet
03:32 - all we have is the instructions telling
03:34 - us how to make one so let's go ahead and
03:36 - make a couple objects right now in order
03:38 - to make a new object and by the way let
03:41 - me just tell you guys this I say make a
03:44 - new object but if you're taking a test
03:47 - uh for college or something it's
03:48 - actually called creating a new instance
03:51 - of an object so I say it like you know
03:54 - the straightup way but the technical
03:56 - term put on your quiz create a new
03:58 - instance of an object so you know say
04:01 - that and your teacher will probably you
04:03 - know I don't know want to say get a hard
04:05 - on or something so in order to create a
04:07 - new object is just like creating a new
04:09 - variable variable and then you list the
04:12 - name of your object I'm going to create
04:14 - a Bucky object so in order to do that go
04:17 - ahead and set it equal to this whenever
04:21 - you create a new instance AKA whenever
04:24 - you create an object you have to use the
04:26 - keyword new this is telling JavaScript
04:29 - we're about to create a new object so
04:32 - after this we write what blueprint do we
04:35 - want to use well since we're going to be
04:37 - creating a new Bucky object and we only
04:40 - have one blueprint obviously it's going
04:42 - to be the person blueprint so it says
04:46 - all right since you're using that person
04:48 - blueprint it takes two pieces of
04:50 - information the first thing that I need
04:52 - is the name and the second thing I need
04:54 - is the age okay let's go ahead and give
04:57 - that to you name Bucky Roberts age 24
05:03 - and make sure remember any strings have
05:06 - to be in quotation marks in any numbers
05:08 - don't have to be so that is basically
05:10 - how you create a new object your
05:12 - object's name what blueprint you want to
05:14 - use in any information it needs so let's
05:17 - go ahead and create another one real
05:18 - quick um VAR let's make one for Taylor
05:22 - St since she is cute uh new of course
05:26 - she's a person too but her name
05:31 - whoa Taylor Swift and I don't know her
05:35 - age but I'm going to guess like 20 or
05:37 - something I don't know who knows either
05:40 - she was 20 or she is going to be 20 at
05:41 - one point so good enough so now we have
05:44 - two objects a Bucky object and a Taylor
05:47 - object Bucky object now has two
05:49 - properties its
05:51 - name is Bucky Roberts and its age is
05:57 - 24 oh I got like kennel Cofer something
06:00 - and then we have a tailor object the
06:03 - tailor object's
06:04 - name is Taylor Swift and the tailor
06:08 - objects age is 20 so that's pretty cool
06:12 - we have a blueprint right here and we
06:15 - actually created the objects down here
06:17 - but why is this useful well can we print
06:19 - it out or something oh yes we can so
06:22 - remember like I said anytime you want to
06:24 - print something out you should do so in
06:26 - the body so let's go ahead and print out
06:29 - this stuff right now
06:32 - document WR so anytime just like before
06:36 - in the last tutorial I told you guys you
06:38 - want to use an object's properties you
06:41 - need to list the name of the object and
06:43 - let's go ahead we have two objects to
06:45 - choose from Bucky and Taylor let's go
06:47 - ahead and print out my name first so
06:49 - list the name of your object Bucky and
06:51 - then using a DOT separator you list the
06:54 - name of its property or variables so
06:57 - Bucky's name should print out out Bucky
07:01 - Roberts pretty cool huh so let's go
07:04 - ahead and see another example if we
07:05 - wanted to print out um Taylor Swifts Age
07:08 - We to write the object
07:11 - Taylor and the property we want to
07:13 - access is age so let's go ahead and save
07:15 - this and it should print out 20 just
07:18 - like that so like I said this is just a
07:21 - better way of organizing data instead of
07:24 - going you know calling a function or
07:27 - anything like that to access Tyler so H
07:30 - the only thing we need to do now is just
07:32 - the name of the object and what property
07:35 - we want to access so Buy's name Bucky's
07:38 - age Taylor tr's name Taylor tr's age
07:40 - it's a whole lot easier than creating a
07:42 - bunch of functions to display all that
07:44 - information so again to recap one last
07:47 - time in order to create the blueprint
07:50 - for an object you pretty much do
07:52 - something called create a Constructor
07:54 - function and that is the technical name
07:56 - and in order to do that you write what
07:58 - type of object do you want to be making
08:02 - and then list the information that it
08:04 - needs and then say all right with that
08:06 - information that we're going to pass in
08:08 - we want to assign it to that
08:10 - object so Bucky's name is going to be
08:13 - Bucky Roberts Taylor's age is going to
08:15 - be 20 and then now that we have a
08:18 - blueprint we can go ahead and make as
08:20 - many objects as we want I made two in
08:23 - this example but we can either make 5 10
08:26 - 5,000 if we want it doesn't matter and
08:29 - after that whenever you want to use any
08:31 - information from an object you go ahead
08:32 - and write the object's
08:34 - name and the variable or the properties
08:37 - associated with it and again don't
08:40 - forget if you're watching this tutorial
08:42 - because your teacher confused you in
08:44 - JavaScript class or something like that
08:46 - whenever you're creating objects I say
08:49 - creating objects but the technical term
08:51 - is creating an instance of an object and
08:55 - the technical term for this is called a
08:57 - Constructor function so there there you
08:59 - go there's your answers for your test
09:02 - and uh that's the basics of how to
09:04 - create our very own objects so this is
09:07 - one way we can create objects another
09:09 - way I'm going to be teaching you that in
09:12 - maybe couple tutorials maybe the next
09:14 - tutorial I haven't decided yet but for
09:15 - now that's all you get so thank you guys
09:17 - for watching uh don't forget to

09:20 - website and I will see you guys later
