00:00 - so let's just run through this to make
00:01 - sure you understand we've got a public
00:04 - function constructs we've got a
00:05 - constructor here which is reading in
00:07 - some arguments from when we initiate our
00:11 - class then what we're doing is we're
00:13 - checking to see if this Connect function
00:15 - returns a true value and we haven't done
00:17 - anything with the connect method sorry
00:19 - yet but when we do if it returns a false
00:23 - value we're going to say connection
00:24 - failed otherwise if it returns a a true
00:27 - value we're going to say connected to DB
00:29 - host so what we could say is again we
00:31 - could say if this connect DB host DB
00:40 - username DB password so if this equals
00:45 - true basically because we don't have
00:47 - this exclamation mark here as our not
00:50 - saying is it not true so let's just test
00:54 - this out let's return true automatically
00:58 - in this connect function so when we cool
01:01 - the connect function or the connect
01:03 - method here and here we're automatically
01:06 - returning true so therefore we're going
01:09 - to say connected to and it's going to
01:11 - successfully work so at the moment if we
01:13 - refresh our page you'll see that there's
01:14 - nothing on there because we need to
01:16 - create a new instance of this connect
01:17 - this database Connect class so
01:21 - connection equals database connect and
01:25 - remember we need to supply it with three
01:27 - arguments which is the host
01:31 - the username and the password so this
01:35 - actually at the moment isn't using the
01:37 - MySQL connect function to see if it's
01:39 - worked on our we're just supplying
01:40 - through three arguments and then we
01:44 - automatically going to return connected
01:46 - to local host because we're
01:48 - automatically returning true on this
01:51 - connect method so let's refresh you can
01:53 - see oh no database connect oh sorry okay
02:00 - so I've put connection equals database
02:01 - connect we need connection equals new
02:03 - database Connect because now what PHP
02:05 - thinks I'm doing here is it thinks I'm
02:09 - calling a function when in fact is not a
02:11 - function it's a class or an object so
02:14 - let's refresh connected to localhost
02:16 - okay that's fine
02:17 - we presume that would happen because
02:18 - we've automatically returned true here
02:20 - now let's try to automatically return
02:22 - false to see what happens and you can
02:26 - see that it says connection failed so we
02:27 - know that everything is working up until
02:29 - now now all we need to do is inside our
02:32 - public function connect we need to let's
02:34 - just get rid of that inside our method
02:37 - connect I mean we need to do a MySQL
02:40 - connect
02:41 - and we need to check if this has
02:43 - connected and then we can return a
02:44 - specific value so we just say if MySQL
02:48 - Connect will put not in there so if the
02:53 - connection is false or if it hasn't
02:55 - worked and we're supplying remember
02:57 - database host from the arguments up here
02:59 - database username again from the
03:03 - argument here and then also DB password
03:07 - so if that hasn't worked bear in mind we
03:09 - already we automatically connect to our
03:12 - database because we supply this command
03:13 - but this if statement is checking if
03:15 - it's not connected properly then we
03:17 - return false so hopefully now you can
03:20 - see it start coming together else
03:25 - returned true okay so what we're doing
03:29 - now is we're connecting to our database
03:31 - if it hasn't worked we're returning
03:32 - folks back to this construct here where
03:35 - we've made our check and otherwise we're
03:38 - returning true back to not the construct
03:40 - but the check in here where we're using
03:42 - this connect
03:43 - so now let's double check that and let's
03:46 - refresh our page to see if we don't have
03:48 - any errors okay everything looks okay
03:50 - let's create a new instance of our
03:53 - connect and this will either work or not
03:56 - so we can say connect equals database
04:01 - connect and then we can put our
04:05 - arguments in here now just before that
04:07 - in this construct just above the if I'm
04:10 - going to say echo attempting connection
04:16 - okay so I'm writing attempting
04:18 - connection and then what will either get
04:20 - is connection failed or connected to our
04:22 - server so a database connect we need to
04:29 - specify the host which is for me
04:31 - localhost the username which is root for
04:35 - me and I don't have a password set but
04:37 - let's just let's just get rid of that
04:41 - for now and refresh and see what happens
04:44 - again I've done the same thing and I
04:47 - haven't used my new keyword in there
04:49 - let's refresh and you can see we've got
04:51 - a tempting connection and then
04:52 - connection failed so now let's try with
04:54 - the correct credentials I'll type my
04:56 - username in there so this will
04:58 - successfully connect to my database so
05:01 - let's check if it works okay and it says
05:03 - connected to localhost so with what
05:05 - we've learnt already and with using this
05:07 - constructor here we've automatically
05:09 - taken in some arguments from when we
05:12 - create a new instance of our class we've
05:15 - read these in and we've used a function
05:17 - called connect which has allowed us to
05:19 - connect to our database now why is this
05:22 - useful why might this be useful in a
05:24 - real life situation because it's just
05:27 - simply an easier and tidier way to
05:29 - connect to your database and return
05:31 - errors you can see that here we've got a
05:33 - really neat way to show that we've
05:35 - connected to our database we don't
05:37 - always need to tell our users that we've
05:38 - connected to our database but let's say
05:40 - for debugging purposes you wrote all
05:42 - your code like this you're going to have
05:44 - detailed error information sent straight
05:46 - back to you without just using a
05:48 - procedural code where you will maybe say
05:51 - or die kill the page here we get
05:54 - specific information and all we need to
05:56 - do is say connection equals new database
05:58 - connect and we're basically done
