00:00 - okay so now what we're doing is we're
00:01 - we're checking for a connection to our
00:03 - um MySQL server then we're checking for
00:06 - our database so just for now I'm going
00:09 - to Echo out okay so let's go back and
00:13 - check if this is
00:15 - working I'm going to just start typing
00:17 - something in here and you can see that
00:18 - okay is displayed so that's absolutely
00:20 - fine we are connecting to our database
00:23 - and our um our server and our database
00:27 - correctly so now what we need to think
00:29 - about is the query that we're going to
00:30 - perform on our table so let's just go in
00:34 - go go in here and I'll explain a bit
00:36 - about the query we're going to be using
00:38 - the like keyword which is inside uh our
00:42 - SQL uh query and like is going to take
00:46 - is going to use um a percentage sign to
00:50 - say do we want to check if it's like
00:52 - from the left and the right hand side so
00:55 - it could be let's say we could type A
00:57 - into the search text now Alex Garrett
01:00 - has an A in Dale Garrett has a couple of
01:02 - A's in Billy Garrett has an A in Craig
01:05 - Malcolm has an A in and so do all the
01:07 - other records so therefore these would
01:09 - all be returned now let me just show you
01:11 - what that looks
01:12 - like that looks like
01:14 - like and then a so in other words uh
01:19 - search text so if search
01:23 - text equals a our query is going to look
01:26 - a bit like this obviously there's going
01:28 - to be more to the query because we we're
01:30 - creating a full query um but we would
01:33 - retrieve all results because all results
01:35 - have an A somewhere in it if we were to
01:38 - do this this means search text from the
01:41 - start and then anything afterwards so
01:43 - what we're doing now is oh we don't want
01:45 - to save that what we're doing now is is
01:48 - we're searching uh for
01:50 - a and then we could say a l e so we're
01:54 - searching Al e than anything
01:56 - else oh I don't want to save that again
01:59 - so um so yeah this is the way we're
02:01 - going to do it we're not going to use a
02:02 - percentage sign at the end of each one
02:05 - um but we are going to use one at the
02:08 - end to correctly display our search
02:10 - results because we don't want to be
02:11 - searching you know with keywords inside
02:14 - of of our words if that makes sense if
02:16 - not you'll uh understand a bit later and
02:18 - there is another tutorial on this that
02:19 - I've created so you can go and have a
02:21 - look at the like um the like keyword so
02:24 - let's start creating our query let's go
02:26 - ahead straight start creating it I'm
02:28 - going to say select
02:30 - and what do I want to select from the
02:31 - database I want to select the name so if
02:34 - we go into our database we've got the
02:35 - name here so I want to select the name
02:38 - and we're selecting from and the table
02:40 - is names so let's go back into our
02:43 - database and have a look at that we've
02:44 - got names there um and then what we're
02:47 - doing is we're saying
02:49 - where name
02:51 - oh where
02:53 - name like remember I said now usually
02:57 - you do this if you want this if you want
02:58 - to search for a key keyword inside here
03:02 - but what we're doing is we're just
03:03 - saying
03:04 - like and we're specifying the search
03:08 - text and then the uh percentage sign
03:11 - afterwards so we're searching for
03:12 - anything in the front uh well we're
03:14 - searching for a specific in the front so
03:16 - Al would produce Alex Garrett and Alex
03:19 - Malcolm um and then anything after that
03:22 - otherwise it would just be an exact
03:24 - match so we uh create this as a wild
03:27 - card it's called a wild card so we need
03:29 - to think about Security in here as well
03:31 - so Let's Escape that there um and Rec
03:34 - concatenate that on there and we need to
03:38 - oh no sorry let's get rid of that and
03:40 - put that back in there okay so now what
03:42 - we need to do is we need to say MySQL
03:45 - real
03:47 - Escape string I do have some videos on
03:50 - SQL injection that you should have a
03:51 - look at if you don't understand what
03:53 - this function does it basically protects
03:55 - protects against SQL injection um by
03:59 - escaping certain characters inside of
04:01 - this string uh now we can actually run
04:03 - the query so query run equals MySQL
04:06 - Query and we've just simply run that
04:08 - query so now what we can do is we well
04:11 - what we need to do is we need to return
04:13 - a list of all names retrieved from this
04:16 - statement so if I type A there will be
04:19 - let's go and count there'll be one two
04:22 - there'll be two names retrieved cuz if
04:24 - we start with an a anything after that
04:27 - um is a wild card so we've got a for
04:30 - Alex Garrett and a for Alex Malcolm if
04:32 - we type Al e x for example these two
04:35 - will still be returned if we type Al X
04:37 - space g then only this record will be
04:40 - returned because we're matching this
04:42 - part and the rest of it is a wild card
04:44 - so hopefully now that makes sense if you
04:46 - didn't understand before so we need to
04:48 - use a wall loop as we've done in some of
04:51 - my previous tutorials we've looked at um
04:53 - creating an array from our query from
04:57 - the results so I'm going to say while
04:59 - query
05:00 - equals MySQL
05:03 - fetch associative now what this function
05:05 - here is going to do is fetch an
05:07 - associative array from the uh Records
05:10 - that we've returned from this query and
05:12 - we specify the query inside of it just
05:14 - like that so now what we can do is we
05:16 - can access each element of The Returned
05:19 - results so I can say just print out the
05:21 - name uh obviously we're not selecting
05:23 - the ID from the uh table here so we're
05:26 - just going to have access to this name
05:28 - so let's Echo out name equals so we're
05:32 - just basically setting the variable
05:33 - called name here so name equals query
05:37 - row remember we've set the array as this
05:40 - variable here so we're using Square
05:42 - parenthesis as an array and then we can
05:45 - just type in name there because it's an
05:47 - associative array so this value here of
05:49 - name will match our field in there so
05:52 - hopefully that makes sense as well and
05:54 - we're going to append a break on it cuz
05:55 - we want it to look nice when we uh
05:57 - displaying it as the user is typing
05:59 - otherwise they're all going to be in
06:00 - line okay so that's about it let's go
06:03 - back to our page and uh
06:06 - refresh so I'm going to start typing a
06:08 - character I'm going to type
06:10 - a hopefully I actually get something
06:15 - back no
06:18 - odd let's go back and have a look at
06:20 - what we might have done wrong okay yeah
06:23 - we're not actually outputting anything
06:24 - that would help um so yeah I've I've
06:27 - I've assigned um the value of the name
06:28 - from the data based to this variable
06:30 - name and we can simply stick echo in
06:32 - front of that and that will just display
06:33 - it out to us
