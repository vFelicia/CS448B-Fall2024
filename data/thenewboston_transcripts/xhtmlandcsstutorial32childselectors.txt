00:00 - why hello there but I could say my name
00:02 - is bucket and welcome to your
00:05 - thirty-second XHTML and CSS tutorial I
00:08 - hope you guys enjoyed my British accent
00:10 - I know I did but anyways in this
00:12 - tutorial I'm gonna be talking to you
00:13 - guys about how to style a child selector
00:17 - now let me give you guys a quick
00:20 - overview of what I mean by child first
00:22 - of all I'm not talking about a child
00:25 - selector like you decided that you and
00:28 - your wife want to adopt a baby so now
00:30 - you have to select a child that's not
00:32 - what I'm talking about
00:33 - not in this tutorial at least maybe I'll
00:35 - do that in the next tutorial I don't let
00:36 - me just my microphone there that's
00:39 - better so anyways a child in terms of
00:43 - XHTML is a tag that's inside another tag
00:46 - so for example you see how whenever we
00:50 - make tags like body they have to be
00:52 - within the HTML tags or whenever we have
00:55 - the style tags they have to be within
00:57 - the head tags we can't have head style
00:59 - head style they have to be inside one
01:02 - another so the relationship I'm talking
01:04 - about is this see this head the head is
01:07 - a child of HTML so HTML would be the
01:11 - parent and since head is inside it would
01:14 - be the child body is also a child of
01:17 - HTML since body is inside HTML style is
01:22 - a child of head since style is inside
01:25 - head so you can say style is the child
01:28 - head is the parent there now you guys
01:31 - should understand what I mean by a child
01:33 - and a parent now with that being said
01:36 - I'm gonna show you guys how to style a
01:39 - child selector for example if you come
01:43 - across this problem
01:44 - I want a style links but I only want to
01:48 - style the ones inside paragraphs well we
01:52 - can't just go ahead and make a style for
01:54 - links because that's going to apply it
01:56 - to all of them in order to say alright
01:58 - we want to apply it only to the ones
02:01 - that are in paragraphs we need to do
02:02 - something something special so let's go
02:05 - ahead and first and foremost make three
02:07 - different links right here just go ahead
02:08 - and put like a href equals
02:12 - HTTP the new boston.com and now let's go
02:17 - ahead and just write it like first or
02:19 - something like that so first of all
02:20 - we're just gonna have a regular link on
02:22 - the screen
02:23 - that's a refresh this make sure it works
02:25 - and when we click it it takes us to the
02:27 - greatest website ever that New Boston
02:29 - com
02:30 - so anyways let's go ahead and make two
02:32 - more so first and foremost we have a
02:34 - regular link on the screen nothing
02:37 - special
02:37 - so now let's go ahead and make a
02:39 - paragraph PP oh man I crack myself up
02:46 - and now let's go ahead and put this link
02:48 - inside PP enter alright second I am so
02:52 - immature is ridiculous these are the
02:55 - most unprofessional tutorial so you have
02:57 - ever seen in your life probably but hey
02:59 - they're pretty good so and last let's go
03:02 - ahead and put another one in a header so
03:05 - now you're saying re I have these three
03:08 - links and I want oh yeah God probably do
03:11 - this third so first second and third so
03:13 - here's what they look like the first one
03:15 - is just a regular plain old text the
03:17 - second one is inside a paragraph and the
03:20 - third one is inside the header so right
03:22 - now they all look the same and you're
03:24 - saying alright I want a style only the
03:28 - links that are inside paragraph tag so I
03:30 - want to style basically only these so in
03:34 - order to do that like I said we can't
03:36 - just go ahead and style all the links or
03:38 - else it's gonna style all of them what
03:39 - we need to do is say this alright first
03:42 - of all inside the paragraph tags I want
03:46 - to style all the links now let me you
03:50 - know kind of put this in another terms
03:51 - you're saying re a it's pretty much all
03:56 - right all children a with the parent of
03:59 - P or basically all link tags inside
04:03 - paragraphs I'm going to go ahead and
04:06 - style those and you use this with the
04:08 - greater than sign so greater than sign
04:10 - pretty much means relationship whenever
04:14 - a make a link has a parent of P aka
04:17 - paragraph I want to style you so now
04:20 - let's go ahead and apply some styles
04:22 - let's go ahead and put color red and
04:24 - maybe put like font size 30 pixels not
04:30 - that it's a lowercase
04:32 - Oh embarrassing so let me go ahead and
04:35 - add this last semicolon refresh and see
04:37 - what we got
04:38 - check it out now CSS went through look
04:42 - for all the links now we're inside the
04:44 - paragraph is this link inside a
04:45 - paragraph nope is this link inside a
04:48 - paragraph yep so I'm gonna style this
04:49 - one is this link inside a paragraph no
04:52 - it's inside a header so don't touch that
04:54 - one either and it go ahead or excuse me
04:57 - you know went ahead and applied the
04:59 - style to those links so that is not only
05:03 - how you talk in terms of relationships
05:05 - child parents but also how you can style
05:09 - pretty much not only a link but
05:11 - basically anything you want depending on
05:14 - what it parent what their parent is and
05:16 - another quick bit of information I
05:19 - wanted you guys you guys are probably
05:20 - saying alright
05:21 - if head is the child of HTML then does
05:26 - that mean style is the grandchild of
05:29 - HTML yes it does in technical terms
05:32 - that's how it works so um HTML is the
05:35 - grandparent of style took us um
05:38 - grandchild child parent or grandparent
05:42 - grandchild depending on what you're
05:45 - referencing you know that has nothing
05:47 - new this tutorial but you know I got a
05:49 - couple extra minutes might as well give
