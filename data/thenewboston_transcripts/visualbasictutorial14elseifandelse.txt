00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - covering the else if and else statement
00:10 - so the last tutorial we covered the if
00:12 - statement now let's go ahead and get
00:15 - started we're going to start off by
00:19 - using console dot write line and we'll
00:24 - just type what is your name and now
00:30 - we're going to create a variable called
00:32 - username and we're going to store the
00:35 - information that the user types in as
00:37 - user name so we'll declare username so
00:40 - dim user name as string and we'll set it
00:44 - equal to console dot read line so now
00:50 - what we want to do is we want to ask
00:51 - them for the password so we'll just type
00:55 - console dot write line what is your
01:01 - password and will declare the password
01:06 - so dim password as string as equal to
01:10 - console dot readline ok so now what we
01:15 - want to do is we want to create an if
01:17 - statement to see if they typed in a name
01:19 - that is in let's say a list of possible
01:24 - names that can be logged in so if
01:29 - username equals Sam or if not Sam say
01:36 - not same same then do something
01:40 - so if username is equal to Sam then
01:43 - we'll do console dot write line
01:50 - welcome Sam now we want to cover any
01:56 - other cases that could happen now I
01:57 - could do this with a bunch of if
02:00 - statements that's not very efficient we
02:02 - can use what's called an else--if
02:04 - statement so we just do this by typing
02:07 - else if username equals Tim so if
02:14 - username equals Tim then we want to do
02:17 - something so we'll just type console dot
02:21 - write line welcome Tim
02:31 - so basically basically what we've done
02:34 - is if username is equal to Sam then go
02:37 - ahead and say welcome Sam but if
02:39 - username is equal to Tim then say
02:41 - welcome Tim and this is all in one if
02:43 - statement by using else if in case
02:46 - somebody else tries to login and we
02:48 - don't know who they are we're just going
02:50 - to tell them that they have typed in an
02:52 - invalid name now to do this we're going
02:55 - to type else so else they can go ahead
03:00 - and do the code that is inside in
03:02 - between else and then div so what else
03:04 - does is it covers anything else that you
03:06 - did not cover so if username equals Sam
03:08 - they're just going to go ahead and do
03:09 - this but else say if username equals Tim
03:12 - it'll do this and if username equals
03:14 - anything else other than Sam or Tim then
03:17 - go ahead and do whatever we type inside
03:20 - here so we'll just type console dot
03:22 - write line you are not a valid user and
03:31 - then after our end if we'll just do
03:34 - console dot read line so that so that
03:38 - the user has time to see if they've been
03:41 - accepted or see if they type in the
03:43 - right name so if we do what is your name
03:45 - and I type in Sam you'll say what is
03:49 - your password I'll just type in the New
03:52 - Boston it'll say welcome Sam and then it
03:56 - won't say anything else after that
03:57 - because we haven't added anything that
03:59 - will handle the password so now if we
04:03 - run that again it'll say what is your
04:05 - name I'll type in Tim or let's see
04:10 - this is case-sensitive so Tim and say
04:14 - what is your password type in a bunch of
04:16 - stuff right there it says welcome Tim
04:18 - now if we type in anything else other
04:21 - than Sam or Tim it's going to say you
04:24 - are not a valid user so we can do the
04:28 - same thing with our password so if
04:35 - password equals the new Boston
04:43 - then go ahead and let the user know that
04:46 - they have been granted access so we'll
04:50 - just type console dot write line and
04:58 - we'll say congrats and then we'll just
05:05 - add their username so congrats username
05:09 - and then we'll say you have been granted
05:18 - access
05:22 - now this isn't very secure but it's just
05:25 - for the sake of this tutorial let's say
05:28 - instead of you are not a valid user
05:31 - let's just say I don't know who you are
05:34 - so that way the person doesn't have to
05:36 - have the right username but if they have
05:38 - the let's say the administrator password
05:40 - then they can go ahead and login so I
05:44 - don't know who you are so if we go ahead
05:47 - and run this say what is your name let's
05:50 - just say Sam what is your password type
05:54 - the New Boston it'll say welcome Sam
05:57 - congratulations Sam you have been
05:59 - granted access now what we need to do is
06:04 - add a space right here so that Sam isn't
06:07 - right next to that so now if we type an
06:12 - invalid username it'll say let's just do
06:16 - this and if we type in the New Boston
06:18 - you see that will get the output I don't
06:22 - know who you are and I'll say congrats a
06:23 - da FA you have been granted access so go
06:30 - ahead and practice some else if
06:31 - statements and some else statements get
06:33 - familiar with that and then once you
06:35 - have that nailed down go ahead and move
06:37 - on to the next tutorial
