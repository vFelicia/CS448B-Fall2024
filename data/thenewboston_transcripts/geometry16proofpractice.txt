00:01 - okay so today we're going to do some
00:03 - more proofs and I know we've been doing
00:06 - a lot of these but every time we do a
00:08 - new lesson on proofs we're learning
00:11 - more rules that help us prove
00:16 - things so example number one given that
00:21 - t l is isoceles and te is equal to e l
00:27 - prove that te EA is congruent to Le
00:32 - EA so first we'll write down our given
00:36 - information t a l is
00:44 - isoceles t e equal e
00:50 - l
00:51 - okay so the first thing we can
00:55 - do is since we're told that t l is
00:58 - isoceles
01:00 - that
01:02 - means this has to be equal to
01:06 - this so ta a is congruent to a
01:12 - l if triangle is
01:19 - ises
01:21 - then
01:23 - sides are
01:25 - congruent because a is the vertex angle
01:29 - of the isoceles triangle so that means
01:33 - Ta A and A L have to be
01:36 - congruent so now we're going to learn
01:40 - something
01:41 - new we are told that te is equal to e l
01:46 - but to prove triangles are congruent we
01:48 - need two congruent sides
01:52 - but the definition of congruent is
01:55 - segments who have equal measures so
01:58 - we're going to use this little theorem
02:00 - to get te congruent to eel and the
02:04 - theorem is if equal
02:10 - measures
02:12 - then congruent because congruent means
02:15 - to have equal
02:17 - measures so now we have one side and
02:21 - another side all we need is a third side
02:24 - but if you look these two triangles
02:27 - share
02:28 - AE and since AE is always going to be
02:32 - congruent to AE we have a third pair of
02:35 - congruent sides so this is our reflexive
02:44 - property and we have one last step which
02:47 - is to say therefore triangle te EA is
02:52 - congruent to Triangle l e a by side side
02:58 - side so so our next problem is going to
03:02 - deal with this shape trying to prove
03:05 - it's a parallelogram so given that AB is
03:09 - parallel to
03:11 - DC and angle one is congruent to angle
03:16 - 4 prove AB c d is a
03:22 - parallelogram okay so let's write our
03:24 - given information so AB parallel to DC
03:30 - angle one congruent to angle
03:34 - four
03:37 - okay so if you notice since these two
03:41 - lines are
03:42 - [Music]
03:44 - parallel that
03:46 - means that angle two is congruent to
03:50 - angle three because they're alternate
03:52 - interior angles so angle two is
03:55 - congruent to angle
03:57 - three if line are
04:01 - parallel alternate interior angles are
04:08 - congruent okay so we just got this angle
04:13 - congruent to this angle we have another
04:16 - pair of congruent angles and if you
04:19 - look they share this side because if we
04:24 - can get these two triangles congruent we
04:27 - can get this pair of opposite sides also
04:29 - congruent and that proves it's a
04:31 - parallelogram so we can say DB is
04:34 - congruent to
04:38 - DB and that's the
04:42 - reflexive
04:46 - property and then we can say that the
04:49 - triangles are congruent by angle side
04:54 - angle so triangle DB a is congruent to
05:00 - triangle
05:04 - B
05:06 - oh yeah b d
05:09 - c by angle side
05:13 - angle and
05:15 - then we can get DC congruent to
05:20 - AB DC is congruent to
05:24 - AB cuz if triangles congruent
05:28 - corresponding
05:31 - parts are also congruent and then
05:34 - finally we can say that a b c d is a
05:40 - parallelogram because
05:43 - if one pair of opposite
05:48 - sides are parallel and congruent then it
05:53 - is a
05:55 - parallelogram so those are the only
05:58 - proofs we're going to work with today
06:00 - but make sure you come back and watch
06:03 - the next lesson where do some review of
06:06 - area and regular polygons
