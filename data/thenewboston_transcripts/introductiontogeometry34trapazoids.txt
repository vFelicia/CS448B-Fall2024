00:00 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:03 - trapezoids
00:05 - and the trapezoid is a quadrilateral
00:09 - which just means that it has four sides
00:13 - so it's a quadrilateral with exactly one
00:17 - pair of parallel sides
00:20 - right here and right here
00:22 - and these pair of parallel sides are
00:25 - called the bases
00:26 - so this is base one and this is base two
00:31 - and exactly two pairs of consecutive
00:34 - angles that are supplementary
00:37 - so one and two
00:40 - are supplementary
00:44 - and
00:46 - three and four
00:48 - are supplementary
00:51 - but one and three and two and four are
00:54 - not supplementary
00:57 - so like i said that the bases
00:59 - the parallel sides are called the bases
01:02 - and the non-parallel sides are called
01:05 - legs so these two right here are legs
01:09 - and in an isoscele
01:12 - trapezoid
01:13 - these legs
01:15 - are congruent
01:17 - but that's only in an isosceles
01:19 - trapezoid
01:22 - so we have tropid trapezoid a b c d
01:27 - name the bases so like we said the bases
01:30 - are the parallel sides
01:33 - so these two sides are parallel
01:37 - so that means that c d
01:41 - and a b
01:42 - are the bases of this trapezoid
01:45 - if the measure of angle b equals 90
01:48 - degrees
01:50 - what is the measure of angle c well we
01:54 - said that
01:55 - these two
02:00 - we said that there
02:01 - can only be two
02:03 - pairs of congruent
02:06 - or
02:07 - sorry there can only be two pairs of
02:10 - supplementary angles
02:12 - so for this particular triangle
02:15 - these two
02:18 - and these two are supplementary
02:22 - so to solve x we get we set x
02:25 - plus
02:27 - 90 equals 180. if you subtract the 90
02:30 - over you get x equals 90.
02:34 - if d is a hundred and two
02:39 - what's the measure of a
02:45 - so y
02:47 - plus
02:48 - a 102
02:51 - equals 180
02:54 - subtract that over and you get 98.
03:02 - sorry you get 78.
03:06 - so
03:07 - if ad is equal to 5
03:10 - cb has to equal
03:13 - well
03:14 - this is an isosceles trapezoid
03:17 - because the legs are congruent
03:21 - so if the legs are congruent that means
03:23 - they have equal length so if 80 equals 5
03:26 - then cb
03:28 - also has to equal 5.
03:31 - if the measure
03:34 - so
03:35 - if the measure of angle d
03:38 - equals the measure of angle c
03:42 - and the measure so that means that these
03:44 - two angles are congruent
03:47 - and the measure of angle a is
03:50 - 45 degrees
03:52 - what's the measure of angle
03:57 - what's the measure of angle c
04:01 - so we know these two are congruent
04:05 - and
04:08 - these two angles
04:11 - have to be supplementary
04:14 - so we're going to call this
04:15 - we're just going to call this d
04:18 - so d plus 45 equals 180
04:22 - so you subtract that 45 over you get d
04:25 - equals 130
04:27 - so that means c also equal
04:30 - 135 degrees
04:32 - if the measure of
04:34 - the measure of angle a plus the measure
04:36 - of angle who equals 80.
04:39 - well we did we just did that right here
04:41 - so the measure of angle d
04:44 - dc is parallel
04:47 - to this line right underneath it
04:50 - a b because these two lines will never
04:52 - intersect
04:59 - so now we have true or false
05:02 - so there exists a trapezoid with three
05:06 - congruent sides
05:09 - well
05:11 - say we have this trapezoid
05:15 - we're just going to call this trapezoid
05:17 - f
05:18 - and it's an isosceles trapezoid
05:21 - so these two
05:24 - sides are the same length
05:27 - well
05:28 - all
05:30 - four sides couldn't be the same length
05:33 - because then it would be a square not a
05:35 - trapezoid
05:37 - but this side could
05:39 - equal the length of
05:41 - of the legs and it'd still be a
05:44 - trapezoid
05:45 - so that is true
05:48 - the bases
05:49 - of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent
05:53 - well we just answered that it's the legs
05:57 - that are congruent so that is false
06:02 - so
06:04 - that's all we have on trapezoids but
06:07 - make sure you come watch the next lesson
06:09 - where we're going to talk about
06:11 - midpoints and the median of a trapezoid
