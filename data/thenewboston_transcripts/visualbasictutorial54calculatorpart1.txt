00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the New Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial and in the next
00:07 - upcoming tutorials we're going to be
00:10 - creating a calculator so let's go ahead
00:13 - and get started by making a new project
00:17 - we'll select windows forms application
00:19 - and we will just call it calculator and
00:25 - we'll wait for that to load now let's go
00:30 - ahead and add some stuff to our form so
00:34 - we'll open up our toolbox we will add
00:37 - three text boxes and for the third text
00:43 - box we are going to set read-only equal
00:46 - to true so read-only is now equal to
00:49 - true and we'll go ahead and set the
00:52 - names for these so the first one is
00:54 - going to be text num1 the second one is
00:59 - going to be text num2 and the third one
01:04 - is going to be text numb three or text
01:06 - answer now let's go ahead and add some
01:11 - buttons here so we'll just add them
01:13 - below and we will make this a little bit
01:16 - bigger okay so here's our add button
01:23 - will add a subtract will add a power
01:33 - what else can we have we'll add multiply
01:35 - will add division and we'll just add PI
01:40 - so now that we've got some buttons and
01:43 - some text boxes let's go ahead and
01:45 - rearrange these and make it look a
01:46 - little bit nicer
01:47 - so we'll strength these down and you can
01:52 - see here that lines show up whenever we
01:53 - want to shrink them down and this is
01:55 - what Visual Basic does to help you make
01:57 - your forms and controls look a little
01:59 - bit nicer so let's go ahead and set the
02:04 - name of this one to button add we'll hit
02:08 - enter with we will have button
02:12 - subtract button divide button multiply
02:28 - instead of power for this one let's just
02:30 - do button modulus and for this one we
02:36 - will do button pie so now let's go ahead
02:41 - and set the text value for each of these
02:43 - so the first one is just going to be ad
02:48 - this one will be subtract and this one
02:56 - will be divide multiply modulus and pie
03:11 - so now let's add some labels so the user
03:13 - knows what these boxes are for so we
03:17 - will just select all of these and drag
03:20 - them down some will drag this down and
03:23 - this down with it will open up our tool
03:30 - box we'll add a label and we'll have
03:35 - this label say first number we'll copy
03:44 - this and paste it and we'll set the
03:48 - second one to second number
03:55 - and we'll set the third one to answer
04:04 - so we'll just ctrl-c and ctrl-v to paste
04:07 - it
04:17 - so for this one we'll just type answer
04:23 - okay so now I'll just create click
04:25 - events for each one of these now if you
04:35 - don't want to double click on each one
04:36 - of the buttons you can go ahead and
04:38 - select the button and click the
04:39 - lightning bolt and find the click of it
04:41 - and double click on that so now that
04:44 - you've got your forum initialized and
04:46 - you know what it looks like you can you
04:48 - don't have to make it look exactly like
04:49 - mine but um go ahead and once you've
04:52 - made that move on to the next tutorial
04:54 - and will start putting in the code for
04:56 - this
