00:00 - what's up guys welcome to your 73rd C++
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial you will
00:05 - be happy to know we are covering the
00:08 - last string functions so after this uh
00:11 - tutorial no more string functions for a
00:13 - while so I bet you guys are glad about
00:16 - that so the first thing I'm going to be
00:17 - covering is the string erase function
00:20 - now what this function does it it erases
00:23 - everything from and including whatever
00:26 - element you tell it to so let's go ahead
00:28 - and string I'm just going to make a
00:30 - string called string one and I'll write
00:33 - something like hi my name is Bucky and I
00:39 - love bacon and ham something stupid like
00:42 - that and why not explanation point you
00:44 - know spice things up a bit so let's go
00:46 - ahead and first just print this out on
00:48 - the screen so we have something to
00:49 - compare it to after we change it later
00:51 - on so now what I want to do is I want to
00:55 - let's say I want to erase let's
00:58 - see I want to erase everything from the
01:01 - 20th character on so it's going to be
01:04 - like somewhere around here and say this
01:06 - is the 20th character right here I want
01:08 - to erase everything from here till the
01:10 - end of the string well we need to use
01:12 - something called The Erase function and
01:15 - it's probably already in there right
01:16 - there erase and it takes one parameter
01:19 - what character do you want to begin
01:21 - erasing that erasing it and remember it
01:24 - includes the 20th character as well so
01:27 - it doesn't start at 21 it actually
01:28 - erases the 20th character character as
01:30 - well so now let's go ahead and print out
01:33 - the new and improved erased string and
01:36 - we'll go ahead and run it and see what
01:37 - it looks like so the original string is
01:39 - hi my name is Bucky and I love bacon and
01:41 - ham and the new string is hi my name is
01:44 - Bucky and it erased everything from here
01:46 - on out so that's all the erase function
01:49 - does so now um aside from the erase
01:52 - function I guess we can go ahead and
01:54 - keep this and this and this the only
01:56 - line of code that's going to change in
01:57 - this tutorial is this so now that we
02:01 - know what the erase function does I want
02:02 - to talk to you guys about another
02:03 - function and that's the replace function
02:06 - so press
02:08 - S1
02:09 - replace functions already filling in for
02:11 - me all right the replace function takes
02:15 - three parameters the first parameter it
02:17 - takes is what character do you want to
02:21 - begin replacing it and Bucky I already
02:24 - know is the 14th character since this
02:26 - was the 20th character right here so
02:28 - this B is the four
02:30 - index the next parameter so let's go
02:32 - ahead and put 14 in there right now
02:34 - before I forget the next parameter it
02:36 - takes is how many characters do you want
02:39 - to replace so let's count 1 2 3 4 5
02:44 - Bucky is five characters long so we want
02:46 - to if we want to erase this entire thing
02:48 - or in other words replace it we're going
02:50 - to start at the 14th character and
02:52 - replace five characters so that's going
02:55 - to replace the entire word buy so the
02:58 - third parameter it takes is what do you
03:00 - want to replace it with so now that we
03:02 - have Bucky replaced I think it would be
03:04 - only appropriate to you know add a new
03:07 - name like um I was just going to add it
03:10 - right there that'd be way too easy like
03:13 - Samuel Jackson and I spelled that wrong
03:16 - but it doesn't really matter so you
03:17 - don't have to replace it with the same
03:19 - number of characters you're pretty much
03:20 - saying all right what do you want to
03:22 - replace and what do you want to replace
03:24 - it with so if we go ahead and run this
03:25 - we can see that the original string was
03:28 - hi my name is Bucky and IA bacon and ham
03:31 - and now the new string took Bucky out
03:33 - and added Samuel Jackson so it says hi
03:35 - my name is Samuel Jackson I love bacon
03:38 - and ham and he probably does so what
03:41 - replace does is basically takes a
03:44 - certain bit out of the string and
03:46 - replaces it with something else easy
03:49 - enough so now I want to talk to you guys
03:51 - about one last string function and
03:54 - that's insert now what insert does is it
03:57 - inserts a substring into the string but
03:59 - it doesn't take anything out like it did
04:01 - Bucky before so if we wanted to change
04:04 - the string to hi my name is lucky Bucky
04:07 - and I love bacon and ham we don't want
04:08 - to take anything out we just want to
04:10 - insert something right after is so what
04:13 - we do is put S1 that's string we're
04:15 - working with the function is called
04:17 - insert right like that and it takes two
04:20 - parameters the first parameter it takes
04:22 - is where do you want to begin inserting
04:25 - it well we already know 14 is the
04:27 - beginning of Bucky and the next
04:29 - parameter it takes is what string do you
04:32 - want to put right there what substring
04:35 - do you want to add into the main string
04:37 - and just go ahead and press lucky and
04:39 - we'll add a space after lucky so it
04:41 - would be lucky space Bucky if we didn't
04:43 - add this space it'll be like lucky Bucky
04:45 - one big word but I want my name is lucky
04:48 - Bucky so I'm going to begin at index
04:50 - number four and I want to insert the
04:52 - word lucky with a space after it so
04:55 - don't forget your semicolon and whenever
04:57 - you run this you can see the original
04:59 - string hi my name is Bucky and now we
05:01 - inserted lucky so the new string is hi
05:04 - my name is lucky Bucky and I love bacon
05:06 - and ham so that is how you insert words
05:10 - you know into a string and one other
05:12 - thing I forgot to mention let's see if I
05:14 - can go ahead and
05:16 - uh ZZ replace just like that usually
05:20 - people use replace whenever they they
05:23 - usually use it in conjunction with find
05:25 - so remember in the last tutorial I told
05:27 - you about find how you can find like all
05:29 - the am in a string I think that was the
05:31 - example I showed you guys people
05:33 - typically Loop through your entire
05:36 - document and find all instances of
05:38 - something and use this replace function
05:40 - to replace it with this for example
05:43 - here's a great example if you ever use
05:45 - Microsoft Word and it saw that you know
05:48 - you did your whole homework assignment
05:50 - and you saw you spelled the word
05:52 - dictionary with a K and you typed it
05:55 - like 18 times well whenever you right
05:57 - click it and spell check it it says
05:59 - replace all this is how they made it it
06:02 - just Loops through finds all the time
06:05 - you take dictionary with the word K and
06:07 - replaces it with a proper spelling of
06:09 - dictionary which of course doesn't have
06:11 - a K in it so if you're ever wondering
06:13 - how Microsoft uh coded that find and
06:16 - replace these are the methods they use
06:18 - to do it so if you think you
06:20 - know uh you know Microsoft is a bunch of
06:23 - Genius programmers and they program in
06:26 - ways that you can never even learn well
06:28 - that's one of the techniques we already
06:30 - learned it we just you know learned the
06:32 - concept of it instead of applying it in
06:33 - a main program but all they did is they
06:35 - used find they Loop through your entire
06:38 - document found all the instances and
06:40 - each time they found it they called this
06:41 - replace and replaced it with a proper
06:43 - string so there you go there's a you
06:46 - know nice little example of when this
06:48 - would be useful in real life so with
06:50 - that being said that's all the well I
06:53 - don't want to say that's all the string
06:54 - functions there probably like 200 string
06:56 - functions but those are all the main
06:58 - ones that I want to cover now that we
07:00 - covered all the main string functions
07:02 - whenever you're programming games and
07:04 - documents and applications later on and
07:06 - we come across you know a string
07:08 - function we don't have to look up what
07:10 - it means again there are a bunch of
07:12 - different other string functions but
07:14 - these are the main ones that you're
07:15 - going to come across in your programming
07:18 - so that being said take take a deep
07:20 - breath and we only got a couple more
07:23 - topics to cover so I am ready for it and
07:27 - to be honest I'm getting kind of tired
07:28 - of learn C++ plus I'm ready to move on
07:30 - to game development with C++ and 3D
07:33 - modeling with C++ and the fun stuff but
07:35 - hey we got to cover the boring stuff
07:37 - before we get to the fun stuff those are
07:39 - the rules of life so thank you guys so
07:41 - much for watching thank you guys for
07:42 - sticking with me for what was it like 73
07:44 - tutorials already uh I had super fun I
07:48 - had super you know I'm just going to
07:49 - quit talking right now before I mess up
07:51 - anything else but anyways thank you guys
07:52 - for watching and I'll see you guys in
07:53 - the next video
