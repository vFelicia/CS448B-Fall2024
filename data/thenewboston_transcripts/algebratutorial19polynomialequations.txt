00:00 - so now what we're gonna do is use
00:03 - everything we learned in these past
00:06 - couple lessons about multiplying to
00:08 - solve polynomial equations so the first
00:11 - thing we're gonna do is distribute this
00:14 - 2 and this 3 and we're gonna collect
00:19 - like terms and solve so 4x minus 2 is
00:23 - equal to 3x minus 6 plus 10 I combine
00:28 - these two I get 4x minus 2 equals 3x
00:31 - plus 4 I'm gonna add this 2 over and
00:35 - subtract this 3x over and I get X is
00:39 - equal to 6 so now we're just gonna do
00:45 - some more examples practicing's solving
00:48 - these polynomial equations ok so we're
00:53 - going to distribute this 2 again and
00:59 - this 3 2y plus 2 times 1 is 1 is 2 plus
01:05 - 3 times y 3y minus 3 times negative 1 3
01:10 - 9 so we're gonna combine these like
01:13 - terms so we get 5 like positive 2 minus
01:18 - 3 negative 1 is equal to 9 subtract that
01:22 - not that one over and we get 5y is equal
01:27 - excuse me add that one over I've I is
01:30 - equal to 10 y is equal to 2 okay so this
01:37 - one looks a little more complicated but
01:40 - the main thing to remember right here is
01:43 - that this negative right here stands for
01:45 - a negative 1 so even though it doesn't
01:48 - look like we have to distribute it we do
01:50 - because the signs gonna change when we
01:52 - multiply by that negative 1 so X minus x
01:56 - squared minus 1 times 2x x times
02:02 - negative 1 negative x negative 1 times
02:05 - negative 1 positive 1 5 plus 2x minus
02:11 - three x squared oh I forgot an x squared
02:14 - on that X right there so X minus X those
02:19 - X's are going to go away negative x
02:22 - squared minus three x squared gives me
02:24 - negative three x squared plus one is
02:28 - equal to 5 plus 2 X minus 3 X well I'm
02:34 - gonna bring this five over here and
02:36 - subtract or add this 3x onto the side so
02:40 - that's gonna go to zero one minus a
02:44 - negative or one minus 5 gives me
02:47 - negative 4 is equal to 2x if I divide by
02:51 - to get X is equal to negative 2 so we're
03:01 - gonna do one last example and this one's
03:03 - a little more complicated because we
03:05 - have a lot of squaring out to do but
03:08 - it's really helpful if you remember this
03:10 - little pattern that we figured out when
03:13 - we square binomials remember you get a
03:16 - squared plus 2 a B plus B squared so for
03:21 - this one 2x plus 1 squared I just have
03:24 - to square the first one 4 x squared I
03:28 - multiply these together 2x times 1 just
03:32 - be 2x multiply it by 2 plus 4x and
03:37 - square this term right here which is
03:39 - just going to be 1 and this is gonna be
03:41 - - and at first I'm gonna keep I'm gonna
03:45 - square this first and I'm gonna keep
03:48 - these terms inside parentheses so that I
03:50 - don't forget to distribute this negative
03:53 - 1 so I'm gonna do the same thing right
03:56 - here first squared is 4x squared these
04:01 - two multiplied is this time it's going
04:02 - to be negative 2x times 2 negative 4x
04:07 - and square this one it's still going to
04:09 - be positive 1 I'm going to square this
04:11 - one the same way x squared multiply
04:15 - these together you get 6x times 2 is 12
04:19 - X plus this one squared 36
04:24 - - x squared so I'm gonna combine these
04:28 - terms on the side just because I know
04:30 - that x squared - x squared is just gonna
04:33 - go to 0
04:34 - now I'm gonna distribute this negative
04:36 - one to each one so I get 4x squared plus
04:41 - 4x plus 1 negative 1 times 4x squared
04:46 - negative 4x squared negative 1 times
04:50 - negative 4x it's gonna give me positive
04:52 - 4x negative 1 times positive 1 is going
04:55 - to be negative 1 and I just have 12x
04:58 - plus 36 left on this side well a
05:02 - positive 4x squared and then negative 4x
05:06 - squared is gonna cancel and positive 1
05:12 - and a negative 1 are gonna cancel and 4x
05:16 - plus 4x is 8x is equal to 12x minus 36
05:21 - I'm going to subtract the 12x over an 8
05:25 - minus 12 is negative 4x is equal to
05:31 - positive 36 divided by negative 4 again
05:36 - X is equal to negative 9 so that's all
05:42 - we're gonna deal with today but in our
05:46 - next lesson we're going to talk about
05:48 - how we can use algebra to solve
05:51 - geometric problems like in geometry when
05:55 - we find perimeter or area we're going to
05:59 - use our polynomials to solve those so
06:04 - make sure you come back and check that
06:05 - out
