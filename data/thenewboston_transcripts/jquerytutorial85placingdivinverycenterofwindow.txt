00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - in this video we're going to be creating
00:08 - a div element that uh using width and
00:12 - height both for the window and the
00:13 - object we're able to place in the very
00:16 - center of the page uh and this is also
00:19 - dependent on moving the window as well
00:22 - so you can see I've got my code just
00:23 - behind me here uh and you can see that
00:25 - this will stay in the center of the page
00:28 - uh if we adjust the width
00:30 - uh or the height of the window so we
00:33 - constantly place this exactly in the
00:34 - middle of the page so it's an extremely
00:37 - simple way to do things we're going to
00:38 - create it a little messily uh this would
00:41 - be good as for examp as as an example a
00:44 - plugin uh but we're going to go and
00:46 - create it just very messily but just
00:48 - using the width and height to calculate
00:50 - where we should place this uh it's not
00:52 - as easy as placing it at half the width
00:54 - and half the height you have to then you
00:56 - know subt subtract off of the um actual
01:00 - object the half of the object height and
01:01 - width as well but we'll we'll cover that
01:03 - so um we'll go ahead and look at the
01:05 - code um or go into our text editor and
01:08 - start writing out the code for this okay
01:11 - so the first thing that we want to go
01:12 - ahead and do is create our element and
01:14 - then we're going to apply some styling
01:15 - to it you'll notice I've included
01:18 - style.css on the page uh and as well as
01:21 - jQuery obviously so we're using jQuery
01:23 - and ext.js as well so let's go ahead and
01:26 - just create this div and then we can
01:28 - start to style it and preview it in our
01:31 - browser um I've created a div and I'm
01:33 - going to give this an ID of very center
01:37 - and let's just go ahead and refresh the
01:39 - page you can see nothing but the div
01:40 - does exist here so let's go ahead into
01:42 - star. CSS and actually go ahead and sty
01:45 - this so very center and we're going to
01:48 - apply a few properties to this the first
01:51 - one is the height so I'm going to have
01:52 - this at 150 pixels uh then the width
01:56 - again 150 pixels uh I'm going to set a
01:59 - background color of black just so we can
02:01 - see where it is properly uh let's just
02:04 - refresh you can see that we've got that
02:06 - there uh let's just change that to 250
02:10 - sorry and lastly what we want to do is
02:13 - we want to set the position to
02:16 - Absolute and what this is going to allow
02:18 - us to do is use top and left inside of
02:21 - jQuery we're not going to do anything
02:23 - else to this style do uh this um div
02:27 - styling uh but position absolute means
02:30 - that we can move it around on the page
02:31 - exactly where we want it's it's fixed to
02:33 - our own custom position we can choose
02:36 - where we want it so for example I could
02:38 - say top 20 pixels and you can see that
02:42 - shifted 20 pixels from the top or left
02:45 - 200 pixels uh and that will have shifted
02:48 - 200 pixels from the left so we're going
02:50 - to be using the top and left to move
02:52 - this around and therefore we need
02:53 - position set to
02:55 - Absolute okay so now that we've created
02:57 - our div on index.php and our our uh
03:00 - styling on style.css we can go ahead and
03:03 - actually start to write this out and
03:05 - we're going to be writing the resize
03:07 - action inside of a function and we're
03:10 - going to be using the window resize
03:12 - event handler to call this function
03:14 - every time the window's resized but
03:16 - we're also going to be calling this
03:17 - function uh initially so it's set to the
03:20 - middle of the page initially so like I
03:21 - said slightly messy and it would be
03:23 - better used as you know like a Plugin or
03:25 - something uh but for now this will give
03:27 - you the general
03:28 - idea so so we want document and we want
03:31 - to apply the ready event handler and
03:33 - inside of here uh create a function
03:36 - we'll just go ahead and bring that down
03:38 - just the standard notation for when we
03:40 - use jQuery uh nothing to worry about uh
03:43 - that's just how we write it out so let's
03:45 - go ahead and create our uh move div
03:48 - function so function move div this will
03:51 - essentially uh this function will
03:53 - essentially grab the height and the
03:55 - width of the window the height and the
03:56 - width of the div itself uh and then
03:59 - it'll apply some kind of uh position to
04:02 - this and then we can you know call this
04:05 - function at any time on our on our
04:06 - inside of our
04:08 - document so the first thing we want to
04:10 - do is establish the window width and the
04:12 - window height so we use the width and
04:14 - the height to calculate this so I'm
04:17 - going to create a variable called window
04:18 - width and that's going to be equal to
04:21 - window do width quite simple we're using
04:25 - a jQuery selector and we're selecting
04:27 - the window and we're taking the width of
04:29 - of the window let's go ahead and say
04:32 - window height equals and exactly the
04:34 - same thing let's just tab these over
04:36 - window do height okay so let's go ahead
04:40 - and alert out window or let's go ahead
04:43 - and alert out width
04:46 - x height X and let's just go ahead and
04:49 - replace these X variables in
04:54 - here okay and we can just uh append on
04:57 - window height so we're taking the window
05:00 - width uh from here and we're applying it
05:03 - to a variable called window width we're
05:05 - taking the height using window height
05:07 - obviously window is the current window
05:09 - and it will change depending on where
05:10 - you move it uh and then we're alerting
05:12 - out the width so in here we can just
05:14 - call this function move div or down here
05:18 - uh so when the document is ready we
05:19 - Define this function or we uh yeah we
05:22 - Define this function and then we call
05:24 - the function down here so now when we
05:27 - refresh uh we get width 950 and height 4
05:30 - 59 so that's the current uh width of my
05:34 - window okay so now what we want to do is
05:38 - we don't want to just call that function
05:39 - yet in fact we do because we're going to
05:41 - do some more
05:42 - testing we want to grab the width and
05:45 - the height of the object so I'm going to
05:46 - call this object width and that's going
05:50 - to
05:51 - equal remember we called our div very
05:54 - center
