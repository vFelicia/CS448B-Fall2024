00:00 - what's up guys is Bucky welcome to
00:02 - another PHP tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial I'm gonna be talking about
00:05 - inheritance now before I go on you guys
00:08 - probably notice something's different
00:10 - from this story from last tutorial
00:11 - already and that is because I'm working
00:14 - with a new text editor and that is
00:17 - because I have a video uploading on my
00:19 - PC right now so I had to hop over to my
00:21 - Mac to make these tutorials so I had to
00:24 - download this text editor called text
00:26 - Wrangler and never used it before but
00:29 - they didn't have no pad plus plus for a
00:31 - Mac so anyways if I do something stupid
00:33 - like press a button or if I'm doing
00:35 - something weird then you know just let
00:38 - me know but anyways that's why I'm using
00:40 - the new text editor I actually when I
00:43 - uploaded this video I was gonna just
00:45 - play call of duty but I just texted my
00:47 - friend I'm like game time
00:48 - and he's like I'm eating dinner then I'm
00:51 - gonna see my girlfriend and so anyways
00:54 - no call of duty for me tonight so just
00:56 - making stories instead so good for you
00:59 - guys bad for me so anyways let's get
01:01 - right into it inheritance now
01:03 - inheritance is one of the key reasons
01:06 - why people prefer to use object-oriented
01:09 - PHP one of the many reasons but one of
01:11 - the biggest as well
01:12 - now inheritance is a lot like clone I
01:15 - think I taught you guys about clone last
01:17 - time I'm not sure though it's pretty
01:18 - much inheriting all the methods in all
01:22 - the variables from one class it pretty
01:25 - much takes everything from one class and
01:26 - imports it into another class so uh if
01:30 - you ever like read about it in a book
01:31 - they'll give you like eighteen chapters
01:33 - about it but that's basically all it is
01:35 - so let's go ahead and get coding this by
01:38 - the way it's a lot different typing on a
01:40 - Mac than it is BC so yeah you didn't
01:44 - need to know that but anyways class
01:45 - let's go ahead and make a new class the
01:48 - parent now whenever you use inheritance
01:53 - you always have to inherit from some
01:55 - class it's like a hierarchy like
01:57 - whenever you in hair something like if
01:59 - your grandma dies there always has to be
02:00 - someone you inherit from you just don't
02:02 - uninhibit from my god or whatever so
02:05 - anyways the order we say this in is the
02:09 - child inherits from
02:11 - parent so the parent is gonna have the
02:14 - class with all the stuff in it and the
02:16 - child class is gonna be the class where
02:18 - all that stuff goes into so anyways
02:20 - let's go ahead and and by the way they
02:21 - don't need to be named the parent I just
02:23 - want to make a very descriptive name so
02:25 - we don't get confused there so you can
02:27 - name it class anything name it
02:28 - tuna fish ham sandwich for all I care
02:30 - anyways go ahead and make a variable in
02:33 - here make sure it's public by the way
02:36 - okay
02:37 - okay Mac go and crazy on me already okay
02:40 - public and I name something stupid like
02:42 - p1 and go ahead and name this like I am
02:46 - a variable make sure you spell it
02:49 - totally wrong and let's go ahead and
02:51 - make a function like function some
02:55 - function looks like a pretty beautiful
02:57 - function right there okay Mac take it
03:01 - easy I should name my Mac Mac there we
03:05 - go tab what the heck's this little
03:07 - swirly key over here
03:09 - Oh anyways alright let's go ahead and
03:11 - just do something in this function like
03:13 - echo
03:14 - I am a funky monkey why not that sounds
03:19 - ridiculous so anyways so we have a class
03:22 - called the parent with variable and a
03:24 - function this is just a normal regular
03:27 - class but say we had another class right
03:29 - here called class the child and we're
03:34 - saying all right I made this other class
03:36 - called the child and what I want to do
03:40 - is I want to get this variable and this
03:44 - function inside this class but I'm Way
03:47 - too lazy to copy and paste it because
03:49 - you know if I do that that's gonna
03:50 - create a whole bunch of code anyways and
03:52 - you know pretty much lazy is just the
03:56 - biggest factor here so how can I get
03:58 - everything in here in here without
04:01 - having to retype it all well anytime you
04:04 - want to inherit all the stuff from some
04:06 - class what you need to do is this ext en
04:10 - D s extends and write the name of the
04:13 - class you want to inherit from right
04:15 - after it so the parent looking good so
04:19 - anyways before I go on I want to say one
04:21 - thing whoever gave us the keyword extend
04:25 - I just want to tell you this is the
04:27 - worst choice of keyword ever this is
04:29 - called inheritance so why not make this
04:31 - word and hair it or inherits from I
04:34 - don't know but anyways you have to use
04:36 - this dumb word extends and it basically
04:38 - means inherits from so now here's what's
04:41 - happening behind the scenes whenever you
04:43 - write extends the parent where you're
04:46 - telling PHP is this this class right
04:48 - here inherit everything from this class
04:52 - right here so even though there's
04:54 - nothing in this class
04:56 - PHP knows that it inherited everything
04:58 - in this class so whenever we make an
05:01 - object that's of the child and we K say
05:04 - all right the child has a variable
05:06 - called p1 actually let's just go ahead
05:08 - and type it so let's go ahead and make
05:11 - an object child object equals new the
05:18 - child so again what we're doing is we're
05:20 - making an object from this class right
05:22 - here and you're saying Bucky there's
05:24 - nothing in that class well actually
05:25 - there is there's a variable and a
05:27 - function and it thinks to this right
05:29 - here so we can go ahead and echo out
05:32 - something like child object and like p1
05:38 - and just go ahead and way too lazy to
05:44 - type all that all right copy that and by
05:47 - the way if you have a Mac and a PC you
05:51 - always I always do this instead of
05:55 - hitting like copy and paste i always
05:58 - accidentally hit FN copy and paste and
06:01 - it's annoying because the command key
06:03 - and the control key are different on the
06:05 - two keyboard so anyways watch out for
06:07 - that if you have both computers because
06:09 - it's extremely annoying so well it
06:12 - definitely should change that some I
06:15 - spell that right I guess we'll find out
06:18 - in a little bit
06:19 - so anyways check this out I made a child
06:21 - object right here and I echoed out the
06:23 - variable and the function and you're
06:26 - saying alright Bucky but didn't you
06:28 - forget to type that in that class right
06:30 - there well since it inherited from the
06:32 - parent class what it said it was it take
06:34 - took everything from the parent class
06:36 - and threw in the child class so you
06:39 - though can't see it it's there trust me
06:40 - so let me go ahead and save this and
06:43 - open up my Google Chrome right there
06:46 - refreshing move this over connection
06:51 - what's going on here oh I see like
06:55 - disconnected because I was inactive for
06:57 - 15 seconds okay overwrite that Oh oh my
07:02 - god since I'm uploading this video
07:03 - everything's going slow but let's go
07:05 - ahead and refresh my web page now and
07:07 - check this out I am a variable
07:11 - there's my variable right here and I am
07:13 - funky Munky there's my function right
07:15 - here so what we did if I can move this
07:19 - out of the way where's TextWrangler now
07:21 - all right so what we did is we made a
07:24 - parent class right here and you we
07:26 - pretty much made two classes Class A and
07:28 - Class B now we wanted everything from
07:32 - Class A to go in the Class B but we are
07:34 - way too lazy to type it so what we can
07:36 - do instead is write extends the parent
07:39 - right like that and now this Class B has
07:43 - this variable and this function without
07:45 - without having to retype it and if we
07:48 - went ahead and made another variable and
07:50 - set it equal to like 9 it would have
07:53 - this variable this variable and this
07:56 - function so that's pretty much the
07:57 - concept behind inheritance without my
08:00 - mess up pseudocode right there it's
08:03 - pretty much a way of getting everything
08:04 - from one class into another class
08:06 - without having or type it or copy and
08:09 - paste or anything like that so don't
08:11 - read any books because they give you the
08:13 - most weirdest most messed-up analogies
08:16 - and metaphors and it just confuses you
08:18 - that's all inheritance is right there so
08:21 - anyways thank you guys for watching I
08:23 - don't forget to subscribe I'm gonna try
08:24 - to figure out how to use my Mac and I
08:26 - guess I'll see you next tutorial
