00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to continue
00:07 - working on our favorites viewer
00:09 - application so before we get started I
00:12 - just want to give full credit to the
00:13 - authors of beginning Microsoft Visual
00:15 - Basic 2008 um the authors are thean
00:17 - Willis and Brian Newsome now they've
00:19 - made made this great app um I I've only
00:22 - found one error in it so far um but I'm
00:25 - going to be using it to teach you guys
00:27 - um some Visual Basic Concepts so if you
00:30 - don't know where we are right now then
00:31 - you may want to move back to one of the
00:33 - earlier tutorials so if you remember
00:36 - from the previous tutorial we added this
00:39 - if statement so if the file ends with
00:41 - URL then we want to try and get that um
00:44 - and use it as a favorite so we can use a
00:48 - tri uh TR catch
00:50 - statement and we we'll just enclose it
00:53 - in this in case um any errors
00:56 - happen so since the web favorites class
01:01 - right here implements I disposable we
01:05 - can use the using keyword so using
01:08 - object web favorite which is the name
01:11 - that we just created uh for the web
01:14 - favorite
01:15 - object as
01:18 - new web
01:21 - favorite so we're creating an object of
01:23 - the class web favorite which just um
01:27 - gets the favorite the fa favorite um URL
01:31 - and the name so that we can use it later
01:33 - on and that's the purpose of this class
01:35 - to get the name and the URL of a certain
01:37 - file
01:40 - so with this object what we want to do
01:42 - is we want to load the file information
01:45 - so we'll type object web favorite. load
01:48 - and we're going to use string file so
01:52 - string file is the let's see
01:56 - here the file that is in the directory
02:00 - that we're currently in which is the um
02:02 - favorites directory and it's the file
02:05 - that ends with URL so object web
02:08 - favorite. load so you can see here we've
02:10 - got web
02:13 - favorite. load and what this does is it
02:16 - gets the text um from that file and it
02:19 - store and it extracts the URL and the
02:22 - name so it's going to load that file and
02:26 - then we're just going to add that to the
02:27 - collection of favorites so favorites
02:33 - collection. add and then we we will add
02:37 - object web favorite so you can see here
02:39 - favorites collection is initialized to a
02:42 - new web favorite collection up here and
02:44 - the add method will go up and look at
02:46 - that it's just going to add uh the web
02:49 - favorite object to our list and we're
02:52 - passing object web favorite to
02:55 - it and so here is our end using and if
02:59 - we catch an exception let's just go
03:01 - ahead and let them know so we'll type
03:03 - messagebox Dosh
03:05 - show
03:07 - ex.
03:13 - message okay so for the time being we're
03:16 - done with creating and editing our
03:18 - classes so let's go ahead and let's find
03:21 - viewer. VB so we'll double click on the
03:24 - form itself to open up the load event
03:26 - for it so whenever our favorites viewer
03:29 - loads what do we want to do well we want
03:32 - to get all of our favorites and load
03:34 - them into the list so we'll just close
03:37 - this in a try catch statement in case
03:40 - anything goes
03:41 - wrong so we're going to be using object
03:47 - favorites as new favorites now the
03:50 - reason we're using using is because once
03:52 - we've added all this stuff to the list
03:54 - there's no reason for us to keep this
03:55 - object
03:57 - and the object favorites or the
04:00 - favorites class implements I disposable
04:02 - so we can use the using keyword so while
04:06 - we're using object favorites what we
04:08 - want to do is scan favorites so object
04:11 - favorites. scan
04:14 - favorites so we're using the version of
04:17 - this method that doesn't take any
04:20 - arguments so whenever we call Scan
04:22 - favorites it's going to scan favorites
04:24 - and it's going it's just going to scan
04:26 - our default favorites folder
04:30 - so we'll go ahead and come back in here
04:33 - and after we've scanned the favorites um
04:35 - and what this will do is it'll add the
04:38 - favorite to our collection so for each
04:41 - um it's going to add uh each of the
04:44 - favorites to our collection whenever we
04:46 - scan the
04:47 - favorites so now what we need to
04:50 - do is we need to go through each of the
04:54 - web favorite objects um in the favorites
04:56 - collection so we can do this by using a
04:59 - for each Loop so for each object web
05:03 - favorite as web favorite in object
05:09 - favorites. favorites collection now this
05:12 - might be a little confusing so I'll go
05:14 - ahead and explain it so we're creating
05:17 - an object of type webs fa web favorites
05:20 - and it's going to be inside of object
05:22 - favorites. favorites collection so
05:24 - here's object
05:26 - favorites and you can see here um that
05:29 - we have favorites collection which is of
05:31 - type web favorite collection so
05:33 - favorites has a collection that we can
05:35 - use um to store each one of the
05:37 - favorites so we're going to go through
05:38 - each of those favorites inside of this
05:40 - collection and what do we want to do
05:42 - with those
05:43 - favorites well we want to add them to
05:46 - our list so before we can do that we
05:49 - need to declare object list view
05:53 - item as new list view
05:57 - item now you can see that it says
05:59 - represent an item in a system. windows.
06:02 - forms. list view control so it's just
06:04 - going to be an item that goes um under
06:08 - one of these
06:10 - columns so now that we've created an
06:12 - object of the item let's go ahead and we
06:15 - need to set the properties of it so it
06:17 - we'll type object list view
06:21 - item. text is going to be equal to
06:24 - object web
06:26 - favorite. name
06:29 - so we have object web favorite right
06:32 - here um and it's it'll go through each
06:35 - of these object web favorites in our
06:37 - collection so it's going to get the name
06:39 - of that so the name is going to be the
06:41 - name of the
06:43 - file um which is let's see right here
06:47 - name and it just uses this substring to
06:49 - get the name of the file and leave out
06:51 - the stuff that we don't
06:53 - need so now what we need to do is we
06:55 - need to set um some other values so
06:58 - object list view items
07:00 - do SUB
07:02 - items.
07:04 - add and we'll add object list view
07:11 - item or not that sorry about that we
07:14 - want to add object web
07:18 - favorite.
07:19 - URL now
07:22 - because this URL column right here is a
07:26 - sub item of our list view we're going to
07:29 - use object list VI items. sub items. add
07:32 - and we're going to add the
07:34 - URL so after we've created this list
07:37 - view item we're just going to have to
07:39 - add it to the list so we'll
07:42 - type list or list
07:46 - favorites.
07:48 - items. add and we want to add this list
07:52 - view item so we'll just type object list
07:55 - view
07:56 - item and we'll close that off right
07:59 - there
08:00 - and now if there's an exception we just
08:02 - want to show that
