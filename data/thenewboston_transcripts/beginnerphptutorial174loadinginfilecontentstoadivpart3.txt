00:00 - so let's have a look down make sure
00:03 - everything there's okay yep
00:07 - let's just have another try of
00:10 - refreshing the page oh I think it
00:12 - actually did work yeah okay I think
00:16 - there was just a slight delay in loading
00:18 - the data in so I think yeah it did work
00:23 - so you can see now we've just retrieved
00:24 - this value and what's more important
00:27 - you've obviously noticed that by
00:28 - clicking submit the page hasn't
00:30 - refreshed itself at all
00:32 - so click Submit the page doesn't refresh
00:34 - yourself it just loads in the contents
00:37 - of the contents of including PHP okay so
00:45 - now what happens if we want to make this
00:47 - load function a bit more dynamic so for
00:50 - example I will might want to load in a
00:56 - specific file into a specific div so I
00:59 - need to specify some arguments in my
01:01 - load function so the first one I might
01:04 - want to specify is the div that I want
01:08 - to load the data into so this in this
01:11 - case it would be a div and then the
01:14 - second parameter or argument I want to
01:17 - give it is the file that I want to load
01:19 - into this div so that might be including
01:21 - dot PHP now this function would be a lot
01:23 - better because it means you could reuse
01:24 - it over and over again and it would be
01:27 - really really useful if you had a page
01:28 - where you wanted to insert some dynamic
01:31 - data into many different divs and wanted
01:33 - to do this using lots of different
01:35 - buttons or in actual fact when the mouse
01:37 - was moved or something like that so we
01:41 - are going to use this to our advantage
01:45 - and create a fully rounded function
01:48 - that's going to allow us to do this so
01:50 - we want to load into a diff this is the
01:52 - first argument and in and load this file
01:55 - into a div which is the second argument
01:56 - so let's go ahead and make the change
01:59 - first of all in this load part of the
02:01 - function if you're used to functions
02:03 - then this will be pretty straightforward
02:04 - but I'm going to go through it anyway
02:07 - just so we know what we're doing so the
02:10 - first one is the div
02:12 - and the second one is the file okay so
02:17 - we've got the div which we're loading it
02:19 - into and the file so all we need to now
02:21 - do is go down and make the changes so
02:23 - the div here is specified as a div but
02:26 - we want this to be dynamic depending on
02:28 - what we pass through this function so
02:30 - this is just going to be the div now
02:33 - let's go down this again needs this this
02:37 - file here needs to be dynamic so this is
02:41 - the file so it's really as simple as
02:43 - that now what we've done is we've
02:44 - created ourselves a dynamic function
02:46 - that's going to load any file into any
02:48 - div so let's go ahead and change the
02:50 - name of this div so another div for
02:52 - example we've just changed the name of
02:55 - it to demonstrate the use of this
02:56 - function so now let's change this to
02:58 - another div and we'll keep the include
03:02 - file as it is but we'll change the
03:03 - content so hello everyone okay so let's
03:09 - go ahead and come onto our page when we
03:13 - click Submit what this is going to do
03:15 - let's just go to our page source om chap
03:17 - translating it to English all right
03:19 - let's go to page source and go down so
03:22 - it's a loading into another day of and
03:25 - it's loading this file here into another
03:26 - div so let's go ahead and click Submit
03:28 - and you can see that hello every one has
03:30 - been loaded into the div another div
03:33 - let's go down and have a look there and
03:35 - we've got div ID equals another div now
03:38 - because of the nature of Ajax and the
03:40 - way it works you can see at the moment
03:42 - that there's nothing contained within
03:47 - this div even though in here we have the
03:50 - text hello everyone so there's no need
03:52 - to worry about this if you're looking at
03:54 - a source file thinking oh nothing's in
03:56 - there it won't actually modify the HTML
03:59 - because it's a synchronous and it does
04:01 - it without refreshing the page we're not
04:03 - going to be updating the HTML code as
04:05 - well so you won't find your text that
04:09 - you are putting into your div actually
04:11 - within your dear it's just going to be
04:13 - done on the page itself to the people
04:18 - that are viewing it so it's not actually
04:19 - going to be put into here
04:20 - so what we've done in this tutorial is
04:22 - we've looked at creating a function that
04:25 - loads in two arguments and this is on
04:30 - the click of a button but this could be
04:31 - on any HTML state so it could be when
04:34 - you start typing in a text field so
04:38 - we're going to look at tutorials later
04:39 - on that deal with more complex PHP that
04:42 - is going to put values onto our page
04:45 - depending on what we type or when we
04:47 - move the mouse etc etc so we've gone
04:50 - through and we've checked for certain
04:52 - things set this HTML XML HTTP variable
04:56 - we've checked for the state change and
04:58 - upon the state change we've modified the
05:00 - contents of the div and then here what
05:03 - we've done is we've specified the file
05:05 - that we want to open and we've used this
05:07 - send to send the data so that's
05:09 - basically simply opening a file using
05:11 - Ajax this is pure Ajax so we're not
05:14 - using anything like jQuery here and
05:16 - jQuery is easier however I do recommend
05:20 - you do learn this and learn how to do
05:23 - this because it's going to be really
05:25 - useful later on when you want to write
05:30 - in pure JavaScript and use Ajax as it
05:34 - should be as its as its intended to be
05:37 - so that's it for including a file using
05:42 - Ajax without refreshing the page
