00:01 - okay so today we're g to finally be
00:05 - finding the volume of a
00:08 - prism so the volume of a rectangular
00:11 - prism is length time width time
00:15 - height so
00:20 - length times
00:25 - width times our
00:30 - perpendicular height or
00:34 - altitude
00:36 - so volume is equal to
00:40 - 14 *
00:43 - 15 *
00:45 - 5 so since those are kind of big numbers
00:48 - I'm going to put this in a
00:50 - calculator
00:52 - 14 *
00:55 - 15 *
00:57 - 5 1
01:01 - 050
01:03 - cm
01:05 - cubed because we're taking
01:08 - cenm time C cenm time cenm so we're
01:13 - going to get centime cubed
01:16 - volume because it's a measure of
01:19 - threedimensional
01:21 - it measures how much space something
01:24 - takes up and since space is a
01:28 - three-dimensional measure we have to
01:30 - have cenm
01:33 - cubed a volume of a non rectangular
01:39 - prism is its base area times its height
01:45 - so for this triangle it would be 1 12
01:49 - base time height because that would be
01:51 - the area of this space right here times
01:55 - the
01:57 - height of
02:00 - the
02:02 - prism so for this triangle it's going to
02:04 - be 1
02:06 - 12 base which is this five right
02:10 - here times height which is which has
02:13 - been drawn in for us and it's
02:15 - perpendicular to the base and its
02:17 - measures
02:19 - 3
02:22 - time 3 so first what we're going to do
02:25 - is find the um area of the base which
02:30 - we're just going to call Ba
02:33 - so
02:36 - 12 5 *
02:39 - 3 okay
02:42 - so 12 of 5 * 3 1 12 5 * 3 is 15 so our
02:48 - base area is 15 halfes so now we're
02:52 - going to take 15 halves and times it by
02:55 - 3 15 * 3 is 45 over
03:00 - to and pretend that they gave us that
03:03 - this is millimet so it' be millim cubed
03:07 - and I'm just going to leave it like that
03:08 - because there's no point in getting a
03:11 - not pretty decimal this is more
03:13 - accurate so now we're going to do an
03:17 - example find the volume so this is a
03:22 - trapezoidal
03:24 - prism because its bases are a
03:27 - trapezoid so first
03:30 - for the volume it's base area times
03:33 - height so let's find our base area if
03:36 - you remember the area of a trapezoid is
03:39 - 1
03:40 - 12 base 1 which is
03:44 - 4 plus base 2 which is
03:48 - 8 times the perpendicular
03:51 - height which is
03:54 - 3 so make sure you add these together
03:57 - before you multiply by two or 1/2 I mean
04:00 - so 4 + 8 is 12 12 of 12 is 6 * 3 is 18
04:10 - so the area of our base is is 18 cm
04:15 - squared so now we're going to take our
04:19 - base area and multiply it by the height
04:22 - of this prism which is three so our
04:27 - volume is
04:31 - 54 cm
04:36 - cubed well that's actually all we're
04:39 - going to do for
04:42 - volume but make sure you come back and
04:44 - watch the next lesson where we're going
04:47 - to talk about the surface area of a
04:49 - cylinder
