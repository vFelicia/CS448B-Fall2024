00:00 - what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome to
00:02 - your very first backgammon tutorial now
00:05 - I know a lot of you guys know me already
00:07 - and know me for my computer programming
00:09 - tutorials but what you didn't know is
00:11 - that I love playing backgammon I've been
00:14 - playing in my whole entire life I'm
00:16 - addicted to it absolutely love it so
00:18 - since I love backgammon the other day I
00:21 - was bored so I went on YouTube and I
00:23 - look for Beckham tutorials in backgammon
00:26 - videos in every single backgammon video
00:29 - I saw was absolutely horrible all the
00:32 - tutorials were horrendous so I felt as a
00:35 - tutorial McClurg on YouTube it was kind
00:39 - of my obligation to teach you guys how
00:41 - to play backgammon since I mean these
00:44 - tutorials were some of the worst
00:45 - tutorials I have ever seen they explain
00:47 - it so terribly so it's my job now to
00:50 - teach you guys how to play backgammon
00:52 - and make a decent beginners tutorial so
00:56 - in this next video that's what I'm about
00:58 - to do so for all of you who are hoping
01:00 - for computer program tutorials check out
01:02 - my other videos this is for backgammon
01:04 - so let's go ahead and get started now
01:07 - here is the basics of the game I'm gonna
01:10 - assume you this is the first time you
01:12 - ever see in the back end board the
01:14 - basics of the game is this it's played
01:16 - between two people in these tutorials
01:19 - I'm gonna be white and you're gonna be
01:21 - brown or it kind of looks like black on
01:23 - the camera to me right now so each
01:27 - player gets 15 checkers each you have 15
01:30 - checkers and I have 15 checkers the goal
01:33 - of the game is to get all of your
01:36 - checkers off the board before the other
01:38 - person can get all of their checkers off
01:40 - the board now the board is set up like
01:43 - this you have 24 narrow triangles and
01:47 - these are called points now what I went
01:52 - ahead and did is I wrote the numbers of
01:54 - your points on the board but typically
01:57 - when you buy a backgammon board or if
02:00 - you're playing in a tournament or
02:01 - something these points aren't gonna be
02:03 - written on the board I just went ahead
02:05 - and since we're first learning and I say
02:07 - like 9 point you can see that this has a
02:10 - nine right there so it'll just help you
02:12 - follow along
02:12 - but like I said whenever you buy a
02:14 - backgammon board don't expect to see the
02:16 - points so anyways the board consists of
02:19 - 24 triangles called points now yours go
02:24 - in let's say let's see this is clockwise
02:27 - order from smallest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
02:33 - 11 12 and then hops over here and it
02:35 - goes 13 through 18 in 19 through 24
02:40 - so we separate these in six points each
02:44 - and these are called quadrants one
02:47 - quadrant two quadrant three quadrant
02:49 - four project one through six your one
02:52 - through six is called your home board
02:54 - your 7 through 12 is called your outer
02:57 - board my 1 through 6 is called mine home
03:00 - board my 7 through 12 is called my outer
03:03 - board so whenever I'm saying all right
03:05 - move a checker into your home board I'm
03:07 - talking about somewhere your 1 to 6
03:09 - right here I just wanted to give you
03:11 - guys the definitions and you know all
03:14 - the technical words before you know I
03:17 - started saying something and you guys
03:18 - don't know what it means so anyways
03:19 - that's all the terms right now let's go
03:21 - ahead and just start setting up the
03:22 - board now oh one more thing this piece
03:27 - in the middle this is called the bar now
03:30 - typically you don't want your checkers
03:32 - to end up on the bar but whenever I
03:34 - refer to the bar this is what I'm
03:36 - talking about so anyways like I said
03:38 - let's go ahead and set up the game right
03:39 - now in order to set up the game you need
03:42 - to put all of your 15 checkers on the
03:44 - board now you just don't put them
03:46 - randomly around like that you need to
03:47 - set them up in some special way so
03:48 - here's how you do it go ahead and take
03:51 - five of your checkers and put them on
03:54 - your six point just like that go ahead
03:58 - and take three of your checkers and put
04:02 - them on your eighth point
04:05 - simple enough go ahead and take five of
04:08 - your checkers and put them on your
04:11 - thirteen point just like that and go
04:16 - ahead and take your last two checkers
04:18 - and put them on your 24 point and by the
04:23 - way
04:24 - since your 24-point is here and your one
04:27 - point is here you're going to be moving
04:29 - from highest to lowest so this is your
04:32 - direction of play you're going to be
04:33 - taking your checkers and moving them
04:35 - around here down here and finally off
04:38 - the board here so you know you can't
04:41 - move checkers this way it's invalid so
04:43 - anyway so you go from high to low now
04:46 - for your opponent to set up their
04:48 - checkers here's what I do I make an
04:51 - exact mirror image of your checkers so
04:53 - wherever you have five checkers across
04:56 - from that I'm gonna put five checkers so
05:00 - you have five checkers on your six I'm
05:02 - gonna have five checkers across from you
05:05 - so since you have two checkers right
05:07 - here I'm gonna go ahead and put two
05:08 - checkers right here you have three right
05:11 - here I'm going go ahead the three right
05:14 - here and you have five right here so I'm
05:18 - gonna go ahead and put my five right
05:23 - there nice a alright
05:25 - we know it's setup right because my
05:27 - checkers are a perfect mirror image from
05:31 - your checkers never saying all right
05:32 - this is a little weird because my
05:35 - checkers are on your 19-point and it
05:39 - should be my six point well check this
05:40 - out
05:41 - whenever I'm playing I'm gonna be
05:44 - playing in this direction right here
05:46 - remember I'm white
05:47 - so this point your one is actually my 24
05:50 - point this may be kind of hard but flip
05:53 - your computer monitor upside down and
05:54 - you can see what's going on so one two
05:56 - three four five six
05:58 - this is actually my six point and one
06:01 - two three four five six this is your six
06:03 - point two so while you're playing in
06:05 - this direction I'm gonna be playing in
06:09 - this direction in our checkers since
06:12 - we're playing in opposite directions are
06:14 - gonna come into conflict with each other
06:15 - and that's where the game gets
06:17 - interesting so anyways I just want to
06:19 - tell you guys that this is a basic start
06:21 - up so if you're playing along pause the
06:24 - video right now and set your board up
06:25 - like this
