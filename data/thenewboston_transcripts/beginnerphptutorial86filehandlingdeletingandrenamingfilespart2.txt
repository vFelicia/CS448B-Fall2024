00:00 - so let's go ahead and run this code and
00:03 - see what result we achieve so let me
00:06 - just refresh the page and you can see
00:07 - that the file deletes is still there so
00:09 - we can double check if this is working
00:11 - we're making sure it's there first of
00:13 - all let's click on file dot PHP okay so
00:16 - file file to delete ext has been deleted
00:19 - let's go back and refresh and you can
00:22 - see that that's been deleted so now what
00:24 - happens if we run the code again this
00:26 - function is not going to work because
00:28 - it's not going to be able to find the
00:29 - file specified let's click on that okay
00:31 - so we get a warning up so unlink file to
00:34 - delete no such file or directory and
00:36 - we've got our error message up here so
00:38 - what we can do is we can actually change
00:39 - our code it says here file has been
00:42 - deleted we don't keep that in the editor
00:44 - so what we can do is we can change our
00:46 - code and we can burn at symbol before
00:48 - this so we're not going to get this
00:49 - warning up in PHP let's go ahead and
00:52 - refresh and you can see that we've just
00:53 - got our plain error message on its own
00:56 - so now we've successfully looked at
00:58 - deleting a file what happens if we want
01:00 - to rename a file so let's go ahead and
01:02 - get rid of everything on this page okay
01:06 - so we want to fire we want to rename
01:08 - this file to a random array if you like
01:11 - of numbers so we're going to be using
01:14 - the round function to generate a large
01:15 - random number and then we're going to
01:17 - rename this file here to that random
01:20 - number and then dot txt so we're still
01:22 - maintaining the file extension okay so
01:25 - let's go ahead to file dot PHP let's
01:27 - first of all specify the file name in in
01:30 - a string datatype so this is far to
01:32 - rename txt now let's go ahead and create
01:36 - a random number now if you haven't
01:37 - already looked at creating random
01:39 - numbers in PHP we use the rand function
01:42 - so let's go ahead and say Rand is equal
01:45 - to Rand and this is going to take two
01:47 - parameters it's going to take a lower
01:48 - and an upper limit so we can say set our
01:51 - lower limit to 10,000 and we can set our
01:53 - upper limit to 99999 so this is going to
01:57 - generate a five digit number between
02:00 - these two numbers so this is the lower
02:02 - and this is the upper here so the
02:06 - function name that we use is simply
02:08 - rename so remember before I said delete
02:10 - isn't as obvious when we use the unlink
02:12 - function but with renaming we just use
02:14 - the rename function okay so let's go
02:17 - ahead and do that
02:18 - so let's say rename now this is going to
02:20 - take two parameters obviously because
02:22 - what we need to do is specify the file
02:23 - name to rename and also what we want to
02:26 - call it after that so let's go ahead and
02:28 - we'll say rename file name and we're
02:33 - renaming this to R and remember you need
02:35 - to append on txt because we're still
02:38 - maintaining the file extension so if you
02:40 - don't have if you don't depend on a dot
02:42 - txt this R and value is just going to be
02:45 - the file itself so we're just going to
02:46 - have a number so it's going to be an
02:48 - unspecified file type so again let's go
02:51 - ahead and enclose this in an if
02:53 - statement so what we're doing is we're
02:55 - checking that the file has been
02:56 - successfully renamed and then otherwise
02:58 - we're giving an error message so let's
03:01 - go ahead and say echo file and then we
03:05 - can append on file name and then we can
03:09 - append on has been renamed to and then
03:12 - we can append on the phone name that has
03:14 - been renamed to so R and and then its
03:16 - dot txt so we'll put that in strong and
03:20 - we'll put that in strong there and then
03:25 - file file name so it's just basically
03:30 - basic concatenation of string data with
03:34 - the inclusion of variables so otherwise
03:37 - let's go ahead and say error renaming
03:42 - okay so this is going to happen this
03:44 - error is going to be produced when we've
03:46 - already renamed the file name to the
03:48 - random txt so like I said before the
03:51 - reason you might want to rename your
03:52 - files to a random number is to keep them
03:54 - hidden from users you may have this
03:56 - random number stored in a database
03:58 - somewhere so your database knows where
04:00 - the file is but your users don't so they
04:02 - won't be able to look at the file
04:05 - specifically on the server there's many
04:07 - reasons why you'd want to obviously
04:08 - rename a file but I'm just giving this
04:10 - as an example so let's go back and
04:12 - refresh you can see that we've still got
04:14 - file to rename dot txt that's going to
04:16 - file dot PHP so now it says file file to
04:20 - rename txt has been renamed to four one
04:23 - nine seven five TX
04:25 - - okay so we've successfully renamed it
04:27 - to a random number now let's go back
04:30 - again and let's refresh and you can see
04:33 - that that in fact has changed to four
04:35 - one nine seven five txt so in this
04:38 - tutorial we've looked excessively at the
04:40 - unlink and the rename function why they
04:43 - might be useful and we've just given a
04:45 - brief example so remember when you put
04:47 - your functions inside an if statement
04:50 - what we're doing is we're checking that
04:52 - this function is successful therefore
04:54 - we're only giving a confirmation message
04:55 - when we've successfully let's say
04:57 - renamed or deleted a file
