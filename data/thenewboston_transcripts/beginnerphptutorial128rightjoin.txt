00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston now in the last uh example we've
00:08 - looked at um left joining where we um
00:13 - return let's give you an example in the
00:15 - SQL
00:16 - tab um we have said left join pets on
00:20 - where people. ID equals pets. people ID
00:22 - so if we click go we're given a list of
00:25 - um people on this hand side and the pets
00:28 - that relate to them on this hand side so
00:30 - we've got two different tables people uh
00:33 - where we've got the um ID which is
00:35 - unique to each person and we've got pets
00:37 - where um we're ignoring the ID for now
00:39 - but people ID is uh one for Alex and two
00:42 - for Dale so uh we're just displaying
00:44 - this information now what happens if for
00:47 - example we have got um uh dog which is
00:51 - relative to two um people ID 2 which is
00:54 - Dale but we delete Dale from the
00:56 - database so let's delete Dale from the
00:58 - database let's go aad and run this query
01:01 - again and click go now you can see that
01:05 - it's not return it's only returned Alex
01:07 - um and Cat and fish because
01:12 - um because uh Dale now doesn't exist now
01:15 - what happens if we want to display data
01:18 - on the uh right hand side even if the
01:21 - the corresponding value on the left hand
01:23 - side doesn't exist now for this we use
01:26 - the right join we've used left join but
01:29 - if we change this to right join what
01:32 - we're now doing is even if this people
01:34 - ID doesn't exist we're still displaying
01:37 - it um because we're right joining so
01:39 - let's click go and see what result we
01:41 - achieve Okay so we've got pet catfish
01:44 - and dog dog still exist in the database
01:46 - in this table pets but the owner does
01:50 - not exist now in people so why is this
01:53 - useful why can we use this right join
01:55 - well in this case it doesn't really make
01:57 - too much sense unless we were saying you
01:59 - know um the dog is now I don't know
02:02 - homeless and it's been abandoned the
02:03 - user no longer exists so it could be a
02:06 - pet owner's website for example this
02:08 - user might unregister or or yeah
02:11 - unregister so so um they might delete
02:14 - their account and now dog is left
02:16 - homeless so that's just an example a
02:18 - silly example but I'm sure you can
02:20 - understand where this is going so for
02:22 - Left for if we want to represent the
02:24 - data on the left even if it doesn't have
02:26 - a value on the right we use the left
02:28 - join if we are on the if we want to
02:31 - represent the data on the right hand
02:33 - side even if it doesn't have a data on
02:35 - the even if it doesn't have a value that
02:38 - corresponds to it um after the on
02:40 - keyword on the left hand side we still
02:42 - show this so we've shown this as null so
02:45 - inside PHP we can make this comparison
02:47 - and say that dog doesn't actually have
02:49 - an owner so that's basically um the
02:52 - difference between the left and the
02:54 - right hand side joins so we use left
02:56 - join if we want to display data on the
02:59 - uh uh on the left even if it doesn't
03:01 - exist on the right and vice versa with
03:03 - the right drawing we display data on the
03:05 - right even if it doesn't exist on the
03:07 - left
