00:00 - okay so we're gonna start off with
00:05 - congruent angles and congruent angles
00:08 - are just angles that have equal measures
00:10 - and we measure angles in degrees so we
00:15 - have right here angle ABC and if we
00:19 - measured it we would find that the
00:22 - measure of angle ABC is about 63 degrees
00:27 - and over here we have angle D EF and if
00:33 - you measured that you would find out
00:35 - that that is about 63 degrees as well so
00:39 - since the measure of angle ABC equals
00:44 - the measure of angle D EF we can say
00:49 - that angle ABC and angle D EF are
00:59 - congruent angles okay so now that we
01:08 - know that we're gonna go onto something
01:10 - else which is called the addition
01:12 - property of angles so we have Ray I n
01:18 - which is this one directional line right
01:21 - here and it lies between ray I M and Ray
01:26 - I K so that means that the measure of
01:31 - angle mi n plus the measure of angle n I
01:38 - K equals the measure of this entire
01:45 - angle which makes sense because if you
01:48 - add up the parts of something you're
01:51 - going to get the total of the whole so
01:55 - say I know that the measure of M I n is
02:00 - equal to 63 degrees and I know that the
02:05 - measure of n I K is equal to 55 degrees
02:12 - I can take each one of those parts and
02:15 - add them together in order to get what
02:20 - the whole angle is equal to and if you
02:23 - add 63 plus 55 you get a hundred and
02:27 - eighteen degrees
02:29 - so therefore the measure of angle M I K
02:34 - is equal to 118 degrees okay so now that
02:42 - we know that we're gonna do a couple
02:44 - examples using these two properties okay
02:48 - so I know that angle QR T is equal to 62
02:55 - degrees if the measure of angle TRS
02:59 - which is this angle right here is equal
03:01 - to 43 degrees what is the measure of
03:06 - this whole angle so I can take 62 plus
03:13 - 43 and I get a hundred and five so the
03:20 - big angle angle Q RS is equal to a
03:24 - hundred and five so for number two I
03:29 - know that the measure of h IJ which is
03:33 - this entire angle is 138 and I know that
03:42 - the measure of this part angle H I K is
03:46 - equal to 30 degrees so what is the
03:49 - measure of K of angle K IJ which is this
03:56 - part right here so since I know the
03:58 - measure of the total I can take the sum
04:03 - of the parts
04:10 - and set it equal to 138 with X being the
04:18 - measure of this angle so if I subtract
04:23 - 38 from 138 I'm gonna find out what the
04:29 - other part equals which is a hundred so
04:32 - therefore the measure of angle K IJ is
04:36 - equal to a hundred degrees that's using
04:41 - the same property I'm just doing the
04:44 - opposite okay so now we have one more
04:50 - example example three angle ABC and
05:00 - angle CBD are congruent if measure of
05:09 - angle ABC or excuse me measure of angle
05:14 - abd is equal to 120 what is the measure
05:20 - of angle a B what is the measure of
05:27 - angle ABC and CBD well since these two
05:35 - angles are congruent that means that
05:37 - they have the same measure so if we let
05:41 - the measure of ABC equal x equals x we
05:49 - can take 2x and set it to the total
05:54 - because these two angles represent two
05:58 - equal parts of the whole angle so to
06:02 - find out what each angle equals we can
06:06 - just take 120 and divide it by 2
06:10 - and you'll find that each angle equals
06:16 - 60 degrees
06:18 - okay so now that you know the properties
06:22 - of angles be sure to watch the next
06:26 - video which will go over special angle
06:29 - pairs and how they relate to one another
