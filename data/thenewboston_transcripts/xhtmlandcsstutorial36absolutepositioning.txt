00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 36th XHTML and CSS
00:05 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
00:07 - to be talking to you guys about
00:08 - something called positioning so before
00:12 - whenever we are making websites and we
00:14 - added like an image and then a header
00:16 - and then a paragraph and then you know
00:18 - maybe some links or something everything
00:20 - kind of appeared after one another kind
00:23 - of flowed together in a nice in the
00:25 - order I mean your image new
00:27 - automatically not to appear on top of
00:29 - your text to cover it up and whenever
00:31 - you made a paragraph it didn't just put
00:33 - them in a random location it put it
00:35 - under whatever was there before like
00:37 - under your header or under your image so
00:40 - everything kind of flowed automatically
00:42 - but while this is good if you're going
00:45 - for that you know kind of boring
00:47 - organized look it didn't give you a
00:49 - whole lot of control over the layout and
00:52 - look of your website so in this is our
00:54 - oh I'm going to teach you guys how to
00:55 - change all that using something called
00:57 - absolute positioning now let's go ahead
01:00 - and look at an example right now so I'm
01:02 - going to make two divs or aka two boxes
01:05 - on the screen and I'm going to show you
01:07 - guys how to move them around exactly
01:08 - where you want so let's go ahead and
01:10 - make a div with ID of I don't know
01:13 - apples and just go ahead and end that
01:16 - div let's add some text in that I am the
01:19 - Apple box isn't there cereal like Apple
01:22 - Jacks that's what I was thinking of so
01:25 - let's go ahead and copy this and add
01:27 - another div with ID blueberry and just
01:32 - put like
01:34 - Yolo so Lyon blueberry this can be a
01:38 - Mexican blueberry box
01:39 - so anyways go ahead and save this and
01:42 - see what we have on our screen so far we
01:45 - have I am the Apple box and yo soy
01:47 - blueberry the blueberry box so in order
01:50 - to you know visualize these a little
01:52 - better let's go ahead up in CSS and give
01:54 - them a border you know actually
01:57 - so they actually look like boxes so go
01:59 - ahead and in your apples let's add some
02:02 - rules to it border equals two pics solid
02:07 - red because apples are red they might
02:09 - make it easier to tell and let's see in
02:12 - order to apply that absolute positioning
02:14 - here's what you need to do type in the
02:17 - attribute position and for the value
02:22 - type absolute and now well uh it's
02:28 - better if I just show you what absolute
02:29 - positioning is so anyways just leave it
02:31 - like this my newest since these are
02:32 - boxes we need to give them a couple
02:34 - things first of all a width in the
02:36 - height so CSS knows how wide and how
02:38 - tall to draw that border and also a top
02:41 - in the left or pretty much coordinate so
02:43 - it knows where on the screen to draw the
02:45 - border so with equals I don't know let's
02:49 - say 150 pixels and height equals hundred
02:54 - seventy five pixels that'll be good for
02:56 - this resolution so now we need to say
02:59 - where on the screen do you want to draw
03:01 - this box well 30 pixels down from the
03:03 - top is good and let's say right in other
03:08 - words 15 pixels from the left so now
03:11 - let's go ahead and save this and see
03:13 - what we got we got a red box to pixel
03:16 - solid red it's absolute in the width is
03:19 - 150 by 175 and it's 30 pixels down from
03:24 - the top and 15 pixels from the right so
03:27 - now you're saying this is pretty cool
03:29 - because now I can have my elements and
03:31 - boxes and I can move them anywhere I
03:33 - want around the screen so for example
03:35 - your boss comes in he's like Bucky and
03:38 - make this a hundred more pixels to the
03:40 - right and I mark in some more pixels
03:42 - down sort of saying alright now I can
03:44 - add 100 pixels of that
03:46 - and instead of 30 put it like 40 and
03:49 - save it in BAM check it out move it over
03:53 - some and move it down some pretty cool
03:55 - but now we're going to run into a
03:58 - problem and that's this it's not so much
04:00 - a problem as something that you just
04:02 - need to look out for go ahead and copy
04:05 - this and let's see if this works go
04:10 - ahead and now let's make a box for
04:12 - blueberry and let's first of all make
04:15 - that border blue so we can see what
04:17 - we're doing and make the width mm I mean
04:21 - those look pretty good so change this to
04:23 - 30 and you know 15 whoa easy Hoss so now
04:28 - in our blueberry box we have a blue
04:30 - border the position is absolute still
04:33 - the width and height they're the same
04:35 - but it's just at different coordinates
04:36 - so now whenever we save this and refresh
04:39 - this we see that something weird happens
04:42 - that didn't happen before with absolute
04:44 - positioning absolute positioning
04:47 - basically says our a I'm going to give
04:49 - you complete control over where to place
04:52 - your elements but I don't care if any
04:54 - other element is in my way I don't care
04:56 - if any other boxes in my way if it is
04:59 - I'm just going to overlap it F it I only
05:01 - care about myself so while this is an
05:05 - excellent way to position elements on
05:07 - the screen exactly where you want them
05:09 - you need to look out for a couple things
05:10 - first of all before whenever we just
05:13 - made dumb old web sites everything was
05:15 - positioned nice and neatly now we run
05:18 - into the problem of things might having
05:21 - to bump into each other or overlapping
05:22 - so whenever you're making your websites
05:25 - you have to make sure don't overlap your
05:28 - stuff or it's going to be hard to read I
05:30 - mean look it this is a you know this
05:33 - would be pretty hard to read if we had
05:34 - two paragraphs in here and you overlap
05:36 - them and try to read them together
05:38 - so anyways whenever you're making a
05:39 - website you have to watch out not to
05:42 - overlap your stuff right now because
05:44 - even though we have control over exactly
05:47 - where things go we have to watch out not
05:49 - to make them bump into each other so
05:51 - anyways it doesn't flow like other XHTML
05:56 - would just by default
05:58 - and anyways you guys can see what's
05:59 - going on so this is basically absolute
06:03 - positioning the idea that you can take
06:05 - an element and put it absolutely in a
06:08 - location no matter what else is in the
06:10 - way so saying all right this is pretty
06:12 - cool I'm just going to take all my
06:14 - elements and arrange them make sure they
06:17 - don't overlap and I'm just going to make
06:18 - a website like that well before you're
06:21 - just going and before you just go and
06:23 - make an entire website out of absolute
06:25 - positioning there are two other forms of
06:28 - positioning I want to teach you guys
06:29 - about and when you use them together
06:31 - it's going to give you a whole lot more
06:34 - control and it's going to make your
06:35 - website so much better so before you
06:38 - just go make a website with tons of
06:40 - boxes like this all over stick with me
06:43 - for the next couple of tutorials I'm
06:44 - going to be teaching you about some
06:46 - different types of positioning and trust
06:48 - me you will thank me by the end of these
06:50 - tutorials so anyways thank you guys for
06:52 - watching hopefully you guys understand
06:53 - the concept of absolute positioning and
06:55 - if you don't then just stick with me in
06:58 - these next couple stories you will so
07:01 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
07:02 - subscribe and I'll see you guys later
