00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with another video for the new boss turn
00:04 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - looking at jquery ajax requests but
00:10 - we're also then going to look at how to
00:11 - handle different status codes for
00:14 - example a 404 page not found error so
00:17 - just to start with we have a simple
00:20 - button in our page with the idea button
00:22 - and we have a div area with the ID of
00:24 - content so when our page it looks like
00:26 - this this load button is then going to
00:29 - load a page onto our into our div and
00:32 - that is page to HTML and there's just
00:34 - some content written in here Ajax Doge
00:37 - is is going to handle this request for
00:39 - us I've already set up a selector for
00:42 - the button and an on click event or a
00:44 - click event and that will handle the
00:47 - clicking of the button will now go ahead
00:50 - and create the Ajax request but then
00:52 - just put these status code in there as
00:56 - well so it's dollar sign Ajax and then
01:00 - in brackets we create our our curly
01:04 - brackets in rounded parentheses we
01:06 - create curly brackets now I'm going to
01:09 - specify a URL and this is going to be
01:11 - page dot HTML and I'm going to come and
01:16 - separate that with success and this is
01:20 - going to be a function and the function
01:23 - contents is going to make use of the
01:26 - data that's returned from this from this
01:29 - page ie the content which will be some
01:32 - content and then what we're going to do
01:34 - is we're going to apply this to the div
01:35 - just here so the Content ID div so I'm
01:39 - going to I'm going to select that div
01:43 - which is called content and then I'm
01:45 - going to apply the HTML code to there or
01:49 - in this case it's just plain text ok so
01:53 - let's go ahead and run this and see what
01:55 - result we get we taking the data from
01:58 - page to HTML and applying it to the
02:00 - content div so everything should work ok
02:03 - so you can see some content ok so now
02:06 - what happens if we were to change this
02:08 - so it didn't exist so page wonder HTM
02:11 - let's refresh click load you'll see that
02:14 - nothing happens so what we can actually
02:16 - do is we can use the status code
02:22 - property I guess of age of this Ajax
02:25 - request and actually return errors based
02:27 - on the status code that's returned so
02:30 - all we need to do is write status code
02:32 - so with a capital C and then after this
02:35 - we need more square brackets and I'll
02:38 - bring this down and go ahead and indent
02:42 - that in a bit now we're going to say 404
02:45 - so this is the error that we that we are
02:47 - looking out for and if we do have a 404
02:50 - error we create a new function here with
02:53 - the block and then we can do something
02:55 - depending on whether the pages and found
02:58 - or not for example so in that case I'm
03:01 - going to place some data into the
03:03 - content con let's just spell that
03:06 - quickly content dot HTML I'm going to
03:09 - say just a page not found so what's
03:15 - happening now is we're attempting to
03:17 - open page to HTML we're checking for a
03:19 - status code if we have a status code 404
03:22 - we're creating a function and the
03:24 - contents of that function is to apply
03:26 - the text page not found in fact we can
03:29 - go ahead and change this to text the
03:31 - text page not found in to the content
03:33 - div here otherwise if we have a success
03:38 - we can we're returning this data which
03:41 - is the contents of page to HTML and
03:43 - applying that to the contents div so
03:46 - let's go ahead and save that out we've
03:48 - automatically now got page to HTML back
03:51 - up remove the 1 so that successfully
03:53 - loads or should successfully load our
03:57 - page let's go ahead and
04:02 - refresh this page okay so for some
04:06 - reason it doesn't seem to be loading in
04:09 - okay so yeah if we just place a comma
04:12 - after this two comma separate that from
04:14 - the success then that should now work so
04:18 - a slight error there on my part so click
04:20 - load and some content is loaded now we
04:23 - can go ahead and change page to page one
04:26 - now this page is not going to be found
04:28 - so we're going to return a 404 status
04:31 - code error and then therefore we're
04:33 - going to play some text page not found
04:35 - inside of our content div let's go ahead
04:38 - and refresh and try that
04:39 - so click load page not found so you can
04:43 - add more status codes down here if you'd
04:46 - like so what you can do is go ahead and
04:48 - comment separate these as well so where
04:51 - any other status code that you'd like to
04:53 - display for example I'll just put zero
04:56 - zero zero to demonstrate it you then go
04:58 - ahead and create a new function and then
05:01 - you would use exactly the same code that
05:06 - we've just used there so you can handle
05:07 - different status codes in different ways
05:09 - so this is extremely useful if you want
05:12 - to relay back to your user that a
05:14 - particular page that is trying to be
05:16 - accessed can't be found as well as other
05:18 - error codes that might relate to more
05:19 - server related errors
