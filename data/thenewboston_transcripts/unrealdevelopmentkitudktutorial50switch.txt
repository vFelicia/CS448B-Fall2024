00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 50th wow this is like a milestone a 50th
00:05 - udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:07 - going to be teaching you guys how to use
00:09 - the switch action in unreal Kismet so
00:12 - before I continue I want to tell you
00:14 - guys that I did jump back into our old
00:16 - map um if you remember this map let me
00:19 - just go ahead and play it this is the
00:21 - map that I think I taught you guys how
00:23 - to use announcements so whenever you go
00:26 - up to the switch box and hit e it plays
00:28 - a sound and it says is awesome like a
00:31 - Hos so if we go ahead and actually take
00:33 - a look at the coding for this we go
00:35 - ahead and use the trigger and I taught
00:36 - you guys how to use this announcement
00:38 - right here so again remember this
00:40 - trigger isn't a contact trigger we
00:42 - actually have to go up to it and hit e
00:45 - rather than you know just running or
00:46 - bumping into it so let me go ahead and
00:49 - first disconnect this wire right here
00:51 - and position this right over there now
00:54 - remember this announcement just says
00:56 - Bucky is awesome like a Hos right on the
00:58 - screen so if I just go ahead and hit
01:00 - contrl C to copy this and paste that two
01:04 - more times I can get two more
01:06 - announcements that both say the same
01:08 - thing however I want this announcement
01:11 - to
01:11 - say Bucky is awesome like a Hos and this
01:14 - next one to say
01:17 - um but he's not as awesome as n Portman
01:23 - and make sure you spell that wrong and
01:25 - for this last one I'll just put dot dot
01:28 - dot or is he
01:30 - again this uh little story doesn't have
01:32 - to make sense I just want something to
01:35 - go kind of in a sequential pattern I
01:37 - could put one two and three but you know
01:40 - one two and three come on that's boring
01:42 - who does that so now let me go ahead and
01:44 - control all and drag and actually move
01:47 - these over because in the middle I'm
01:49 - going to be adding something called a
01:51 - switch oh you don't believe me do you
01:54 - well let me go ahead and do that right
01:55 - now go ahead and right click and hit new
01:58 - action had a swallow there and if you go
02:01 - under switch you're going to find
02:03 - something called a switch H who would
02:06 - have thought to look there now let me
02:08 - explain to you guys what a switch
02:10 - is you know how I told you guys before
02:13 - that a single event can cause a single
02:16 - action well what if this event can make
02:20 - each one of these actions happen well we
02:23 - know we could do this used in used in
02:27 - used in then if we hit that switch all
02:30 - of these would play at the exact same
02:32 - time but that is not the effect we're
02:34 - going for so let me go ahead and
02:35 - disconnect that what I want is the very
02:38 - first time I hit this switch then I want
02:41 - this to happen the next time I hit it I
02:44 - want this to happen the next time I hit
02:47 - it I want this to happen and that's
02:49 - exactly what a switch action does so the
02:53 - first thing we notice is that it only
02:55 - has one
02:56 - input but it also only has one output
02:59 - output so what one of these am I
03:02 - supposed to plug into well first of all
03:04 - we need to give it more outputs so if
03:06 - you go ahead and look at the properties
03:08 - for switch you're going to see something
03:10 - called a link count under this SEC act
03:13 - switch so now let me go ahead and put
03:16 - this link count to three this basically
03:18 - means how many different options do you
03:20 - want to link to so the first time I hit
03:23 - the switch it's going to go ahead and
03:25 - play this one if I hit it a second time
03:28 - it's going to play this one and if I hit
03:30 - it a third time it's going to go ahead
03:32 - and play this one so now that's it that
03:36 - all there is to it so let going go ahead
03:37 - and X Out of This hit play from here and
03:40 - check it out I'm going to run up to my
03:42 - control
03:43 - panel and now I'm going to hit e and
03:46 - it's going to say Bucky is awesome like
03:48 - a hos if I hit again it says but he's
03:52 - not as awesome as Natalie propman I'm
03:54 - going just spel Portman right there now
03:56 - let me hit it one last time and it says
03:59 - or is
04:01 - he it's kind of like a evil question
04:03 - right at the end there so now actually
04:05 - for the fun of it let me go ahead and
04:06 - hit this one more time can you hear me
04:08 - clicking my keyboard click click click
04:10 - click click click click yeah that's what
04:12 - sound my keyboard makes weird huh so
04:15 - nothing's happening it doesn't loop back
04:17 - or anything so maybe that's the effect
04:19 - we're going for maybe we just want the
04:21 - user to read through those messages one
04:23 - time and never again but if we do want
04:26 - to Loop it back let me show you guys
04:27 - this property if we go ahead and hit
04:30 - this switch we have looping right here
04:34 - disabled nothing is in that checkbox but
04:36 - if we go ahead and check it then
04:38 - whenever we're done cycling through the
04:40 - switch it goes up and it hits number one
04:43 - again and it Loops through forever and
04:44 - ever so now let me go ahead and X Out of
04:47 - This hit play from here and check it
04:50 - out e Bucky is awesome like a Hos but
04:54 - he's not as awesome as Natalie propman
04:57 - or is he and hit it again again Bucky's
05:00 - awesome but he's not or is he I can do
05:04 - this all day if I wanted to so I'm not
05:07 - GNA waste your time with that so
05:08 - basically that's want to exp that's what
05:10 - I want to explain to you guys a switch
05:12 - is something that it's basically a way
05:15 - that a single event can cause multiple
05:18 - actions to happen one after another
05:22 - basically if you just look at this then
05:24 - you guys can see what's going on a lot
05:26 - better than me explaining it however at
05:28 - the beginning stor my guess is whenever
05:31 - you came across switch then you guys
05:33 - might have been a little confused by the
05:34 - wording because whenever you think of
05:36 - switch you think on and off and you
05:38 - don't think it through looping through a
05:40 - list so hopefully you guys understand
05:43 - what a switch is now and how to use it
05:44 - so thank you guys for watching don't
05:46 - forget to subscribe and don't forget to
05:48 - donate $2 million to me on my website so
05:50 - uh what what was that last thing I said
05:52 - oh don't worry about that so I'll see
05:54 - you next video
