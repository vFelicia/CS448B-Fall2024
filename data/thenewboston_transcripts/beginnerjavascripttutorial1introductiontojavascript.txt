00:00 - what is going on guys my name is bucky
00:02 - roberts and welcome to your very first
00:04 - javascript tutorial now for those of you
00:07 - who have no idea what javascript is
00:09 - javascript is basically a scripting
00:11 - language used to make web pages more
00:14 - interactive so for example if you have a
00:16 - web page and you maybe want to add a
00:19 - calculator to it or maybe you want to
00:20 - put a quiz on it or maybe you just want
00:23 - to have a navigation bar with some cool
00:25 - rollover buttons well in order to do
00:27 - this you need to use a special language
00:30 - called javascript and that's what i'm
00:32 - going to be teaching you guys but before
00:34 - i begin and we start typing javascript
00:37 - you guys need a couple things first the
00:39 - first thing you need is a text editor
00:42 - now any text editor will work fine but
00:45 - i'm going to use one called notepad plus
00:47 - plus now if you don't have this you can
00:49 - go ahead google and download it it's
00:52 - actually free and it's actually the one
00:53 - i recommend it's the best it's awesome
00:56 - again
00:57 - notepad
00:58 - plus plus go ahead type that into google
01:00 - and you'll be good to go
01:03 - another thing that you guys are going to
01:04 - need is a knowledge of xhtml and that's
01:07 - what this is right here if you guys
01:09 - don't know how to create a basic web
01:11 - page in xhtml then you need to watch
01:14 - that series first i made a xhtml and css
01:18 - tutorial series before this so if you
01:21 - don't know how to create a basic webpage
01:22 - go ahead and watch that it's on my
01:24 - youtube channel as well as on my website
01:27 - thenewboston.com so anyways
01:29 - once you have those two things
01:31 - then welcome to the world of javascript
01:35 - so let's go ahead and for all you guys
01:37 - let's begin
01:39 - me take a deep breath and get ready and
01:42 - let's go so like i said javascript is
01:45 - something that you add to web pages in
01:47 - order to make it more interactive so
01:50 - just like everything else in xhtml you
01:53 - need to add javascript through the use
01:55 - of tags now the tag for javascript is
01:58 - called
01:59 - s-c-r-i-p-t script now let me mention
02:03 - this
02:04 - in the internet there are a lot of
02:06 - different scripts that you can add to
02:08 - web pages there's javascript actually
02:11 - there's like 50 different types of
02:13 - scripting languages javascript is just
02:15 - one of them so
02:17 - when our browser comes across this code
02:19 - we need to tell explicitly that we're
02:21 - going to be working with javascript so
02:24 - in order to tell our browser that we
02:25 - need to give it an attribute called type
02:27 - and we set this equal to text slash
02:30 - javascript
02:32 - go ahead and end that and go ahead and
02:35 - add an ending script tag and in between
02:38 - these tags is where you're going to be
02:39 - typing all of your javascript code so
02:42 - that is javascript code it's not really
02:44 - but you know that's my example and in
02:46 - between here like i said all of our
02:49 - coding is going to be done
02:51 - so let's go ahead and actually let's
02:53 - write a real simple program right now um
02:56 - go ahead and copy me
02:58 - document dot
03:00 - right and inside parentheses with a
03:02 - semicolon at the end add quotation marks
03:04 - and write like hey now brown cow
03:07 - now i know you guys don't understand
03:09 - what this document right why we had
03:11 - parentheses or why we even have a
03:13 - semicolon at the end but for now i just
03:16 - want to make sure that javascript is set
03:18 - up in your browser and you're able to
03:20 - run it so let's go ahead and save this
03:22 - and go ahead and you can press
03:25 - run
03:26 - launch in chrome launching ie launch in
03:28 - whatever browser you want
03:31 - so let me go ahead and move this back
03:32 - and check out what we got
03:34 - hey now brown cow so as you can see
03:37 - javascript is working in my browser if
03:40 - anything like that pops up in your
03:42 - browser that means that well you're
03:44 - probably at school and they tried to
03:45 - block youtube or you know something so
03:48 - they probably took javascript off your
03:50 - browsers but anyways um make sure that
03:52 - you have javascript set up so if you see
03:55 - this that means you're good to go if you
03:56 - get an error message or don't see this
03:58 - at all that means that it's not working
04:01 - in your browser and you need to fix that
04:03 - so with that being said let me mention
04:05 - one more thing
04:08 - a lot of the older browsers like you
04:11 - know when they first started making the
04:13 - internet and web pages a lot of the
04:15 - browsers didn't understand javascript
04:17 - their main job was just to understand a
04:18 - basic html web page so whenever they try
04:21 - to read a program like this it's just
04:23 - going to come across and be like whoa
04:25 - what the heck is this i don't know so
04:27 - i'm just going to go ahead and
04:29 - type out what's ever in there and we
04:31 - want hey now brown cow to type out on
04:33 - our webpage we don't want this whole
04:35 - long string of text right here so if
04:37 - it's you know typing out something weird
04:39 - or something other than hey now brown
04:41 - cow that may be the issue is that you
04:43 - have an older browser and it doesn't
04:46 - understand what javascript is
04:48 - so anyways if you know that you're going
04:50 - to be making a webpage using javascript
04:52 - and a lot of people with older computers
04:55 - are going to be looking at it or if you
04:56 - know that your viewers have older
04:58 - browsers you might want to add a little
05:00 - safety check in order to protect against
05:03 - older browsers from trying to read this
05:05 - javascript go ahead and put the greater
05:07 - than sign or is that the less than sign
05:09 - i think that's a less than sign
05:11 - explanation point minus minus
05:13 - and when you're done with your
05:14 - javascript go ahead and press forward
05:17 - forward slash minus minus greater than
05:19 - sign
05:20 - now
05:21 - whenever older browsers come across this
05:23 - it's going to think that this is just a
05:25 - comment and it's just going to ignore it
05:27 - basically so go ahead and save this and
05:30 - refresh and see what we get you can see
05:32 - that since this is a new browser it's
05:34 - going to know not to ignore and it's
05:36 - going to be smart enough to know that
05:37 - this is indeed javascript but if i had
05:39 - an old browser it wouldn't type anything
05:41 - at all so that's a nice little safety
05:43 - check that you can use against older
05:45 - browsers
05:47 - it's going to work with or without it
05:49 - but for the sake of this tutorial since
05:51 - i know that i'm going to be using a new
05:52 - browser i'm going to go ahead and delete
05:54 - them because i mean we only have so much
05:56 - space here and that's just taking up
05:58 - space but anyways it's common practice
06:01 - or
06:02 - it's good practice to include those
06:04 - whenever you're typing javascript so i'm
06:06 - not but you might want to personal
06:08 - preference
06:09 - so anyways
06:10 - well that's probably all i need to teach
06:12 - you guys for this tutorial in the next
06:14 - tutorial we're probably going to be
06:15 - talking about comments and variables so
06:17 - anyways
06:18 - go ahead and uh you know just get
06:20 - javascript set up go ahead and include
06:23 - these tags and make sure that you uh you
06:25 - know try to test out this line of code
06:27 - and trust me i know you guys don't
06:29 - understand what's going on right now but
06:31 - now that you're set up you're ready to
06:33 - move on to the next tutorial so anyways
06:35 - thank you guys for watching uh don't
06:36 - forget to subscribe to my videos and i
06:38 - will see you guys well in the next
