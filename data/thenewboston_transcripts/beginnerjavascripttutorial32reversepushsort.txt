00:00 - what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - your 302 JavaScript tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial I'm going to be talking about
00:07 - the last array methods now there are a
00:10 - couple more that I didn't cover but
00:12 - these are the most basic ones most
00:14 - well-known and also the ones that you're
00:16 - going to be working with the most often
00:18 - so if you want to uh learn all of them
00:21 - then I don't know go on like the website
00:23 - for Java scripter rise or something but
00:25 - for now I think this is all I need to
00:27 - cover so in this tutorial I'm going to
00:29 - be teaching you about the reverse push
00:32 - and sort methods so before we get into
00:34 - that we actually need an array and I'm
00:36 - going to make an array of body parts so
00:39 - I'm just going to name it BP because you
00:42 - know way too lazy to type out body parts
00:44 - so let's go ahead and put like
00:48 - Head
00:50 - Shoulders Knees and can you guess toes
00:54 - head shoulders knees and toes knees and
00:57 - toes anyways so the first thing I'm
01:00 - going to be teaching about is called the
01:02 - reverse method and what this does is you
01:04 - take your
01:05 - array and you reverse it it doesn't take
01:08 - any parameters because you're just
01:09 - reversing it so now our BP array is toes
01:13 - knees shoulders and head as opposed to
01:16 - head shoulds head shoulders knees and
01:18 - toes so I'm not going to print it out
01:20 - because trust me it reversed it just
01:23 - believe me so aside from that the next
01:26 - method I want to show you guys is
01:28 - something called the push method now the
01:31 - push method is kind of the opposite as
01:33 - Pop of Pop you know how pop took the
01:36 - last element and removed it from the end
01:38 - of your array what the push method does
01:41 - is it adds element onto the end of your
01:43 - array so you can either add one element
01:46 - or multiple elements so for example if
01:49 - you wanted to add one element on the end
01:50 - of your array you would
01:52 - push one element on like tongue and this
01:57 - would add tongue to the end of your
01:58 - array if you want wanted to add another
02:00 - one you can either call this method
02:02 - again or you can just separate it with a
02:05 - parameter and add another body part to
02:07 - the end of your array so what this would
02:09 - do is add these elements onto the end of
02:12 - your array simple enough so the last
02:15 - method I want to talk to you guys about
02:17 - that I'm going to introduce is called
02:18 - the sort method and all this does is it
02:22 - takes all your elements in your array
02:24 - and it sorts them in alphabetical order
02:27 - so no matter if you're reverse them push
02:30 - them there what you did before this is
02:33 - now going to take all these elements and
02:36 - sort them out an alphabetical order and
02:38 - replace them in your array so what I'm
02:41 - going to do now is I'm going to print
02:43 - this out on the screen and by the time
02:47 - I'm doing this and by the time I'm done
02:49 - writing this code I want you guys to see
02:51 - if you can type all these in
02:53 - alphabetical order so let me see if I
02:55 - can code this or you can type it faster
02:57 - so Ready Set Go
03:01 - string one equals BP
03:05 - join crap crap I'm getting too nervous
03:08 - BP
03:10 - join
03:12 - document right wow if you guys don't win
03:15 - then that is embarrassing document right
03:18 - string one now let me go ahead save
03:21 - refresh and Bam so I'm guessing that
03:25 - since I was incredibly slow I think I
03:27 - took like 20 seconds that is what you
03:29 - got should have guessed so if you can um
03:32 - sort this manually faster than I can
03:35 - then that's embarrassing if I didn't
03:37 - have like 8,000 typos then you know
03:39 - maybe I'd stand a chance but anyways now
03:42 - that I just raised you guys let me
03:43 - explain what I just did what I did is I
03:45 - joined them and remember what this
03:47 - method does it takes your array and it
03:49 - converts it to a string separated by a
03:52 - comma and it stored that in the variable
03:54 - string one and then all I did is I wrote
03:57 - string one on the screen so that's how I
04:00 - got this so basically we reversed it we
04:04 - pushed two elements on and then it
04:06 - sorted it so basically reversing it did
04:09 - nothing but anyways we did it anyways so
04:11 - we basically added two elements into
04:13 - this array and we sorted it
04:15 - alphabetically and as you can see now
04:18 - this array is in alphabetical order h k
04:20 - l stt so that's alphabetical order there
04:24 - you go so that's all I have for you guys
04:27 - for different array methods um like said
04:29 - there are more array methods but I'm not
04:31 - going to be talking about all of them
04:33 - with you guys so that's all I have for
04:35 - you guys for this tutorial in next
04:36 - tutorial we're probably going to be
04:38 - talking more about arrays but I promise
04:40 - we're done with array methods for now so
04:43 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
04:44 - to subscribe and I'll see you next video
