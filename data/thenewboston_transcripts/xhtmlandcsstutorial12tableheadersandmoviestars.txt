00:01 - what is up people how y'all doing today
00:03 - welcome back to your let's see what this
00:05 - is 12th xhtml tutorial I always go let's
00:09 - see what this is or what number is it I
00:11 - probably should uh just you know think
00:13 - about what number it is before I start
00:15 - talking but you know uh I didn't so
00:17 - anyways on with the tutorial in this
00:20 - tutorial I said we're going to be
00:21 - talking a little more about tables and I
00:25 - meant it because in this tutorial we're
00:27 - going to be learning about table headers
00:29 - now a header for your table is pretty
00:32 - much a title that you can put for each
00:34 - column so if you just have a table with
00:36 - a bunch of data in it people might be
00:39 - confused be like are these addresses or
00:41 - are they phone numbers or are they names
00:42 - of people or street names I need a title
00:45 - to tell me what each row means or excuse
00:48 - me what each column means so in order to
00:50 - do that we need to create table headers
00:53 - so in order to create table headers we
00:55 - first need a table so let's go ahead and
00:57 - make a table with the Border of
01:00 - one and put the ending table so we don't
01:03 - forget it later
01:05 - on and inside our table let's just go
01:08 - ahead and make uh three rows so table
01:13 - row table row and let's go ahead and
01:16 - copy this actually let's go ahead and
01:17 - indent this make it easier to read and
01:21 - copy this and paste and paste so now we
01:24 - have a table with three rows in it and
01:26 - let's go ahead and space out these rows
01:28 - this is going to make it easier
01:31 - read and inside the first row what we
01:35 - want to do is let's say we want to make
01:37 - a web page of the girls that I think are
01:40 - awesome and beautiful seems like an
01:42 - appropriate topic so let's go ahead and
01:44 - add our first header at the top now in
01:47 - order to make a header it's th this
01:50 - stands for table header and these are
01:51 - going to be the headers for your columns
01:54 - so anything that you put in a header is
01:56 - not going to be like a regular table
01:58 - data it's going to be bold and Center so
02:01 - these are perfect for making the titles
02:03 - you're going to see later on how awesome
02:04 - they are so let's go ahead and make
02:06 - three of them um we'll have three
02:08 - columns in this table we'll have the
02:10 - name of the girl and I'll write a movie
02:15 - that they played in I'll pick movie
02:16 - stars and write the person who they love
02:20 - right there so I'm going to have their
02:22 - name a movie that they played in and
02:24 - someone that they love in the third
02:26 - column so let's go ahead and in our
02:29 - first row we'll make our first go girl
02:32 - um remember you need table data for this
02:34 - because this is just regular data
02:36 - information so let me go ahead and um
02:40 - copy
02:41 - this so now we have three bits of data
02:45 - the first one is the name and the first
02:46 - girl that is awesome is
02:50 - Natalie Portman even though she's prer
02:52 - right now best of luck Natalie and a
02:54 - movie that she played in Garden State if
02:57 - you guys never saw it I would highly
02:58 - recommend checking it out out and the
03:00 - person that they love let's just go
03:02 - ahead and put Bucky because you know I'm
03:04 - pretty irresistible if I don't say
03:06 - myself so let's go ahead and take all
03:08 - this data copy it and put it into our
03:10 - next row but we can't just stress the
03:13 - fact how much n Portman loves me because
03:16 - I mean we all know that so let's go
03:17 - ahead and pick a new girl and that would
03:22 - be Rachel
03:25 - McAdams and that's the girl who played
03:27 - in The Notebook and uh mean girl
03:32 - um she played I think Regina in Mean
03:34 - Girls Don't ask me how I know that just
03:36 - uh you know just let it slide and who
03:39 - she loves oh yeah we'll just leave that
03:40 - Bucky for now so and go ahead and save
03:43 - that and refresh this and check it out
03:46 - the name this is your table header right
03:49 - now and you can see a table header is
03:51 - different cuz a it's centered all these
03:54 - are left Justified and this is centered
03:56 - and also they're bold so they stand out
03:59 - so now when someone looks at this table
04:01 - they won't see just random information
04:03 - but they can see what each column means
04:05 - it's a lot easier to read and a lot
04:07 - easier to follow so yeah this actually
04:10 - looks like a pretty accurate table so um
04:12 - I'm just going to leave it like that and
04:14 - I'm going to publish this and yeah we're
04:17 - good to go so anyways that's the basics
04:19 - of how you make a header for your table
04:22 - and also place it above table data and
04:26 - also some little insight into movie
04:28 - stars and who they love so thank you
