00:00 - hi this is alex from phpacademy.org with
00:03 - a video tutorial for the new boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at the progress bar widget
00:09 - in jquery ui
00:12 - now the progress bar is essentially a
00:15 - a bar that can contain a specific value
00:18 - and it's filled to that value so any
00:21 - really
00:21 - normal progress bar you've seen we're
00:24 - essentially going to
00:25 - simulate this in the tutorial
00:28 - so the first thing i've done is i've
00:30 - included obviously jquery and jquery ui
00:33 - as well as this css file which is under
00:36 - the ui lightness theme
00:39 - there's more details on how to install
00:41 - themes
00:42 - sorry on how to install uh jquery ui in
00:45 - the installing jq uh jquery ui video
00:48 - i've created in this series
00:52 - so essentially what we're doing in this
00:54 - tutorial is we're gonna be creating a
00:56 - progress bar and then a progress
00:58 - percentage underneath and that's going
01:01 - to feed back the value that the
01:03 - percentage bar will be currently at
01:06 - and then when we get to the end of the
01:08 - percentage i.e 100 we're going to stop
01:11 - the progress bar
01:13 - now obviously with the progress bar in
01:15 - place you can't actually create a
01:18 - process on its own you would have to
01:20 - have some kind of script
01:22 - that would feed back a value of the
01:23 - percentage that it's currently at for
01:26 - example a file upload or something
01:28 - similar so you're going to have to
01:30 - actually have something that gives you
01:32 - the value before you implement it into
01:34 - this progress bar
01:36 - now obviously because we're just taking
01:38 - a look at the widget itself we're not
01:40 - actually going to be able to create a
01:42 - real percentage
01:44 - um and we're not going to be able to
01:45 - generate a real percentage from a
01:47 - particular place
01:49 - so what we're going to have to do is
01:50 - we're going to have to use the set
01:52 - interval function and actually create
01:55 - this uh as an effect rather than an
01:57 - actual function
01:59 - however what you will do is you'll learn
02:01 - how to implement the progress bar and
02:03 - also display the feedback based on this
02:05 - so we're going to be creating a small
02:06 - application that's going to be dealing
02:08 - with this
02:11 - so the first thing we're going to do is
02:12 - we're going to create a button which is
02:14 - going to activate this progress bar from
02:16 - 0 to 100 so let's go ahead and first of
02:19 - all create a button
02:22 - that's going to have a value of let's
02:24 - just say start or let's just uh call it
02:27 - upload to make it more practical more
02:29 - look more practical
02:31 - and the
02:32 - input id we're just going to have upload
02:35 - just so we can reference this in ui.js
02:37 - our jquery or our javascript external
02:40 - file
02:41 - the next thing to do is create a div
02:43 - that's going to handle the actual
02:46 - progress bar itself so i'm just going to
02:47 - call this pb
02:49 - and then underneath that we want a div
02:51 - that's going to relay the percentage of
02:54 - the bar to us so i'm going to call this
02:56 - percent
02:58 - okay so now that we've done that we can
02:59 - go ahead and create an event handler to
03:01 - handle a particular event which will be
03:04 - the starting of this progress bar and
03:06 - percentage when we click the upload
03:08 - button so inside ui.js
03:11 - we want to go ahead and reference this
03:13 - upload here so we are creating a
03:15 - selector to select upload and the event
03:18 - is on click or dot click
03:21 - so after this we're going to create a
03:22 - function and inside here is going to be
03:24 - our function contents
03:27 - so now once we've clicked this button we
03:29 - want to actually activate the progress
03:31 - bar we're first of all going to take a
03:32 - look at how
03:33 - this works
03:35 - and how it's implemented and then we'll
03:37 - look at changing the value dynamically
03:40 - so to do this we're going to need to use
03:42 - a selector to select the progress bar
03:44 - div that we created on our page and we
03:46 - want to apply the progress bar widget to
03:50 - this
03:51 - okay so now what that's going to have
03:52 - done is it's going to select it's going
03:54 - to have create created a progress bar
03:56 - when we click upload let's go ahead and
03:57 - click upload and you can see that we've
03:59 - created this long massive progress bar
04:01 - across the page
04:03 - now i'm going to go ahead and set a few
04:04 - settings inside star.css which we have
04:07 - implemented into this page and that's
04:09 - just going to make everything look a bit
04:11 - nicer
04:12 - so the first thing i'm going to do is
04:13 - set the text size of the body
04:17 - and i'm going to set that or sorry font
04:19 - size
04:20 - i'm going to set that to 12 pixels and
04:23 - i'm then going to change the
04:25 - width of this progress bar div as well
04:27 - so we reference pb
04:30 - and we set the width here and we'll give
04:32 - it a width of 400 pixels so now it looks
04:35 - like this it's slightly smaller and it
04:38 - fits nicely just under here
04:40 - okay so um
04:44 - let's go ahead and change a value of
04:46 - this progress bar to see what it looks
04:48 - like when we actually have it say half
04:50 - full so we can supply an option inside
04:54 - of the progress bar widget to allow us
04:56 - to set the value so for now i'm going to
04:58 - set the value to 50. now if the value
05:01 - set to 50 when we click upload this is
05:03 - going to go to halfway because we've
05:05 - defined the value as 50.
05:08 - so now if you logically think about it
05:10 - we could set this value here to a vec to
05:13 - a slowly or an increasing uh value
05:18 - so essentially what we could do is we
05:20 - could replace this with another variable
05:22 - for example val
