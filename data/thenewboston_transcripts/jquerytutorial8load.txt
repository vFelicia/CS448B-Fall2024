00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to be taking a
00:07 - look at the load event handler and how
00:10 - we use it in document loading now if I
00:13 - was to go ahead and use document load we
00:16 - know that that allows us to know when
00:20 - the Dom has been loaded and we can start
00:24 - you know manipulating different elements
00:27 - on a page or anything on a page however
00:31 - if we were to go ahead and look at the
00:33 - example of a large image with a slightly
00:35 - larger file size let's say we wanted to
00:37 - take an image and know when an image had
00:40 - been loaded into the dom so the first
00:43 - thing I'm going to do is go ahead and
00:45 - outline this image in fact let's take a
00:48 - look at this in comparison to document
00:50 - load so I'm going to go ahead and just
00:55 - create some content on a page so we'll
00:57 - just say content so now on our page we
00:59 - have this when we go into ext GS which
01:04 - I've included on my page just here so
01:07 - that's that scripts included as an
01:08 - external file we can often use document
01:12 - dot ready and then here we can define a
01:16 - function for when our document is ready
01:19 - so for example show a dialog box like
01:23 - alert or an alert box saying ready so we
01:29 - have this alert box up now when our DOM
01:33 - is available now let's just go ahead and
01:36 - take a look at a larger image if we were
01:40 - to have say an image here that would say
01:45 - Berlin jpg and we're just going to go
01:49 - ahead and assign a oh no we won't assign
01:52 - an ID to it quite yet but we'll go ahead
01:54 - and use document dot ready with a
01:58 - function inside that will run when our
02:01 - document is loaded so this is going to
02:03 - be alert ready
02:06 - now when i refresh my page this in this
02:08 - image is about one or two megabytes in
02:11 - file size so you'll notice that the
02:13 - alert box will appear instantly even
02:16 - before the image has loaded let's go
02:18 - ahead and refresh you can see that we
02:20 - have this alert box appear our image in
02:25 - the background hasn't loaded it hasn't
02:27 - even begun to load so now when I press
02:29 - ok you can see that the image the rest
02:32 - of the image begins to load and we now
02:35 - have this image inside of our browser
02:38 - now let's go ahead and take a look at
02:42 - what's going to happen if we want this
02:43 - to happen after the image has loaded so
02:47 - we can either go ahead and use window
02:49 - dot ready which is in another tutorial
02:51 - and I'll talk about that in another
02:53 - tutorial or we can assign an ID to a
02:56 - particular element that we want to check
02:58 - for loading and this can be applied to
03:01 - iframes images etc etc so I'm just going
03:05 - to call this image image so I'm going to
03:07 - give an ID of image now inside ext is
03:12 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
03:13 - select this particular image so image
03:16 - dot but I'm this time I'm going to use
03:18 - load so we're looking at the load event
03:21 - handler and then going to go ahead and
03:24 - define the function inside of this and
03:26 - just bring it down so what we've done is
03:29 - we've we're essentially checking when
03:31 - this image this this object or this
03:33 - element in our page has loaded we then
03:37 - run some code so we can run again alert
03:40 - image load it
03:44 - so now what we're doing is instead of
03:46 - using document.ready we're checking when
03:48 - a particular item has been loaded so in
03:52 - this case we're going to say image
03:54 - loaded when this image is loaded so if
03:57 - we go back to here and refresh the page
03:59 - you can see that the page is actually
04:02 - refreshed and the image was loaded in
04:04 - the background very quickly because it
04:06 - will already be present in my browser
04:09 - cache so now we have this image loaded
04:13 - alert box come up but the image had
04:17 - already loaded before this had happened
04:19 - so let's just take an example if you
04:22 - wanted to go ahead and perform some kind
04:24 - of you know jQuery operation on an image
04:28 - for alignment purposes or whatever you
04:31 - want to do you're looking at making sure
04:35 - the image loads before you start this
04:37 - code so for example you could say image
04:41 - load and then you could go ahead and
04:44 - apply some code directly that to do with
04:46 - the image so you'd want the image to
04:48 - load before you'd be able to perform
04:50 - anything on the image you know anything
04:53 - to do with the image so using the load
04:56 - on a particular element is helpful
04:59 - because you can then go ahead and
05:02 - actually wait for an element to be
05:03 - loaded and like I said this can be
05:06 - applied to other things such as iframes
05:09 - so for example if you had an iframe here
05:14 - go ahead and outline this and then you
05:18 - had the source of this being for example
05:22 - Google
05:25 - what you then do is you would come in
05:27 - here and you could obviously assign an
05:30 - ID to this iframe and we'll just call
05:34 - this iframe and we could then go ahead
05:37 - and just reference this as iframe load
05:41 - and then we could say alert iframe load
05:47 - it so now when we go ahead and refresh
05:50 - we make sure that's loaded which it had
05:53 - before we got this dialog box up you'll
05:57 - probably notice that it did a bit of
05:58 - loading in here before that happened let
06:00 - me just refresh again you can see they
06:02 - all loaded before this happened we'll go
06:05 - ahead and select another website just so
06:08 - you can see that once more so let's go
06:11 - ahead and choose PHP academy' dorg now
06:15 - when i refresh that waits once it's
06:19 - loaded we see iframe loaded so now that
06:23 - we've looked at this we can go ahead and
06:25 - we could also apply that to for example
06:27 - all images on a page so you could say
06:31 - IMG road all images loaded so we're
06:38 - using a selector but we're selecting
06:40 - globally across the Dom all images so
06:44 - now what we could do is go ahead and
06:45 - apply an image
06:49 - in fact let's take a look back at the
06:52 - iframe example because this shows
06:54 - loading a lot better I'll go ahead and
06:56 - choose Google Code at UK and that's
07:05 - going for eBay dot code at UK just an
07:07 - example we can go ahead and get rid of
07:09 - these IDs because they're not they're
07:11 - not relevant in this case we're going to
07:13 - be selecting all iframes so iframe dot
07:18 - load all iframes loaded so now we're
07:24 - using selectors in this case to select
07:27 - all iframes and once they've all loaded
07:30 - we say all iframes loaded so this is
07:34 - going to take slightly longer than we've
07:36 - looked at before so when i refresh you
07:38 - can see that we it waits for all of all
07:40 - three of the contents to load before
07:43 - this happens I will it will happen for
07:45 - each one sorry so yeah as I've just said
07:50 - it happens for each iframe as each frame
07:54 - each iframe loads however we need to
07:57 - look at the possibility of checking if
08:00 - all of our elements have loaded rather
08:03 - than straight after the Dom has been
08:05 - initialized so in the next tutorial
08:09 - we're going to be taking a look at the
08:11 - alternative to this where we look at
08:14 - when all objects in the page have been
08:17 - loaded and then we can say go ahead and
08:20 - alert something out
