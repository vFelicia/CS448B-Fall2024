00:01 - last video we learned about right
00:03 - triangles in general and how their sides
00:05 - relate to one another but today we're
00:08 - just going to talk about special kinds
00:10 - of right triangles that have a different
00:14 - Association so an isoceles right
00:17 - triangle and remember an isoceles
00:20 - triangle has two congruent
00:25 - sides which would be this one and this
00:27 - one so that they have the same length so
00:30 - we're just going to call that length a
00:33 - well their
00:35 - hypotenuse which is across from the
00:39 - right
00:40 - angle is equal to that side times the
00:44 - sare < TK of
00:46 - 2 so that means that this length is
00:50 - square < TK of
00:52 - two so let's do an
00:55 - example we have this triangle and
01:01 - this angle is
01:04 - 45° so that means that using our
01:07 - Pythagorean theorem 45 + 90 + x = 180
01:19 - that X has to equal
01:23 - 45 not not side x just this angle
01:28 - X so
01:30 - that means that this and we know that
01:34 - this is an esles right triangle that
01:37 - this is congruent to this so that means
01:39 - that side x is equal to 4 and we're
01:44 - trying to find what Y is equal to and Y
01:47 - is the
01:49 - hypotenuse so we follow our Rule and we
01:52 - take
01:53 - four and multiply it by the square < TK
01:57 - of 2 to get the length of Y so y = 4un
02:02 - of
02:05 - 2 so now we're going to talk about
02:08 - another kind of triangle that has its
02:10 - own special rules as well it's called a
02:13 - 30 60 90 triangle and these numbers
02:17 - right here are the measures of the
02:19 - angles so it's a right triangle so it
02:21 - has to have a 90° angle which is right
02:25 - here
02:28 - and this angle there ° and this angle is
02:32 - 60°
02:34 - so
02:36 - this length right here is just
02:39 - a this hypotenuse is 2 * this
02:45 - side this side is a * the < TK of
02:50 - 3 and we're going to use those to find
02:54 - out what the length of each side of the
02:59 - right triangle
03:01 - angle so we know that
03:04 - this side is equal to five so that mean
03:09 - so that means
03:11 - that this angle is equal to
03:15 - 30°
03:17 - so the
03:19 - side
03:21 - opposite the 30°
03:24 - angle is
03:27 - five this side
03:30 - of opposite the 60° angle which is
03:36 - y is equal to a square < TK of 3 so
03:43 - right now A is equal to 5 because this
03:46 - side is equal to five so we're going to
03:48 - take five and multiply it by the sare <
03:51 - TK of 3 to find out what y equals so y =
03:55 - 5un of 3 and then we know that this side
04:01 - is equal to 2 *
04:06 - a which
04:09 - is so we just take
04:13 - 2 * 5 which is 10 so that means X is
04:18 - equal to
04:22 - 10 and those are the two
04:25 - special kinds of right
04:28 - triangles make sure to watch the next
04:30 - video where we're going to take all this
04:32 - information and use it to do right
04:36 - triangle trigonometry
