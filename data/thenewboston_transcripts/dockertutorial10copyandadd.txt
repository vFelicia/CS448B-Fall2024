00:00 - all righty guys welcome back to another
00:02 - video and in this tutorial
00:03 - i am gonna be teaching you guys how to
00:05 - use the copy and add keywords
00:07 - to move files from your local operating
00:10 - system your
00:11 - normal working environment into your
00:13 - image
00:14 - in that way the purpose of this and it's
00:16 - typically by the way source code that
00:18 - you're moving over
00:20 - but anyways the point of this is that
00:22 - whenever anyone else builds your
00:23 - container
00:24 - not only do they have all those services
00:26 - like postgres and redis
00:28 - but they have the actual source code as
00:30 - well like your html files your images
00:32 - so on and so forth the total package
00:36 - so just is a quick uh little
00:39 - prerequisite
00:40 - i created this temp2 directory and
00:42 - that's where i'm at right now
00:44 - in my command line and we have a couple
00:46 - assets in here we have this directory
00:48 - called corn
00:50 - which i already packed up into this tar
00:52 - file
00:53 - and then we have a directory called html
00:55 - files which has
00:56 - one apples.html file in it and then a
00:59 - sample text file
01:01 - nothing about these are like special i
01:04 - just wanted to have three different
01:05 - types of assets because
01:07 - the way that we move them over it's it's
01:09 - a little bit different so
01:11 - again it doesn't matter what they're
01:12 - named or you know what's actually in
01:14 - these text files
01:16 - just want to have these different ones
01:17 - to kind of demonstrate some different
01:18 - concepts
01:20 - all right so let's go ahead and get
01:22 - started of course
01:23 - since you know what we're trying to do
01:25 - is create an image from a docker file
01:27 - first thing we need is an actual docker
01:29 - file so i'm gonna go
01:31 - nano and create a docker file now the
01:34 - very first
01:35 - thing that we're gonna need is a base
01:36 - image and we'll just go with alpine
01:39 - since it's the most
01:40 - lightweight really doesn't matter for
01:41 - this tutorial but we'll stick with
01:42 - alpine
01:44 - now the keyword that we're going to be
01:46 - discussing first
01:47 - is the copy keyword now what the copy
01:49 - keyword
01:50 - is going to do is it's going to instruct
01:52 - docker to copy files or directories
01:55 - from the source i'll just uh
01:58 - make a little template there from the
02:01 - source location
02:02 - and this is the location on your local
02:05 - operating system your actual computer
02:07 - and it's going to be copying them over
02:09 - to the destination
02:10 - now the destination is the file system
02:13 - of the container
02:14 - or in other words the image that's going
02:16 - to become a container that we're going
02:17 - to be creating
02:18 - now the very first command i'm going to
02:19 - be showing you guys is actually not
02:21 - going to be part of our
02:22 - final product because it's going to kind
02:26 - of ruin the rest of my tutorial
02:27 - if i include this but i want to show it
02:29 - to you guys anyways because you're going
02:32 - to see this a lot
02:33 - and that is people typically or i don't
02:36 - want to say typically
02:37 - a common thing is to copy all of the
02:40 - content
02:41 - from the current directory over to a
02:43 - target folder
02:44 - so you might see something like this and
02:46 - what this means is
02:48 - take everything inside temp2 where we're
02:50 - at right now
02:52 - and copy over into an app directory in
02:55 - the image
02:56 - now again i don't want to do that
02:57 - because i want to show you some tricky
02:59 - things of copying
03:01 - files one by one so the first thing we
03:03 - actually
03:04 - are going to be doing is taking this
03:06 - html files directory
03:08 - and moving this into a app slash html
03:12 - so you guys can probably guess how you
03:13 - would do this copy
03:15 - again current directory forward slash
03:18 - html
03:19 - files and then i'm going to be copying
03:22 - over to app
03:23 - slash html so again it's going to take
03:27 - all the content from here and copy over
03:30 - to
03:31 - a new folder app slash html
03:34 - and that's where it's going to land up
03:35 - in our final image
03:37 - now if you ever want to copy over a
03:39 - single file then what you can do
03:41 - is well i'll show you guys it's pretty
03:44 - self-explanatory but walk you through
03:46 - it anyways so copy sample.txt
03:49 - over to app slash sample.txt
03:53 - so again what it's going to do is take
03:55 - this file and just move it to
03:57 - a new folder in our images file system
04:00 - and that location is app sample.txt
04:03 - plain and simple
04:04 - so copy copy take files from here move
04:07 - them over there
04:07 - okay i got it so what's the point of
04:09 - this ad keyword we were talking about
04:12 - so add is actually very similar to copy
04:15 - but it allows us to unpack tar files
04:18 - as well as use a url is the source
04:22 - so it's kind of like copy for um
04:25 - in special cases you can think of it
04:27 - like that a special use case of copy if
04:29 - you will
04:30 - so that is why in case you guys were
04:32 - wondering why i have this tar
04:34 - file because we need to add keyword for
04:36 - that so
04:38 - what i'm going to do is include add corn
04:41 - dot tar and we can just move that into
04:44 - our app directory as our target
04:48 - and last but not least and actually have
04:50 - this copied
04:51 - actually let me pull it up on a browser
04:53 - show you guys what's going on
04:56 - all right so i'm just gonna move this
04:57 - svg and this is just the logo of
04:59 - the new boss then bump it up so you guys
05:01 - can see
05:02 - and i just wanna what is this get out of
05:05 - here thing
05:06 - i just wanna show you guys this because
05:09 - i want to demonstrate the idea of
05:11 - taking a file from a url and including
05:14 - it in your image
05:15 - as well so what we're going to do in
05:18 - that case
05:18 - is just add and then all right so you
05:22 - guys can't see it but
05:23 - all of the uh the entire url is there my
05:26 - screen is just a little bit
05:27 - squished together so i can show it on my
05:29 - tutorial but we're going to take that
05:31 - url
05:32 - that svg file and copy it over to app
05:35 - images and i actually want to rename
05:37 - this one since i don't like that big
05:39 - long name
05:40 - of logo.svg alright
05:43 - so it looks like we have everything
05:45 - ported over and
05:47 - looks good to go so i'm just going to
05:49 - save that and just to show you guys the
05:51 - final product
05:52 - of all right so we have from alpine
05:56 - we're gonna copy over html files this
05:59 - one file
06:00 - and then again what this is gonna do
06:02 - right here is not only just copy this
06:04 - file directly
06:05 - but since we have the add keyword it's
06:07 - going to unpack that
06:09 - and then of course this is just showing
06:11 - that we can grab files from the internet
06:13 - as well
06:14 - so let's clear out in docker build
06:17 - period so docker build period and all
06:21 - right looking good
06:23 - now i'm just gonna get that id for
06:26 - docker image ls and it should be this
06:29 - top one
06:30 - and all right so let's run this
06:32 - container and
06:33 - see if it worked so docker run and we
06:36 - actually want to shell in so we can you
06:37 - know poke around
06:38 - navigate around and make sure that
06:40 - everything worked correctly and that was
06:42 - the
06:42 - id of the image and then i'm just gonna
06:46 - run shell is my default command and
06:49 - let's run
06:49 - ls la and see what we got
06:52 - all right so looks like we got that app
06:55 - folder which is good so let's navigate
06:57 - into that
06:58 - and if we run lsla here all right
07:02 - so first thing it looks like we did
07:04 - indeed copy over that
07:06 - sample.txt file correctly and now what i
07:09 - want to do is just navigate into corn
07:12 - and all right looks like we got corn one
07:15 - in corn two
07:16 - and if you see this this tar file was
07:19 - just
07:20 - this uh directory packed into a tar file
07:23 - and
07:23 - indeed it did have corn one and corn two
07:25 - in it
07:26 - and what else do we got over here so let
07:28 - me navigate
07:29 - out here all right we have
07:33 - html and let's navigate there
07:38 - all right so in html we do have
07:40 - apples.html indeed
07:43 - last but not least let's
07:46 - look in images so cd images
07:51 - and yes we have that logo svg
07:54 - so all right that and i'll pull this up
07:57 - so you guys have something to look at
07:59 - while i'm doing my little
08:00 - outro here but that is the difference
08:03 - between
08:03 - copy and add again both keywords that
08:06 - allow you to take
08:07 - files and folders from your local
08:09 - operating system
08:10 - and copy those over into your image that
08:13 - you can deploy whenever people run the
08:15 - container they can see all those
08:17 - very useful but yeah um
08:20 - nothing else to say really so uh thank
08:23 - you guys for watching don't forget to
08:24 - subscribe and i'll see you in the next
08:25 - video
