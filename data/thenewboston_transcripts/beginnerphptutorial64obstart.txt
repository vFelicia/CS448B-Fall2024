00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - with another video for the new Boston in
00:05 - the last tutorial we looked at the
00:08 - header function and how we can use it to
00:10 - change headers and we use the more
00:13 - common example of relocating a user to a
00:16 - specific page now we're faced with this
00:19 - problem where we have output before our
00:22 - page or before our PHP code therefore
00:25 - this header functions returning an error
00:27 - so let's just have another look at that
00:29 - we're saying cannot head a kind of
00:31 - modify header information headers
00:33 - already sent by this page and we're
00:37 - saying on line eight so we're calling
00:38 - this on line eight now there's a simple
00:41 - way to resolve this and to solve this
00:46 - problem we use a function called OB
00:49 - underscore star now this stands for
00:51 - output buffering start and what this
00:53 - function does is it turns out put
00:55 - buffering on now I'll show you how we
00:58 - write this in our program or our code
01:01 - rather and then I'll tell you a bit
01:03 - about the function and why we have to
01:05 - use it and what it does so I'm going to
01:09 - create some PHP tags as well up here
01:11 - before my output and also before the
01:14 - code that uses the header so this is
01:17 - going at the very very top of my page
01:19 - before any output and we use OB
01:22 - underscore start just cool simply on its
01:25 - own with no arguments applied you can
01:27 - also pull this up a bit so it looks a
01:29 - bit neater so it's all on one line
01:31 - okay so OB star will not output any and
01:36 - anything on the page what will it will
01:39 - but it will be the page output will be
01:43 - stored in an internal buffer rather than
01:46 - as headers so if we have some page
01:51 - content on here let's say my page this
01:54 - is my page let's just uh let's say
02:01 - redirect equals false so we don't do a
02:03 - redirect
02:06 - and let's run the page so before we have
02:10 - this cannot modify header information
02:12 - with a simple change up here ob start
02:15 - actually yet let's change this to true
02:17 - so we do redirect with a simple OB start
02:20 - called at the top when we refresh now
02:23 - our page is going to redirect so if
02:28 - you're receiving this error and that
02:29 - we've had before we use this let's just
02:32 - get rid of that if you're receiving this
02:38 - error here then you need to consider
02:41 - using the OB start now at the end of the
02:45 - page it's always good practice to use
02:49 - another function which will clean the
02:53 - output so we say OB end OB and clean and
03:03 - what this function does is clears the
03:05 - output buffer but doesn't actually give
03:07 - us any contents back so when we refresh
03:10 - this that's still going to redirect and
03:13 - if we change redirect to false so we're
03:15 - not redirecting and we refresh go back
03:19 - and refresh okay so if we use OB and
03:26 - flush and we refresh we get the page
03:31 - contents out so if the redirect is false
03:37 - we're not redirecting but we're still
03:39 - displaying this even if this is not
03:41 - redirecting if you are redirecting the
03:45 - page if you're redirecting the page
03:48 - you'll just need a B and clean and what
03:52 - this does is it won't output anything on
03:55 - the page there's no need for that so OB
03:58 - and flush will put well okay so OB start
04:03 - is storing the output in an internal
04:07 - buffer an OB and flush is flushing this
04:11 - buffer but then producing the contents
04:13 - back onto the page
04:15 - however the way you think about it if
04:18 - you was a
04:18 - logo user out you don't really need to
04:20 - display anything you just need to
04:22 - redirect them maybe to a thank you for
04:24 - logging it or you know see you soon page
04:27 - or something so as it stands this is
04:29 - like this then we change this to true
04:34 - and we successfully redirect the user to
04:39 - another page this can also be an an
04:42 - internal file as well you can say page
04:46 - equals index dot PHP or page equals bi
04:51 - dot PHP or anything so it doesn't have
04:54 - to just be a URL
04:55 - it can be a either your URL or a file
04:58 - within your web server
