00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to creating
00:08 - the exit menu item so we could go ahead
00:12 - and add a new class to our favorites
00:15 - viewer tray but we don't need to create
00:18 - a new file all we need to do is create a
00:22 - class within our web favorite menu
00:24 - item so we'll call it public
00:28 - class exit
00:30 - menu
00:32 - item and then we'll just go ahead and
00:36 - press enter and we need to have it
00:38 - inherit from menu
00:41 - item so that we can use it as a menu
00:43 - item just like all of our
00:46 - favorites so we need to create a
00:48 - Constructor for this so we'll do Public
00:51 - Sub
00:52 - new so whenever a a new exit menu item
00:56 - is created we're going to set the text
00:57 - of that which is uh the C caption of the
01:00 - menu item we're going to set that equal
01:03 - to exit so once this is created text is
01:07 - going to be equal to exit so now what we
01:10 - need to do now what we need to do is we
01:13 - need to access the click event of this
01:17 - um menu item so we'll come over here to
01:20 - exit menu item and we'll open up the
01:22 - events for that and we'll click on the
01:25 - click event so whenever exit menu item
01:29 - has been clicked
01:30 - we would we just want to
01:32 - type
01:34 - application.
01:36 - exit so what this does is it uses
01:39 - application which is um let's read the
01:43 - description here it's provides static
01:45 - methods and properties to manage an
01:47 - application um to start and stop an
01:49 - application and to do other stuff so
01:51 - it's going to access our application
01:52 - that we've created or our exe and exit
01:56 - now this is self-explanatory it says
01:58 - informs all message pumps that they must
02:00 - terminate then closes all application
02:02 - Windows after the messages have been
02:05 - processed so what that means is
02:07 - basically if there's uh let's say a
02:09 - message box open um once you click okay
02:11 - it's going to exit the
02:14 - application so now that we've created
02:16 - our web favorite menu item and our exit
02:19 - menu item we're going to have to add
02:20 - those to our notify
02:23 - icon so we'll go ahead and come over
02:25 - here into form
02:27 - 1vb and under form one VIs changed we
02:30 - want to go ahead and access the load
02:32 - event so we can do this by just clicking
02:35 - form one events and we can scroll until
02:38 - we find load so this will add the form
02:42 - one load event so whenever the form one
02:45 - loads we want to go ahead and create a
02:48 - favorites an object of the favorites
02:50 - class
02:52 - so we'll just create it um inside of
02:55 - form one so that it's not created when
02:57 - the form one
02:58 - loads
03:01 - so we will type public favorites as new
03:10 - favorites or we'll
03:16 - do internet favorites.
03:21 - favorites so we created an object of
03:24 - favorites and what favorites does is it
03:27 - creates a collection of web favorite
03:29 - objects and stores them so that we can
03:32 - use them so it reads through all your
03:34 - favorites stores them in web favorite
03:36 - objects and then adds those to the
03:38 - collection so that we can use them so we
03:40 - have our web favorite
03:42 - here uh let's go to form one so we have
03:45 - our favorite right here so public
03:47 - favorites as new interet favorites.
03:50 - favorites and whenever the form loads we
03:53 - just want to scan the favorites so
03:55 - favorites. scan
03:58 - favorites
04:00 - and now what we need to do is create a
04:02 - context menu so we'll call it object
04:05 - menu as new context
04:09 - menu and I forgot to do this um in the
04:12 - previous tutorial and in this tutorial
04:15 - but full credit for this program goes to
04:17 - the writers of beginning Microsoft
04:18 - Visual Basic 2008 um thean Willis and
04:21 - Brian Newsome they created this great
04:23 - app and I am teaching you guys how you
04:25 - can make it
04:27 - yourself so a context menu would be like
04:30 - this whole menu right here this whole
04:32 - file menu so new project would be a menu
04:35 - item open project would be a menu item
04:37 - open file would be a menu item and then
04:40 - this whole thing is a context menu and
04:43 - now this isn't going to take any
04:46 - arguments so go ahead put this code in
04:49 - if you haven't already um if you have
04:50 - any questions leave them in the comments
04:53 - uh and then if you don't have any
04:54 - questions move on to the next tutorial
