00:00 - what is going on everybody my name is
00:02 - bucky roberts and welcome to your very
00:04 - first c plus plus tutorial now my guess
00:07 - is that if you're watching this video
00:09 - you probably already have a basic
00:11 - understanding of what c plus plus is but
00:13 - for those of you guys who don't c plus
00:16 - is a computer programming language it's
00:19 - how you make computer programs computer
00:21 - games so if you're interested in making
00:23 - any of those then congratulations you're
00:26 - in the right spot
00:27 - so before you just start opening any
00:29 - program and trying to write c plus code
00:32 - i want to let you guys know that you
00:34 - need to download and install a few
00:36 - programs first now good news all these
00:38 - programs are entirely free but before we
00:41 - just go ahead and start installing them
00:43 - let me tell you guys what they are and
00:44 - what they do the first program that
00:46 - you're going to need is called an i d e
00:50 - this is pretty much the program that
00:51 - allows us to write the code and run it
00:54 - aside from that we need something called
00:56 - a compiler now a compiler is basically
01:00 - the thing that
01:01 - translates the code that something that
01:04 - computer programs can understand to
01:06 - something computers can understand so
01:09 - we're going to be typing code and it's
01:11 - going to be easy for us to read and
01:13 - understand what's going on but in order
01:15 - to transfer it to or excuse me translate
01:18 - it to a bunch of ones and zeroes that
01:19 - the computer can understand we need that
01:22 - compiler so that being said a lot of
01:24 - people download these separately they
01:27 - download ide and then they download a
01:29 - compiler but what i'm going to be doing
01:32 - is i'm going to be showing you guys a
01:33 - program that
01:35 - is going to allow you to download and
01:37 - install it all in one big shebang so
01:39 - let's go ahead and open google and like
01:42 - i said don't worry about paying for
01:44 - anything because this program is
01:46 - entirely free so anyways like i said go
01:48 - ahead and open google and type in code
01:51 - blocks and go ahead and press enter
01:54 - now the first link that's going to pop
01:55 - up is probably going to be for
01:57 - codeblocks dot org so go ahead and click
02:00 - that and this is the program that we're
02:02 - going to be downloading so of course we
02:05 - need to find the download link you can
02:07 - either click on this one on the left or
02:09 - this one on top doesn't matter go ahead
02:11 - and click on one of those and we see a
02:14 - couple options here download the binary
02:16 - release download the source code or
02:18 - retrieve source code from svn
02:21 - we're going to want to download the
02:22 - binary release it's the easiest and most
02:25 - simple way to
02:26 - download this program code blocks so go
02:29 - ahead and click download binary release
02:33 - and check it out it gives us all these
02:35 - options
02:36 - now depending on what platform you're
02:38 - running most of you guys are probably
02:40 - running windows you're going to want to
02:41 - choose one of these options but for
02:43 - those of you running linux and they also
02:46 - have a mac version down here you might
02:48 - want to choose these but for most of us
02:50 - we're going to be running this on a
02:51 - windows machine so you're saying all
02:53 - right now we haven't narrowed down to
02:55 - two choices codeblocks 1005 setup or
02:59 - codeblocks 1005 mingw setup what we want
03:03 - to do is we want to download this second
03:06 - one the one that says min gw now this
03:09 - version 1005 may be different depending
03:12 - on when you're watching this tutorial
03:13 - and if they updated code blocks but make
03:16 - sure you get the one that says m-i-n-gw
03:18 - the first one is the ide the second one
03:22 - m-m-i-n-gw that m-i-n-gw means the
03:25 - compiler too so when we download this
03:28 - it's going to give us the ide and
03:30 - remember that's where we write the code
03:32 - at the compiler as well and remember the
03:34 - compiler is the program we need
03:37 - so the computer can understand what
03:38 - we're doing so go ahead and you can
03:40 - either download it from barely os or so
03:43 - excuse me sourceforge um i already have
03:46 - it downloaded so i'm not going to click
03:48 - this but
03:49 - oh excuse me i guess i'm flaming my
03:51 - throat i just drank fruitista freeze
03:53 - from taco bell and i ate a taco and that
03:56 - is not a good idea because they should
03:58 - call these things brain freezes brain
04:00 - freezies because that's all it does to
04:02 - you just freezes your brain in your
04:04 - throat and
04:06 - and it puts a bunch of phlegm in your
04:07 - throat but i can't stop drinking it it's
04:09 - addicting so anyways go ahead and click
04:11 - this link from sourceforge.net and go
04:13 - ahead and save the file and whenever you
04:16 - save it and open it a wizard's gonna pop
04:19 - up and you just have to click next like
04:20 - 80 different times and then you have
04:22 - code blocks installed so i already
04:25 - installed it so i'm not going to walk
04:26 - you guys through how to do that because
04:28 - it's really simple and i'm not going to
04:31 - act like you guys are dumb and you don't
04:32 - know how to install things on your
04:33 - computer so anyways once you have it
04:35 - installed you have this program called
04:37 - code blocks right here now you probably
04:39 - have it on your all programs you might
04:42 - have it under code blocks what i like to
04:44 - do is right click it and just send it to
04:47 - desktop and what that's going to do is
04:48 - it's going to give you a nice little
04:49 - icon on your desktop
04:51 - but anyways once you have it installed
04:53 - just go ahead and double click it and
04:55 - we're going to run a really simple
04:57 - program just to make sure it's working
04:59 - correctly so go ahead it gives you these
05:01 - tips close them out what we're going to
05:03 - want to do is create a new project and
05:05 - you can either do that by creating this
05:07 - new project right here but what i like
05:09 - to do is i like to go up to the file
05:11 - menu and click new
05:13 - project
05:14 - now it's going to give you a list of a
05:16 - bunch of different projects you're going
05:17 - to want to create what we're going to
05:19 - want to choose is console application
05:21 - this is where you're going to be
05:22 - choosing most of the time this pretty
05:23 - much means a basic program for the
05:26 - computer so just go ahead and select
05:28 - this and press go
05:30 - and make sure you're working in c plus
05:33 - plus c is a totally different language
05:35 - we don't want that so c plus plus go
05:37 - ahead and click next and now name your
05:39 - project anything you want i'm going to
05:41 - name mine
05:42 - youtube why not and you can save it
05:45 - wherever you want i might as well just
05:47 - save mine right on desktop it looks good
05:49 - but it really doesn't matter where you
05:50 - save it or even what your name your
05:52 - project just name it something that's
05:53 - easy to remember so go ahead and give
05:55 - your project title go ahead and click
05:57 - next and make sure you're using the gnu
06:00 - gcc compiler
06:02 - basically everything should be set up by
06:04 - default make sure your settings look the
06:06 - same as mine as long as you didn't hit
06:08 - anything by accident you should be good
06:09 - to go so go ahead and click finish
06:12 - and
06:13 - you see that nothing pops up by default
06:16 - you're saying all right i thought we
06:17 - just created something so how do we see
06:19 - what we just created actually if you
06:21 - click this little plus sign next to
06:23 - sources it shows you that all the files
06:26 - it created for you automatically so go
06:28 - ahead and double click this main cpp
06:31 - and it shows you or in other words it
06:32 - brings up the file that it created
06:35 - automatically so this is actually the
06:37 - core
06:38 - basics of a very simple c plus plus
06:41 - program we don't understand what
06:43 - anything means right now but trust me
06:45 - it's a very simple computer program that
06:47 - the only thing it does is it prints out
06:49 - hello world on the screen so to make
06:52 - sure that everything is set up and
06:53 - running smoothly let's go ahead and
06:56 - we need to do something called build and
06:59 - run this now i'm going to be talking
07:00 - about this later but for now i just want
07:02 - to make sure that your computer is set
07:04 - up you installed it and downloaded it
07:06 - properly so go ahead and click this
07:09 - build and run icon right here it's with
07:11 - the little gear and the little green
07:13 - triangle so go ahead and click that and
07:16 - it should you know maybe flash a couple
07:18 - boxes but basically a box should pop up
07:21 - that says hello world and this is all
07:23 - that that program is basically it prints
07:26 - out hello world on your screen so if you
07:29 - build and run this and you get hello
07:30 - world it means that you downloaded it
07:33 - installed it and set up your project
07:35 - successfully so we are good to go so
07:38 - again
07:39 - i know you guys don't know what any of
07:41 - this means or even know how to code one
07:43 - line of code yet but i'm gonna be going
07:45 - over that in the future tutorials but
07:47 - for now that's all i have for you guys
07:49 - so thank you very much for watching
07:51 - don't forget to subscribe and i'll see
07:52 - you next tutorial
