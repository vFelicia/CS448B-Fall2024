00:00 - hi there this is Alex from PHP academy'
00:02 - org and this is another video tutorial
00:04 - for the new Boston now in this video I'm
00:07 - going to be talking about concatenation
00:09 - within PHP now if you've ever come
00:12 - across the word concatenation you'll
00:13 - understand what it means or if you
00:15 - program before you might understand how
00:18 - to concatenate different variables
00:20 - together on how to print out things and
00:23 - then concatenate variables in so you can
00:25 - view them in a sentence if you like now
00:28 - in PHP it's really really simple let's
00:31 - start out by creating just a few
00:32 - variables so the first thing I'm going
00:35 - to do is create a variable called day
00:37 - and this is going to be equal to the day
00:39 - of the week so today it is Thursday and
00:42 - I'm going to create another variable
00:44 - called let's say date and this is just
00:53 - going to be simply equal to the day in
00:57 - numerical value so it's the 31st today
01:00 - now down here if I wanted to say echo
01:06 - out the day and then the date so
01:08 - eventually I want it to say there so
01:11 - let's just echo it out so we know what
01:12 - we're doing Thursday I could say the
01:17 - date is Thursday 31 just just to make
01:21 - things simple we could eventually faff
01:23 - around with St but that would use if
01:24 - statements which is later on so the date
01:28 - is Thursday the 31st this is what we
01:30 - want our program to display we could in
01:34 - fact incorporate the year in as well so
01:36 - I'm going to say year equals I'm going
01:38 - to say 2011 now the reason I'm doing
01:40 - this is for example if it was the year
01:42 - 2000 in actual fact it would work so
01:47 - yeah okay we'll keep this as in to the
01:49 - data so the year equals 2011 so we've
01:52 - got a variable called day we've got a
01:54 - variable called date and we've got a
01:55 - variable called year so we'll eventually
01:58 - we want this program to display the date
02:00 - is Thursday the 31st 2011 but we want it
02:03 - to use these variables rather than a
02:06 - predefined set of text that we've
02:09 - written out so the way we do this is we
02:12 - can either you
02:13 - our double quotation marks which is
02:15 - going to make life a lot easier for us
02:17 - orga new singles now I'm going to use
02:19 - singles at first because it's a lot
02:21 - better for you to learn with single
02:23 - quotation marks and then you can go
02:25 - ahead and be lazy and use the doubles if
02:26 - you like so with a single quotation
02:29 - marks I'm going to start typing the date
02:31 - is
02:33 - okay so I've left a space here on
02:34 - purpose now after the last single
02:39 - quotation mark but before the line
02:41 - Terminator we want to add a full stop so
02:44 - it's just a single dot on this line then
02:46 - what we need to do is just simply
02:48 - address the variable that we want to
02:51 - echo so this is still all included on
02:53 - the echo line if we put the day here
02:57 - it's still going to echo out day even
02:59 - though haven't sort of preper echo in
03:02 - front of it so concatenation just
03:03 - basically means we're joining something
03:05 - on to the string that we already echoing
03:07 - so the date is day then we want a space
03:11 - so I'm going to concatenate on and a
03:13 - piece of string data with just a space
03:16 - inside and then concatenate on as well
03:18 - with another dot date and then I'm going
03:22 - to concatenate on another space so we're
03:24 - using the full stop and then the space
03:26 - here with the with the sir single
03:30 - quotation marks and then eventually
03:32 - we're going to do yeah now obviously we
03:35 - don't need to concatenate anything else
03:36 - onto the end of that because that is the
03:38 - end of our line so now we can just
03:40 - preview let's have a look in our browser
03:42 - refresh and you can see that it says the
03:45 - date is Thursday 31st 2011 now what
03:49 - helps to make a change here so I could
03:51 - say it's Friday the 32nd 2011 I know
03:57 - that's an unrealistic value we'll go for
04:00 - 30 then to see don't go confuse so you
04:02 - could say it's Wednesday okay so it's
04:04 - Wednesday the 30th 2011 let's refresh
04:08 - and you can see that's updated itself
04:11 - again the same with the year and this
04:14 - can be changed as well and it will just
04:17 - simply update the output so this is the
04:19 - harder but faster way to sort of echo
04:24 - variables within
04:26 - string data as well obviously we can
04:28 - also echo things onto the end of this
04:30 - example we might do a strong tag and
04:33 - then we might put a strong hug just
04:36 - before here so the way this is going to
04:38 - work is we're echoing out normal text a
04:41 - bit of HTML just before we declare this
04:45 - in within the concatenation and we have
04:48 - a space we have the date we have a space
04:50 - we have the year and then we end with
04:53 - ending the HTML so let's refresh and you
04:57 - can see that that's time bold so this is
05:00 - a better way to do things but now let's
05:03 - take for the easy way so let's echo the
05:06 - date
05:07 - in fact we're using double quotation
05:10 - marks now you're going to see how easy
05:12 - it is to do it this way the date is day
05:16 - date year and that's it we don't need to
05:21 - concatenate because we're using
05:23 - variables within a string now you might
05:26 - think that this will output dollar sign
05:29 - year in actual fact if we had single
05:31 - quotation marks you can see what happens
05:35 - you can see that it's literally
05:37 - outputted the dollar sign day the dollar
05:42 - sign date the dollar sign year when in
05:44 - actual fact we want it to reference this
05:49 - very these various 3 variables here so
05:51 - all we do is change these to double
05:54 - quotation marks and you'll see that that
05:57 - magically updates itself and puts the
05:59 - variables in there for you so it's it's
06:02 - totally personal preference like I've
06:03 - explained before single quotation marks
06:06 - are faster concatenation gets you used
06:08 - to looking at complex code and
06:09 - understanding what's outputted where so
06:12 - I'd always recommend using the single
06:14 - quotation marks and the concatenation
06:16 - for each variable so that's basically
06:19 - concatenated with in PHP
