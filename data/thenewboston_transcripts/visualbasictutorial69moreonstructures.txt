00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be taking
00:08 - another look at structures and we're
00:10 - going to be working more on the program
00:13 - that we created in the last tutorial now
00:15 - if you don't know what I'm talking about
00:16 - right here or what this uh form is then
00:18 - go ahead and move back one tutorial to I
00:20 - think tutorial uh
00:22 - 68 and you'll see how to make this uh
00:25 - make what we've made so far so we
00:28 - declared a structure and we called it C
00:30 - customer then we created an object um
00:33 - that is a customer which is a
00:35 - structure so now what we need to do is
00:39 - we need to uh assign some values to the
00:43 - first name last name and email of this
00:45 - object customer so we'll go ahead and
00:48 - click list customer or button one
00:52 - click so uh let's go ahead and change
00:55 - this the name of this to button list
00:59 - customer
01:01 - okay so now we'll come back here and
01:04 - let's just go ahead and assign the first
01:06 - name last name and email of object
01:08 - customer whenever they click button one
01:11 - we could do this when the form loads and
01:12 - we could do it outside of it but let's
01:14 - just do it under button one click so
01:16 - we'll type
01:18 - object customer and then if we use dot
01:22 - you're going to see that we have you can
01:24 - see all of the ones with the blue boxes
01:26 - right here now that stands for a
01:28 - variable so we got email first name and
01:32 - last name so we'll set first name equal
01:36 - to uh
01:38 - gy and now we will set the last
01:44 - name equal
01:47 - to H Jones and we'll go ahead and set
01:50 - his email
01:54 - to
01:56 - equals uh let's just do jones. Jin
02:02 - mlive.com
02:03 - okay so now that we have set a value I
02:07 - mean a yeah a value for each of the
02:09 - variables inside of the structure object
02:12 - customer um let's go ahead and add those
02:17 - add the customer to these text boxes
02:20 - right here so we could do this right on
02:23 - button one. click but we want to use a
02:27 - uh sub because this makes it easier to
02:30 - reuse code and we're not going to have
02:31 - to copy and paste which is a very bad
02:33 - habit that you don't want to get into so
02:36 - what we're going to do is we are going
02:37 - to create a sub called display
02:41 - customer now what this is going to do is
02:44 - it's going to get our structure and it's
02:46 - going to add it to the text boxes so
02:49 - we'll go ahead and
02:51 - type private
02:54 - sub display customer and now for our
02:58 - arguments we're going to have have to
03:00 - pass a uh a customer object to it so
03:03 - I'll just type buy Val we could use Bure
03:06 - but we don't want to accidentally change
03:08 - the values of object customer so we'll
03:10 - just go ahead and make a copy of object
03:13 - customer by using by Val and it's just
03:15 - going to be used this sub and then when
03:17 - the sub's exited it's gone so we'll just
03:20 - type cust as
03:24 - customer which is the data type so now
03:28 - what we're going to do is we are going
03:30 - to
03:31 - type text first name. text
03:37 - equals cust which is the customer object
03:40 - that is passed to display
03:42 - customer. first
03:45 - name now we're going to do text last
03:48 - name. text and we'll set that equal to
03:50 - cust do last name and now I'll do this
03:55 - one more time for the email so text
03:57 - email. text equals c
04:01 - do email okay so now let's go ahead and
04:07 - run this and see what
04:08 - happens so if we go ahead and click list
04:11 - customer looks like we're getting an
04:13 - error
04:14 - here ah no never mind we're not getting
04:17 - an error we need to go ahead and call
04:21 - display customer so whenever they click
04:24 - it whenever they click uh button one
04:26 - it's going to call display customer and
04:28 - we will just pass
04:30 - object customer to that so it sets the
04:33 - values of that and then displays it on
04:36 - the text boxes okay so let's go ahead
04:39 - and run this and if we click list
04:40 - customer we get Jim Jones and jones. Jim
04:45 - live.com so um go ahead and make this
04:48 - program if you haven't already uh you
04:50 - can play around more with the structure
04:52 - see what you can do with it and then
04:54 - once you have done that you can go ahead
04:56 - and move on to the next tutorial and in
04:57 - the next tutorial we're going to be
04:58 - working more on this program and then
05:00 - after that we're going to be done with
05:01 - this program and we're going to be
05:02 - moving on to uh other topics so um go
05:07 - ahead I'll scroll up and down through
05:08 - this you can go and pause wherever you
05:10 - want if you want to see the
05:14 - code so thanks for watching guys and
05:16 - stay tuned for the next
05:18 - tutorial
