00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is another video tutorial for
00:05 - the new Boston now in this tutorial
00:07 - we're going to be talking or rather in
00:09 - this short tutorial series we've got get
00:12 - variable the post variable and we're
00:14 - also talking about requests which will
00:16 - be something later on when we've
00:17 - understood about forms in general this
00:19 - first tutorial is going to talk about
00:22 - HTML forms we're going to go sort of
00:24 - back to basics and how we use them in
00:27 - different elements of them that allow us
00:29 - to process data through PHP or send data
00:32 - to a page rather now I'm going to be
00:36 - using this at this example on for the
00:38 - same page but when you do post data you
00:41 - can either post it to the same page that
00:43 - you're on currently or you can post it
00:45 - to another page now if you don't
00:47 - understand what I'm talking about that's
00:48 - absolutely fine I will begin to create
00:51 - my HTML form and I'll explain each
00:53 - element of the form as we go along we're
00:55 - not actually going to be doing any PHP
00:57 - programming necessarily in this video
01:01 - okay so the first thing we do when we
01:03 - specify a form is the start and the end
01:05 - tag of the form we also specify an
01:09 - action and a method now the action is
01:13 - where this form is going to submit when
01:15 - a submit button is clicked so we include
01:18 - a submit button on our form this will be
01:20 - inside here a bit later on now the first
01:22 - thing we do like I said is we we declare
01:25 - the all the action sorry yet with the
01:27 - action first so in this case I own the
01:30 - action to link back to this same page
01:34 - and this page is called index.php you
01:37 - can see this shown here and up here as
01:39 - well so we've got form action equals
01:42 - index dot PHP when a submit button is
01:44 - clicked the form will then submit any
01:47 - data that is inside of it to this same
01:52 - page and then we can start to process
01:54 - this data inside our PHP tags the method
01:58 - can either be get or post depending on
02:03 - how you're submitting the variables now
02:06 - a little about either of them get is
02:08 - basically sending the data and
02:12 - it's visible in the URL and it's sending
02:14 - the variables through a the format of
02:17 - the URL post sends data through the HTTP
02:21 - POST method so they're slightly
02:23 - different I'm not going to talk about
02:25 - them quite yet but I'm going to use get
02:28 - just to show you an example in this in
02:31 - this tutorial so what do we want to do
02:34 - first the first thing I'm going to do is
02:36 - I'm going to enter some input fields so
02:40 - I'm going to say day and I'm going to
02:45 - create an input type or an input tag so
02:49 - on its own it would look like this and
02:52 - the type is going to be text the name of
02:55 - it is essentially what you're naming it
02:58 - in regards to a variable this will be
03:01 - submitted and we can pick it up using
03:03 - the collection of get variables which is
03:06 - almost like an associative array so the
03:10 - name of this I'm going to call is day
03:13 - now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
03:15 - break down and I'm going to say date
03:20 - input type equals text name equals date
03:27 - so we're calling it something different
03:28 - we're breaking down again and we're
03:31 - saying year so input type equals text
03:36 - name equals year we break down a couple
03:41 - more times just to keep everything neat
03:43 - and I'm going to create a button in fact
03:46 - let's just see how this looks at the
03:47 - moment let's refresh okay so we've got
03:50 - day date and year in actual fact just to
03:55 - make things a bit tidier I'm going to
03:57 - break in between each one of these as
04:00 - well so that is looking like that
04:04 - so if essentially created our form
04:05 - already we just need a button like I
04:07 - said earlier down here and that's input
04:10 - type of submit and the value of that is
04:12 - what just what is what is displayed so
04:15 - if I get rid of this here and I refresh
04:18 - you can see it says just as submit some
04:21 - browsers it will default to submit
04:23 - request but I can specify
04:25 - by anything here you can see that that
04:28 - will just create to look like anything
04:31 - what they'll create with the capitalized
04:33 - text anything so I'm just going to call
04:35 - this submit okay so now what's going to
04:37 - happen is if you watch by default my
04:41 - browser doesn't show the index dot PHP
04:43 - page in its URL however I was to click
04:47 - on submit like I said earlier we've
04:49 - supplied the action of this form to go
04:51 - to index dot PHP so when I click on it
04:54 - you'll notice the URL up here changes
04:57 - and we've also included a few variables
04:59 - we've got day date and the year so the
05:04 - way this works is after the page name
05:06 - itself which is here in blue we have a
05:09 - question mark and after this we specify
05:11 - our variables so the name of the
05:13 - variable is day and that is equal to
05:15 - something at the moment is nothing and
05:18 - then we say and with an ampersand symbol
05:20 - we say date is equal to something here
05:22 - at the moment it's equal to nothing and
05:24 - then again the year is equal to
05:27 - something here which at the moment it's
05:29 - equal to nothing so here for example I
05:31 - type Monday I tote 31st and I took 2011
05:36 - and I click Submit if you look at the
05:38 - top of the page you can see that the URL
05:40 - has changed and in actual fact day is
05:43 - equal to Monday data is equal to 31st
05:46 - and the year is equal to 2011 so now we
05:50 - have submitted what's called get
05:52 - variables through PHP using a form so
05:58 - that's how to create a form and submit
06:00 - them however we want to actually do
06:02 - something with them now in the next
06:04 - tutorial we're going to be looking at
06:06 - get variables and how we should use them
06:09 - and why we should use them and then in
06:11 - the other tutorial going to look at post
06:13 - variables and again the same how we use
06:16 - them why we use them so this has been
06:20 - basically how to create the form and
06:21 - submitting the variables and so we can
06:25 - use them eventually in PHP
