00:01 - all right guys now that we know how to
00:02 - change background color let's spice
00:04 - things up even more let's learn how to
00:06 - add images as the background so the
00:10 - first thing that we need to do is make
00:13 - sure that we have our body tags in here
00:15 - because that's what we're going to be
00:17 - editing that background of the body so
00:19 - go ahead and as your element go ahead
00:21 - and type body and give you some space to
00:24 - work with and the first thing I want to
00:26 - teach you guys is how to add an image is
00:29 - the back around so again make sure that
00:32 - whatever directory you're working in let
00:34 - me uh minimize this a little bit make
00:37 - sure whatever directory you're working
00:39 - in that you have see I'm working at this
00:43 - file right here the index make sure you
00:45 - have an image file either a gif or a
00:48 - JPEG or a ping in the same folder as the
00:51 - file you're working on and I have a
00:54 - little you can see my face right here a
00:57 - little picture file called my face. ping
01:00 - so remember that cuz that's going to
01:01 - come in uh handy in about 5 seconds so
01:04 - in order to add an image for our
01:07 - background you need the property
01:10 - background minus image and for the value
01:14 - you need to set it to this
01:16 - URL and then go ahead and put
01:20 - parentheses now inside the parentheses
01:23 - go ahead and type the name of the file
01:26 - my face. ping now go ahead and add your
01:30 - semicolon and this is how you change the
01:33 - background image so a lot of you guys
01:35 - might think that um just put background
01:37 - image and then the file name no that's
01:39 - not it make sure you have that URL or
01:42 - it's not going to work so let's go ahead
01:44 - and save this and see what we
01:46 - get pretty sweet looking website this is
01:49 - actually one of the prettiest websites I
01:50 - think I've ever created in my life
01:52 - pretty sweet just a bunch of bies it
01:54 - kind of looks like a kind of reminds me
01:56 - of that Brady Bunch intro where there's
01:59 - like nine people
02:00 - there's a story of some dudes named
02:03 - Bucky you know okay I'm just going to I
02:07 - better stop singing so anyways you're
02:09 - saying all right Bucky your face is
02:11 - beautiful but we don't need 80 of them
02:13 - right there well if you just have an
02:15 - image and you just want one image and
02:18 - you don't want it to repeat then you can
02:21 - change that as well I mean by default as
02:23 - you saw the image is just going to
02:25 - repeat both left and right and up and
02:27 - down it's going to tile itself so you
02:29 - don't always want this effect so in
02:31 - order to make it not repeat go ahead and
02:35 - type background
02:38 - minus repeats and as the property you
02:41 - can either have it I think it's like
02:43 - repeat on by default or something
02:45 - anyways default is what you saw if you
02:48 - don't want it to repeat then type
02:50 - no repeat and check it out if we save
02:53 - this and refresh we see we only have one
02:57 - image that doesn't repeat so if you you
02:59 - know you you made this big cool
03:01 - background that you know some images are
03:03 - made for repeating some aren't so
03:05 - anyways you know no need to explain so
03:08 - that is how you get an image not to
03:10 - repeat and I just shook that and since I
03:13 - have Windows 7 it closed everything so
03:16 - let me open everything back up and yeah
03:18 - make sure we got that so
03:21 - anyways that is how you make it not
03:23 - repeat but if you're saying all right
03:25 - but what if a special case scenario
03:27 - comes along that I only want to repeat
03:29 - left and right or dang it now my camasa
03:33 - shut there we go my screen recorder shut
03:36 - down I didn't know how long I had on my
03:37 - video but I got to remember not to shake
03:39 - any windows again I guess but anyways
03:43 - sometimes you're going to come across a
03:44 - situation where you have this image but
03:46 - you only want to tile either left or
03:48 - right or up and down so you can do that
03:51 - using the same background repeat
03:53 - property but instead of no repeat go
03:55 - ahead and change to repeat minus X and
03:59 - this is going to tile it let me show you
04:02 - left and right in the x axis the x- axis
04:05 - is left and right Y is up and down and Z
04:09 - is forward and backward but um since
04:11 - we're working with a computer screen we
04:12 - don't have Z so you know just a little
04:14 - tidbit of information so that tiles it
04:16 - left and right why if you repeat
04:20 - it tiles up and down this kind of
04:23 - reminds me of you know when you go to
04:24 - the mall and you put like a dollar in
04:26 - those photo booths you know that's what
04:28 - it reminds me of
04:30 - kind of freaky seeing me staring at
04:31 - myself but anyways that is how you tile
04:34 - it up and down and the last thing I want
04:37 - to mention is um let's go ahead and put
04:42 - no repeat so I can demonstrate the last
04:45 - point I have whenever you have a
04:48 - background image I mean you might be
04:50 - saying this all right I want one image I
04:53 - don't want it to repeat but the only
04:55 - thing is I don't want it stuck in the
04:57 - top left corner I want it either you
05:00 - know maybe centered on your website or
05:01 - maybe you want it 10 pixels over and 50
05:04 - pixels down or you want it in a specific
05:06 - location you don't always want it jammed
05:08 - up in the top left so in order to do
05:11 - that you need a property
05:13 - called background
05:16 - minus position and this lets you alter
05:19 - the position of your background image
05:22 - now this takes two parameters the first
05:25 - parameter or the first piece of
05:26 - information it needs is how far from the
05:29 - left hand side do you want to move it so
05:31 - go ahead and put 10 pixels now your
05:34 - image is going to be shifted 10 pixels
05:37 - to the right and the next piece of
05:40 - information you need to give is how far
05:42 - from the top do you want to move it so
05:44 - let's say you want to move it 60 pixels
05:46 - down so go ahead and write 60 pixels and
05:50 - that's it just save it and see what we
05:51 - got so now that we change that
05:54 - background position 10 pixels 50 pixels
05:57 - it took this image which was jammed up
05:59 - in the the top left moved it 10 pixels
06:01 - to the right and 60 pixels down or 50 I
06:04 - forgot what I put 60 there we go but
06:08 - saying all right that's pretty cool
06:09 - Bucky but I don't let's say I want
06:13 - something like I want this picture
06:14 - centered on my web page but I don't know
06:17 - how big their browser windows going to
06:19 - be so how am I supposed to guess how
06:21 - many pixels well lucky for you not only
06:25 - can you do this with pixels but you can
06:27 - also do it as percentages so if you want
06:30 - it 60 pixels down but you want it
06:33 - centered then just go ahead and say all
06:35 - right move it 50% from the left and this
06:38 - is going to center it left and right or
06:41 - horizontal you know whatever so let's go
06:44 - ahead and save this and see what we got
06:46 - since it's 50% to the left that means
06:49 - there's 50% to the right that means your
06:52 - background image is perfectly centered
06:54 - in the middle of your website so this is
06:57 - perfectly centered left and right and
06:59 - and it's also down 60 pixels so that is
07:03 - pretty much all you need to know with
07:04 - working with background images um again
07:07 - there's probably some more but this is
07:09 - pretty much the core Foundation of
07:11 - working with background images so if you
07:14 - understand this then you should be good
07:15 - to go from now on so anyways that's all
07:17 - I have for you guys for this tutorial I
07:19 - know I threw a lot at you but uh you can
07:21 - always watch it again if you didn't
