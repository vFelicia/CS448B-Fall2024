00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and I
00:02 - just want to make a real quick video to
00:03 - update you guys actually this drop again
00:05 - be a pretty long video but I want to
00:07 - make a video to update you guys on a
00:08 - couple things I got some news for you
00:10 - guys and a lot of you guys are probably
00:11 - gonna be real upset at first but just
00:13 - stick with me
00:14 - it gets better I promise so the first
00:16 - thing is good news my entire website is
00:19 - updated so for everyone who is asking to
00:22 - put my videos in a playlist if you go to
00:24 - my website every video I have is now on
00:27 - there and in the playlist nice and
00:29 - organized so there you go check out my
00:31 - website all the videos nice and
00:32 - organized the next thing I want to talk
00:34 - to you guys about is kind of sounds like
00:36 - it's gonna be bad news at first but
00:37 - trust me it's not I decided not to teach
00:40 - a blender and not to teach ocher and I
00:43 - know a lot of you guys we're looking
00:44 - forward to game development and you guys
00:46 - are probably you know pío to me right
00:48 - now but before you freak out just listen
00:50 - to what I have to say so first let me
00:52 - say this I've wanted to create computer
00:55 - games ever since I first sat behind a
00:57 - computer it's the reason I started
00:59 - learning programming it's the least
01:00 - reason I went to college for computer
01:02 - programming it's been my goal for a very
01:04 - long time to make awesome computer games
01:07 - and also teach you guys how to make
01:09 - awesome computer games as well so that
01:11 - being said here's the reason I decided
01:13 - to not teach over 3d ocher 3d is a 3d
01:17 - graphics engine and 3d is only one small
01:21 - aspect of game development for example
01:23 - whenever you make a 3d game you need a
01:26 - lot of things other than just the 3d
01:28 - engine a 3d engine basically helps you
01:31 - put 3d objects on the screen that's it
01:33 - in order to make a game you need like
01:36 - physics libraries sound libraries you
01:39 - need to code networking artificial
01:41 - intelligence there's so many more
01:43 - aspects to a game other than just
01:44 - programming 3d objects and stuff so that
01:49 - is a kind of why I'm not teaching over
01:51 - but aside from them
01:53 - um whenever you're going to get a job in
01:56 - the computer game or even you know the
01:59 - programming industry your ogre still
02:02 - skills aren't really gonna get you in
02:04 - the door it's a good graphics library
02:07 - but if you want a job working for like a
02:10 - major company ogre is it really your
02:13 - best bet so the huge companies kind of
02:16 - stay away from ogre it's awesome if you
02:18 - wanna you know make a game with your
02:19 - friends or if you're working on a
02:21 - college project then ogre is the best
02:23 - you know it's pretty good choice but if
02:26 - you're gonna go jump into the industry
02:28 - and making professional applications
02:30 - I wouldn't recommend ocher surveying
02:33 - alright that sucks you're not gonna
02:34 - teach auger I guess my game development
02:36 - days are over that's the reason I
02:38 - subscribe to you Bucky see you later
02:40 - well let me tell you guys this before
02:43 - you know start writing nasty comments on
02:45 - I don't know send me like anthrax and
02:47 - the email anthrax and email anthrax in
02:50 - my mail but anyways the solution to not
02:53 - teaching ogre and not developing using
02:56 - this 3d graphics library is this instead
02:58 - of teaching you a 3d graphics library
03:00 - I'm gonna be teaching you a full-blown
03:03 - game engine now a game engine I feel let
03:07 - me talk about this first I know I talked
03:09 - to you about like a 3d engines and game
03:12 - engines you guys are like what the heck
03:14 - even is an engine I know what engine is
03:16 - my car but you say engine Allah please
03:19 - tell me what the engine is and I'll
03:21 - explain it way back when when they first
03:23 - started making games they made 3d games
03:25 - like doom and quake like the very first
03:30 - 3d games ever and whenever they were
03:32 - programming it they kind of started
03:34 - writing the same code over and over all
03:37 - right we need to write code for physics
03:39 - and collision detection and how the
03:41 - graphics appear on the screen now let's
03:44 - make another game all the physics all
03:46 - the collision detection all the way your
03:48 - graphics appear on your screen and for
03:51 - the same game they were typing the same
03:52 - code over and over and over because you
03:55 - know with every single game the graphics
03:57 - are the same how your computer works
03:59 - with sound is the same collision
04:01 - detection is always the same so instead
04:04 - of writing the same
04:05 - over and over and over and don't forget
04:07 - the game was changing but this little
04:09 - pieces of code were staying the same
04:11 - those pieces of code that always stayed
04:13 - the same those code is what make up your
04:16 - engine it's the core functionality
04:18 - behind every game the kind of stuff that
04:21 - you don't need to create new every time
04:22 - it's the basic core functionality that
04:25 - stays the same and what happens is you
04:28 - have this main engine and that allows
04:30 - the developer to concentrate on the cool
04:32 - stuff like the design the character
04:34 - design the main concept all the fun
04:36 - stuff so it gives you all that core
04:39 - functionality of how sound works on the
04:41 - computer of how graphics display on the
04:43 - screen and all that stuff and now you
04:45 - get to concentrate on the character
04:47 - design and you know all the fun stuff
04:48 - like I said so that's what an engine is
04:52 - so you're saying re instead of teaching
04:54 - the graphics engine what are you going
04:56 - to be teaching me I'm gonna be teaching
04:57 - you the best game engine on earth and
05:00 - that's Unreal Engine this is the engine
05:04 - that is used by huge companies to
05:06 - develop awesome games and I know in the
05:08 - last video I told you guys about ogre
05:10 - and I showed you guys that game and it
05:12 - looked pretty cool but it was like kind
05:14 - of you know not a great game it was a
05:16 - pretty cool game but I'm not talking
05:18 - like a huge game let me tell you guys
05:20 - some of the games that are made using
05:22 - Unreal Engine Gears of War
05:24 - let's see army up to Bioshock and
05:27 - Borderlands I'm talking huge epic some
05:30 - of the most amazing games ever built was
05:33 - built using Unreal Engine so I figured
05:35 - you know what if we're gonna learn to
05:37 - develop games we're gonna do it right
05:39 - and we're gonna use the right engine so
05:41 - instead of you know give me any guys the
05:43 - kiddie kind of college version we're
05:45 - gonna be jumping right into the pro
05:47 - level
05:47 - Unreal Engine to develop awesome and
05:51 - epic games so I you know no need you
05:54 - know messing around with a small stuff
05:56 - let's go right for the professional
05:57 - stuff that's my theory and aside from
06:00 - that
06:01 - Unreal Engine has everything you need it
06:04 - has audio animation oh let me think
06:06 - networking level editors artificial
06:09 - intelligence everything you need to
06:11 - develop any game in the world you have
06:13 - an Unreal Engine so you know that's a
06:15 - lot better just suppose the ogre 3d so
06:19 - the last thing I want to mention about
06:20 - Unreal Engine is like I said with ogre
06:24 - 3d it's you know you might want to
06:27 - mention it whenever you're looking for a
06:28 - job but it's not gonna really get you in
06:31 - the door if you go up to a industry like
06:33 - you know a main gaming company that
06:36 - develops huge games and tell them you
06:38 - know Unreal Engine they're gonna be
06:40 - begging to hire you it doesn't matter if
06:43 - you have a college degree or not if you
06:44 - know Unreal Engine you pretty much are
06:46 - guaranteed the job in the computer game
06:48 - industry since this is the main program
06:50 - that huge companies use again some other
06:53 - companies like blizzard and stuff they
06:55 - probably make their own engines but you
06:57 - know this is like one of the main
06:59 - engines out there so enough about you
07:01 - know Unreal Engine pretty much it's
07:04 - amazing it's the best game engine it's
07:06 - gonna guarantee you a job if you know
07:08 - and that's why I'm citing Unreal Engine
07:10 - game engine rather than a small graphics
07:13 - engine so I'm done talking about Unreal
07:16 - Engine for now and now I'm let me
07:18 - explain you guys why I decided not to
07:19 - teach a blender 13 now before you know
07:22 - I'm not crapping on blender 3d here
07:24 - because it's an awesome 3d modelling
07:26 - program but it's not the best out there
07:28 - it's free and you know for being free
07:32 - it's the best free one out there but the
07:34 - reason I want to teach blender 3d is
07:35 - because I want to allow all my
07:37 - subscribers to follow along with my
07:39 - tutorials and if I taught you know one
07:41 - of the expensive 3d modeling programs
07:43 - then they wouldn't be able to follow
07:45 - along because when I was in high school
07:47 - in college I was broke and I know that a
07:50 - lot of you guys probably can't afford
07:51 - you know a huge 34 thousand dollar
07:54 - program so that's why I was like alright
07:56 - even though it's not the best I'm gonna
07:58 - teach blender 3d because all my
08:00 - subscribers are gonna be able to follow
08:01 - along with it so that being said let me
08:04 - tell you guys what I'm doing I decided
08:06 - instead of teaching blender 3d to teach
08:09 - 3dsmax now 3ds max is the best no
08:14 - contest if you had all the money in the
08:16 - world and you could only buy one 3d
08:18 - modeling program you want to choose 3ds
08:21 - max now it's a $3500 program and before
08:27 - I made a couple tutorials about it and I
08:29 - was like you know what
08:30 - who's gonna be able to afford this
08:31 - program you know probably none of the
08:33 - people that are watching my tutorials so
08:34 - I kind of stopped making stories about
08:36 - it but I'm gonna start making tutorials
08:39 - on 3ds max because it is the best
08:42 - program for computer game character
08:44 - modeling anything you need for a
08:46 - computer game you can create in 3ds max
08:48 - it's a whole lot better than blender I
08:51 - know a lot of you you know hardcore
08:53 - blender fans are probably gonna disagree
08:55 - with me but trust me it's like you know
08:57 - how Photoshop is the best photo editing
09:00 - program and then you know some people
09:02 - say is free it's awesome well
09:04 - that's kind of how this is 3ds max is
09:06 - the best it's an industry standard when
09:09 - it comes a computer game development and
09:11 - you know blender is a pretty good
09:13 - program but you know it doesn't it's
09:15 - leaps and bounds below 3ds max so that
09:19 - being said let me tell you guys what I
09:20 - found out yesterday that's why I was
09:23 - gonna teach blender 3d because it's free
09:25 - and everyone could follow along even
09:26 - though it wasn't best but yesterday I
09:28 - found out that if you are a student in
09:31 - high school or college you can go to the
09:33 - Autodesk web and by the way Autodesk is
09:35 - who makes 3ds max you can go to the
09:38 - Autodesk website register and all that
09:41 - means is you need to enter your email
09:42 - telling me you're a student and you know
09:44 - make a account a password and stuff and
09:46 - you could download all their software
09:48 - they have for free I'm not talking a
09:51 - 30-day trial I'm not talking some crappy
09:53 - toned down version of the software I'm
09:55 - talking if you are student you can
09:58 - download the entire 3ds max
10:01 - $3500 program for free and I was like oh
10:04 - my god why did I not know about this
10:07 - before and it kind of makes sense why
10:09 - they're doing this because they want
10:10 - students to learn 3ds max because then
10:13 - when they jump into the computer game
10:15 - development industry or 3d modeling
10:17 - industry there
10:19 - have those skills in you know the
10:21 - companies they work for they're not
10:22 - students they still have to buy the
10:24 - program so it kind of makes sense why
10:26 - they're doing this letting students to
10:28 - learn on it and use it for free and then
10:30 - when they jump into the workforce
10:31 - they're gonna have to buy their program
10:33 - but for us being students it's all there
10:36 - at our fingertips for free the best most
10:39 - amazing 3d modeling program out there
10:41 - and you know just this is kind of
10:43 - getting on my chest I know a lot of you
10:44 - guys are gonna say well Maya is the best
10:47 - 3d modeling program well Maya is the
10:49 - best program for like movies and
10:51 - animations and logos but for character
10:54 - design 3ds max is the best like I said
10:57 - if I had ten million dollars and I can
10:59 - only build and I could only buy one 3d
11:01 - modelling program it would be 3ds max so
11:03 - this is not up for debate
11:05 - that's what we're doing so that's why I
11:08 - chose to use 3ds max in Unreal Engine
11:11 - rather than blender and over like I said
11:14 - guys if we want to develop the best
11:16 - games we need to have the best skills
11:18 - and use the best tools so no need
11:21 - thinking around with this you know a
11:22 - little kind of cool computer game stuff
11:25 - if we want to develop the best computer
11:28 - games ever made and that's what I plan
11:30 - to teach you guys how to do we're gonna
11:31 - need the best programs out there so
11:33 - that's what I'm gonna be doing so I hope
11:35 - you guys understand my decision in the
11:38 - long run it's gonna be better for you
11:39 - guys and by the way like I said just
11:42 - like Unreal Engine is the industry
11:44 - standard and so all the pros use when
11:46 - you're looking for a job if you know 3ds
11:48 - max good you're gonna be able to get a
11:50 - job like that it's what all the huge
11:52 - companies use and you know like I said
11:55 - I'm gonna stop rambling right now but
11:57 - that's why I made my decision I hope you
11:59 - guys understand so um let me think if I
12:03 - have anything else to say I think that's
12:04 - it so I hope you guys uh you know are
12:07 - looking forward to this game development
12:09 - is much as I am because I cannot wait
12:11 - I'm probably going to start these
12:13 - tutorials
12:15 - I want to say like four or five days is
12:17 - when you're gonna see these tutorials
12:19 - start pumping out I don't know if I'm
12:21 - going to be teaching 3ds max I kind of I
12:23 - really want to jump into a Unreal Engine
12:26 - because it's just so awesome and I love
12:28 - using it but I don't know if I should
12:30 - teach 3ds max because you know you kind
12:33 - of need the 3d stuff before he can build
12:35 - a game you can't like build a game
12:37 - without the 3d objects but you can build
12:39 - 3d objects without a game so I might
12:41 - have to teach 3ds max but uh I really
12:44 - want to teach Unreal Engine so I'm not
12:46 - sure what I'm gonna be doing but that is
12:49 - what I need to tell you guys that's my
12:50 - decision and I hope you guys are excited
12:53 - for it and understand where I'm coming
12:54 - from so thank you guys for watching and
12:56 - don't forget like I said at the
12:57 - beginning my website is now updated so
13:00 - all my tutorials are on there and a nice
13:02 - neat playlist for you guys so again one
13:05 - last time thank you guys for watching
13:06 - thank you guys so much for subscribing
13:07 - and donating you guys have no idea how
13:10 - much it means to me so uh think you
13:12 - think you think you and I will see you
13:14 - in about a couple days when I start
13:16 - making stories
