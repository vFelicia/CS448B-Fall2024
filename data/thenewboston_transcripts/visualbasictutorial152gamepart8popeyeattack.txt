00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - continue working on the game so if you
00:11 - remember from the previous tutorial we
00:12 - created the button attack event and
00:15 - whatever you click attack it will attack
00:19 - the enemy so let's go ahead come up here
00:24 - to form one and we never form one loads
00:26 - we'll just go ahead and set progress bar
00:30 - Popeye dot value equals hero dot health
00:41 - and you can see that health doesn't show
00:44 - up by there so we need to come over here
00:45 - to the Popeye class and we need to
00:50 - create a public property
00:54 - so public property health as integer go
01:01 - ahead and and hit enter and if we just
01:04 - type set we get set and our get all
01:07 - these can be in any order you would like
01:09 - so in our case we have set before so
01:12 - whenever we get it we will return int
01:14 - health and whenever we set it value or
01:18 - no int health will equal value so now
01:27 - that we have our health property let's
01:31 - go ahead come back in to form one BB and
01:34 - you can see that this works fine so
01:38 - whenever they use their spinach what we
01:41 - want to do is we want to update this
01:46 - label right here so we'll come back into
01:50 - form one BB and once it takes out the
01:52 - spinach we will just type we will set
01:55 - the label so label spinach left dot text
01:59 - is going to be equal to
02:00 - spinach left and then we'll go ahead and
02:04 - add int spinach dot to string so we just
02:10 - convert it to a string to display it on
02:12 - the forum so if you remember remember
02:17 - from the previous tutorial if the health
02:19 - drops below zero we will get an error
02:21 - and if the program will freeze up and
02:24 - stop working because a progress bar bar
02:26 - cannot have a value of less than zero so
02:29 - we'll go ahead and use an if statement
02:32 - or not an if statement let's go ahead
02:34 - and use a try statement so try it's
02:38 - gonna go ahead and try to set this
02:39 - program progress bar and we'll go ahead
02:42 - and catch that exception so if we get an
02:45 - exception saying it's below then what we
02:47 - want to do is tell the user that they
02:51 - have one so we will just type message
02:59 - box dot show pop I has one and after
03:09 - we've shown that what we want to do is
03:11 - generate another enemy so it will just
03:15 - generate enemy there so that the user
03:17 - has a new enemy to fight once he has one
03:22 - so let's go ahead and try this out and
03:26 - see if everything works fine so you can
03:28 - see that we have both progress bars are
03:30 - at their fullest and let's go ahead and
03:34 - attack you can see that it takes away
03:36 - some health we can attack again we can
03:39 - keep attacking we can use spinach and
03:42 - you can see that says we have two left
03:43 - then we have one left and we have zero
03:46 - left and you can see that it says Popeye
03:50 - has one now let's go ahead and if
03:53 - spinach left equals zero and we'll just
03:55 - disable this radio button so we will go
04:01 - ahead and come down here to button
04:04 - attack and if it's checked and in
04:06 - spinach is equal to zero
04:08 - I mean greater than zero then we'll do
04:10 - that but else if in spinach equals zero
04:18 - then what do we want to do we want to
04:21 - type radio'
04:23 - spinach dot enabled equals false so
04:29 - we'll go ahead and run this we can use
04:35 - spinach
04:36 - so one two we've got one left we've got
04:38 - 0 left you can see that it's gonna
04:40 - disable it for us but it disabled it
04:46 - after so what we what we need to do is
04:51 - let's go ahead and copy this right here
04:53 - and we will put it as the first thing
04:58 - that happens when this button is clicked
04:59 - so if in spinach equals zero then what
05:07 - do we want to do well we will just go
05:11 - ahead and uncheck that radio button so
05:14 - radio spinach dot checked equals false
05:19 - so it's going to uncheck it for us and
05:21 - then we'll go ahead and disable it dot
05:24 - enabled equals false so we will take
05:31 - this out right here and now let's go
05:34 - ahead and run this and see that we've
05:38 - got new spinach we got two left we got
05:40 - one left
05:41 - we've got 0 left and then if we click it
05:45 - it disables it and unchecked it for us
05:47 - you can see that the enemy still has
05:50 - some health left so we keep attacking
05:53 - it says Popeye has one ok so now all we
06:01 - need to do is we need to have the enemy
06:04 - fight back after every time it has been
06:06 - attacked so we'll come over here to our
06:10 - toolbox and let's go ahead and add a
06:14 - timer
06:17 - so we'll go ahead and look for one
06:20 - here's a timer right here and we will
06:23 - minimize the toolbox so here's our timer
06:27 - we want to set the name to timer delay
06:31 - and we'll set the interval to one second
06:34 - or 1000 milliseconds so let's go ahead
06:39 - and double click on timer delay tick and
06:42 - so whenever they attack what we want to
06:44 - do is we want to start the timer so we
06:50 - will just type timer delay dot start so
06:58 - the timer's going to start every time
06:59 - they attack but when you do enclose this
07:04 - inside of this try-catch statement so
07:07 - that if the enemy has been defeated it
07:10 - won't start that timer so now whenever
07:12 - the timer click whenever the timer ticks
07:15 - what we want to do is make the enemy
07:19 - attack
