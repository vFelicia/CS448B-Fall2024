00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 33rd XHTML and CSS story and in this
00:05 - tutorial we're gonna be talking about
00:06 - something called pseudo elements but the
00:09 - name pseudo element I don't know why
00:10 - they give that name because it's not
00:12 - really even a fake element at all it's
00:15 - basically just a piece of another
00:17 - element so for example a pseudo element
00:21 - for example might be if you have a
00:23 - paragraph it might just be the first
00:25 - line of the paragraph or if you have a
00:27 - header it might just be the first letter
00:30 - of that title or whatever section of
00:32 - text yet so you see it's not really like
00:34 - a fake element it's just like the
00:36 - beginning of another element so I know
00:38 - you guys it's really hard to explain it
00:41 - so I'm just gonna show you guys what it
00:42 - is so let's go ahead and make three
00:45 - paragraphs because I'm gonna be styling
00:47 - the first letter of each paragraph so
00:50 - you know might as well have more than
00:51 - one so um let me just go ahead and make
00:55 - three outlines four paragraphs right now
00:58 - pp head it's disgusting and paste and
01:03 - paste so let's just go ahead and alright
01:05 - what's popping in my head
01:06 - Paul did you hear Miley Cyrus played
01:10 - beer pong with the Russians yeah I never
01:14 - took typing class as a kid so yeah and
01:18 - then just write something and next one
01:20 - like OMG WTF BBQ and in the last one
01:24 - just write like Oh Billy Oh Billy okay
01:29 - so anyways let's go ahead and save that
01:31 - and take a look at what we got it so far
01:33 - three paragraphs basically pretty dumb
01:36 - so anyways what I wanted to teach you
01:39 - guys is about these pseudo elements and
01:41 - how to apply styles to them first of all
01:45 - a pseudo element would be the first
01:47 - letter of each of these paragraphs and
01:50 - you don't get to pick um these pseudo
01:53 - elements are actually built-in and the
01:54 - ones that are built-in I know by heart
01:56 - our first letter first line for example
02:00 - if you had a paragraph with like five
02:01 - lines it would only apply the style to
02:03 - that first line and there's also one be
02:06 - called there's also one book called what
02:08 - the heck am I saying there's also one
02:10 - called before
02:12 - after and I actually never use these so
02:14 - I'm not even entirely sure that they are
02:16 - but I know that they exist because I
02:18 - read about it before so anyways what I'm
02:21 - gonna be doing is applying a style to
02:23 - the first letter of each paragraph and
02:24 - in order to use these pseudo elements
02:26 - you do this go ahead and type the main
02:28 - element that you want to apply and then
02:31 - go ahead and add a colon and type the
02:33 - name of the pseudo element now in this
02:35 - case it's first - letter and again you
02:40 - don't get to make these up these are
02:41 - actually built-in so again there's first
02:43 - letter and first-line before and after
02:46 - so now whenever I apply a style it's
02:48 - gonna apply it to the first letter of
02:51 - every paragraph so let's go ahead and
02:54 - well let's go ahead and make a style so
02:57 - font-weight:bold good and on but like
03:03 - font size 30 pixels I always choose 30
03:07 - pixels I'm not sure why and just make it
03:10 - color green that looks pretty good
03:13 - and from that semicolon instead of colon
03:16 - now refresh it and let's see we got now
03:20 - we have a style apply to the first
03:22 - letter of the first paragraph P oh and
03:26 - oh and it's supposed to so that's pretty
03:28 - nice so anyways that's what pseudo
03:31 - elements are and that's how you can use
03:33 - CSS to apply styles to them now again in
03:37 - this example it wasn't really useful but
03:39 - uh you know you get the idea if you ever
03:41 - want to apply a style to make the first
03:43 - letter or first line stand out this is
03:46 - how you would do that so anyways that's
03:47 - all I got for you guys for this tutorial
03:49 - thank you guys for watching and I'll see
03:50 - you next video
