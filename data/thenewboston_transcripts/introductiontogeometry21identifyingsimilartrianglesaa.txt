00:00 - our Focus today is identifying similar
00:04 - triangles and we're going to do that
00:06 - through this AA
00:11 - property so AA or angle angle is when
00:15 - you have two angles of one triangle
00:17 - congruent to two angles of another
00:18 - triangle and if this is true you can say
00:23 - therefore the triangles are
00:36 - similar so using AA we're going to do
00:40 - some
00:41 - examples so the directions are find the
00:44 - missing angles then state if the
00:46 - triangles are
00:49 - similar so first in order to find X we
00:54 - have to set
00:57 - these we have to add these together and
00:59 - set the total equal to
01:05 - 180 so if we add these two together we
01:08 - get x +
01:11 - 144 = 180 if we subtract that over we
01:15 - get X is equal to
01:20 - 36° so now we do the same
01:23 - thing over
01:27 - here y +
01:31 - 36 +
01:32 - 66 =
01:36 - 180
01:41 - y+ 102 =
01:44 - 180 so y =
01:52 - 78
01:55 - okay
01:57 - 78 so we know that y 78 so this angle is
02:02 - congruent with this angle we know X is
02:05 - equal to
02:06 - 36 and this angle over here is also
02:09 - equal to 36 so those two are
02:13 - congruent so
02:15 - therefore
02:17 - triangles are
02:20 - similar
02:22 - by angle
02:26 - angle and even though we know that
02:33 - that this and this is also congruent all
02:38 - we need to know is that two of these are
02:42 - congruent to prove by angle
02:47 - angle so the directions are the same
02:50 - we're going to do that with this new
02:54 - triangle so we know that this is a right
02:57 - angle and a right angle equals
03:01 - 90° this angle
03:05 - 90° so now we're going to use our
03:08 - interior angle
03:12 - properties
03:14 - and set the angles equal to
03:20 - 180 so if you add those get together you
03:23 - get
03:24 - 128 + a = 180 so a is equal to 50
03:31 - 2 so since we know that this is a right
03:35 - angle and this is a right angle that
03:37 - means that these two angles are
03:38 - congruent because all right angles are
03:40 - congruent to one another and we know
03:43 - that this is 52° and
03:46 - this is
03:48 - 52° so we can say therefore
03:52 - triangles are
03:56 - similar by angle angle
04:01 - but we're going to check this
04:04 - one just for some extra
04:08 - practice because it should be
04:11 - congruent to this
04:13 - one so b + 90 +
04:18 - 52 is equal to
04:22 - 180 B
04:26 - plus
04:28 - plus 142 2 =
04:30 - 180 if you subtract this over you get B
04:34 - =
04:35 - 38 so these are
04:37 - also congruent you don't have to know
04:41 - that to prove this you just need two
04:45 - angles but we just went ahead and
04:47 - checked them just for extra
04:50 - proof so we're going
04:55 - to so next lesson we're going to talk
04:57 - about other ways to
05:00 - prove triangles are similar so make sure
05:03 - you check that out
