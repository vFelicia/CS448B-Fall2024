00:00 - what's up guys welcome back to your
00:02 - let's see eighteenth XHTML tutorial and
00:04 - in this tutorial I'm gonna go over the
00:06 - correct way to bold and italicize text
00:09 - so I remember like probably 10 tutorials
00:13 - ago I showed you guys how to bold and
00:14 - italicize text by surrounding them with
00:16 - special tags and while this is indeed a
00:20 - valid way you actually can do that and
00:22 - it will work in most browsers it's not
00:25 - the best way and it's not going to be
00:27 - the way that people do in the future so
00:29 - a better way to bold and italicize text
00:32 - is through CSS anytime you change any
00:36 - element or change any of the properties
00:38 - of XHTML it's better to use CSS other
00:42 - than you know surrounding text with bold
00:44 - tags or something like that so here is a
00:47 - lot better and more modern way I guess
00:49 - you could say of how to make text bold
00:52 - and how to italicize text so let's go
00:55 - ahead and before we can you know start
00:57 - bolding and italicize enough we actually
00:59 - need something to bold so let's go ahead
01:01 - and make two lists um an unordered list
01:04 - and let me just end this and I guess we
01:10 - can just like put one element in there
01:11 - we don't know to need a bunch of
01:13 - elements in there so for the first and
01:16 - only element I'll just put like
01:18 - unordered lists and make sure you spell
01:20 - it dang did I spell that right I'm
01:23 - better not of and let's just go ahead
01:25 - and copy this and what you just want to
01:28 - order it listen since they both have the
01:30 - li we just need to change two letters so
01:34 - we have one unordered list in one order
01:38 - list so we just need I mean you can use
01:40 - paragraphs or headers or whatever you
01:42 - want I just needed something to throw in
01:43 - there so anyways in order to make the
01:47 - style what you need to do is first write
01:50 - what element you want to change
01:51 - unordered list and then you're right
01:53 - what property you want to change the
01:56 - font weight and that is the technical
01:59 - technical term for how thick the font is
02:04 - you can use values I think 500 is the
02:07 - default value so you can use something
02:09 - like 900 800 to make it
02:12 - now if you say you wanted bold you know
02:14 - like varying degrees of boldness I
02:16 - couldn't say but I don't think too many
02:18 - people care that specific how bold they
02:21 - want it I mean did you ever hear a guy
02:23 - says yeah that's bold but I want it
02:26 - bolder you know no one says that
02:28 - so anyways um you can just throw in bold
02:32 - as your value and you know you'll be
02:35 - happy most of the time so let's go ahead
02:38 - and that is you know the proper way I
02:41 - want to say in order to bold font so in
02:44 - order to italicize font go ahead and
02:47 - will italicize that order list we've
02:48 - just made and go ahead and the property
02:51 - is font style and as the style just go
02:56 - ahead and write italic and this is going
02:59 - to italic or italicize any of your
03:02 - ordered lists so let's go ahead and save
03:04 - this and refresh it and see what we get
03:07 - we got one on unordered list that is
03:10 - bolded and one ordered list that is
03:13 - italicized so again like I said while
03:17 - you can technically surround it in those
03:19 - be bold tags or e/m emphasis tags this
03:23 - is a lot easier way and it's the pretty
03:28 - much the correct way to do so that old
03:30 - stuff was kind of old school and this is
03:32 - the new school so get used to this and
03:34 - you'll thank me later on so anyways
03:36 - that's all I have for you guys for this
03:38 - story thank you for watching I'll see
03:39 - you next time
