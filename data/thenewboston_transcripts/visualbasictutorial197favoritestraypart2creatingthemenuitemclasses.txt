00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - continue working on the tray icon or the
00:11 - tray application that will hold our
00:13 - internet favorites so we need to come
00:15 - over here to favorites view or tray and
00:18 - we need to add a class now we'll go
00:23 - ahead and name it web favorite menu item
00:33 - and we'll go ahead and click Add now
00:37 - what we need to do is we need to have
00:38 - web favorite menu item inherit from
00:41 - something so we'll have it inherits menu
00:44 - item it says represents an individual
00:48 - item that is displayed within a system
00:49 - not window stop forums dot main menu or
00:52 - a context menu so basically what this is
00:55 - would be a menu item would be similar to
00:59 - this file right here so when we click
01:01 - file it shows us a menu so we're
01:04 - creating a menu item that will show when
01:06 - they right click the star in the tray so
01:10 - now that it inherits menu item what we
01:13 - need to do is we need to create a
01:16 - favorite
01:17 - so we'll do public favorite as web
01:21 - favorite and you can see here that web
01:25 - favorite is not available to us so we
01:28 - need to come over here to favorites view
01:30 - or tray YouTube we need to go to project
01:33 - and we need to add a reference it so
01:36 - we'll go to projects and we will just
01:38 - add a reference for internet favorites
01:40 - and click OK
01:42 - so now we can do public favorite as web
01:48 - favorite
01:50 - but we need to import that first so
01:54 - imports internet favorites so now that
02:01 - we've imported our class library we can
02:04 - use the web favorite class so now we
02:09 - need to create a constructor so we do
02:11 - this by using public sub new this should
02:14 - be familiar to you and it's going to
02:16 - take one argument so whenever they
02:18 - create an object of this web favorite
02:20 - menu item it's going they're going to
02:22 - have to give it a web favorite for it to
02:25 - construct it properly so it will do by
02:28 - eval new favorite as web favorite and
02:35 - we'll go ahead and press ENTER and it
02:37 - will add in sub for us so now when you
02:40 - do is set favorite which is this right
02:43 - here equal to new favorite so we have
02:49 - this variable that we've created and
02:50 - when they create an instance of this
02:52 - class right here they have to give us a
02:54 - web favorite and then we set the
02:56 - favorite variable in here the public
02:59 - favorite variable to what they have
03:00 - given us so this basically makes a copy
03:03 - of it so that we can use it throughout
03:06 - this class and now we just need to say
03:09 - text equals favorite dot name so text is
03:16 - pretty much the text of the menu item
03:18 - when we because we inherit from menu
03:20 - item we can access the text value so
03:23 - let's say this is our menu item right
03:25 - here at the text value for this it would
03:26 - be new project so we're sending text
03:29 - equal to favorite name and now in our
03:31 - web favorites class let's go ahead and
03:33 - look at that we have the name which is
03:37 - the name of the website so when they
03:39 - right click is going to show the name of
03:40 - the web site and it's not going to
03:41 - actually show the URL so now what we
03:48 - need to do is we need to access the
03:49 - click event of this class now you may be
03:52 - thinking I thought you could only access
03:54 - click events for objects on your form
03:57 - such as buttons text boxes labels link
04:00 - labels but whenever we inherit from
04:03 - new items so let's say this is a menu
04:05 - item right here it can react to itself
04:07 - being clicked so when we click on new
04:09 - project it's going to do something so we
04:11 - need to access the click event of this
04:12 - so what we can do is we can use this
04:15 - combo box right here so when we drop
04:18 - this down you can see that we have web
04:20 - favorite menu item events and we can
04:23 - come over here to the declarations and
04:26 - we have all these events that we can use
04:28 - so we need to select the click event
04:31 - so whenever web favorite menu item is
04:34 - clicked what do we want to do well we'll
04:37 - say if not favorite is nothing then what
04:45 - do we want to do so basically what this
04:46 - saying well this is saying is if
04:49 - favorite is something because we're
04:51 - using a double negative here so if not
04:54 - favorite is nothing so not nothing would
04:56 - be something so if favorite is actually
04:58 - something and not a null value for all
05:01 - you people who've worked with other
05:02 - languages what we want to do is type
05:04 - process dot start and then we'll do
05:08 - favorite dot URL now what this is going
05:13 - to do is it's going to start the process
05:15 - and it's gonna open this URL so when you
05:20 - open URLs when you click on URLs in any
05:22 - program on your computer your computer
05:25 - knows to open this with your default web
05:27 - browser so it's going to start that
05:28 - process and it's going to basically
05:30 - click on that if you want to say that
05:33 - there's going to open this right here
05:35 - and it's going to open it in your
05:36 - default browser so go ahead and put this
05:41 - code in if you haven't already we
05:43 - created a menu item so that we can add a
05:46 - whole bunch of these web favorite menu
05:48 - items to a menu later on so that they
05:51 - can just right click on the star and it
05:53 - will show them all of their favorites
