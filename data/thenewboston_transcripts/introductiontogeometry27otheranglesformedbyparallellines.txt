00:00 - so today we're going to go over the
00:02 - other angles formed by parallel lines
00:05 - and their relationships to one another
00:09 - so when two or more parallel lines but
00:13 - is these two lines right here are cut by
00:18 - a transversal which there's one
00:22 - transversal here and when transversal
00:25 - here their alternate interior angles are
00:28 - congruent and alternate exterior angles
00:33 - are congruent so if you remember what an
00:37 - alternate interior angle is it's just
00:41 - those angles that when you pair them up
00:47 - they form a Z right here their alternate
00:54 - because they alternate what side and
00:56 - what part of the line there on and now
01:03 - we know that they're congruent so I can
01:07 - say that the measure of angle one is 87
01:11 - I can do the same thing this way draw my
01:20 - alternate interior angles with angle 2
01:24 - and this angle right here so that means
01:26 - that angle too is 93 degrees and I can't
01:32 - do that over here because I don't know
01:33 - what these are what these measures are
01:38 - but I can use the other part of this and
01:43 - say that alternate exterior angles are
01:46 - congruent because this and is important
01:49 - because both of these are congruent so
01:53 - we start with angle 3 and I draw my land
01:57 - line down go on to the other side so
02:02 - that means that 3 has to equal 85
02:05 - degrees
02:07 - and I do it the other way starting with
02:12 - 95 going down to 4 that means the
02:19 - measure of angle for has to be 95
02:22 - degrees because I know these angles are
02:25 - congruent so using those two rules we're
02:33 - going to find the missing measurements
02:35 - of this quadrilateral so I know this
02:40 - line will call this ad is parallel to B
02:49 - C and we know that ad is parallel to DC
02:55 - or a be sorry so I want to find the
03:00 - measure of angle 1 well if you look at
03:04 - this BD is the transversal that cuts
03:11 - these two parallel lines and a half so
03:17 - that means that the alternate interior
03:20 - angles of these two lines are congruent
03:25 - so if we start along this first line
03:31 - come down the transversal go over this
03:40 - other parallel line because both of both
03:43 - sets of parallel lines are cut by this
03:45 - transversal I know that a measure of
03:48 - angle one has to be 38 degrees and if I
03:56 - look at these two parallel lines this
04:00 - time instead of these two they're also
04:04 - cut by this transversal BD so I'm going
04:08 - to start because I know their alternate
04:11 - interior angles are congruent so I'm
04:13 - going to start with this first parallel
04:14 - line come down the transversal BD and go
04:19 - over to this pair
04:20 - line and that means angle 2 has to be 86
04:24 - degrees because they have their
04:26 - congruent which means they have equal
04:28 - measures so we have one more example
04:31 - we're going to do so find the missing
04:36 - measurements so this is what we need to
04:43 - find so the first thing we're going to
04:47 - do is find out what this what this
04:53 - measure angle equals because then I can
04:58 - use my supplementary my knowledge of
05:02 - supplementary angles to find out what
05:04 - the measure of angle 23 is
05:15 - okay so i can find this out because i
05:20 - know that these two lines are parallel
05:23 - they're cut by this transversal so that
05:28 - their alternate interior angles are
05:31 - congruent so I mean this has to be 65
05:35 - degrees as well so now that I know what
05:38 - that ain't gold equals I can use my
05:41 - supplementary not my knowledge of some
05:43 - supplementary angles set 23 this is
05:48 - angle 23 not the number 23 plus fit plus
05:53 - 65 equals 180 if i subtract the 65 / i
06:00 - get angle 23 equals 115 okay so if you
06:09 - notice these marks right here this means
06:12 - that these two angles are congruent so
06:17 - this has to equal 65 as well and if you
06:21 - look this angle and this angle are also
06:25 - supplementary so we're going to do the
06:28 - same thing to 25 angle 25 + 65 equals
06:36 - 180 so angle 25 also has to equal 115
06:42 - degrees
06:48 - so out round 1 115 degrees so last if I
07:01 - look at these two parallel lines here
07:05 - they're cut by this transversal so that
07:09 - means that they are alternate interior
07:16 - angles are congruent so if I start here
07:21 - on this parallel line come down the
07:24 - transversal and go across I know that 6
07:27 - that 24 has to equal 65 degrees so
07:34 - that's it for parallel lines but make
07:37 - sure you come back and check out the
07:39 - videos on polygons next
