00:00 - hi there i'm alex from PHP academy' and
00:03 - this is another video tutorial produced
00:05 - for the new boston this time we're going
00:07 - to be talking about the print language
00:11 - construct in PHP now you can see that I
00:14 - am using the previous echo example here
00:18 - from the previous video talking about
00:20 - echoing out data to the users browser or
00:23 - string data to the users browser now
00:26 - print does not differ whatsoever just
00:30 - for the purposes of this tutorial I'm
00:32 - going to just change this text to hello
00:35 - with an exclamation mark so I'm also
00:39 - going to change this to print you can
00:42 - see my text editor has highlighted this
00:43 - blue again so we can see that this is
00:46 - this is a language construct and it's
00:49 - still valid however when we refresh we
00:52 - get exactly the same result as we do
00:54 - with echo now you may be thinking while
00:57 - they're two different now print works
01:02 - slightly different to echo in the way
01:06 - that it is an actually an older way to
01:11 - in a more sort of traditional way if you
01:13 - like to print data out basically I mean
01:19 - to the browser in this case so it's also
01:22 - slower to use and an echo and if you
01:25 - wanted to be really petty it also has
01:28 - more characters so people tend to find
01:30 - it's quicker to use echo also when we're
01:32 - using print traditionally we would use
01:36 - brackets as it behaves more like a
01:38 - function even though it still is a
01:40 - language construct so basically in short
01:44 - it's a lot better to use echo and the
01:48 - main reason for this is it being a lot
01:49 - quicker using less system resources so
01:52 - even though you can use print and later
01:55 - on in the tutorial series we will come
01:57 - across things like print are which
02:00 - aren't in fact
02:02 - too tightly related to print itself but
02:06 - you will maybe come across print at some
02:09 - point in programs however if you're
02:11 - programming sort of from now on we're
02:14 - going to be using echo and it's probably
02:16 - better to use echo as well
