00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your let's see what tutorial
00:04 - does 51st I think udk tutorial and in
00:08 - this tutorial actually in the upcoming
00:09 - tutorials what I'm going to be teaching
00:11 - you guys is going to be awesome I'm
00:14 - finally going to kind of step away from
00:16 - putting the pieces together in the
00:18 - visual aspect of our game and we're
00:20 - going to be hopping into the dynamic
00:22 - aspect of our game how the player can
00:24 - interact with the environment and in
00:26 - this first tutorial I'm going to be
00:28 - teaching you guys how you can cause
00:29 - damage to the environment and how the
00:32 - environment can realize that it's taking
00:34 - damage and respond to it in a certain
00:36 - way however you want to do so before I
00:38 - happen to that let me just mention that
00:40 - i'm using the map that we use before
00:43 - however I cleared everything out of it
00:45 - basically so now all we have is just
00:47 - plain old static meshes this wall this
00:50 - podium this wall right here in a control
00:52 - panel and remember we had a trigger
00:55 - right in front here I deleted that and I
00:57 - also had a bunch of stuff in kismet I
00:59 - went and deleted that so basically we
01:01 - have a blank map so don't think you know
01:04 - I set everything up beforehand because I
01:05 - did it so now let me go ahead and the
01:09 - very first thing I want to teach you
01:10 - guys is how you can shoot this control
01:13 - panel right here and how it can realize
01:15 - that you shot it and you know respond in
01:18 - a certain way maybe send some enemies
01:20 - out to you or you know do whatever it
01:22 - wants to do so now let me go ahead and
01:24 - select this control panel right here and
01:27 - I'm going to go ahead and hop in kismet
01:29 - and actually before I even continue I
01:31 - want to mention this I'm going to be
01:33 - moving a little bit faster from now on
01:36 - because now that we know the interface
01:38 - of the UDK and we kind of know how
01:41 - everything is pieced together generally
01:43 - when making the game I'm gonna be taking
01:46 - things up a little bit faster because I
01:48 - think it's time that you know like I
01:50 - said we start to move a little bit
01:51 - faster but I'm definitely not going to
01:53 - be leaving you guys behind I just want
01:55 - to mention that I think it's time we
01:56 - move a little bit quicker and if you
01:58 - guys get lost in you have any questions
02:00 - don't forget to ask me I'm when I form
02:02 - the new boston.com / forum and I'll be
02:04 - glad to answer them for you then but
02:06 - like I said it's time to kind of step
02:08 - away from the beginner putting the
02:09 - pieces together and we
02:11 - in to the more advanced stuff so go
02:13 - ahead and select this control panel
02:15 - right here and open kismet and I first
02:19 - want to introduce you guys to a new type
02:22 - of event so before the only event we
02:24 - knew was the trigger event so now with
02:27 - your control panel selected go ahead and
02:29 - right click and hit new event using
02:32 - static static mesh actor and I'm going
02:35 - to hit take damage and now we see we now
02:39 - have a take damage event in your saying
02:42 - all right what the heck is a take damage
02:45 - event well you can apply these take
02:47 - damage effects to the stack meshes and
02:50 - now what's going to happen is in your
02:52 - game this static mesh right here it's
02:54 - going to be waiting for you to do damage
02:56 - to it either shooting it with a gun or
02:59 - running up and kicking it with your foot
03:01 - or hitting it with a sword anytime you
03:04 - do damage to it it's going to output a
03:07 - signal so again aside from just flicking
03:10 - a trigger on and off you can also have
03:12 - these static mesh damages where whenever
03:15 - this object right here takes damage and
03:17 - we're going to be shooting it with our
03:19 - gun it's going to output the signal but
03:21 - say you're making a game in you have the
03:24 - player able to damage in a bunch of
03:27 - different ways you give them you know
03:28 - maybe if they bump into the object that
03:31 - does one damage maybe if they punch it
03:33 - does five damage if they shoot it with a
03:35 - gun it does 60 damage or if they shoot
03:37 - it with you know a cannon it does like
03:39 - 500 damage well we don't want this to go
03:42 - off with you know just a little bump or
03:44 - anything like that so we're going to
03:46 - want to go ahead and set this damage
03:48 - threshold down to you know something
03:49 - like five or ten or something like that
03:53 - because if we set it too high like 500
03:56 - then we're never going to be able to set
03:59 - the signal off because we're going to
04:01 - need you know a nuclear bomb but if we
04:03 - set it something to you know point five
04:05 - or you know one then anytime we bump
04:08 - into it it's going to go off so set it
04:10 - equal to something like five and then
04:12 - whenever we shoot it with a gun is going
04:14 - to respond so basically whenever we do
04:17 - damage to this and we're going to be
04:18 - shooting it with a gun it's going to
04:20 - output something and something is going
04:21 - to happen so just for the sake of this
04:23 - story
04:24 - just going to make a real quick
04:25 - announcement play so I'm going to go
04:27 - ahead and hit new action um I'll just
04:31 - write a regular in the house when I
04:32 - guess play announcement so now whenever
04:35 - I do damage to it a gay issue with a gun
04:37 - and announcement is going to play so now
04:39 - let me change the properties of the
04:41 - announcement and the text is going to be
04:42 - like WTF Bucky don't shoot me with an
04:48 - explanation point so now let me go ahead
04:50 - and X out of this and I might as well x
04:53 - out of this and hop over into right
04:56 - there and check it out you need to
04:59 - right-click this because if you left
05:01 - click it it's not going to work so go
05:04 - ahead and right click with your mouse
05:05 - and look what happens it says WTF lucky
05:08 - don't shoot me and again if we do it
05:12 - more than once it isn't going to go off
05:14 - again so it's only going to go off one
05:16 - time and the reason for that is if
05:19 - you're wondering what's going on in this
05:21 - take damage event that happens you're
05:23 - going to have a property let me find
05:25 - this is max trigger count and it says
05:28 - how many times can this event be
05:30 - activated 0 for infinite well we only
05:32 - want it to be activated one time because
05:35 - we're just going to look at it this way
05:36 - once we shoot at one time then it's
05:39 - ruined we can't use it anymore so again
05:41 - you can go ahead and set to zero and
05:44 - this will make it so every time you
05:46 - shoot it it'll say what did we put WTF
05:49 - lucky you don't shoot me but I'm going
05:50 - to go ahead and you usually want to set
05:52 - them to 1 because usually when you
05:55 - destroy something you know it gives you
05:57 - a signal or it locks the door or you
06:00 - know turns on the light and that's it
06:02 - you shoot at one time and is over so I
06:04 - just want to explain it to you guys
06:06 - because in these tutorials I'm going to
06:07 - be keeping it one but if you want to
06:09 - change it for your game that's how you
06:10 - change it so for now I just want to you
06:13 - know give you a little piece of this
06:14 - tutorial because in the next tutorial
06:16 - we're going to be adding some more
06:17 - static meshes and I'm going to be
06:19 - showing you guys a really cool feature
06:21 - but for now that's how you guys get so
06:23 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
06:24 - subscribe and I'll see you guys next
06:26 - time
