00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:07 - talking about a major logical error that
00:10 - was in the previous tutorial now if you
00:14 - remember for the enemy it's going to
00:17 - access current enemy attacks at the
00:20 - index of current enemy attack none now
00:24 - you can see for each one the enemies we
00:26 - have different attack array so we got
00:31 - zombie attacks we've got villain attacks
00:34 - and other stuff so what we need to do is
00:38 - make all of these just attacks now you
00:42 - can see that we're gonna get an error
00:43 - because we already have attacks in our
00:46 - enemy class now we can easily fix this
00:50 - so since each of our villains only has
00:52 - three attacks we can create public read
00:55 - only attacks with three indexes as a
00:58 - string and now for each one of those
01:02 - indexes we're gonna have to add an
01:05 - attack so attacks at index of zero it's
01:13 - gonna be equal to eat brains
01:16 - I don't know how I didn't notice this
01:19 - you know in the last tutorial I guess I
01:22 - didn't really look at the log very
01:24 - closely when we were testing it so they
01:27 - all said this one two claw and we'll do
01:30 - attacks 2 is going to equal throw up
01:40 - okay so now that we have the indexes in
01:44 - our attacks what we need to do is make
01:46 - that for each one of the classes I'll
01:49 - pause and come back once that's finished
01:52 - okay so now that that has finished you
01:55 - can see that I've got the I've added the
01:59 - items to the array in zombies dragon and
02:05 - villain VB so now we can come into form
02:11 - 1 DB and let's see here we've got
02:14 - attacks and then attack num and then
02:17 - attack damage and you can see that we
02:21 - made attack damage in the same way that
02:23 - we did attacks now let's come back here
02:26 - to enemy and we'll just take this out to
02:30 - make sure that nothing bad happens so we
02:33 - got public override herbal sub attack
02:35 - and then you use your health so we can
02:38 - do is we can just get rid of all of this
02:40 - because we have overridden this sub in
02:42 - each and every single one of our other
02:44 - classes that inherit from enemy this
02:46 - doesn't have to have anything in it it's
02:47 - just there that so that we can use it so
02:50 - let's say for example we have current
02:52 - enemy of type enemy we wouldn't be able
02:55 - to call current enemy attack if it
02:57 - wasn't declared an enemy and because
02:59 - it's over rideable and we've overridden
03:00 - it in every single one of the classes
03:02 - all we have to do is just leave an empty
03:04 - sub in here
03:05 - so it's there for us to use but it's
03:06 - already overwritten so let's go ahead
03:11 - and run this and hopefully we won't get
03:13 - any errors and let's see here got event
03:18 - logger
03:18 - go ahead and shrink it down a little bit
03:20 - so we can attack it says anchor throw
03:22 - you can see that zombie has used claw
03:25 - punch claw anchor throw eat brains for
03:30 - 10 damage anchor throw eat brains for
03:33 - another 10 damage punch claw for 5 claw
03:38 - for 5
03:41 - and could throw for 15 another claw once
03:44 - again we got eat brains kick and you can
03:55 - see that Popeye has won so let's go
03:59 - ahead and close out of this and we will
04:02 - close out of that right there let's just
04:04 - go ahead and make sure that everything
04:07 - works fine so you see that we didn't get
04:10 - any throw-ups here so let's see what
04:13 - went wrong we need to make this with a
04:17 - max value of 293 so that it will
04:21 - generate 0 1 or 2 now let's just make
04:24 - sure we've done that in each one of
04:25 - these classes surprise I've never found
04:29 - that error but we'll go into zombie
04:32 - zombies fixed and we need to fix villain
04:36 - here so apparently the whole time um it
04:41 - hasn't been ever going to case 2 so now
04:46 - that we've got all that sorted it out
04:48 - let's go into form 1 now I know I might
04:51 - get some comments from people not liking
04:53 - that I'm getting errors and then I have
04:54 - to fix them but other people especially
04:56 - people from my channel that have washed
04:58 - they said I like it when I find errors
05:01 - and teach you guys ways to fix them and
05:03 - how you can incorporate that in your own
05:05 - programs okay so when the enemy attacks
05:10 - if Popeye is lost let's go ahead and add
05:13 - that to the log so new log dot add event
05:23 - and we just want to say Popeye has lost
05:34 - and just to make this more noticeable
05:38 - we'll go ahead and do new log dot add
05:45 - event and then we'll just separate this
05:49 - from the rest of the stuff that is in
05:51 - this log so copy this one more time you
05:56 - can see that it's gonna say Popeyes lost
05:58 - and it's gonna separate it from the rest
06:00 - so we'll do that once again for button
06:02 - attack and let's go ahead add that right
06:08 - there and then new log dot add event and
06:14 - then we'll add Popeye has one and then
06:21 - we'll add this right here so going so
06:23 - let's go ahead and run this you see that
06:26 - here is our form 1 and our event lager
06:30 - so let's go ahead and spawn a zombie so
06:34 - go ahead and click attack says he use
06:36 - anchor throw and then the zombie threw
06:39 - up on me for a to damage you can attack
06:42 - again anchor through it one more time
06:44 - you can see that's logging everything
06:46 - that's happening let's wait for Popeye
06:52 - to win here
06:53 - see it says Popeye has won and then down
06:57 - here it adds an event to our log that
07:02 - says Popeye has won so go ahead and
07:08 - close out of that let's go ahead and fix
07:11 - these logic errors that we have then
07:14 - once you've done that and put all that
07:15 - code in if you have any comments leave
07:17 - them in the comment section and if not
07:19 - go ahead and move on to the next
07:21 - tutorial
