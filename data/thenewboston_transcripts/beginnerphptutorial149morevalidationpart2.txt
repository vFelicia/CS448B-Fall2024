00:00 - so let's make the change to the last one
00:02 - oh no I've done that again when we take
00:08 - that array from there so it can be a bit
00:11 - fiddly when you're writing all on one
00:13 - line but you'll get used to it
00:16 - eventually so I've just missed that all
00:19 - right now okay so let's go back and
00:22 - refresh ok so we've solved the two
00:26 - visible problems that we have now let me
00:29 - just go ahead and register another user
00:33 - so say Craig password pass one two three
00:39 - I've got my database up here so I can I
00:42 - can click on my users and check how
00:46 - we're doing here
00:46 - so password pass one two three pass
00:50 - password oh no sorry pass one two three
00:54 - first name Craig now let's let's have a
00:58 - look in our database at the length of
01:01 - the surname so let's click on structure
01:04 - and see how many characters we have so
01:06 - we're storing this as a variable
01:08 - character data type with 40 characters
01:11 - maximum 40 characters so what happens if
01:14 - we would just say let's just say m 1 2 3
01:20 - 4 5 6 we'll do it another way
01:23 - we'll say ABCD efg that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
01:31 - EF sorry ABCD efg hijk 6 7 8 9 10 11 so
01:39 - we can get rid of okay so we've got 10
01:41 - characters here and then the reason I'm
01:45 - doing it in as the alphabet is just so
01:48 - you can keep an eye on what's happening
01:49 - so let me copy and paste that 4 times or
01:53 - 3 more times so we've got three
01:56 - instances now of this now what happens
01:59 - or four instances of this we've got ABC
02:03 - up to j and ABC up to j and ABC up to j
02:07 - and then ABC up station we've got for
02:09 - lots of this this is 40 characters long
02:11 - so when we click register they see
02:13 - is going to be able to this is going to
02:17 - fit inside our surname field in our
02:19 - database however what happens if we
02:22 - let's say go back to our form and we
02:26 - copy and paste it in one more time now
02:28 - that's going to equal I've copied and
02:29 - pasted it in another time so we've got
02:31 - ABC up to J - J - J - J up to J so we've
02:37 - got five instances of this same text so
02:41 - we've got 50 characters overall now
02:43 - let's click register you've registered
02:46 - so everything's appears to have worked
02:48 - correctly now let's go and browse our
02:50 - table and we'll come down we can see
02:54 - that out our use names being popped in
02:56 - now we need to I'm going to click on
03:02 - this so little edit button and I'm going
03:04 - to have a look at what's been stored
03:05 - here so we've got ABC up to J ABC up to
03:09 - J ABC up to J and ABC up to J now we've
03:12 - only stored 40 of the 50 characters we
03:15 - entered and the reason for this is our
03:17 - varchar' only allows for 40 characters
03:20 - as we've already looked at under the
03:22 - structure tab so what we need to do is
03:25 - when we're registering the user we need
03:27 - to look at checking up here we need to
03:33 - check how many characters each of these
03:36 - are not including the password because
03:38 - that's hash to a 32 character hash
03:41 - anyway using the md5 functions we don't
03:43 - need to worry about the password it's
03:45 - just the username first name is surname
03:47 - that we need to check and we do have one
03:49 - other issue with the database which is
03:51 - usernames if I was to now register a
03:54 - username
03:55 - let's say with the username Craig but
03:58 - with a small C this is going to be
04:01 - allowed by this is going to be allowed
04:04 - by our by our code the reason being is
04:07 - we're not we're not talking about I
04:09 - don't yeah we're not we're not we're not
04:11 - look at what we're looking at case
04:13 - sensitive comparison so if I was to
04:17 - register a user on here called Craig
04:18 - let's go back to the register page with
04:22 - a small say
04:29 - and Craig a more just pet I don't know
04:32 - Garrett okay Malcolm okay so now let's
04:38 - click register Oh No using Craig already
04:42 - exists maybe okay yeah maybe maybe I'm
04:49 - wrong in that sense then so we've got
04:50 - yeah okay so we don't need to worry
04:53 - about that so let's just focus on this
04:55 - maximum character amount we have so what
04:58 - we first are all going to do is edit our
04:59 - HTML form to only allow a maximum value
05:03 - to be submitted on the form and this
05:07 - isn't an entirely protect against
05:10 - inputting masses of data because we're
05:14 - only allowing in that within the HTML
05:16 - obviously someone could take your HTML
05:19 - page they could change this to your
05:21 - server so your your your domain and then
05:25 - the URL that registers locator and they
05:27 - could submit the data from you know a
05:29 - local PC their own PC so what we need to
05:34 - do is we need to change the these fields
05:37 - to have a max value first then we need
05:40 - to check the length in PHP as well so
05:42 - let's give it a property max length and
05:46 - for username let's just refer back to
05:49 - our database so we know exactly what we
05:51 - what the lengths we're dealing with so
05:57 - we've got 30 for the username 32 for the
05:59 - password like I said we don't need to
06:01 - worry about like the hashes more or less
06:03 - always going to be 32 characters and
06:04 - then 40 and 40 for the first image sir
