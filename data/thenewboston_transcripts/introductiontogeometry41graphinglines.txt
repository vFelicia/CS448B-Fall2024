00:01 - So today we're going to be
00:04 - graphing so our first method of graphing
00:07 - is plotting
00:08 - points so we have this equation y = 2x +
00:12 - 1 we're going to pick these Five Points
00:17 - no particular reason I just wanted you
00:19 - guys to get a good look at what this
00:21 - graph looks like we're going to plug
00:24 - each point in to find out each ordered
00:28 - pair so if I plug -2 in I get 2 * -2
00:33 - which is -4 + 1 is
00:36 - -3 I plug- 1 in I get 2 * -1 which gives
00:41 - you -2 + 1 which is 1 if you plug 0o in
00:47 - you get 2 * 0 which is 0 + 1 is
00:51 - 1 2 * 1 is 2 + 1 is
00:55 - 3 and 2 * 2 is 4 + 1 is five so now what
01:02 - we're going to do is graph each of these
01:05 - points and then connect them together to
01:07 - graph our line so -3 or -23 1 2 1 2
01:20 - 3 this is
01:23 - 0.11 negative 1 one
01:27 - one this is 2 2 0 1 Zer up
01:35 - one 1
01:37 - 3 one
01:41 - three and two
01:49 - up
01:50 - up
01:52 - five so this is our last point so if
01:57 - we connect
02:01 - all these
02:09 - points so if you connect this these
02:13 - points by drawing in this line you'll
02:17 - get the line and mine's a little bit off
02:20 - just because I didn't use actual graph
02:22 - paper but when you do these at home and
02:24 - you use graph paper your lines will be
02:28 - exact method two
02:31 - is um is how we're going to graph it
02:34 - using slope intercept
02:37 - form
02:41 - so this is the more preferred way
02:45 - because it's it's more ex it's easier
02:48 - and it requires less plugging in so
02:53 - since we know
02:56 - that our slope is equal to two
03:00 - and we know that our Y
03:03 - intercept is
03:07 - -33 is
03:09 - where our graph
03:12 - touches the Y
03:14 - AIS and at any Y intercept the x
03:18 - coordinate is zero so the that point is
03:22 - 0
03:23 - -3 so if we draw in our Y intercept and
03:27 - I'm going to name label it with a little
03:29 - y
03:31 - and starting at our Y intercept we're
03:34 - going to use the definition of slope to
03:37 - graph our line so slope is just the
03:41 - ratio of rise over run so if it has a
03:45 - slope of two that means its rise is two
03:49 - and its run is one so starting at
03:52 - 0-3 we're going to go up
03:56 - two to the right one
04:01 - up two to the right
04:04 - one up
04:05 - two to the right one and then starting
04:09 - at our same Y intercept we're going to
04:12 - go down two and left
04:16 - one and that gives you the same kind of
04:19 - slope because if you take
04:22 - negative right here if you
04:26 - take2 and put it over negative 1 you
04:29 - still will get two
04:33 - so that gives us our points and then we
04:39 - can connect
04:42 - them we're going to connect them and
04:44 - we're going to get the same line This is
04:47 - the line we just
04:50 - got and this is the line we got before
05:00 - and if you look at them
05:02 - both they're the same
05:07 - one so that's all we're going to do with
05:11 - graphing but make sure you come back and
05:13 - watch the next video we're going to we
05:15 - we're going to work on solving systems
05:17 - of equations
