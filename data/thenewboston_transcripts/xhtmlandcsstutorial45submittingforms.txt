00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 45th xhtml
00:03 - tutorial and before I start I want to
00:05 - say that today March 13 2011 Duke has
00:10 - just beaten UNC seventy five to fifty
00:13 - eight so if you're a Duke fan
00:15 - congratulations if you're a UNC fan I'm
00:17 - sorry if you're watching this video like
00:20 - two years later then this is history
00:23 - what do you care so anyways let's go
00:25 - ahead and get to the tutorial it's time
00:27 - for me to stop talking about basketball
00:28 - and let's go ahead and say we're making
00:31 - a forum right here the perfect forum and
00:35 - now it's time to add why is this so my
00:40 - screen looks like a doll for some reason
00:42 - shouldn't it be brighter if this
00:44 - tutorial looks like not as bright as the
00:47 - other ones then uh let me know because
00:49 - it looks that way to me
00:50 - but anyways let's go ahead and give them
00:52 - a place to enter their username and we
00:54 - will do this with like input and type
00:59 - equals text and name equals username and
01:05 - go ahead and put an ending - right there
01:08 - and my mom's texting with me let's see
01:10 - what she said mama
01:13 - who she's talking me about my cousin who
01:17 - is this is another thing that's going on
01:19 - right now there's an earthquake in Japan
01:21 - recently and my cousin was telling her
01:24 - about it so anyways that's what my mom
01:26 - and my cousin we're talking about now we
01:28 - can continue ok so copy and paste and
01:31 - now this one can be password and
01:33 - password is really easy just change the
01:35 - type to password and the name to pass or
01:40 - anything you want so now we have this on
01:43 - our screen right here okay save this and
01:47 - refresh it a username and password so
01:50 - say the user fills out their username
01:52 - and password but now they're done and
01:55 - now the user wants to submit their
01:57 - information into the website well how
01:59 - can we have the user submit their
02:01 - information to the website so that the
02:03 - website can you know do whatever it
02:04 - wants with it's stored in a database or
02:06 - make a user account or whatever well in
02:08 - order to have the user submit the data
02:12 - they need the last well this is the last
02:16 - input type I'm going to tell you about
02:17 - and this is called submit now whenever
02:20 - we make the type submit this appears
02:25 - whoa that's definitely not how you do it
02:27 - kind of getting ahead of myself here
02:29 - type equals submit whenever we have a
02:32 - submit button on the screen then I just
02:35 - gave it away it makes a button appear on
02:38 - the screen and what is that button say
02:39 - on it well actually you have another
02:42 - attribute here called value and whatever
02:44 - you type in the value is what appears on
02:46 - the button so now we're gonna have two
02:48 - fields a user and a password field in
02:51 - this input type submit this means make a
02:55 - submit button and what do you want the
02:57 - sound it submit with explanation point
02:59 - at the end so go ahead and save this and
03:01 - refresh and check it out we now can
03:03 - enter a username and password and they
03:06 - hit submit but now when they hit submit
03:08 - nothing happens and that is because I
03:11 - didn't tell you about this one little
03:13 - thing first of all we don't know any
03:14 - computer programming yet so I'm not even
03:16 - gonna be getting to type talk to you
03:18 - guys about that but in your opening form
03:21 - tag you need two attributes by default
03:24 - to tell you truth I can't even remember
03:26 - if I went over this before or not but I
03:28 - don't think I have so here you go
03:30 - later on when you learn how to program
03:33 - in like PHP or something you're going to
03:36 - have something called an action and your
03:38 - action is basically saying this whenever
03:41 - the user hit submits hits the submit
03:44 - button what do you want to do with all
03:46 - that data well typically you have
03:49 - another file somewhere and then this
03:52 - file is responsible for processing this
03:54 - data the file is typically a small
03:57 - computer program and say this program
03:59 - would take their username and password
04:01 - and store it in the database so the file
04:03 - might be called something like do
04:06 - something I'm just giving you guys an
04:07 - example but you would write the file
04:09 - name in right here and aside from this
04:13 - attribute you also have something called
04:15 - a method now a method has two possible
04:20 - values get GE T or post and by the way
04:23 - if you want to shut this tutorial off
04:26 - right now then go ahead because this is
04:28 - you know kind of advanced stuff they
04:30 - don't have to worry about right now but
04:31 - you're gonna have to come back to it
04:32 - sometime anyways it has two different
04:34 - types of method get' impost
04:36 - and this is basically the way your
04:38 - browser sends data to a to the action so
04:43 - get basically if you want to bookmark
04:46 - pages you know what I'm not even tell
04:49 - you this has nothing to do with XHTML or
04:52 - CSS is more like PHP so anyways just go
04:55 - ahead and put post remember post is more
04:58 - secure always use post there that's
05:00 - that's all I'm gonna cover so anyways
05:02 - that is how you make a submit button
05:04 - even though all we can do is you know
05:06 - click it right now
05:08 - and nothing happens see it says what
05:10 - page not found because it tried to go to
05:12 - do something that file and you know
05:15 - nothing happened because I didn't even
05:17 - make that file but anyways that's what
05:19 - happens that's the core basics behind
05:21 - creating a Smith pond so later when we
05:23 - learned JavaScript or PHP we can
05:26 - actually do something with this
05:28 - information but for now I'm sorry that's
05:30 - all you guys get so all you Duke fans go
05:33 - enjoy go celebrate
05:34 - all you UNC fans go cry in a corner
05:37 - and wait for next year so yeah that's it
05:41 - thank you guys for watching and I'll see
05:42 - you in the next story
