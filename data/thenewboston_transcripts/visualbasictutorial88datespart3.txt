00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from
00:02 - youtube.com/scishow on live gamer for
00:04 - the new Boston and in this tutorial
00:06 - we're going to be creating our own dates
00:09 - and changing the values of those dates
00:11 - now if you remember from the last
00:13 - tutorials when we created created a date
00:16 - object we could only get the current
00:18 - date and time now we can set our own
00:20 - date and time in our object so let's go
00:25 - ahead and we will declare another
00:27 - variable so we'll call will declare it
00:30 - change date as date so now what we can
00:34 - do is we can type current date equals
00:38 - and to put our date in we use the pound
00:43 - character and then we put our data in
00:45 - using the month/day/year format now if
00:49 - you live over in the UK you use the day
00:52 - month year but in Visual Basic you
00:55 - always need to use the American Way I
00:59 - don't know why they do this but it keeps
01:02 - you from confusing them so there's only
01:04 - one way you can do it which is month day
01:06 - and year so we'll just go ahead and do
01:09 - October 20th
01:11 - let's do the Year 2300 and we'll go
01:15 - ahead and set the we'll just leave the
01:16 - date at 12:00 a.m. so we could set the
01:19 - date if we wanted to so but instead if
01:24 - we just leave nothing there it'll
01:26 - automatically set that date so let's go
01:30 - ahead and display this date so message
01:35 - box dot show current date dot to string
01:41 - if we go ahead and run this if we click
01:45 - show date we get October 20th 2300 at
01:49 - 12:00 a.m. now we can also manipulate
01:54 - these dates to add certain values to it
01:58 - now we can add days months years seconds
02:01 - and hours and whatever we want so let's
02:04 - go ahead and set our change date to a
02:08 - change to current date change so type
02:12 - change
02:12 - date equals current date dot add and you
02:17 - can see we get ad days add hours add
02:20 - milliseconds add minutes add months
02:22 - seconds ticks and years so let's just go
02:25 - ahead and add days here so how many days
02:30 - we want to add well the value that we
02:32 - pass to this sub right here is a double
02:37 - so let's just use a number let's just
02:39 - add five days to it and then we'll type
02:44 - message box dot show and we will show
02:50 - changed date dot and let's just do to
02:55 - long date string so let's go ahead and
03:01 - run this and you can see that here's our
03:05 - form and when we click show date we get
03:08 - October twentieth 2300 click OK we get
03:11 - Thursday October 25th 2300 so let's go
03:17 - ahead and change this to two string
03:18 - instead so instead of October on instead
03:24 - of October 20th we get October 25th so
03:27 - let's just run this one more time and
03:29 - we'll look at it with the exact same
03:31 - formats so click show date October 20th
03:36 - and we add days we get October 25th now
03:40 - we can also add years so let's go ahead
03:42 - and add some years to this let's add 500
03:46 - years let's go ahead and run this show
03:51 - day we get the Year 2300 and this we
03:55 - added 500 years so we get 2800 now you
03:59 - can also use negative values inside of
04:01 - the parameters for add anything so if
04:04 - you want to add seconds or months you
04:06 - can do a negative so let's subtract 150
04:09 - or 250 years from our current date which
04:12 - should give us the value 2050 so we get
04:18 - 2300 and then 2050 so
04:23 - on go ahead and make some date objects
04:26 - and set them to certain dates that you
04:28 - want remember that you have to use the
04:31 - month day and then year format and you
04:37 - enclose this inside of pound symbols and
04:39 - then you can add years or months or
04:43 - whatever you like to the date and you
04:46 - can also use negative numbers and the
04:49 - argument for that is double so go ahead
04:51 - create some days to manipulate them make
04:53 - your own dates play with those and then
04:56 - once you are familiar with those go
04:58 - ahead and move on to the next tutorial
