00:00 - what's going on guys is Bucky and
00:01 - welcome to your third C++ tutorial and
00:04 - in this tutorial I want to go over a
00:06 - little more about printing text out on
00:08 - the screen
00:09 - now in the last tutorial you remember
00:11 - that we could use that special thing
00:13 - called C out which was technically
00:15 - called the ALPA object and the less than
00:17 - less than sign which was called the
00:19 - stream insertion operator to pronounce X
00:22 - on the screen in the way we did this is
00:24 - we added double quotes after and
00:26 - whatever we print it out in this double
00:28 - quotes like boy I love bacon whatever we
00:33 - put inside those double quotes would
00:34 - just print out on the screen so if we go
00:36 - ahead and we built and run this we saw
00:38 - boy I love bacon right on the screen
00:41 - simple enough but now what I want to go
00:44 - over is just a little more about C out
00:47 - and I just want to make sure you guys
00:49 - understand how it works
00:50 - so each function is made up of these
00:53 - things called statements and typically
00:56 - people put one statement per line of
00:58 - code and remember all statements and
01:00 - with semicolons so say we wanted to
01:02 - print out something else out on the
01:03 - screen will you to write C out less and
01:06 - less than and write something else like
01:08 - and ham just like that so you might be
01:12 - thinking alright I got a feeling I know
01:13 - this is going to do on the first line
01:15 - it's going to print out boy I love bacon
01:17 - and on the second line it's going to
01:18 - print out an ham because you know that's
01:20 - how it appears in our code so that's
01:22 - what it's going to do but if we go ahead
01:24 - and build and run this it says boy I
01:26 - love bacon and ham all on the same line
01:29 - of code every scratching your head
01:31 - saying all right why exactly does it do
01:33 - that the reason it does that B is
01:35 - because when you're using this thing
01:38 - called C out it's called printing it out
01:41 - into a stream and it pretty much takes
01:44 - all your characters and prints them out
01:46 - in the same stream so whenever this
01:48 - stream is done you're not telling it to
01:51 - move to a new line you're saying print
01:53 - out these characters and then stop right
01:56 - at the end of the sign so then this
01:58 - stream starts printing out and again
02:00 - you're not telling it anywhere to move
02:02 - to a new line computer programs are very
02:05 - picky and they need to be told exactly
02:07 - what to do so in order
02:09 - move to a new line we need to add a
02:12 - special symbol I guess you would say and
02:15 - the symbol is this first of all you need
02:17 - to add another stream insertion operator
02:19 - and you can go ahead and write E and DL
02:22 - what this means is end line and now when
02:27 - we go ahead and build and run it check
02:29 - what happens
02:29 - it runs boy I love bacon and then it
02:33 - runs in line and before your stream
02:36 - insertion operator would be right here
02:38 - but now since you set end line and go
02:40 - ahead and end this line and it moves it
02:43 - to a next line so basically all you have
02:45 - to remember is anytime you want to move
02:47 - to a new line use the character n L
02:49 - which is code word for end line now if
02:53 - we're saying alright that's easy enough
02:54 - to remember so let me go ahead and show
02:58 - you something that might be even easier
02:59 - for you inside your quotation marks if
03:03 - you go ahead and add backslash n this is
03:06 - basically the same as adding a newline
03:09 - backslash n is the code I guess that all
03:13 - is code for go to a new line so now it's
03:17 - going to say boy I love bacon and then
03:20 - it's going to come across this thing
03:21 - called backslash and it's going to say
03:22 - hold on what is this backslash n oh I
03:25 - know what it is it's the symbol to move
03:28 - to a new line so this is basically just
03:31 - an alternative way to move to new lines
03:33 - the only difference is when n L you
03:37 - needed to add another insertion operator
03:39 - and then right end L right there with a
03:41 - newline you write it inside the
03:43 - quotation marks because it gets
03:45 - interpreted in different kind of ways so
03:47 - let's go ahead and build and run this
03:48 - and just verify that yep
03:50 - boy I love bacon newline and ham so
03:55 - again like I said whenever you want to
03:57 - print text out on a new line you have to
03:59 - be very specific with C++ and tell it
04:01 - exactly what to do and you can do this
04:03 - either using the NL or the new line that
04:07 - goes inside the quotation marks so aside
04:10 - from this you might think in alright so
04:12 - I print this out and I got this on next
04:15 - line but what if I wanted a blank line
04:17 - in between these two well all you would
04:19 - have to do is write new line
04:21 - new line and then when you go ahead and
04:23 - you build and run this oak say alright
04:25 - boy I love bacon new line new line and
04:29 - then it printed out and ham simple
04:31 - enough
04:32 - pretty cool huh and I guess one other
04:34 - thing I can show you is if you go ahead
04:36 - and do see out insertion operator arm
04:40 - you can do things like this boy new line
04:44 - i new line love new line bacon new line
04:50 - so you know you're not only limited to
04:52 - you know one new line per statement you
04:55 - can have multiple new lines in a single
04:57 - statement so now it says boy I love
05:01 - bacon
05:02 - pretty cool huh so that's all the basics
05:04 - I wanted you guys for this tutorial
05:05 - again I wanted to stress how to print
05:08 - out text on the screen and also the
05:11 - stream insertion operator it's basically
05:14 - this each stream insertion resumes it's
05:19 - printing out wherever the previous ones
05:21 - stopped so if you want to move it to a
05:23 - new line you need to use one of these
05:25 - new line symbols either NL or new line
05:28 - so that's all I have for you guys in the
05:29 - soil now you should be a pro at printing
05:32 - texts out on the screen so you know
05:34 - we're not ready to bundle up this
05:36 - program and sell it to Microsoft yet but
05:38 - hey let's start so thank you guys for
05:39 - watching if you have any questions go to
05:41 - my website the new boston comm and ask
05:43 - me on my forum so thank you guys for
05:46 - watching and I uh I guess I'll see you
05:48 - next video
