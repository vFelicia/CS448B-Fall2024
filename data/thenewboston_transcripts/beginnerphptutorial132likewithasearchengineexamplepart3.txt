00:00 - so let's go ahead and say if is set
00:04 - dollar underscore post remember we're
00:07 - using post data down here and we're
00:09 - going to say search name so we're
00:11 - corresponding this to the name that
00:13 - we've given the element in our HTML
00:15 - document so if this is true we're going
00:18 - to run this block and inside this block
00:20 - we're going to set a variable called
00:24 - search underscore name to the value of
00:28 - what's been posted because otherwise if
00:30 - we specify this outside of our if
00:32 - statement before we've checked if the
00:33 - form has been submitted we're going to
00:35 - have an undefined index error or an
00:37 - undefined variable error so we've put
00:41 - this into a variable so we can use this
00:43 - later on in our code and we don't have
00:45 - to keep referencing back to this now
00:47 - let's check if this isn't empty so if
00:49 - not empty and we're specifying the
00:54 - search name in here if it's not empty
00:58 - then do something else so basically
01:01 - what's going to happen is let's just
01:02 - echo out and okay message there let's
01:06 - come back to our code let's type in
01:08 - nothing so we click nothing or click
01:10 - Submit without anything in being and
01:12 - then nothing happens if we type a value
01:14 - and click sub search we get an OK
01:16 - message back there so now we need to
01:18 - start constructing our query so I'm
01:20 - going to create a new variable called
01:21 - query and this is going to equal our SQL
01:24 - query that we're going to execute or run
01:26 - inside of our database so we're going to
01:29 - say select and we're saying select name
01:31 - from remember our date our tables called
01:34 - names we've already connected to our
01:36 - we're already connected our database a
01:39 - database here remember these values must
01:41 - correspond to your your login
01:43 - credentials and also the database that
01:45 - you're using and let's take a look here
01:47 - so we've got the names as the database
01:50 - so we're selecting the name from names
01:53 - so select name from names
01:56 - we're name like and now we can do what
02:02 - we've been doing inside our SQL tab in
02:04 - PHP myadmin
02:05 - and we can look at the most sensible
02:09 - search option in this case would be to
02:11 - have a wildcard either side
02:13 - so you can put such name in here now
02:15 - remember we need to think about security
02:17 - for this so that's that's a pendous on
02:22 - let's get that outside of here so what
02:24 - we've done is we've just closed our our
02:27 - core our string data here and appended
02:30 - on the search name and then appended on
02:31 - the rest of our string data
02:33 - let's enclose this in MySQL real escape
02:36 - string to ensure that SQL injection
02:40 - can't take place in this instance and
02:42 - we're just as protecting against it as
02:45 - much as we can for now so now what we
02:47 - want to do is we want to run the query
02:48 - so query run is equal to MySQL query and
02:52 - query so now that we've run the query we
02:56 - should have returned a value based on
02:58 - what the user has actually typed in so
03:00 - say the user typed in Alex we'd search
03:02 - for a wild-card either side of Alex and
03:04 - it could return whether it will return
03:07 - Alex Garrett and Alex Malcolm so let's
03:11 - go ahead and check how many results we
03:13 - have got back so what we can do is we
03:15 - can say if MySQL num rows and the we're
03:21 - going to feed this in the query so this
03:23 - function is basically counting the
03:25 - amount of rows that we return bit by
03:27 - this query so if it if they're greater
03:29 - than or equal to one then do something
03:33 - so we want to say you know display the
03:36 - results otherwise this means that no
03:39 - results have been found so we can just
03:41 - echo no results found up here for now
03:45 - we're just going to we're just going to
03:47 - write echo found we're not going to
03:50 - display the data now but we're just
03:51 - going to test that our queries actually
03:53 - working so let's go ahead and type in a
03:55 - name that's not in this database so we
03:57 - could type Craig in for example click
03:59 - search no results results found if we
04:02 - type Alex and click search found so if
04:05 - we know that our query works now because
04:06 - we have data inside of our database that
04:09 - would correspond to Alex with the
04:10 - wild-card either side let's go ahead and
04:12 - type in Garrett click search now let's
04:16 - go ahead and type in G arr
04:18 - and click search that's found now let's
04:20 - go ahead and type in
04:22 - for example Josh click search and Noah's
04:26 - axe found so we know that our query is
04:27 - working now what we can do is work to
04:29 - show this data so we're going to use a
04:31 - while loop this is going to loop through
04:33 - all the records that have been found and
04:35 - put them into an associative array and -
04:38 - o sitive array i mean an array with a
04:40 - field name as the key so we're
04:42 - referencing each returned row by the key
04:46 - itself so the data we want to receive
04:48 - from this so I'm going to say query row
04:51 - equals mysql fetch associative array
04:57 - this stands for associative anyway and
04:59 - we've put in the query that we've
05:01 - already run inside here
