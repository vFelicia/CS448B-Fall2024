00:00 - alrighty guys welcome back and in this
00:03 - video we're gonna be learning how to
00:04 - remove
00:05 - and also inspect containers sounds
00:08 - pretty exciting i know i know
00:10 - so let's go ahead and just view all the
00:13 - containers that we have
00:14 - so far so i'm gonna do docker container
00:17 - lsa
00:18 - and okay i mean a lot of these we just
00:22 - we just don't need anymore it's in fact
00:24 - kind of embarrassing how many containers
00:26 - i have on my computer right now so i
00:27 - want to start getting rid of some of
00:29 - them
00:30 - so this one ping google.com definitely
00:32 - not going to be using
00:33 - this again so let's figure out how to
00:35 - remove it now the first thing i'm going
00:37 - to want to do is copy this container id
00:40 - right there and a very simple command to
00:43 - remove any container you can do
00:45 - docker container rm and then you can
00:48 - paste in the container id
00:51 - all right it looks like it was removed
00:53 - now just to confirm
00:55 - yes all of them are still there instead
00:58 - of this individual one
00:59 - cb71 which was just removed
01:03 - now another thing that i want to point
01:05 - out and
01:06 - it's probably not going to happen in
01:07 - this example but
01:09 - removing a container is sometimes going
01:11 - to fail
01:12 - and this happens whenever you have some
01:14 - processes that are running inside your
01:16 - container
01:16 - remember that weird edge case that we
01:18 - saw last time either way
01:20 - the point i'm trying to make is if you
01:22 - ever need to force
01:24 - removal of a container and
01:27 - let's say docker container rm
01:30 - and then the container id itself and by
01:33 - the way this is this container id i'm
01:34 - using for this little example
01:36 - if this command ever bugs out and fails
01:39 - and you need to force removal
01:40 - right after this rm you can do dash f
01:44 - and this is just gonna force removal so
01:46 - again if you ever get any errors
01:48 - then you can force it and it'll clean it
01:50 - up remove it from your computer
01:53 - nice little tip now another cool command
01:55 - is
01:56 - inspect now the inspectmen allows you to
01:59 - view more
02:00 - detailed information and i mean a lot of
02:02 - information
02:03 - about a container a lot more that's just
02:05 - on one of these lines
02:07 - now to demonstrate that let me just grab
02:09 - any random container id
02:11 - and that is docker container inspect
02:15 - and then you can just paste in the
02:17 - container id now what this is going to
02:19 - return
02:19 - is actually a list and it this is
02:22 - formatted json
02:24 - so lots of information about your
02:26 - container not only the id
02:28 - the creation date the image yada yada
02:32 - you guys can um
02:33 - go through this if you want and see all
02:34 - of the different fields
02:36 - but just want to show you guys what
02:37 - inspect does it returns json so
02:40 - this might be useful if you're let's say
02:43 - creating a digital currency network and
02:46 - you need to simulate an entire
02:47 - peer-to-peer network on your own
02:49 - computer and you want to view
02:50 - information about each node but like
02:52 - who would do that that's just a crazy
02:54 - example no one's going to make this
02:55 - entire digital currency network
02:58 - now last but not least and i know i
03:00 - mentioned this in a previous video but i
03:02 - just want to reiterate
03:04 - since i have a feeling it's going to be
03:05 - a pretty common command especially if
03:07 - you're just getting started learning
03:09 - docker
03:09 - that is how to delete all containers
03:12 - from your system
03:13 - and that is docker system
03:16 - prune and if you do hyphen hyphen
03:19 - all this is going to wipe everything
03:22 - including the cache
03:23 - so you can run this and just verify yes
03:27 - and another thing to note is whenever
03:29 - you run this
03:30 - it is going to have to redownload from
03:32 - docker hub any containers that you had
03:34 - before
03:35 - so that's fine cleaned up some space and
03:38 - now just to verify if i list out all my
03:40 - current containers i have nothing a nice
03:43 - clean system so i thought i was gonna
03:47 - have time to talk about exec
03:49 - in this video but there's a lot to that
03:51 - so i'll actually break it up into the
03:52 - next video
03:53 - but for now thank you guys for watching
03:55 - and i will see you next time
