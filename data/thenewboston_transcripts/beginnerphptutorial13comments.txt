00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston now in this tutorial we're we're
00:08 - going to be covering uh comments inside
00:10 - PHP now if you've programmed before in
00:12 - any other language you'll understand how
00:15 - important commenting your code is uh
00:17 - this could be in large chunks or
00:19 - commenting single lines just to show
00:22 - yourself and other programmers what the
00:24 - program does um and maybe just add notes
00:27 - for copyright reasons or anything else
00:30 - now I've created this extremely simple
00:32 - and basic um PHP script which basically
00:36 - just outputs hello world to the browser
00:39 - now obviously us looking at this we know
00:42 - exactly what it does but for the purpose
00:44 - of of this tutorial I'm going to be
00:46 - commenting it just to let anyone else
00:48 - that's looking at it understand um
00:51 - what's going on so the first type of
00:53 - commenting is uh just single line
00:55 - commenting
00:57 - um so what I've done is I've pull this
01:00 - down a bit and what I'm going to do is
01:01 - I'm going to do two forward slashes now
01:04 - you can see that as I type text my text
01:07 - editors Chang this to italics and it's
01:10 - turned gray now this is a just a
01:13 - standard notation for my Text Editor to
01:15 - show me a comment uh this just makes
01:17 - sure it doesn't interfere with the
01:18 - readability of the code um so you'll
01:20 - probably find that you whatever text
01:21 - editor you're doing that um unless
01:23 - you're using something uh basic like
01:25 - notepad it's not going to show you but
01:27 - in this case it does so I'm going to
01:29 - comment
01:31 - uses
01:32 - Echo language construct to Output the
01:39 - text hello world to the browser so
01:44 - that's a simple comment that shows uh
01:47 - anyone that's watching this what this
01:49 - does now what we can also do is we can
01:52 - add comments directly after lines uh as
01:55 - long as they're not obviously before uh
01:57 - anything important like this code so for
01:59 - example if if I was to put two forward
02:01 - slashes this is automatically now
02:03 - commented out and that line of code
02:05 - won't run um but this is also useful if
02:08 - you were to run through a program and
02:10 - you're debugging it you could just
02:11 - quickly put some uh forward slashes and
02:14 - uh test different parts of your code uh
02:16 - and remove parts of your code that you
02:17 - didn't want to run now let's say I want
02:20 - to add up here um a little bit of
02:22 - information about this page who it's
02:23 - created by and the date so um I want to
02:27 - create a long um a long a long sort of
02:31 - paragraph or short paragraph in this
02:33 - case of just text uh explaining about
02:35 - the program now to do this I'm going to
02:37 - use a forward slash and then an asterisk
02:40 - I'm going to come down a few lines and
02:41 - I'm going to type another asterisk and
02:43 - then another forward slash now you could
02:45 - see then just while I was typing that uh
02:48 - this text down here was going gray um um
02:52 - now that I've ended that everything
02:54 - inside here is going to be regarded as a
02:56 - comment so you can see this is a lot
02:59 - easier than do
03:01 - doing this for several lines CU you may
03:03 - want several lines um to write on each
03:06 - line uh but obviously the easier way
03:08 - would be to use this notation so now
03:11 - what we can do is we can write uh some
03:14 - information um inside here so we could
03:18 - just pop the date in um and that's uh
03:21 - just a lot better way and it looks
03:23 - neater as well um obviously you could
03:26 - bring say this up here if you really
03:28 - wanted to uh it's entirely up to you but
03:31 - anything between this and this is going
03:33 - to be regarded as a comment system and
03:35 - these are oneline comment systems or
03:37 - comments which can be placed either
03:39 - above below or after um a line um but
03:45 - obviously not before cuz that's going to
03:47 - uh render your code
03:49 - um unreadable by PHP so that's
03:52 - commenting uh in PHP
