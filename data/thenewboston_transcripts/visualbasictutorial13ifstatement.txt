00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in
00:07 - this tutorial we're going to be learning
00:08 - the if statement now the if statement is
00:11 - one of the most useful tools for
00:14 - beginners in Visual Basic because
00:16 - there's so much that you can do with it
00:18 - and it's very easy to pick up it's very
00:20 - intuitive so let's go ahead and get
00:22 - started now first off we are going to
00:25 - make a program that will ask a user for
00:28 - their username and password now this may
00:30 - be a little bit different than what
00:31 - you'd expect for a username and password
00:34 - login to be but um it will give you the
00:36 - concept of the if statement and then
00:38 - you'll be able to go make some programs
00:40 - using the if statement and get used to
00:42 - it so that you can move on to the next
00:44 - tutorials so let's go ahead and get
00:46 - started we'll do
00:48 - console. right
00:53 - line what is your
00:56 - name so now what we're going to do is
00:59 - we're going to declare string so we'll
01:01 - use the dim keyword to let uh Visual
01:03 - Basic know that we're going to make a
01:04 - variable so we'll dim user
01:08 - name as string and we'll set it equal to
01:14 - console.readline
01:16 - so now what we're going to do is we're
01:19 - going to
01:19 - do
01:21 - console. rightline and we're just going
01:24 - to ask them for their password so what
01:27 - is your password
01:33 - and then we'll declare another variable
01:35 - and it'll be password so
01:38 - dim
01:39 - password as a string and we're going to
01:42 - set equal to console
01:45 - dot read line so we're just getting
01:48 - whatever the user typed in so now we're
01:51 - going to create our if statement so to
01:54 - start off an if statement you're just
01:56 - going to use the keyword if and when you
01:58 - type that in it's going to highlight it
01:59 - blue
02:00 - and it's going to show it up in
02:01 - intellisense now
02:04 - the um the definition for the if
02:06 - statement in this is
02:09 - conditionally conditionally executes a
02:11 - group of statements depending on the
02:12 - value of an expression so basically what
02:15 - that says is if a certain uh condition
02:18 - is true then go ahead and do whatever is
02:20 - inside this if statement so if username
02:26 - equals
02:28 - Sam then what do we want it to do and if
02:31 - you press enter you can see that it'll
02:32 - automatically add end if for you now all
02:35 - if statements have to end with an end if
02:38 - or else you'll get a syntax
02:40 - error so I'll do if username equals Sam
02:44 - then console do right
02:49 - line welcome
02:54 - Sam and now we're just going to create a
02:57 - second if statement so if
03:00 - password
03:02 - equals the New
03:04 - Boston then what what do we want it to
03:07 - do we will just type console
03:11 - do right
03:13 - line and inside of there we'll
03:17 - type you have entered the correct
03:27 - password okay so now if we run this
03:29 - you're going to see we have a little bit
03:31 - of a problem here so if we type what is
03:33 - your name and I type Sam what is your
03:35 - password the New Boston you can see
03:38 - It'll close out right after we're done
03:40 - with that so we're just going to add a
03:42 - read line right here so console.
03:47 - readline and so this should pause the
03:49 - program and let us see what we have done
03:53 - so what is your name Sam and what is
03:56 - your password the New
03:58 - Boston so because name is equal to Sam
04:02 - then it's going to print out welcome Sam
04:04 - and because the New Boston the password
04:07 - that we have typed in is equal to the
04:09 - New Boston in our code right here it's
04:11 - going to say you have entered the
04:13 - correct
04:14 - password so let's go ahead and let's
04:18 - separate this a bit here just to make
04:20 - the a it a little bit more
04:23 - readable so we'll just uh write another
04:26 - line which will just give us a blank
04:27 - line and separate these so so now if we
04:30 - run this again it'll say what is your
04:31 - name and if I type let's say Gerald and
04:34 - it'll say what is your password I type
04:36 - the New Boston it's going to say you
04:38 - have entered the correct password but it
04:40 - didn't say welcome Sam because Gerald is
04:43 - not equal to
04:44 - Sam so username whatever they have typed
04:48 - in is Gerald and it's not equal to Sam
04:51 - so it will not do the code inside of
04:53 - here and since we typed in the New
04:56 - Boston as our password it's going to
04:58 - tell us that we have enter the correct
05:01 - password and this will also work the
05:03 - other way around so if we do what is
05:05 - your name Sam and say what is your
05:08 - password I'll just say on live gamer
05:12 - it'll just say welcome Sam but it won't
05:14 - tell us that we have entered the correct
05:17 - password so here is uh a basic example
05:21 - of an if statement uh they're very fun
05:23 - to use when you're first beginning
05:25 - programming you can do a lot with them a
05:26 - lot more than you think you could and uh
05:29 - so go ahead uh look at this code over
05:31 - again uh go ahead and use some if
05:33 - statements and make some programs
05:35 - yourself and once you've got if
05:36 - statements nailed down uh go ahead and
05:39 - move on to the next tutorial
