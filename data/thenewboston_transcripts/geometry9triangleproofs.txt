00:00 - so today we're just gonna work some more
00:03 - with proofs and expanding what we are
00:06 - able to prove so our first proof we're
00:09 - going to do is a triangle inequality
00:11 - proof so given that the measure of angle
00:14 - abd abd right here is greater than the
00:22 - measure of angle DBC so this is greater
00:29 - than this proved that ad is greater than
00:34 - B D ok so first we're going to write
00:39 - down our given information
00:52 - and then is given to us okay so what
00:58 - we're trying to do is get this to be
01:05 - greater than this so you want to think
01:09 - back a little bit and remember the deal
01:13 - with triangle inequality if we can prove
01:16 - that the measure that the measure of the
01:19 - angle opposite this so this angle right
01:25 - here is greater than the angle opposite
01:28 - this then this the first side is greater
01:32 - than the second side so that's what
01:35 - we're going to try and do so our next
01:38 - step we're going to we can say that DBC
01:43 - so this little the smaller angle right
01:47 - here is greater than D a B which is
01:51 - right here or sorry not da yeah DC DBC
02:02 - is greater than this angle right here
02:04 - because if you remember that property
02:07 - that says this angle is equal to the sum
02:11 - of this angle in this angle well there's
02:14 - another little theorem that says the
02:24 - exterior angles are greater than either
02:34 - remote interior angle which is these
02:41 - which are these two angles right here so
02:45 - then we can say look see how this
02:53 - is greater than this and this is greater
03:03 - than this well if the measure of angle
03:06 - abd is greater than the measure of DBC
03:10 - doesn't that mean it's also greater than
03:13 - da be because it's greater than D bc
03:18 - which is greater than da be so we're
03:20 - going to use our transitive property to
03:26 - say that the measure of angle abd is
03:29 - greater than the measure of angle D a B
03:34 - and all we're doing is we're sliding
03:36 - this onto the end is greater than that
03:40 - which is greater than that and that's
03:45 - transitive property where if a equals B
03:55 - & B equals C a equals C okay now we have
04:04 - one last step so remember how I said
04:07 - that the bigger side is opposite the
04:11 - bigger angle well since we know that
04:14 - this angle right here is bigger than da
04:18 - b that means that the angle the side
04:22 - opposite b which is a d is greater than
04:25 - the side opposite a which is DB so
04:29 - therefore ad is greater than B D if a
04:38 - triangle in touch to in a triangle if
04:42 - two angles are not congruent not
04:48 - congruent then
04:51 - the bigger side lies across the bigger
05:01 - angle and we're done you always want
05:06 - your last statement to match the prove
05:10 - statement you're given in the problem
05:13 - okay given B 0 is congruent given bo is
05:25 - congruent to H n and O H is congruent to
05:30 - n BN prove that this angle o is
05:38 - congruent to this angle n okay so we're
05:44 - going to render give in pairs be hos
05:47 - congruent to h + + o H congruent to be
05:53 - and given okay now if we want to be able
06:00 - to say that this is congruent there's
06:03 - something we can do if we prove that the
06:06 - triangles are congruent first we can
06:10 - then say that their corresponding parts
06:12 - are congruent so so far we have one
06:15 - angle or one side is equal to one side
06:19 - two sides is equal to two sides and then
06:22 - they share this side right here be h so
06:28 - we can say that B H is congruent to be H
06:34 - reflexive property
06:40 - and then we can say that these triangle
06:47 - can these triangles are congruent by
06:50 - side-side-side because we have three
06:55 - pairs of congruent sides so triangle be
07:00 - 0 H is congruent to triangle h + b by
07:12 - side-side-side and then we can say that
07:18 - angle is congruent to angle and because
07:22 - you remember when we have congruent
07:25 - triangles their corresponding parts are
07:28 - also congruent so if two congruent
07:34 - triangles corresponding parts are also
07:45 - congruent and that's all we have to do
07:48 - for that one so that's all we're going
07:51 - to do with proofs today but um in our
07:56 - next lesson we're going to do some some
07:59 - new kind of proofs
