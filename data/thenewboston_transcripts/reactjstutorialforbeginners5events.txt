00:00 - all righty hoses in this video I want to
00:03 - start talking to you guys about events
00:05 - now right now our components are really
00:08 - boring to be quite honest because they
00:10 - can only do one thing and that is render
00:12 - some HTML out to the user display some
00:15 - HTML on the page pretty bland if you ask
00:18 - me now we started learning react because
00:22 - we thought that we were going to be able
00:23 - to create these cool Dynamic changing
00:26 - components that the user can interact
00:28 - with well if you ever want to do that
00:31 - then you need to learn how to use events
00:33 - so an event is just something that your
00:36 - component can do well right now it can
00:38 - render stuff out on the screen but let's
00:40 - make it do something else so above your
00:42 - render function I'm just going to make a
00:45 - simple function called do something
00:48 - because all this is going to do is let's
00:50 - say that instead of just displaying
00:53 - stuff on the screen let's have a link in
00:55 - these components as well and whenever
00:58 - you click it it'll just alert like this
01:00 - little blob of text or it'll just do
01:02 - something really basic so write do
01:05 - something or whatever you're going to
01:06 - name your
01:08 - function and then after that write
01:11 - function and then make sure you have a
01:13 - comma because you want to make sure to
01:15 - separate this
01:17 - function from this function and inside
01:20 - here you can write uh anything you want
01:22 - to do so what do we want our component
01:24 - to do well we're just going to make it
01:26 - alert something out on the screen and
01:31 - we'll just make it alert this text right
01:33 - here so let me just steal it from down
01:34 - here hit copy
01:37 - and let me write like
01:40 - uh uh
01:43 - the text displaying
01:48 - is this text right there so we can
01:51 - actually delete this since we don't want
01:54 - to display it twice so now our component
01:57 - is going to render this this is what
01:59 - it's going to display and whenever we
02:01 - call this do something function it's
02:04 - going to display this alert but now we
02:06 - actually have to make a link because
02:09 - we're going to say whenever they click
02:11 - this link that's when we want to call
02:12 - this function so I'm just going to write
02:15 - a and let me just write the text in here
02:18 - first so the link in this component will
02:20 - just say like click me something like
02:24 - that and now on click
02:30 - on click what we can say is this instead
02:35 - of a property that we're going to stick
02:36 - in this curly brace we're going to say
02:39 - this components do something and I'm too
02:43 - lazy to type it so I'm just going to
02:44 - copy
02:45 - it so whenever we click this link called
02:48 - the do something
02:51 - function and just so make sure it
02:53 - doesn't link to anything I'm just going
02:55 - to make a dead link and there we go so
02:57 - now whenever we display this component
03:00 - it's going to display the heading just
03:01 - like before and it's also going to
03:03 - display a link that says click me so
03:05 - let's check it
03:07 - out so here's the heading of each
03:09 - component and whenever I click it it's
03:11 - going to call do something which just
03:14 - pops up some text on the
03:16 - screen so here is the child element or
03:19 - definition for Bucky and here it is for
03:22 - Emily so that's the basics of events
03:25 - basically our components they aren't
03:27 - just Bland HTML that we're going display
03:30 - to the user they can also have some
03:32 - functionality so in this example we saw
03:35 - some really simple function in other
03:37 - words they displayed some alert box but
03:40 - later on our events are going to get you
03:42 - know more useful and a lot more fun so
03:45 - for now thank you guys for watching see
03:47 - you guys next video
