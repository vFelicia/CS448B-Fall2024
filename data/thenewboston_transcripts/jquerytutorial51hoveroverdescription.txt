00:00 - so we can go ahead and again use a
00:02 - selector for hover div and we want to
00:05 - say dot show first of all we want to
00:08 - show this this div or in fact first we
00:10 - want to set the text for this div so by
00:13 - using text we're placing text in between
00:15 - here and then therefore that's going to
00:18 - display correctly so the text is
00:20 - obviously hover text because we've
00:22 - already gained this unique attribute
00:24 - that we've given it then we want to go
00:27 - ahead and shove it and what this will do
00:29 - is it will just modify this display
00:30 - property to actually display it so what
00:36 - we're doing is onmouseover we're
00:38 - grabbing the hover text attribute which
00:39 - we gave in inside the link here then
00:44 - what we go ahead to do is let's just
00:45 - bring this down is set the text inside
00:48 - of our hover div and then show it and
00:50 - then bind or change the CSS properties
00:53 - of the hover div to the current mouse
00:56 - position so in essence it's quite a
00:59 - simple idea and quite easy to produce
01:04 - something like this however we are going
01:06 - to have a few problems and we're going
01:08 - to take a look at them just now so now
01:10 - you can see that when I hover over I
01:12 - have this box display now the first
01:16 - problem you notice is this is a bit
01:18 - jumpy and the reason for this is let's
01:21 - go ahead and refresh again so I'm gonna
01:23 - hover over from this side and it works
01:25 - up into a point where I have to move my
01:27 - mouse back again and now you can see
01:30 - that you know it's we just have we just
01:33 - have our text on on what we just have
01:35 - our cursor on this div so it really at
01:39 - the moment is useless because the user
01:41 - is gonna be fiddling around with this
01:42 - and it doesn't look very nice and it
01:44 - doesn't work very well so we need to
01:46 - make a couple of small adjustments to
01:49 - allow us to work properly and what we're
01:52 - gonna do is we're gonna add a value of
01:54 - 10 onto the current Y position so this
01:58 - will actually move the div 10 pixels in
02:02 - the in the in the top downwards and the
02:06 - left across so now that I've made this
02:08 - small change by just adding 10 on to
02:10 - each of these properties now in a hover
02:13 - over
02:14 - you can see that the it doesn't affect
02:16 - it it doesn't the mouse is you know it's
02:19 - the mouse is over this but it's not
02:21 - affecting it when I pull it back but we
02:24 - also have this problem as when we leave
02:26 - the element the div isn't isn't hidden
02:29 - remember we automatically have this
02:32 - hidden but we don't have an event to
02:34 - handle when the mouse comes off of the
02:36 - element to actually hide it so we want
02:40 - to go ahead and actually hide this now
02:42 - so what we can do is onto the end of our
02:45 - selector for our hover class remember
02:48 - this starts here and ends with this
02:50 - bracket just here we can go ahead and
02:53 - assign another event handler onto this
02:56 - and that is Mouse out
02:58 - so inside Mouse out we want to do
03:00 - exactly the same thing as we do and
03:02 - create a function and just bring this
03:04 - down however the only thing we need to
03:06 - write inside of here is to hide the
03:08 - hover div so hovered if we use the
03:12 - selector to select the hover div and we
03:14 - just say hide so now what's going to
03:17 - happen is when the mouse goes over this
03:19 - element we perform what we've already
03:21 - seen to be working and when it comes
03:23 - away we just hide the div now if the
03:26 - mouse was to go back onto the map and on
03:28 - to this element it would just repeat the
03:30 - process so it's almost like a cycle so
03:34 - now what's going to happen is we have
03:35 - our working element however when we pull
03:37 - away it disappears so it doesn't you
03:41 - know remain on the page so now we have
03:43 - the effect that we've been looking for
03:45 - as we hover over the div isn't
03:48 - interfering with the cursor and when we
03:50 - move away the div element disappears
03:53 - again so this is all well and good but
03:56 - we want to know that we can go ahead and
03:58 - use it on any other element so I'm just
04:01 - gonna go ahead and wrap this link in
04:02 - paragraph tags and I'm gonna come down
04:05 - and I'm going to create a new paragraph
04:07 - with an image inside of it
04:10 - so this is essentially the steps that we
04:12 - would go through if we wanted to apply
04:14 - this effect to another element now we've
04:17 - got our hover class div up there there's
04:19 - no need to duplicate this for any reason
04:22 - because it's dynamic it'll change
04:24 - depending on which element so the image
04:27 - source is Tartan jpg that's an image
04:30 - just inside my my root directory notice
04:33 - this still obviously works and we want
04:36 - to apply the same effect to this image
04:39 - so we want to apply the hover class to
04:42 - this image so hover and then we also
04:45 - want to apply this hover text attribute
04:48 - that we created and explained earlier so
04:51 - I'm gonna say a lovely Tartan image or
04:56 - pattern so now that we've done this
04:59 - we've just simply created an image and
05:01 - the only two things we've done is
05:03 - applied this class to it which is picked
05:05 - up here and we've then gone and applied
05:08 - this hover text which is picked up here
05:11 - remember using this so we're using a
05:13 - unique attribute for the particular for
05:17 - a particular element so let's go ahead
05:19 - and preview this our our link works us
05:24 - as it would now when we hover over our
05:26 - image we have the same effect with
05:28 - different text now let me just explain
05:31 - quickly the process that again if you're
05:34 - not too sure in this the process that
05:35 - this goes through so now that we've
05:37 - hovered over we've shown the div we've
05:40 - assigned it to the particular cursor
05:42 - which will always happen because jQuery
05:43 - handles this event for us and we've
05:46 - applied the text Google a powerful
05:48 - search engine to the div on our page
05:50 - here now when we hover away that
05:55 - particular div is hidden then now the
05:57 - text will still remain assigned to that
06:00 - div however when we hover over the image
06:02 - we assign the new description to that
06:05 - div and then we show that div as well as
06:08 - well as you know repeating the process
06:10 - for assigning it to the coordinates arm
06:13 - out there I'm at our mouse are at is at
06:16 - so we're essentially done if like I said
06:21 - at the start of the tutorial if you
06:22 - wanted to go ahead and apply this to
06:24 - your own website all you would have to
06:26 - do is go ahead and include this Java Tex
06:29 - Jas file on any page that you'd want to
06:32 - use it or in a global JavaScript file
06:34 - that you might be using for your website
06:35 - obviously you need the use of jQuery and
06:39 - all you need to a place on your page is
06:41 - this div element here but then again you
06:44 - could go ahead and probably include it
06:45 - on another page or something so that was
06:49 - an extremely simple way of creating a
06:52 - hover over description using jQuery but
06:56 - we've tailored it to make sure that it
06:57 - works properly and looks okay and most
07:00 - importantly we've made it so we can use
07:02 - it with lots of different elements
