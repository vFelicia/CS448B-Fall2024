00:00 - already I'll welcome back and in this
00:02 - video we are going to be setting up a
00:04 - domain name for our front end
00:07 - because remember in the last well not
00:09 - the last video but a few tutorials ago
00:11 - what we did is we deployed our front end
00:13 - and we pretty much saw how to host the
00:16 - website from S3 and set up our CDN as
00:19 - well however with that we just got this
00:22 - long honkintalking Cloud for a kind of
00:25 - default domain name and in this video
00:28 - like I said we're going to be figuring
00:29 - out how to use our own domain name so
00:31 - the users don't get carpal tunnel trying
00:33 - to type this thing in each time
00:35 - so anyways go ahead and head over to the
00:38 - cloud front distribution that you set up
00:41 - and you can just go ahead and click into
00:43 - it and on just the general tab you're
00:47 - going to see this little section right
00:48 - here which is your domain name and just
00:51 - go ahead and click this icon to copy
00:52 - that
00:53 - and from here we're going to head over
00:55 - to Route 53
00:57 - and hopefully you already got a um you
01:00 - already like bought a domain name in
01:02 - uh of course you're going to need the
01:04 - domain name to actually set it up I am
01:07 - going to be using this one right here
01:09 - vitaxia.io
01:11 - now
01:12 - what you are probably going to see let
01:15 - me minimize that is you may have in a
01:18 - record already so if you don't you're
01:21 - just going to need to create one but if
01:22 - you do go ahead and select that and
01:25 - we're going to edit it right here now
01:28 - typically these a records uh they point
01:32 - to an IP and this could either be a ec2
01:36 - instance or an elastic IP but what we
01:39 - are going to want to do is kind of
01:41 - change this default configuration
01:43 - where instead of this we are going to
01:46 - use an alias and what we want to do is
01:49 - we want to I'll show you this route
01:51 - traffic 2 and for the endpoint we want
01:54 - to choose an alias to a cloudfront
01:56 - distribution
01:57 - and then for the distribution we're just
02:00 - going to go ahead and paste in what we
02:02 - have now another thing that I want to
02:04 - know is that remember when I said click
02:06 - that copy icon and we're going to use
02:09 - that value right here whenever you copy
02:11 - this it included this https colon
02:14 - forwards S4 slash but whenever you paste
02:17 - it in here make sure not to include that
02:19 - part so it's pretty much going to be
02:21 - that value that you copied without that
02:24 - and then once that is all good to go
02:26 - just go ahead and hit save
02:29 - so now
02:31 - your a record should look like this
02:34 - so the taxi i o pointing to our
02:37 - cloudfront distribution without that
02:39 - https
02:41 - so now this is all good go for the time
02:43 - being now hop back into that cloudfront
02:47 - distribution
02:48 - and then from here go ahead and click
02:50 - edit
02:51 - and what we want to do is look for this
02:54 - section alternate domain name cname and
02:57 - we pretty much just need to link it up
02:59 - to the domain name that we got
03:02 - so that is vitaxia
03:04 - dot IO
03:07 - now what we also need to do is we're
03:11 - gonna need to set up a certificate so we
03:14 - can serve our site over https
03:17 - so from here I'm going to go ahead and
03:20 - hit request certificate
03:22 - and then yes it is a public certificate
03:26 - go ahead and hit the next and for this
03:29 - fully qualified domain name
03:32 - butaxia.io
03:34 - and for this validation method make sure
03:36 - that you choose DNS validation I'm going
03:39 - to show you how easy it is to set up
03:41 - pretty much AWS has built-in tools to
03:43 - take care of all this it's going to be a
03:45 - piece of cake
03:46 - and all of this is good by default can
03:48 - just go ahead and hit request right here
03:52 - and now let me close out all these
03:54 - prompts taking off like half my screen
03:56 - here alright so in a little bit you can
03:59 - see you may have to refresh it as well
04:01 - but you should see that this is set up
04:04 - pending validation and what this pending
04:07 - validation means is that yes you
04:08 - requested a certificate but we aren't
04:11 - sure that you actually own that domain
04:14 - name yet now in order to kind of prove
04:18 - that we do we need to set up something
04:21 - with our DNS configuration however like
04:23 - I said AWS is going to take care of this
04:26 - so let me show you how to do it right
04:27 - now
04:28 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
04:30 - click into this and then what I'm going
04:33 - to do from here is I'm going to hit
04:35 - create records in Route 53 and actually
04:38 - let me show you kind of what's going on
04:41 - behind the scenes so in a new tab again
04:45 - I didn't close out of this one but I
04:47 - want to show you in a Route 53
04:50 - if I go back into vitaxia.io you see
04:53 - that I have three records right here in
04:55 - a and NS in in SOA well whenever
05:00 - I hit this button right here which is
05:03 - create record in Route 53 I just need to
05:06 - verify this hit create record then what
05:10 - it's going to do and I probably have to
05:11 - refresh this
05:13 - is you see we now have a new record
05:15 - right here and this is pretty much
05:19 - um kind of to this like certificate
05:21 - management process how we can prove that
05:23 - we own this domain name and it pretty
05:27 - much does this by saying that if I was
05:29 - able to create this record and modify
05:32 - this domain name in this kind of way
05:33 - then of course it acts as proof because
05:36 - you know I have access to this domain
05:37 - name so anyways that's kind of the
05:40 - process behind the scenes and I just
05:41 - thought it was uh cool to let you know
05:43 - that but anyways that's really all we
05:46 - have to do for this and just to make
05:49 - sure this is all good I want to refresh
05:52 - this
05:53 - and all right so I paused the video and
05:56 - came back because it did take like a
05:57 - minute and I I don't know just didn't
06:00 - think it was a very entertaining just to
06:02 - watch me refresh this for another minute
06:04 - but eventually after like 30 seconds or
06:07 - a minute go ahead and keep refreshing
06:09 - and eventually you're going to see that
06:11 - it is now issued which means that yes it
06:14 - was uh verified you own the domain name
06:16 - you're good to go
06:17 - and now once you see the screen check
06:19 - mark head back into your cloudfront
06:23 - distribution settings
06:24 - in here where we just came from uh under
06:28 - this custom SSL certificate option we
06:31 - can just go ahead and refresh this list
06:33 - by clicking this button and now you
06:36 - should see your certificate right here
06:38 - so this is my new one that we just set
06:40 - up and all of these defaults are good to
06:43 - go just go ahead and hit save changes
06:46 - now
06:47 - and then we also need to wait probably a
06:50 - minute or so for this to deploy however
06:53 - at the end of that
06:56 - all right so that actually only took
06:58 - like 20 seconds or so but we can now see
07:01 - if we go to vitaxia.io
07:04 - it now is pretty much pointing to our
07:06 - cloudfront distribution and also you can
07:10 - see by this little lock icon and this
07:13 - https it is now served over SSL and yeah
07:18 - everything is uh good to go so that
07:21 - ladies and gentlemen is how you set up
07:23 - your domain name to point to your Cloud
07:26 - friend distribution set up your domain
07:28 - name for your front end
07:29 - and yeah so uh thanks for watching and
07:32 - I'll see you next time
