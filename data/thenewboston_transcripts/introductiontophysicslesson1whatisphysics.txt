00:00 - what is going on guys my name is Bucky
00:02 - Roberts and welcome to your very first
00:04 - tutorial in physics now in these
00:07 - upcoming tutorials what I'm going to be
00:08 - doing is I'm basically going to be
00:10 - treating this as an introductory physics
00:12 - course if you were to take it in high
00:14 - school or college or anywhere else I'm
00:17 - going to be teaching you the basic core
00:19 - principles to get guys started in
00:22 - physics and by that I mean I'm going to
00:24 - be teaching you about mass force
00:26 - velocity you know the properties of
00:29 - matter all that fun stuff so that's what
00:32 - I'm going to be doing that's what you
00:33 - guys have to look forward to but before
00:36 - we started making any weird calculations
00:38 - or anything like that I think it's
00:40 - important to understand the definition
00:42 - you know the proper definition of
00:44 - physics and that is the study of matter
00:46 - and energy now there's no like one
00:50 - proper definition of physics but you
00:52 - know if you look around the web in all
00:54 - your textbooks this pretty much sums up
00:56 - what physics is studying matter and
00:59 - energy and how they interact with each
01:01 - other pretty much studying all the
01:03 - things that you can measure so you're
01:06 - saying all right so it's pretty much the
01:07 - study of like everything on earth whoa
01:10 - not exactly saying all right so what are
01:13 - some of the topics that physics doesn't
01:15 - touch on well we're going to be talking
01:18 - about topics like love physics is not
01:21 - going to cover passion I'm sorry but if
01:24 - you're here looking to study passion
01:26 - you're in the wrong place
01:27 - courageousness well I might touch on
01:30 - that a little bit but it has nothing to
01:32 - do with physics so those are some topics
01:35 - that you know we can't measure with
01:36 - physics what we can measure is like
01:38 - volume the speed of light you know all
01:41 - that boring stuff but by the way if
01:43 - you're looking for love and passion
01:44 - tutorials then I might be making some of
01:47 - those pretty soon by anyways that's what
01:49 - physics is that's the you know formal
01:51 - correct definition that's what you
01:53 - should write on your test so now let's
01:56 - go on to the next step and that is well
01:58 - whenever scientists are working with
02:02 - physics and they're working where these
02:04 - huge numbers such as you know how many
02:06 - atoms are in the Sun what's the speed of
02:09 - light well first of all I need to
02:10 - explain to you guys that these numbers
02:12 - are huge
02:13 - they're like you know billions and
02:16 - billions of billions of atoms inside the
02:18 - Sun numbers that I can't even really
02:20 - comprehend right now but we just can't
02:22 - write these numbers out like you know
02:24 - you to write how many brothers you have
02:26 - or how much you weigh because if you try
02:29 - to write the number of how many atoms
02:31 - were in the Sun it would take you like
02:33 - six years just to write it out on a
02:35 - piece of paper so what scientists did is
02:38 - they came up with a really lazy way to
02:41 - write really big in really small numbers
02:43 - and that is through the use of
02:45 - scientific notation now my definition of
02:50 - what scientific notation is is it's
02:52 - basically the way lazy scientists write
02:55 - big and small numbers now the technical
02:59 - definition is basically if you ever
03:01 - heard of power of 10 notation it's
03:03 - pretty much taking a number and timesing
03:06 - it by ten times a certain power and well
03:10 - let me go ahead and throw you guys into
03:12 - a nice example right here so let me go
03:15 - ahead and get my new stylus out what
03:17 - color am I going to choose blue looks
03:19 - pretty good so let's say we had a number
03:22 - like twenty eight thousand and seven
03:25 - hundred and we wanted to express that
03:28 - using scientific notation well what we
03:30 - would do is we would write two point
03:32 - eight seven and by the way I know my
03:34 - handwriting is really bad you guys are
03:37 - just going to have to deal with that so
03:39 - two point eight seven times 10 to the
03:43 - fourth power so this is basically the
03:45 - basics of scientific notation you have a
03:47 - number on the left here and you multiply
03:51 - it times 10 to a certain power and in
03:54 - this example the power is 4 but you can
03:57 - have any positive negative integer and
04:01 - you can also have 0 and I'm going to be
04:03 - showing you guys all those examples
04:05 - right now so all right how would we
04:07 - solve this problem so I told you guys
04:09 - that this number basically means the
04:11 - same as twenty eight thousand seven
04:14 - hundred don't believe me well I'm going
04:16 - to show you guys how to do that so you
04:17 - have two point eight seven times ten to
04:20 - the fourth power alright so we need to
04:22 - solve this baby right here so two point
04:24 - eight seven
04:26 - times 10 to the fourth power is 10 army
04:30 - excuse me it's one with four zero so one
04:33 - two three four so 10 to the fourth power
04:36 - is 10,000 and I'm not going to explain
04:39 - you guys how to do powers and you know
04:41 - exponents and stuff like that because
04:42 - I'm assuming you guys already know I
04:44 - don't think we need to jump back of that
04:46 - far so two point eight seven times
04:49 - 10,000 is twenty eight thousand seven
04:55 - hundred and by the way I'm going to show
04:57 - you guys a really lazy way to do a
05:00 - scientific notation and that's this let
05:02 - me go ahead and clear this so we can go
05:05 - ahead and make all those steps like
05:07 - convert 10 to the fourth power to 10,000
05:10 - and times this by 10,000 but you know
05:13 - that's one extra step and like I said we
05:15 - are scientists now and we are lazy so
05:17 - let's go ahead and look at the easier
05:19 - way if you have that same problem two
05:21 - point eight seven times 10 to the fourth
05:25 - power and you want to figure out you
05:28 - know everyday terms what this number
05:30 - meant what we could do is say alright
05:33 - whenever we have a number that's like 10
05:35 - to the fourth power all we have to do is
05:37 - take this decimal point and move it to
05:40 - the right four spaces so two point eight
05:44 - seven equals times 10 to the fourth of
05:48 - course equals one two three four
05:53 - and whenever we don't have anything we
05:55 - just go ahead and throw in zeroes and
05:56 - check it out this is twenty eight
05:59 - thousand seven hundred pretty cool huh
06:03 - so it kind of saves you a step you kind
06:05 - of draw these things that look like
06:06 - boobs kind of but you know oh well so
06:09 - let me go ahead and edit and clear that
06:11 - out and now let me show you guys
06:13 - remember when I told you guys that the
06:15 - exponents can be negative two well
06:18 - whenever they have a number in they
06:19 - times it by 10/2 like the negative fifth
06:22 - or something like that that means that
06:23 - you have a really small number so say
06:26 - you have something like let me go ahead
06:29 - and change my colors up um let me think
06:32 - of something five point two six
06:35 - times 10 to the negative 5 well the very
06:41 - first thing we need to do is 5.26 times
06:45 - and convert 10 to the negative 5 so
06:48 - again I'm not going to talk you guys
06:49 - through how exponents work but 10 to the
06:52 - negative 5 is point zero zero zero zero
06:57 - one so five point two six times point
07:00 - zero zero zero zero one is point zero
07:05 - zero zero zero four zeroes five two six
07:10 - so that's your answer right there I kind
07:13 - of drew over my decimal point so again
07:16 - if we want to do this the lazy way
07:18 - because remember we're scientists now
07:20 - have to do everything lazy 5.26 times 10
07:26 - to the negative fifth equals five point
07:30 - two six and whenever we have negative
07:33 - just go ahead and move your decimal
07:35 - point to the left five spaces so one two
07:40 - three four five well I got to work on my
07:43 - curvature there anyways just go ahead
07:46 - and fill in those zeros where you moved
07:48 - it and check it out point zero zero zero
07:52 - zero five two six so that's kind of a
07:55 - lazy way of doing things but hey it
07:57 - saves us this step right here so now the
07:59 - last example I want to tell you guys is
08:01 - about that zero with exponent because
08:04 - remember I told you guys you can have a
08:05 - positive integer or negative integer for
08:08 - your exponent but you can also have zero
08:10 - so if you have something like six point
08:13 - nine times ten to the zero of power the
08:19 - very first thing we have to figure out
08:20 - is all right what the heck is ten to the
08:22 - zeroth power and if you remember from
08:24 - like fifth grade math anything to the
08:27 - zero of power is one so this pretty much
08:29 - means our a six point nine times one and
08:33 - again anything anything times one is
08:36 - itself so this answer is six point nine
08:40 - again I don't really have a lazy way of
08:42 - doing this because pretty much this is
08:45 - really lazy in itself any time you have
08:48 - times ten
08:49 - zero of power just get rid of all this
08:51 - and that's your answer right there six
08:54 - point nine so that is your very first
08:56 - physics tutorial I hope you guys liked
08:59 - it and again I'm going to show you the
09:01 - lazy way I'm going to show you like the
09:03 - technical correct way to do all this
09:05 - stuff and then I'm going to show you
09:06 - like you know the lazy way where you can
09:08 - get away with it so it's going to be
09:10 - real fun and yeah I'm going to work on
09:12 - you know moving my decimal places get
09:15 - them giving them a little bit better and
09:17 - up you guys stay tuned for the next
09:18 - tutorial is going to be awesome so thank
09:20 - you guys for watching and I'll see you
09:21 - then
