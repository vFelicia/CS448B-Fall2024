00:00 - what is up guys it's Bucky and welcome
00:02 - to your 10th JavaScript tutorial and I
00:05 - hope that you guys are ready to have
00:07 - your minds blown because that's what I'm
00:09 - about to do in this tutorial because in
00:11 - this tutorial I'm going to teach you
00:13 - guys how to call a function from another
00:16 - function H interesting so let's go ahead
00:19 - and start with two functions function um
00:22 - I'll just go ahead and name the first
00:23 - one do first and it won't take any
00:26 - parameters and for the body let's just
00:29 - go ahead and you know give it something
00:30 - simple we'll just print something out on
00:31 - the screen um so right
00:35 - document
00:38 - right and what's something stupid we can
00:40 - put I am first bro or B hey who the heck
00:45 - cares and for our second function go
00:48 - ahead and type function we'll name this
00:50 - do second if you couldn't guess that and
00:53 - we're just going to write on this
00:56 - document right and right
01:01 - just write like the bunch of twos or
01:03 - something for a second I don't know I'm
01:04 - not really uh creative tonight but
01:06 - anyways so we have two functions do
01:08 - first and do second and these are
01:11 - functions that we're going to call from
01:13 - another function so let's go ahead and
01:15 - make that function right now we'll just
01:17 - go ahead and name this function start
01:19 - since this will be the starting point so
01:22 - let's go ahead and this won't take any
01:23 - parameters either all this function is
01:25 - going to do is call other functions so
01:28 - first is going to call do first
01:30 - and then it's going to call do
01:33 - second so now if we go ahead and run
01:35 - this program nothing is going to happen
01:37 - because we just have three functions
01:39 - right here pumped up and ready to go but
01:41 - we we never even used any of them yet so
01:44 - go ahead refresh and check it out I'm
01:46 - refreshing nothing is happening and
01:49 - that's like I said we have three
01:50 - functions right here pumped up ready to
01:52 - go but we didn't start it off we didn't
01:54 - call any of those functions first so go
01:57 - ahead in your program and let's start it
01:59 - off by saying start semicolon so now
02:02 - it's going to say all right you got a
02:03 - function you got a function you got a
02:05 - function and now the first thing I'm
02:07 - going to do is called the starting
02:09 - function right now so I go up to the
02:11 - starting function what do you want me to
02:12 - do do first function so then I go up to
02:15 - the do first function and print out I am
02:18 - first bow so this is actually the first
02:20 - thing it's going to print out right here
02:21 - and it says all right I'm done with the
02:23 - first function now what okay you told me
02:26 - to go do the second function so I'll go
02:28 - up here and print out to okay so
02:31 - basically print out this and print out
02:33 - this and then I'm done so let's go ahead
02:35 - and save this and see what we got I am
02:37 - first bow and
02:39 - 22222 so basically the only function
02:43 - that ran is the starting function and
02:45 - then all this one did is it called the
02:48 - first one and called the second one and
02:50 - then it quit and that's our whole entire
02:52 - program so anyways what I want to show
02:55 - you is you can use functions like the
02:57 - starting function to start it off and
03:00 - call other function and you actually do
03:03 - that a lot of the time so for example if
03:05 - you have a lot of code you can organize
03:07 - some in the do first organize some in
03:09 - the do second and it makes it a lot
03:11 - cleaner than having this huge long list
03:13 - of code you can break it up into nice
03:15 - little functions and then later on when
03:17 - you see all right something weird is
03:19 - going on with this first function you
03:20 - know what bit of code is messing up so
03:22 - anyways that's why functions come in
03:24 - handy but now that I have time and that
03:26 - tutorial took me a little quicker than I
03:28 - thought I get I bet you guys are
03:30 - wondering this what would you do if you
03:32 - had a function like first and then it
03:35 - called the second and then that one
03:36 - called the first which would call the
03:38 - second and it was just like an endless
03:40 - loop well I'm not sure but hey I never
03:43 - did it before but let's go ahead and
03:45 - find out my guess is that my computer is
03:47 - going to blow up but you guess uh in the
03:49 - comment box what you think is going to
03:50 - happen below my computer just might
03:52 - freeze or something but well I'll make
03:54 - Soro again so function do
03:58 - first and I don't recommend doing this
04:00 - but let's go ahead and just document.
04:04 - write something on the
04:06 - screen uh just write first we'll make it
04:08 - simple and then what we're going to do
04:11 - is call another doc function from here
04:14 - and the doc function function do
04:19 - second let's just go ahead and have this
04:23 - one write out on the
04:26 - screen um just write out a second and
04:29 - let's add some spaces
04:32 - actually first and second so it isn't
04:35 - all jumble together if if it actually
04:37 - does print out and then this one is
04:38 - going to call do first so basically
04:41 - what's going to happen is whenever you
04:43 - call one of these functions it's going
04:44 - to print something out call the other
04:46 - function print something out call the
04:47 - other function print call Print call
04:51 - Print call Print call I'm just going to
04:53 - do that for like the next 3 minutes
04:55 - until you get tired of me and go watch
04:57 - another video but anyways it's just
04:59 - going to go back and forth but if we run
05:01 - it right now nothing's going to happen
05:03 - because we just have two functions
05:04 - waiting there we didn't call any of them
05:06 - yet so now let's go ahead and start off
05:08 - and call do
05:10 - first so the first thing it's going to
05:12 - do is call this first function and then
05:14 - from there it's just going to be an
05:15 - endless Circle so now let's go ahead and
05:18 - save it and when I refresh this I'm kind
05:20 - of scared to press it all right I'll do
05:23 - it
05:25 - whoa so then it just printed out an
05:27 - endless list of first and second I
05:30 - wonder if this even stopped printing out
05:33 - yeah it finally just gave up so so
05:36 - that's pretty cool actually that Mozilla
05:38 - Firefox just give up after a certain
05:40 - amount of time so yeah that's what I
05:43 - would do too that's why I had to drop
05:45 - out of college just gave up after a
05:47 - certain amount of time but anyways there
05:49 - you have it how to make an endless loop
05:51 - of functions again I wouldn't recommend
05:53 - that in any of your programming and if
05:55 - you're going to interview for a job
05:57 - please do not mention this and do not
05:59 - mention mention my name or my reputation
06:01 - would be ruined but for now thank you
06:03 - guys for watching my tutorial I hope you
06:04 - guys enjoyed it and I guess I'll see you
06:06 - later
