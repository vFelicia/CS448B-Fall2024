00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - creating a hover over effect um over um
00:10 - an element in HTML so just taking a look
00:14 - at this example quickly I've got a link
00:16 - just here and I've got an image just
00:18 - below that now the overall effect we're
00:21 - trying to achieve is when we hover over
00:23 - a particular element we're going to take
00:25 - a description from a custom custom
00:28 - attribute that we give this element
00:30 - and then we're going to display it in a
00:32 - box as we hover over so the effect's
00:34 - quite cool and it's it's found on quite
00:36 - a few uh websites mainly when you have
00:40 - uh content you know you want to show
00:42 - your users or give your users a
00:44 - description of the content as they hover
00:45 - over be it an image uh a link or
00:48 - anything else so you can see that when I
00:50 - hover over Google I've got this div uh
00:53 - element that's following my cursor and
00:56 - it has a description which says Google a
00:58 - powerful search engine so the link still
01:00 - works we can go ahead and click on it
01:02 - and and go over to that link uh but
01:04 - we've assigned a particular class to
01:06 - this link to allow us to display this
01:09 - description uh accordingly uh we can
01:11 - also use it with images as well so you
01:14 - can see I've got a Tartan pattern here
01:17 - and my description here a lovely Tartan
01:19 - pattern so that will work as long as the
01:21 - cursor is hovered over this particular
01:23 - element so the way I've created the code
01:26 - for this tutorial is so you can easily
01:29 - use it and modify it uh not modify it
01:32 - really I mean you can feel free to
01:33 - modify if you like but the the overall
01:36 - idea of this is so we can really easily
01:39 - and quickly um
01:41 - add um more elements so if we wanted to
01:45 - go ahead and create the link we can do
01:47 - but then to create the image all we need
01:49 - to do is create an image and we don't
01:51 - need to modify the jQuery code
01:53 - whatsoever so the reason I've done it
01:55 - this way is is it because it acts more
01:57 - like a plugin so you only have to ever
02:00 - include a div element on your page if
02:02 - you want to use um this uh feature uh
02:06 - and then you can go ahead and add
02:08 - elements and add in the descriptions
02:10 - straight into the element into an
02:11 - attribute and this will work so as long
02:14 - as you follow this tutorial and complete
02:16 - it and everything works you can go ahead
02:18 - and actually use this throughout your
02:20 - website and use it on any any element
02:23 - whatsoever so now that you've seen an
02:25 - example we're going to go ahead and look
02:27 - at start creating this and start uh
02:29 - testing out these uh the specific
02:31 - functionality that makes this work uh
02:33 - and we'll eventually end up with an
02:35 - effect like this so let's go ahead and
02:37 - start writing the
02:39 - code okay so we're over to our text
02:42 - editor uh we have an HTML 5 template
02:45 - just laid out the important includes
02:47 - that we need are the stylesheet which I
02:50 - have opened just here uh and I've
02:51 - included that just here um and we
02:55 - obviously need jQuery included as well
02:57 - and I've kept this in my Js folder so
03:00 - taking a look at the directory structure
03:02 - we have
03:03 - index.php we've got style.css which can
03:06 - be found in the CSS folder and we then
03:08 - have jquery.js which is found in the JS
03:12 - folder so we need to create an external
03:14 - script that's going to handle specific
03:17 - operations or specific event handler uh
03:19 - handling so we need to go ahead and just
03:21 - create a new document uh and I'm going
03:23 - to save that inside the JS folder and
03:26 - I'm going to call this uh hover text. Js
03:31 - so now that I've got hover text. JS I
03:33 - want to go and um actually include this
03:36 - on my page so we do exactly the same as
03:39 - we would with jQuery and we just include
03:41 - this as a script include uh inside of
03:44 - our page and that's going to mean that
03:45 - everything we write in uh hover text. JS
03:49 - uh will be able to be used inside uh
03:51 - this page so hovertext do
03:55 - JS okay so now that we've got that
03:57 - included we're going to go ahead and
03:58 - create a link and test some um hover
04:02 - hover over or sorry not hover over uh
04:05 - Mouse move uh event handling so let's go
04:08 - ahead and create our link and I'm just
04:12 - going to call this Google as I did
04:13 - before uh set the link uh
04:18 - location and let's go ahead and just
04:20 - refresh our page so I've got Google um
04:23 - the standard link just on a page and it
04:25 - works so we need to think about um how
04:28 - we're going to handle um the hover well
04:32 - hovering over this and then displaying
04:34 - the um div that we're going to create in
04:38 - just a moment in style. CSS so let's go
04:40 - ahead do uh h.j in just a moment I
04:44 - almost forgot to assign a class to this
04:46 - I'm going to assign a class to this
04:48 - called hover
04:51 - link Now by assigning a class to this
04:54 - you can then go ahead uh and create
04:56 - other elements on your page with the
04:57 - same um class
05:00 - and uh oh no I'm just going to call this
05:02 - hover sorry uh we can assign a class to
05:04 - any element on our page called hover uh
05:07 - and that will allow us to take advantage
05:08 - of the functionality that we're going to
05:10 - build around this so now that we've
05:12 - assigned a class to it we can come over
05:14 - to hover text.
05:16 - JS and we can uh select this particular
05:19 - class so we use a selector uh we use a
05:22 - DOT and then we say hover now we're
05:24 - going to assign an event handler to this
05:26 - to uh handle the event when the mouse
05:29 - moves over this particular element or
05:31 - the element with the class hover so I'm
05:33 - going to say mouse
05:35 - move now inside here we need to go ahead
05:38 - and create a function so I just outline
05:40 - a function and then we just come down
05:42 - and we can start writing code in here so
05:45 - the code that I'm just going to write
05:46 - for now is going to be
05:48 - alert Mouse over or Mouse move and what
05:53 - this is going to do is on any element
05:55 - that has hover I.E I'll link just at the
05:58 - moment
06:00 - when the mouse moves over it we're going
06:01 - to alert out Mouse move so quite simple
06:04 - stuff um but when I move over you can
06:07 - see that it says Mouse
06:08 - move so now that we have this in place
06:11 - we know that we've got the functionality
06:13 - required to return perhaps specific
06:16 - coordinates uh of where the mouse uh is
06:19 - on this element
