00:00 - so today we're gonna go over the
00:03 - circumference of a circle circumference
00:07 - is the distance around the outside of a
00:09 - circle so it's basically like the
00:13 - perimeter of a circle it's just called
00:15 - circumference because it's you can't
00:19 - take a perimeter of a circle because of
00:24 - its route because it's round so you
00:26 - don't just add up the distances like you
00:28 - want to find perimeter but you're still
00:32 - finding how long this blue arc is so
00:41 - circumference is equal to PI times D or
00:45 - 2 pi R so D is the diameter so D is this
00:53 - whole line right here R is the radius
00:58 - which is d is equal to 2 because the
01:03 - radius is just this piece right here
01:06 - diameter is this whole part so this
01:10 - thing this funny-looking thing right
01:12 - here is called pi and it's we have to
01:17 - multiply diameter by PI to find
01:19 - circumference if you're good if you want
01:22 - the exact value of the circumference
01:24 - you'll write C is equal to like 12 pi
01:28 - but if they ask for an approximation of
01:31 - C you're gonna say pi is approximately
01:35 - 3.14 pi is a non repeating decimal so it
01:41 - just keeps going on and on forever so
01:43 - there's no way to get exactly
01:45 - circumference unless you write it like
01:47 - this but if you wanted to approximate it
01:50 - you'd take 12 times 3.14 and if you plug
01:55 - it into a calculator you'll get 36 point
01:59 - six eight but that's just an example
02:05 - so now we're gonna do some more examples
02:07 - find the circumference so this is the
02:10 - center of the circle so this is the
02:13 - radius so to find our area we're gonna
02:17 - take two PI R so for an exact value
02:25 - we'll get 16 pi for an approximation
02:30 - we'll get 16 times 3.14 you plug that
02:36 - into a calculator you'll get 15 point 2
02:38 - 4 so when we have an exact value we use
02:42 - equal signs but when we approximate the
02:46 - circumference we're gonna use these
02:48 - little wavy lines and that just signals
02:50 - that we approximated it and that this is
02:53 - not the act exact value of the
02:57 - circumference it's pretty close it's
03:00 - just not exact so if I'm a circumference
03:05 - this time we're given diameter but if we
03:10 - wanted to do the 2 PI R 1 7 PI D 1 we
03:14 - would just divide 15 by 2 you get 7.5
03:17 - but I think it's just easier to use pi
03:23 - times diameter so for an exact value we
03:27 - get circumference is equal to 15 pi for
03:31 - an approximation we get 40 won't we get
03:41 - forty seven point one inches now since
03:48 - we're doing the distance around the
03:51 - circle we're gonna be in just inches
03:56 - because circumference is a
03:57 - one-dimensional measure unlike area
04:00 - which is two-dimensional so that's
04:04 - actually all we have for today
04:06 - but make sure you come next time where
04:08 - we'll be finding the area of a circle
