00:02 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:05 - proving lines are perpendicular now we
00:09 - haven't done any proofs yet proving that
00:11 - lines are perpendicular but we've talked
00:14 - about what perpendicular lines mean they
00:19 - intersect to form right
00:21 - angles and they have opposite reciprocal
00:24 - slopes but today we're going to use the
00:26 - fact that they intersect to form right
00:29 - angles to prove that these two lines a b
00:33 - d or excuse me that b d is perpendicular
00:37 - to a c so we're
00:41 - given that
00:44 - AB is equal
00:48 - to
00:52 - CB and that b d bisects this angle right
00:58 - here ABC
01:00 - so prove that b d is perpendicular to
01:05 - AC so first thing we're going to do is
01:08 - rewrite our
01:09 - given
01:11 - AB congruent to
01:15 - CB
01:17 - BD
01:20 - BCT uh I'll just fit that right there
01:24 - this is going to be um one of the longer
01:27 - proofs we've done so I got to save some
01:29 - room so I can fit it all on here and the
01:32 - reason for that is
01:34 - given
01:36 - okay so you're probably wondering how do
01:40 - we prove that these are parallel or
01:43 - perpendicular well to do that we have to
01:46 - prove that they're right angles but to
01:48 - do that what we're going to try and do
01:51 - is get them to be
01:53 - congruent so first we're going to try
01:55 - and get these triangles congruent which
01:58 - is always a good place to start if
02:00 - you're not really sure where to
02:02 - go like which direction to go in when
02:05 - proving something if there's triangles
02:07 - you probably want to get them
02:10 - congruent so next we we're going to take
02:13 - the definition of BCT which we talked
02:15 - about in our last lesson and rewrite or
02:19 - write the next statement so if B D
02:22 - bisects AB C that means it splits it up
02:25 - into two congruent angles so this angle
02:30 - is congruent to this angle so angle a b
02:34 - e is congruent to angle e b
02:40 - c oh I'm sorry I wrote that
02:44 - wrong I didn't write it in the same
02:46 - order this should be c b e and
02:50 - that's
02:52 - if
02:54 - bisects two angles that are congruent we
02:59 - have two angles that that are
03:01 - congruent okay so
03:05 - now we're almost there we have a side
03:09 - and an angle congruent to a side and an
03:12 - angle and if you look they share this
03:14 - side be e and we've used this many times
03:19 - that be e is congruent to be e and
03:24 - that's
03:26 - reflexive
03:28 - property
03:31 - so now we can get these two triangles
03:35 - congruent triangle a b e congruent to
03:40 - Triangle CB e I'm just going to name
03:43 - them the same way I name these two
03:45 - angles and that's by side angle
03:51 - side and you have to remember that this
03:54 - angle is the included angle of those two
03:58 - sides see if we knew that this one was
04:02 - congruent to this one we couldn't use
04:05 - side angle side for
04:07 - that
04:08 - okay so now we can get like I was saying
04:13 - we can get be
04:15 - EA I'm going to use a different color we
04:18 - can get this angle congruent to this
04:22 - angle so angle b e a is congruent to
04:28 - angle b e C and that's if two triangles
04:34 - are congruent and then I'm just going to
04:36 - abbreviate this so I save space
04:40 - corresponding parts are also
04:45 - congruent so then if you look these two
04:50 - angles right here have a special kind of
04:54 - relationship they
04:57 - are they are supplementary
05:00 - because they form a linear pair which if
05:03 - you remember one of our linear pairs is
05:06 - supplementary angles so then we can
05:10 - say that the measure of angle be EA plus
05:16 - the measure of angle b e c is equal to
05:21 - 180Â° and that's the reason for that is
05:24 - if
05:25 - two
05:27 - angles form
05:30 - a linear pair and I'm going to have to
05:32 - abbreviate that too
05:35 - then
05:37 - they are
05:45 - supplementary okay so next we can say
05:51 - and you don't know this reason yet
05:54 - because we haven't talked about it yet
05:56 - but next we can conclude that that angle
06:00 - b e a and angle b e c are right angles
06:08 - now we can conclude this because if two
06:13 - angles are congruent and
06:16 - supplementary then the angles must be
06:19 - right angles because if we were solving
06:21 - this mathematically we knew that they're
06:24 - 80 180 and since they're congruent
06:26 - they're two equal parts we would divide
06:29 - 180 0 by 2 and get them both equal to 90
06:33 - so that's why we can say that these two
06:35 - are right angles so if angles are
06:39 - congruent and
06:44 - supplementary
06:46 - then
06:48 - right angles and now we have one last
06:54 - step to say that
06:58 - BD is perfect perpendicular to
07:01 - AC
07:03 - because if right
07:07 - angles
07:08 - lines are
07:10 - perpendicular because right angles are
07:12 - only formed by perpendicular
07:15 - lines so that's the only proof we're
07:17 - going to do proving that lines are
07:21 - perpendicular but make sure you come
07:23 - back and watch our next
07:25 - lesson where we're going
07:28 - to do more proofs using the definition
07:33 - of a
07:34 - rectangle
