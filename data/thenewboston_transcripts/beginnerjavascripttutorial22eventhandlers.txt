00:00 - what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - your 22nd tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - we're going to be beginning to talk
00:06 - about something called event handlers
00:08 - now an event handler is basically our
00:11 - first step towards creating a more
00:13 - interactive and dynamic web page an
00:16 - event handler is basically running a bit
00:19 - of JavaScript code in response to a user
00:22 - action for example whenever they roll
00:24 - over a button or whenever they click a
00:26 - mouse this is when we can set the
00:28 - JavaScript code to run and instead of
00:30 - just running everything right as the web
00:32 - page loan so as you can see instead of
00:35 - just making everything happen when the
00:37 - web page loads we wait for the user's
00:39 - action and it creates the feel of or
00:42 - like an interaction so let's go ahead
00:44 - and enough of me talking it's a lot
00:46 - easier if you just see what's going on
00:47 - so let me go ahead and mention a few
00:49 - things first first of all when you're
00:52 - you're working with event handlers you
00:54 - don't always need to place the
00:56 - JavaScript inside those two special
00:59 - scripting tags event handlers are it's
01:03 - kind of special you can it's possible to
01:06 - make it outside those scripting tags and
01:08 - for the first example that's what I'm
01:10 - going to show you guys how to do so
01:12 - aside from that I better mention this
01:15 - event handlers can be placed in many
01:18 - locations on a web page they kind of
01:20 - look like just basic xhtml attributes
01:23 - but instead of like writing um color
01:27 - equals blue instead of writing a value
01:29 - like like blue this is where you insert
01:32 - the JavaScript so let's go ahead and I
01:34 - guess it would be easiest for me to just
01:37 - make one so one place you can insert
01:40 - event handlers are in form elements
01:44 - specifically um form buttons so let's go
01:47 - ahead and make a form and we'll go ahead
01:49 - and insert some event handlers in here
01:51 - so go ahead and make your basic
01:53 - form and then go ahead and make a one
01:57 - input we only need one input just a b
01:59 - basic button on the screen and in case
02:01 - you forgot from xhtml tutorials how to
02:03 - do this you just go ahead and write
02:05 - input type
02:08 - equals button and for the value the
02:12 - value is basically what is your button
02:14 - going to say and we'll just write touch
02:17 - me so let's go ahead and end this right
02:19 - now and we'll see what we got we got a
02:22 - basic plain old button on the screen
02:24 - doesn't do anything you just click it a
02:26 - bunch of times and nothing happens
02:28 - pretty boring huh so let's go ahead and
02:31 - use event handlers to spice this up a
02:33 - bit now event handlers are pretty much
02:37 - built in keywords that your computer
02:40 - recognizes and knows that it's
02:42 - JavaScript you don't have to tell it in
02:44 - another function that it's JavaScript
02:46 - your browser automatically knows the
02:48 - event handler so whoever created your
02:50 - browser they already typed them in there
02:52 - for you so the only thing you have to
02:54 - remember is these different keywords for
02:56 - event handlers and the most well I don't
02:59 - want to say common L used because I
03:00 - never did a survey on it but one of the
03:02 - most commonly used event handlers is
03:04 - called on click and make sure the C is
03:07 - capitalize and this is a keyword that
03:10 - says whenever the user clicks this
03:13 - element and in this case a button right
03:16 - here then I want to run the bit of
03:18 - JavaScript code in here so anything you
03:22 - type in between these quotation marks it
03:24 - has to be JavaScript code and that's
03:26 - what's going to be ran whenever the user
03:28 - clicks this button so go ahead and I'm
03:30 - just going to make a basic alert box so
03:32 - go ahead and type alert and add your
03:34 - parameters but check this out you know
03:37 - however we make an alert that we usually
03:39 - type some text into it and we put it in
03:41 - double quotation marks like hey now or
03:43 - something like that well since we're
03:45 - working inside xhtml attribute right now
03:48 - and we have all these double quotation
03:50 - marks these quotation marks right here
03:52 - tell JavaScript or excuse me tell your
03:54 - browser that we're working with
03:56 - attributes so we can't use those same
03:59 - quotation marks in here so instead of
04:01 - double quotation marks we need to use
04:03 - single quotation marks so we don't
04:05 - confuse it so it doesn't really have an
04:07 - effect on your program at all it just
04:10 - differentiates between the double ones
04:12 - for your attributes and the single ones
04:14 - for your JavaScript so go ahead put
04:16 - single quotation marks in your parameter
04:18 - and go ahead and write something like ah
04:20 - or write something stupid and now just
04:23 - like in JavaScript with every statement
04:25 - we have to end it with a semicolon this
04:27 - lets our browser know that we're done
04:29 - running this bit of JavaScript code so
04:31 - go ahead and save that refresh it and
04:33 - our web page looks the same right now
04:36 - but in fact it's not the same because
04:37 - whenever we touch this button check it
04:39 - out an alert box pops up that says Ah
04:42 - pretty cool so let's go ahead and press
04:44 - okay and that's the basic of an event
04:46 - handler so as you can see before
04:49 - whenever we were working with JavaScript
04:52 - our web page loaded and all the
04:54 - JavaScript ran and it did whatever it
04:56 - did and that was basically it but now we
04:59 - can wait for the user input and whenever
05:02 - they do something such as click button
05:04 - then the JavaScript code runs and it's
05:07 - just a way to make the web page more
05:08 - interactive and more Dynamic so aside
05:11 - from that I guess I have time to mention
05:13 - one more thing you know how I added one
05:15 - statement in there on the onclick
05:17 - attribute and whenever you touched it a
05:19 - bit of JavaScript code ran well since we
05:21 - added a semicolon we can add more than
05:24 - one statement in here so for example
05:26 - let's go ahead and add one alert box
05:28 - that says Ah and let's go ahead and add
05:30 - another one right after that so
05:33 - alert and of course remember to use your
05:35 - single quotes right in here and just go
05:38 - ahead and write like two times or
05:40 - something different from your first so
05:42 - you can tell that it's different so now
05:44 - we have two different statements
05:46 - whenever we click it using this onclick
05:48 - event handler first it says alert a and
05:52 - then it says alert two times pretty
05:54 - stupid but hey it works so I just
05:57 - clicked the button and it wasn't even in
05:59 - the screen so so check it out touch it
06:01 - ah press okay and then it
06:07 - says oh I didn't refresh it there we go
06:10 - touch it uh and check it out two times
06:13 - and you might have this uh happening if
06:16 - your code isn't running exactly how you
06:18 - want it in some browsers in order to
06:21 - prevent a bunch of ads from popping up
06:24 - or if you have any um like anti anti-ad
06:28 - uh what's it called anti virus or
06:30 - anti-py we built on your computer only
06:32 - one popup will pop up and it's not
06:35 - because your code is wrong it's because
06:36 - your browser has thinks that you're
06:39 - trying to post a whole bunch of ads so
06:41 - it only pop up one at a time so if
06:43 - that's happening then that's your
06:45 - browser not your code but anyways what I
06:47 - want to show you guys here is you're not
06:49 - limited to only one statement you can
06:50 - add more than one statement you can add
06:52 - 500 if you want but you see how I added
06:55 - two statements right in here whenever
06:58 - you have like three or more statements
07:00 - it's probably easier just to add a
07:01 - function and then whenever you make your
07:04 - function uh before you can just add all
07:07 - your statements in there but for now
07:09 - this is just a quick example so there
07:11 - you go so anyways that's the basics of
07:14 - of an event handler I showed you on
07:16 - click in this tutorial but in the next
07:18 - tutorial we're going to be going over
07:19 - different types of event handlers and
07:22 - you'll begin to see why they're useful
07:23 - and what we can do with them so that's
07:25 - what you got to look forward to if you
07:27 - have any questions check out my website
07:28 - or ask me on my form form and I'll be
07:30 - happy to answer it for you so thank you
