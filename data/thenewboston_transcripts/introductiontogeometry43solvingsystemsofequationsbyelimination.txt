00:00 - So today we're going to learn the two
00:02 - other ways to solve systems of
00:06 - equations so the first way is by
00:09 - elimination so given two equations add a
00:13 - multiple of one to eliminate a
00:17 - variable so you're going to take the
00:20 - smaller
00:22 - equation or not the smaller equation but
00:26 - see how X in this equation is
00:30 - positive and this 2x is negative if I
00:35 - add a positive and a negative together
00:39 - they're going to cancel each other out
00:41 - so we want to take the x that has the
00:44 - smaller coefficient which is this one
00:46 - because this only has a coefficient of
00:48 - one we want to multiply it by something
00:51 - that'll allow it to cancel with this 2
00:55 - -2X so we want
00:58 - to multip ly this whole equation by two
01:02 - so we're going to multiply
01:06 - everything by two so we get 2 y = 2x + 4
01:14 - and we don't do anything with this one
01:16 - so now what we're going to
01:18 - do is we're going to
01:21 - write this equation right underneath
01:24 - it and we're going to add these two
01:27 - equations
01:28 - together so 2 y + y gives you 3 y
01:34 - 2x + a -2X gives you 0 x and 4 + -1
01:42 - gives you
01:44 - pos3 so now we have 3 Y is equal to 3 if
01:49 - you divide by 3 you get Y is equal to 1
01:54 - so now we have to take this Y and plug
01:57 - it into either one of these equations
02:01 - and we're going to do it into both of
02:03 - them just so you see that you'll get the
02:05 - exact same answer so
02:10 - y y is = x + 2 since we know Y is equal
02:15 - to 1 we're going to plug it in for y you
02:18 - get x + 2 if you subtract the two over
02:20 - you get x =
02:23 - -1 and if you plug it into this equation
02:27 - you get 1 is equal to -2X minus one if
02:31 - you add the one over you get 2 is equal
02:33 - to -2X if you divide by -2X you get X is
02:37 - equal to 1 so either way you're going to
02:41 - get X is
02:42 - equal to -1 and Y is equal to 1 and we
02:46 - always write this Final Solution as an
02:49 - ordered
02:52 - pair
02:54 - Okay
02:58 - so
03:01 - so now we're going to move on to the
03:03 - last way to solve system of equation so
03:08 - if you're given two equations you're
03:10 - going to put the coefficients into a
03:12 - matrix to solve so the coefficients are
03:16 - these numbers right
03:18 - here in front of the
03:22 - x's and on both of these y's there's an
03:26 - understood one as a
03:28 - coefficient
03:31 - so we're going to put these into a
03:33 - matric where we're going to put this
03:39 - coefficient right here
03:41 - so1 then we're going to put this
03:44 - coefficient right
03:47 - here and then we're going to
03:50 - put this
03:53 - one and then the same one right
03:57 - here over a
04:01 - matrix of two this first
04:08 - coefficient this coefficient
04:11 - again and then this
04:14 - one and this one so -1
04:19 - 1 and then you're going to
04:23 - get when you
04:26 - multiply majes you multiply this way so
04:31 - you're going to get
04:34 - -1 *
04:40 - 1us 1 *
04:45 - 2
04:48 - over you multiply across when you solve
04:52 - matrices 2 * 1 - -1 * 1 for your X
05:03 - matri so -1 * 1
05:07 - is-1 - 1 * 2 is 2 over 2 * 1 is 2 and
05:16 - then -1 * 1 is -1 so it's going to be+
05:21 - pos1 on the bottom so if you add 1 -2
05:26 - you get -3 over 3 so you get negative 1
05:31 - for x and then we're just GNA
05:33 - plug this
05:35 - x into this
05:38 - equation so 2 * -1 + y =
05:44 - -1 -2 + y = 1 add the two over you get Y
05:49 - is equal to 1 or you could put it in
05:52 - another
05:53 - matri for y you would do the same thing
05:57 - except it you would start here and then
06:01 - do this
06:04 - one so I'm going to show you how to do
06:07 - the y coordinate in a
06:10 - matric just so you know what to
06:17 - do
06:19 - okay for
06:21 - y we have we're going to start with this
06:26 - first coefficient
06:28 - here so
06:30 - two then this constant right
06:36 - here1
06:38 - over this first coefficient
06:42 - here1 and this constant here divided
06:50 - by the same first
06:54 - coefficient this
06:56 - coefficient and then these two
06:58 - coefficients 1 and one and you once
07:01 - again you cross
07:04 - multiply so you get 2 * 2 - -1 * -1 over
07:11 - 2 * 1 - -1 * 1 so here you get 4 --1 * 1
07:20 - gives you POS 1 so -
07:23 - pos1 over 2 1 * 1 gives you - 1 and when
07:29 - we minus a negative we actually add a
07:32 - positive so 2 +
07:35 - 1 so then we get 3
07:37 - over3 and as you can see we get one just
07:40 - like we did when we plugged it in so
07:43 - either way you can do it I just wanted
07:45 - you to know how to do it both
07:47 - ways so that's all that's all we have
07:52 - for today and this is our last lesson on
07:56 - solving systems of
07:57 - equations in the next next video we're
08:00 - going to start talking about circles
