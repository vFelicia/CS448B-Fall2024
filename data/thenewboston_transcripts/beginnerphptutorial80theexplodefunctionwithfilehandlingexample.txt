00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is a tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston now in this tutorial we're going
00:07 - to be learning to read data from a file
00:10 - but obviously when you're reading data
00:14 - from a file it's not always on a line by
00:15 - line basis you might find that you've
00:18 - got commas separating your values and in
00:20 - this case we've got a few names here
00:22 - with commas separating each value now
00:24 - how do we deal with reading this in now
00:28 - we've already seen examples of reading
00:30 - in file data but for now what we want to
00:32 - do is we want to create a handle as
00:36 - we've done previously I've got this
00:37 - names.txt up here but I'm just going to
00:39 - close it so it doesn't interfere with
00:42 - our program I don't change anything
00:45 - inside so handle equals F open and we
00:48 - want to pick a file to open which is
00:50 - names.txt and we're going to eat we're
00:53 - going to open this for reading so we're
00:55 - going to use an R here okay now what
00:58 - we're going to do is we need to create a
01:04 - way to read the contents of the file
01:07 - echo the contents of the file and that
01:09 - that's the first stage I'm going to take
01:12 - just echoing out the contents to the PHP
01:14 - page at the moment the it looks like
01:18 - this nothing's really happening
01:19 - so how do we do this what we do is we we
01:24 - echo F read and we take the handle in
01:29 - there now the second argument in this is
01:31 - the amount of data we want to read in
01:33 - for now I'm just going to type a
01:35 - thousand just to make sure we read in
01:36 - all the characters however well let's
01:39 - refresh first and you can see we've
01:41 - taken in all the data from the names txt
01:44 - far from Alex to sandra we've taken in
01:47 - all the data and we're displaying it now
01:49 - I don't want to read in a thousand bits
01:53 - or but I think it's byte so much I'm not
01:55 - too great with that but this is the
01:58 - amount of data it's reading in could be
02:00 - characters I'm not sure but something to
02:02 - look up
02:03 - so I want to take in the file size
02:07 - rather than keep specifying you know if
02:10 - I was reading in a massive long file I
02:11 - might say Oh we'll just read in that
02:13 - amount of characters
02:14 - you're wasting you're wasting it doesn't
02:18 - look neat either so what I want to do is
02:21 - I want to use a function called file
02:22 - size and then handle so basically all
02:26 - this is doing is taking the file size
02:27 - and reading in the file as a whole not
02:30 - any more not any less so let's see if
02:32 - that's worked oh right okay so okay
02:40 - basically what we've done is um as
02:42 - opposed to reading in the you know a
02:46 - particular file we're reading in this
02:48 - open file so what we need to do up here
02:51 - is we need to specify the file name so
02:53 - I'm going to specify the file name as
02:55 - names.txt that means that down here I
02:58 - can replace this with file name and then
03:01 - I can replace this with file name as
03:05 - well so now let's refresh and we should
03:07 - have that that file up ok so just to
03:10 - show you an example if I wanted to only
03:12 - read in say five we just get the first
03:17 - five characters of that so always use
03:21 - this file size and it will just open the
03:23 - exact amount of data within your file
03:26 - okay so and we don't want to echo this
03:30 - out but what we do want to do is put it
03:32 - in a variable so I'm going to call this
03:36 - variable data in now what we want to do
03:39 - with this is we want to split it up and
03:42 - our the character we want to split from
03:46 - is commas so let's refresh again all
03:49 - right
03:51 - echo that out and refresh now we want to
03:55 - split it up through commas and we use a
03:57 - function here called explode so I'm
04:02 - going to say names
04:06 - array equals explode what we do is we
04:11 - use we tell PHP the character we want to
04:15 - explode it with and then we read in the
04:19 - photo reading the what we want to
04:21 - explode so if for example in here we had
04:23 - Alex Billy Dale okay and we wanted to
04:29 - explode that we just be left with an
04:32 - array with Alex Billy and Dale but
04:36 - because we've got this data in variable
04:38 - with our data all data in I mean that's
04:42 - what we want to read in we want to read
04:45 - in this and we want Alex inner in an
04:47 - array element Billy
04:49 - Peter Dale so if we refresh nothing's
04:53 - happened no errors have occurred which
04:55 - is fine now to test this we can use the
04:59 - for each and we can say for each names
05:03 - array as name and what once there is
05:10 - echo name and then we just append a
05:16 - break on to that so essentially what
05:18 - we're doing is we're converting this
05:20 - file from a comma comma delimited file
05:23 - to a line by line echoing out to our
05:27 - browser and displaying the data to our
05:28 - browser so if we refresh hopefully that
05:30 - should work okay so you can see that
05:33 - they're now on a line by line basis now
05:35 - there's one thing that you need to
05:36 - notice when dealing with these files is
05:40 - that they do actually have extra extra
05:44 - spaces on I believe so let's just add a
05:47 - dot in there to test that another day
05:50 - okay that's absolutely fine that's work
05:52 - well
05:52 - okay so we've now got this data that's
05:55 - been read in on a common line for us
05:57 - we've used explode and we've read this
06:02 - in as an array so now what we can do is
06:04 - we can do anything we like this data
06:06 - because it's invalid it's in an element
06:08 - of an array for example let's just get
06:10 - rid of this if I wanted to say
06:13 - names array and so the say the first
06:22 - element of the array so the array with
06:24 - the key of 0 the key 0 has the value
06:27 - Alex because it's the first name in the
06:29 - list so we just reduce we're just
06:31 - reducing that down and printing out Alex
06:33 - or echoing out Alex so you can do
06:35 - anything you like with this data now
06:37 - that is in an array and we've done that
06:39 - simply by the explode function using a
06:42 - commerce say oh yeah it's separated by
06:44 - comma and if it was separated by spaces
06:47 - you could just use a space in here and
06:51 - then just reading in the data just here
06:53 - so that's how simple it is to read in
06:55 - sort of comma separated values within a
06:57 - file
