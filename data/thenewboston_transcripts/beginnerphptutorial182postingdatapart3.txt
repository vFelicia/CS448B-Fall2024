00:00 - so now we need to check for a state
00:02 - change or a ready state change from from
00:05 - our XML HTTP object so we say XML HTTP
00:09 - dot on ready state to change and then we
00:14 - equal this to a function so it so
00:19 - basically based on this event we create
00:21 - a new function and then inside here we
00:24 - can start checking our ready State and
00:26 - our status of our of our request so we
00:30 - say if and we say XML HTTP dot ready
00:35 - state remember our capital S here so
00:37 - case sensitive is equal to 4 and our XML
00:42 - HTTP status is also a status is equal to
00:48 - 200 this just means if the page is not
00:50 - blank or the request isn't blank coming
00:54 - then we complete the rest this block so
00:57 - if this is but if these are both true
00:59 - then we create what's in here so now
01:03 - under our insert field if you like here
01:07 - where we're typing our the value that we
01:09 - want to insert into our database
01:11 - we're going to create a div and what
01:13 - this div is going to do is it's going to
01:14 - feed back in information from our
01:16 - updating PHP file when we create it and
01:20 - the reason for this is when we've
01:22 - inserted the data we're going to tell
01:23 - the user that the data is being inserted
01:25 - but because we're doing this without
01:27 - refreshing the page we want to give a
01:29 - confirmation message inside a div so I'm
01:33 - going to call this div I've created a
01:34 - structure of the div here we don't need
01:35 - to put anything in here at the moment
01:37 - well at all I'm going to call the div
01:39 - message so this is just going to feed
01:41 - back information from our from our
01:46 - request our Ajax request and the the
01:49 - output in updating PHP is going to be
01:52 - put into this div so hopefully that
01:55 - makes sense otherwise continue to follow
01:57 - along and see what you think so we've
02:00 - got document dot get
02:03 - element by ID what I struggled with
02:07 - earlier and then we specify the name of
02:09 - the dip so in this case it's message and
02:11 - then what we do is we say inner dot
02:14 - sorry dot inner HTML and what this is
02:19 - going to do is it's going to set the
02:21 - HTML within out this specific div that
02:24 - we've specified so what we're going to
02:26 - do is I'm going to equal this to XML
02:28 - HTTP response text and all this
02:36 - basically is is it's the the output sent
02:39 - back from update Inc PHP because we're
02:42 - going to be opening this file later and
02:44 - sending post data to where I'm going to
02:47 - be taking back the response text from
02:49 - this file so that's important that we
02:51 - put that into message in order to let's
02:54 - say if we would say echo failed at any
02:58 - point in our program the in anytime in
03:01 - our script the message div would be
03:03 - updated so now that we've done that we
03:06 - can come down here and we can start to
03:08 - send our post data now if you watch the
03:12 - other tutorials you'll see that we used
03:14 - XML HTTP open and then we've supplied
03:17 - three parameters don't forget the
03:21 - semicolon at the end and we've supplied
03:24 - the first primary parameter was get the
03:26 - next was the file so this was update in
03:29 - PHP and then it was true because we're
03:32 - sending the data synchronously so we
03:33 - need to set this to true it's actually
03:35 - true by default but I tend to put it in
03:37 - anyway just to ensure that it's there
03:40 - etc etc etc just for my own peace of
03:43 - mind
03:43 - so now we set XML HTTP send now there's
03:48 - a few changes that we need to make when
03:50 - we're using post data you'll see that in
03:53 - some of the other tutorials I've put a
03:57 - question mark here to specify that we're
04:00 - going to be sending get data and I've
04:03 - sent some specific data so I've said for
04:05 - example
04:07 - text equals hello okay so what I've done
04:12 - there is
04:12 - I've sent get data because it's as part
04:15 - of the URL so let's go ahead and test
04:18 - this so we we can see that everything's
04:21 - working with regards to the the Ajax so
04:26 - at the moment what what this what this
04:28 - set Ajax will do is it will open this
04:30 - update dot PHP file or will it and it
04:33 - will pass through a variable called text
04:36 - which is a get variable with the value
04:38 - hello so what we can do inside here is
04:40 - just echo out dollar underscore get text
04:44 - and what that should do is it should
04:45 - react oh what we've entered into the
04:47 - text box because remember what we enter
04:50 - into the text box is being picked up
04:52 - sorry let's go back here
04:54 - what we enter into the text box will be
04:56 - picked up eventually by this so this
04:58 - will equal hello just for now and it
05:00 - will put that into our message div down
05:03 - here as I explained earlier so let's go
05:05 - ahead and check that this works let's
05:08 - click Submit and you can see that the
05:09 - value hello has been returned
05:12 - now obviously the problem with this at
05:14 - the moment is we've completely avoided
05:15 - the point of the tutorial we need to
05:18 - post data using post so the first thing
05:22 - we'll do is change this to post and I'm
05:24 - going to get rid of these variables and
05:27 - the end hits we don't post data through
05:29 - the URL
