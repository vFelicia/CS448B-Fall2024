00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:09 - look at some variants of the do until
00:11 - and the do while loop now let's go ahead
00:14 - and get started we'll create a new
00:16 - project make sure you have selected
00:19 - console
00:20 - application and we'll go ahead and name
00:22 - this more do
00:25 - loops and just go ahead and click okay
00:29 - now let's wait for that to look and then
00:30 - zoom
00:32 - in okay so if you remember from the last
00:35 - tutorial we covered the do while Loops
00:39 - now let's say you have a block of code
00:42 - and you want that block of code to run
00:44 - no matter what once and then continue
00:46 - looping based on a if a certain value is
00:49 - true now the problem with the do while
00:52 - loops and the do until Loops that we
00:53 - learned is that it may or may not run
00:57 - once so let's say do until num one is
01:00 - equal to 10 well what if num one is
01:04 - already equal to 10 it's not going to
01:05 - loop at all so I'll show you how to make
01:07 - the code run once no matter what so
01:10 - we're going to go ahead and type
01:11 - console. right line and we'll just print
01:16 - normal do until
01:20 - Loop so let's go ahead and create a
01:22 - variable here we'll just call it num
01:25 - one and we'll set that equal to zero and
01:29 - then we'll make our do until Loop so do
01:32 - until num one is equal to 5 and then we
01:36 - can just go ahead and do num one plus
01:41 - equals 1 and then we'll go ahead and
01:43 - print out num
01:49 - one so this is going to start out U
01:52 - printing the number one on here because
01:54 - we called num1 plus equals 1 before we
01:56 - wrote it out on the
01:58 - console so now let's create a do until
02:03 - Loop that will run no matter what one
02:05 - time so let's just give us some space
02:08 - right
02:10 - here now let's go ahead and label this
02:14 - so we'll do console. right
02:16 - line do until
02:21 - variant okay so now let's create our do
02:24 - until so we're going to start off with
02:25 - the keyword do and we're not going to
02:28 - add until at at the top of the loop
02:31 - we're just going to go ahead and hit
02:33 - enter and you can see it fills in Loop
02:34 - for us and we'll just
02:37 - type console. right
02:40 - line num
02:43 - one so let's go ahead and set num one
02:47 - equal to 10 so after this loop after
02:50 - this has looped right here and it's
02:53 - printed out everything and it's done
02:54 - doing that we're just going to go ahead
02:55 - and set num one equal to 10 so we can
02:57 - use it with this do until Loop perod
03:00 - now there's something missing from this
03:02 - we just have do and we just have Loop
03:04 - where are we going to put the until well
03:06 - if we put it down at the
03:09 - bottom then what it's going to do is
03:12 - it's going to do this line right here no
03:14 - matter what and then it's going to Loop
03:16 - until num one is equal to 10 so if it
03:19 - starts out that num one is equal to 10
03:22 - then it it won't matter because it'll do
03:25 - it anyways uh no matter what num one is
03:28 - equal to so if we go ahead and run this
03:31 - program it's going to close out really
03:33 - quick um so let's go ahead new
03:35 - console.readline
03:41 - okay so you can see here that it's got
03:44 - the normal do until Loop which goes 1 2
03:46 - 3 4 5 and then we've got our do until
03:48 - variant and you can see that it prints
03:50 - out 10 here because we added do before
03:54 - the loop
03:55 - until now we can go ahead and do this
03:58 - with a do while loop so we can pretty
04:02 - much
04:03 - just change this to Loop while num one
04:08 - is less than 10 so it's going to do this
04:11 - once it's going to print out 10 and it's
04:13 - going to realize oh num one is greater
04:14 - than 10 so we're not going to go back up
04:16 - here and loop it again so if we run
04:19 - this going to get the normal do until
04:22 - until Loop which prints out one 2 3 4 5
04:24 - and then our do until variant which is
04:26 - going to print out
04:28 - 10
04:30 - so you can go ahead and make a couple
04:33 - practice programs using normal do until
04:35 - Loops um normal do while Loops you can
04:38 - add the while and the until down at the
04:40 - bottom if you want and then once you got
04:42 - that nailed down and you won't forget it
04:45 - go ahead and move on to the next
04:46 - tutorial and thanks for watching guys
