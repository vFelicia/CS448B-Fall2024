00:00 - all right guys your 19th xhtml ncss
00:03 - tutorial and this is going to be a sweet
00:05 - one so what I want to teach you guys
00:07 - first is how to properly align text like
00:11 - Center Justified and you can also make
00:13 - it left Justified which it is by default
00:16 - or make it right Justified so the first
00:18 - thing uh that we need is something that
00:20 - we can Center on our page so just go
00:22 - ahead and make something like um a
00:24 - header 3 header one's just too big I
00:26 - don't like them so make a website let's
00:29 - see what I would have like if I make a
00:30 - Blog so bies blog and uh that looks
00:35 - pretty good so that's what we want the
00:36 - title to be but if we go ahead and save
00:38 - it right now look at this it's on the
00:40 - left hand side of our website and that
00:42 - just looks dumb title should never be on
00:44 - the leftand side what is this like uh
00:46 - you know I don't know I can't think of a
00:49 - I can't think of a good example but I
00:51 - want this title in the middle is what
00:53 - I'm trying to say so in order to do that
00:55 - go ahead and write header three of
00:57 - course and inside your curly brackets
00:59 - the property that we need to change is
01:02 - called text minus or Dash I wonder
01:06 - what's the I wonder what the correct
01:08 - term for that minus sign is if you know
01:10 - leave me a comment so uh I won't mess up
01:12 - in the future tutorials anyways text
01:14 - minus a line and you can either have um
01:18 - there's one of four things you can do
01:20 - left which is by default which you just
01:22 - saw Center which we're going to make
01:25 - this right and I think there's one
01:28 - called Justified now Justified and I
01:30 - never use this one people usually don't
01:32 - but I think it's like what newspapers
01:34 - use where it's left and right Justified
01:37 - so anyways uh play around with that if
01:39 - you want but I want my text centered so
01:41 - let's go ahead and save this and see
01:43 - what we get refresh and check it out our
01:47 - title is now centered perfectly on our
01:49 - web page pretty sweet huh so now that we
01:52 - have a Blog let's go ahead and blog
01:54 - about something so I'm going to go ahead
01:56 - and make a
01:57 - paragraph and I'm just going to write
02:00 - this is the best day ever and let's just
02:04 - go ahead and paste this a bunch because
02:06 - I really want to stress get my point
02:08 - across that this is indeed the best day
02:10 - ever so I'm going to write it like 8,000
02:11 - times so let's go ahead and save this
02:14 - and refresh and it says all right this
02:16 - is looking pretty good but we can't
02:20 - really uh you know this first line
02:22 - doesn't really stand out it would be
02:24 - sweet if we could just indent this right
02:26 - here so you get this brilliant idea to
02:28 - go in here and write space space space
02:31 - space space space space about 15 spaces
02:34 - that looks pretty good so let's go ahead
02:35 - and save this refresh and what the heck
02:38 - what's going on it's not working did we
02:40 - break it no remember that xhtml is wh
02:44 - space insensitive so it takes that white
02:47 - space and pretty much is like yeah I'm
02:49 - just going to ignore that so anytime we
02:51 - want to add an indent on our paragraph
02:54 - which you know you want to do a lot of
02:56 - the time actually you need to add a
02:58 - special property called text indent Now
03:03 - text minus or Dash who knows indent
03:06 - spelled like that and you can either do
03:08 - this as a percentage I believe or what
03:11 - everyone just normally does is they use
03:14 - a certain number number of pixels how
03:16 - many pixels do you want to indent it in
03:19 - order to do that just write the number
03:20 - of pixels and write PX after it so now
03:24 - once we go ahead and save it it's going
03:26 - to go ahead and indent that 25 pixel
03:30 - or again you know you don't have to
03:32 - indent 25 you can indent whatever number
03:34 - you like but that is how you indent text
03:37 - in a paragraph So anyways if you're
03:40 - trying to indent it like this before and
03:42 - it wasn't working that's why because
03:45 - xhtml is just going to ignore your white
03:47 - space and do what it wants so that's how
03:49 - you make paragraphs
03:51 - indented so now that we have time uh
03:54 - let's go over something cool that you
03:56 - guys are probably wondering what to do
03:58 - and I probably should have covered this
03:59 - in like one of the first CSS tutorials
04:01 - but hey we'll cover it now in order to
04:04 - change the overall font or excuse me the
04:07 - overall color of the text as well as the
04:10 - background of the entire web page you
04:13 - need to edit the body element right here
04:16 - so let's go ahead and type body right
04:20 - there because we're pretty much this
04:22 - means affect the whole website so what
04:25 - do we want to do to affect the whole
04:27 - website well the first thing that we
04:29 - wanted do is let's go ahead and change
04:31 - the background color and you know what
04:33 - the uh property for this is well if you
04:36 - guess background minus color you are
04:41 - correct so let make sure I spelled that
04:43 - right background color yep and let's go
04:45 - ahead and change it to something like
04:48 - blue that should look pretty good and
04:50 - after this so now check it out our
04:54 - website is going to appear blue with
04:56 - black text but I mean that's not the
04:58 - easiest stuff to read so if we have a
05:00 - dark blue background it would be a lot
05:02 - easier to read if all this text was
05:03 - white kind of just like that so let's go
05:06 - ahead and do that and in order to make
05:09 - our text white we can do this in one or
05:10 - two different ways we can go ahead and
05:12 - add make our headers white and make our
05:15 - paragraphs white and make everything
05:16 - else white or what we can do is we can
05:19 - just go ahead and add a color white
05:22 - property like this
05:24 - color white property to the body and
05:28 - since everything else is in the body
05:30 - it's going to get affected as well so
05:32 - it's a lot easier than going through
05:34 - each one of your elements and changing
05:36 - it to White just change your overall
05:38 - body to White and that's going to affect
05:40 - anything that's in it so let's go ahead
05:42 - and save that and see what we get nice
05:46 - that is a lot easier to read and this
05:48 - website is looking pretty good mostly
05:51 - because it says Bucky on there and I'm
05:53 - just awesome guy so anyways that is uh
05:56 - how you affect the body background color
05:58 - and the text color and also Center align
06:01 - headers or pretty much Center align
06:03 - anything and also indent paragraphs so I
06:06 - hope you guys enjoyed I'm guessing you
