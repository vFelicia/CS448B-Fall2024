00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in the last video we looked at the
00:08 - jQuery click event handler however in
00:12 - this tutorial we're going to look at the
00:13 - double click event handler now this is
00:16 - going to be triggered when an element is
00:18 - clicked twice with the mouse as you
00:20 - would normally double click on for
00:23 - example an icon on your desktop now the
00:25 - reason I am talking about double click
00:27 - is if you were to create a jQuery
00:32 - website that had for example icons that
00:35 - you might want to double click on for
00:37 - example a simulation of a desktop
00:40 - environment or something
00:41 - you might want to use the double click
00:43 - functionality you might also want to
00:45 - create say an image and say double click
00:48 - on the image to edit it or open it up or
00:51 - retrieve some more information there's a
00:54 - variety of applications this can have
00:57 - however I'm going to be demonstrating it
00:59 - in this tutorial with a link so the
01:02 - first thing we're going to do is we look
01:04 - at the script we've included first of
01:06 - all and we've included obviously jQuery
01:09 - and then we've included this click j/s
01:11 - file as well and this is here and it
01:14 - currently has nothing in it so let's go
01:17 - ahead and create a link I'm going to
01:20 - call this menu and the href is going to
01:25 - be hash and the ID is going to be menu
01:29 - so essentially what I want to happen is
01:32 - when the user double clicks on this link
01:35 - I want a div to appear with some more
01:37 - menu options so let's go ahead and
01:39 - create a div and I'm going to give this
01:43 - an ID of let's just say menu link for
01:48 - this one I've changed the name to menu
01:50 - underscore link and the ID here is going
01:53 - to be menu so inside of here what we can
01:56 - do is create a few more options and
01:59 - obviously this can be tiered so if the
02:01 - user was to for example click on the
02:03 - menu double click on the menu they might
02:05 - have then a list of other options that
02:07 - they can also double click on and you
02:09 - can add all these event handlers to
02:11 - click
02:11 - yes so this is going to be for example
02:16 - programs and settings and log off so we
02:31 - have all of these menu options inside a
02:33 - div now I'm going to again use inline
02:36 - styling which I don't recommend but I
02:38 - don't really have the time to go ahead
02:40 - and create a style sheet so I'm going to
02:42 - give this style of display:none so this
02:48 - menu will be hidden basically okay so
02:51 - let's go ahead and just start this a bit
02:54 - better we're going to use breaks after
02:58 - each link and now this should display
03:02 - just the menu link on the page so now we
03:05 - have the menu link when we click it
03:07 - obviously nothing happens we're going to
03:09 - have jQuery handle this for us so we've
03:12 - got the clicked at Jas file included so
03:14 - now what we can do is use this to
03:17 - reference the double click of the menu
03:19 - link and then to display this menu so
03:21 - let's go over to click j/s and start
03:23 - writing the jQuery code so we're going
03:26 - to use a dollar dollar sign and inside
03:28 - of some brackets the menu the link
03:31 - element we're then going to say instead
03:33 - of dot click we're going to say dot dbl
03:36 - click and then in bracket again we need
03:39 - to include a function that allows us to
03:42 - run a block of code based on this event
03:44 - so function we create out block and a
03:48 - function as we usually would define it
03:50 - but we bring this down so we can start
03:52 - writing our code in here so now once
03:55 - this menu link has been double clicked
03:57 - we want to display the rest of this menu
04:00 - so the div is called menu so we can
04:02 - reference that with hash menu so we use
04:05 - our dollar sign and inside hash menu dot
04:09 - show or we could use another animation
04:13 - effect but we're going to be looking at
04:14 - them a bit later on in the series so
04:17 - essentially now when we double click on
04:18 - this link the menu should show so let's
04:21 - go ahead to our browser and refresh
04:24 - click on it nothing happens if I
04:26 - double-click on it you can see that the
04:28 - menu has been displayed ok so hopefully
04:32 - now you can start to see the
04:34 - functionality behind this and why you
04:37 - might have to use it or my what may want
04:39 - to use it in a more I guess operating
04:43 - system like web application because
04:46 - jQuery is really powerful in this way
04:48 - you could essentially create something
04:50 - that was a bit more you know app had a
04:53 - more application feel to it rather than
04:56 - a web page so the double-click function
04:58 - can be extremely useful when you want to
05:00 - show this kind of functionality
