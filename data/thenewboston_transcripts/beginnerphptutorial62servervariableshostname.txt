00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dork
00:02 - and welcome to another video tutorial
00:04 - created for the new boston now in this
00:07 - video we're going to be continuing with
00:08 - this server environmental information
00:10 - but we're now going to be producing the
00:13 - hosts now this is the hosts of the
00:17 - website is we're going to return is
00:19 - going to be the HTTP colon forward slash
00:21 - forward slash and it's going to be the
00:25 - domain name after that so let's get
00:27 - straight ahead and echo out this dollar
00:30 - underscore server and the information we
00:32 - need to supply it in here is HTTP
00:35 - underscore host now what this is going
00:37 - to do for me is going to is going to
00:40 - output localhost because I'm just
00:42 - running on a local server so let's
00:44 - refresh this and you can see that we've
00:46 - got localhost here now in this video I'm
00:49 - not going to program as much so I'm
00:50 - going to talk about this we're just
00:52 - going to talk about why this might be
00:53 - useful now let's just say we have a
00:56 - template system I might have a variable
01:01 - up here which is called host okay I've
01:06 - got a variable up here called host and
01:08 - this might be contained within say a
01:10 - configuration file so let's get rid of
01:13 - this and we'll create a new file called
01:14 - and we'll call this comp in PHP so what
01:22 - we can do is from our index top here
01:23 - it's pre far we can include or rather
01:26 - require that would probably be better
01:27 - comp in PHP now presuming these are our
01:31 - settings what we've automatically now
01:34 - done is created this variable that's
01:36 - going to automatically update the host
01:38 - that we're running this from so let's
01:40 - say at the moment I've got it on
01:41 - localhost and I'm developing it all my
01:43 - pictures for example for a template
01:45 - system are going to come from localhost
01:47 - forward slash something so it could be
01:50 - local at the moment the URL running
01:51 - under is localhost forward slash series
01:53 - forward slash server so what I could do
01:57 - is I could say host equals this
02:01 - however template or images equals dollar
02:08 - underscore sir no it would be host
02:11 - because we've already defined that host
02:13 - and
02:13 - in a pend forward-slash images for
02:18 - example so we could say that this is our
02:20 - images folder and what we've
02:21 - automatically now done is as long as the
02:23 - directory structures kept the same
02:25 - within our site which it should be if
02:26 - we're developing it the way we want it
02:28 - were automatically updating the host so
02:31 - what I could then do is inside my file I
02:34 - could say echo and I could create an
02:38 - image here source equals that and I
02:42 - could say write what's the location of
02:45 - this so we can append on images so we've
02:49 - created this images variable if you like
02:56 - so we can append on images and then we
02:59 - can put the file name afterwards so I
03:02 - could say another trailing slash on
03:05 - there and we could set images and then
03:07 - header dot gif for example so this is
03:12 - automatically journalists now if we
03:14 - transfer this from local house which I'm
03:16 - running at the moment on a local server
03:18 - - let's say PHP academy' org our
03:21 - configuration files automatically going
03:24 - to update the images folder to PHP
03:26 - academy' org forward slash images so now
03:30 - our page is going to automatically
03:32 - update each directory so we don't have
03:35 - to go through and change them so this is
03:37 - how this the server environmental
03:41 - information with a HTTP host in here
03:44 - helps us with sort of day-to-day easy
03:47 - running of a website and when you're
03:49 - thinking about creating a website with
03:51 - lots of images and you put lots of
03:53 - different pages you should always think
03:54 - about creating a config file with this
03:56 - kind of information in there there are
03:58 - many other ways to do this and many
04:01 - different sort of techniques and methods
04:02 - however as long as you're using
04:05 - something that ensures that each of your
04:07 - folders or wherever you're referencing
04:08 - too often is consistent you can end up
04:11 - with a website or a project that's
04:13 - easily transferable especially if you
04:15 - are creating something that then had to
04:17 - be say released to the public
04:19 - you'd want something that people can
04:20 - just copy straight over to the server
04:22 - and start using more or less
04:23 - straightaway
