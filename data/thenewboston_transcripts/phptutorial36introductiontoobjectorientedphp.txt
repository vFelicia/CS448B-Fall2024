00:00 - what's up guys it is Bucky and welcome
00:02 - to your 36 PHP tutorial and if you've
00:05 - been following my tutorials since the
00:07 - beginning you probably noticed a little
00:09 - small detail and that's that I have not
00:11 - made a new PHP tutorial in literally
00:14 - about two years but this morning I woke
00:17 - up and I was like you know what I feel
00:19 - like making speech be tutorials so
00:21 - that's what I'm doing but I just want to
00:23 - give you guys that warning because that
00:25 - was two years ago and I don't have the
00:27 - best memory so I'm not entirely sure the
00:30 - things we covered in the past um if we
00:32 - were working on any projects then you
00:34 - know you can forget about those because
00:36 - you know it's two years later my memory
00:38 - isn't that great so just want to give
00:40 - you guys a heads up that that was two
00:42 - years ago if there's something that I
00:44 - teach you guys and I'm going over and I
00:46 - didn't cover just leave me a comment and
00:48 - let me know hey you didn't cover this
00:50 - but anyways what we're going to be doing
00:52 - in these tutorials from now on first
00:55 - thing we're going to do blue the first
00:58 - thing we're going to be doing is working
00:59 - with object-oriented PHP that's where
01:02 - we're going to pick up and that's where
01:04 - we're going to go from here so ever
01:06 - saying all right
01:06 - wTF is object-oriented PHP
01:10 - object-oriented PHP is pretty much a
01:12 - different way to program than we were in
01:15 - the last couple tutorials
01:17 - object-oriented PHP has deal with two
01:19 - main concepts and that's classes and
01:23 - objects now what a class is is it's
01:27 - pretty much a way to organize your data
01:30 - all your variables and all functions
01:33 - that are related can go in one class in
01:36 - an object is pretty much a way to access
01:40 - that class to get all the variables and
01:42 - functions from that class and actually
01:45 - be able to use them so for example if
01:47 - you're building a program of all the
01:49 - things in the world you probably make a
01:51 - class for people and probably make a
01:53 - different class for animals and you
01:55 - probably make a different class for
01:57 - places or something now in order to
02:00 - access all those things you need objects
02:02 - and if you create an object you can
02:06 - access all the stuff from the people
02:08 - class let's say and you can create
02:10 - another object to access all the
02:12 - variables and functions from the
02:13 - animals class so you know enough of me
02:15 - talking because you know I'm a
02:16 - programmer not the talker so let's go
02:18 - ahead and start program the first thing
02:21 - I'm going to do is make a simple class
02:23 - and let's just go ahead and use that
02:26 - let's go ahead and make it for people so
02:29 - class let's go ahead and put it right
02:32 - there class people and by the way
02:36 - typically whenever you make classes
02:39 - you're going to want to put them in a
02:40 - separate file but I'm going to throw all
02:43 - mine in the index and this is just for
02:45 - the simplicity of making this tutorial
02:47 - real quick and showing you guys how to
02:50 - make a basic class but anyways
02:51 - if you're like working on it for a
02:53 - company in building these classes you
02:56 - typically want to put each class in a
02:59 - separate file and that's how people
03:00 - typically organize it but anyways like I
03:03 - said in this case everything is going in
03:05 - the index so anyways I have this class
03:08 - called people in order to make class go
03:10 - ahead and type the name class and then
03:12 - go ahead and name your class whatever
03:14 - you want now anything inside your curly
03:16 - braces is going to belong to that class
03:19 - so let's go ahead and make a variable in
03:21 - a function that's part of the pupils
03:24 - class or the people class now the first
03:27 - thing you need to do in order to make a
03:28 - variable which is technically called a
03:31 - field when it's inside a class but I
03:34 - call it variable but I just want to tell
03:37 - you guys that because if you're you know
03:39 - learning this for a class or something
03:41 - not this class but like a college class
03:43 - and the word field was on your multiple
03:46 - choice test choose that instead of
03:48 - variables but this isn't a college
03:50 - course this is the new Boston so I can
03:52 - say whatever the F I want I can't even
03:53 - say F how cool is that
03:55 - so noise go ahead and in order to make a
03:58 - variable or field you first need to type
04:01 - a stupid keyword and that's public now
04:04 - these keywords and they have to deal
04:07 - with something called scope we're going
04:10 - to be covering those in a later tutorial
04:12 - not this toriel because we don't have
04:13 - time but anyways let's go ahead and make
04:15 - a variable called name by the way if you
04:19 - just can't wait public means every thing
04:22 - outside this class has access to this is
04:24 - pretty much basically that but anyways
04:27 - now that we have a variable called name
04:30 - let's go ahead and make another function
04:32 - that can you know set the name like set
04:35 - it to Bucky or Lisa or something like
04:38 - that so let's go ahead and make a
04:39 - function and of course use this go ahead
04:42 - and type that stupid public whatever
04:44 - that means we're going to be covering
04:45 - that in probably the next tutorial and
04:48 - go ahead and make a function just like
04:50 - you did before one name is function set
04:52 - name and pass it in the parameter X and
04:55 - now we want to say this alright we have
04:59 - a variable in this class called name and
05:02 - what we want to do is we want to set it
05:04 - equal to whatever value we pass in so if
05:06 - we pass in Bucky as X we want to set
05:09 - this variable equal to Bucky so how do
05:11 - we say we want to work with this
05:13 - variable I know are we saying just go
05:15 - ahead and type name like that well with
05:18 - classes it's a little bit different in
05:20 - order to access a field in this class or
05:23 - a variable you need to type a special
05:26 - this keyword this means our I'm going to
05:29 - be working with something in this class
05:31 - what am I going to be working with and
05:33 - now you're going to want to make a
05:35 - little arrow and this is another dumb
05:37 - syntax out you have to use but hey now
05:40 - take it up with me take up whoever
05:41 - invented PHP and now once you have this
05:45 - and the dumb little arrow go ahead and
05:47 - type whatever variable name you want to
05:49 - work within that's name and note that
05:51 - whenever you're working with it in this
05:54 - style it doesn't use the dollar sign
05:56 - the only time you got to put the dollar
05:59 - sign is with this and that's it not on
06:02 - the name if you put it on the name
06:04 - you're going to get a error or something
06:05 - weird is going to happen so now that
06:07 - you're working with this variable right
06:09 - here go ahead and set it equal to that x
06:12 - value so check this out we have a class
06:16 - called people that has a variable in it
06:18 - and a function whenever we call this
06:21 - function what it's going to do is if we
06:23 - pass in Bucky 4 it is going to say all
06:25 - right set this variable equal to the
06:29 - name Bucky or you know whatever your
06:31 - name is so anyways let's go ahead and in
06:33 - our body let's go ahead and do that
06:36 - right now
06:37 - actually I don't even know if we're
06:39 - going to have time in this story
06:41 - actually we'll save this for next story
06:44 - because I really hate running time so
06:46 - anyways in the next story where we're
06:48 - going to be doing is I'm gonna upload
06:51 - this to my website and I'm going to show
06:52 - you guys how to create you know what
06:54 - enough of me explaining what I'm going
06:56 - to do in the next door just watch the
06:58 - other tutorial and then you'll know what
06:59 - I'm doing so anyways thank you guys for
07:00 - watching this tutorial and I'll see you
07:02 - next time
