00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky again
00:02 - and welcome to your second physics
00:04 - tutorial now before I even get started
00:06 - in this tutorial telling you guys what
00:07 - I'm even going to be teaching and I want
00:08 - to say this I have a new microphone that
00:11 - I'm using in this tutorial so go back
00:13 - and listen to my last tutorial then
00:15 - listen to this one and whatever you guys
00:17 - vote is the better microphone is the one
00:19 - I'm going to be using for the rest of my
00:21 - tutorial so it's up to you guys to
00:23 - decide on my future of what microphone
00:26 - you guys want to listen to and what
00:27 - microphone I'm going to use so that
00:29 - being said
00:30 - I want to talk to you guys about some
00:32 - alternative or basically different
00:35 - variations of ways we can write
00:36 - scientific notation now the reason I
00:39 - need to teach you guys about these
00:41 - different ways we can write scientific
00:42 - notation is kind of a stupid reason but
00:44 - I'm going try to explain it you know
00:47 - back in high school or maybe you're in
00:48 - high school now different teachers have
00:50 - different requirements for like writing
00:52 - a paper your English teacher might be
00:55 - like all right make sure you write this
00:57 - paper in cursive and your computer
00:59 - teachers like all right make sure you
01:01 - type this paper out on the computer and
01:04 - another teacher is going to be like all
01:05 - right make sure you you know just use
01:08 - basic handwriting when the truth is it's
01:10 - like dude come on does it really matter
01:13 - how I write my paper you can read it any
01:15 - way I write it so why you giving me
01:17 - these stupid rules well that's kind of
01:19 - what I have to teach you now different
01:22 - scientists and different teachers
01:24 - depending you know how they grew up what
01:26 - country they lived in how they practiced
01:28 - physics they they are so anal about
01:32 - writing scientific notation a different
01:34 - way than you probably learned so I'm
01:36 - going to be teaching you all these weird
01:38 - little variations and then no matter
01:40 - what textbook you read no matter what
01:43 - tutorial you're watching you're going to
01:44 - be able to understand what all these
01:46 - little weird symbols mean so the very
01:48 - first thing I want to teach you guys
01:49 - about is something called alternative
01:51 - form now all this means is some
01:56 - scientists are so anal where they make
01:58 - sure the number to the left of the
02:01 - decimal point is zero so you know how we
02:04 - had numbers like one let me go ahead and
02:06 - switch to the right layer we had numbers
02:08 - like
02:10 - 5.26 * 10 4th where they saying all
02:14 - right here's a decimal point right here
02:16 - and this number is not a zero so that is
02:19 - invalid so what they would do is they
02:22 - put a big old line through this and say
02:24 - wrong so what alternative form is is
02:27 - it's basically saying all right the
02:28 - number to the left always has to be zero
02:31 - so you would have something like
02:35 - 0.362 * 10 to 4th that's good
02:41 - 0.8 61 * 10 5th that's good so basically
02:47 - all you have to remember whenever your
02:49 - teacher says make sure you're writing in
02:51 - alternative form make sure that this
02:53 - number is always zero and that's it
02:57 - that's good to go so the next thing I
02:59 - want to talk to you guys about is the
03:00 - multiplication symbol so in our last
03:03 - tutorial I wrote scientific notation
03:06 - like this um let me give you guys a
03:08 - quick example yeah that's probably going
03:10 - to happen a lot so so you guys are
03:12 - probably just going to have to deal with
03:13 - it
03:15 - 5.8
03:17 - oops
03:20 - 5.81 * 10 to the 4th power and again as
03:25 - you can see I use the X for
03:27 - multiplication but some scientists like
03:29 - I said said and some teachers are so
03:31 - anal they make you write a DOT instead
03:34 - of the multiplication sign so it would
03:36 - look like this
03:39 - 5.81 times and your time sign would look
03:42 - like that 10 to the 4th now this thing
03:45 - right
03:48 - here this way of writing it and this way
03:51 - of writing it is the exact same way
03:54 - however some teachers make you write
03:56 - that dot rather than the x and by way in
04:00 - my upcoming tutorials I am never going
04:03 - to write the dot and I'll tell you why
04:05 - whenever you have a number written in
04:06 - scientific notation like
04:09 - 5.81 * 10 4th it can get really
04:13 - confusing
04:15 - sometimes this Dot and this dot
04:17 - especially if you don't move it exactly
04:19 - middle and this one isn't sitting
04:21 - exactly on bottom right there so I mean
04:25 - one dot is enough I don't need two
04:27 - floating all around my numbers so that's
04:29 - why I use use x it's a lot easier than
04:31 - writing a bunch of dots however if your
04:33 - teacher say use a DOT whenever you're
04:35 - showing your work then that's what you
04:37 - got to do now aside from that some other
04:40 - teachers make you use an Asis which just
04:42 - throws a whole another wrench into your
04:44 - problems so you'd have something like
04:47 - 5.81 and then you have to make a stupid
04:50 - Asis like that 10 to the 6 power so
04:54 - again it all depends on you know I
04:57 - needed to go over all these signs
04:59 - because I didn't want you guys to get
05:01 - confused whenever you saw an X and a DOT
05:04 - and an asterisk I didn't want you guys
05:06 - to think that those were all different
05:08 - meanings they all mean the exact same
05:10 - thing it just depends on your preference
05:12 - and your teacher how stupid they are so
05:15 - the last thing I want to talk to you
05:16 - guys about is plain text notation now
05:20 - what plain text notation is is basically
05:22 - this scientists long ago back you know
05:26 - tens and tens of years ago they wanted
05:30 - to send you know scientific notation
05:32 - across emails and they wanted to be able
05:34 - to type it in typewriters well I don't
05:37 - know if you guys ever used the computer
05:38 - before but if you try to do something
05:40 - like this 10 to the 5th there isn't
05:43 - really an easy way you can type that you
05:45 - need to type a whole bunch of like
05:46 - combinations to get exponents to show up
05:49 - whenever you're typing so they made an
05:51 - easier way to do that and that's through
05:53 - the use of plain text notation so plain
05:56 - text notation pretty much means How can
05:59 - I I type scientific notation or write it
06:02 - on a typewriter easily and for that they
06:05 - used no exponents whatsoever so I threw
06:09 - a couple examples up here right now
06:12 - 3.58 E6 is example of plain text
06:16 - notation what this means is
06:21 - 3.58 * 10 to the 6 so it's pretty much e
06:26 - = * 10 well you can obviously see I
06:30 - don't need to explain to you guys what
06:32 - it means so
06:34 - 7.14 e to the8 pretty much means
06:39 - 7.14 * 10
06:42 - to8 so basically that's what it means so
06:47 - it's basically just a way of writing
06:48 - scientific notation that's
06:50 - easily noticeable whenever you're
06:53 - looking at it on a typewriter or email
06:56 - or calculator something like that and
06:58 - this
07:00 - down here is just an alternative version
07:02 - of plain text notation and the reason I
07:05 - wanted to go over these little carrot
07:07 - signs and by the way that's the symbol
07:08 - above the six on your keyboard the
07:11 - reason I want to go over that is because
07:13 - a lot of scientific calculators you use
07:15 - nowadays they you can't like throw an
07:18 - exponent and they can't display it on
07:19 - their screen like this so instead what
07:22 - they do is they type it like
07:25 - this so you see this a lot whenever
07:28 - you're working with calculators because
07:30 - again they have the same problems that
07:32 - computers do it isn't really easy for
07:34 - them to display exponents so they need
07:38 - you know a simple plain text way to
07:41 - display them so that's why we have plain
07:43 - text exponents AKA plain text notation
07:45 - whatever you want to call it so now that
07:48 - I go over excuse me now that I went over
07:50 - all these alternative variations of
07:53 - scientific notation no matter which one
07:56 - of these things you see whether it's PL
07:58 - text notation various multiplication
08:00 - symbols or alternative form where you
08:03 - need the zero to the left of the decimal
08:05 - point you guys should be able to
08:07 - understand what these numbers mean and
08:09 - how to use them and how you can convert
08:11 - them to you know something that you feel
08:13 - more more comfortable working with so
08:16 - with that being said thank you guys for
08:17 - watching don't forget to subscribe and I
08:18 - will see you guys in the next tutorial
