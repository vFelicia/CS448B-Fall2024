00:00 - so now that I can resize you can see
00:01 - that it will snap to each uh grid part
00:05 - so it's uh it looks like it's snapping
00:08 - almost uh let's just go ahead and turn
00:10 - these two
00:14 - off and let's just increase these size
00:16 - to 50 by
00:18 - 5050 okay so you can see that the uh
00:21 - element is now snapping to this grid uh
00:24 - it's a 50x50 grid that it's snapping to
00:27 - um so um it just it will snap in the X
00:31 - and Y AIS now we do have a problem here
00:33 - that we have uh this absolutely tiny now
00:37 - um and you can go ahead and fix that
00:40 - with the uh minimum width and the
00:43 - minimum height option uh which we're
00:45 - going to be taking a look at a bit later
00:48 - now let's just say you had this object
00:50 - and you wanted to only allow resizing
00:53 - with on a particular angle of this so
00:56 - you wanted this to be a handle here and
00:58 - this to be a handle but you didn't want
01:00 - these two here to be handles uh which at
01:02 - the moment can't because they are at the
01:04 - end of the uh document so let's just say
01:07 - I only wanted this right hand side uh to
01:11 - be draggable and I didn't want it to be
01:13 - able to uh resize downwards um we're
01:16 - going to go ahead and look at the handle
01:18 - option now so let's go so it's the
01:22 - handles option and in here you can uh
01:24 - specify a comma separated list of values
01:28 - um all being their uh um Direction so
01:31 - for example you could have n for North e
01:35 - for East s for South and W for West and
01:38 - you can specify these uh comma separated
01:40 - so you can choose uh where you want it
01:43 - to be draggable from so for example if I
01:45 - was just to say East that would be the
01:47 - very right hand side uh here you'll also
01:51 - notice that the uh small resizing
01:53 - triangle has gone as well that's because
01:55 - we've now specified the handles that
01:57 - this can be resized from and can no
01:59 - longer be resized from here so for
02:02 - example if I was to hover over this
02:04 - bottom one you can see that I can no
02:06 - longer resize this here or the corner as
02:09 - well however I can go ahead and resize
02:12 - from the East now if I wanted for
02:14 - example it to be resizable from the East
02:17 - and the southeast which will be this
02:18 - corner here I can go ahead and comma
02:21 - separate SE now this will allow me to
02:24 - separate from the East and the and the
02:27 - southeast as well here so you can see
02:29 - that um the uh Little Triangle is back
02:32 - cuz we can now resize from the corner uh
02:35 - we can resize downwards like this uh
02:37 - however obviously we can't grab it by
02:39 - this Edge so this is a uh comma
02:42 - separated list of values the values that
02:44 - are available to use are obviously north
02:47 - east south and west you could have
02:50 - Northeast South uh sorry Southeast
02:54 - Southwest uh blah blah blah and so on so
02:56 - you can you can Define you know the
02:58 - options that you uh ch choosed now you
03:01 - can
03:02 - also just go ahead and specify all here
03:06 - and what all will do is it will allow it
03:07 - to be dragged from all uh angles again
03:10 - now you'll notice that this time uh
03:12 - instead of not if we didn't include this
03:15 - option for example let's just try that
03:18 - uh you can see that I can't actually
03:19 - drag it from this corner so you can see
03:22 - that I can't actually uh drag from the
03:25 - uh West or the North here so to
03:30 - handle this I guess uh if you'll excuse
03:32 - the pun you can set all here so when we
03:36 - refresh we can actually resize inwards
03:39 - like this and we can resize it anywhere
03:41 - on the page that we like because we've
03:43 - specified uh all handles available so we
03:46 - can do it from all corners and all edges
03:48 - of this uh
03:50 - div so that's the handles which uh is
03:53 - extremely uh powerful um functionality
03:56 - tool or option when it comes to this now
03:59 - let's uh finally take a look at the max
04:02 - um options so the options that we
04:04 - actually have are Max height which we
04:07 - can set a Max height so for example uh
04:10 - at the moment we are at 100 pixels by
04:12 - default so let's say Max 200 sorry not
04:14 - PX and we'll comma separate and say Mac
04:17 - or Min height as well so the minimum
04:21 - height I want it to be is
04:24 - 100 and let's go ahead and specify a Max
04:28 - width and we'll set this to 200 and also
04:31 - a minimum width as well we set this to
04:33 - 100 so essentially what we're doing is
04:35 - we're setting the minimum height and the
04:37 - minimum width to their original values
04:39 - 100 obviously these can be any value uh
04:42 - you want to set them and the maximum
04:44 - height will be 200 so let's go ahead and
04:47 - refresh you can see that when I drag
04:48 - inwards it doesn't work the minimum
04:51 - width uh and the minimum height are now
04:54 - 100 so this won't work dragging it in
04:56 - when I drag it out you can see it will
04:59 - it ends at the 200 PX margin so now that
05:02 - I've specified a minimum uh width and a
05:05 - minimum height uh it's it's constrained
05:07 - to these uh particular this particular
05:10 - region so we've taken a look now at all
05:13 - the options that I felt were useful to
05:15 - practical applications uh there are a
05:18 - variety of other options which you can
05:19 - go and take a look at in the jQuery
05:22 - documentation um there are also events
05:24 - associated with this so for example
05:27 - whilst I'm resizing uh an event could
05:29 - take place so we could um for example as
05:33 - the uh box is being resized or as the
05:35 - element is being resized uh I could go
05:37 - ahead and feedback inside of here or
05:39 - under here the actual size of the box so
05:42 - there's a variety of things you can do
05:44 - with this uh however these are the
05:46 - practical applications uh of uh or the
05:50 - Practical options that you can use uh
05:52 - within this um interaction in jQuery
05:56 - UI so my recommendation would be to go
05:59 - ahead and play around with um things
06:02 - such as as you're resizing maybe going
06:04 - and uh putting the coordinates or the
06:07 - size of the Box inside of this div um
06:11 - while you're resizing it so uh yep
06:13 - that's all the options that I felt
06:15 - necessary uh like I said go and take a
06:17 - look at the events uh and play around
06:20 - with this uh it's an extremely powerful
06:22 - and option filled uh
06:25 - interaction
