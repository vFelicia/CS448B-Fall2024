00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your 60
00:02 - second tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - gonna begin talking about something
00:06 - called exception handling now an
00:08 - exception is a way of handling an error
00:11 - that might occur when your program is
00:13 - running for example if you built a
00:15 - calculator and the users trying to
00:18 - divide by zero that may be an error that
00:21 - occurs when the program is running or if
00:23 - you know you have you made a game and
00:26 - you need a user to register if they try
00:28 - to use like 999 as their age that's
00:31 - unacceptable so that may cause an error
00:34 - to occur so let's go ahead and take a
00:36 - look at the syntax for this now the
00:38 - first thing we need is something called
00:40 - a try block now in this try block this
00:44 - is where we write the code that we want
00:46 - to try it can aid the code that we think
00:48 - error might occur so let's go ahead and
00:51 - make something like I'm gonna be making
00:53 - a simple program that takes two ages the
00:56 - mother's age and the son's age now we
00:59 - all know that a son cannot be older than
01:02 - its mom so whenever the sons age is
01:05 - greater than the mom's age this would of
01:08 - course cause an error so let's go ahead
01:09 - and make two variable int mom's age and
01:13 - int son's actually might as well
01:17 - something equal to values right now and
01:18 - mom's age equals like 30 and it's son's
01:23 - age we'll set this equal to 34 now we
01:26 - all know this is impossible so let's go
01:28 - ahead and test it right now so if the
01:30 - son's age is greater than the mom's age
01:35 - then we want to go ahead and we want to
01:37 - do something called throwing an
01:39 - exception now it's basically this
01:43 - whenever you have something that occurs
01:45 - that shouldn't occur we need to tell the
01:48 - computer that an error did occur and we
01:50 - do this by throwing an exception and in
01:53 - order to throw out an exception
01:54 - exception go ahead and type throw and
01:56 - then type an error number and you can
01:59 - make this any number you want you can
02:01 - actually do other things besides numbers
02:03 - but just throw a number because later on
02:06 - say we made a program that checked for
02:09 - you know 20 different types of errors we
02:11 - want to know what air
02:13 - gah so let's go ahead and we already
02:16 - know that in our little manual 99 means
02:20 - that the mom is younger than the Sun so
02:24 - you know it's pretty much just a
02:25 - reference number so anytime we get an
02:29 - exception and remember anytime this line
02:32 - of code is going to run it basically
02:34 - means that an error occurred so now that
02:37 - we know an error occurred we need a way
02:40 - to handle that err because we just don't
02:43 - want our program to freak out and shut
02:44 - down so in order to handle the air we do
02:48 - something called catch the air catching
02:51 - the air allows you to pass in that
02:53 - number
02:54 - which is 99 so now X is equal to 99 and
02:57 - we can handle it a certain way for
02:59 - example we can just output to the user
03:02 - um something like this son can not be
03:06 - older than mom and then for reference or
03:11 - right err number and this is where we
03:14 - write that's X right there in line and
03:19 - just scroll head so you guys can see
03:21 - what I'm typing so now if you go ahead
03:23 - and run this we can see all right
03:25 - whenever this program runs and the kid
03:29 - is older than the mom then we have a
03:31 - error message that pops up that says son
03:33 - can not be older than mom err number 99
03:36 - so you know this is pretty much just for
03:39 - our reference this error number but
03:41 - let's go ahead and say that the mom was
03:43 - indeed older than a son the mom was like
03:45 - 50 and the son was 54 well this is gonna
03:48 - work fine and this is never gonna happen
03:51 - so no air is gonna be thrown no
03:54 - exceptions are gonna be thrown so this
03:57 - catch block is just gonna be skipped so
03:59 - let's go ahead and run this and we don't
04:02 - get any error messages this program
04:04 - works perfectly so basically the concept
04:07 - of this is our oh is this an exception
04:10 - is a way of handling errors that made it
04:13 - clear when your programs are running for
04:15 - example if the user tries the divide by
04:18 - zero or pretty much if the user does
04:20 - something they aren't supposed to do now
04:22 - in the try block right here this is
04:25 - where you write the code
04:26 - where the air might occur and right
04:30 - after you need a catch block now the
04:32 - catch block is basically what what to do
04:36 - if there is indeed in air and if there
04:39 - is no air in this try block then the
04:41 - catch block is skipped all together and
04:43 - just like a function a catch block takes
04:47 - parameters so it can take an integer in
04:51 - this case such as 99 and that's pretty
04:55 - much just like an error number you know
04:57 - whenever you're just playing on your
04:59 - computer and windows messes up you know
05:02 - how like the error message pops up well
05:04 - that's pretty much what we're doing
05:06 - right here it's like error message to
05:08 - the yada yada yada do you want to send
05:09 - to Microsoft or do you don't want to
05:11 - send by the way does anyone ever send
05:13 - those did they really get those error
05:15 - messages I don't think so but anyways
05:17 - now you guys know the basics of
05:19 - exception handling and by the way if you
05:21 - guys are saying you know what Bucky I
05:23 - could just have used an if statement and
05:26 - you know made a separate function for
05:27 - this well I know that we can do this a
05:30 - different way but exception handling is
05:33 - useful whenever you're trying to you
05:34 - know do computer stuff like allocate
05:36 - memory I just want to show you guys a
05:38 - real easy example for this case but I
05:40 - know that you could have probably made
05:42 - this program just by using a basic if
05:45 - statement and you know maybe a simple
05:47 - function or something but I wanted to
05:49 - demonstrate the try and catch block in
05:51 - how to handle an error message so these
05:55 - are useful for a lot more than you know
05:57 - comparing two variables and there are
06:00 - some instances where we can't just make
06:02 - a simple program that we need to use
06:04 - this exception handling so for now I
06:06 - just want to tell you guys that so I
06:09 - guess in the next tutorial I'm probably
06:11 - going to show you guys another example
06:13 - and show you guys how you can use a
06:15 - different parameter for this catch block
06:17 - right here but for now that's all you
06:19 - guys get so thank you guys for watching
06:20 - don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
06:22 - guys in the next tutorial
