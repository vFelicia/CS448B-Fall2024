00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is another tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston in this lesson we're going to be
00:06 - talking about file uploads now this is
00:08 - really really popular topic because lots
00:10 - of websites now tend to deal with file
00:12 - uploads in one way or another it may be
00:15 - for example uploading an image or
00:18 - uploading a document or even uploading
00:21 - something that needs to be processed at
00:23 - some point so how do we handle file
00:26 - uploads in PHP now it's relatively easy
00:28 - to handle file uploads in PHP and for
00:33 - the purpose of this tutorial if we just
00:36 - open up my browser you can see that I've
00:38 - created an uploads folder here the
00:41 - script that we're currently working with
00:42 - is upload dot PHP and we have a
00:46 - different another directory inside this
00:48 - directory called uploads now the purpose
00:50 - of this tutorial is not to talk about
00:52 - security and file uploads it's just
00:55 - simply how we take a file allow the user
00:58 - to select a file from the computer and
01:01 - then where and then send it to a
01:02 - specific directory as this tutorial
01:05 - stands the code in it it's not safe to
01:08 - use on a web server because in actual
01:10 - fact and the user will be able to upload
01:12 - any file at all for example they could
01:14 - upload a PHP file and they could mess
01:18 - around with with your server and pretty
01:21 - much any way they like
01:22 - as with Exe files things like that
01:25 - executive or files so in this tutorial
01:28 - can be learning how to upload but we're
01:30 - not actually going to be learning how to
01:31 - protect against it there is another
01:32 - tutorial I have in this same file upload
01:36 - series with the security discussion in
01:40 - there and how to secure against your
01:42 - form data so how do we start well we're
01:45 - going to start with a form first of all
01:47 - and we're going to create the form in
01:49 - exactly the same way as usually find so
01:52 - a form action we're going to be going
01:53 - back to upload dot PHP so we're going to
01:55 - be processing the file data inside our
01:58 - tags up here and the method is going to
02:00 - be post remember we're sending a large
02:02 - amount of data so on the method to be
02:04 - post now there is one additional
02:06 - attribute you need to supply in this
02:09 - form
02:10 - and what we need to do is we need to
02:13 - supply the ink type now this is the way
02:16 - that the the data in the form is encoded
02:20 - when it's sent and we need to specify
02:22 - this to be multi-part multi-part and
02:28 - it's for - form and then - and then data
02:31 - so this is basically going to allow us
02:34 - to process the form and enable file
02:40 - uploads and we're sending a large amount
02:41 - of data and this is the encoding type
02:44 - this just tells when we process it tells
02:46 - how we're going to encode the data so
02:50 - now we need to go on to allowing the
02:54 - user to upload a file now you may have
02:56 - come across this before but we use input
02:59 - type type and this is file so this is
03:02 - already created outfit our button our
03:05 - browse button if you like and I'm just
03:07 - going to call the name of this file so
03:10 - let's just break down and we'll create a
03:13 - submit button which is probably
03:15 - important so submit and name your value
03:19 - rather is submit
03:22 - ok so let's refresh our form and see our
03:25 - page and see what we've got
03:27 - ok so we've got an option to choose a
03:29 - file here and a submit button when you
03:31 - do click Submit we're going remember
03:33 - we're submitting back to the upload dot
03:35 - PHP page so if I come up and I click
03:39 - Choose file
03:40 - we're presented with the dial I'm an
03:43 - open file box where we can choose a file
03:45 - type now in this tutorial or in the next
03:48 - tutorial one we did with security we're
03:50 - only going to allow files with the jpg
03:52 - extension to be uploaded so in this case
03:55 - all these pictures here are jpeg files
03:57 - so if I was to click on a file for
03:59 - example the filenames display that's
04:01 - just how my browser displays things
04:02 - might look a little different in other
04:04 - browsers and then I can click Submit now
04:07 - at the moment nothing's happened because
04:09 - we don't have an area inside here or a
04:12 - function inside here that's going to
04:14 - process our fire file upload so we've
04:17 - submitted the file everything's worked
04:19 - but now we need to grab the name of the
04:23 - file the temper
04:24 - relocation of the file in case of
04:27 - comparing file sizes things like that
04:29 - and extensions and will for the
04:33 - extension we need the name but just as
04:35 - an example here I'm going to create a
04:37 - few variables and then show you how to
04:40 - grab the data of the file or different
04:43 - parts of data so we use in this case I'm
04:47 - calling this name this is going to be
04:49 - the file then the file name of the file
04:52 - is uploaded so it's dollar underscore
04:54 - files and then here we put the the name
04:57 - of the variable name so this in this
04:59 - case it's file because it corresponds to
05:01 - what we've put in the form here so
05:03 - that's file and then just like what we
05:05 - use associative arrays because this is
05:07 - stored as an associative array we use
05:11 - brackets next to here and in here we
05:13 - just type name now what this will do is
05:16 - this will show us the file name of the
05:18 - father we've uploaded so hopefully when
05:21 - we click Submit this is here is going to
05:24 - be picked up by this here and then we're
05:26 - going to grab the name which is the file
05:27 - name and then echo out I've just put an
05:29 - echo in front of there so let's give
05:31 - that a try we'll click Choose file I'm
05:33 - going to click this here so this is
05:34 - called words li underscore Nikola
05:36 - underscore one JPEG so if I click Submit
05:39 - above here we've echoed out the name of
05:42 - the file so in actual fact as this page
05:45 - stands at the moment we've gathered data
05:47 - about the file and it's still there for
05:49 - us to use so we can specify a few other
05:53 - as well so let's just delete that echo
05:56 - and another is size so this is going to
05:59 - echo out the the size of the file or
06:01 - store the size of the file so he's
06:04 - exactly the same structure and it's just
06:06 - size in here instead
06:07 - so it's named for name size for size we
06:10 - also have the type of file so we have
06:14 - type and that's dollar underscore files
06:16 - again and that's file because that's our
06:18 - the name of our form field and then we
06:21 - just have type now the temporary
06:23 - location or the temporary name of the
06:26 - file is a bit different and I explain
06:29 - what this is and why we need it
06:32 - basically and this is T TMP underscore
06:35 - name now the temporary now
06:37 - is slightly different to the other
06:39 - attributes in this case what we have
06:42 - here is when we do process the file
06:45 - upload each file is sent to a temporary
06:48 - location on your server so I've just
06:50 - uploaded this file here called Worsley
06:53 - underscore Nicola underscore one dot jpg
06:55 - this has been stored in a temporary
06:57 - location on this has been stored in a
06:59 - temporary location on my server ready
07:02 - for us to process it and put it
07:04 - somewhere relative to where we want it
07:07 - so at the moment we don't actually have
07:10 - anything in file in this uploads folder
07:14 - although we've processed and this file
07:16 - upload
07:17 - we haven't actually moved it yet so bear
07:19 - that in mind this is the temporary
07:21 - location we also have this error error
07:26 - that we can access here so that
07:29 - basically returns an error I think it
07:32 - returns zero if there's no error and but
07:37 - one if there's a there's been an error
07:38 - processing that but we're not really
07:40 - going to look at that and just yet
