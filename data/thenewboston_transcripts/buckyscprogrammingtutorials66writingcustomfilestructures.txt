00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 66th C++
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm gonna
00:04 - be teaching guys how to make a custom
00:06 - file structure to work with your program
00:09 - because whenever you build your own
00:11 - custom program you just don't want to
00:13 - use any file format you know playing
00:16 - off-the-shelf format you want to build a
00:18 - custom file structure so that it makes
00:21 - it easier for your program to work with
00:23 - your files and I know you guys don't
00:24 - know what I'm talking about now but
00:25 - trust me you will by then in this
00:26 - tutorial so the first thing we need is
00:29 - an idea actually before we get started
00:31 - let's go ahead and say that we wanted to
00:33 - make a game like Sim City or whatever
00:35 - where we had a bunch of different
00:37 - players or a bunch of different
00:39 - characters and we wanted to store all
00:41 - the character information and the text
00:43 - file well the first thing we need is of
00:45 - course a text file so go ahead and put
00:47 - of' stream and we'll just name it like
00:50 - the file good enough I guess and we'll
00:54 - just go ahead and create a file called
00:56 - players dot txt now remember if this
01:01 - file already exists then C++ is gonna
01:03 - look at it's going to open that one but
01:05 - if it doesn't exist yet which it doesn't
01:07 - let me go ahead and pull up my directory
01:08 - see no players that text since it
01:11 - doesn't exist already C++ is going to
01:14 - automatically create one once it sees
01:15 - that it indeed does not exist so let's
01:18 - go ahead and the first thing I want to
01:21 - give is we're gonna be making a program
01:23 - basically to enter the character
01:26 - information you know say we wanted to
01:28 - build a bunch of characters ourselves
01:30 - well let's go ahead and give the user an
01:31 - ISO prompt about what we want them to do
01:33 - so see out not mmm
01:36 - close but you know not close we'll just
01:39 - go ahead and put enters enter players ID
01:44 - you know maybe they have a name for each
01:47 - player and maybe they have like a bank
01:50 - account money or something simple enough
01:52 - and then go ahead and end that line so
01:55 - this is just gonna print some text out
01:57 - on the screen telling them what to do
01:58 - so we're gonna enter a number a name and
02:00 - another number the first one's going to
02:02 - be the ID number the second one's gonna
02:04 - be their man like Bucky and third one's
02:06 - gonna be like $48 in their bank account
02:08 - so I'm stupid like that and now what we
02:11 - wanted to do is we're gonna be working
02:12 - with something called an end-of-file
02:14 - marker now before I go on let me say
02:17 - this every file on your computer when
02:20 - C++ opens its gonna look for the end of
02:23 - file marker this is pretty much the end
02:26 - of your file it's I mean no weird
02:28 - complicated explanation it's just a
02:30 - little symbol that goes at to enter your
02:32 - file to tell C++ you know how long your
02:34 - file is whenever it's reading your file
02:36 - and it gets that end the file marker
02:38 - that's where he knows where to stop it's
02:40 - pretty much telling C++ where the end of
02:42 - your file is simple as that now what we
02:45 - can do is we can explicitly enter and
02:48 - end a file indicator and I'll show you
02:50 - guys how to do this later on but
02:52 - basically whenever you hit control hold
02:55 - down control and his Z on your keyboard
02:56 - if you're working with Windows this
02:59 - inputs and end the file marker and I
03:01 - know it's kind of a weird way to do
03:03 - things because if there was an end of
03:05 - file marker button on your keyboard it
03:06 - would be a lot easier to see but if
03:08 - you're working with Windows then hold
03:09 - down control in his E and this puts the
03:12 - end of file marker and so we'll just go
03:14 - ahead and they probably don't know that
03:16 - so we'll just go ahead and put press
03:18 - ctrl + Z to quit the program and you
03:24 - know stop inserting characters or
03:27 - whatever so go ahead and in that line I
03:29 - know that's a little weird but we need
03:31 - it or this program would just keep
03:33 - running forever so now we need three
03:35 - variables that are temporarily going to
03:37 - store this information just go ahead
03:38 - we'll make the ID number an integer
03:43 - and we'll make the name a string of
03:48 - course and we'll put the money since it
03:51 - has decimal points like four to eight
03:54 - dollars and 87 cents we'll go ahead and
03:56 - make a double so we have three variables
03:59 - ID number name and money now what we
04:03 - need to do is we the user want to be
04:07 - allowed to enter this information
04:08 - whenever this program is running so
04:10 - let's go ahead and make a while loop
04:12 - because we really don't know how many
04:14 - characters the user is going to enter
04:16 - and here's what we do remember any time
04:19 - you want to get information from the
04:20 - keyboard
04:21 - aka from the user you use CIN and then
04:24 - the first thing they type in is going to
04:27 - be stored in the variable ID number the
04:30 - second thing they type in is going to be
04:32 - the character's name and the third thing
04:34 - they type in is how much money the
04:36 - character has so the user is going to be
04:39 - able to type characters information you
04:41 - know maybe five different character
04:43 - informations and then we want to be able
04:45 - to store in a file so this basically the
04:50 - user is going to be able to type in as
04:51 - many characters as they want so this
04:54 - loop is going to be true as long as they
04:57 - don't get to the end of the file and how
04:59 - do you know you get to the end of file
05:00 - because of this weird control-z thing so
05:03 - basically whenever the user enters
05:06 - information we now have an ID number
05:08 - unnamed
05:10 - in some amount of money so now the only
05:12 - thing we want to do is we want to insert
05:14 - it into the file so of course remember
05:17 - just like before in the last Oriels we
05:19 - write the file object and this is pretty
05:21 - much a synonym for players text so they
05:24 - can be used interchangeable they can't
05:26 - be used interchangeably but whenever
05:28 - you're looking at it just assume that
05:31 - this means player is a text so anything
05:33 - we insert it just gets directly inserted
05:36 - into the file players out text because
05:38 - that's the file associated with object
05:41 - right here so the first thing we want to
05:42 - insert is the ID number and then just so
05:46 - it looks nice and pretty just go ahead
05:48 - and insert a little space
05:50 - and then the next thing what did we have
05:53 - a name and then a little space after
05:58 - that and then the last thing is money
06:01 - and line and let me make sure I got
06:05 - number space namespace money and line
06:08 - okay so it's good go
06:09 - so basically well let's go ahead and run
06:11 - this program and see what we get
06:13 - it says re-enter player's ID name and
06:18 - money so let's go ahead and make a
06:20 - couple players for this you know Sim
06:22 - City social community game whatever the
06:25 - heck game were making so the players ID
06:28 - is gonna be like 1 and the player's name
06:30 - is gonna be like Bucky and the money I
06:34 - have is like 65 dollars and 47 cents go
06:37 - ahead and press Enter add another
06:39 - character
06:40 - the ID is 2 the name is Sara and she has
06:44 - 43 dollars and 21 cents and let's make
06:48 - one more 3 is Sofie and she has two
06:53 - dollars and fifty four cents now let's
06:55 - go ahead and press well we can just go
06:58 - ahead and press ctrl-z right now and
07:00 - sometimes you have to press ENTER and
07:02 - then your program is going to stop
07:03 - sometimes you can just hit control Z and
07:05 - it send a file sometimes you need hit
07:07 - control Z enter so anyways I hit control
07:10 - Z that signified the end of the file and
07:13 - of course when I got to the end of my
07:15 - file I couldn't insert anything else so
07:17 - my program quit as you can see right
07:20 - here so now if you go up to your
07:23 - documents you can see that you have a
07:24 - text file created called players text so
07:27 - let's go ahead and click that and you
07:28 - can see at the well basically it
07:31 - inputted exactly as we input it does
07:35 - that make sense
07:35 - no well too bad you can see that it
07:39 - wrote to the file exactly what we wanted
07:41 - to exactly in the format that we wanted
07:43 - to so basically what was going on is
07:46 - this we first created a file that we
07:49 - opened and whenever we open it we have
07:51 - access to that file we then gave the
07:54 - user a nice little prompt showed them
07:56 - how to input the data and I mean
07:58 - made three variables so we could
08:00 - temporarily store the data now the user
08:03 - was allowed to fill in the variables ID
08:06 - number name and money and whenever we
08:10 - had those variables populated with
08:12 - values we just stored him in a file
08:14 - using whatever format we wanted to in
08:17 - the format we wanted to store min was
08:19 - the ID number space name space money and
08:24 - then once you got one character or one
08:26 - player inserted just go to the next line
08:28 - and do it again so that way on the next
08:31 - line
08:31 - it was ID number name money on the next
08:35 - line ID number name money so that is how
08:38 - you can have you know a way of storing
08:41 - data into a file formatted how you want
08:45 - it so you're saying all right why would
08:48 - I want to format it like this well maybe
08:50 - you wouldn't but whenever you know the
08:53 - structure of how your file is formatted
08:55 - that way whenever we open the file to
08:58 - read all the information in we know what
09:01 - format it's gonna be and so that's why
09:03 - you want to create custom file
09:04 - structures because custom file
09:06 - structures make it easier for your
09:08 - program to work with files if they know
09:10 - where the data is going to be and also
09:12 - what type of data is gonna be there for
09:14 - example in our game we knew that that
09:17 - first row was always ID numbers that
09:19 - second row was always names in that
09:21 - third row was always and by the way row
09:25 - I mean column that third column was
09:27 - always the amount of money so I mean it
09:29 - just makes it really easy to program
09:31 - this way so that's all I have for you
09:33 - guys for this tutorial I know this was
09:35 - kind of weird with this control-z thing
09:37 - I probably should have made it without
09:38 - it but hey you guys learned something
09:40 - new I guess so thank you guys for
09:41 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
09:43 - I'll see you guys in the next video
