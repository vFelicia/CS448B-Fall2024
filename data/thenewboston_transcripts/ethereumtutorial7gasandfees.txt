00:00 - alrighty y'all welcome back to another
00:01 - tutorial and in this one we are going to
00:04 - be talking about gas
00:06 - now i'd like to start things out by
00:08 - telling you a story and that is the
00:10 - story of whenever i first started
00:12 - developing on the ethereum network
00:15 - so this is me right here uh this is back
00:18 - in the days when i was gray and i had no
00:20 - face so either way i opened my laptop
00:23 - and learned some ethereum decided to
00:25 - connect to one of these nodes
00:28 - and i'm like okay i know how this works
00:30 - i'm just going to write a smart contract
00:32 - i'm going to deploy it to the network
00:34 - and then let me just tell this node hey
00:36 - can you go ahead and run this
00:38 - and the node responded to me and
00:41 - cannot run i need gas and i'm like
00:45 - okay well i got gas then nude was like
00:48 - not that kind of gas talking about
00:50 - ethereum gas
00:51 - and i'm like okay this is weird so
00:54 - so you're telling me that in order to
00:56 - run this that you need something called
00:59 - gas
01:00 - and with gas you will then be able to
01:02 - process these transactions and it's like
01:06 - yup and i'm like wait a minute am i
01:08 - talking to an ethereum node right now
01:10 - what's going on so either way i decided
01:12 - to do a little bit more research online
01:15 - so the very first thing that i learned
01:17 - is that when measuring gas it's
01:19 - typically measured in guay rather than
01:22 - whey or ether and just as a reminder one
01:25 - gray is equal to one billion whey
01:29 - so back to this gas situation here
01:32 - now i know at the beginning of the
01:33 - tutorial what i said is that in simple
01:35 - terms gas is really just the fee
01:37 - required to send transactions on the
01:39 - ethereum network
01:40 - now more technically
01:42 - gas
01:44 - is the unit that allows us to measure
01:46 - the amount of work
01:47 - required to execute some code on the
01:49 - ethereum network
01:51 - alright so what the heck do i mean by
01:52 - that what i mean is this
01:55 - whenever
01:56 - you are trying to execute some let's say
01:58 - smart contract on the ethereum network
02:00 - not all smart contracts require the same
02:02 - amount of work and energy from these
02:04 - nodes
02:05 - for example
02:06 - let's say that you had a very simple
02:08 - smart contract and all it did was like
02:10 - add two numbers together maybe that
02:12 - would take let's say one guess now let's
02:14 - say you had another smart contract and
02:17 - you're making this you know your own
02:19 - multi-sig wallet with nfts and i don't
02:22 - know whatever you want to put in a smart
02:23 - contract but it took a long time to
02:26 - actually process all all this logic so
02:28 - in that case
02:29 - maybe that smart contract would require
02:32 - three gas
02:34 - so we see somehow that the complexity
02:37 - and the amount of effort and energy it
02:39 - takes to run these smart contracts is
02:41 - somehow related to the quantity of gas
02:44 - that we need however we still didn't
02:46 - talk about what the heck gas is and on
02:48 - top of that how the heck do we even
02:50 - calculate how much gas is required to
02:52 - run these smart contracts so it turns
02:55 - out that in ethereum every single
02:58 - operation that gets ran on a smart
02:59 - contract basically anything that you can
03:01 - do in a smart contract has a related
03:05 - cost
03:06 - now
03:07 - i'm sure the url might change over time
03:08 - but if you type in something like
03:10 - opcodes for the evm or opcodes for
03:12 - ethereum you're going to find a list of
03:14 - the current prices and let me scroll
03:16 - down and show you what's going on here
03:19 - so we'll get to the details of this in a
03:21 - minute but just check this out for the
03:23 - time being
03:24 - so the name is essentially the name of
03:26 - these operations
03:28 - and gas
03:30 - this column right here is essentially
03:32 - the gas cost of these operations
03:35 - all right so let's figure out what the
03:37 - heck this means like add
03:38 - three gas
03:40 - uh multiply that looks like it takes
03:42 - five gas
03:43 - so what does this all mean so what this
03:45 - means
03:46 - is that later on whenever we start
03:48 - actually writing smart contracts and by
03:50 - that i mean actually writing the code
03:52 - for them typing on our keyboard
03:53 - every single operation that we can
03:56 - include in our code it has a cost for
03:58 - example whenever we have two numbers and
04:01 - we want to just add those together it's
04:03 - going to require three gas so this is
04:06 - just example code that we're going to
04:07 - see in our smart contract this is the
04:09 - name of the operation and this is the
04:12 - related gas cost so again that
04:14 - translates to this name and this gas
04:17 - cost over here
04:18 - and just another example just so you
04:20 - know we had two different ones for
04:22 - multiplication this is what it's going
04:24 - to look like in our actual source code
04:26 - and of course this operation this little
04:28 - asterisk right here if you're uh
04:30 - familiar with programming then that
04:32 - means multiplication
04:34 - and the cost for this is five gas all
04:36 - right so this is starting to make sense
04:38 - the more complex your smart contract is
04:40 - the more operations it has
04:42 - and each operation is going to require
04:45 - more gas
04:47 - but now we still have the question of
04:49 - well what is the price of each one of
04:52 - these gas i mean is it one way is it a
04:55 - hundred gray
04:56 - so we know that if we had
04:59 - a contract with just these two
05:00 - operations in it for example that it
05:02 - would require a total of eight gas but
05:05 - is that like
05:06 - um a fraction of an ether is that like
05:08 - 20 ether like what is that
05:11 - so check this out
05:12 - unlike purchasing something in real life
05:14 - that already has a price tag stuck to it
05:17 - in the ethereum network users actually
05:20 - specify their own gas price when sending
05:23 - transactions
05:24 - now
05:25 - this price that they specify it
05:27 - represents the price per unit of gas
05:30 - that the user is willing to pay now
05:33 - miners can choose whether it's worth it
05:36 - for them to accept this transaction
05:38 - so in this sense
05:40 - try to think of gas not so much as
05:42 - something with a fixed price but more
05:44 - like a bidding system now sticking with
05:46 - our gas theme
05:48 - it's kind of the equivalent of going to
05:50 - a gas station and saying hmm
05:52 - i'll offer you 5 cents a gallon for this
05:55 - gas in that case the gas station owner
05:58 - is just going to pretty much ignore you
05:59 - or laugh at you now if you go to the
06:01 - same gas station and say
06:03 - i'll offer you
06:05 - 28 dollars per gallon of gas
06:07 - then the gas station owner is gonna
06:10 - you know even if they're serving a
06:11 - customer they're going to push them out
06:12 - of the way okay okay whatever you need
06:14 - so that is pretty much what's going on
06:16 - in the ethereum network where people are
06:18 - essentially going to bid to get their
06:20 - transactions processed and the miners
06:23 - are pretty much going to prioritize
06:25 - those by who's ever bidding the highest
06:27 - amount now the average price of gas is
06:30 - actually determined by the overall
06:31 - demand for the network resources and a
06:34 - very cool resource that i use quite
06:36 - often is etherscan.io
06:38 - gas tracker if ever you just want to
06:40 - know the current price of gas then you
06:42 - can go here and it'll tell you right now
06:45 - it's hovering right around 145 gway oh
06:48 - hopped up to 162. look at that
06:50 - now in addition to gas price we also
06:52 - need to talk about gas limit
06:55 - so whenever you send a transaction on
06:57 - the ethereum network what you're going
06:58 - to do is you're going to both specify
07:00 - the gas price which we just talked about
07:02 - and this field called gas limit so gas
07:05 - limit is the maximum units of gas that
07:08 - you're willing to spend on the
07:10 - transaction now another thing that i
07:12 - want to mention is that when executing a
07:14 - transaction
07:15 - nodes are going to keep track of the gas
07:17 - being used compared to the total amount
07:20 - of gas that you said is allowed
07:22 - so
07:23 - if execution cost ever exceeds the
07:25 - amount that you specified is basically
07:28 - the maximum amount allowed then
07:30 - execution is just going to stop in other
07:32 - words the notes are just going to stop
07:33 - processing that transaction now there's
07:36 - another thing that i want to point out
07:38 - and this is something that may confuse
07:40 - you if you're looking at examples of you
07:43 - know calculating this online and that is
07:46 - there was something called a london
07:48 - upgrade in the ethereum network and as
07:50 - part of this upgrade it actually changed
07:53 - the way that these gas fees are
07:55 - calculated so i just want to point this
07:57 - out we're going to be taking a look at
07:59 - how they were calculated pre-london and
08:01 - also post london
08:02 - but
08:03 - again i want to mention this because if
08:05 - you're looking you know maybe you forgot
08:07 - this video and you want to go back and
08:09 - look for a reference of how these things
08:10 - are calculated if you're seeing two
08:12 - different formulas and you know your
08:15 - head's blown up about why is there two
08:16 - different formulas it's likely because
08:18 - one was pre-london and one was
08:20 - post-london
08:21 - so anyways let's get into this example
08:23 - and again this one right here we are
08:25 - covering pre-london
08:27 - however
08:28 - is useful to cover anyway so
08:31 - the max gas fee
08:33 - in other words the maximum amount you're
08:35 - willing to pay for the entire
08:36 - transaction is equal to the price of gas
08:40 - again this is something that you
08:42 - specified how much do you think
08:44 - is needed to
08:45 - more or less convince that gas station
08:48 - operator
08:49 - and then the gas limit is how many of
08:52 - these gas units you're willing to spend
08:55 - so just to hammer this down
08:57 - we will say that
08:59 - if you set a gas price of 100 gway
09:03 - and you specified a gas limit of 8 units
09:06 - of gas then this would equal
09:09 - a maximum gas fee of 800 gray
09:13 - now
09:14 - i say maximum rather than just the you
09:17 - know hard-coded
09:18 - gas fee because if this transaction
09:21 - let's say that you specified it for this
09:23 - actually
09:24 - let's say that a node was processing
09:26 - this transaction and after running the
09:28 - entire logic in the smart contract it
09:31 - realized that you know what um it
09:33 - actually only costs 600 gwei that 200
09:37 - additional guy is not just something
09:39 - that you overpay it's actually returned
09:41 - to you as the user so again just want to
09:43 - hammer down this is the maximum gas fee
09:46 - for the transaction
09:47 - but it's often higher than the actual
09:49 - gas fee now starting with the london
09:51 - network upgrade every block has a base
09:54 - fee and this base fee is the minimum
09:57 - price per unit of gas for inclusion in
10:00 - the block and this base fee by the way
10:02 - it's automatically calculated by the
10:05 - network it's not something that the user
10:06 - specifies themselves so whenever you see
10:09 - base fee you can just think the minimum
10:11 - gas price and by the way another fun
10:14 - fact is that whenever a block is mined
10:17 - this base fee is actually burned in
10:20 - other words this amount of ether is
10:22 - actually removed from circulation so
10:25 - with this base fee there's actually no
10:27 - more of going to that gas station in air
10:29 - quotes and saying hmm i'm going to offer
10:31 - you 5 cents a gallon since there's
10:33 - always a fair minimum gas price now on
10:36 - top of the base fee users are also
10:38 - expected to set a tip and you may often
10:41 - see this as priority fee sometimes but
10:44 - whether you call it a tip or a priority
10:46 - fee it's the same thing so what is this
10:48 - tip well if you go online it's going to
10:50 - say that the tip compensates miners for
10:52 - executing and propagating user
10:54 - transactions and blocks and is expected
10:56 - to be set automatically by most wallets
10:59 - now what that means is it's pretty much
11:01 - just a bribe to miners in other words
11:04 - miners are going to prioritize the
11:06 - transactions with the highest priority
11:08 - fees or in other words bribes ahead of
11:11 - all the other ones
11:12 - and they're going to do this because
11:14 - this fee right here remember this
11:16 - doesn't go to the miners this actually
11:17 - gets burnt or
11:19 - this ether is removed from circulation
11:21 - so the miners are going to be able to
11:23 - keep this tip right here
11:25 - so of course what they're going to do is
11:27 - as transactions come in they're pretty
11:29 - much gonna sort them by highest tip to
11:30 - lowest and the ones who bribe the miners
11:34 - the most pretty much get their
11:35 - transactions processed faster than the
11:37 - others now to calculate the total
11:39 - transaction fee you take both of these
11:42 - and you add them together and then you
11:44 - multiply it by the gas limit now this
11:47 - gas limit is just identical to before
11:49 - it's just the limit that the user sets
11:51 - so again just to wrap everything
11:53 - together total transaction fee is equal
11:55 - to the sum of the base fee plus the tip
11:58 - multiplied by the gas limit now the last
12:01 - thing that i want to cover is this idea
12:03 - of max fee per gas so what the heck is
12:06 - this max fee per gas because i mean
12:08 - things couldn't get any more complicated
12:10 - right well check it out it's actually
12:12 - not that bad and it makes a lot of sense
12:13 - uh once you learn about it so max feed
12:15 - for gas is the absolute maximum that
12:18 - you're willing to pay per unit of gas to
12:21 - get your transaction included in a block
12:24 - now
12:25 - under most circumstances the actual fee
12:28 - that you end up paying is actually going
12:29 - to be less than the max fee per gas
12:32 - alright so it seems like this system was
12:34 - working all right before so why would we
12:36 - ever want to include a max fee per gas
12:39 - so imagine this scenario imagine that
12:41 - you sent a transaction up to the network
12:43 - and the current base fee was would you
12:46 - say one one way
12:48 - so you added one away here maybe you
12:50 - added whatever for a tip and you sent it
12:52 - up now immediately after sending that
12:55 - transaction to the network what the
12:57 - network did is it recalculated the base
12:59 - fee so it's now two-way
13:02 - so now you have a transaction up there
13:04 - floating around the network which is
13:06 - pretty much incorrectly funded
13:08 - so what's going to happen to it i mean
13:10 - is it going to get
13:12 - dropped or is it going to fail or is it
13:14 - going to become stuck is the base fee
13:16 - going to go back down and then it gets
13:18 - processed i mean
13:20 - there's a lot of unpredictability here
13:22 - so that is why this max fee per gas was
13:25 - introduced so essentially for a more
13:28 - predictable transaction settlement it's
13:30 - typically considered best practice to
13:32 - set a max fee to pretty much anticipate
13:36 - the possibility of an increasing base
13:38 - fee now just like in the last example
13:41 - the difference between the max fee per
13:43 - gas and the actual fee is refunded back
13:46 - to the user so the user doesn't need to
13:48 - worry about overpaying beyond the base
13:51 - fee whenever their transactions are
13:52 - executed
13:53 - so just break this down by max fee per
13:56 - gas it's pretty much saying this is the
13:58 - maximum i'm willing to pay
14:01 - now the actual fee
14:03 - is what you end up paying and it's
14:05 - usually less than this so the refund
14:07 - amount is basically pretty simple math
14:10 - uh the maximum you are willing to pay
14:13 - minus the actual fee and that's the
14:16 - amount that gets refunded back to the
14:17 - user and on that note i believe that's
14:19 - all we need to cover on the topic of gas
14:21 - and fees and by all we mean to cover
14:26 - kind of laughing when i say that because
14:27 - i know i just talked a ton of
14:29 - information in all your heads but uh
14:31 - yeah i think that covers gas and fees so
14:34 - thank you for watching don't forget to
14:35 - subscribe and i will see y'all later
