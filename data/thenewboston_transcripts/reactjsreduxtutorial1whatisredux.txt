00:00 - what is going on ladies and gentlemen
00:03 - welcome back to another fantastic
00:04 - tutorial series my name is Bucky Roberts
00:07 - and in this course I am going to be
00:09 - teaching you guys how to use react with
00:12 - Redux now before I go any further I just
00:15 - want to mention this in order to
00:17 - understand what the heck is going on in
00:19 - this video series you first have needed
00:22 - to watch reactjs tutorials for beginners
00:26 - this is my very first intro to react
00:28 - series and in this series I teach all
00:31 - the basics of react what it is what it's
00:33 - used for all the fundamentals so once
00:37 - you watch this tutorial series you are
00:38 - ready to move on to this one so this one
00:41 - is kind of part two in a way so like I
00:45 - said this one is going to be covering
00:46 - react and Redux now before I get into
00:50 - what the heck Redux is and why we need
00:53 - to use it I first need to talk about a
00:56 - little problem that we have whenever we
00:58 - try to develop a single page
01:01 - application so that's kind of what react
01:04 - is it's a library for making single page
01:06 - applications now this website right here
01:09 - it isn't one this is just my website the
01:11 - new boson.com but say that I was
01:14 - thinking about making this a single page
01:16 - application so all right I need to kind
01:19 - of start planning everything in my head
01:21 - so let me just talk you guys through
01:23 - this so I know that whenever we use
01:25 - react the different parts of your
01:27 - website are pretty much just called
01:29 - components and and each component has a
01:31 - little piece of memory with it and we
01:34 - just call that state so this playlist on
01:37 - the left I could probably make that a
01:39 - component and then this video player
01:41 - right here could definitely make that a
01:43 - component um maybe this progress bar and
01:46 - these buttons that could be one and
01:48 - maybe this little input form right here
01:51 - that could be a component and all of
01:53 - these different components they each
01:55 - would have their own State their own
01:58 - little chunk of memory to manage for
02:01 - example what videos to display um how
02:04 - far the progress bar was you know blue
02:07 - and how far it was gray and maybe this
02:09 - form needed some state to remember what
02:13 - user was posting what question so
02:16 - basically if I'm trying to plan this in
02:18 - my head I'm thinking of all the things
02:20 - that can go wrong and all the things I
02:22 - need to take care of already I mean the
02:23 - user they're going to be doing a bunch
02:25 - of stuff they're going to be clicking
02:27 - buttons they're going to be favoriting
02:29 - videos they're going to be asking
02:31 - questions right here and then of course
02:34 - I have to manage all my States I need to
02:36 - have a state or an object to you know
02:39 - keep track of all the videos and then
02:41 - another one for the active video and
02:43 - then another one for the progress and
02:46 - then okay there's just a bunch of stuff
02:48 - a bunch of different parts I have to
02:49 - make and on top of everything on top of
02:53 - everything once that's all done I need
02:55 - to figure out how everything's connected
02:58 - how everything communicates with one
02:59 - another how whenever you click an item
03:02 - in this list it displays a video right
03:04 - here and you know what I decided that
03:07 - this is just way too overwhelming I
03:09 - can't deal with this I'm just going to
03:10 - go watch Orange is the New Black for 16
03:12 - hours like you usually do and you know
03:14 - what I'm done programming I I can't
03:17 - handle this well what if I told you guys
03:20 - that there was actually an easy way to
03:23 - set all of this up that no matter how
03:26 - big your software project was no matter
03:28 - how many different pieces you had
03:30 - involved that you could actually
03:32 - architect this or set it up in a way
03:34 - that you can manage everything easily so
03:37 - even though you may have a bunch of
03:39 - different components and they are all
03:41 - communicating with one another and
03:43 - connected in these weird kind of ways
03:45 - that you can actually set this up to
03:47 - manage everything
03:49 - beautifully well ladies and gentlemen
03:51 - that is what this tutorial series is
03:53 - about and that thing is called Redux so
03:57 - what I want to do now is I kind of want
03:59 - to give you guys a really brief overview
04:01 - of Redux and talk to you guys about all
04:03 - the different pieces and by all the
04:06 - different pieces I mean like there's
04:08 - just like seven different pieces so it's
04:10 - going to take like 3 minutes but at
04:13 - first if you guys are like you know what
04:15 - this is just it just looks like a overly
04:17 - complex way to manage your piece of
04:19 - software well this is the cool thing
04:23 - even though it may seem kind of
04:24 - confusing at first the thing is like I
04:27 - said no matter how many pieces you
04:29 - decide to add to your application later
04:31 - on no matter how complex you think your
04:33 - software is going to be it all still
04:36 - fits in the same architecture so at
04:39 - first it may look a little overwhelming
04:42 - but this is as complex as it gets no
04:45 - matter how big your app is this is all
04:48 - there is to it so with that being said
04:51 - let's go ahead and get started
