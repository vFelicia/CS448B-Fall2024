00:00 - hello youtube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:05 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:07 - gonna be working more on the car
00:08 - tutorial
00:09 - now this isn't familiar then go ahead
00:10 - and move on to the beginning of the car
00:13 - tutorials so let's go and get started if
00:16 - you remember we created a public
00:20 - variable called car name as a string now
00:22 - we're gonna go ahead and do this for
00:23 - each of the text field text fields so
00:28 - we'll just type public car color as a
00:35 - string it looks like I forgot to rename
00:38 - text box one but it's actually the color
00:41 - of the car so we'll just type car color
00:44 - equals text box one dot text so whatever
00:51 - the change the text is going to update
00:53 - our car color variable so we can go
00:55 - ahead and get these out of the way
00:57 - because we're not using them okay so now
01:01 - whenever the we'll come over here to new
01:06 - murders and whenever the value has
01:08 - changed we want to store that value and
01:11 - update it in the code so we'll create an
01:14 - integer value so public
01:18 - car doors as integer so whenever they
01:23 - change the value of the numeric picker
01:26 - doors we're gonna go ahead and set car
01:29 - doors it's going to be equal to new
01:35 - murders dot and now we are going to
01:39 - access the value and if you read the
01:46 - description says gifts are set the value
01:48 - assigned to the spin box so when you're
01:52 - using the equals so it's gonna be well
01:55 - this is on the right side of the equals
01:56 - so it's gonna be getting if we had new
01:59 - murders start value equals car doors
02:01 - we'd be calling set so car doors is
02:03 - gonna be set to the value of new murders
02:06 - go ahead and
02:09 - make some room there and let's do that
02:11 - again for the horsepower so we'll just
02:16 - go ahead we'll make the horsepower this
02:18 - string I have a string type so they can
02:21 - type whatever they want there and we're
02:22 - not gonna get any errors because it's
02:24 - trying to convert that to an integer so
02:27 - Otis type public car horse as string and
02:32 - whenever they update the horsepower
02:33 - we'll just type car horse equals text
02:41 - horse dot text so now that we've stored
02:46 - all of the values we're gonna need to
02:48 - know let's go back into our form 1vv
02:52 - code and so we're gonna use with new car
02:55 - 1 new car one car name is going to be
02:58 - equal to you can see we've got new car
03:01 - right here so we're just gonna type add
03:03 - new car which is the object of new car
03:06 - and we're gonna get to cover the public
03:08 - variable car name and now we're going to
03:13 - access the color we'll set that equal to
03:15 - add new car dot let's see car color and
03:26 - then we're going to need to do the
03:30 - number of doors and the horsepower so
03:33 - dot horsepower and we'll set that equal
03:36 - to add a new car dot and we're going to
03:42 - add we're gonna do a car horse and then
03:45 - we'll do it with the number of doors
03:46 - well so then equal to add new car dot
03:51 - car doors so we set the values that
03:56 - we're gonna need for our new car one now
03:59 - there's an easier way to other well not
04:02 - easier there's a more efficient way of
04:03 - doing this instead of creating a new car
04:06 - object every time they create this let's
04:09 - just go ahead and use the using keyword
04:11 - so we'll just type using new car one
04:17 - as new all cars.com so then we'll add
04:27 - the end using so let's see here looks
04:34 - like we're getting an error see using
04:37 - operator type must implement systems huh
04:40 - we're gonna have to come over here into
04:43 - our all cars dot V B file and for our
04:48 - class car we're going to how to type
04:51 - implements I disposable so now we can
05:00 - use the using keyword when creating our
05:03 - new car let's find the code right here
05:07 - okay so once it's done creating the car
05:10 - we're gonna want to add that to the list
05:12 - so let's type cars dot add and then
05:16 - we'll just add new car one so it's gonna
05:20 - create that car and it's gonna add it to
05:21 - the list
05:22 - and it's going to destroy the car that
05:24 - was created now we'll go ahead and let's
05:29 - see we need to add we need to access the
05:33 - button click event for add and we'll
05:36 - type me dot close now what this is gonna
05:41 - do is it's going to close out of the
05:48 - dialog that we currently have open now
05:51 - we'll be covering the cancel later on
05:53 - because now even if they click cancel
05:55 - it's going to add that car to the list
05:58 - and we're gonna be working on making it
06:01 - not at the car to the list when I hit
06:02 - cancel so we'll start debugging and see
06:05 - if we get the results that we wanted so
06:08 - we'll type will click new car and it
06:10 - opens up our new car dialog you see that
06:12 - we can't go back to form one so let's
06:16 - set the name of the car - lets do a
06:21 - Dodge Charger set the color of the car
06:25 - to black we'll set the number of doors
06:28 - equal to four and we'll give it three
06:31 - horsepower we'll go ahead and click add
06:34 - and you can see that it added the car to
06:37 - the ArrayList but it did not add the car
06:41 - to the list box so what we're gonna need
06:45 - to do is we'll type list cars dot idem
06:54 - Zaid and we will add new car one and we
07:00 - just want to go ahead and get the car
07:01 - name for that
07:02 - so whatever the name is it's going to be
07:04 - added to that and the index will
07:06 - correspond to the index in our cars
07:07 - ArrayList so we'll do this once more
07:10 - look like new car name of the car will
07:14 - be the Dodge Charger color of car will
07:17 - be black it has four doors and 300
07:22 - horsepower well click Add and you can
07:24 - see that I add the Dodge Charger to the
07:26 - list and we can show the info of the CRV
07:29 - the Mustang and then when we get down to
07:31 - Dodge Charger when we show the info that
07:33 - we get car name Dodge Charger car color
07:36 - is black the number of doors is four and
07:40 - the car speed is zero sorry about that
07:43 - alarm that went off but anyways the car
07:46 - name is dasha Roger black number of
07:47 - doors is four so in the next tutorial
07:50 - we're gonna be talking about using the
07:52 - cancel button so it does not add the car
07:55 - to the list box so go ahead and put this
07:59 - code in if you have it already you can
08:01 - pause it right here if you to do that
08:03 - and then once you're done with that go
08:04 - ahead and move on to the next tutorial
