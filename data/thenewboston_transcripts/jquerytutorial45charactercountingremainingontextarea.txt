00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - this is a video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston now we've already looked at event
00:08 - handling in jQuery however now we're
00:10 - going to create an example application
00:13 - this application is going to involve a
00:15 - text area with a max length a limited
00:18 - amount of text that can actually be
00:20 - typed into the text area but what we're
00:23 - going to do is we're going to use jQuery
00:25 - to feedback to the user how many
00:27 - characters they have remaining so you've
00:29 - probably seen this on site such as
00:30 - Twitter when you type a tweet into the
00:32 - box it will tell you how many characters
00:35 - the user has remaining so let's go ahead
00:38 - and actually design out our HTML I'm
00:41 - going to create a text area just
00:44 - here and I'm going to give it some
00:46 - attributes in just a moment so the
00:49 - attributes we're giving it are an ID and
00:51 - this is used to identify the text area
00:54 - I'm just going to call this text area
00:57 - I'm going to create um two attributes
00:59 - row rows and columns which are just
01:01 - going to be the size so 7 and 25 there
01:05 - and I'm also going to create a max
01:07 - length attribute and this is going to be
01:10 - 55 characters so let's go over to our
01:13 - browser and refresh you can see that
01:15 - we've got a text area we can type some
01:17 - text in let's just copy and paste over
01:20 - and over
01:21 - again and you'll see that the output has
01:24 - stopped here I can't type anything else
01:27 - so the max length has prevented us from
01:30 - typing anything further than 55
01:32 - characters however what we want is a
01:35 - little div down here that's actually
01:37 - going to relay this information back so
01:40 - how many characters we have left as
01:42 - we're actually
01:43 - typing so the first thing we want to do
01:46 - is create a external jQuery file and I'm
01:49 - going to save this inside the JS folder
01:52 - I'm going to call this text area.
01:54 - JS the next thing to do is go ahead and
01:57 - create the
01:58 - div and this is going to be have an ID
02:01 - of text
02:04 - area
02:05 - feedback so as the user types this div
02:08 - is going to be constantly updated with
02:10 - the amount of characters that the user
02:13 - has left to
02:14 - type okay so inside text area. JS we
02:17 - first of all need to use the document
02:20 - ready um functionality of jQuery to
02:24 - actually display an initial character
02:26 - count and this is automatically going to
02:28 - be
02:28 - 55 so let's go ahead and
02:32 - say
02:34 - document do
02:37 - ready so in jQuery uh we use uh a dollar
02:41 - sign and then we're referencing the
02:43 - document spell it properly do ready and
02:47 - inside of here we're going to create a
02:49 - function now this is automatically going
02:52 - to be called code in here when the page
02:55 - loads so we can test this by saying
02:58 - alert hi for example when we refresh the
03:02 - page ah okay so we haven't included this
03:05 - text area. JS file in our page yet so
03:08 - let's go ahead and do that now so script
03:11 - type equals
03:15 - text/javascript the source is going to
03:17 - be
03:18 - jsex area. JS and we end the script just
03:23 - there so let's go ahead and refresh our
03:25 - page to see that uh Notice come up we've
03:26 - got a an alert box coming up saying h
03:29 - tank high so we know that our document
03:33 - um ready uh function is
03:36 - working now what we want to do is set
03:38 - the uh maximum length of the text area
03:43 - so we're going to create a uh variable
03:46 - and this is going to be called um text
03:49 - Max that's going to be equal to
03:52 - 55 now what we want to do is actually
03:55 - initially put some data in this div
03:57 - that's under here to tell them how many
03:59 - characters they actually have to type so
04:02 - we're going to reference this and this
04:04 - is
04:06 - called text area feedback so we want to
04:09 - place some text inside text
04:13 - area feedback using the HTML
04:16 - function and this text is going to be
04:20 - textor Max and then we're going to
04:22 - append on some text and then just say
04:26 - characters
04:28 - remaining so now what happens is when
04:30 - our document has loaded we set this
04:33 - variable text Max which we can use later
04:35 - on in the Pro in our uh code and then we
04:38 - set the text area feedback to 55
04:42 - characters remaining so quite basic
04:44 - let's just refresh the page make sure
04:46 - that works we've got 55 characters
04:49 - remaining now the goal is obviously when
04:51 - we start to type this value is going to
04:54 - uh decrease by one or by you know the
04:57 - characters that a user is typing and we
04:59 - need to get the value in order to do
05:01 - this the first thing that we need to do
05:03 - is check for an event and the event is
05:05 - key up so when a key comes up we need to
05:08 - count the the uh length of the text
05:12 - inside the field
