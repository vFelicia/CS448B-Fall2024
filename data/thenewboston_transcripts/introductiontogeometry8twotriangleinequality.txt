00:01 - so we're going to talk about two
00:03 - triangle inequality and first I'm going
00:06 - to give you the um property of triangle
00:12 - inequality and then I'm going to show
00:14 - you what it means because it is kind of
00:16 - confusing so given that two sides of one
00:19 - triangle are congruent to two sides of a
00:23 - second triangle and the included angle
00:26 - of the first triangle is smaller than
00:28 - the included angle of the second
00:30 - triangle then the third side of the
00:32 - first triangle is smaller than the third
00:35 - side of the second
00:37 - triangle so now that you have that
00:39 - definition I'm going to show you what it
00:42 - means with
00:45 - this picture right
00:47 - here so we know that this side is
00:53 - congruent to this side and this side is
00:56 - congruent to this side so first thing I
00:58 - have to have is is
01:01 - two
01:03 - sides
01:07 - congruent which I do right here's one
01:11 - pair here's another pair second thing I
01:14 - need to know is
01:18 - that this included angle is smaller than
01:22 - this included
01:24 - angle so the included angle is just this
01:28 - angle right here which is caught in
01:30 - between the two congruent sides so right
01:34 - now we're going to be talking about
01:35 - angle K and for this one we're going to
01:38 - be talking about angle
01:40 - J so since we
01:42 - know we need to know that one of
01:45 - these is
01:50 - smaller
01:52 - than the
01:56 - other so I know that the measure of
01:58 - angle K is less than the measure of
02:01 - angle J because 80° is less than
02:06 - 110° so since I have that I can
02:11 - therefore say that
02:14 - a is less than b because this angle is
02:19 - less than this angle so this side is
02:23 - less than this side that's all that that
02:26 - property tells us so now that we know
02:29 - what it is we're going to do an
02:33 - example
02:38 - that we're going to do an
02:41 - example to make sure you completely
02:45 - understand what we're
02:46 - doing so for these two triangles I know
02:50 - that this side is congruent to this side
02:53 - and this side is congruent to this
02:55 - side and I know that this angle is equal
02:58 - to 110° de so I need to find out what
03:02 - the measure of this angle right here is
03:05 - so we're going to go back and use
03:08 - those um that property of the interior
03:12 - angles of
03:13 - triangles to find out what the measure
03:16 - of angle X is so we're going to add them
03:20 - up and set it equal to
03:23 - 180° and we're going to subtract this
03:26 - over and we know that x equal
03:31 - 90° so that means that X is a right
03:37 - angle so we're going to mark that with
03:40 - one of these symbols right here and we
03:42 - know that just means
03:44 - 90° well since the measure of angle X is
03:49 - equal to
03:50 - 90° and
03:52 - 90 is less than
03:55 - 110 that means that this angle is less
03:58 - than this angle
04:00 - so using our two triangle inequalities
04:03 - we can say that a this side opposite
04:07 - this angle is less than b which is this
04:11 - side opposite this included
04:15 - angle we're going to do one more
04:19 - example we have these two side by side
04:22 - triangles we know this side is congruent
04:25 - to this side and since they share this
04:28 - side right here we can say
04:32 - that that it is congruent with
04:36 - itself and I once again I need to find
04:39 - out what this angle equals so we're
04:42 - going to set each one of the interior
04:46 - angles we're going to add them together
04:48 - and set it equal to
04:54 - 180 so X =
04:58 - 110°
05:00 - this angle is
05:02 - 110° so since this included angle is
05:07 - 110° the other included angle is
05:10 - 60° since
05:12 - 110
05:15 - is greater than
05:19 - 60° we can say that this side a which is
05:22 - opposite the
05:24 - 110° is greater than this side B which
05:29 - is opposite the
05:32 - 60° so now that you understand two
05:36 - triangle inequality be sure to come back
05:39 - and watch our next video which is going
05:41 - to deal with square roots and how we can
05:44 - use
05:45 - those to solve triangle
05:49 - problems
