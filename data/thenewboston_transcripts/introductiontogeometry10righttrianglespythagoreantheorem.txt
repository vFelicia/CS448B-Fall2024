00:00 - So today we're talking about right
00:02 - triangles um we're going to learn What's
00:05 - called the Pythagorean theorem and this
00:08 - is where your knowledge of squares and
00:10 - square roots will really help you out
00:13 - because we have this
00:15 - equation a 2 + B2 =
00:18 - c^2 so for any right triangle this long
00:22 - side right here which is called the
00:27 - hypotenuse of the right triangle is
00:30 - equal to this side squared plus this
00:35 - side
00:37 - squared so now that we know that we're
00:40 - going to do an
00:41 - example so this is the
00:47 - hypotenuse this is our
00:51 - hypotenuse and this is what we're trying
00:53 - to find out so a 2 which is 8 2ar plus
01:00 - 6^ 2ar is equal to X2 or c^ 2 it's the
01:08 - same thing because they're just
01:10 - variables so 8 SAR is
01:13 - 64 + 6 2ar is 36 is equal to
01:21 - X2 so 100 is equal to
01:26 - X2 but we want to know what x is equal
01:29 - to 2 so we're going to take the square
01:31 - root of both sides and we get X is = to
01:37 - 10 now we're going to do another
01:41 - example so notice that we
01:47 - know we know what our hypotenuse is
01:50 - equal but we want to know what this is
01:52 - equal to so we're going to like we would
01:55 - normally we're going
01:57 - to
01:58 - take
02:00 - a 2 + b^ 2 and set it equal to the
02:06 - hypotenuse
02:09 - squared
02:11 - so
02:13 - 49 +
02:15 - X2
02:17 - is is equal to
02:23 - 625 so X2 is equal
02:28 - to is
02:31 - equal
02:35 - to
02:38 - 576 and if we take the square roots of
02:41 - both sides we get X = to
02:46 - 24 and for one last
02:50 - example we
02:53 - have so this is our
02:57 - hypotenuse and we're trying to find out
02:59 - out what x equals so we're going to take
03:05 - each one of the parts square and square
03:09 - them and set it equal to 5
03:11 - squar so if you take the square root of
03:16 - seven and you square it you're undoing
03:19 - this square root so this just becomes s
03:23 - + X2 =
03:28 - 25 X
03:31 - squar is equal to
03:34 - 18 you take the square root of that you
03:37 - get X is equal to the square < TK of
03:41 - 18 18 is not a perfect
03:45 - square so we're just going to leave it
03:47 - written like that because there's no
03:51 - way because this isn't a whole
03:54 - number X is not a whole
03:57 - number so now that we've learned the
04:00 - Pythagorean theorem we're going to learn
04:03 - some rules for special right triangles
04:06 - in our next video
