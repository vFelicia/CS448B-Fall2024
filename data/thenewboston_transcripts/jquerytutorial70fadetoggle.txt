00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in the past couple of videos we have
00:07 - looked at the fade in and fade out
00:09 - functions however the disadvantage to
00:12 - this is you don't have the option to use
00:14 - one button to toggle this effect we've
00:17 - already looked at toggling different
00:19 - effects such as showing and hiding
00:21 - things however there is a function in
00:23 - jQuery called
00:25 - fade toggle and this allows us to use
00:29 - two different states the first state
00:31 - will be well the option you give it and
00:35 - then the second step it will be a fade
00:37 - in or fade out and then the second state
00:40 - will be to obviously do the reverse
00:43 - so to fade in off to fade out so what we
00:46 - can actually do is start to create our
00:48 - image so I'll just include our image in
00:51 - here and this is tartan jpg oh I'll just
00:58 - give tartan we need to give this an ID
01:01 - as well so I'll give this an ID of image
01:05 - now what I want to do is create one
01:07 - single button which is going to fade in
01:09 - and fade out these simultaneously so if
01:12 - I go ahead and create an input type
01:14 - button and we'll give this a value of
01:19 - fade in/out
01:24 - okay so let's break up now in a
01:27 - paragraph there okay so let's go ahead
01:31 - and preview this in our browser you can
01:33 - see that we've got one button fade in
01:34 - our Anna and our image is currently
01:37 - displayed and because our images that
01:39 - currently displayed when we press this
01:41 - button it will actually fade our image
01:43 - out when we press the button again it
01:45 - will fade the image back in so now let's
01:48 - go ahead and create the functionality
01:50 - for this inside effect Jas I've already
01:53 - included this in my page as well as
01:55 - jQuery so let's go to effects Jas okay
01:59 - so first of all we need to create a
02:01 - event handler so an event handler for
02:04 - the button which we have named we didn't
02:07 - give it an ID so let's give that an ID
02:09 - first I'm just gonna call this say in
02:13 - out so the button in out we need to
02:17 - check for a click what we then need to
02:21 - do is inside we have this function and
02:23 - inside of this block here we'll bring
02:25 - that down and we start to use the fade
02:30 - toggle function so we reference our
02:33 - image so that's hash image and then we
02:36 - say dot fade toggle so this doesn't
02:41 - require any parameters such as like the
02:44 - hide the show function the fade in and
02:46 - the fade out function however let's go
02:48 - ahead and test it and then give it some
02:50 - additional parameters so let's click
02:52 - this you can see our image fades out and
02:54 - we click it again and you see it fade in
02:56 - now similarly if you wanted the image to
03:00 - be faded out beforehand you can use CSS
03:03 - to style this so I'm gonna just create a
03:06 - style attribute in my image tag
03:09 - obviously inline CSS isn't recommended
03:13 - but for the purpose of this tutorial I'm
03:15 - going to use it and I'm just gonna write
03:17 - display and then none so now what will
03:20 - happen is when we refresh our browser
03:22 - the image doesn't exist well it does
03:24 - exist but it's not shown when I click
03:26 - fade in fade out it automatically fades
03:29 - us in so it detects its visibility and
03:32 - then toggles it accordingly
03:35 - we can then again fade out and back in
03:37 - again now there are additional
03:39 - parameters for fade toggle we have
03:41 - either a textual representation of the
03:44 - speed for example slow will just simply
03:47 - slow the animation down you'll see there
03:49 - is significantly slower we can also then
03:51 - give it a speed so alternatively we can
03:54 - give it a speed for example 500 which is
03:57 - 5 seconds 5000 sorry which is 5 seconds
04:00 - we were to fade in you can see it takes
04:03 - significantly longer to fade in we also
04:06 - have the option to use a callback
04:08 - function well beforehand you can set the
04:12 - the animation type as well by default it
04:16 - is swing that's if you don't give it any
04:19 - parameter however you also have linear
04:22 - which doesn't make too much of a
04:24 - difference but this can be used in most
04:27 - animation effects so we also have the
04:30 - option for a callback function and this
04:34 - essentially will just do something once
04:36 - the animation has been complete so for
04:38 - example we can alert the user animation
04:42 - complete what's going to happen now is
04:45 - once we click the button we're going to
04:46 - toggle the fade it's going to be 5
04:49 - seconds the effect type is going to be
04:51 - linear and this callback function here
04:53 - with this block in here will be run but
04:56 - only once the animation is complete so
04:58 - ie
04:59 - the image is completely faded in or
05:01 - faded out so we can test that now by
05:03 - clicking fade in you'll see that that
05:05 - takes about five seconds to fade in and
05:08 - once it has faded in we will have a
05:10 - alert box come up saying animation
05:14 - complete and then again that's the same
05:16 - with fading out if we press it we wait
05:18 - about five seconds well exactly five
05:20 - seconds for it to fade out and then we
05:22 - have the same dialog box up here so
05:26 - that's the fade toggle function in
05:29 - jQuery
