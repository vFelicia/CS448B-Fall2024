00:00 - instead we need to add an extra line
00:03 - underneath here and basically what this
00:07 - line is going to do is it's going to set
00:10 - a request header and we're going to go
00:13 - to the content type of of when we submit
00:16 - so let's go ahead and write this out so
00:19 - we're going to say XML HTTP set request
00:23 - header so it's almost like the header
00:28 - function in PHP but this time what we're
00:30 - doing is we're specifying two parameters
00:32 - and for the first one was saying content
00:35 - type and then we're setting the content
00:38 - type in here and this is application /xw
00:42 - W and then it's a - again and we're
00:48 - going to say form
00:50 - - URL encoded okay so this is basically
00:54 - saying we're sending for a form data
00:56 - through as a post and we specify post
00:59 - here remember now this isn't actually
01:02 - going to work as it stands because we
01:04 - need to predefined some parameters that
01:06 - we want to send and remember the
01:08 - parameter that we want to send is the
01:10 - value of this text here so let's go
01:13 - ahead and create a variable called
01:15 - parameters and we're going to equal that
01:19 - to something and then we're going to
01:20 - append something on the end and the
01:22 - something here is what we want to be
01:24 - read as the post variable name so I'm
01:27 - going to say this is text and then I'm
01:29 - going to tell us equal to something so
01:32 - what we can actually do is we can
01:34 - actually set this now to hello for
01:36 - example and we need to send these
01:39 - parameters through now this looks like
01:41 - get data would by by same text equals
01:44 - hello we can also say and something
01:47 - equals hello to or something like that
01:50 - you know
01:50 - we can send a limited post variables
01:53 - through here however now we need to find
01:56 - a way to send these parameters through
01:58 - to our updating PHP because at the
02:01 - moment we've just put them into a
02:02 - variable what we need to do is we need
02:04 - to actually put it into the apprentice a
02:10 - parameters in there so what this is
02:13 - going to do now is it's going to open
02:15 - this update dot Inc dot PHP file ready
02:17 - to post post data we're sending we're
02:20 - changing the content type of the page so
02:22 - we can submit the post data successfully
02:24 - and then we're sending the parameters
02:26 - through to the page and that's about it
02:29 - that should work so because I've
02:30 - specified this post data as hello the
02:33 - posts term variable names text and the
02:35 - values hello all we need to do now is
02:38 - change this to post and you can see and
02:40 - that we would have posted this value
02:42 - through as post data so hopefully this
02:45 - works let's click on submit and you can
02:48 - see we've got hello so now what we've
02:50 - done is we've achieved the whole point
02:52 - of the tutorial and we've posted some
02:54 - data through the using the post method
02:58 - but obviously that's not good enough
03:00 - what we're going to do is we're going to
03:01 - specify this to be the value of our text
03:05 - box here so our text input type here so
03:10 - we're going to say document dot get
03:12 - element by ID that thing I struggled
03:16 - with so much earlier and we're going to
03:18 - say text then we're going to say dot
03:22 - value so remember what we know we don't
03:24 - need the parentheses so remember we
03:26 - essentially echoed out earlier so now
03:28 - what should happen is we should get this
03:30 - element by ID which is text down here we
03:33 - should grab the value of it and post it
03:35 - through to our update dot in Inc PHP so
03:38 - it's a bit more dynamic now so we can
03:40 - test the well how dynamic this is let's
03:43 - just type in my name and click Submit
03:45 - then nothing's happened surprise
03:48 - surprise surprise okay so the problem
03:50 - here is that I'm still in the frame of
03:53 - mind with PHP I need to start
03:56 - remembering we're coding in JavaScript
03:58 - now
03:58 - we're going to put a plus two a pen and
04:00 - not a dot that's why I wasn't working so
04:03 - let's go back to our page or refresh I'm
04:06 - going to type my name as I wanted before
04:08 - click Submit and we've posted this data
04:10 - through successfully so whatever we type
04:13 - in here and we click Submit is going to
04:17 - be posted through to our update Inc PHP
04:22 - so now in updating dot PHP we need to
04:25 - start connecting to our database in
04:27 - order to start putting the data into
04:30 - this data field inside of our table so
04:33 - let's just refresh the page so we can
04:35 - start again in a minute okay so the
04:37 - first thing we need to do is connect to
04:39 - our database there's other videos and
04:41 - connecting to the database this isn't
04:42 - the greatest way to do it we may
04:44 - retrieve errors etc etc etc so we refer
04:47 - back to my older videos to up what other
04:49 - videos to have a look so when this takes
04:53 - three parameters we need the host
04:55 - obviously we need the username we need
04:58 - the password which for me is just blank
05:00 - at the moment and then we need to select
05:02 - our database sort of connected to our
05:04 - MySQL server now selecting our database
05:07 - and this is called Ajax so if we go back
05:09 - over to our MySQL sorry PHP myadmin
05:13 - our database is called Ajax now what we
05:16 - need to do is check if this post
05:18 - variable called text has been set so we
05:22 - need to say if and we use the is set
05:25 - here and we say if is set post text do
05:30 - something and this something is going to
05:33 - be just for now echo out okay just to
05:36 - check that everything's working so let's
05:39 - go back here and type in Alex and click
05:41 - Submit we get an okay back here so we
05:45 - know that this value has been set
