00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new bustin
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - looking at the remove class attribute in
00:09 - jQuery now in the last video we looked
00:11 - at the add class attribute however in
00:14 - this example we're going to create
00:15 - something slightly different and a bit
00:17 - more fun to demonstrate the remove class
00:19 - now add class and remove class can take
00:22 - an unlimited amount of classes to be
00:25 - removed or added so for example in the
00:29 - last part we looked at adding a class
00:31 - using add class and then we specified a
00:34 - class name for example bold if you had
00:37 - another class for example underlined you
00:40 - could also supply this as well now when
00:43 - you're using remove class you can do
00:45 - exactly the same thing now we're not
00:47 - going to be demonstrating multiple
00:48 - classes in this tutorial however what we
00:50 - are going to be doing is creating
00:52 - something a bit more dynamic and we're
00:54 - going to do that using the event the
00:56 - event handler toggle so let's go ahead
00:59 - and create a span and I'm gonna give
01:03 - this an ID of some text and I'm just
01:06 - gonna write this is some text okay so
01:09 - now if we go over to our browser you can
01:12 - see that we've got this is some text
01:13 - what I want to happen is when we click
01:15 - on this I want the text to be
01:17 - highlighted or underlined it doesn't
01:19 - really matter what we do but when we
01:21 - click on it
01:22 - I want a class to be added to it okay so
01:24 - let's go over to class j/s where we have
01:28 - our code in fact no let's first of all
01:30 - go over to style dot CSS and create this
01:32 - class so I'm going to create the cut of
01:34 - the class highlight and inside I'm gonna
01:37 - say background yellow so what this will
01:41 - do is once I apply this class to the
01:43 - text here it'll essentially highlight it
01:46 - let's just demonstrate that now
01:52 - and when we go over to our browser you
01:54 - can see that the text has been
01:55 - highlighted so we're going to use the
01:57 - add class and the remove class
01:59 - attributes in sequence using the toggle
02:03 - event handler once we click on this span
02:06 - and then that's going to highlight and
02:07 - then unhighlight so some practical use
02:10 - there as well as just being an example
02:12 - okay so we've got our highlight class in
02:15 - style dot CSS now let's go ahead and
02:18 - create our toggle event handler so we
02:20 - need to reference the some text span so
02:24 - I'm just going to write some text and
02:27 - then say dr. toggle now inside of here
02:30 - we can specify two different functions
02:33 - to be used in sequence with each other
02:35 - so we can either create these inside of
02:37 - this inside of these parentheses or we
02:41 - can create functions outside and in
02:43 - reference these inside for now just to
02:45 - get the hang of things we'll create them
02:47 - inside so I've created the function
02:49 - outline or the define the function and I
02:51 - have my block here the second parameter
02:53 - we are creating another function and
02:57 - we're just gonna pull these down so we
02:59 - can work a bit easier okay so the first
03:03 - thing I want to do is it for it to
03:04 - actually highlight the text so we're
03:06 - going to use an example as we used in
03:08 - the previous tutorial but with bold but
03:10 - we're actually going to apply the
03:11 - highlight class to some text so dot add
03:16 - class once we've referenced the text
03:18 - here and inside of that we specify the
03:22 - class itself so which is highlight we've
03:26 - named the class highlight in our CSS
03:27 - file now what I'm going to do is do
03:30 - exactly the same thing again I'm going
03:32 - to reference some text but this time I'm
03:35 - going to remove the class and in there
03:39 - specify the class I want to remove which
03:41 - is highlight and like I said before you
03:44 - can specify to add or remove multiple
03:46 - classes so you could go ahead and
03:48 - specify a bold or and underlined in here
03:51 - or any class that you've created so now
03:54 - what's going to happen is when we click
03:55 - on the text it's going to toggle using
03:58 - the toggle event handler and we're gonna
04:00 - first of all going to add the class
04:01 - highlight which will add this back
04:03 - round yellow to that text as I showed
04:05 - you earlier in the browser what we're
04:07 - then gonna do is next time you press it
04:09 - we're gonna actually remove this class
04:11 - so we're essentially just selecting
04:13 - something or highlighting something on a
04:14 - page so we'll go ahead and refresh the
04:17 - page when I click on this now you can
04:19 - see that it highlights when I click on
04:21 - it again you can see that the highlight
04:23 - disappears now let's go ahead and add
04:25 - some additional classes so I'm going to
04:29 - say bold and in here I'm going to choose
04:34 - font-weight:bold so now what I can do is
04:38 - when I click on it I might want to also
04:40 - add boldness to it so when i refresh
04:44 - when I click on it you can see that it's
04:46 - been highlighted and now it's bold now
04:49 - what's going to happen here is because
04:50 - we're only removing the highlight class
04:53 - we are keeping the bold class added to
04:57 - this text so when we click here you can
05:00 - see that the text remains bold but the
05:01 - highlight disappears so now we're stuck
05:04 - with bold text so you can supply
05:07 - additional classes that you want to add
05:10 - or remove we can go ahead and remove
05:12 - bold as well so now it will go bold and
05:16 - highlighted and then back to normal so
05:19 - add class and remove class take an
05:21 - unlimited amount of classes that you can
05:23 - add or remove to them and can obviously
05:26 - be used for a large number of HTML
05:30 - elements
