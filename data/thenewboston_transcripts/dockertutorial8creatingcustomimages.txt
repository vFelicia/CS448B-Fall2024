00:00 - all right y'all welcome back and in this
00:03 - video
00:03 - i'm gonna be showing you guys how to
00:04 - create custom images
00:06 - in docker now i just wanna preface this
00:10 - by saying that there are actually a
00:11 - couple
00:12 - different techniques we can use to
00:13 - create images in docker
00:15 - this one is the more manual process it's
00:18 - not
00:19 - the one that you're typically going to
00:20 - be using but the reason i want to teach
00:22 - this first
00:23 - is to give you guys a nitty-gritty
00:25 - detailed breakdown of exactly what's
00:27 - going on
00:28 - it's just going to make the future
00:29 - concepts easier to understand
00:31 - now this technique specifically is going
00:33 - to involve taking an
00:34 - existing image applying some changes on
00:37 - top of that
00:38 - and in this case it's just going to be
00:40 - installing some new software we're going
00:42 - to be installing redis
00:43 - and then once we have all the changes
00:45 - made we're more or less going to take a
00:47 - snapshot
00:48 - of those changes and say this is our new
00:51 - image
00:52 - so the first thing that we're going to
00:53 - need is a base image and for this
00:55 - we can just use alpine which is a very
00:57 - stripped down
00:58 - basic version of linux and
01:01 - we also want to run it in interactive
01:04 - mode
01:05 - so we can provide input so dash i t
01:08 - another thing i want to do is i want to
01:10 - give this container a name
01:12 - so bucky's container let's just call it
01:16 - something
01:17 - really easy and again this is just so
01:19 - later on we can refer to the container
01:21 - without using those you know random
01:24 - strings those hash values
01:26 - so all right we want to run a container
01:29 - and we want it to be called bucky's
01:31 - container
01:32 - and what do we want to use we can just
01:34 - use alpine
01:36 - let me minimize my screen here so we're
01:39 - going to use
01:39 - alpine the latest version and then
01:42 - we're just going to say is a default
01:44 - command just give us shell
01:47 - so all right it's not finding it locally
01:49 - so it just downloaded
01:51 - this from docker hub and
01:54 - all right so with this base alpine image
01:58 - we now have a container running on our
02:00 - system that we can make some changes to
02:03 - so what do we want to do like i said the
02:04 - only package or
02:07 - software that we're going to be
02:07 - installing is redis just to get
02:09 - something real simple up there
02:11 - so apk this is the built-in package
02:14 - manager
02:15 - that came with alpine and what we want
02:17 - to do to install redis
02:19 - is just say add update make sure we're
02:21 - getting all the latest version
02:23 - redis right there all right so nice and
02:26 - quick what it did
02:28 - is basically installed redis on our
02:30 - alpine
02:32 - base image so now what we're looking at
02:35 - is a container with
02:36 - redis installed pretty simple so what i
02:39 - want to do now
02:40 - is actually exit out of here and we can
02:42 - review our containers by going docker
02:45 - container lsa all right now
02:49 - let me expand this in okay so what we
02:52 - are looking at here
02:53 - is our one container it's called bucky's
02:56 - container and it has
02:58 - redis installed on it so now what we
03:00 - would like to do
03:01 - is basically use this container and take
03:04 - a snapshot of it
03:06 - and create an image from that so what
03:09 - we'll end up with
03:10 - is a brand new image with redis
03:12 - installed on it
03:13 - so to do that again it's docker
03:16 - container
03:17 - commit now this commit keyword is the
03:20 - one that actually creates the new
03:22 - image from this bucky's container
03:25 - container now another thing that i want
03:27 - to point out
03:28 - is if you read the definition of this
03:31 - command online
03:32 - or in docker's documentation they
03:34 - technically
03:35 - don't say create a new image from a
03:37 - container what they say is
03:39 - we're going to be creating a new image
03:41 - from a container's
03:43 - changes so technically what this is
03:46 - doing
03:46 - is it's not just creating something
03:48 - brand new it's taking that
03:50 - base image and applying those changes to
03:53 - it and in our case that just involves
03:55 - installing redis
03:56 - and it creates a new image from that
03:58 - again this isn't really important for
04:00 - where we are now in our learning and our
04:02 - knowledge it's essentially how docker
04:04 - makes the
04:05 - image creation process more efficient
04:07 - among other things but again
04:09 - we just want to look at the different
04:10 - methods of creating containers right now
04:12 - so you know
04:13 - just some nice little background info
04:15 - for you so anyways back to the meat and
04:16 - potatoes of this
04:18 - whenever you run docker container commit
04:21 - the first argument we're going to pass
04:23 - in
04:23 - is what is the container that you
04:26 - want to use as a source and well we only
04:29 - have one container that we have
04:30 - retis installed on so not too many
04:33 - options there
04:34 - the next one is what do you want your
04:36 - new image to be named and i'm just going
04:38 - to name mine
04:39 - creatively bucky's image so all we're
04:42 - doing
04:42 - is we're saying hey docker can you
04:44 - create a new image
04:47 - called bucky's image from bucky's
04:50 - container
04:51 - and once we hit enter it says yes and it
04:54 - gives us back the id
04:56 - so now we can actually verify that we
04:58 - have the image created by
05:00 - doing docker image ls and
05:03 - look at that 3781e37ad1e
05:08 - new image called bucky's image looking
05:10 - good now if we want to use this image
05:13 - to create and run a new container then
05:16 - we already know how to do that
05:18 - just clear some of this out so i'm gonna
05:20 - do
05:21 - docker container run bucky's image
05:25 - now remember this image is a blueprint
05:27 - for
05:28 - you know basically a stripped down
05:29 - version of linux with
05:31 - redis installed on it but the redis
05:33 - server is actually
05:34 - running on it the software is installed
05:37 - but no process
05:38 - is running so the default command for
05:40 - this or the startup command
05:42 - if i could type is redis server so now
05:46 - when i hit enter it's going to take
05:47 - bucky's image start up a container from
05:51 - it
05:51 - and then run the redis server and there
05:54 - you go
05:56 - so just to verify that this is indeed
05:58 - working as expected if you pop over to a
06:01 - new tab
06:02 - we can just test it out by running the
06:04 - redis cli on this container
06:07 - or in this container interesting how
06:09 - would you say that
06:10 - any hoots so first let's just check out
06:13 - our containers
06:14 - using docker container lsa and what do
06:17 - we got
06:19 - all right so we have this first one that
06:21 - was created from the alpine image
06:22 - and remember we did that at the very
06:24 - beginning of this video
06:26 - and then we had this new container that
06:28 - was created from
06:30 - bucky's image and this is running the
06:32 - redis server so this is the one we're
06:34 - just gonna
06:35 - tap into real quick and make sure
06:36 - everything's working correctly
06:38 - so what we can do and let me see the
06:41 - name of that one
06:42 - all right probably should have gave our
06:43 - new one a custom name
06:45 - but apparently docker decided to name it
06:48 - laughing
06:49 - matsumoto i don't know what that means
06:53 - probably whoever doesn't know how to
06:54 - pronounce that is laughing at me
06:56 - right now but any hoot moving on so
06:59 - docker container and we just want to run
07:02 - a command
07:03 - in that and of course we're going to
07:05 - need our
07:06 - interactive prompt and the container
07:08 - name
07:09 - laughing matsumoto it's actually a
07:11 - pretty cool name
07:12 - and what is our default command we want
07:14 - to run here well let's just run
07:16 - redis cli all right
07:20 - so it looks like we are now running
07:22 - reddit cli
07:23 - in this container and what command can i
07:26 - run just help all right
07:28 - so run the help command make sure
07:29 - everything is working correctly
07:31 - and there you go so again that is one
07:33 - technique that you can use to create
07:35 - custom images
07:36 - again it's not the technique that you're
07:38 - going to be typically using
07:40 - this is more of a manual technique but
07:42 - lucky for us
07:43 - in the next tutorial we're going to be
07:44 - looking at an easier way
07:46 - to create images using docker and that
07:49 - is
07:50 - through a docker file it's going to be
07:52 - awesome make our life a whole lot easier
07:54 - but for now thank you guys for watching
07:56 - don't forget to subscribe and i will see
07:57 - you in the next video
