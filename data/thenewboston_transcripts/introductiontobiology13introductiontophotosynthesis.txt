00:00 - welcome back everyone my name is Sarah
00:02 - and in these next couple of videos I'm
00:04 - going to be covering the process of
00:08 - photosynthesis in this video I'm going
00:09 - to be talking about the structure of the
00:12 - chloroplast and some stuff about light
00:16 - the theory of Light how it acts all that
00:18 - good kind of stuff and give a brief
00:21 - little overview of the actual process of
00:24 - photosynthesis and in my next videos
00:26 - I'll go into more detail about the
00:28 - photosystems and the Calvin cycle
00:31 - photosynthesis is the process by which
00:34 - light energy is captured and then is
00:36 - used to synthesiz carbohydrates the
00:40 - general reaction is you take six
00:42 - molecules of carbon dioxide and six
00:44 - molecules of Water and Light energy in
00:47 - the form of photons to produce a one
00:51 - molecule of glucose and six molecules of
00:55 - oxygen and during this process carbon
00:57 - dioxide is going to get reduced water is
01:00 - going to get oxidized and it is an
01:03 - endergonic reaction which means it
01:05 - requires energy to proceed and that
01:08 - energy like I said is in the form of
01:10 - light en photosynthesis mainly takes
01:13 - place in plants and green algae it can
01:16 - take place in some bacteria too but
01:19 - we're not going to really discuss that I
01:20 - mean the process is the same they just
01:22 - don't have the specialized organel for
01:24 - it but anyways in Plants it's going to
01:27 - take place in the mesophile of of the
01:30 - leaves Within These mes mesophi there
01:32 - are structures called chloroplasts and
01:35 - these chloroplasts contain what are
01:37 - called thids they're just little flat
01:39 - membrane Stacks they these things called
01:42 - photosystems that trap light energy in
01:44 - the thids and then carbon fixation is
01:48 - going to occur in this stroma of the
01:52 - chloroplast and you can see my little
01:54 - drawing here of the chloroplast you got
01:57 - the outer membrane the inner membrane
02:00 - the thids which are organized into big
02:03 - Stacks called gra or Grana however you
02:05 - want to pronounce it the stroma is just
02:08 - this material between the thids and the
02:11 - inner
02:12 - membrane the plant is going to get water
02:15 - through the roots um it's absorbed and
02:17 - transported up to the leaves through
02:19 - what is called xylem and CO2 is going to
02:23 - enter through stomata which are little
02:25 - like pores within the leave these
02:27 - stomata are going to prot be protected
02:29 - by guard cells so nothing else that's
02:32 - not that's not supposed to be there is
02:34 - going to come in and then oxygen is also
02:37 - going to leave through the
02:38 - stata so the nature of light light is a
02:42 - type of electromagnetic radiation it
02:45 - travels as a
02:47 - wave it's got short wavelengths or long
02:50 - wavelengths and it also be behaves as a
02:54 - particle light energy be comes in these
02:57 - little bundles called photons
03:01 - light has two different or three
03:05 - different properties rather you've got
03:06 - your velocity which is 3 * 10 8 m/
03:10 - second which is hey freaking fast dude
03:14 - but um
03:16 - this velocity is not going to change for
03:19 - the most part so the properties of light
03:23 - are based on their frequency and their
03:26 - wavelength so visible light has a wave
03:29 - length of anywhere from 380 NM to 780 NM
03:36 - and the shorter the wavelength the
03:37 - higher the energy there are several
03:40 - different pigments involved with
03:42 - photosynthesis you got chlorophyll a is
03:44 - the main pigment chlorophyll B and
03:46 - keratinoid are accessory
03:49 - pigments and the color depends on what
03:52 - wavelengths of light are absorbed or
03:54 - reflected or transmitted for example
03:57 - leaves are green because they're going
03:58 - to reflect green
04:00 - lights white like white flowers and
04:03 - things like that reflect all colors of
04:06 - light and a black flower for example
04:09 - would absorb all colors of light so the
04:12 - actual process of photosynthesis has
04:15 - four different events that happen in two
04:17 - phases you've got your photochemical
04:20 - reactions and electron transport chem
04:23 - osmosis and carbon fixation and the two
04:26 - phases you got the light phase where
04:28 - oxygen is generated
04:31 - also uh hydrogen ions to form the Chim
04:35 - osmosis ATP and nadh and then during the
04:39 - dark phase which is light independent
04:42 - this is going to use ATP nadph and
04:45 - carbon dioxide to form carbohydrates
