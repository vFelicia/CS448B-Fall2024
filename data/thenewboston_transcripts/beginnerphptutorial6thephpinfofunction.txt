00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and welcome to a PHP video tutorial for
00:06 - the new Boston now after we've installed
00:08 - PHP and perhaps later on in our PHP
00:13 - development we may need to take a
00:15 - detailed look at everything within our
00:18 - PHP installation so for example you
00:21 - might go on later to look at the GD
00:24 - library so the GD library is used to
00:27 - generate images using its command set so
00:31 - it's a it's an addition to PHP it may
00:34 - not be included well I know it's not
00:36 - included with the original PHP
00:38 - installation so for example if someone
00:41 - was to say to you do you have curl
00:43 - installed or do you have G HD image
00:46 - installed and you know what these are
00:49 - and there's different different
00:51 - libraries for PHP but you needed to find
00:54 - a way to quickly check everything in
00:56 - your PHP installation and just find
00:59 - general information about your PHP
01:01 - version for example someone might ask
01:04 - you or you might need to find out which
01:05 - PHP version you're using because
01:07 - obviously different features of PHP work
01:11 - with different versions you may have a
01:14 - an older version of PHP which then later
01:18 - features aren't available so you always
01:20 - want to check that your update to the
01:21 - latest PHP version and you can check
01:23 - this also using this PHP info function
01:27 - that we're going to be talking about so
01:29 - to call the function is relatively
01:31 - simple it's just within your PHP tag to
01:35 - remember we create our PHP tags like
01:38 - this we can do PHP and then info and
01:41 - then two brackets so this is the
01:44 - standard notation for calling a function
01:45 - you can see that my text editor hasn't
01:48 - turned it blue like it normally would
01:49 - with other other language constructs for
01:52 - example echo you can see is
01:54 - automatically turned blue this is
01:55 - because it's a language construct within
01:58 - PHP it's something that's built-in and
02:01 - enables something to happen when we when
02:03 - we run it so PHP info we're just calling
02:06 - a function key you can see that it's
02:08 - remained black just like when we type
02:10 - something that
02:11 - doesn't exist for example it's also
02:16 - black so you need to watch out for this
02:17 - this means that we're calling a function
02:19 - so we're calling the function PHP door
02:21 - in pit sorry PHP info and I've saved
02:24 - this in index.php so let's come over to
02:27 - our browser and let's refresh and see
02:30 - what we get okay so here you can see
02:33 - that we are listing a a selection of
02:38 - data about our PHP installation so we've
02:41 - got PHP version so very very top in
02:44 - large letters we've got the version that
02:47 - we're running and if we go down we can
02:49 - see different things things that are
02:51 - enabled for example not enabled then we
02:54 - can come down and look at specific
02:55 - things like inside the PHP core so a lot
02:58 - of these will worm will be relative to
03:01 - your PHP dot ini file which we looked at
03:04 - previously and we will be looking at
03:06 - later on in the tutorials so let's just
03:09 - go down and see what information we have
03:13 - ok so all this information we've got
03:15 - information about Apache as well the
03:17 - Apache environment so that's our web
03:18 - server HTTP headers information down
03:22 - here about BC math calendar and just
03:24 - things like this that we don't have
03:25 - installed currently and then we can come
03:28 - down to things like FTP support Gd so
03:31 - for example earlier I mentioned the GD
03:33 - library you can see that GD support is
03:36 - enabled we've got the GD version which
03:38 - is bundled with this package etc etc
03:41 - we've got support for different things
03:43 - so you can find a lot of information out
03:45 - about your PHP installation by just by
03:48 - calling this function and it generates a
03:50 - long list of thing details about your
03:53 - PHP installation now one thing is really
03:56 - really important you mustn't keep a file
03:59 - with this function on your server you
04:01 - must not have this live on a server in
04:07 - fact even on your local machine if you
04:09 - know that you're not protected against
04:10 - people accessing this this will give
04:12 - people lots of detailed information
04:14 - about your PHP installation
04:16 - now the reason I'm okay to show you is
04:18 - because I'm working on a local machine
04:20 - it's not giving any information that I
04:22 - that
04:23 - you know could harm my my computer
04:26 - through my internet connection if you're
04:28 - running a say a website and you had this
04:30 - command somewhere on your website that
04:33 - allowed people to view they can view all
04:34 - sorts of information about your PHP
04:36 - installation
04:37 - so despite now seeing it work you also
04:40 - must realize that if you have to do this
04:42 - do it and then quickly delete it so
04:44 - that's just a bit of security advice for
04:46 - you so we've run through the PHP info
04:49 - function which gives out information
04:50 - about your PHP installation and
04:53 - obviously you can use this when you need
04:55 - to find out any specifics about your PHP
04:58 - package
