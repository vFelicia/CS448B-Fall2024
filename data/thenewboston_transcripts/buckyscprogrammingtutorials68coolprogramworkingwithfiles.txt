00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 68th c++
00:02 - tutorial and these next couple tutorials
00:05 - are gonna be a chain of tutorials I
00:07 - can't teach you guys what I'm gonna
00:09 - teach you in one tutorial so it's
00:11 - probably gonna be like a 3 or 4 part
00:13 - series but anyways what I'm gonna be
00:15 - teaching you guys is this I'm gonna be
00:17 - building a really cool program showing
00:19 - you how to work with files and by the
00:21 - end of these tutorials you guys are
00:22 - gonna be a pro on how to work with files
00:24 - so basically what we're gonna be doing
00:27 - is we're gonna be pretending we're
00:28 - making a computer game now in this
00:31 - computer game we have a character and
00:33 - this character in his own little world
00:35 - is going to come across a bunch of
00:37 - different objects some objects have no
00:39 - effect on them whatsoever zero effect on
00:42 - his health or is you know happiness
00:44 - whatever you want to call it some
00:46 - objects like ninjas meth and dirty
00:48 - needles they harm our character so
00:51 - they're gonna you know have negative 50
00:53 - for energy or what you say it's like
00:56 - energy or something now some objects
00:58 - like a fruit a soda and candy help our
01:02 - character out so they're going to give
01:03 - them positive energy so as you can see
01:05 - we have a file with a name and the
01:09 - effect that it has on our character's
01:11 - energy so we're going to be building a
01:13 - program just to print out these
01:15 - different types of items and groups for
01:18 - example we're going to have the user
01:19 - press one if they want to print out all
01:21 - the plain items like a shoe a pencil and
01:23 - chair press two if they want to print
01:26 - out the helpful items like fruit and
01:28 - soda and candy and press three if they
01:31 - want to print out the harmful items like
01:33 - a ninja meth and a dirty needle now
01:36 - we'll have them press 4 if they just
01:37 - want to quit the program altogether and
01:39 - you know go watch YouTube videos so
01:41 - that's the basics of what we're gonna be
01:43 - doing we're gonna be incorporating a
01:45 - program with a file and it's gonna work
01:48 - beautifully together but like I said
01:50 - it's going to take more than one video
01:51 - so just be prepared for that so let's go
01:55 - ahead and start coding this baby right
01:57 - meow so the first thing we want to do is
02:00 - we want to give them a menu to choose
02:02 - from now this menu is going to be 1 2 3
02:05 - 4 depending on what they press we're
02:07 - going to output the appropriate items so
02:09 - we're going to want to store this
02:11 - variable either 1 2 3 or 4
02:13 - in a variable so just go ahead and make
02:16 - will store this number in variable named
02:18 - what they want now this will be equal to
02:22 - one two three or four so now what we can
02:26 - do is we can just take that variable
02:28 - what they want and we're going to set it
02:30 - equal to a function in order you know to
02:32 - get the number from them so we'll just
02:34 - name this function get what they want
02:38 - now we didn't build this function yet
02:40 - and this obviously isn't a built in
02:42 - function on C++ so we need to go ahead
02:44 - and build it right now so what I like to
02:47 - do actually is whenever I'm building a
02:50 - big program that's gonna be working with
02:52 - a lot of functions above each function
02:54 - well I'll just do with main first I like
02:56 - to leave a comment just the function
02:59 - name like a main function and you guys
03:03 - may be like alright why the heck do you
03:04 - want to do that well if you notice the
03:07 - comments are a different color and it
03:09 - makes it really easy to find functions
03:11 - whenever you're scrolling through like
03:13 - three hundred three thousand lines of
03:14 - code so you guys might be like alright
03:16 - that's kind of dumb but trust me do it
03:18 - it's gonna save you a whole bunch of
03:20 - headaches in the future so we're gonna
03:22 - be building this get what they want
03:23 - function so the first thing I'm gonna do
03:25 - is get what they want
03:28 - function and I probably spot it wrong
03:31 - yep but you know good enough so now
03:33 - remember this function has to return an
03:36 - integer that's going to be either 1 2 3
03:39 - or 4
03:40 - so our turn type is going to be integer
03:41 - now the name is get what they want so
03:44 - just go ahead and copy that and paste
03:46 - that and it's not going to take any
03:47 - parameters we don't have to give any
03:49 - information into it we just want to get
03:51 - information back from it so that's why
03:53 - it's not going to take any parameters so
03:55 - now what we wanted to do is we need a
03:57 - variable to temporarily store one two
04:00 - three or four so we got to make an int
04:02 - variable and we'll just name this choice
04:06 - name or whatever you can name it X if
04:08 - you want really doesn't matter so now
04:10 - what we want to do is we want to output
04:14 - the their choices forum so you know they
04:17 - know whether it enter one two or three
04:18 - or four so just go ahead and make four
04:20 - different see out statements we can make
04:22 - it all in one statement but it would
04:24 - probably look cleaner if it's just four
04:25 - different statements so and the first
04:27 - one we'll just put enter one for just
04:30 - plain items and you probably want to put
04:33 - each of these on a new line so just copy
04:36 - this three more times copy and we'll go
04:41 - ahead and write enter 2 4 2 can be let's
04:45 - say helpful items and this will be the
04:49 - you know candy the soda is that really
04:52 - helpful for a kid I don't think so but
04:54 - in this game it is and 3 will be for the
04:57 - harmful items and this will be like the
05:02 - the ninja they're dirty needles and the
05:05 - what else I put oh yeah meth definitely
05:08 - harmful for a kid and 4 will just be
05:11 - like quit program so whenever they press
05:15 - for the program is going to quit so now
05:17 - what we want to do is we want to allow
05:20 - them to input of course one of those
05:22 - numbers so CIN that's how they get
05:25 - information from the keyboard and
05:26 - whatever number they enter it's going to
05:28 - be stored in the variable choice now all
05:31 - we need to do is take that variable
05:33 - choice and return it in our function so
05:35 - whenever return choice it's going to
05:39 - store that number and what they want so
05:42 - now this got what they want function
05:44 - basically gets a number from from the
05:47 - keyboard and it stores it in a variable
05:48 - what they want so now we have a variable
05:52 - either 1 2 3 or 4 but we didn't do
05:56 - anything with that variable yet and what
05:58 - we want to do is since this program is
06:01 - going to keep running until they hit 4
06:03 - we want to throw pretty much our entire
06:05 - program inside a while loop and this
06:08 - while loop is basically going to say ok
06:10 - keep running this program until they hit
06:13 - the number 4 so we're gonna say alright
06:15 - wow that what they want variable is not
06:20 - equal to the number 4 keep running this
06:23 - program
06:24 - and of course at the end of this at the
06:27 - end of this while loop well let me think
06:29 - actually no okay
06:32 - I'll save that for later on but
06:34 - basically what I'm gonna be doing is
06:36 - this I guess I can throw it in right now
06:37 - at the end of this while loop we want to
06:40 - give them another opportunity to you
06:42 - know get what they want to enter another
06:44 - number so go ahead and copy this and
06:48 - well I guess I can show you guys what's
06:50 - going on right now basically this
06:52 - program is going to run and I didn't
06:55 - prototype it always remember to
06:57 - prototype your functions ladies and
06:58 - gentlemen and whenever you prototype
07:01 - something just copy the header and paste
07:03 - it at the very top and that way whenever
07:05 - your program comes across it like it did
07:07 - right there it's going to know what it
07:10 - is so let me show you guys what's going
07:11 - on so far well the very first thing that
07:14 - we did is we ran this program and it
07:17 - called up this function right here now
07:20 - once it got that function it pretty much
07:22 - took a number from one to three or four
07:24 - and stored it in the variable what they
07:27 - want and we said all right keep calling
07:29 - this function in making equal to store
07:31 - to what they want until they enter four
07:33 - so whenever they run this program
07:35 - they're gonna be able to enter one it's
07:37 - going to do something to it's going to
07:39 - do something three it's going to do
07:40 - something they can enter three hundred
07:42 - times if they want but as soon as they
07:44 - enter for the while loop is going to end
07:46 - and the program is going to quit just
07:48 - like that so we have the basic shell of
07:51 - the program right now we basically are
07:53 - getting a number from them and we're
07:55 - going to keep getting a number from them
07:57 - until they enter four so now with the
08:00 - basic shell done the only thing that we
08:03 - need to do now is whenever they enter
08:05 - one handle that one appropriately and
08:07 - show all the plain objects whenever they
08:09 - enter to handle that appropriately and
08:12 - show all the helpful items whenever an
08:14 - INT will enter three show all the items
08:17 - that are harmful to the character and
08:19 - now that we now have the basic shell we
08:23 - can move on to that but we can't in this
08:24 - story because if I do I'm going to run
08:26 - out of time so copy all this code down
08:29 - make sure you know how this menu
08:32 - function works and also make sure you
08:34 - understand why how we keep looping
08:38 - through dysfunction until they enter the
08:41 - number four and by the way as soon as
08:43 - they enter number four this while loop
08:45 - is going to be false and it quits and as
08:48 - you can see whenever it quits there's no
08:49 - more quote there is no more code after
08:52 - it so the main function ends in our
08:54 - program stops so once you guys
08:56 - understand that you're ready to move on
08:57 - to the next tutorial so thank you guys
08:59 - for watching don't forget subscribe and
09:00 - I'll see you guys in the next video
