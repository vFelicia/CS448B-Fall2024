00:00 - all right guys now I want to talk to you
00:02 - about primes now the definition of a
00:04 - prime is owning two or more points next
00:07 - to each other for example this would be
00:09 - a prime right here and what I did is I
00:12 - set up this is called a perfect Prime
00:15 - when you own a Prime on six consecutive
00:18 - points now as you can see this gives
00:20 - your opponent lots of trouble when
00:22 - trying to escape because there's nothing
00:25 - your opponent can roll to get these
00:27 - chips out of here 1 2 3 4 5 six you have
00:30 - it all blocked off so this is a
00:33 - situation that you typically want to put
00:34 - your opponent in and it's good when you
00:36 - first start out making a lot of points
00:38 - in your home board it gets harder and
00:40 - harder for your opponent to escape so if
00:43 - you can ever set up this position this
00:44 - would be ideal now check this out why is
00:47 - this so useful first of all these
00:49 - Checkers are locked into place until you
00:52 - remove one of these points so what you
00:54 - can essentially do is keep rolling and
00:57 - moving your Checkers around the board
00:59 - around the board
01:00 - and eventually you're probably going to
01:02 - have to remove one of these points which
01:04 - will probably be your seven point right
01:06 - here and even when you remove this and
01:09 - move them up it's still going to be
01:12 - difficult for your opponent's last two
01:13 - Checkers to land on the seven Because
01:15 - unless they roll double sixes and can
01:17 - move them both out at once even if they
01:19 - roll one six and get it out they still
01:22 - leave a blot open to be hit so that's
01:24 - why it's so dangerous for your opponent
01:26 - and so awesome for you to set up these
01:29 - perfect Primes especially if they're in
01:31 - your home board so that is the basics of
01:34 - prime and why it's so useful another
01:36 - thing you want to look out for in primes
01:39 - whenever you see your opponent is
01:41 - building a perfect Prime on their home
01:43 - board remember if one of your Checkers
01:44 - gets hit then this is where they're
01:46 - going to have to come out at so
01:48 - typically what you want to do when you
01:49 - see your opponent setting that up is you
01:52 - want to try to own one of their points
01:54 - in their home boards that way when you
01:56 - got a checker that's hit it gives you a
01:59 - chance to come out in this case on five
02:03 - again if you have a checker that was
02:05 - hit and they own a perfect Prime just
02:08 - like that there's no way that you could
02:10 - come out check that out 1 through six is
02:13 - all blocked so that's why owning a point
02:16 - in your opponent's home board is such a
02:18 - useful technique for blocking off
02:20 - against their perfect Primes
