00:01 - uh obviously you could have a global
00:03 - JavaScript file with uh all your plug-in
00:05 - initial initialization uh another jQuery
00:09 - code uh but for now I'm just going to
00:11 - call this password. JS I'm then going to
00:14 - go ahead and include that as well so
00:16 - password. JS is going to be the file
00:18 - that we actually uh initiate this plugin
00:22 - from so as long as all of these are
00:24 - included in our page we can go ahead and
00:26 - do that so I've included uh a script
00:30 - obviously exactly the same thing with
00:31 - this password. JS file here so now that
00:35 - we've got our plug-in uh available to
00:38 - use on our page and we've got our
00:40 - password. JS file we can go ahead and
00:42 - write our jQuery code in here to
00:44 - initialize this plugin so assuming I
00:48 - don't know how to install this plugin
00:50 - many authors will uh give you some kind
00:52 - of indication of how to use this so
00:54 - you'll see that we have on this page
00:56 - some
00:57 - information uh we can see that all we
00:59 - need to do is create um an input field
01:01 - with a type of password and Supply an ID
01:04 - for this as well so that's the first
01:06 - step that we're going to go ahead and uh
01:08 - carry out so input type equals password
01:13 - and we'll give this an ID of a
01:16 - password so now that we've given this an
01:19 - ID we can use this as we normally would
01:21 - uh other elements in jQuery or other
01:24 - elements in HTML to reference to this
01:27 - and we can use a selector to select this
01:29 - element
01:30 - and then apply the um the plug-in to it
01:33 - so here you can see it's most basic form
01:36 - uh you can you just literally need to
01:38 - select the element which will be a
01:41 - password and then you need to just call
01:43 - this show password here so let's go
01:46 - ahead and do this now remember our ID is
01:48 - a password so in here when we create our
01:51 - selector we want to choose a password
01:55 - and then the call for this plugin is
01:58 - show password now it's extremely
02:00 - important to note that jQuery uh
02:03 - obviously JavaScript as well is K
02:05 - sensitive so we want to ensure that we
02:07 - use a capital A small s and a capital P
02:10 - exactly as stated here and uh earlier I
02:13 - said that this index.php will provide an
02:16 - a demo as well so if you go ahead and
02:18 - you're not too sure or the documentation
02:20 - limited on the website and they do
02:23 - include uh a demo file uh go ahead and
02:25 - open that demo file up and you'll be
02:27 - able to see all the relevant information
02:29 - there
02:30 - so with regards to this now this should
02:32 - be activated so we haven't supplied any
02:34 - options to that but we'll make uh
02:36 - options to this but we'll take a look at
02:38 - that in just a moment so let's go over
02:40 - to our page and press refresh you can
02:42 - now see that we've got our form field
02:44 - that we created earlier and we've got
02:45 - this show password check boox here so
02:48 - obviously to test it's working we want
02:50 - to go ahead and enter a password and
02:52 - click show password uh and it does
02:54 - appear to be working so as well as that
02:58 - uh if we were to go over to the
02:59 - documentation as well we can go ahead
03:02 - and look at some examples given uh this
03:04 - is particularly well document uh
03:06 - documented uh we've got some uh
03:09 - paragraphs here just giving you know a
03:11 - lot as much detail as possible so you
03:13 - can see here we've got a few options
03:15 - that we can uh give
03:17 - this uh for example text and uh that's
03:21 - you know sort of noted here that it
03:22 - would show the custom password text so
03:25 - at the moment on our page it just says
03:27 - show password so for example if we want
03:29 - to change this uh we just take a look at
03:32 - the notation on the website uh so in
03:35 - here we
03:36 - can um specify particular options
03:41 - so uh with regards to this one we would
03:43 - need to supply an element and then the
03:45 - options associated with that element so
03:48 - in this case Checker uh we can change
03:50 - the text so we need to supply Checker
03:52 - and then in Brackets we need to supply
03:54 - any options uh that are available so in
03:57 - here we can go ahead and uh the class
04:00 - Checker contains the following options
04:03 - we can supply text so for example
04:06 - reveal and uh now when we refresh this
04:09 - uh you can see that the text Will oh no
04:11 - hold on let's see what we might have
04:13 - done wrong
04:14 - here there we are so Checker and then
04:17 - we've got a colon and then in Brackets
04:19 - we've got the uh options associated with
04:21 - this particular class so now when we
04:23 - refresh uh it still hasn't
04:26 - worked and that is because sorry not a
04:29 - colon we've got a comma because remember
04:31 - this is the uh the element and this is
04:34 - the op these are the options so finally
04:37 - uh
04:39 - no uh so let's go ahead I think I know
04:41 - what's wrong I think uh I haven't read
04:43 - this properly um yeah okay so uh I've
04:47 - misread it and uh haven't done my
04:49 - research correctly uh but what we're
04:51 - actually going to do here is we are
04:52 - specifying an element that we want to
04:56 - inject um the checkbox into so let's go
05:00 - ahead and create a span just at the end
05:03 - of
05:07 - here and I'll call this
05:09 - checkbox so now in password. JS we can
05:12 - go ahead and say
05:15 - checkbox text reveal and that
05:18 - should give us that option there okay so
05:21 - uh another probably point now to make is
05:23 - actually read the uh text rather than
05:26 - just looking at the options so now that
05:28 - we've done that we have uh supplied the
05:31 - checkbox uh class which I've assigned to
05:34 - this span just here um with the text
05:37 - reveal and we've we've given the we've
05:40 - put the text box into this uh span here
05:43 - uh and then just specified a particular
05:45 - option so that covers just installing uh
05:48 - a very basic uh jQuery plug-in um we've
05:51 - already spoken about why we use plugins
05:53 - but things like this um obviously are
05:57 - useful um and uh and a relatively small
06:01 - in file size we saw in in our archive
06:04 - earlier that we've got a 1.7 KB file so
06:07 - you're looking at something that's uh
06:10 - you know quite quick to run and uh the
06:12 - benefit of this is we have a minified
06:14 - and compressed version as well
