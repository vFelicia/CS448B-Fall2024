00:00 - all right guys welcome to your seventh
00:02 - udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - going to be talking to you guys about
00:05 - brushes now a brush is a way you can
00:08 - create very basic shapes using the udk
00:11 - I'm talking about cubes spheres cones
00:15 - cylinders I'm going to be teaching you
00:16 - guys how to create very basic shapes now
00:19 - before I even get started with this
00:20 - tutorial I want to mention this I'm not
00:22 - going to be going over the rest of the
00:24 - interface like I did with the viewport
00:26 - options and the reason behind that is
00:28 - all of these options are pretty Advanced
00:31 - options we are nowhere near learning
00:33 - this stuff yet so instead of you know
00:36 - jumping into the most advanced stuff
00:37 - first and foremost and instead of
00:40 - overwhelming you guys with stuff that
00:41 - would just confuse you what I'm going to
00:43 - be doing instead is I'm going to be
00:45 - learning these options as we go along it
00:48 - it's much more natural and it'll make a
00:50 - lot more sense to learn everything piece
00:52 - by piece instead of throwing everything
00:54 - at you guys at once so that's why I'm
00:56 - not going to be going over these buttons
00:58 - a lot of them are actually so
01:00 - explanatory like save save as um cut and
01:03 - copy but with all this advanced stuff up
01:05 - here I'm going to be waiting until the
01:07 - time is right to cover that stuff so
01:09 - don't freak out don't think you missed
01:10 - the video or anything that's what I'm
01:12 - going to be doing so with that being
01:14 - said now is the time that I give you
01:16 - guys the introduction to brushes now
01:19 - these are your brushes over here and by
01:21 - the way let me mention this whoever
01:23 - named these things brushes they didn't
01:25 - do the best job naming these they
01:27 - probably should have named them shapes
01:29 - or something because whenever I think of
01:31 - brushes I think of Photoshop or you know
01:33 - just me painting a house me wiping a
01:36 - brush with paint on it all these are are
01:39 - basically shapes so whenever I say brush
01:41 - just think in your head shape so the
01:44 - core tutorial behind how you create a
01:47 - basic shape is this you go ahead and you
01:50 - pick pick your shape right here and then
01:52 - whenever you pick your shape you're
01:54 - going to get a red wireframe that's what
01:57 - these lines are called a wireframe it's
01:58 - basically an outline of your shape so if
02:01 - you went ahead and you picked a
02:02 - staircase it would be in the shape of a
02:04 - staircase so let's go ahead and stick
02:06 - with cube right here and now our red
02:08 - wireframe is going to be in the shape of
02:10 - a cube so you basically pick your shape
02:13 - and then you go ahead down here to
02:15 - CSG now CSG the technical term for it is
02:20 - constructive solid geometry again
02:23 - probably the same person named this
02:25 - named brushes because it's not the best
02:27 - name you can give a user it's basically
02:31 - mass or a solid object so let's go ahead
02:34 - down here and click CSG add and whenever
02:36 - we click that we're basically telling
02:38 - the udk add a solid object in the shape
02:42 - of this brush to our screen so go ahead
02:44 - and click that and as you can see we now
02:47 - have a solid object a
02:49 - cube pretty cool huh so that's the
02:52 - basics of how you create simple shapes
02:54 - go ahead and select your shape and click
02:57 - CSG add simple enough enough so now with
03:01 - that being said let me tell you guys how
03:03 - you can move these brushes or red wire
03:05 - frame shapes around the screen up here
03:08 - at the very top of the udk are your
03:11 - transform tools now the select tool
03:14 - we'll start with that the select tool
03:16 - goes ahead and it selects one of your
03:17 - shapes so if I want to select this Cube
03:20 - I'm just going to go ahead and click on
03:21 - the cube now this next tool right here
03:24 - is probably the tool you're going to use
03:25 - most often that's the translation modood
03:27 - mode and that's how you move your basic
03:30 - shape so go ahead and click that and
03:32 - you're going to get three arrows one
03:34 - moves them in the x- axis one y and one
03:37 - Z so go ahead and click and hold the
03:41 - Green Arrow and as you can see whenever
03:43 - we move it it just moves it around it's
03:46 - basically your move tool that's what I'm
03:47 - going to be calling it probably your
03:49 - move tool so go ahead and uh practice
03:51 - moving your box around and there you go
03:55 - now this next one right here is rotation
03:57 - and that does exactly like you think I
03:59 - don't have to explain to you guys what
04:00 - rotation is pretty much takes your box
04:03 - and rotates it however you want
04:06 - it pretty cool huh and this next one
04:09 - right here is a scaling mode now you
04:11 - have two different scaling modes this
04:13 - first one is the uniform scaling if you
04:15 - go ahead and click and drag then your
04:18 - cube is going to scale uniformly and by
04:20 - that I mean every axis is going to scale
04:23 - at the same rate now if you want to only
04:25 - stretch it in One Direction then you
04:27 - need to use this right here non-un form
04:30 - scaling whenever you click that you can
04:32 - pull it and only stretches it or scales
04:34 - it in One
04:35 - Direction so with those let's see how
04:38 - many with those five tools we can
04:40 - basically get any shape Cube we want and
04:43 - we can rotate it and move it any place
04:45 - we want so that is the basics of how you
04:48 - create a basic shape and the different
04:51 - transform tools that you can use in
04:53 - order to customize your shape so in the
04:55 - next tutorial I'm going to be talking
04:56 - more about brushes in some other
04:58 - nitty-gritty details with them but for
05:00 - now that's all you guys get so thank you
05:02 - guys for watching don't forget to
