00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to continue
00:07 - working on our person program using
00:10 - classes now if you don't know what
00:12 - you're looking at right now you may want
00:14 - to move back a couple couple tutorials
00:16 - to um the introduction to classes and
00:19 - that is when we get started on this
00:20 - program uh if you don't want to then uh
00:23 - that's fine you can just go ahead and
00:24 - try to figure out what's going on so if
00:26 - you remember last time we um set the
00:32 - weight money and income label we set
00:34 - that text uh to whatever the person's
00:37 - weight money and income is and then we
00:39 - added the uh button eat click event so
00:42 - they will eat 5 lounds of food and they
00:44 - will gain um 5 lbs and then it updates
00:49 - their current weight so now let's go
00:50 - ahead and do this for each of the uh
00:54 - other um buttons so we'll type my
01:00 - person. work and the arguments of this
01:03 - is hours as double so let's say he just
01:06 - works 8
01:08 - hours now we need to update the um the
01:13 - label
01:15 - so label
01:17 - weight I mean label um money. text
01:24 - equals current
01:26 - money and we'll go ahead and add my
01:30 - person.get
01:32 - money and we'll convert that to a
01:35 - string and you can see that if we go
01:37 - ahead and run
01:38 - this we get an if we click work our
01:42 - money goes up to
01:44 - $158 because
01:46 - $725 time 8 is $58 and each time we work
01:51 - we get more money and now we can eat and
01:54 - gain five pounds each time so now let's
01:57 - go ahead and do this for the increased
01:59 - income and the exercise so we go ahead
02:02 - and click on exercise and we'll type my
02:05 - person. exercise and the arguments for
02:08 - this is time as double so let's just say
02:11 - exercise uh 1 and 1 half hours and we'll
02:15 - type label
02:18 - weight dot text and we'll set that equal
02:24 - to current
02:27 - weight and we'll go ahead and
02:31 - add my person.get
02:34 - weight and then we'll go ahead and
02:36 - convert that to a
02:38 - string and we'll do that one more time
02:40 - for The increased income so we'll go
02:43 - ahead and type my person
02:46 - do increase income and the arguments for
02:48 - this is amount as double so let's just
02:51 - pay him $25 more per hour and we'll type
02:54 - label
02:56 - income. text
02:58 - equals current
03:01 - income and then we'll go ahead and
03:04 - add my person.get
03:08 - income and then we'll convert that to a
03:11 - string so now if we run this let's go
03:15 - ahead and have our person eat some and
03:18 - get pretty fat let's say uh we want them
03:20 - to
03:22 - be 193 lb now if they exercise an hour
03:26 - and a half it's going to go down to 1928
03:30 - 5
03:31 - 192.5 and if they just keep exercising
03:34 - they're going to lose weight now let's
03:35 - have our person work so they're making
03:38 - $58 um per per8 hour time period now and
03:41 - if we increase their income you can see
03:43 - that their income goes up to $9.75 cents
03:46 - per hour and they're making more money
03:47 - per hour now this may not be noticeable
03:50 - um at first glance but let's say I bump
03:53 - up their current income to $42 an hour
03:56 - you can see their current money will go
03:58 - up all the way up to
04:00 - 768 so we can keep exercising we can
04:03 - keep eating and getting fatter and then
04:05 - exercising trying to get that off um so
04:08 - now now let's come down here and so we
04:11 - don't have to type the
04:14 - um all of this out on one uh line let's
04:18 - go ahead and make a sub that will update
04:21 - the text so we'll just do private
04:27 - sub update
04:32 - income and what I just realized is we
04:35 - don't have to add current income right
04:37 - here we can just add my person.get
04:38 - income so it's not resetting this whole
04:41 - thing each time so we'll just
04:45 - type uh label
04:47 - income. text plus equals my
04:52 - person. get income and then we'll
04:55 - convert that to a string so it takes
04:57 - what's already in there and um
05:00 - it will add their income or wait never
05:04 - mind that's going to add more lines of
05:06 - their income so we'll just set it equal
05:08 - to current
05:11 - income and then we'll add uh my person
05:15 - my person.get income and I'll do this
05:17 - for each one of them so private
05:21 - sub update
05:25 - weight and let's come up here to the
05:28 - weight so label weight. text TT we'll
05:31 - copy
05:32 - that and we'll come down here and paste
05:35 - that in so we'll do it one more time for
05:39 - update um income or not income let's do
05:44 - update
05:46 - money so we'll go ahead and
05:50 - type private
05:53 - sub update
05:55 - money and we'll go ahead and find our
05:57 - money here so label money. text equals
06:02 - current money uh plus my person.get
06:05 - money. twring and we will paste that
06:08 - down in
06:10 - here okay so now let's go ahead we can
06:12 - minimize out of each of these Subs
06:14 - because we're not going to make any
06:15 - changes to them and let's go ahead and
06:17 - just type update money right
06:21 - here and let's do update weight right
06:27 - here and in down here we will update the
06:37 - income and up here we will update the
06:44 - weight okay so now let's go ahead and
06:46 - run this and it should work just the
06:48 - same as it did last time but now we have
06:51 - uh easier to use code and we can just
06:53 - call subs and um which makes it a lot
06:56 - easier to write our code and make it go
06:58 - faster so we can eat and gain weight and
07:01 - then we can exercise and lose that
07:03 - weight we can work to make more money
07:06 - and then we can get promoted to uh make
07:08 - a higher
07:10 - income so go ahead and uh if you haven't
07:14 - typed this code in go ahead and do that
07:15 - you can even add I encourage you to add
07:17 - text Fields so that you can get values
07:19 - to um exercise or to work or to um
07:23 - update the income so that it's not a
07:25 - default value uh and then once you've
07:27 - done that and once you understand what
07:28 - we're doing I'll go ahead and move on to
07:30 - the next tutorial and thanks for
07:32 - watching
