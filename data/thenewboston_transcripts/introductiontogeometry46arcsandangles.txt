00:02 - So today we're talking about arcs and
00:05 - angles of a
00:08 - circle so first there are three types of
00:12 - arcs we have a what's called a
00:15 - semicircle which is Arc P RH and you
00:19 - have to go in the order of points so you
00:23 - start with P you go to R you go to H and
00:28 - that's half a rotation of a circle which
00:32 - is equal to
00:33 - 180° so a semicircle is always equal to
00:38 - 180° an arc of 180° that's not the
00:42 - length of it length of it that's just
00:44 - how how this Arc is a major arc is
00:50 - greater than half a rotation so if I go
00:53 - to
00:55 - P to
00:57 - H to m
01:01 - see how this Arc is bigger than this
01:04 - semicircle Arc so that's called a major
01:07 - arc and a minor
01:09 - Arc and a minor Arc is less than half a
01:13 - rotation so it's less than
01:16 - 180° so this Arc we have right here
01:19 - would be Arc
01:20 - CH or you
01:22 - can do HC it doesn't matter so this Arc
01:27 - right
01:28 - here Which is less than a semicircle
01:34 - Arc so now we have what's called a
01:36 - central angle and a central angle has
01:40 - its vertex at the center of a circle and
01:43 - its measure is equal to the measure of
01:46 - its minor Arc so if this
01:50 - angle equals 50° then this Arc right
01:56 - here and it's a minor Arc because it's
02:00 - um less than half a
02:03 - rotation so the measure of Arc l
02:07 - k is
02:09 - 50° now that only works with central
02:12 - angles so don't try and use that
02:15 - principle for any other kind of angle
02:17 - only a central
02:19 - angle so now we're going to find the
02:21 - indicated measures so they want the
02:24 - measure of Arc C D or
02:28 - DC so since we
02:32 - know we know that b is the center of the
02:38 - circle
02:40 - so this angle
02:44 - DBC is a central angle so that means
02:48 - this Arc is equal to the measure of the
02:50 - central angle so Arc DC is equal to
02:55 - 51° now they want the measure of
02:58 - DB which is
03:02 - this Arc right
03:06 - here
03:08 - now if you think about it this line
03:12 - right
03:13 - here DB is the diameter of the circle so
03:18 - if I go from D all the way to the other
03:21 - side of the circle on B I've completed
03:24 - half of
03:25 - rotation so this um Arc right here is a
03:30 - semicircle so that means its measure has
03:33 - to be
03:35 - 180° now they want me to find this
03:40 - part just this section of the arc Arc
03:45 - CB
03:46 - well if you remember those rules we had
03:49 - about segments where you could add the
03:52 - parts to find the total or subtract one
03:55 - of the parts to find the other part well
03:57 - we can do the same thing here since this
04:00 - Big Arc C
04:03 - DB is
04:05 - 180° and this smaller Arc right here is
04:09 - 51° we can minus 51° from 80° to find
04:14 - out what just this Arc equals so we're
04:17 - just going to call that X so
04:19 - 180° minus
04:22 - 51° is
04:24 - 129 degrees so the Arc Length of CB or
04:29 - the Arc of CB is 129
04:34 - degrees now they want this Arc right
04:38 - here
04:41 - a well if you look c b c is a DBC is a
04:49 - central angle a
04:52 - b
04:57 - oh that should have been Point e right
05:02 - there let me just change that I had two
05:05 - point B's for a
05:07 - second okay so we want so DBC is a
05:13 - central angle and ab e is a central
05:16 - angle so that means that this Arc is
05:19 - equal to this angle well if you look at
05:21 - these two angles right here they are
05:24 - vertical angles and if you remember our
05:27 - rule about vertical angles they have the
05:29 - same measure so the measure of this
05:31 - angle is
05:34 - 51° now because this is a central angle
05:37 - that must mean that the measure of AE is
05:40 - also
05:43 - 51°
05:44 - now they want us to find the measure of
05:49 - [Music]
05:51 - Da
05:52 - so we're going to do the same thing we
05:55 - did to find the measure of C
06:01 - e so
06:04 - da is part of this Big Arc de which is
06:09 - equal to
06:11 - 180° so we can take 180° minus this
06:15 - piece right here which is
06:18 - 51° and we'll get
06:22 - 129° equals
06:25 - x which makes sense if you think about
06:27 - it because these two angles right here
06:30 - are also vertical angles so they have to
06:32 - have the same
06:35 - measure so that's all we're going to do
06:38 - with arcs and angles
06:41 - today but make sure you come
06:44 - back when we talk about other kinds of
06:48 - angles of a
06:51 - circle
