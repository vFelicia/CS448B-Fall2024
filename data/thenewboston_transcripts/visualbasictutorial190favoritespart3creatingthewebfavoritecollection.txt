00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to continue
00:07 - working on the favorites viewer now
00:11 - before we get started I just wanted to
00:13 - say um like I do in every single
00:14 - tutorial um where I don't where I use a
00:16 - program that isn't made by me um all the
00:19 - credit goes to the authors of beginning
00:21 - Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 um the
00:23 - authors are theoren Willis and Brian
00:25 - Newsome they created this great program
00:27 - that I'm using um to teach you guys um
00:30 - some objectoriented programming
00:32 - techniques and I'm going to explain it
00:33 - to you um in a lot of detail and you
00:36 - don't have to have the book
00:37 - yourself so if you don't know what you
00:40 - see right here and you don't know what
00:41 - that is then you may want to move back
00:43 - to one of the previous
00:45 - tutorials so we'll go ahead and let's
00:48 - create a 4 each
00:50 - Loop that will process each line in our
00:54 - file so we'll start off by typing for
00:58 - each and we're going to do we're going
01:00 - to use string
01:01 - line in string lines so basically what
01:06 - we're saying is for each of the lines in
01:08 - our array of lines so we've got our file
01:13 - and we split it up into separate lines
01:15 - for each line in there what do we want
01:17 - to do well we want to search for our URL
01:21 - so we can use a simple if statement so
01:24 - if String Line do
01:27 - starts with now this is pretty
01:29 - self-explanatory determines whether the
01:31 - beginning of the string instance match
01:33 - matches the specified string so if it
01:35 - starts with
01:37 - URL
01:39 - equals then what do we want to do we
01:42 - want to set URL equal
01:45 - to string line do
01:49 - substring at index of
01:53 - four
01:54 - so and if this happens we just want to
01:57 - exit our for Loop because we have found
02:00 - what we're looking for and we don't need
02:01 - to go through the rest of the for Loop
02:03 - so what this does is it checks to see if
02:06 - the line starts with URL or URL equals
02:09 - and after URL equals it's going to
02:11 - contain uh the URL of the website that's
02:14 - our favorite so what we do is we set URL
02:18 - which is a public variable um it's a
02:20 - string we're going to set that equal to
02:23 - the line at substring and we start at
02:26 - index 4 so we have index 0 1 2 3 and
02:30 - start at index 4 so it's going to set
02:32 - our URL to the URL that we want and it's
02:35 - going to leave out URL equals right here
02:37 - because we're starting at index
02:40 - 4 now let's go ahead and we need to read
02:46 - the uh the file or the um data that's in
02:51 - the file I don't know how I forgot this
02:53 - in the last tutorial but we're going to
02:55 - set string data equal to my do computer
03:00 - computer. fil
03:02 - system. readall text and we're reading
03:05 - all the text from the file name which
03:08 - has been passed to this
03:12 - method so let's just enclose all of this
03:16 - in a tri triy block so we're going to
03:20 - try and if for some reason we get an
03:23 - error in here let's go ahead and catch
03:25 - it now we're going to catch an error um
03:29 - of type IO exception so if we get an
03:33 - error reading or writing or something um
03:36 - then it's going to catch
03:38 - that so whenever we catch that we'll
03:40 - just show it so messagebox messagebox
03:44 - Dosh show ex.
03:48 - message okay so now that we've created
03:51 - our um web favorites class um remember
03:55 - to put this line in right here that I
03:56 - forgot from the previous tutorial which
03:58 - basically reads the lines reads all the
04:01 - text of the file into string
04:04 - data so now what we need to do is we
04:09 - need to continue uh by creating a
04:12 - another
04:13 - class so we'll come over here to
04:16 - favorites viewer YouTube we'll right
04:19 - click and we will add another
04:23 - class now let me go ahead and Shrink
04:25 - this
04:27 - down now this class is going to be
04:29 - called
04:30 - web favorite
04:33 - collection now this is going to hold
04:35 - objects um for each of our favorites
04:38 - that um has that have been read from our
04:41 - computer so what we need to do is type
04:44 - inherits collection base now it says
04:47 - provides the abstract Base Class for a
04:49 - strongly typed collection so what this
04:51 - means is that it's a collection and we
04:55 - can store a bunch of objects in it now
04:59 - um we're going to be storing objects of
05:01 - type web favorite now you said it you
05:04 - saw it said um strongly typed collection
05:07 - and what it means by that is that you
05:08 - can only use a certain type of data in
05:10 - it and it's whatever you specify so
05:13 - whenever we inherit from collection base
05:15 - we need to add some stuff to the class
05:18 - so we need to add a method called
05:21 - add so this is going to take an argument
05:26 - and we'll call it favorite as web
05:30 - favorite so it's going to be a type web
05:32 - favorite which is this class that we've
05:33 - created right
05:36 - here so whenever they add we want to add
05:39 - the item to the collection so we'll just
05:41 - type
05:42 - list.
05:44 - add
05:46 - favorite now you may be you may be
05:48 - wondering where we got list from well
05:51 - list is what this class uses to store um
05:54 - all of its items or its objects because
05:57 - it inherits from collection based we can
05:58 - use list so the list in this class is
06:01 - going to store all of our objects now we
06:04 - need to create a remove method so Public
06:07 - Sub
06:08 - remove and this is going to take an
06:11 - argument of an index so we want to
06:13 - remove something at a certain
06:16 - index so we'll type if index is greater
06:22 - than or equal to zero and
06:25 - index is less than count you can see
06:29 - that counts gets the number of elements
06:31 - contained in the collection based
06:33 - instance so if it's less than the uh
06:37 - number of items in our list then we can
06:40 - go ahead and remove
06:42 - it so the um list starts at index zero
06:48 - and then it has a certain count so if
06:50 - the index isn't outside of these bounds
06:52 - then we can go ahead and type
06:55 - list.
06:57 - remove and this is going to take an
07:01 - argument so we'll just
07:05 - type
07:09 - index so now what we need to do is we
07:13 - need to come down below in
07:15 - sub and we'll type
07:17 - public readon property so we're making a
07:20 - readon property now here's something I
07:24 - just uh realized the writers of this
07:27 - book have messed up they took an index
07:33 - for the argument of this but when they
07:35 - removed they removed they used remove
07:38 - and used an index and it will never find
07:41 - that because when it tries to remove
07:43 - it'll look at that number and be like
07:44 - well there's nothing in here um with
07:46 - that value so we're not remove it so we
07:49 - need to use list. remove at
07:52 - index so we'll create a readon property
07:56 - called
07:57 - item and it's going to take an argument
08:00 - byal index as integer so whenever they
08:04 - access the item property they're going
08:06 - to have to put an index in as the
08:09 - integer and it's going to give them back
08:12 - um the item at that index and we want to
08:16 - make it of type web favorite because
08:19 - this collection holds uh a whole bunch
08:21 - of web favorite
08:23 - objects so what we want to do is we want
08:25 - to give them back an uh an item from our
08:29 - colle ction or our list um based on what
08:32 - its index is so we want to return and we
08:36 - want to use C type because we're going
08:38 - to be converting um object
08:40 - types so we'll type
08:44 - list. item at
08:49 - index and we want to convert that to
08:51 - type web
08:54 - favorite so what does is it's going to
08:57 - return a value and it's going to take
08:59 - the value at in our list which is our
09:03 - collection that we have for this class
09:05 - at the item at the index of the index
09:08 - that they gave us so let's say we've got
09:10 - a web favorite at index of five and it's
09:13 - equal to um to YouTube so it's going to
09:16 - get the item at index to five and it's
09:19 - going to be YouTube and it's going to
09:21 - convert that to type web favorite now
09:23 - because it's already a web favorite we
09:25 - will have no problems with converting it
09:26 - to web favorite and it'll work just fine
09:30 - so go ahead put this code in if you
09:32 - haven't um if you're confused with
09:34 - anything leave it in the comments maybe
09:36 - somebody will be able to help you um I
09:38 - might even be able to monitor the
09:40 - comments and see if people need help so
09:43 - thanks for watching and stay tuned for
09:44 - the next tutorial
