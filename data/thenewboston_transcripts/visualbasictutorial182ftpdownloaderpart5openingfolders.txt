00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - continue working on our FTP downloader
00:09 - now as you saw right there I'm actually
00:11 - installing the UDK right now because
00:14 - I've been watching
00:15 - Bucky's videos and I decided I wanted to
00:18 - learn how to do that so if you guys
00:20 - haven't seen those videos yet and you're
00:22 - interested in developing games then you
00:24 - may want to go check out his tutorials
00:26 - on the UDK so let's go ahead and we'll
00:30 - come back in here and let's see what's
00:32 - next on our list of things to do so
00:35 - we've got update server we'll get to
00:38 - that later we've done home directory and
00:40 - we've done download so now let's do open
00:43 - folder so in order for us to open a
00:46 - folder we're gonna go ahead we're gonna
00:48 - go ahead and open up the selected index
00:50 - change for the list FTP files so let's
00:55 - use a simple if statement so if list FTP
01:00 - files dot selected item
01:05 - dot contains or we cannot use contains
01:10 - here so what we're going to need to do
01:12 - is create a variable to store that item
01:14 - in so we'll just come right in but it
01:18 - and we will declare a variable so then
01:21 - folder name as string and we'll set it
01:25 - equal to list a TV files dot selected
01:29 - item ok so let's go ahead and get rid of
01:33 - this right here
01:34 - so if folder name dot contains so if it
01:42 - contains a value so it contains a period
01:46 - in it then what do you want to do well
01:50 - we don't want it to do anything if
01:52 - there's a period and let me just go in
01:53 - and get this out of the way so what we
01:58 - can do is we can do if they start here
02:00 - and then just add an else right after
02:01 - that that's not very efficient so we'll
02:05 - do if not
02:09 - click allow access to get him so if
02:14 - folder name does not contain a period
02:16 - then we'll go ahead and change the
02:20 - directory so in order for us to do this
02:24 - we're gonna have to create a bullying so
02:27 - we'll come up here and we'll do private
02:29 - is folder as bullying now let's set it
02:34 - equal to false so if it doesn't contain
02:39 - a period which pretty much means it's a
02:41 - folder because I'll follow all file
02:43 - types have a period so dot X dot bat dot
02:46 - exe whatever you want those are all
02:48 - gonna have a period in it and folders
02:50 - will not so if it doesn't contain a
02:52 - period then is folder it's gonna be
02:54 - equal to true and now let's do else so
02:59 - if it does have a period then is folder
03:02 - is gonna be equal to false so
03:08 - it is folder is equal to true then we
03:10 - want to go ahead and enable that button
03:12 - so button open folder or let's see what
03:17 - it is button change directory which I
03:21 - don't know why I named it that but
03:23 - button change directory dot enabled
03:25 - equals true and then we'll do button
03:30 - change directory dot enabled equals
03:34 - false so if it's a folder then they can
03:37 - change the directory but if it's not
03:39 - then they can not change them to
03:41 - directory so now what we need to do is
03:44 - access the click event for open folder
03:46 - so we don't have to put any if
03:49 - statements in here because we've already
03:52 - enabled and disabled it based on if the
03:55 - fog if it's a file or a folder so if
03:58 - it's a folder then it'll allow us it
04:00 - will allow us to click it so what would
04:03 - it go ahead and do is we will set FTP
04:08 - downloader dot current directory and
04:13 - we'll just go ahead and plus equals and
04:17 - we'll add
04:19 - list FTP files that selected item and
04:23 - then we'll just add a forward slash so
04:26 - what this is gonna do is it's going to
04:29 - have the forward slash that is already
04:31 - there which is right here then it's
04:33 - gonna be in the folder of the selected
04:35 - item then it's gonna add another slash
04:37 - right there so by adding this forward
04:40 - slash right here we only have to do this
04:42 - once so it adds that and it adds another
04:44 - forward slash so that we can keep going
04:45 - into more and more folders so it's going
04:48 - to add this string to the directory so
04:51 - now I need to do is we need to refresh
04:54 - the list so refresh list now let's go
05:00 - ahead and run this
05:03 - and I believe I have a folder in here so
05:07 - you can see we've got application files
05:09 - which is a folder hi which is a folder
05:11 - and then all these that have periods in
05:14 - them are files so you can see when I
05:15 - click on these we can't do anything with
05:17 - them but when I click on hi we can open
05:19 - that folder so for the current directory
05:22 - we have an updated that yet so we've got
05:24 - hi there dot txt so we can go back to
05:29 - the home directory and we can open
05:30 - application files open that folder and
05:33 - then we can view files that are in there
05:36 - so let's go ahead and we can open this
05:38 - folder again - so we got hello world
05:41 - application Exe dot deployed and
05:43 - manifest so you can see we can go into
05:47 - as many folders as we weren't so now
05:49 - what we want to do is we want to change
05:51 - this based on the directory so let's go
05:54 - ahead and create a sub and we'll do
05:57 - private sub update directory and we'll
06:02 - just do update directory label so now I
06:05 - need to do is label directory dot text
06:10 - now let's go ahead and add + equals I
06:15 - believe we'll need to space
06:19 - and then we will do FTP downloader dot
06:23 - current directory so it's going to get
06:26 - the current directory that's in there
06:28 - so whenever the form loes what we want
06:30 - to do is we'll just actually we haven't
06:35 - opened Indian directories yet so when
06:37 - they go to home directory we will do
06:40 - update let's see what did I call that
06:46 - directory label so update directory
06:51 - label and whenever they change the
06:54 - directory we want to call that again
06:56 - so update directory label so we'll go
07:00 - ahead and run this you can see let me
07:04 - click home directory we get current
07:06 - directory and a forward slash now let's
07:08 - go ahead and we can open application
07:10 - files and we get application files here
07:13 - now you can see that we have a little
07:16 - problem here it has application files
07:18 - and then it adds it there so let's go
07:21 - ahead and fix that so we don't want we
07:24 - don't want it to be plus because when we
07:27 - want to set it equal to and then we'll
07:29 - just say
07:32 - current directory okay so now if we run
07:38 - this we go to our home directory and we
07:42 - get current directory in the forward
07:44 - slash we can open this folder and you
07:47 - see it gives us our directory we can go
07:49 - back to the home directory and keep
07:51 - opening folders and you can see that
07:54 - it'll add it right here now let's go
07:57 - ahead and close out of this so go ahead
08:00 - and put in this code to change the
08:02 - directory and update the directory label
08:06 - and then once you've done that and you
08:09 - understand what's going on move on to
08:11 - the next tutorial
