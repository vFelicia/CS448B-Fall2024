00:00 - what is going on guys my name is Bucky
00:02 - Roberts and welcome to your very first
00:04 - react tutorial now question number one
00:07 - what the heck is react react is a
00:10 - JavaScript library for building user
00:12 - interfaces specifically single page
00:15 - applications now what I was going to do
00:18 - is I was going to kind of tell you guys
00:19 - the history about react and go into a
00:22 - bunch of details show you guys a bunch
00:23 - of demos but then I was like let's just
00:25 - go ahead and instead of looking at demos
00:27 - let's just get our hands dirty and start
00:28 - making them so so what do we need to get
00:30 - started with react well the very first
00:33 - and probably most important thing we
00:34 - need is the react Library so this is the
00:37 - code for the library and this is
00:40 - actually made by Facebook so if you ever
00:42 - go to this website and you're like
00:43 - facebook. GitHub what the heck this
00:45 - entire library was created by Facebook
00:47 - so that's some background information
00:50 - but essentially we need these two files
00:52 - react.js and
00:54 - react.js now we have a couple options of
00:58 - how we can include these into our HTML
01:01 - what we can do is we can just go ahead
01:03 - and copy this and then plop them right
01:06 - in here just like you include any CSS or
01:08 - JavaScript file or what you can do is
01:11 - you can actually download these and have
01:13 - them stored on your own machine now the
01:16 - benefit of kind of just including them
01:18 - from here is you don't have a bunch of
01:20 - files on your own computer now the
01:23 - benefit of having them on your computer
01:25 - is of course what happens whenever your
01:27 - internet goes out and you suddenly
01:29 - become in the mood to rate react well
01:31 - you can't because you're not connected
01:33 - and you can't get these files anymore so
01:36 - if you guys want to kind of do it this
01:39 - way then feel free but my setup and what
01:42 - I did is I actually have them downloaded
01:44 - on my own system and just to make it
01:46 - easier for you guys if you go to this Ur
01:49 - URL right here and this is just my
01:52 - GitHub page um I already downloaded all
01:54 - the files as well as some additional
01:56 - ones that we're going to need
01:58 - so I'll show you guys what to do if you
02:00 - just go here clone or download and hit
02:03 - download zip then it's going to give you
02:05 - all the files and once you extract it is
02:08 - going to give you this right here all of
02:10 - these juicy files so from there what I
02:13 - did is I went in demos I made a new
02:15 - directory called Simple demo and I made
02:17 - a really basic HTML file and as you can
02:20 - see I already included all the
02:22 - JavaScript we need which is right in
02:24 - here so you guys are looking at this and
02:27 - you're like all right so you said that
02:28 - we need the react react Dom JS but what
02:32 - the heck is this file you told me that
02:34 - we only needed these two JavaScript
02:35 - files so what is this third one are you
02:37 - lying to me Bucky well believe it or not
02:40 - whenever we write react even though that
02:43 - this is a JavaScript library we're not
02:44 - going to be writing plain old JavaScript
02:47 - we're going to be using a flavor of
02:48 - JavaScript called jsx so why are we
02:51 - doing this instead of writing plain old
02:53 - JavaScript well even though your browser
02:56 - needs plain old JavaScript whenever we
02:58 - write jsx we have some really cool
03:01 - features for example we can basically
03:04 - write this code that looks exactly like
03:07 - HTML and if you guys ever tried to do
03:09 - this with play Old JavaScript it's a
03:10 - pain in the butt so whenever we write
03:13 - jsx it's just really intuitive and easy
03:16 - to understand and learn um react however
03:19 - like I said whenever you run this in a
03:22 - browser your browser cannot understand
03:24 - jsx it can only understand JavaScript so
03:27 - what we need to do before we actually
03:29 - run it is we need a tool to convert it
03:32 - to Plano JavaScript so again this is
03:34 - what we're going to be writing on the
03:35 - left called jsx and after we run our
03:39 - translator it's actually called a
03:41 - transpiler um it converts it to plain
03:43 - old JavaScript and you can just use a
03:45 - tool like this one
03:47 - online to do it all for you or you can
03:50 - just go ahead and include this link
03:52 - right here which basically takes care of
03:53 - all of that behind the scenes so we can
03:56 - write jsx right in here run it and it's
03:58 - going to be beautiful our browser is
04:00 - going to understand it we're going to be
04:01 - able to write jsx it's going to be
04:03 - awesome so with that being said let's go
04:06 - ahead and get started
