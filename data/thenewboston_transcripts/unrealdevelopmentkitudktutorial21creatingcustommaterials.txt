00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 21st udk
00:03 - tutorial and now that we know what
00:05 - collections are let's go ahead and learn
00:07 - about packages so in this tutorial what
00:10 - I'm going to be doing is I'm going to
00:11 - show you guys how to create your own
00:13 - custom packages and how to add things
00:16 - inside them like materials and stuff so
00:18 - let's go ahead and actually create one
00:20 - right now and before I get started I
00:21 - want to say this when people typically
00:24 - make packages they typically like to
00:26 - group similar objects in packages for
00:28 - example they want a packages a package
00:30 - of sounds or a package of materials or
00:34 - static meshes what we're going to be
00:36 - doing is since we already know what
00:37 - materials are let's go ahead and make a
00:39 - package for materials so in order to
00:42 - make a new package can you guess what
00:43 - one yep create new asset and this is
00:46 - going to allow you to create a new
00:48 - package so the package name I'm just
00:50 - going to name mine my package sounds
00:52 - kind of kind of dumb so um
00:57 - bies awesome
01:00 - package that kind of sounds sexual but I
01:03 - kind of like it at the same time so
01:05 - grouping a group is pretty much it's
01:09 - like a way of organizing all your stuff
01:11 - so go ahead and just type materials it's
01:13 - not that important uh your name just go
01:16 - ahead and this is actually going to be
01:18 - the name of your material itself so I'm
01:20 - just going to name on like crappy
01:23 - material 01 and for your factory you
01:27 - need to select what you're going to be
01:29 - storing storing in your package and of
01:31 - course if I can find it material right
01:33 - here so this crappy material one is a
01:36 - name for a material so go ahead and
01:38 - click okay and now when you do first you
01:41 - get this material editor that pops up
01:43 - and we're going to go ahead and X out of
01:45 - that for now because we're not ready for
01:46 - that yet the material editor is where
01:49 - you make your material but like I said
01:51 - we're not ready for that yet so by
01:53 - default whenever we hit okay the
01:57 - material editor pops up and behind that
01:59 - it took us to our package so as you can
02:01 - see in new packages right here we got a
02:04 - package called Buy's awesome package and
02:07 - our group is materials and inside our
02:09 - group we have our material which is
02:11 - called crappy material and by the way
02:14 - this little asteris next to Bucky's
02:16 - awesome package means that you created a
02:18 - package with a material in it but you
02:20 - didn't save it yet so make sure you go
02:22 - ahead and save it and you do that by
02:24 - right clicking it and press save and now
02:27 - just go ahead and it verifies where you
02:28 - want to save it and now you can see the
02:30 - a asterisk disappear so that's all the
02:33 - asterisk means make sure you save it or
02:35 - else when you excited the udk you're not
02:37 - going to have it so that is how you
02:40 - create a new package and add a new
02:42 - material to it but say you already have
02:44 - a package created so I already created
02:46 - this package I want to add a new
02:48 - material in this package anytime I
02:51 - already have a package created and I
02:52 - want to add an additional material just
02:54 - go ahead and right click anywhere in
02:56 - here and click new material there I go
02:59 - right there there and I could add a new
03:01 - material but for now I'm just going to
03:03 - stick with our one material don't want
03:04 - to jump ahead of ourselves so in order
03:07 - to open that material editor what we can
03:10 - do is we could have not xed out of it
03:13 - but I want to x out of it because I want
03:14 - to show you guys how to access it
03:16 - anytime you want to work with a material
03:19 - in the material editor go ahead and
03:21 - select your material in the content
03:22 - browser and go ahead and just double
03:25 - click it and whenever you double click
03:27 - it this thing called the material editor
03:29 - is going to pop up now the material
03:31 - editor is where we create our own custom
03:35 - materials pretty cool huh so let me give
03:38 - you guys a quick overview of the
03:40 - material editor in the upcoming
03:42 - tutorials I'm going to be teaching you
03:43 - guys how to add textures and how to add
03:46 - you know make your materials different
03:48 - colors and shiny and stuff like that but
03:50 - for now I'll just give you guys a quick
03:51 - overview because you know I have some
03:53 - extra time I might as well so the first
03:56 - thing I want to talk about is this
03:58 - toolbar white right up here here now
04:00 - just like when I was covering the uh udk
04:03 - in general a lot of these tools were not
04:06 - ready I'm basically going to be covering
04:08 - them as we go along So eventually we're
04:10 - going to know what all these tools mean
04:12 - but some of this stuff like toggle
04:14 - realtime material viewport we're not
04:15 - even close to learning with that as yet
04:17 - so instead of overwhelming you guys with
04:19 - like toggle expression real-time
04:21 - previews I'm just going to say these are
04:23 - tools that we're going to be covering
04:25 - later on now this black pan right here
04:28 - this is called the preview pane or the
04:30 - preview window I guess whatever you want
04:32 - to call it and whenever we create a
04:34 - material we can preview it in 3D on a 3D
04:37 - model for example if we made a material
04:40 - of wood we can go ahead and draw a
04:42 - sphere and it would show us what the
04:45 - material wood would look like on a
04:47 - sphere so it's pretty much just a
04:48 - preview Pane and that's why it says
04:50 - preview up there pretty cool huh now
04:53 - this big gray panel with this window
04:56 - floating around is called the materials
04:58 - expression window or panel I'm just
05:01 - gonna call them panels so without
05:03 - getting too in depth for now expressions
05:06 - are pretty much formulas that
05:09 - give they pretty much give you a value
05:12 - and they allow you to change the
05:14 - appearance of your material now again
05:17 - I'm going to be getting into this later
05:19 - but here's your material right here and
05:21 - here are all the different aspects or
05:23 - attributes of it the diffuse is the
05:26 - general color um the emissive is like
05:28 - the glow the specular is how shiny it is
05:31 - so what we're going to be doing is we're
05:32 - going to be bringing a formula like this
05:35 - and this formula is going to like output
05:37 - the number seven I'm just want to say
05:40 - that for a quick example and now when we
05:42 - give the value of seven to your diffuse
05:44 - it's going to like turn it blue or
05:46 - something so this pretty much outputs
05:47 - something and changes one of the
05:50 - attributes and again that was a pretty
05:52 - bad example I know I didn't really I'm
05:54 - just giving you guys a real quick
05:55 - example so anyways that's what the
05:58 - material expressions pain does if you
06:00 - don't understand it then you probably
06:01 - shouldn't because that was a pretty
06:02 - terrible example but over here is the
06:06 - Expressions list this is pretty much all
06:08 - the formulas that you can have and by
06:11 - the way I want to mention
06:12 - this the reason you need formulas
06:15 - instead of
06:16 - just constant numbers is say this you
06:19 - have a material that you want to apply
06:21 - to a spaceship well we can apply the
06:24 - color red to it or the color blue to it
06:27 - and it would stay red or blue forever
06:29 - but whenever you're playing a game you
06:31 - don't always want to apply a constant
06:33 - color so that's why you need formulas a
06:35 - formula can change its value so you're
06:38 - saying all right why would I want a
06:40 - material that changes its value well say
06:42 - you were modeling a spaceship or
06:44 - something and you had green lights on it
06:47 - but anytime that spaceship got shot the
06:50 - lights you might want to make turn red
06:52 - or something or maybe you had a gun and
06:54 - whenever you fired it the material would
06:56 - change to like a glowing fire material
06:59 - so that's why it has all these different
07:02 - properties and these formulas can change
07:05 - the properties as we go along so you see
07:07 - what I'm saying you see why we don't
07:09 - just apply a constant value to these
07:12 - attributes right here we actually need a
07:13 - formula to change those values if need
07:16 - be so with that being said the last
07:19 - thing I want to talk to you guys about
07:20 - is this expression list down here now
07:23 - this I mean excuse me this was the
07:25 - expression list right over here this
07:27 - down here is the properties panel
07:30 - now the properties panel whenever you
07:32 - don't have anything selected like here's
07:33 - a formula right here whenever I'm just
07:36 - going to deselect everything it gives
07:37 - you all your properties of your material
07:40 - that you're working on and since we
07:42 - don't even have a material we made yet
07:44 - it's not going to show us a whole lot of
07:45 - stuff but whenever we do we can adjust
07:48 - some of these settings it's pretty much
07:50 - allow you to adjust the settings of your
07:52 - material however once you have one of
07:54 - these things called an expression
07:56 - selected it allows you to edit the
07:58 - properties of that expression
08:00 - so depending on what you have selected
08:01 - if you have nothing selected it's just
08:03 - your general um material properties if
08:06 - you have an expression selected it gives
08:08 - you the properties of that expression
08:11 - and again I know you guys don't know
08:12 - what expressions or Properties or any of
08:15 - these attributes mean yet but trust me I
08:17 - just wanted to give you guys a quick
08:18 - overview of this material editor and by
08:21 - the end of these next like three
08:23 - tutorials you guys are going to be a pro
08:24 - at this so thank you guys for watching
08:26 - uh don't forget to subscribe and I'll
08:28 - see you guys in the next video
