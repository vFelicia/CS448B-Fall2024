00:00 - so what will happen is for each one when
00:01 - we click on here that should know it's
00:05 - not working so might just have error in
00:07 - my code let's take a look
00:09 - min length equals oh sorry I've said
00:13 - this Val I'm gonna say this cell
00:16 - refreshed up just click in here and you
00:19 - see that we get an alert dialog with
00:20 - five so let's go ahead now and just get
00:24 - rid of that and we'll go ahead and
00:28 - refresh and click on this one here and
00:29 - you can see that we've got ten so what
00:31 - we're doing is were successfully
00:33 - selecting the unique minimum length for
00:36 - any field that we sort of click onto and
00:39 - that's going to be useful because we
00:40 - want to add this span afterwards now
00:43 - there's a few things we need to check
00:44 - for the first one is if the minimum
00:46 - length doesn't equal zero the second one
00:49 - is if the minimum length is greater than
00:50 - zero because obviously we can't specify
00:52 - a minimum length of zero and also we
00:54 - want to check that the length of it is
00:57 - not always less than the minimum length
00:59 - so let's go ahead and create our if
01:01 - statement and we'll sort of put why I've
01:03 - said into practice let's bring that down
01:06 - and inside of our condition we need to
01:10 - say if min length doesn't equal zero
01:13 - because we obviously want to add the
01:15 - span afterwards if the min length is you
01:18 - know some has some kind of value and
01:20 - also when the min length is if the min
01:24 - length is greater than zero because we
01:25 - don't our our users to specify a min
01:28 - length of zero and we also want to check
01:32 - that this underscore cell dot value that
01:36 - just takes the contents of the text
01:38 - field and then we're using the original
01:39 - JavaScript length function and we want
01:43 - to make sure that that is less than the
01:45 - minimum length and essentially what this
01:48 - is gonna do is it's not going to show
01:49 - the span if the text is greater if the
01:53 - text is greater than the specified
01:55 - minimum length like I said earlier in
01:57 - the example we don't want to keep
01:58 - pestering our users with a message if
02:00 - their text is over the minimum length so
02:03 - if the all these are true we want to go
02:05 - ahead and they use this underscore cell
02:08 - dot
02:09 - after we're using the after function
02:11 - what this is essentially going to do is
02:13 - add an element straight or directly
02:15 - after this element here and let's just
02:18 - go ahead and refresh that to get our
02:20 - previous code so after what do we want
02:22 - to add we'll do we want to add a span to
02:25 - a couple of span tags so with this when
02:28 - we click on this the span tags will be
02:30 - generated let's just go ahead and put
02:32 - some test content in there for now and
02:34 - press f5 click on that and you see we
02:37 - get tests after each one and obviously
02:39 - they're just being added sort of after
02:41 - each time but we can do something to fix
02:43 - this but for now what we want to do is
02:46 - we want to a sort of displacement
02:47 - relevant data so what I want to do is I
02:49 - want to say append on min length and
02:54 - then I'm gonna say characters required
02:58 - and just to have a space after that span
03:01 - there so now what's going to happen is
03:02 - back to our to our browser when I click
03:05 - on it it says five characters required
03:07 - I'm gonna click on this it says 10
03:09 - characters required so we've added that
03:11 - functionality and quite easily what I
03:13 - now want to go ahead and do is avoid
03:15 - this problem of the duplication of the
03:17 - span so we want to add another event
03:20 - handler after dot focus and this is blur
03:25 - so inside of here essentially all we
03:28 - really want to do is let's just line
03:30 - that up all we want to do is go ahead
03:33 - and say this underscore cell dot next
03:37 - which is a directory traversing function
03:39 - so the next element after this current
03:42 - element which is obviously our input
03:43 - field so essentially next is our span
03:46 - that we've created up here and then we
03:48 - want to just say remove and that will
03:50 - just remove that element entirely so now
03:52 - when we click it and we navigate away ie
03:54 - we blur that will disappear whether we
03:57 - navigate to sort of you know the next
03:59 - field or whether we tab down to another
04:01 - field or tab back up to a field so we've
04:05 - got that functionality in there quite
04:06 - nicely now all we need to do is go ahead
04:08 - and add the functionality of when our
04:10 - user is typing to remove this message if
04:14 - they have successfully typed more than
04:16 - than specified minimum characters so
04:18 - just before this I'm going to go ahead
04:19 - and use a key up function
04:21 - oh the key up eventhandler and inside
04:24 - here create a function just bring that
04:25 - down so it looks quite untidy but
04:29 - essentially all the we're doing is we
04:30 - are sort of binding on different event
04:32 - handlers we want to go ahead and include
04:34 - an if statement here and this is going
04:36 - to be let's add the condition it's going
04:39 - to be if this underscore cell remember
04:42 - selecting the current thing or the
04:44 - current element value length so the
04:46 - length as we specified up here we use
04:48 - the same thing it'd probably be better
04:49 - to go ahead and put this in a variable
04:51 - somewhere but for now obviously because
04:54 - we're focusing on them we're sort of
04:56 - using the length we need to sort
04:58 - regenerate this data if it's greater
05:01 - than or equal to the minimum length I
05:04 - has the user typed either exactly five
05:07 - characters or exactly ten characters or
05:09 - more characters then we can go ahead and
05:11 - use this sorry this underscore cell next
05:15 - dot remove as we did down here as we
05:18 - blurred away so if the current that
05:21 - length of the value is greater than or
05:23 - equal to the minimum length specified we
05:26 - remove the span as well so now as well
05:28 - as clicking in and removing it as we
05:30 - blur out when we type something in here
05:33 - so some text you can see that it's
05:37 - removed so for example a lit but let's
05:40 - just get rid of that as we were to come
05:43 - in here and say Alex there we go so it
05:46 - removes it and then obviously when we
05:47 - tab down and we click back in because
05:49 - we've deleted this text it says five
05:51 - characters required so that's a sort of
05:54 - a quick example there are probably
05:56 - better ways to do this but it's a quick
05:58 - example of sort of how we can pop
06:00 - together things like this type of
06:02 - selector use a bit of directory
06:04 - traversing and also some quick simple
06:07 - logic to work out the lengths and apply
06:10 - this span afterwards as well so that's
06:13 - just a quick example of a minimum text
06:16 - length checker and how you would do that
06:18 - in jQuery
