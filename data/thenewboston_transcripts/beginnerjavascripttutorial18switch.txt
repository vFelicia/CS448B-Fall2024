00:00 - alright guys welcome back to your 18th
00:04 - tutorial shh shh close your eyes
00:08 - everyone close your eyes and imagine
00:11 - that you're making a computer program
00:13 - and imagine that you're making a
00:15 - computer program where the user has to
00:17 - enter a name of a girl like Taylor or
00:20 - Natalie or Ashley or Rebecca and
00:23 - depending on what name they answer it
00:26 - gives them a custom response like who
00:29 - you love Natalie or Ashley likes you -
00:32 - or something like that so let's go ahead
00:34 - and try to make this well the first
00:36 - thing we need is a variable named we'll
00:39 - just name it girl and we'll set it equal
00:41 - to said Natalie since natalie portman is
00:46 - my dream girl and now in order to make
00:49 - this program you might be thinking this
00:51 - with the tools we have so far we'll just
00:53 - go ahead and write if girl is equal to
00:56 - Natalie and then we can go ahead and do
01:00 - our thing and then light later we can
01:02 - write if girl is equal to Emily if girl
01:06 - is equal to Hannah if girl is equal to
01:09 - Reese and we can go ahead and list all
01:11 - the girls that they could enter and do
01:13 - it that way but a lot of if statements
01:17 - get kind of messy so there is a easier
01:19 - way to make kind of this same program
01:23 - type instead of using a bunch of if
01:25 - statements you can use a something
01:28 - called a switch statement a switch
01:30 - statement takes a one variable which is
01:33 - the girl in this case and it tests them
01:35 - for all the possible scenarios and it's
01:39 - you know it's basically the same as
01:40 - writing a bunch of statements but it's
01:43 - just a much more organized way so let's
01:46 - go ahead and let me show you the syntax
01:47 - for this is actually switch just like
01:50 - that and right after you write the name
01:53 - of the variable you only write the name
01:56 - of the variable nothing else you don't
01:57 - set it equal to anything just that now
02:00 - go ahead and make a body and give you
02:02 - some space
02:04 - and now for each case scenario we're
02:07 - gonna call it a case now for the first
02:10 - case you give it the value of what it
02:14 - can be equal to for example in the case
02:16 - of Natalie and go ahead and add a colon
02:20 - not a semicolon just go ahead and add a
02:23 - colon and now you write something like
02:25 - this if girl is equal to Natalie then go
02:29 - ahead and write whatever you want to do
02:32 - document.write you must like Garden
02:41 - State because that's my favorite movie
02:43 - when Natalie Portman believe it or not
02:44 - and then after every after you're done
02:47 - executing the code you go ahead and
02:49 - write the word break and I'll tell you
02:51 - why later so now we already have a case
02:54 - scenario for Natalie and this is
02:56 - basically the syntax of what we're gonna
02:58 - do for all the case scenarios so let's
03:01 - go ahead and copy that copy paste in the
03:05 - case of actually since I like Ashley
03:09 - green to be like ooh fan of Twila a day
03:14 - with a question mark and we keep doing
03:16 - that for each girl so I'm only gonna do
03:18 - two girls now but if you did a hundred a
03:21 - thousand a million it's gonna be the
03:23 - same syntax you write your switch in the
03:25 - variable that you want to test and in
03:27 - the body write case with a colon the
03:32 - code with a semicolon and break at the
03:34 - end now I guess I can do this the reason
03:38 - that you have break is this say you have
03:41 - a list of like 50 girls well it's going
03:43 - to test this one and then it's going to
03:45 - test this one and then it's going to
03:47 - text the next 48 and test them all until
03:50 - it gets to the answer well check this
03:53 - out
03:53 - since our girl is equal to Natalie right
03:55 - now what break means is this as soon as
03:59 - I get to this and I find an answer or
04:02 - find a value that that variable equals
04:04 - then there's no need to test the rest of
04:07 - these so I'm just going to break out of
04:09 - it right now and go to write to the end
04:12 - so if you have like Natalie Ashley
04:14 - Britney Emily
04:15 - as soon as it gets to Natalie it's gonna
04:17 - say alright I found my match I'm gonna
04:19 - break if you didn't have that break it's
04:21 - gonna go continue testing the rest of
04:24 - your stuff and it's just going to cause
04:25 - a mess why would you want to make your
04:27 - computer test the rest of your answers
04:29 - when you already found your answer it
04:30 - doesn't make sense so that's what that
04:32 - little break word means so you're saying
04:35 - all right let's go ahead and run this by
04:38 - default and see what we like you must
04:40 - like Garden State all right so as
04:43 - predicted this program worked perfectly
04:45 - but what if we have a name like Emily
04:49 - and we go ahead and save this and run
04:52 - and see what happens well nothing runs
04:54 - because we only had a choice for Natalie
04:57 - and Ashley well there are a lot of names
05:00 - that people can enter that probably
05:02 - aren't going to be in this list and
05:04 - probably you know names that are
05:06 - one-of-a-kind no one ever heard of so if
05:09 - you want to give your switch a default
05:12 - statement that says all right
05:14 - I'm gonna first go through my list of
05:16 - all my options and if I can't find a
05:19 - match then I'm just gonna give you a
05:21 - default answer so in order to give a
05:23 - default answer here's what you do de fa
05:27 - you ot and notice that we don't write
05:30 - anything in here because there is no
05:32 - like answer or value for default it's
05:35 - the default it's basically if you got to
05:38 - this and it didn't work in this it
05:40 - didn't work and then I'm gonna go here
05:42 - it's default so if all of your pretty
05:45 - much your cases don't match then this is
05:48 - what you get so by default just go ahead
05:51 - and write something like umm yeah I'm
05:54 - definitely copying this
05:57 - default right something like this is the
06:00 - default so check it out in another thing
06:03 - you don't need a break at the end of
06:05 - your default since it's the last choice
06:08 - so remember I said a break is pretty
06:11 - much to save you time saying RA once you
06:14 - found your answer then just break out of
06:16 - it and go continue with the next thing
06:18 - don't go through all the rest of the
06:20 - cases well you can add a break the end a
06:23 - default but it would be worth in a sense
06:25 - what if you get to the default you are
06:27 - ready at the end and you already ran out
06:29 - of all your cases so what's the break
06:32 - out of it's not skipping over anything
06:34 - it's not going to help you any to break
06:36 - out of it now you're already at the end
06:38 - so anyways that's why you don't need one
06:40 - so let's go ahead and test this variable
06:42 - Emily right now we have the variable
06:44 - Emily so what's going to happen is this
06:45 - Java scripts gonna say alright does
06:49 - Emily equal Nathalie nope does Emily
06:51 - equal Ashley nope so I guess I'm just
06:54 - going to give you the default this is
06:55 - your default statement so go ahead and
06:57 - save this and as you can see this is
07:00 - default so now let's go ahead and give
07:02 - it like Ashley just like that and now go
07:06 - ahead and save it and it's gonna say all
07:09 - right does Natalie equal Ashley you know
07:11 - does Ashley equal actually well indeed
07:13 - it does so I'm gonna go ahead and print
07:15 - out this just like he told me and then
07:17 - I'm gonna go ahead go go go ahead and
07:20 - then I'm gonna go ahead and break so no
07:23 - need to even worry about this at all so
07:25 - let's go ahead and save it and check it
07:27 - out Fanta Twila day Ashley green not bad
07:30 - so that's the basics of a switch
07:32 - statement and how you can use a switch
07:34 - statement to save you from writing a
07:36 - whole bunch of ifs and this is actually
07:38 - a whole lot easier to maintain and you
07:40 - know you can just look through your code
07:43 - and you know it's just a whole lot
07:45 - easier whenever we build programs that
07:47 - actually do something other than you
07:49 - know me talking about the girls I have a
07:51 - crush on that's what it does so anyways
07:55 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
07:56 - to subscribe and I'll see in the next
07:57 - video oh and natalie portman if you're
08:00 - watching call me
