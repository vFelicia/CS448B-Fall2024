00:00 - welcome back everyone my name is Sarah
00:02 - and in this video I'm going to talk
00:04 - about cells and cell structures just a
00:07 - random side note I picked up a Java
00:09 - monster Irish blend Irish coffee without
00:12 - the alcohol in it it is absolutely
00:15 - fantastic so now that I have a massive
00:18 - amount of caffeine and whatever other
00:20 - energy supplements they put in this
00:22 - thing I'm ready to go cells come in a
00:26 - variety of shapes and sizes they are you
00:29 - can have unicellular organisms which
00:31 - only have one cell or multicellular
00:35 - organisms which have two or more cells
00:37 - humans for example contain about 1
00:39 - trillion cells that's a lot of
00:43 - cells cells perform metabolic functions
00:46 - to sustain life and they divide to
00:49 - produce new cells that are
00:51 - identical the parts of a cell are known
00:53 - as organel or little organs most of
00:57 - these organel are only found in ukar
00:59 - iotic cells unless you decide to take a
01:02 - microbial diversity class in which case
01:05 - you will find that this is not
01:06 - completely true but you don't need to
01:09 - worry about this for the scope of basic
01:11 - biology anyways the first organel we are
01:14 - going to talk about is the cell membrane
01:17 - this is the outer boundary of a cell
01:18 - also called the plasma membrane this is
01:21 - composed of a by layer or double layer
01:24 - of phospholipid molecules with proteins
01:26 - embedded within if you remember from my
01:28 - organic chemistry lecture
01:30 - video rather a phospholipid you've got
01:35 - your lipid molecule here with your
01:37 - hydrophobic Tails hydrophobic meaning
01:39 - water hating and you've got your
01:41 - phosphate group here which is
01:43 - hydrophilic or water
01:45 - loving the cell membrane controls what
01:48 - enters and leaves the cell and it is
01:50 - semi-permeable which means some
01:52 - molecules can enter some
01:55 - can't and the model we use for the cell
01:58 - membrane is called the fluid fluid
02:00 - mosaic model you have your proteins
02:03 - embedded within the
02:05 - phospholipids there's another protein
02:08 - you've got the
02:10 - hydrophilic phosphate groups on the
02:12 - outside interacting with water and
02:14 - you've got the hydrophobic Tails facing
02:17 - each other so they interact with each
02:19 - other they don't have to worry about
02:20 - touching water or anything like that the
02:23 - cytoplasm it is all the cell material
02:27 - between the plasma membrane and the
02:28 - nucleus and organel are located within
02:31 - the
02:32 - cytoplasm you have the cytoskeleton
02:35 - these are proteins proteins that are
02:37 - located in the cytoplasm responsible for
02:39 - maintaining cellular shape holding
02:41 - organel in place moving the cell and
02:44 - moving structures within the cell and
02:46 - the cytoskeleton is composed of
02:48 - microfilaments and microtubules
02:50 - microfilaments are really long thin
02:53 - structures microtubules are tube tube
02:56 - shaped
02:58 - structures we next have the the
02:59 - endoplasmic reticulum or ER not to be
03:03 - confused with ET over here which is
03:05 - extraterrestrial anyways ER is a system
03:09 - of membranes extending from the nuclear
03:12 - membrane it control it's responsible for
03:14 - movement of materials through the cell
03:17 - synthesis of proteins and modification
03:19 - of other molecules and you have two
03:22 - different types you have rough
03:24 - endoplasmic reticulum which
03:26 - hasi organel called ribosomes bound to
03:29 - it and you have smooth endoplasmic
03:31 - reticulum which does not contain any
03:34 - ribosomes ribosomes are the sites of
03:38 - protein synthesis there are
03:40 - freestanding ribosomes which are just
03:43 - scattered throughout the cytoplasm or
03:45 - you have ribosomes that are attached to
03:48 - the ER ribosomes that are preing are
03:53 - involved with cellular protein synthesis
03:56 - ribosomes that are attached to the ER
03:58 - are involved with um proteins that are
04:00 - going to be exported from the cells we
04:03 - next have GOI bodies are also known as
04:05 - the GOI apparatus this is a series of
04:07 - membrane Stacks they receive what these
04:11 - little transport things called vesicles
04:15 - from the endoplasmic reticulum and they
04:18 - modify and package these molecules for
04:21 - transport and vesicles are just little
04:23 - storage areas that are enclosed by some
04:26 - sort of
04:27 - membrane vacul are big storage areas
04:32 - lomes are a special type of vacuum these
04:35 - contain digestive enzymes so if you were
04:39 - to bust open a lome within the cell it
04:42 - would destroy the cell it would eat the
04:45 - cell alive basically lomes are different
04:48 - because they have not one membrane but
04:51 - two membranes so two phospholipid B
04:54 - layers instead of just
04:56 - one next we have peroxisomes they're
04:59 - similar to lomes and they con contain
05:02 - enzymes or proteins that neutralize
05:05 - toxins glyoxysomes are similar to
05:08 - peroxisomes they contain enzymes
05:11 - proteins that convert fatty acids to
05:16 - carbohydrates we next have the
05:17 - mitochondria these are the powerhouses
05:20 - of the cells they have two membranes and
05:23 - inner membrane and an outer membrane the
05:26 - outer membrane separates the MIT Andria
05:30 - from the cytoplasm the inner membrane is
05:33 - the site of the electron transport chain
05:36 - and ATP adenosine triphosphate
05:39 - synthesis this is called they are the
05:42 - sites of cellular
05:43 - respiration the nucleus is the location
05:46 - of most of the DNA and RNA the cell
05:50 - makes it's also a double membrane so two
05:53 - membranes containing these big holes
05:56 - called pores where things can enter and
05:58 - leave the nucleus
06:00 - and within the nucleus is a structure
06:02 - called the nucleolus which is the site
06:04 - for synthesis and storage of
06:07 - RNA next we have fella and cyia these
06:11 - are
06:12 - cytoskelet cytoskeletal extensions from
06:15 - the cell's surface and they're involved
06:18 - with movement think of fella as these
06:22 - long tails that extend from the cell
06:25 - Celia are more like little itty bitty
06:28 - tiny hairs on the surface of the cell
06:31 - the cell wall is composed of different
06:33 - molecules depending on what type of
06:35 - organism you have organism you have for
06:38 - example plant cells have cell walls
06:41 - composed of cellulose fungi have cell
06:44 - walls composed of a molecule called
06:46 - kiten cell walls are very rigid they're
06:50 - involved with um structure and support
06:53 - of the cell as well and they are located
06:56 - outside of the plasma
06:58 - membrane plastids are found in organisms
07:01 - that are capable of
07:03 - photosynthesis you have lucast or amop
07:06 - plast that store a molecule called
07:09 - starch chromoplast store pigments which
07:13 - are involved with
07:15 - color different pigments produce
07:17 - different colors red white green blue
07:20 - what have you and then you have
07:21 - chloroplast which contain the molecule
07:24 - chlorophyll and these are the sites of
07:27 - photosynthesis and finally we have
07:29 - organel called centrioles which are
07:31 - involved in cell division you really
07:34 - only find these in animal
07:36 - cells but this is all I have for
07:38 - cellular structures in my next two
07:41 - videos I'll be going over the
07:43 - differences between plant and animal
07:45 - cells I'll show you pictures of
07:47 - everything so hopefully it'll make a
07:49 - little bit more sense
