00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - in the last video we looked at including
00:08 - jQuery into our page however we don't
00:11 - actually know whether we have this
00:12 - functionality available now if we save
00:15 - this page and go over to our um browser
00:20 - you'll see that we don't get any errors
00:22 - now this doesn't necessarily mean that
00:24 - jQuery has has has or has not been
00:27 - included into our page it's different to
00:29 - other language because it's just a
00:31 - script file so we're not sure yet um if
00:35 - uh jQuery is actually working this
00:37 - script tag will not return an error if
00:39 - this source is not found so it's
00:41 - extremely important that we just create
00:43 - a quick test to see if uh jQuery is
00:46 - working or not so don't worry if you
00:49 - don't understand the code I'm using just
00:51 - yet but if you are follow following
00:53 - along with this tutorial and you've
00:55 - included jQuery using this line um this
00:59 - uh line that I'm just about to write we
01:01 - just add some clarification whether to
01:03 - whether as to if we uh actually have
01:06 - included jQuery properly so I'm going to
01:09 - go ahead and create some paragraph tags
01:11 - and inside I'm going to write some text
01:13 - so this is some text or this is a
01:18 - paragraph would be more
01:20 - appropriate now the P will take other
01:23 - attributes uh such as
01:25 - onclick um on Mouse over and we can use
01:29 - stand JavaScript to then call uh the
01:32 - jQuery library or functions from the
01:34 - jQuery Library so let's go ahead and say
01:37 - p uh
01:39 - onclick now in normal JavaScript we
01:42 - could do something like alert or in raw
01:45 - JavaScript we could do something like
01:47 - alert
01:48 - works and when we click uh this text
01:52 - inside of this paragraph We will be
01:54 - produced with an alert box to say works
01:57 - so let's go ahead and test this first of
01:58 - all here's my paragraph and if I click
02:01 - it you can see that I get an alert box
02:03 - up saying works so JavaScript itself is
02:07 - obviously working because this is
02:08 - automatically uh available to us however
02:11 - we need to go ahead and test jQuery so
02:15 - let's go ahead and write a dollar inside
02:18 - of this dollar I'm going to write this
02:20 - or inside of these parentheses next to
02:22 - this dollar I'm going to write this and
02:24 - then I'm going to say do hide and then
02:27 - brackets and then a uh a semicolon to
02:29 - end this line so essentially what we're
02:32 - doing is hiding using the hide function
02:35 - and this which refers to the current
02:37 - element which is our paragraph element
02:40 - so this is jQuery code and this hide
02:43 - functionality is a function of jQuery so
02:46 - now if this works when we click on the
02:48 - paragraph This paragraph should be
02:49 - hidden we'll know that jQuery is
02:51 - actually working so let's go ahead to
02:54 - our browser and refresh the page here's
02:56 - the paragraph when I click it you'll see
02:58 - that the paragraph disappears so we now
03:01 - know that jQuery has been successfully
03:04 - included into our page
