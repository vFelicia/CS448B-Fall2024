00:00 - oh gosh will come to your 11th actually
00:05 - had to think about that for a second
00:07 - welcome to your 11th JavaScript tutorial
00:09 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:11 - talking about something called global
00:13 - and local variables so the concept of a
00:16 - global variable is simple it's any
00:18 - variable that you make that's outside
00:21 - any function and a local variable is
00:24 - simple it's any variable that you create
00:27 - inside the body of a function so I mean
00:30 - there are only two places you can make
00:31 - them simple enough but the rules when
00:34 - you use them they get kind of tricky so
00:36 - let me go ahead and show you guys let me
00:38 - first demonstrate what a global variable
00:40 - is and when you're allowed to use it
00:42 - let's go ahead and make a variable
00:43 - called Girl and I'll set it equal to the
00:45 - name of my first girlfriend called
00:47 - Kelsey I'm sure she will appreciate that
00:50 - so Kelsey if you're reading this what's
00:53 - up and so by the way she wasn't
00:57 - technically my first girlfriend I had a
00:59 - girlfriend in fourth grade named Nicole
01:01 - but we really didn't weren't
01:04 - boyfriend-girlfriend she just let me
01:05 - played with her Giga pet it wasn't
01:07 - nothing serious Kelsey I actually wound
01:09 - my first date with her we went and saw
01:11 - what was it the wedding singer with Adam
01:14 - Sandler and he had a mullet and I was
01:17 - extremely nervous the whole time hey I
01:19 - was in fifth grade give me a break guys
01:21 - and her mom drove us there in her van
01:24 - but still was pretty cool so anyways
01:25 - let's go ahead and make a function right
01:27 - now and we'll call this spit it really
01:29 - doesn't matter what you name it I'm
01:31 - gonna name it spit because it's gonna
01:32 - spit out this name so all this function
01:35 - is going to do is document dots right
01:37 - out on the screen the name of that
01:39 - variable girl now check the cell like I
01:42 - said you can make variables in one or
01:44 - two places inside the function right
01:46 - here or outside of the function where we
01:48 - made this girl since this variable is
01:51 - outside of the function we are allowed
01:53 - to use it inside the function right here
01:56 - now let's go ahead and let me prove it
01:59 - to you right now let's just go ahead and
02:00 - call spit it and when I run that line of
02:03 - code it's going to type out Kelsey and
02:05 - now let me go ahead and document dot
02:08 - right
02:10 - that variable and then this is going to
02:15 - print out Kelsey so anyways the point
02:18 - I'm trying to get across is whenever you
02:21 - have a variable outside of function you
02:23 - can use it both in the function and
02:25 - anywhere else in the program so let me
02:27 - go ahead and refresh this and it says
02:29 - Kelsey Kelsey just as we predicted
02:32 - simple enough but now let's go ahead and
02:35 - take this variable cut it and there we
02:40 - go and let's go ahead and make it inside
02:42 - this function right here so now inside
02:45 - this function we created a variable
02:47 - called Girl and we're going to try to
02:49 - run it inside this function and outside
02:51 - the function so now let's go ahead and
02:53 - refresh and it actually had to save that
02:56 - and refresh and we see we only get one
02:59 - Kelsey
03:00 - well why is that we made the variable it
03:02 - didn't have any typos we didn't forget
03:04 - to semicolon or anything so why is this
03:06 - Kelsey only appearing once well like I
03:09 - said with global variables whenever you
03:11 - create a variable outside your function
03:13 - you could use it in any function you
03:15 - want and also anywhere else in your
03:17 - program but whenever you create a
03:19 - variable that's inside a function you
03:22 - can only use that variable inside that
03:24 - function if we had another function we
03:27 - couldn't use it in that if we had
03:28 - another function could use it in that
03:30 - and we're not allowed to use it outside
03:32 - that function this function is very
03:33 - greedy it says whatever my variable is I
03:37 - create there mine no one else is getting
03:39 - them boy so that's why whenever we call
03:42 - it spit it printed out Kelsey because
03:44 - this was the function and then when we
03:46 - tried to just use it on our own
03:48 - it wouldn't let us because it said all
03:50 - right the variable that I curry it's
03:52 - mine I get to keep it so that's why it
03:54 - only printed out once that was the
03:56 - functions call not the one outside so
03:59 - anyways the point I'm trying to get
04:00 - across global variables when they're
04:03 - created outside any function you can use
04:06 - them anywhere inside functions outside
04:07 - functions whatever but whenever you
04:10 - create a variable inside a function it's
04:12 - called a local variable and that
04:13 - variable can only be used within the
04:16 - function in which it's declared aka
04:18 - created so that is your basics of global
04:22 - and local variables in yes
04:24 - that is the technical term from global
04:26 - and local so if you have a test it's
04:27 - okay to write global and local so thank
04:29 - you guys for watching I think you guys
04:31 - for putting up with my history of fifth
04:34 - grade girlfriends and I hope you enjoyed
04:36 - and hey again Kelsey if you're watching
04:38 - what's up
