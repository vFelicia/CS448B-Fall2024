00:00 - all right ladies and gentlemen welcome
00:02 - to your 27th udk tutorial and this is
00:04 - one of the last tutorials I'm going to
00:06 - be going over when it comes to materials
00:08 - it's this one and then I got one more so
00:10 - 27 28 and then I'm going to be going to
00:13 - food lion grams some oatmeal cream pies
00:15 - and watching some netflix movies so we
00:18 - only got two more tutorials on materials
00:20 - to go and then we can move on to the
00:21 - next topic so in this tutorial I'm going
00:24 - to teaching you guys about emissive
00:26 - materials now we can go ahead and look
00:28 - at the emissive property right here and
00:30 - the emissive property or attribute of a
00:33 - material is pretty much the glow so we
00:37 - can have like a spaceship with lights on
00:39 - it and we can make those lights emissive
00:41 - AKA glow pretty cool huh so I already
00:44 - know what material I want to work with
00:46 - so go ahead and select textures right
00:49 - here and we're going to be grabbing two
00:50 - textures now go ahead and search wall
00:53 - light and I found this one in this one
00:57 - right here and by the way I want to give
00:59 - you guys this little tip whenever you're
01:01 - looking through textures you can kind of
01:04 - see what they're used for by the last
01:06 - letter for example this last letter is d
01:09 - this means it should be plugged into the
01:11 - diffuse property this one is n this one
01:15 - should be plugged into the normal map
01:16 - this one is e m that means a missive map
01:19 - so we're going to be grabbing that one
01:21 - for the emissive map by anyways since
01:23 - this is the that's the one we want for
01:25 - diffuse so go ahead and we're going to
01:27 - be making out of fuse and in a missive
01:30 - texture so now let me give you guys
01:32 - another shortcut in order to add
01:34 - textures really quick just go ahead and
01:36 - hold T on your keyboard and click so I'm
01:38 - going to click with T right there and
01:40 - it's going to add my texture and I'm
01:42 - going to click with T right here and
01:44 - it's going to add my texture now this
01:46 - one is already set up since we had this
01:48 - selected in the content browser so go
01:50 - ahead and hook this up to diffuse
01:52 - however this one is the wrong one I just
01:55 - wanted to add that real quick so we will
01:57 - actually want to associate this texture
01:59 - with this emissive mapper here so make
02:01 - sure you have this a Miss and map
02:03 - selected and go ahead and hit this green
02:05 - arrow which means use the selected
02:07 - object in the content browser and
02:09 - whenever you hit that it switches over
02:10 - to your missing absence
02:12 - this was a texture that was selected so
02:14 - now go ahead and expand that because i'm
02:16 - done with the content browser and also
02:18 - expand your preview window just because
02:21 - i think you look better and now look
02:23 - what happens whenever i plug this a
02:25 - missive map into this missive property
02:27 - keep your eye on the preview window
02:28 - whenever i plug it in those lights kind
02:31 - of light up and that's basically what an
02:34 - emissive map is an emissive map is
02:36 - basically a black-and-white map and the
02:40 - white parts tell the udk what parts of
02:43 - your material needs to glow so wherever
02:46 - this a Miss map is white that's the part
02:48 - that glows wherever it's black that's
02:50 - the part that stays dark pretty cool huh
02:52 - so now you're saying all right that's
02:54 - pretty cool but what if I want to kind
02:56 - of change my lights a little bit say for
02:58 - example I want to make them a new color
03:00 - or I want to make them brighter or
03:02 - dimmer well in order to do that the
03:04 - easiest way is probably to add a
03:06 - materials expression so go ahead and
03:08 - we're going to go ahead and delete this
03:11 - connection right here and actually I'm
03:12 - going to drag this back so what we need
03:15 - to do is we need to add a multiply
03:18 - expression what the heck was that noise
03:21 - that I just get it email you guys hear
03:23 - that anyways go ahead and hold em on
03:26 - your keyboard and left-click and this is
03:28 - a shortcut to add a multiply so go ahead
03:31 - and let me see how i want to set things
03:33 - up I actually want to control this down
03:36 - here and there we go so what we're going
03:39 - to be doing is we're actually going to
03:41 - be hooking up this multiplied to the
03:43 - emissive and now this multiplied needs
03:45 - two values in which to multiply just go
03:47 - ahead and plug in this one for B and you
03:51 - remember before when we use that
03:52 - constant three vector i'll go ahead and
03:54 - show you if you right-click constant
03:56 - constant three vector this is a vector
03:59 - with the r g and b value so go ahead and
04:03 - grab all of those and plug them into a
04:05 - and basically this red is going to be
04:09 - multiplied by this red this green is
04:12 - going to be multiplied by this screen in
04:13 - this blue is going to be multiplied by
04:15 - this blue but if we see right now since
04:18 - all of these values are 0 this red green
04:21 - and blue is going to multiply by zero
04:24 - and remember anytime you have a number
04:26 - and you multiply by zero the outcome is
04:28 - zero so right now we're getting these
04:31 - three RGB values we're multiplying them
04:33 - by 000 in our outcome is 0 0 0 so this
04:38 - basically has no emissive properties
04:40 - right now and we can verify that by
04:42 - taking away this connection you see when
04:45 - we take it away and add it take it away
04:47 - and add it our material doesn't change
04:50 - glow so what we need to do is we need to
04:52 - change the globe properties and we do
04:55 - that by changing the mult or excuse me
04:57 - the constant 3 vector properties so
05:00 - let's go ahead and boost one of these
05:02 - colors by the way by default if you want
05:04 - to get your old glow back just type 1 11
05:07 - and there's your old glow back so say we
05:11 - want to add a little more let me think
05:13 - of a cool number let me go ahead and
05:15 - boost my green by like eight hundred and
05:19 - then go ahead and focus away from that
05:21 - and now you can see we get in a nice
05:23 - powerful green glow and this green glow
05:27 - needs a little bit of blue so I'm going
05:28 - to go ahead and boost that by 200 and
05:30 - check it out I get this nice looking
05:33 - green and blue glow pretty cool huh so
05:36 - here's what's happening it's taken the
05:38 - red value and multiplying it by this red
05:41 - value so we get the same since any
05:43 - number times 1 is itself it's taking the
05:46 - green and boosting it by 800 and taking
05:49 - the blue and boosting that by 200 so now
05:52 - since your boosted the green and blue we
05:54 - get a nice green and blue effect and
05:57 - we've done all that by taking pretty
05:59 - much to list of color multiply them
06:02 - together and getting the final list of
06:04 - color which we plugged into the emissive
06:06 - property so that's basically how we work
06:08 - with the emissive property to control
06:10 - the glow of our material so thank you
06:13 - guys for watching if you have any
06:14 - questions don't forget to sign up for my
06:16 - forum and I'll answer them for you then
06:18 - so thank you guys one last time and i'll
06:20 - see you guys in the next video
